Mullett\n\nAlfred Bult Mullett (April 7, 1834 – October 20, 1890) was a British-American architect who served from 1866 to 1874 as Supervising Architect, head of the agency of the United States Treasury Department that designed federal government buildings. His work followed trends in Victorian style, evolving from the Greek Revival to Second Empire to Richardsonian Romanesque.\n\nMullett was born at Taunton in Somerset, England. When he was eight years old, his family emigrated to Glendale, Ohio, where in 1843 his father bought an 80-acre (32 hectares) farm. He matriculated at Farmers' College in College Hill, Cincinnati, studied mathematics and mechanical drawing, but left as a sophomore in 1854. He trained in the Cincinnati office of architect Isaiah Rogers and became a partner, until he left on less than friendly terms in 1860, to establish his own practice. His first known individual design is the Church of the New Jerusalem, a board-and-batten Gothic Revival church built at Glendale in 1861.\n\nAfter serving with the Union army, Mullett in 1863 relocated to Washington to again work under Rogers, since 1862 the \"de facto\" Supervising Architect at the Treasury Department. But he undermined his superior's position until an exasperated Rogers resigned in 1865, the year Mullet married Pacific Pearl Myrick. Although widely dismissed as \"an obscure draftsman\" from Cincinnati, he used political skill to get appointed Supervising Architect in 1866, and so designed fireproof federal buildings across the nation, particularly custom houses, post offices and courthouses. Responsible for contracting local architects and/or construction companies to deal with subcontractors, source materials and other matters, he gained a reputation as a micromanaging authoritarian with an explosive temper.\n\nInfluenced by the 1864–1868 remodeling of the Louvre's Pavillon de Flore by Hector Lefuel and Richard Morris Hunt, Mullett produced six massive fortress-like Second Empire federal buildings in St. Louis, Boston, Philadelphia, Cincinnati, New York and Washington D.C., where the State, War, and Navy Building rose near the White House. These stone and cast iron structures, with mansard roofs and multiple tiers of columns, were expensive. He was dogged by accusations of extravagance and subjected to five separate investigations into his ties to the corrupt \"Granite Ring\". Mullett reluctantly resigned in 1874 while under attack from reforming Treasury Secretary Benjamin Bristow and others.\n\nHe was investigated for negligence when three men were killed on May 1, 1877 by a floor failure at the City Hall Post Office, New York City. In 1882, he set up a practice in New York with Hugo Kafka and William G. Steinmetz, later establishing Alfred B. Mullett & Sons to practice with his two elder sons. But the government never paid him for major commissions, and he remained a popular political target. The \"New York Sun\" called him \"the most arrogant, pretentious, and preposterous little humbug in the United States.\" In 1890, in financial trouble and ill health, Mullett killed himself in Washington. Over his career he produced some 40 government buildings, and two of the six huge Second Empire piles remain standing in St. Louis and Washington. During the Modernist period, critics accused him of using overblown ornament to hide weak form. The New York City Hall Post Office was dubbed \"Mullett's monstrosity.\" Following another shift in popular taste, however, he is recognized for his contribution to monumental Victorian architecture.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24128922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24128922", "title": "Algae bioreactor", "text": "Algae bioreactor\n\nAn algae bioreactor is used for cultivating micro or macro algae. Algae may be cultivated for the purposes of biomass production (as in a seaweed cultivator), wastewater treatment, CO fixation, or aquarium/pond filtration in the form of an algae scrubber. Algae bioreactors vary widely in design, falling broadly into two categories: open reactors and enclosed reactors. Open reactors are exposed to the atmosphere while enclosed reactors, also commonly called photobioreactors, are isolated to varying extent from the atmosphere. Specifically, algae bioreactors can be used to produce fuels such as biodiesel and bioethanol, to generate animal feed, or to reduce pollutants such as NO and CO in flue gases of power plants. Fundamentally, this kind of bioreactor is based on the photosynthetic reaction which is performed by the chlorophyll-containing algae itself using dissolved carbon dioxide and sunlight energy. The carbon dioxide is dispersed into the reactor fluid to make it accessible for the algae. The bioreactor has to be made out of transparent material.\n\nThe algae are photoautotroph organisms which perform oxygenic photosynthesis.\n\nThe equation for photosynthesis:\n\nSome of the first experiments with the aim of cultivating algae were conducted in 1957 by the \"Carnegie Institution\" in Washington. In these experiments, monocellular Chlorella were cultivated by adding CO and some minerals. In the early days, bioreactors were used which were made of glass and later changed to a kind of plastic bag. The goal of all this research has been the cultivation of algae to produce a cheap animal feed.\n\nNowadays 3 basic types of algae photobioreactors have to be differentiated, but the determining factor is the unifying parameter – the available intensity of sunlight energy.\n\nA plate reactor simply consists of vertically arranged or inclined rectangular boxes which are often divided in two parts to effect an agitation of the reactor fluid. Generally these boxes are arranged to a system by linking them. Those connections are also used for making the process of filling/emptying, introduction of gas and transport of nutritive substances, easier. The introduction of the flue gas mostly occurs at the bottom of the box to ensure that the carbon dioxide has enough time to interact with algae in the reactor fluid.\n\nA tubular reactor consists of vertical or horizontal arranged tubes, connected together to a pipe system. The algae-suspended fluid is able to circulate in this tubing. The tubes are generally made out of transparent plastics or borosilicate glass and the constant circulation is kept up by a pump at the end of the system. The introduction of gas takes place at the end/beginning of the tube system. This way of introducing gas causes the problem of deficiency of carbon dioxide, high concentration of oxygen at the end of the unit during the circulation, and bad efficiency.\n\nA bubble column photo reactor consists of vertical arranged cylindrical column, made out of transparent material. The introduction of gas takes place at the bottom of the column and causes a turbulent stream to enable an optimum gas exchange. At present these types of reactors are built with a maximum diameter of 20 cm to 30 cm in order to ensure the required supply of sunlight energy.\n\nThe biggest problem with the sunlight determined construction is the limited size of the diameter. Feuermann et al. invented a method to collect sunlight with a cone shaped collector and transfer it with some fiberglass cables which are adapted to the reactor in order to enable constructions of a column reactor with wider diameters. - on this scale the energy consumption due to pumps etc. and the CO cost of manufacture may outweigh the CO captured by the reactor.\n\nThe cultivation of algae in a photobioreactor creates a narrow range of industrial application possibilities.\nSome power companies already established research facilities with algae photobioreactors to find out how efficient they could be in reducing CO emissions, which are contained in flue gas, and how much biomass will be produced. Algae biomass has many uses and can be sold to generate additional income. The saved emission volume can bring an income too, by selling emission credits to other power companies.\n\nThe utilisation of algae as food is very common in East Asian regions. Most of the species contain only a fraction of usable proteins and carbohydrates, and a lot of minerals and trace elements. Generally, the consumption of algae should be minimal because of the high iodine content, particularly problematic for those with hyperthyroidism. Likewise, many species of diatomaceous algae produce compounds unsafe for humans. The algae, especially some species which contain over 50 percent oil and a lot of carbohydrates, can be used for producing biodiesel and bioethanol by extracting and refining the fractions. This point is very interesting, because the algae biomass is generated 30 times faster than some agricultural biomass, which is commonly used for producing biodiesel.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "21855574", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21855574", "title": "Brain simulation", "text": "Brain simulation\n\nBrain simulation is the concept of creating a functioning computer model of a brain or part of a brain. Modelling a brain (or brain subsystem) involves both modelling neurons' electrical and bulk chemical properties (e.g. extracellular serotonin gradients). A model of the neural connectome of the target organism is also required. The connectome is extremely complex, and its detailed wiring is not yet understood; thus it is presently being modeled empirically in smaller mammals by projects like the Blue Brain Project. \n\nThe Blue Brain Project intends to create a computer simulation of a mammalian cortical column down to the molecular level. By one estimate, a full reconstruction of the human connectome using the methodology of the Blue Brain Project would require a zettabyte of data storage. In 2013, Human Brain Project created a Brain Simulation Platform (BSP), which is an internet-accessible collaborative platform designed for the simulation of brain models. The Human Brain Project has utilized techniques used by the Blue Brain Project and built upon them. \n\nBrain simulation projects intend to contribute to a complete understanding of the brain, and eventually assist the process of treating and diagnosing brain diseases.\n\nThe connectivity of the neural circuit for touch sensitivity of the simple C. elegans nematode (roundworm) was mapped in 1985 and partly simulated in 1993. Since 2004, many software simulations of the complete neural and muscular system have been developed, including simulation of the worm's physical environment. Some of these models have been made available for download. However, there is still a lack of understanding of how the neurons and the connections between them generate the surprisingly complex range of behaviors that are observed in the relatively simple organism. This contrast between the apparent simplicity of how the mapped neurons interact with their neighbours, and exceeding complexity of the overall brain function, is an example of an emergent property. This kind of emergent property is paralleled within artificial neural networks, the neurons of which are exceedingly simple compared to their often complex, abstract outputs.\n\nThe brain of the fruit fly, Drosophila, has also been thoroughly studied. A simulated model of the fruit fly's brain offers a unique model of sibling neurons.\n\nHenry Markram mapped the types of neurons within the mouse brain and their connections between 1995 and 2005.\n\nIn December 2006, the Blue Brain project completed a simulation of a rat's neocortical column. The neocortical column is considered the smallest functional unit of the neocortex. The neocortex is the part of the brain thought to be responsible for higher-order functions like conscious thought, and contains 10,000 neurons in the rat brain (and 10 synapses). In November 2007, the project reported the end of its first phase, delivering a data-driven process for creating, validating, and researching the neocortical column.\n\nAn artificial neural network described as being \"as big and as complex as half of a mouse brain\" was run on an IBM Blue Gene supercomputer by the University of Nevada's research team in 2007. Each second of simulated time took ten seconds of computer time. The researchers claimed to observe \"biologically consistent\" nerve impulses that flowed through the virtual cortex. However, the simulation lacked the structures seen in real mice brains, and they intend to improve the accuracy of the neuron and synapse models.\n\nBlue Brain is a project that was launched in May 2005 by IBM and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne. The intention of the project was to create a computer simulation of a mammalian cortical column down to the molecular level. The project uses a supercomputer based on IBM's Blue Gene design to simulate the electrical behavior of neurons based upon their synaptic connectivity and ion permeability. The project seeks to eventually reveal insights into human cognition and various psychiatric disorders caused by malfunctioning neurons, such as autism, and to understand how pharmacological agents affect network behavior.\n\nThe Human Brain Project (HBP) is a 10-year program of research funded by the European Union. It began in 2013 and employs around 500 scientists across Europe. It includes 6 platforms: \n\n\nThe Brain Simulation Platform (BSP) is a device for internet-accessible tools, which allows investigations that are not possible in the laboratory. They are applying Blue Brain techniques to other brain regions, such as the cerebellum, hippocampus, and the basal ganglia.\n"}
{"id": "20731515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20731515", "title": "Central governor", "text": "Central governor\n\nThe central governor is a proposed process in the brain that regulates exercise in regard to a neurally calculated safe exertion by the body. In particular, physical activity is controlled so that its intensity cannot threaten the body’s homeostasis by causing anoxic damage to the heart muscle. The central governor limits exercise by reducing the neural recruitment of muscle fibers. This reduced recruitment causes the sensation of fatigue. The existence of a central governor was suggested to explain fatigue after prolonged strenuous exercise in long-distance running and other endurance sports, but its ideas could also apply to other causes of exertion-induced fatigue.\n\nThe existence of a central governor was proposed by Tim Noakes in 1997, but a similar idea was suggested in 1924 by Archibald Hill.\n\nIn contrast to this idea is the one that fatigue is due to peripheral ‘limitation’ or ‘catastrophe’. In this view, regulation by fatigue occurs as a consequence of a failure of homeostasis directly in muscles.\n\nThe 1922 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine winner Archibald Hill proposed in 1924 that the heart was protected from anoxia in strenuous exercise by the existence of a governor.\n\nThis hypothesis was disregarded and further research upon exercise fatigue was modeled in terms of it being due to a mechanical failure of the exercising muscles (\"peripheral muscle fatigue\"). This failure was caused either by an inadequate oxygen supply to the exercising muscles, lactic acid buildup, or total energy depletion in the exhausted muscles.\n\nTim Noakes, a professor of exercise and sports science at the University of Cape Town, in 1997 has renewed Hill’s argument on the basis of modern research.\n\nIn his approach, the power output by muscles during exercise is continuously adjusted in regard to calculations made by the brain in regard to a safe level of exertion. These neural calculations factor in earlier experience with strenuous exercise, the planning duration of the exercise, and the present metabolic state of the body. These brain models ensure that body homeostasis is protected, and an emergency reserve margin is maintained. This neural control adjusts the number of activated skeletal muscle motor units, a control which is subjectively experienced as fatigue. This process, though occurring in the brain, is outside conscious control.\n\nNoakes created the idea of the central governor in the context of prolonged endurance running. However, he has noted that the central processes involved might also underlie the existence of other kinds of fatigue:\n\nIn support of this, placebos (which must be mediated by a central process) have a powerful effect upon not only fatigue in prolonged exercise, but also upon short term endurance exercise such as sprint speed, the maximum weight that could be lifted with leg extension, and the tolerance of ischemic pain and power when a tourniqueted hand squeezes a spring exerciser 12 times.\n\nThe existence of a central governor over physiology has been questioned since ‘physiological catastrophes’ can and do occur in athletes (important examples in marathons have been Dorando Pietri, Jim Peters and Gabriela Andersen-Schiess). This suggests that humans can over-ride ‘the central governor’. Moreover, a variety of peripheral factors in addition to those such as lactic acid build up can impair muscle power and might act to protect against \"catastrophe\". Another objection is that models incorporating conscious control also provide an alternative explanation (see Noakes’ reply).\n\nExercise fatigue has also been attributed to the direct effects of exercise upon the brain such as increased cerebral levels of serotonin, reduced level of glutamate secondary to uptake of ammonia in the brain, brain hyperthermia, and glycogen depletion in brain cells.\n\n"}

He was reported missing by his family after he failed to show up to work. On 27 September, his car was found dumped at Waratah Park Reserve in Sutherland; evidence suggested he did not park it there and police believed he \"met with foul play\". In August 2008, Leveson's boyfriend, Michael Atkins, was arrested and charged with murder. In October 2009, Atkins was acquitted of murder and an alternative charge of manslaughter, following a four-week trial.\n\nIn November 2016, the New South Wales Attorney General agreed to an immunity deal with Atkins, which protected him from perjury in exchange for leading police to Leveson's remains. The search began on 10 November, but was called off on 17 November, after no leads were found. Police resumed searching on 25 May 2017 and discovered Leveson's remains on 31 May. An inquest into his death delivered an open finding on 5 December, with the deputy state coroner stating there was insufficient evidence to determine how or why Leveson died.\n\nLeveson was at Arq nightclub in Darlinghurst, New South Wales, in the early morning of 23 September 2007, with close friends and his boyfriend, 45-year-old Michael Peter Atkins. He was last seen on CCTV leaving the club at around 2 am with Atkins. Atkins returned to Arq about an hour later without Leveson. At 3:20 am, Leveson sent a text message to a friend saying, \"Mike's having a f. king cry, he is taking me home and won't let me stay! F. king c. t!\" A minute later, he sent another message: \"He needs to f. king get over himself\". Later that day, at 12:20 pm, CCTV cameras captured Atkins buying a mattock and duct tape at Bunnings Warehouse in Taren Point.\n\nOn 25 September, Leveson's parents, Mark and Faye, reported their son missing after he failed to show up to work. On 27 September, Leveson's car, a green 1999 Toyota Corolla hatchback, was found abandoned outside of a public toilet at Waratah Park Reserve in Sutherland, a known \"gay beat\". A Bunnings receipt with Atkins's fingerprints on it was found in the boot. A speaker system had also been removed from the boot; it was later found in the garage area of the unit Atkins shared with Leveson. Police did not believe Leveson parked his car there, based on evidence found, and suspected foul play.\n\nOn 5 August 2008, Atkins was arrested at his apartment in Cronulla and charged with murder.\n\nOn 3 September 2009, Atkins's trial began in the Supreme Court of New South Wales. On 20 October, the jury found Atkins not guilty of murder and an alternative charge of manslaughter.\n\nOn most weekends since 2008, Mark and Faye searched the Royal National Park with picks and shovels in search of their son's remains. Their starting point was where Leveson's car was found. They searched at around 2 am looking for suitable places and would return in the daytime to \"search properly\".\n\nIn November 2016, Gabrielle Upton, the Attorney General of New South Wales, agreed to an immunity deal with Atkins, which protected him from \"being charged with perjury if he showed police where the body was\". The specific terms of the deal were \"no body, no deal\". On 10 November, police began a large-scale search of the Royal National Park using information provided by Atkins, but no remains were found and the search was called off on 17 November. Another search was undertaken in January 2017, but no remains were found. On 25 May 2017, police resumed the search and on 31 May, skeletal remains were uncovered beneath a cabbage-tree palm. DNA testing confirmed that they belonged to Leveson. The Levesons took the tree and planted it in their backyard.\n\nOn 5 December 2017, the deputy state coroner, Elaine Truscott, delivered an open finding at the inquest of Leveson's death. There was insufficient evidence to \"positively determine — to the requisite standard — how or why Matt died\". Leveson's father Mark said, \"There's some relief, there's some frustration, there's some anger, so there's lots of emotions going through us but relief's one of the ones right now\".\n\n"}

It was written by Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, and first aired on 14 March 2017, on BBC Two. The episode, which was directed by Guillem Morales, follows the story of David, played by Shearsmith, a middle class stay-at-home dad, who happens across a lone black shoe. Much to the concern of his wife Louise, played by Keeley Hawes, he becomes obsessed with finding the shoe's owner. The episode follows the development of his obsession. Rosa Strudwick plays Sally, David and Louise's daughter, and Pemberton plays Chris, a family friend. Danny Baker voices a radio presenter, and Mathew Baynton also appears.\n\nThe episode was inspired by Pemberton's own chance encounter with a single shoe. The episode is split into four, corresponding to the four seasons, and features extracts of Vivaldi's \"The Four Seasons\". The cinematography features many views of symmetrical pairs of objects, as well as shots of empty rooms. The device of the seasons, as well as the music and cinematography, relate to David's emotional state. Critics responded very positively to \"Diddle Diddle Dumpling\", particularly praising Morales's direction and the performances of Shearsmith, Hawes, and Baynton.\n\nThe third series of \"Inside No. 9\" was announced in October 2015, and heavily publicised in January 2016, at which time Keeley Hawes and Mathew Baynton were named as guest stars in the series. \"Diddle Diddle Dumpling\" was the fifth and penultimate episode of the series, and the fourth of a run of five episodes beginning February 2017—the series's first episode being the December 2016 Christmas special \"The Devil of Christmas\". It first aired on 14 March 2017, on BBC Two.\n\n\"Diddle Diddle Dumpling\" was inspired by a chance encounter that Pemberton had with a single shoe on his way to work, leading him to consider the result of someone obsessively attempting to return it to its rightful owner. He claimed that the episode's premise then came to him \"fully formed\". He took Shearsmith to see the shoe, and the pair began writing the episode immediately. Coincidentally, Shearsmith also encountered a single shoe some days later, though it did not match the first. \"You start seeing them everywhere\", Shearsmith noted, \"once you start looking\". For Pemberton, this inspiration worked because it was completely random; were he to have gone out look for inspiration, he claimed, it would not have worked. The episode is split into four, corresponding to the four seasons, and features music from Vivaldi's \"The Four Seasons\". It takes its name from the nursery rhyme \"Diddle, Diddle, Dumpling, My Son John\".\n\n\"Diddle Diddle Dumpling\" starred Shearsmith as David, Hawes as David's wife Louise, Rosa Strudwick as the couple's daughter Sally, and Pemberton as Chris, a family friend. Danny Baker voiced a radio presenter, and Baynton appeared as Ted. When contacted about appearing in \"Inside No. 9\", Hawes was starring in \"The Durrells\". However, as \"Diddle Diddle Dumpling\" would take only a week to film, she was able to move straight from \"The Durrells\" to \"Inside No. 9\". Her respective characters, despite having close names, were very different. According to Pemberton, Hawes had hoped to dislike the script so that she could turn down the role. When she read it, however, she could not resist.\n\n\"Diddle Diddle Dumpling\" was the \"Inside No. 9\" producer Adam Tandy's favourite episode of the series, while Pemberton considered it one of the best. Shearsmith identified David as one of his favourite characters from the series, and said that he fondly remembered working with Hawes, whom he praised as a performer. Hawes commended \"Inside No. 9\", the episode's script, and Morales's direction, expressing how much she had enjoyed working with Pemberton and Shearsmith, as well as the amount she had laughed during the filming process.\n\nDavid, a middle class stay-at-home dad, lives with his wife Louise and daughter Sally. While out jogging, he encounters a single slip-on dress shoe. David keeps an eye on the shoe, and, by the time Louise arrives home that evening, has moved it to the dinner table. Louise drops it on the floor, though David's attention remains on it. Later, in daytime, David chastises Sally for playing with the shoe, and Louise is angry that he has hung posters advertising his find that feature their phone number.\n\nThe family celebrate Sally's birthday, while the shoe sits under a sofa. Later, Chris, a family friend, visits. He may have a job for David, but, to Louise's horror, David begins talking about his \"project\". Louise has binned the shoe; David is mortified, and Louise challenges him to not speak about the shoe for two minutes. He fails, and storms out to search the bin. Louise and Chris share a tender moment, but David does not notice; he is more concerned with how Chris could help him publicise his search for the shoe's owner. David's multimedia campaign and reward offer, initially unsuccessful, ultimately result in a visit from a young man who has a matching shoe. David interrogates him at length. Once satisfied by his account, and having spent a final few moments alone with the newly matched pair, he reluctantly hands it over, holding back tears.\n\nSally and Louise are happy in the kitchen, when David, smartly dressed and with a confident manner, returns from work. Despite Louise's reservations, Sally performs a piece she will present in her school assembly, involving the nursery rhyme \"Diddle, Diddle, Dumpling\":\n\n<poem>\nDiddle, diddle, dumpling, my son John,\nWent to bed with his trousers on!\nOne shoe off, and one shoe on,\nDiddle, diddle, dumpling, my son John!\n</poem>\n\nDespite a pained expression, David applauds, hugging his daughter.\n\nLouise encounters the shoe outside her house. Inside, David confronts her about a photograph he has found—Louise's college friend, Ted, is the man to whom David gave the shoe. He has also found a receipt for a new set of shoes, bought by Louise shortly before Ted's visit. David accuses Louise of giving him false hope, and, in response to her exasperation, says that it was never about the shoe. David is in grief, having never recovered from the death of Sally's twin brother, Joseph, six years earlier. Like the shoes, the children were \"Two halves ... and one of them's gone\", though he believes that \"they should be together\". Louise finds blood on David's hands, but it is not his own. He had driven to Norfolk to retrieve the shoe from Ted, but does not remember what he has done. The emergency services arrive outside.\n\nOn a cabinet is a photograph of a smiling David holding two infants. He is wearing the shoes. Over the credits, security footage from 15 March 2016 shows David placing the shoe outside his house before jogging away.\n\n\"Diddle Diddle Dumpling\", with David's obsessive search for the shoe's owner, offered a \"macabre reimagining\" of \"Cinderella\" for Sean O'Grady of \"The Independent\". The journalist Andrew Billen, on the other hand, said that the episode did not present the shoe as an allusion to \"Cinderella\" or so that viewers might wait to hear \"the other shoe drop\". Instead, the shoe is presented as \"lonesome aberration\", and, on at least one occasion, is actively anthropomorphised by David. The comedy critic Bruce Dessau identified \"stories of men who marry their VW Golfs or women who fancy the Eiffel Tower\" as something he initially thought an inspiration, and noted \"The Good Life\" as a potential influence for David and Louise's lifestyle. However, the episode diverged strongly from what he had expected, as David's obsession did not involve romantic love, and the episode as a whole was low on humour. \"Diddle Diddle Dumpling\" is a relatively simple episode, described by one critic as \"really just a quiet character study of a man losing his grip\".\n\nThe episode uses Vivaldi's \"The Four Seasons\" to mark the passage of time, which is also portrayed by changing colour palettes. The score and setting convey David's emotional and mental fragility, with a contrast drawn between the chaotic music and controlled cinematography. The seasons, too, convey David's mental state: first the decline, then the \"autumnal calm\", then the collapse.\n\nThe episode's closing scene is, according to several critics, ambiguous, as it is unclear whether David has visited violence on Ted or on Sally. Similarly, the nature of Louise's relationships with both Ted and Chris is open to interpretation: one critic noted the \"little moment\" of Louise's interaction with Chris, and questioned whether David might believe Louise to be having an affair with Ted.\n\nThe family's home has a \"sterile\" feeling, and features a large number of objects in symmetrical pairs. This \"mise-en-scène\" reflects \"David's psychosis, and what he and Louise [have] lost in the death of Sally's twin brother\". Relatedly, shots of unoccupied rooms create a sense of emptiness, while the final shot of Ted shows him as a \"half person\". Critics identified the direction as Hitchcockian, while Tandy characterised it as Bergmanesque.\n\nThe \"number 9\" of \"Diddle Diddle Dumpling\" was not the family home, but the shoe, which was size 9. Despite taking place in a small number of rooms or just outside, the episode does not have the feeling of claustrophobia that is present in some other episodes. \"Diddle Diddle Dumpling\" represented a sharp change of tone from the previous episode of \"Inside No. 9\", \"Empty Orchestra\". For Mark Butler of \"i\", the episode's melancholic mood, uneasy domestic setting, and allusions to mental illness link it to \"Tom & Gerri\", an episode from \"Inside No. 9\" first series.\n\n\"Diddle Diddle Dumpling\" was very well received by critics, some of whom characterised it as an improvement on the weaker \"Empty Orchestra\". Dessau identified it as a \"terrific instalment\", while O'Grady discussed it as a key example of how high-quality television continues to survive in the 21st century, as part of \"a renaissance in British comedy\". It was, for him, comparable with the best of Shearsmith and Pemberton's previous work; Billen, similarly, characterised it as one of the best episodes of \"Inside No. 9\". For the freelance critic Dan Owen, \"Diddle Diddle Dumpling\" was a \"characteristically rich and rewarding experience\", for Patrick Smith of the \"Daily Telegraph\", it was a \"delicious slice of macabre humour\", and for Hannah J Davies, of TheGuardian.com, it was \"excellent\", even if \"not the strongest episode of the series\". Mark Butler, of inews.co.uk, said that the episode \"managed to weave a genuinely gripping and powerful half hour of TV from a seemingly bizarre and banal set-up: a testament to [\"Inside No. 9\"] ongoing mastery of mood\".\n\nJulie McDowall, of \"The National\", called it \"a brilliantly slow, creeping and sinister episode\". Similarly, Victoria Segal and Helen Stewart of \"The Sunday Times\" praised the way that the episode \"builds up an atmosphere of creeping dread\", but were critical of the \"slightly tasteless conclusion\" to which the episode \"dribbles\". In the sister paper \"The Times\", however, Billen praised the conclusion, saying it \"brought with it a tide of distress\"; on the website of \"The Times\", Hugo Rifkind characterised the ending as somewhat anticlimatic, suggesting that the best mysteries are never solved. Also writing for \"The Times\", Chris Bennion praised the \"near genius\" premise, calling the episode a \"witty glimpse of midlife inadequacy\" that became darker as it progressed. Butler identified the device of the shifting seasons as \"a clever and striking touch\", characterising the episode as moving from \"laugh out loud\" humour to \"profoundly uncomfortable\" interactions, with a \"hard to swallow\" and \"disquieting\" conclusion.\n\nMorales's direction received high praise, as did the performances of Hawes, Baynton, and especially Shearsmith. Bennion, though, suggested that Hawes and Baynton were \"somewhat underused\".\n\n"}

He is a brilliant (though insane) character born with dwarfism, portrayed by character actor Michael Dunn. As a mad scientist, Dr. Loveless conceived numerous plots which were always foiled by Secret Service agents James West and Artemus Gordon; the first two episodes showed him being caught and going to jail, although after the third episode he always escaped capture. \n\nLoveless' family had received a valuable land grant in California from the Spanish Viceroy of Mexico. Their land was taken back by the Spanish Crown; and then irretrievably lost however, when California became part of the United States. His original goal was to recover his family's property and create a haven where the disadvantaged (presumably financially and, like himself, physically) could live without torment from society. As the series progressed, however, he became more and more megalomaniacal. West is able to defeat Loveless by using Loveless own ego against him. In \"The Night of the Bogus Bandits\", it is revealed that Loveless' greatest fear is not death, but the fact that once deceased, he cannot continue his plans of revenge against a society which he hates so much.\n\nLoveless was known as a technological genius, producing gadgets far ahead of his time-which his enemy James West acknowledges {\"The Night Dr. Loveless Died\"}. Dr. Loveless is addicted to the very rare Napoleon Brandy Le Grande {\"The Night of Miguelito's Revenge\"}. In the series' first season, his inventions were more practical, anticipating the cathode-ray tube, the airplane, penicllin; automobile (\"The Night the Wizard shook the Earth\"] and a synthesized LSD-like hallucinogen. In the second season, the inventions became more fantastic and included a powder that shrank Jim West to one-twelfth his original size and a device that allowed people to enter paintings. Perhaps the most phantasmagorical of his methods for avoiding capture was when he and his lovely assistant Antoinette (Phoebe Dorin) escaped West and Gordon by shrinking themselves and flying away on the back of a swan. {\"The Night of the Raven\"}. In the last episode which he appeared, Dr Loveless escaped by using a circus cannon to shoot him into space; the only trace of him is his circus ringmasters uniform on the ground along with a recording promising West that they will meet again. {\"The Night of Miguelito's Revenge\"]\n\nAccording to the 1979 TV movie \"The Wild Wild West Revisited\", in 1880, Loveless eventually died of ulcers resulting from anger and frustration at having his plans consistently ruined by West and Gordon. (Michael Dunn died in 1973.) As a result, Loveless' son Michelito (played by Paul Williams) subsequently seeks revenge on the agents.\n\nLoveless was created by writer John Kneubuhl after he read a magazine article about Dunn. The character was introduced in the 1965 episode \"The Night the Wizard Shook The Earth,\" which was the show's third televised episode (although it was produced sixth). Loveless became an immediate hit and Dunn appeared in ten episodes over four seasons, Kneubuhl writing five of them.\n\nDr. Loveless initially had two companions: the hulking Voltaire (played by real-life giant Richard Kiel) and the beautiful songstress Antoinette (portrayed by Dunn's nightclub-act singing partner Phoebe Dorin). Voltaire disappeared after the doctor's third encounter with the agents; Antoinette, after the sixth. However, they each left such an indelible impression on fans that the 1990 comic book miniseries from Millennium Publications, a sequel to rather than an adaptation of the TV program scripted by Mark Ellis with art by Darryl Banks, included both characters.\n\nLoveless was adapted for the 1999 feature film \"Wild Wild West\" as Dr. Arliss Loveless, played by Kenneth Branagh. Branagh's version was a former Confederate military engineer who had lost most of his lower body in an accidental explosion. As a double amputee he used a steam-powered wheelchair and similar innovative contraptions. Loveless was incensed at the South's surrender and sought to dismember the United States and distribute its territory amongst the Native American tribes and its original European colonizers (while keeping the Northern Plains for himself). He also has a personal history with Jim West; an early tank he designed massacred the population of a freed slave colony, including West's parents (in the film, West, portrayed by Will Smith, is African-American).\n"}
{"id": "313009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=313009", "title": "Drug overdose", "text": "Drug overdose\n\nA drug overdose (or simply overdose or OD) is the ingestion or application of a drug or other substance in quantities greater than are recommended or generally practiced. An overdose may result in a toxic state or death.\n\nThe word \"overdose\" implies that there is a common safe dosage and usage for the drug; therefore, the term is commonly only applied to drugs, not poisons, even though poisons are harmless at a low enough dosage. Drug overdoses are sometimes caused intentionally to commit suicide, parasuicide or as self-harm, but many drug overdoses are accidental, the result of intentional or unintentional misuse of medication. Intentional misuse leading to overdose can include using prescribed or unprescribed drugs in excessive quantities in an attempt to produce euphoria.\n\nUsage of illicit drugs of unexpected purity, in large quantities, or after a period of drug abstinence can also induce overdose. Cocaine users who inject intravenously can easily overdose accidentally, as the margin between a pleasurable drug sensation and an overdose is small. Unintentional misuse can include errors in dosage caused by failure to read or understand product labels. Accidental overdoses may also be the result of over-prescription, failure to recognize a drug's active ingredient, or unwitting ingestion by children. A common unintentional overdose in young children involves multi-vitamins containing iron. Iron is a component of the hemoglobin molecule in blood, used to transport oxygen to living cells. When taken in small amounts, iron allows the body to replenish hemoglobin, but in large amounts it causes severe pH imbalances in the body. If this overdose is not treated with chelation therapy, it can lead to death or a permanent coma. The term 'overdose' is often misused as a descriptor for adverse drug reactions or negative drug interactions due to mixing multiple drugs simultaneously.\n\nSigns and symptoms of an overdose vary depending on the drug or exposure to toxins. The symptoms can often be divided into differing toxidromes. This can help one determine what class of drug or toxin is causing the difficulties.\n\nSymptoms of opioid overdoses include slow breathing, heart rate and pulse. Opioid overdoses can also cause pinpoint pupils, and blue lips and nails due to low levels of oxygen in the blood. A person experiencing an opioid overdose might also have muscle spasms, seizures and decreased consciousness. A person experiencing an opiate overdose usually will not wake up even if their name is called or if they are shaken vigorously.\n\nThe drugs or toxins that are most frequently involved in overdose and death (grouped by ICD-10):\n\nThe substance that has been taken may often be determined by asking the person. However, if they will not, or cannot, due to an altered level of consciousness, provide this information, a search of the home or questioning of friends and family may be helpful.\n\nExamination for toxidromes, drug testing, or laboratory test may be helpful. Other laboratory test such as glucose, urea and electrolytes, paracetamol levels and salicylate levels are typically done. Negative drug-drug interactions have sometimes been misdiagnosed as an acute drug overdose, occasionally leading to the assumption of suicide.\n\nThe distribution of naloxone to injection drug users and other opioid drug users decreases the risk of death from overdose. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that U.S. programs for drug users and their caregivers prescribing take-home doses of naloxone and training on its utilization are estimated to have prevented 10,000 opioid overdose deaths. Healthcare institution-based naloxone prescription programs have also helped reduce rates of opioid overdose in the U.S. state of North Carolina, and have been replicated in the U.S. military. Nevertheless, scale-up of healthcare-based opioid overdose interventions is limited by providers' insufficient knowledge and negative attitudes towards prescribing take-home naloxone to prevent opioid overdose. Programs training police and fire personnel in opioid overdose response using naloxone have also shown promise in the US.\n\nStabilization of the victim's airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs) is the initial treatment of an overdose. Ventilation is considered when there is a low respiratory rate or when blood gases show the person to be hypoxic. Monitoring of the patient should continue before and throughout the treatment process, with particular attention to temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, blood pressure, urine output, electrocardiography (ECG) and O saturation. Poison control centers and medical toxicologists are available in many areas to provide guidance in overdoses to both physicians and the general public.\n\nSpecific antidotes are available for certain overdoses. For example, naloxone is the antidote for opiates such as heroin or morphine. Similarly, benzodiazepine overdoses may be effectively reversed with flumazenil. As a nonspecific antidote, activated charcoal is frequently recommended if available within one hour of the ingestion and the ingestion is significant. Gastric lavage, syrup of ipecac, and whole bowel irrigation are rarely used.\n\nIn the United States, more than 72,000 people died from drug overdoses in 2017, which was an increase of about 10 percent over 2016. Since 2000, the US drug overdose death rate has gone from 6.2 per 100,000 people in 2000 to 14.7 per 100,000 in 2014.\n\nThe National Center for Health Statistics report that 19,250 people died of accidental poisoning in the U.S. in the year 2004 (8 deaths per 100,000 population).\n\nIn 2008 testimony before a Senate subcommittee, Leonard J. Paulozzi, a medical epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stated that in 2005 more than 22,000 American lives were lost due to overdoses, and the number is growing rapidly. Paulozzi also testified that all available evidence suggests that unintentional overdose deaths are related to the increasing use of prescription drugs, especially opioid painkillers. However, the vast majority of overdoses are also attributable to alcohol. It is very rare for a victim of an overdose to have consumed just one drug. Most overdoses occur when drugs are ingested in combination with alcohol.\n\nDrug overdose was the leading cause of injury death in 2013. Among people 25 to 64 years old, drug overdose caused more deaths than motor vehicle traffic crashes. There were 43,982 drug overdose deaths in the United States in 2013. Of these, 22,767 (51.8%) were related to prescription drugs.\n\nThe 22,767 deaths relating to prescription drug overdose in 2013, 16,235 (71.3%) involved opioid painkillers, and 6,973 (30.6%) involved benzodiazepines. Drug misuse and abuse caused about 2.5 million emergency department (ED) visits in 2011. Of these, more than 1.4 million ED visits were related to prescription drugs. Among those ED visits, 501,207 visits were related to anti-anxiety and insomnia medications, and 420,040 visits were related to opioid analgesics.\n\n"}
{"id": "378783", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=378783", "title": "Ectotherm", "text": "Ectotherm\n\nAn ectotherm (from the Greek ἐκτός (\"ektós\") \"outside\" and θερμός (\"thermós\") \"hot\"), is an organism in which internal physiological sources of heat are of relatively small or quite negligible importance in controlling body temperature. Such organisms (for example frogs) rely on environmental heat sources, which permit them to operate at very economical metabolic rates. Colloquially, some refer to these organisms as \"cold blooded\" though such a term is not technically correct, as the blood temperature of the organism varies with ambient environmental temperature. Some of these animals live in environments where temperatures are practically constant, as is typical of regions of the abyssal ocean and hence can be regarded as homeothermic ectotherms. In contrast, in places where temperature varies so widely as to limit the physiological activities of other kinds of ectotherms, many species habitually seek out external sources of heat or shelter from heat; for example, many reptiles regulate their body temperature by basking in the sun, or seeking shade when necessary in addition to a whole host of other behavioral thermoregulation mechanisms.\nFor home captivity as pet, reptile owners can use a UVB/UVA light system to assist the animals' basking behaviour.\n\nIn contrast to ectotherms, endotherms rely largely, even predominantly, on heat from internal metabolic processes, and mesotherms use an intermediate strategy.\n\nIn ectotherms, fluctuating ambient temperatures may affect the body temperature. Such variation in body temperature is called poikilothermy, though the concept is not widely satisfactory and the use of the term is declining. In small aquatic creatures such as Rotifera, the poikilothermy is practically absolute, but other creatures (like crabs) have wider physiological options at their disposal, and they can move to preferred temperatures, avoid ambient temperature changes, or moderate their effects. Ectotherms can also display the features of homeothermy, especially within aquatic organisms. Normally their range of ambient environmental temperatures is relatively constant, and there are few in number that attempt to maintain a higher internal temperature due to the high associated costs.\n\nVarious patterns of behavior enable certain ectotherms to regulate body temperature to a useful extent. To warm up, reptiles and many insects find sunny places and adopt positions that maximise their exposure; at harmfully high temperatures they seek shade or cooler water. In cold weather, honey bees huddle together to retain heat. Butterflies and moths may orient their wings to maximize exposure to solar radiation in order to build up heat before take-off. Gregarious caterpillars, such as the Forest Tent caterpillar and fall webworm, benefit from basking in large groups for thermoregulation. Many flying insects, such as honey bees and bumble bees, also raise their internal temperatures endothermally prior to flight, by vibrating their flight muscles without violent movement of the wings (see insect thermoregulation). Such endothermal activity is an example of the difficulty of consistent application of terms such as poikilothermy and homiothermy.\n\nIn addition to behavioral adaptations, physiological adaptations help ectotherms regulate temperature. Diving reptiles conserve heat by heat exchange mechanisms, whereby cold blood from the skin picks up heat from blood moving outward from the body core, re-using and thereby conserving some of the heat that otherwise would have been wasted. The skin of bullfrogs secretes more mucus when it is hot, allowing more cooling by evaporation.\n\nDuring periods of cold, some ectotherms enter a state of torpor, in which their metabolism slows or, in some cases, such as the wood frog, effectively stops. The torpor might last overnight or last for a season, or even for years, depending on the species and circumstances.\n\nEctotherms rely largely on external heat sources such as sunlight to achieve their optimal body temperature for various bodily activities. Accordingly, they depend on ambient conditions to reach operational body temperatures. In contrast, endothermic animals, as a rule, maintain nearly constant high operational body temperatures largely by reliance on internal heat produced by metabolically active organs (liver, kidney, heart, brain, muscle) or even by specialized heat producing organs like brown adipose tissue (BAT). Also, as a rule, ectotherms have lower metabolic rates than endotherms at a given body mass. As a consequence, endotherms generally rely on higher food consumption, and commonly on food of higher energy content. Such requirements may limit the carrying capacity of a given environment for endotherms as compared to its carrying capacity for ectotherms.\n\nBecause ectotherms depend on environmental conditions for body temperature regulation, as a rule, they are more sluggish at night and in early mornings. When they emerge from shelter, many diurnal ectotherms need to heat up in the early sunlight before they can begin their daily activities. In cool weather the foraging activity of such species is therefore restricted to the day time in most vertebrate ectotherms, and in cold climates most cannot survive at all. In lizards, for instance, most nocturnal species are geckos specialising in \"sit and wait\" foraging strategies. Such strategies do not require as much energy as active foraging and do not, as a rule, require hunting activity of the same intensity. From another point of view, sit-and-wait predation may require very long periods of unproductive waiting. Endotherms cannot, in general, afford such long periods without food, but suitably adapted ectotherms can wait without expending much energy. Endothermic vertebrate species are therefore less dependent on the environmental conditions and have developed a higher variability (both within and between species) in their daily patterns of activity.\n\nPossible confusion can arise from the difference in the terminology of physics and biology. Whereas the thermodynamic terms \"exothermic\" and \"endothermic\" respectively refer to processes that give out heat energy and processes that absorb heat energy, in biology the sense is effectively inverted. The metabolic term \"ectotherm\" refers to organisms that rely largely on external heat to achieve a full working temperature, and \"endotherm\" refers to organisms that produce heat from within as a major factor in controlling their bodily temperature.\n\nNotes\n"}

His father, whose name was Elt, was a schoolmaster in the neighbourhood of Tottenham Court Road, and got up plays among his scholars. In these, at the Sans Souci Theatre in Leicester Place, and subsequently at Pym's private theatre, Wilson Street, Gray's Inn Lane, Elton acted, as a youth.\n\nAfter joining a strolling company, he appeared, in 1823, as utility actor at the Olympic, playing in \"A Fish out of Water,\" where he made the acquaintance of Tyrone Power. At Christmas he went to the Liverpool Amphitheatre, where the following year, after a summer engagement at Birmingham, under Alfred Bunn, he played Napoleon in the spectacle of the \"Battle of Waterloo\". He then, at the Theatre Royal, Liverpool, played Cominius in \"Coriolanus\". After starring in Chester, Worcester, Shrewsbury, and elsewhere, he attracted in Manchester the favourable notice of Charles Young, with whom he appeared in Norwich and Cambridge.\n\nHis efforts in Shakespearean parts were not very successful. With a fair country reputation, however, he came in 1831 to the Garrick Theatre in Whitechapel, opening under Conquest and Wynn in \"Richard III\". Great popularity attended him at the East End.\n\nIn October 1832 he was at the Strand Theatre, whence he went to the Surrey. An unsuccessful engagement at the Haymarket, under Morris, in 1833 came to a speedy termination. He then returned to the minor theatres, was in the spring of 1836 at the Adelphi, and 10 January 1837 at Covent Garden, under Osbaldiston's management, made a success as the eponymous \"Walter Tyrrell\".\n\nOn the production, 26 June 1837, at the Haymarket of \"The Bridal\" adapted by Sheridan Knowles from the \"Maid's Tragedy\" of Beaumont and Fletcher, he gained much credit as Amintor. He was then engaged for Covent Garden, at which house he was the original Beauséant in \"The Lady of Lyons\". At Drury Lane, 1839–40, he played Romeo and Rolls, and was the original Rizzio in Haynes's \"Mary Stuart\". He then retired to the minor theatres, and in 1841-2 returned with Macready to Drury Lane. The theatre closed 14 June 1843. Before the termination of the season he accepted an engagement of a month from William H. Murray of the Theatre Royal, Edinburgh.\n\nIn addition to the characters mentioned above, Elton was good as Edgar in \"King Lear\". He was the original Eugene Aram, Thierry, and Waller in the \"Love Chase\" of Sheridan Knowles.\n\nElton contributed to periodical literature, and gave lectures on drama at the National Hall, Holborn. He was one of the original promoters of the General Theatrical Fund Association.\n\nIn 1843, at the end of his months engagement in Edinburgh, he boarded the \"Pegasus\" for London and was drowned when the ship struck rocks near Holy Island and went down. A strong sensation was caused by his death, and benefits for his children, to which liberal subscriptions were sent, took place at many theatres. The chair at a preliminary meeting in London for the purpose was taken by Charles Dickens.\n\nElton was unfortunate in marriage, having been separated from his first wife, and the second wife, a Miss Pratt, the mother of five of his seven children, going mad.\n\n"}

Each species has points that players can spend on adapting or evolving their creature populations, which are represented by animated icons of that creature. The more points a player spends on a field for a species, the quicker it evolves, becomes better at feeding (and growing in number faster), or better at fighting off predators. When a player evolves a creature, one can pick a population to be upgraded to the evolution one chooses. Each creature has a different set of evolution paths, and some can evolve into six or more different creatures. The world grows as the game advances, with land masses drifting and terrain shifting. As the player evolves the selected creatures, the player slowly advances in the complexity of the animals, eventually reaching intelligent life. Usually, the first player to do this is the victor (standard rules).\n\nThe game starts from basal tetrapods, the very first land dwellers: amphibians. At the gain of the game, each player starts with one population of a species of prehistoric amphibian—e.g. \"Ichthyostega\", \"Tulerpeton\", and \"Acanthostega\". Gradually, if the player monitors the species' progress and moves them to more appropriate habitats and climate zones, the selected species will feed, breed, and prosper. From that secure population who can then evolve more advanced and adaptable creatures, along with continental drift and climate change, the other, older, and more primitive species will be rendered obsolete, and their creatures will die out.\n\nAs the player advances their creatures, extinctions may wipe out populations of some species, while others may not be affected at all. Each species has a drop-down menu, which displays all the more advanced creatures that this particular species can evolve into. Eventually, when the player reaches intelligent and advanced animals, the menu will display certain creatures that can then evolve into the standard intelligent life of civilization builders. The line of intelligent species doesn't have to be humans (e.g. \"Australopithecus\", \"Homo habilis\", \"Homo sapiens\"). The player can also evolve other intelligent species who are fictional or highly speculative. For example, if a player evolves one of the creatures into an elephant, one can access the elephant line, and gradually evolve that elephant into \"Elephantosapiens\" which is a species of intelligent life, thus winning the game. \"Elephantosapiens\" of course, is fictional and speculative. Other species of intelligent life within the game are parrot men, wombat men, and dino men.\n\nOnce a player evolves intelligent life, the game ends and scores are added up and displayed, although the player who evolved intelligent life is guaranteed victory. Score points are given to players who make evolutionary breakthroughs. For example, evolving the first reptile, mammal, or dinosaur is worth bonus points.\n\nThe game can either be played alone or against the computer. With opponents, the game has another side to it. Each animal has the ability to evolve defense, and other animals (predatory creatures) controlled by the players, can fight one another's creatures, thus wiping out an enemy population, reducing competition and weakening the opponent. To fend off these attacks, the other player can, as said earlier, evolve defenses against the opponent's predators.\n\n\"Inside Games\" thought it was a perfect simulation. \"Electric Play\" felt the game was both educational and interesting. \"Happy Puppy\" thought the game had lots of replay value.\n\n\n"}

IL8RB is also known as CXCR2, and CXCR2 is now the IUPHAR Committee on Receptor Nomenclature and Drug classification-recommended name.\n\nThe protein encoded by this gene is a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor family. This protein is a receptor for interleukin 8 (IL8). It binds to IL8 with high affinity, and transduces the signal through a G-protein-activated second messenger system (G-coupled). This receptor also binds to chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1/MGSA), a protein with melanoma growth stimulating activity, and has been shown to be a major component required for serum-dependent melanoma cell growth. In addition, it binds ligands CXCL2, CXCL3, and CXCL5.\n\nThe angiogenic effects of IL8 in intestinal microvascular endothelial cells are found to be mediated by this receptor. Knockout studies in mice suggested that this receptor controls the positioning of oligodendrocyte precursors in developing spinal cord by arresting their migration.

His name was acquired prior to his acceptance of Islam and is considered unusual and incomplete. In the Arabic language \"Julaybib\" means \"small grown\" being the diminutive form of the word \"jalbab\", indicating that Julaybib was small and short, even dwarf-like. He was also described as being \"damim\", meaning ugly, deformed, or repulsive.\n\nJulaybib's lineage was unknown and there is no record of his parents or what tribe he belonged to. All that was known of him was that he was an Arab and that he was one of the Ansar in Medina.\n\nWith Julaybib in mind, Muhammad went to an Ansari man and said: \"I want to have your daughter married.\" \"How wonderful and blessed, O Messenger of God and what a delight to the eye (this would be),\" he replied. \"I do not want her for myself,\" added Muhammad. \"Then for whom, O Messenger of God?\" asked the man, obviously disappointed. \"For Julaybib,\" said Muhammad. The Ansari went to consult with his wife, telling her of Muhammad's desire for their daughter to marry Julaybib. His wife was repulsed, and protested saying \"To Julaybib! No, never to Julaybib! No, by God, we shall not marry (her) to him.\"\n\nWhile the Ansari was preparing to inform Muhammad of what his wife said, the daughter hearing her mother's protestations, asked: \"Who has asked you to marry me?\"\n\nIt is said that she the daughter was so beautiful that there was none among the women of that clan who could compete with her looks. She was so shy and modest that perhaps the sky itself had never seen her head uncovered. She had so much fear of her creator and piety, that she would spend her days and nights in worship.The daughter asked what was happening, she was told that the Messenger of God wants your hand in marriage for Julaybib. As the Mother continued her crying and wailing the daughter spoke she said, \"O my Mother fear Allah think of what you are saying are you turning away the Messenger of God. 'O my Mother it does not suit a believer to make their own decision once God and his Messenger have decided on a matter. Do you think that the Messenger of God will disgrace us? How blessed is the status of Julaybib, that God and his Messenger are asking for your daughter's hand on his behalf. Don't you know that the angels themselves envy the dust on the feet of one who is a beloved of God and His Messenger. Ask the Messenger to send me Julaybib for there is no greater privilege than for me to be blessed by such a husband, the Messenger of God has arrived with such a wonderful gift yet my Mother you cry and wail.\"\n\nShe was married by Muhammad to Julaybib and they lived together until he was martyred in an expedition.\n\nOn the day of the expedition his father in law, had pleaded with him: \"'O Julaybib this is just an expedition, it is not a compulsory Jihad, it is a voluntary Jihad, therefore you are newly married spend some time with your wife.\"\n\nJulaybib, the one who had spent a lifetime in despair, had now found a loving wife. But he replied to his father in law's request and said, \" 'O my father you say a strange thing, my Beloved Prophet is in the battlefield facing the enemies of Islam and you want me to sit at home with my wife, nay I will sacrifice my blood and my soul rather than see my Prophet facing hardship while I sit at home in luxury\".\n\nJulaybib participated in an expedition with Muhammad in which an encounter with some enemies ensued.\n\nAfter that battle the Prophet of God, asked his companions to go and to see if anyone was missing from their family's and clans. Each one returned accounting for all his family members. Then the Prophet spoke with tears in his eyes he said \"But I have lost my Beloved Julaybib, go and find him.\" They found his diminutive body lying next to seven enemies he had slain in the battle.\n\nThe Prophet of God asked for a grave to be dug, as the Prophet of God held the body of Julaybib he said. \"O' Allah he is from me and I am From Him\", he repeated this three times. The companions wept profusely \"May our Mothers and Fathers be sacrificed for you O' Julaybib, how great is your status.\" Thus a companion who had once lived as an outcast, shunned by the society around him. He loved God and his Messenger and reached such a high status. He who was not good looking was blessed with a beautiful wife, he who was poor was blessed by a wealthy wife, he who had no family or status, was blessed by a wife with noble status and lineage he who had lived in loneliness and despair, was loved by Allah and his messenger, He had the Messenger of God say: \" O Allah he is from me and I am from him.\"\n\nIt is said: \"That upon his martyrdom, that the sky itself was filled with thousands of angels who had come to participate in his funeral.\"\n\nJulaybib 'The Lonesome one' had become a beloved of Allah, and his prophet, he was lonely no more. Such is the status of the lovers of the Prophet.\n\nAs for his wife it is said that there was no widow whose hand was more sought after in marriage than hers.\n\nMusnad Ahmad, Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal\n\n"}

He was Speaker of the House of Representatives of Thailand 1973-1974. He was the thirteenth Prime Minister of Thailand, serving in office from 1975 to 1976 between Seni Pramoj, his brother's, terms. Being the great-grandson of King Rama II, he was a member of the Thai royal family.\nHe also portrayed the Prime Minister of the fictional country of \"Sarkhan\" in the 1963 motion picture \"The Ugly American\" with Marlon Brando.\n\nHe was born on 20 April 1911 at Sing Buri Province into an cadet branch of Chakri Dynasty with Chinese ancestry. The son of Brigadier General Prince Khamrob and his wife Daeng (Bunnag), his older brother was M.R. Seni Pramoj while his great-grandmother, Ampha, was of Chinese descent and was a consort of Rama II. He served as a corporal during the Franco-Thai War in 1940. Like many upper class Thais of his generation, his parents sent him and his siblings to boarding schools in England including Trent College. He finished his bachelor's degree in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics (PPE) from Queen's College, University of Oxford.\n\nUpon returning to Thailand, his first job was in the field of banking; but his true vocation was his mastery of many forms of arts, including politics and journalism. Put off by Hollywood's portrayal of revered nineteenth-century king, Mongkut, in the 1946 film \"Anna and the King of Siam\", based on the semi-fictional biographical novel of the same name, Kukrit and his brother, Seni Pramoj, wrote \"The King of Siam speaks\" in 1948. They sent their manuscript to the American politician and diplomat Abbot Low Moffat who drew on it for his biography entitled \"Mongkut the King of Siam\" (), and in 1961, donated the Pramoj manuscript to the Southeast Asian Collection, Asian Division, Library of Congress. He wrote for \"Siam Rath\" ( \"Siam Kingdom\"), the newspaper that he founded.\n\nAs a means of showing how Thai society adjusted to life in modern society, in 1953 Kukrit began a series of stories on the life and times of fictional Mae Ploy (). who as a young girl enters the service of a princess of Rama V's Royal Household, and dies the same day as Rama VIII. This story was to be one of many that were published in the Kukrit's Siam Rat. His satirical sense and unique sense of humour offered an incisive view of the times Kukrit chronicled.. As a scholar, he also wrote many non-fiction works ranging from history and religion to astrology. Most notable are his epics and many short stories portraying various aspects of life and documenting contemporary history. His \"Many Lives\" (, \"Lai Chiwit\") was also translated into English. He was a leading authority on traditional Thai culture and had a polymathic range of interests from Thailand's classical dance to literature. Most famous for his literary works, he was named a National Artist of Thailand for literature in 1985, the inaugural year for the honour. And he received The Special Commemorative Prize of The Fukuoka Asian Culture Prizes in 1990, the inaugural year for the prizes again. His works encompass many subjects from humour to drama. He was also known as a staunch loyalist and served the monarchy for his entire life. He is considered one of the great statesmen of Thailand. His former home is now a heritage museum which is preserved; paying homage to his life and Thai traditions.\n\nHe was married to M.R. Pakpring Thongyai with whom he had two children, a son and daughter. He died on 9 October 1995.\n\n\nWhen George Englund decided to use Thailand as the location for the fictional country portrayed in his film \"The Ugly American\", Kukrit was appointed as cultural advisor to make sure the film accurately portrayed monarchy in a Buddhist country. Englund had difficulty casting the part of the fictional Prime Minister, but he was so impressed by Kukrit's cultural refinement and mastery of English that he offered him the part, saying, \"I can't think of anyone who could play it better.\" Kukrit accepted, saying, according to Englund, \"We are all actors anyway, and I think you're right that I could play it better than anyone.\" Probably because of this, after he became a real-life Prime Minister of Thailand in 1975, the word \"Sarkhan\" has entered the Thai language as a nickname of Thailand itself, often with a slight self-depreciating or mocking tone.\n\nThe home that M.R. Kukrit built for himself in Bangkok has been registered by the Department of Fine Arts as 'Home of an Important Person'. It is open to the public on Saturdays, Sundays and official Thai holidays between 10am and 5pm. Standing in of land, surrounded by landscaped gardens, the house is a similar concept to the Jim Thompson House in Bangkok. Five small traditional Thai houses were dismantled and reassembled at the present site to make one house. The house is filled with artefacts and books collected by the owner. Additions to the original house include air conditioning, a modern bathroom, and a lift was installed when the owner became too frail to climb up and down stairs. The M.R. Kukrit Heritage Home is situated at 19 Soi Phra Pinit, South Sathorn Road, Sathon District, Bangkok 10120. Tel. +66 (0)2 286 8185. The nearest BTS Skytrain station is Chong Nonsi. English speaking guides are available to show visitors around. Photography is not allowed inside the house. The entrance fee is Bt50 for adults and Bt20 for children and students.\n\nKukrit Pramoj is perhaps best known in Thailand for his literary production, particularly his novel \"Four Reigns\", which was published as a serial in his newspaper \"Siam Rat\" in 1950. \"Four Reigns\" tells the story of \"Mae Ploi,\" a young girl who grew up in the court of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) where she was an attendant to one of the princesses. Kukrit extends her story after her marriage during the reign of Rama VI, and in the process tells the story of mid-twentieth century Thailand through Mae Ploi's eyes. The story includes the reigns of four Kings of the Chakri dynasty (thus the title \"Four Reigns\"), and the 1932 Revolution against the absolute monarchy. \"Four Reigns\" was translated into English by Tulachandra. The Thai version of \"Four Reigns\" continues to be well-known to Thais in the twenty-first century because it has been used in Thai schools, and has been produced as a well-known films.\n\nOnly two other of Kukrit's many novels, \"Many Lives\", and \"Red Bamboo\" are translated into English. In addition, there is a compilation of Kukrit's English language writings and interviews, \"M. R. Kukrit Pramoj, His Wit and Wisdom\", compiled by Vilas Manivat, and edited by Steve Van Beek. However, Kukrit's writings in the Thai language are voluminous, and include both fiction and non-fiction. Much of Kukrit's writing was first published as either columns or serials in the \"Siam Rat\". The installments of Four Reigns. A number of the books serialized and later turned into books. A wide range of subjects were addressed in these books, including contemporary politics, Kukrit's love of dogs, Thai history, Southeast Asian history, elephants, a history of the Jews, and many other subjects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\n"}

However, a few scientists have speculated that thermoacidophilic extremophile microorganisms might exist in the lower-temperature, acidic upper layers of the Venusian atmosphere.\n\nUntil the mid 20th century, the surface environment of Venus was believed to be similar to Earth, and hence it was widely believed that Venus could harbor life.\nIn 1870, the British astronomer Richard Proctor said the existence of life on Venus was impossible near its equator, but possible near its poles.\n\nSince the 1960s, increasingly clear evidence from various space probes showed Venus has an extreme climate, with a greenhouse effect generating a constant temperature of about 500 °C on the surface. The atmosphere contains sulfuric acid clouds and the atmospheric pressure at the surface is 90 bar, almost 100 times that of Earth and similar to that of more than deep in Earth's oceans. In such environment, and given the increasingly hostile characteristics of the Venusian weather, the chances of life as we know it are excluded from the surface of Venus.\n\nIn September 1967, Carl Sagan and Harold Morowitz published an analysis of the issue of life on Venus to the journal \"Nature\".\n\nAlthough there is little possibility of existing life near the surface of Venus, the altitudes about 50 km above the surface have a mild temperature, and hence there are still some opinions in favor of such a possibility in the atmosphere of Venus.\n\nIn the analysis of mission data from the \"Venera\", Pioneer Venus and \"Magellan\" missions, it was discovered that carbonyl sulfide, hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide were present together in the upper atmosphere. \"Venera\" also detected large amounts of toxic chlorine just below the Venusian cloud cover. Carbonyl sulfide is difficult to produce inorganically, but it can be produced by volcanism. Sulfuric acid is produced in the upper atmosphere by the Sun's photochemical action on carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and water vapour.\n\nSolar radiation constrains the atmospheric habitable zone to between 51 km (65 °C) and 62 km (−20 °C) altitude, within the acidic clouds. It has been speculated that clouds in the atmosphere of Venus could contain chemicals that can initiate forms of biological activity. It has been speculated that any hypothetical microorganisms inhabiting the atmosphere, if present, could employ ultraviolet light (UV) emitted by the Sun as an energy source, which could be an explanation for the dark lines observed in the UV photographs of Venus.\n\nIt is plausible that microbial life originated on Venus if liquid water existed on its surface prior to the heating of the planet by the runaway greenhouse effect, but no longer exists. Assuming the process that delivered water to Earth was common to all the planets near the habitable zone, it has been estimated that liquid water could have existed on its surface for up to 600 million years during and shortly after the Late Heavy Bombardment, which could be enough time for simple life to form, but this figure can vary from as little as a few million years to as much as few billion. This might also have given enough time for microbial life to evolve to be aerial. There has been very little analysis of Venusian surface material, so it is possible that evidence of past life, if it ever existed, could be found with a probe capable of enduring Venus's current extreme surface conditions, although the resurfacing of the planet in the past 500 million years means that it is unlikely that ancient surface rocks remain, especially those containing the mineral tremolite which, theoretically, could have encased some biosignatures.\n\n"}

In a fully enclosing suit where exhaled breathing air can enter the suit, the exhaled air is moist and can lead to an uncomfortable feeling of dampness or wetness.\n\nWhile this technology is most commonly associated with space suits, it is also used in a wide range of Earth-bound applications where open-air cooling is difficult or impossible to achieve, such as fire fighting, working in a steel mill and increasingly by surgeons during long or strenuous procedures.\n\nThere are typically two parts to a liquid cooling garment:\n\nThe garment is typically a close-fitting non-stretching fabric or a tight-fitting elastic fabric, with flexible tubing sewn onto the fabric. A single layer of fabric may be used, with the tubing either on the inside directly contacting the wearer's skin, or on the outside separated by the fabric. If two layers of fabric are used, stitched channels can be formed which enclose the tubing between the two fabric layers. Where flame resistance is needed, the garment may be constructed out of materials such as nomex.\n\nThe tubing is typically a few millimeters in diameter, and may be made out of any number of flexible plastics such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or silicone. Smaller diameter tubing permits a higher degree of garment flexibility, but at a cost of lower heat absorption capacity, and increased pressure needed to push liquid through the tubing.\n\nWhen a large area needs to be cooled or the external environment also heats the tubing, a single long tube may not be enough because the liquid becomes saturated with heat and cannot cool any further. Making the liquid much colder is not an option since it leads to uncomfortable coldness where the liquid enters the tubes. Instead, multiple parallel tubes are used to increase the volume of liquid available to absorb heat.\n\nSkin coverage and tubing density can vary depending on the application. The garment may simply be a short-sleeved shirt, or it may be a full-body suit covering the arms and legs. Where the heat removal requirement is low, the tubing may be spaced several centimeters apart across the garment surface. Where there is a very large amount of heat to remove, the tubing can be arranged in a dense grid with no gaps between the tubes.\n\nFor portable earthbound applications, the heat exchanger for cooling the liquid can be very low-tech, consisting simply of a container for holding ice, and an electric pump to circulate water from the container through the tubing. The return water is cooled by the melting ice and again pumped through the tubes. Regulation of flow is done by varying pump speed or using an adjustable flow valve. Ice storage can be achieved using a belt-pack, a backpack, or a duffel bag, depending on the length of time needed for the cooling system to operate between refilling the ice storage.\n\nIn situations where the wearer must stay in place inside a vehicle, heavy but long-term-operation heat exchangers can be used, such as a refrigeration system to cool the liquid.\n\nWhen the user's movement is partially hindered through the use of a life-support umbilical, cooling liquid can also be supplied via the umbilical.\n\nAstronauts commonly wear a Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment in order to maintain a comfortable core body temperature during extra-vehicular activity (EVA). The LCVG accomplishes this task by circulating cool water through a network of flexible tubes in direct contact with the astronaut's skin. The water draws heat away from the body, resulting in a lower core temperature. The water then returns to the Primary Life Support System (PLSS), where it is cooled in a heat exchanger before being recirculated.\n\nIn an independent space suit, the heat is ultimately transferred to a thin sheet of ice (formed by a separate feed water source). Due to the extremely low pressure in space, the heated ice sublimates directly to water vapor, which is then vented away from the suit.\n\nThe ice sublimator consists of sintered nickel plates with microscopic pores which are sized to permit the water to freeze in the plate without damaging it. So when heat needs to be removed, the ice in the pores melts and the water passes through them to form a thin sheet which sublimates (like dry ice). When there is no heat needing to be removed, this water refreezes sealing the plate. The rate of sublimation of the ice is directly proportional to the amount of heat needing to be removed, so the system is self-regulating needing no moving parts. During EVA on the Moon, it had outlet gas temperature of , As an example, during the Apollo 12 commander's first EVA (of 3 hrs, 44 minutes), of feedwater were sublimated, and this dissipated . The pores eventually get clogged through contamination and the plates need to be replaced.,\n\nIn a dependent space suit (such as the ones used in the Gemini program or within lunar orbit on the Apollo program), the heat is carried back to a host spacecraft through an umbilical connection, where it is ultimately radiated or sublimated via the spacecraft's own thermal control system.\n\nBecause the space environment is essentially a vacuum, heat cannot be lost through heat convection, and can only be directly dissipated through thermal radiation, a much slower process. Thus, even though the environment of space can be extremely cold, excessive heat build-up is inevitable. Without an LCVG, there would be no means by which to expel this heat, and it would affect not only EVA performance, but the health of the suit occupant as well. The LCVG used with the Apollo/Skylab A7L suit could remove heat at a rate of approximately 586 watts.\n\nThe LCVG used with NASA's Extravehicular Mobility Unit is primarily constructed of spandex, with a nylon tricot liner.

Often regarded as one of the best players in the world, Suárez has won 17 trophies in his career, including five league titles and a UEFA Champions League title at club level, and a Copa América with Uruguay. A prolific goalscorer, Suárez has won two European Golden Shoes,\nan Eredivisie Golden Boot, a Premier League Golden Boot, as well as ending the six-year dominance of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo by winning La Liga's Pichichi Trophy in 2016. He has scored over 400 senior career goals for club and country.\n\nSuárez began his career as a youth player for Nacional in 2003. At age 19, he relocated to the Netherlands to play for Groningen, before transferring to Ajax in 2007. He won his first trophy in 2010, the KNVB Cup, finishing the season as the league's top scorer and was named Dutch Footballer of the Year. A year later, he helped Ajax secure the Eredivisie title, and scored his 100th Ajax goal. In January 2011, Suárez transferred to Liverpool, and won the League Cup in his first full season. In 2014, he was named the PFA Players' Player of the Year and the FWA Footballer of the Year as well as winning the Premier League Golden Boot, and sharing the European Golden Shoe with Cristiano Ronaldo before moving to Barcelona in a transfer worth €82.3 million (£64.98 million), making him one of the most expensive players in football history.\n\nIn his first season at Barcelona, Suárez starred in an attacking trio alongside Lionel Messi and Neymar, helping the club win a historic second continental treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League. Messi, Suárez, Neymar (dubbed MSN), scored a total of 122 goals that season, the most for an attacking front three in Spanish football history. In his second season at the club, Suárez won his first Pichichi Trophy as well as his second European Golden Shoe, for which he became the first player since 2009 to win both awards other than Messi or Ronaldo. He ended the season with a total of 40 league goals, 14 of which came in his last five matches, and 16 assists, becoming the first player in history to top La Liga in both goals and assists.\n\nSuárez is Uruguay's all-time leading goalscorer. At the 2010 FIFA World Cup he played an important role in Uruguay's fourth-place finish, scoring three goals, as well as controversially blocking a goal-bound extra time header with his hands during the quarter-final against Ghana. At the 2011 Copa América, Suárez scored four goals as Uruguay won a record fifteenth Copa América, and he was named Player of the Tournament. At the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, Suárez scored his 40th international goal before he was suspended from the tournament after biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini. Suárez has been a source of controversy throughout his career. As well as his goal-line handball, he has also bitten opponents on three separate occasions. He has also been accused of and admitted to diving, and in 2011, the FA found him guilty of racially abusing Patrice Evra, a decision Suárez disputes.\n\nSuárez lived his early years at the Cerro neighbourhood in Salto, where he played youth football at Sportivo Artigas. At age seven, he moved with his family (parents and six brothers) to Montevideo, where he played youth football at Urreta FC.\n\nSuárez joined local side Nacional's youth team at age 14. At age 16, Suárez headbutted a referee following a red card. One night, he was caught drinking and partying, prompting his coach to threaten he would never play unless he started playing football more seriously. In May 2005, at age 18, Suárez made his first-team debut against Junior de Barranquilla in the Copa Libertadores. He scored his first goal in September 2005 and helped Nacional win the 2005–06 Uruguayan league with 10 goals in 27 matches.\n\nSuárez was found by a group of scouts from the Dutch club Groningen when they were in Uruguay to scout another player. As they watched, he won and converted a penalty and scored a \"wonder goal\" against Defensor. After watching only that match, the scouts approached Suárez and said they wanted to buy him, and after the season, Groningen paid Nacional €800,000 for him. Suárez was thrilled to go to Europe because his then girlfriend, and now wife, Sofía Balbi, had moved to Barcelona; they had maintained a long-distance relationship for a year and he wanted to move closer to her.\n\nSuárez was 19 years old when he joined Groningen. Initially, Suárez struggled because he could not speak Dutch or English, and he played on the second team to adjust to the Dutch game. His teammate and fellow Uruguayan, Bruno Silva, helped him settle into living in the Netherlands and playing for a new team. He worked hard to learn Dutch and his teammates respected him for his efforts with the language. Suárez scored goals for Groningen, but he also had disciplinary problems; in one five-game stretch in January 2007, he scored four goals but received three yellow cards and one red card. Suárez especially made his mark in a 4–3 home win over Vitesse, when with ten minutes to go he subsequently won a penalty and scored two goals. Suárez ended with 10 goals in 29 league appearances to help Groningen finish eighth in the 2006–07 Eredivisie. He also scored in a 4–2 loss to Serbian club Partizan in his European debut.\n\nAjax saw potential in Suárez and offered Groningen €3.5 million for him, but Groningen rejected the offer. Suárez was upset and brought his case to the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB)'s arbitration committee to try to facilitate the sale. The arbitration committee ruled against him on 9 August 2007, but that same day, Ajax increased their offer to €7.5 million and Groningen accepted.\n\nSuárez signed a five-year contract with Ajax and made his club debut in the UEFA Champions League qualifier against Slavia Prague. He scored one goal in his Eredivisie debut for the club and two goals in his home debut at the Amsterdam Arena. Ajax finished second in league in the 2007–08 season and Suárez scored 17 goals in 33 league appearances, setting up a blossoming striking partnership with league top scorer Klaas-Jan Huntelaar.\n\nDuring the 2008–09 season, Ajax head coach Marco van Basten noted how Suárez played an important role in many of Ajax's goals, but Van Basten was also upset by the number of yellow cards Suárez received. Suárez was suspended for one match because he was given his seventh yellow card of the season against Utrecht in a 2–0 win. He was also suspended after a half-time altercation with teammate Albert Luque over a free kick. Ajax ended the season in third place. Suárez scored 22 goals in 31 league matches and finished second in scoring tables, one goal behind Mounir El Hamdaoui of AZ. Suárez was also named Ajax Player of the Year.\n\nBefore the 2009–10 season, Martin Jol replaced Van Basten as head coach. After the departure of Ajax captain Thomas Vermaelen to Arsenal, Jol named Suárez team captain. Suárez started scoring goals early in the season with a hat-trick in a 4–1 win against RKC Waalwijk. He had a number of multiple-goal matches throughout the season, including four in wins over Slovan Bratislava in the UEFA Europe League play-off round, VVV-Venlo and Roda JC. He scored three in the first half in another win over VVV-Venlo and six against WHC Wezep in the KNVB Cup as Ajax won by a club-record margin of 14–1.\n\nSuárez scored two goals in the second leg of the KNVB Cup final and finished as the tournament's top scorer. Ajax won the Cup final 6–1 on aggregate over Feyenoord, but they finished second in the league behind Twente.\n\nSuárez ended the season as the Eredivisie's top scorer with 35 goals in 33 matches and had 49 goals in all competitions. He was named Ajax Player of the Year for the second straight year and Dutch Footballer of the Year.\n\nSoon after Suárez returned from his World Cup campaign, he scored his 100th goal for Ajax in a 1–1 home draw against PAOK in a UEFA Champions League qualifier. This put him in an elite group of players, including Johan Cruyff, Marco van Basten and Dennis Bergkamp, to score 100 or more goals with the club. Suárez continued his scoring run with a hat-trick against De Graafschap in a 5–0 win.\n\nOn 20 November 2010, Suárez bit PSV's Otman Bakkal on the shoulder during a 0–0 draw. Ajax suspended him for two matches and fined him an undisclosed amount, which the club said they would donate to a \"good cause\". The Dutch daily newspaper \"De Telegraaf\" branded Suárez the \"Cannibal of Ajax\". The KNVB increased Suárez's suspension to seven league matches. Suárez apologised for his actions through a video he uploaded to his Facebook page.\n\nDuring the suspension, Ajax were in contact with other European clubs interested in Suárez. On 28 January 2011, they accepted a €26.5 million (£22.8 million) offer for Suárez from Premier League club Liverpool. Despite leaving while suspended, Suárez departed Ajax on good terms, and he was given a farewell sendoff after an Ajax match. During the sendoff, an Ajax coach spoke to him and the crowd and said how the club wished he could stay longer; the crowd applauded their agreement and fireworks followed. Ajax ended the 2010–11 season as Eredivisie champions and Suárez was given a winner's medal for his 7 goals in 13 appearances. While he was at Ajax, Suárez scored 111 goals in 159 appearances.\n\nOn 31 January 2011, Suárez signed a five-and-a-half-year deal with Liverpool until 2016, and was the club's most expensive signing (£22.8 million) until the arrival of Andy Carroll (£35 million) a few hours later. Suárez requested the number seven shirt, but at the time did not realise that it had been worn by Liverpool legends such as his new manager Kenny Dalglish and Kevin Keegan. Suárez made his Liverpool debut on 2 February against Stoke City at Anfield in a 2–0 win; he came on as a substitute and scored Liverpool's second goal in front of the Kop in the 79th minute. He was one of Liverpool's best players during his partial season and helped Liverpool go from 12th in the league in mid-January to finish sixth. He finished the 2010–11 season with four goals in 13 games.\n\nAfter winning the Player of the Tournament at the 2011 Copa América, Suárez had a disappointing 2011–12 season by his standards. Liverpool finished in eighth place and Suárez scored 11 league goals. On 26 February, Liverpool won the League Cup, defeating Cardiff City in penalty shootout. On 28 April, Suárez scored his first Liverpool hat-trick in 3–0 win against Norwich City at Carrow Road. He finished sixth for the 2011 FIFA Ballon d'Or.\n\nThe season was marked by an incident in which Suárez was found guilty by a three-man panel from The Football Association (FA) of racially abusing Patrice Evra during a match against Manchester United in October; he was issued an eight-match suspension and a £40,000 fine. Suárez disputed this decision.\n\nAfter a 1–1 draw against Manchester United on 15 October 2011, Suárez was accused of racially abusing Evra, and the FA opened up an investigation into the incident. Suárez wrote on his Twitter and Facebook pages that he was upset by the accusation and denied the claims. On 16 November, the FA announced it would charge Suárez with \"abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour contrary to FA rules\", including \"a reference to the ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race of Patrice Evra\". Liverpool later released a statement announcing Suárez would plead innocent, adding they would \"remain fully supportive\" of him. On 20 December, the FA concluded a seven-day hearing, handing Suárez an eight-match ban and a £40,000 fine for racially abusing Evra.\n\nIn their next meeting in February, during the pregame handshakes, Suárez avoided shaking Evra's hand, for which Suárez and Dalglish were later forced to apologise. Suárez was also banned for one match for making an obscene gesture towards Fulham fans.\n\nOn 7 August 2012, Suárez signed a new long-term contract with Liverpool. On 26 August, he scored his first goal of the 2012–13 season in a 2–2 draw with champions Manchester City at Anfield. On 29 September 2012, Suárez scored a hat-trick in Liverpool's Premier League fixture away at Norwich City for the second consecutive season.\nOn 6 January 2013, Suárez handled the ball before scoring the decisive goal in Liverpool's 2–1 win over Mansfield Town from the Conference National in an FA Cup third round match. Liverpool's manager Brendan Rodgers defended his player by claiming \"it's not his job to own up\", while Mansfield manager Paul Cox said he felt \"a little bit gutted\" by the \"instinctive\" handball, but admitted he would have accepted a goal scored like that by one of his players.\n\nOn 19 January, Suárez scored his seventh goal in three matches against Norwich, as Liverpool cruised to a 5–0 home league victory. The following week, Suárez captained Liverpool for the first time for the FA Cup fourth round match against Oldham Athletic; Liverpool lost 2–3. On 2 March, Suárez scored a hat-trick against Wigan Athletic, leading Liverpool to a dominant 4–0 victory at the DW Stadium. In so doing, he became only the third Liverpool player to score 20 Premier League goals in a single season after Robbie Fowler and Fernando Torres. On 10 March, Suárez scored his 50th goal in all competitions since joining \"the Reds\" by scoring the opener in a 3–2 home victory over Tottenham Hotspur, ending Spurs' 12-match unbeaten run. He was also named man of the match for his performance after he won the decisive penalty which Steven Gerrard converted.\n\nAt the end of the season, Suárez was one of six players named on the shortlist for PFA Players' Player of the Year. Suárez finished second in the final ballot behind Gareth Bale of Tottenham and was named in the PFA Team of the Year. He was second-top goalscorer in the Premier League for 2012–13 with 23 goals and Liverpool's top scorer in all competitions with 30 goals. On 28 May 2013, he was named as Liverpool's player of the season after receiving 64% of votes in a poll of the club's supporters.\nOn 21 April 2013, during a 2–2 draw with Chelsea in a Premier League match at Anfield, Suárez bit Branislav Ivanović; this was the second time Suárez had bitten an opponent. It was not noticed by the officials, and Suárez scored an equaliser in injury time. The bite prompted UK Prime Minister David Cameron to call on the FA to take a hard line with Suárez: the FA charged him with violent conduct and he was fined an undisclosed sum by his club. Contrary to claims from Suárez, Ivanović did not accept an apology. Suárez accepted the violent conduct charge but denied the FA's claim the standard punishment of three matches was clearly insufficient for his offence. A three-man independent panel appointed by the FA decided on a ten-game ban for Suárez, who did not appeal the ban; the panel criticised Suárez for not appreciating \"the seriousness\" of the incident when he argued against a long ban. The panel also wanted to send a \"strong message that such deplorable behaviours do not have a place in football\", while noting that \"all players in the higher level of the game are seen as role models, have the duty to act professionally and responsibly, and set the highest example of good conduct to the rest of the game – especially to young players\".\n\nOn 31 May 2013, Suárez said he would be seeking an exit from Liverpool in the summer, citing excessive media attention on his family as a reason for wanting to leave. On 6 August, after Liverpool had rejected a bid of £40,000,001 for the player from Arsenal, Suárez reiterated his wish to leave Liverpool and said Liverpool had previously promised to allow him a transfer if the club failed to qualify for the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League. The following day, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers said Liverpool had not broken any promises to Suárez and that the player had shown \"total disrespect\" for the club. After this incident, the British press reported that Suárez had been instructed to train away from the Liverpool first-team squad by Rodgers. On 8 August, Liverpool owner John W. Henry stated that Suárez would not be allowed to leave the club.\n\nOn 14 August, Suárez appeared to reverse his position about wanting to leave the club, with reports stating he wanted to stay at the club and that he was possibly going to sign a contract extension, citing the support from Liverpool supporters as the reason for his unexpected turnaround. Suárez returned to first-team training two days later after \"offer[ing] contrition\" to his teammates but reportedly not apologising to his manager.\n\nOn 25 September, Suárez returned to the Liverpool team after his suspension to make his first appearance of the 2013–14 season in a League Cup third round tie against Manchester United at Old Trafford, losing 1–0. On 29 September, Suárez made his first Premier League appearance of the season, scoring twice as Liverpool defeated Sunderland 3–1 at the Stadium of Light. On 5 October, Suárez made his first appearance of the season at Anfield, where he scored Liverpool's opening goal in a 3–1 win against Crystal Palace. On 26 October, he scored his fourth Premier League hat-trick, his first at Anfield, in a 4–1 defeat of West Bromwich Albion. According to the BBC, he has scored a hat-trick every 20.3 Premier League matches, \"the best rate of all 46 players to have scored more than one treble\" in the top tier.\n\nOn 4 December, Suárez scored four goals against Norwich City in a 5–1 home win. He became the first player in Premier League history to score three hat-tricks against the same club, and took his scoring record against Norwich to 11 goals in 5 matches. On 15 December, Suárez captained Liverpool for the first time in a Premier League match against Tottenham Hotspur. He scored twice and assisted once as the team recorded a 5–0 win at White Hart Lane to close the gap on league leaders Arsenal to two points. The following day, Suárez was named the Football Supporters' Federation Player of the Year for 2013. On 20 December, Suárez signed a new four-and-a-half-year contract with Liverpool.\n\nOn 1 January 2014, by scoring in a 2–0 home win over Hull City, Suárez became the first Liverpool player to score 20 or more goals in successive Premier League seasons since Robbie Fowler in 1994–95 and 1995–96. He equalled Andy Cole's Premier League record for the earliest date to reach the 20-goal mark, but set a new record low of 15 matches. His strike partnership this season with Daniel Sturridge has earned them a nickname \"SAS\", \"i.e.\", \"Sturridge and Suárez\".\n\nOn 1 March, Suárez made his 100th Premier League appearance, scoring in a 3–0 win over Southampton at St Mary's Stadium. In the following fixture, he scored his 25th league goal of the season as Liverpool defeated Manchester United at Old Trafford for the first time since 2009 by a convincing three-goal margin. On 22 March, Suárez scored his sixth Premier League hat-trick, and third of the season, in a 6–3 win over Cardiff City at the Cardiff City Stadium. On 30 March, he broke Robbie Fowler's club record of 28 goals in a Premier League season in a 4–0 home win against Tottenham which took Liverpool top of the league with six matches remaining. On 20 April, he scored in a 3–2 win at Norwich to become the first Liverpool player to score 30 league goals in a season since Ian Rush in 1986–87. This also made him the seventh player to score 30 goals in a Premier League season, following Andy Cole, Alan Shearer, Kevin Phillips, Thierry Henry, Cristiano Ronaldo and Robin van Persie.\n\nOn 18 April, Suárez was named as one of the six players nominated for the PFA Player of the Year award for the second consecutive season. On 27 April, he won the award, becoming the first non-European to win the award. On 5 May 2014, Suárez was named as the Football Association Writers Player of the Year. He finished the season with 31 goals in 33 matches, winning the Premier League Golden Boot, with Sturridge as runner-up, as Liverpool came second in the league and returned to the UEFA Champions League. Suárez also won the Barclay's Premier League Player of the Season award. As the Premier League's top scorer with 31 goals, he also shared the European Golden Shoe with Cristiano Ronaldo. On 21 May 2014, Suárez ranked number one on \"Europe's most influential player\" list of the year, ahead of Lionel Messi, Zlatan Ibrahimović and Cristiano Ronaldo, according to a study by Bloomberg of the top five European leagues.\n\nOn 11 July 2014, Suárez agreed with Barcelona on a five-year contract for an undisclosed transfer fee. However, according to a leaked document by Football Leaks, the fee was £64.98 million (€82.3 million), making him one of the most expensive players in world football history. \"Barça\" confirmed Suárez would wear the number 9 shirt for the 2014–15 season.\n\nSuárez missed the first part of the season after being found guilty of biting Italian player Giorgio Chiellini at the 2014 FIFA World Cup. As part of the suspension, he was banned from all \"football-related activities\", including training for Barcelona, for four months (until 26 October). He was also banned from entering any stadium, even as a spectator, during the same period.\n\nOn 24 July, Suárez and his lawyers filed an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and requested the sanctions be reduced or the suspension to be lifted. The parties were heard at a hearing which took place at the CAS offices in Lausanne, Switzerland, on 8 August. Six days later, the CAS confirmed the ban imposed by FIFA against Suárez, who remained suspended from football for four months, as well as a nine-match ban in internationals, the first of which was served in the Uruguay's round of 16 match against Colombia in the 2014 World Cup. However, the CAS removed the player's \"football-related activities\" ban and was allowed to train with Barcelona. As a result of this ban, Suárez was banned from participating in the 2015 Copa América.\n\nThe CAS permitted Suárez to play in friendly matches, and he made his Barcelona debut on 18 August against Club León of Mexico at the Camp Nou, replacing Rafinha for the final 14 minutes of an eventual 6–0 win in the Gamper Trophy. Fellow forwards Lionel Messi and Neymar had already been substituted off by the time Suárez took to the pitch.\n\nSuárez made his competitive debut for Barcelona on 25 October, starting in attack with Lionel Messi and Neymar away to Real Madrid in \"El Clásico\". Although he set up Neymar for the opening goal in the fourth minute, Suárez was substituted in the second half and Barcelona lost 3–1. He scored his first goal for the club on 26 November in a 4–0 win at APOEL in the UEFA Champions League group stage. On 20 December, he scored his first league goal for the club in his eighth La Liga match, contributing to a 5–0 home win against Córdoba.\n\nOn 24 February 2015, Suárez scored twice as \"Barça\" defeated English champions Manchester City 2–1 in the first leg of their UEFA Champions League round of 16 tie. On 4 March, he scored in Barcelona's 3–1 Copa del Rey semi-final win over Villarreal to qualify the club for its 37th Spanish Cup final. On 8 March, Suárez scored twice in a 6–1 home win over Rayo Vallecano. On 22 March 2015, Suárez scored the winning goal for Barcelona in the 2–1 victory over Real Madrid at Camp Nou. In the post-match press conference, his coach Luis Enrique lauded Suárez, saying, \"Very few players can score a goal like he did, and that is why we signed him. He can decide games. He's a pure scorer, who needs very little to finish.\"\n\nOn 15 April, Suárez scored two goals in a 3–1 UEFA Champions League quarter-final first leg victory over Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes. He nutmegged PSG defender David Luiz twice before scoring both goals. On 2 May, he scored his first hat-trick for the club, in 8–0 win at Córdoba. Suárez scored in the Champions League final against Juventus on 6 June in Berlin, putting the team back into the lead in an eventual 3–1 win by converting the rebound after Gianluigi Buffon saved from Messi. The win sealed a treble for the team.\n\nSuárez ended his first season at Barcelona with 25 goals and 20 assists in all competitions. The Barcelona attacking trio of Messi, Suárez and Neymar, dubbed \"MSN\", ended with 122 goals, the most in a season for an attacking trio in Spanish football history.\n\nSuárez opened the season by scoring and assisting on a goal in Barcelona's 5–4 extra-time victory over Sevilla in the 2015 UEFA Super Cup, on 11 August 2015. The next day, he was named one of the three finalists for the 2015 UEFA Best Player in Europe Award. On 31 October, Suárez scored in a 2–0 away win against Getafe after being assisted with a backheel from Sergi Roberto. This was his 11th goal of the season and his 300th senior career goal. On 21 November, Suárez scored twice in Barcelona's 4–0 away win against Real Madrid.\n\nOn 17 December, Suárez scored all three goals as Barcelona defeated Chinese club Guangzhou Evergrande 3–0 in the 2015 FIFA Club World Cup semi-final in Yokohama, Japan, becoming the first player to score a hat-trick in the competition's history. He then scored twice in Barcelona's 3–0 win over Argentine club River Plate in the final. Suárez finished the tournament as top scorer with five goals and was also named the best player of the tournament.\n\nOn 3 February 2016, Suárez scored four goals in the 7–0 Copa del Rey win against Valencia. On 20 April, he again scored four times in a match, as well as assisting three further goals for teammates, as \"Barça\" won 8–0 away at Deportivo de La Coruña in La Liga. Only three days later, he scored another four goals in a 6–0 home win over Sporting de Gijón, for which Suárez became the first player to score four times in two consecutive matches in the history of La Liga. On 30 April, Suárez became the second player in the history of the club to reach the milestone of 35 goals in a single season.\n\nOn the final day of the 2015–16 La Liga season, Suárez scored a hat-trick in a 3–0 victory at Granada to win the Spanish championship for \"Barça\" and registered 40 league goals for the season to win the Pichichi Trophy, for which Suárez became the first player since 2009 to win both the Pichichi and the European Golden Shoe other than Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. Fourteen of his goals came in his last five matches. Suárez also led the league in assists, tied at 16 with Messi, becoming the first player ever to lead La Liga in both goals and assists.\n\nOn 22 May 2016, Suárez suffered a season-ending injury during Barcelona's 2–0 victory over Sevilla in the 2016 Copa del Rey Final. The club confirmed after the match that Suárez had suffered an injury to his right hamstring, and would likely miss at least part of the upcoming Copa América Centenario with his national football team. For Uruguay, Suárez also previously missed part of the 2014 World Cup and the entire 2015 Copa América through suspension. The front three of Messi, Suárez and Neymar finished the season with 131 goals, breaking the record they had set the previous year for most goals by an attacking trio in a single season.\n\nSuárez opened his goal scoring account by scoring a goal in the first leg of the 2016 Supercopa de España against Sevilla and winning the match 0–2. In the first match of the 2016–17 La Liga season, Suárez scored a hat-trick in a 6–2 victory against Real Betis in which he scored his first free-kick goal for Barcelona. Suárez made his 100th Barcelona appearance in a 2–1 defeat at home to Alavés. Though unable to score, Suárez claimed the distinction of scoring more goals and assists in his first 100 matches in Spain than both Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi; Suárez contributed 88 goals and 43 assists in his first 100 matches for Barcelona, compared to Ronaldo's 95 goals and 29 assists, and Messi's 41 goals and 14 assists.\n\nSuárez opened his UEFA Champions League account for the season with two goals in a 7–0 defeat of Celtic; this was followed by another goal in a 5–1 defeat of Leganés. On 11 January 2017, Suárez scored his 100th goal for Barcelona in a Copa del Rey round of 16 match against Athletic Bilbao.\n\nOn 7 February, Suárez scored and was later sent off for a second yellow in the semi-final match of the Copa del Rey against Atlético Madrid for an alleged foul on Koke, his first red card competitively for Barcelona, meaning he would miss the final. In an interview after the match, Suárez said he strongly disagreed with the decision, and wished to appeal it, saying, \"I'm laughing at that second yellow, it's not even a foul. I did absolutely nothing. I hope the club will appeal it.\"\n\nOn 23 September, Suárez scored in Barcelona’s win over Girona in the first ever Catalan derby for the opposition. On 14 October, Suárez maintained Barcelona’s undefeated start to a La Liga season with a late header against Atlético Madrid at the Wanda Metropolitano in Madrid. He scored twice against Leganés in a 3–0 win at the Estadio Municipal de Butarque on 18 November. On 17 December, Suárez scored two against Deportivo La Coruña in a 4–0 win. Less than a week later, Suárez opened the scoring for Barcelona in a 3–0 win over Real Madrid at the Bernabéu.\n\nAfter the mid season break, on 14 January Suárez scored twice in a 4–2 comeback win at Real Sociedad. Suarez scored a hat-trick in a 6–1 win over Girona at the Camp Nou on 24 February. On 31 March, late goals from Suarez and Messi secured a 2–2 draw against Seville at the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán. On 14 April, Suárez scored as Barcelona defeated València 2–1 to secure the longest unbeaten streak (39 games) in La Liga history.\n\nOn 21 April, Barcelona won their fourth consecutive Copa del Rey title in beating Sevilla 5–0 in Madrid, with Suárez scoring twice. Barcelona held on for a dramatic 2–2 draw against Real Madrid on 6 May to extend their unbeaten streak in the league, with Suárez and Messi scoring the goals for Barca, before Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale drew Real level. Barcelona's record unbeaten streak (43 games) came to an end on 13 May losing to Levante 4–5. Barcelona mounted a comeback after trailing 1–5, with Suárez scoring one and new club record signing Philippe Coutinho scoring a hat-trick.\n\nOn 2 September 2018, Suárez scored twice for Barcelona in an 8–2 win over newly promoted Huesca. A week later he scored in their 2–1 victory at Real Sociedad, as the club made it four wins out of four in La Liga. On 28 October, Suárez scored a hat-trick in a 5–1 home win over Real Madrid in \"El Clásico\". Suárez is the only the second Barcelona player (after Messi) to score a hat-trick in \"El Clasico\" in La Liga since Romário in 1994.\n\nSuárez was invited to play for Uruguay in the qualifying rounds for the 2007 U-20 World Cup, but his club, Groningen, did not release him to play. He did play in the tournament finals, and he scored two goals in four appearances. His goals came in a group stage draw against Spain and in the Round of 16 against the United States, but the U.S. won 2–1 and Uruguay was eliminated from the tournament.\n\nSuárez made his senior debut for Uruguay on 8 February 2007 in a 3–1 win against Colombia. He was sent off in the 85th minute after receiving a second yellow card for dissent. Suárez played in 19 of 20 games in 2010 World Cup qualifying and the\ninter-confederation playoffs and scored five goals.\n\nIn June 2010, Óscar Tabárez named Suárez to Uruguay's 23-man World Cup squad. Uruguay began the tournament with a 0–0 draw against France. In the second match, a 3–0 win over South Africa, Suárez drew a penalty and assisted Álvaro Pereira's stoppage time goal. In the final match of the group stage, he headed in a goal off a pass from Edinson Cavani and was named Man of the Match in a 1–0 win over Mexico. Uruguay won Group A and advanced to the knockout stage.\n\nDuring the round of 16 against South Korea, Suárez scored both goals in a 2–1 win. His second broke a tie in the 80th minute when he dribbled around a defender and curled a \"spectacular shot\" in off the far post; Suárez was again named Man of the Match. This win put Uruguay through to the quarter-finals for the first time since 1970. In the quarter-final against Ghana, the score was 1–1 at the end of regulation and the match went into extra time. Late in extra time, Ghana sent a free-kick into the box, and Suárez blocked Stephen Appiah's shot on the goal line. He then blocked Dominic Adiyiah's goalbound header with his hands, committing a professional foul to save what would have been the game winner and was sent off. Asamoah Gyan hit the crossbar with the ensuing penalty kick and Suárez, who had stopped to watch, celebrated the miss before heading down the tunnel. Uruguay won the shootout 4–2 and advanced to the semi-finals.\nAfter the match, Suárez said, \"I made the save of the tournament.\" He said he had no alternative, was acting out of instinct, and would do it again if it helped his team win. Ghana head coach Milovan Rajevac said the play was an \"injustice\" and Suárez was labelled a villain and a cheat. Others viewed him as a hero. Due to the automatic suspension that accompanies a red card, Suárez sacrificed himself in the semi-final for the unlikely chance the penalty would be missed, and his team would later win.\n\nWhile Suárez was suspended for the semi-final match for his red card against Ghana, Uruguay \"lacked a second striker <nowiki>[</nowiki>alongside Diego Forlán<nowiki>]</nowiki> of cunning and movement\" and lost 3–2 to the Netherlands. Suárez returned for the third place game against Germany; he was booed almost every time he had the ball because of his handball in the Ghana match. He assisted Cavani on Uruguay's first goal, but Uruguay lost 3–2. During the tournament, Suárez played 543 minutes in six appearances and scored three goals.\n\nIn the 2011 Copa América tournament, Suárez scored in Uruguay's opening game, a 1–1 draw with Peru. Uruguay finished second in their group and advanced to the knockout round with a win and two draws. In the quarter-finals, Uruguay finished regulation and extra time tied at 1–1 with tournament hosts Argentina. Uruguay won the shootout 5–4 and Suárez converted his penalty. Suárez scored both goals in Uruguay's 2–0 semi-final win over Peru and was named Man of the Match. In the final, Suárez scored the first goal and Uruguay defeated Paraguay 3–0 for their record 15th Copa América title. Suárez scored four goals in the tournament and was named Player of the Tournament.\n\nOn 9 July 2012, Suárez was selected for the Uruguay Olympic football team alongside Liverpool teammate Sebastián Coates to compete in the 2012 Olympic Games. In the first pre-tournament warm-up game against Chile, Suárez scored a hat-trick for Uruguay as they came from 0–2 down to win 6–4 in a thrilling match.\n\nAs one of Uruguay's three overage players, Suárez was named as captain for the Olympic Games. After an opening win over the United Arab Emirates, Uruguay were defeated by Senegal and Great Britain and eliminated at the first round. Suárez failed to score during the tournament.\n\nSuárez was selected in the Uruguay squad to play in Brazil at the 2013 Confederations Cup. He scored a curling free-kick from in a 2–1 defeat to Spain in their opening match at Recife on 16 June. He then scored twice after appearing as a substitute in Uruguay's 8–0 win over Tahiti, making him the Uruguay national team's all-time top-goalscorer with 35 goals, surpassing his teammate Diego Forlán. Uruguay were eventually eliminated in the semi-finals, losing 2–1 to Brazil in Belo Horizonte.\n\nSuárez ended the 2014 World Cup qualification campaign as top scorer in the South American section with 11 goals. In November 2013, Uruguay defeated Jordan 5–0 on aggregate in an intercontinental play-off to qualify for the 2014 World Cup.\n\nOn 22 May, Suárez underwent emergency surgery on his left knee. He was confined to a wheelchair for a time, leading to rumours he would be unable to participate in the World Cup. He was named as a substitute for Uruguay's first match, a 3–1 defeat to Costa Rica, but did not play in the match. Suárez started Uruguay's second match against England and scored both of the team's goals in a 2–1 win at the Arena Corinthians in São Paulo.\n\nFor Uruguay's final group match against Italy on 24 June, Uruguay needed a win to advance to the knockout stage while Italy only needed a draw. Around the 79th minute and with the score at 0–0, Suárez clashed with Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini while waiting for a cross. Replays showed that Suárez lunged at Chiellini and bit his shoulder (Chiellini showed bite marks), followed by Suárez falling and clutching his face. The controversial incident made headline news around the world. As the Italian players protested to Mexican referee Marco Antonio Rodríguez for not penalising Suárez for the bite, Uruguay won a corner and scored. The match would finish 1–0 to Uruguay as they qualified for the knockout stage and eliminated Italy.\n\nTwo days later, on 26 June, the FIFA Disciplinary Committee, banned Suárez for nine international matches, effective immediately, meaning he would take no further part in the World Cup. The ban ruled him out of 2015 Copa América as well. It was the longest such ban in World Cup history, exceeding the eight-match ban handed to Italy's Mauro Tassotti for breaking the nose of Spain's Luis Enrique at the 1994 World Cup. He was also banned from taking part in any football-related activity (including entering any stadium) for four months and fined CHF100,000. The seven-member FIFA panel studied the incident from 34 camera angles and rejected Suárez's defence that the bite was as a result of an accidental collision, instead finding the bite was \"deliberate, intentional and without provocation... with the intention of wounding [Chiellini] or at least of destabilising him\". The severity of the penalty was due to the fact it was Suárez's third biting offence, as well as what FIFA saw as a lack of remorse. Soon after the suspension was announced, online gambling firm 888poker cancelled its sponsorship deal with Suárez. With Suárez banned, Uruguay lost their next match 0–2 to Colombia and were eliminated from the World Cup.\n\nOn the same day the ban was announced, the Uruguayan Football Association (AUF) said it would appeal the suspension. Suárez's lawyer said that \"we don't have any doubts\" of a European-based campaign against Suárez. Various Uruguayan individuals defended Suárez, questioning if he had actually bitten Chiellini, and criticised the severity of his ban, including President of Uruguay José Mujica, who labelled the ban \"fascist\" and called FIFA \"a bunch of old sons of bitches\"; AUF president Wilmar Valdez; Uruguay captain Diego Lugano; and Uruguay head coach Óscar Tabárez, who resigned from two FIFA posts in protest of the ban. The Uruguayan media were also noted to have been in a defiant and defensive mood. For non-Uruguayan parties, Chiellini, who was bitten, called the ban \"excessive\", while international players' union FIFPro called for Suárez to \"receive all the support he needs\" and that the \"focus should be on the rehabilitation and serious treatment\" of Suárez.\n\nSix days after the incident, on 30 June, Suárez apologised to Chiellini through Twitter and vowed never to repeat the incident, while writing that the \"physical result of a bite\" occurred in a collision with Chiellini. Chiellini responded through Twitter indicating all was forgotten and his hope that FIFA would reduce Suárez's suspension.\n\nOn 3 July, the AUF appealed Suárez's ban, but it was rejected by FIFA on 10 July. With Suárez's ban not preventing him from transferring to another club, it was announced on 11 July that Suárez had agreed to move to Barcelona. Days before the transfer, Suárez's apology to Chiellini had been praised by various Barcelona club individuals. Barcelona club president Josep Maria Bartomeu said the apology was \"honourable\", sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta welcomed Suárez as being \"humble enough to admit an error\" while new signing Ivan Rakitić commended Suárez's \"character and strength\".\n\nOn 25 March 2016, after over a year of international absence for Uruguay, Suárez scored an equalizer against Brazil in Recife for a 2–2 draw in the qualification process for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Suárez was included in Uruguay's 23-man squad for the Copa América Centenario, although a hamstring injury sustained in the 2016 Copa del Rey final on 22 May put his place in the team in jeopardy. Although he remained in the squad, he missed both of his national side's opening group losses to Mexico and Venezuela, which resulted in a first-round elimination from the tournament. He was once again left on the substitutes' bench in Uruguay's final 3–0 group win over Jamaica on 13 June.\n\nSuárez scored twice on 10 October 2017 as Uruguay won 4–2 at home to Bolivia in their final World Cup qualifying match, thus securing their place for the tournament in Russia. In March, Uruguay won the 2018 China Cup, and Suárez scored his 50th international goal with a penalty against the Czech Republic in the semi-finals, winning it himself when fouled by goalkeeper Jiří Pavlenka. He won his 100th cap on 20 June 2018 in Uruguay's second group match at the World Cup, scoring the only goal against Saudi Arabia at the Rostov Arena in Rostov-on-Don to advance the nation into the last 16. In the final group game on 25 June, Suárez scored Uruguay’s opener with a free kick into the bottom corner in a 3–0 win over hosts Russia. In the Round of 16 match against Portugal on 30 June, he set-up Cavani's opening goal in an eventual 2–1 victory. Uruguay were eliminated from the tournament following a 2–0 defeat to France in the quarter-finals on 6 July.\n\nSuárez creates goal scoring chances with his powerful shot, and has \"remarkable technical ability\" according to his FIFA profile. Known for his direct running at players, Suárez has a particular penchant for nutmegging opponents (putting the ball through their legs). Liverpool fans (accompanied with a banner) used to say he was so good, \"he could nutmeg a mermaid\". Harry Redknapp said that Suárez could play anywhere – as the target man or behind as a second striker. Uruguay head coach Óscar Tabárez called Suárez \"a great forward, an elite player among forwards in the world\", and Liverpool coach Kenny Dalglish said, \"he's intelligent, he's had a fantastic education at Ajax\". Former Liverpool striker John Aldridge said his abilities allow him to get into a position to score and evade defenders. Suárez has been praised for his work rate, and his quickness that allows him to attack from the outside. He also creates scoring opportunities for his teammates.\n\nFormer Ajax coach Marco van Basten criticised Suárez for his tendency to receive yellow cards. Van Basten said he had a tense relationship with Suárez, although he conceded, \"Luis is unpredictable, he's hard to influence but that makes him special.\" At times, Suárez can be dominant but fail to convert his efforts into goals. Despite his weaknesses, Suárez's leadership stood out to Ajax management.\n\nSuárez has been widely accused of diving. His manager, teammates and various analysts have commented that this reputation for simulation has caused referees not to award him legitimate penalties. In January 2013, Suárez admitted to diving against Stoke City in an October 2012 match. This led his manager Brendan Rodgers to comment his actions were \"unacceptable\" and that he would be dealt with \"internally\" by the club. Suárez has also been accused of stamping on opponents in the Premier League and the UEFA Europa League. In December 2013, Spanish football website \"El Gol Digital\" ranked Suárez at fifth in its list of the world's dirtiest footballers. During the 2018 World Cup game against Portugal, after collisions with Portuguese players, Suarez twice acted like he had a head injury despite Suarez's head not being touched.\n\nSuárez has a sponsorship deal with German sportswear and equipment supplier Adidas. Suárez starred in a 2014 advert for Beats with other global football stars including Neymar and Thierry Henry, with the theme of \"The Game Before the Game\" and the players' pre-game ritual of listening to music. In Uruguay, Suárez has also appeared in advertisements for Abitab, Antel, Cablevisión, Garnier, Pepsi and Samsung.\n\nSuárez features in EA Sports' \"FIFA\" video game series: in keeping close to the real life game Suárez‘s ban for his bite on Giorgio Chiellini at the 2014 World Cup was replicated in \"FIFA 15\", with the player unavailable for gamers to select until his ban ended on 26 October.\n\nActive on social media, Suárez has over 28 million Instagram followers, the most for a person from Uruguay.\n\nSuárez was born in Salto, Uruguay, the fourth of seven boys. His older brother, Paolo Suárez, is also a professional footballer, currently playing for Isidro Metapán in El Salvador.\n\nSuárez moved with his family to Montevideo when he was seven, and his parents separated when he was nine. In Montevideo, he developed his football skills on the streets, while also taking up work as a street sweeper. The contrast between his life in Europe and the poverty he left behind has been cited as contributing to his periodic aggression on the field, as well as being a possible explanation for the more forgiving attitudes of the Uruguayan public and press towards such cases, compared to Europe.\nSuárez is of mixed race, with public records indicating his having a black grandfather. The matter of ethnicity was raised in reporting on the Patrice Evra incident, where use by his grandmother, Lila Piriz, of \"mi negrito\" as a sobriquet has been offered to explain Suárez's repeated use of \"negro\" over the two-minute altercation; the FA judged his evidence unreliable \"en route\" to issuing him an eight-match ban.\n\nSuárez began dating Sofía Balbi at age 15 in Montevideo; the Balbi family moved to Barcelona in 2003, and Suárez's focus on football strengthened as a result as he wanted to follow them to Europe to join Sofía again. Suárez married her in 2009, and the couple have a daughter and a son. He has a tattoo of his daughter’s name Delfina on his wrist which he kisses as part of his goal celebration – this celebration routine is featured in EA Sports’ video game \"FIFA 15\". On 11 July 2014, Suárez joined Barcelona, allowing him to live closer with his wife Sofía's family. On the move, Suárez said, \"[Liverpool] did all they could to get me to stay, but playing and living in Spain, where my wife's family live, is a lifelong dream and ambition. I believe now the timing is right.\" In 2014, Suárez released his autobiography, \"Crossing the Line – My Story\".\n\nNacional\n\nAjax\n\nLiverpool\n\nBarcelona\n\nUruguay\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3008367", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3008367", "title": "Maria Anna of Spain", "text": "Maria Anna of Spain\n\nInfanta Maria Anna of Spain (18 August 1606 – 13 May 1646) was a Holy Roman Empress and Queen of Hungary and Bohemia by marriage to Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor. She acted as regent on several occasions during the absences of her spouse.\n\nDaughter of King Philip III of Spain and Margaret of Austria, prior to her Imperial marriage she was considered a possible wife for Charles, Prince of Wales; the event, later known in history as the \"Spanish Match\", provoked a domestic and political crisis in the Kingdoms of England and Scotland. In the imperial court in Vienna she continued to be strongly influenced by her native Spanish culture (from clothes to music) and also to promote the strengthening of relations between the Imperial and Spanish branches of the House of Habsburg.\n\nInfanta Maria Anna of Spain was born in the Palace of El Escorial, near Madrid, on 18 August 1606 as the fourth child and third (but second surviving) daughter of King Philip III of Spain and his wife Margaret of Austria, Archduchess of the Inner Austrian branch of the House of Habsburg. Of her seven siblings, only four survived infancy: Anna (later wife of King Louis XIII of France), Philip IV of Spain, Charles (who died young in 1632) and Ferdinand (the later known Cardinal-Infante and Governor of the Spanish Netherlands). Maria Anna's parents had a close kinship: her father was her mother's first cousin once-removed. On her father's side she was the granddaughter of King Philip II of Spain, and his fourth wife and niece Archduchess Anne of Austria, and on her mother's side she was the granddaughter of Charles II, Archduke of Inner Austria and his wife Princess Maria Anna of Bavaria.\n\nFrom early childhood, Maria Anna has played an important role in the matrimonial projects of her father. In adolescence she was betrothed to Archduke John-Charles, eldest son and heir of Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor and his first wife Maria Anna of Bavaria; however, the marriage never took place due to Archduke John-Charles' early death in 1618.\n\nIn 1622, King James I of England received an offer from the Spanish King Philip IV to strengthen the relations of their countries through a dynastic marriage between Charles, Prince of Wales, and Infanta Maria Anna. London and Madrid began active negotiations. The possible marriage between the Prince of Wales and the Spanish Infanta, was known in history under the name \"Spanish Match\", and caused an internal political crisis in both England and Scotland. In 1623 the Prince of Wales, accompanied by George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, visited Madrid to meet his intended bride. However, Maria Anna did not wish to marry a Protestant and Charles would not convert to Catholicism. At the end, the wedding never took place not only for political reasons but also because of the reluctance of the new Spanish King to conclude a dynastic marriage with the House of Stuart. Charles eventually married Henrietta Maria of France.\n\nAt the end of 1626 Maria Anna was betrothed to the younger brother of her first fiancé, Ferdinand, new heir of Emperor Ferdinand II. The formal engagement was preceded by a series of negotiations which were conducted in 1625. That same year, Prince Ferdinand was crowned King of Hungary, and in 1627 King of Bohemia. In the negotiations were included all the life aspects of the Infanta at the court of her future spouse. Despite the desire of the groom that Maria Anna's confessor would be the Jesuit Ambrosio Penalosa, the appointment eventually went to Capuchin Diego Quiroga. In the marriage contract signed by both parties in 1628, it was noted that Maria Anna could retain her rights of inheritance over the Spanish throne, while her older sister Infanta Anna, married to King Louis XIII of France in 1615, was forced to renounce to her rights.\n\nMaria Anna had left Madrid for Vienna in December 1629. The travel took more than a year. En route by sea, in Genoa complications arose due to an epidemic of the plague that erupted in the Italian Peninsula. For this reason, the cortege was unable to stop in Bologna, where Cardinal Antonio Barberini (nephew of Pope Urban VIII), was waiting for the Infanta to give her the Golden Rose. The cortege moved to Naples, where Maria Anna finally received the award. Leaving the Kingdom of Naples, the Infanta crossed the Papal States, having made a pilgrimage to the Basilica della Santa Casa. On this section of her journey Maria Anna was accompanied by Roman aristocracy, led by another nephew of Pope Urban VIII, Taddeo Barberini, Prince of Palestrina. On 26 January 1631 she arrived in Trieste, where she met Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, her future brother-in-law, who escort the Infanta to the Vienna court. That day, Maria Anna was married to King Ferdinand of Hungria-Bohemia \"per procura\" with Archduke Leopold Wilhelm serving as the proxy.\n\nBefore the official wedding, King Ferdinand, not trusting the previous portraits that he had seen of the Infanta, decided to secretly watch his bride. The Royal \"oberhofmeister\" asked for an audience with Maria Anna; on this visit, he was accompanied by some nobles, among whom was her groom. Struck by the beauty of the Infanta, King Ferdinand immediately revealed his identity and began a conversation with Maria Anna in Spanish. The love and respect that the future emperor felt for his wife lasted through all their marriage. He was never unfaithful to her or had illegitimate children.\n\nIn Vienna on 20 February 1631 Maria Anna was formally married with King Ferdinand of Hungary-Bohemia, with festivities lasting a month. The marriage was described as friendly. Maria Anna was described as happy-tempered, friendly, and intelligent, and she able to ease the feelings of the melancholic Ferdinand.\n\nWith Maria Anna, arrived at the Imperial court in Vienna the Spanish fashion, theater, dance and music (including the first sounded guitar). As the wife of the heir, she maintained good relations with all the members of her husband's family; however, she had a complicated relationship with Ferdinand's stepmother, Empress Eleonora Gonzaga, mainly because between both began a competition for influence at the Imperial court. Maria Anna also paid much attention to the arts, especially painting. She collected works of Italian, Spanish and Flemish painters of the late Renaissance and early Baroque.\n\nIn Regensburg on 22 December 1636 Ferdinand was elected King of the Romans, and a week later he was crowned by the Archbishop of Mainz. Maria Anna was crowned Queen of Germany one month later, on 21 January 1637. After his father's death on 15 February 1637, Ferdinand became Holy Roman Emperor under the name of Ferdinand III and sovereign King of Hungary and Bohemia. After him, his wife received the titles of Holy Roman Empress and sovereign Queen. Her coronation as Queen of Hungary took place in Pressburg during the Hungarian Diet of 1637–1638.\n\nMaria Anna, being active politically as the adviser of her spouse, was an important mediator between the Emperor and their Spanish relatives. Despite the fact that she always defended the interests of her husband, she didn't forget the interests of her brothers King Philip IV and the Cardinal-Infante. In her court, which was consisted mainly of Spaniards, frequent guests were the Spanish ambassador and diplomats. The Emperor, during his absences from the imperial court in Vienna, appointed his wife as regent, for example in 1645 during the Thirty Years' War, when he was in the Kingdom of Bohemia.\n\nIn March 1645 Maria Anna and her children left Linz, due to the approach of the Protestant Swedish army, and moved to Vienna. By April it was ready to cross the Danube there and threatened to occupy the city. The Imperial family fled instead temporarily to Graz. After returning to Vienna, they were forced to move again to Linz because of the plague. The Empress' sixth pregnancy became known in January 1646; four months later, on 12 May at Linz Castle, Maria Anna suddenly felt ill with fever and heavy bleeding and died the next morning. Her unborn child, a girl, was taken out alive from her womb. She was named Maria after her mother, but only lived a few hours. On 24 May both mother and daughter in the same coffin were moved to Vienna and buried in the Imperial Crypt, which already contained the coffins with the remains of the two sons of the Empress who died earlier. The funeral cortege was accompanied by the Spanish ambassador and the Empress' maid of honor. Very upset by the death of his wife and child, the Emperor was unable to attend the funeral. However, after returning to Vienna in late August he finally paid his respects to the remains of Maria Anna, and in September he announced the engagement of their eldest daughter Maria Anna with Balthasar Charles, Prince of Asturias. However, the Prince died the following month shortly after the announcement. It should be noted that the Spaniards courtiers members of the late Empress' household who came with her from Spain, including her confessor and the maids of honor of the late Empress, stayed at the Imperial court in Vienna and lived there for a few more years after her death.\n\nDuring her marriage, Maria Anna gave birth to six children:\n\nJowitt views the character of princess Donusa in Massinger's 1624 play \"The Renegado\" as an allegory of the Infanta during the failed marriage attempt.\n\nIn 1634, the Spanish poet and playwright Pedro Calderón de la Barca, in honor of the victory of the Spaniards and Austrians over the Swedes in the Battle of Nördlingen, set in Madrid a performance in which Maria Anna with her husband was one of the actors.\n\nSave a few portraits of Maria Anna as child, almost all of them are included in the collection of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. In the earliest of these paintings, made by Juan Pantoja de la Cruz, she is shown at one year of age. A portrait of the Infanta Maria Anna, then Queen of Hungary and Bohemia, made by Diego Velázquez, court painter at Madrid, was part of the collection of the Museo del Prado. Portraits of the Empress made by Frans Luycx (painter at the court in Vienna), Bartolomé González y Serrano, Rodrigo de Villandrando, Justus Sustermans, Juan van der Hamen and other unknown authors are also stored in the collections of the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Museo del Prado, the gallery of the Schloss Esterházy in Eisenstadt and the Musée Fesch in Ajaccio.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27756027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27756027", "title": "Nintendogs + Cats", "text": "Nintendogs + Cats\n\nThe game is one of the first online-enabled titles that uses the Nintendo Network, and is the first Nintendo-published title to do so, although the Nintendo Network brand itself was not revealed until early 2012. All three editions of the game were re-released as digital Nintendo eShop downloadables on January 30, 2013 in Japan, December 19, 2013 in Europe, and November 6, 2014 in North America.\n\nThe game retains much the same style of gameplay as the original \"Nintendogs\", including various breeds of dogs and cats as well as training exercises included in the first game. The tricks, however, have been changed; there is now a tutorial for each trick as the game progresses, and the player is no longer required to say exactly the same name of the trick. In addition to touchscreen and microphone input, the game also employs the system's camera along with facial recognition technology to interact with the player. For example, after a while, the player's pet will recognize them and will likewise greet them. However, if a new player shows up, they may react negatively. If the trainer puts their face close to the camera, then the puppy will come up to the screen and lick them; they will also mimic them if they tilt their head.\n\nCompetitions are also included, once again with five cups each: Junior, Amateur, Pro, Master and Nintendogs. In addition to Disc Competition and Obedience Trial, a new competition, Lure Coursing, is added to the game. Like the original, Nintendogs + Cats has the ability to \"retry\" competitions. To do this, you can simply save the game before entering a competition, and if the dog places an undesirable rank, close the game and retry it.\n\nThe 3D capabilities of the 3DS are also utilized. The game also uses augmented reality capabilities to project the player's dog or cat onto one of the \"?\" AR Games cards. In addition to this, if one of the Nintendo character cards (i.e. Mario, Link, Samus, Kirby, etc.) is used, the dogs will appear wearing hats, fitting the theme of their respective games (These hats are also in the 3DS built-in app, StreetPass Mii Plaza by unlocking them when a dog or cat hero defeats an enemy depending on the room they are in during the game \"Find Mii\"). The game uses SpotPass and often a Presidential Victor will appear, which is a President and their dog appearing in the game.\n\nThe game comes in three different versions: \"Nintendogs + Cats: French Bulldog & New Friends\", \"Nintendogs + Cats: Golden Retriever & New Friends\", and \"Nintendogs + Cats: Toy Poodle & New Friends\". Each version features a French Bulldog, a Golden Retriever, and a Toy Poodle, respectively, as well as many other breeds for each game. In Japan, the Golden Retriever version is called \"Shiba Inu & New Friends\" (Like Lab & Friends in the previous generation), a more common breed in Japan; albeit not a cover dog, the Shiba Inu is still present in-game in the International versions.\n\nEach version begins with nine dog breeds, but all twenty seven are unlockable in each game by playing. All the breeds from the original Nintendogs games return as well as eight new breeds which include the French Bulldog, Basset Hound, Great Dane and Pomeranian. There are three cat varieties that appear in each version of the game, however there are no distinct breeds.\n\nGame designer Shigeru Miyamoto stated that the idea of dogs and cats getting along came from his own pets. Them getting along made him think of the Disney movie \"The Incredible Journey\". He stated that \"Making a game called \"Nintencats\" just didn't seem right for Nintendo\", so he brought cats into \"Nintendogs\".\nThis was a great way for owners to get close to the pets, and experience new dogs as they move on.\n\n\"Nintendogs + Cats\" has received generally mixed to positive reviews by critics, having an aggregate score of 74.14% on GameRankings and 71/100 on Metacritic. Japanese magazine \"Famitsu\" gave the game a 38/40, two points less than the original, but still the highest points for a Nintendo 3DS launch title.\n\nTwo months after the first launch, Nintendo announced that \"Nintendogs + Cats\" had sold 1.71 million units, making it officially the first platinum title for the Nintendo 3DS platform. As of December 31, 2015, the game has worldwide sales of 3.96 million.\n\n"}
{"id": "1119090", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1119090", "title": "No-win situation", "text": "No-win situation\n\nA no-win situation, also called a “lose-lose situation”, is one where a person has choices, but no choice leads to a net gain. For example, if an executioner offers the condemned the choice of death by being hanged, shot, or poisoned, all choices lead to death; the condemned is in a no-win situation. This bleak situation gives the chooser no room: whichever choice is made the person making it will lose their life. Less drastic situations may also be considered no-win situations - if one has a choice for lunch between a ham sandwich and a roast beef sandwich, but is a vegetarian or has a wheat allergy, that might also be considered a no-win situation.\n\nIn game theory, a \"no-win\" situation is one in which no player benefits from any outcome. This may be because of any or all of the following:\n\nCarl von Clausewitz's advice (never to launch a war that one has not already won) characterizes war as a no-win situation. A similar example is the Pyrrhic victory, in which a military victory is so costly that the winning side actually ends up worse off than before it started. Looking at the victory as a part of a larger situation, the situation could either be no-win, or more of a win for the other side than the one that won the \"victory\", or victory at such cost that the gains are outweighed by the cost and are no longer a source of joy.\n\nFor example, the \"victorious\" side may have accomplished their objective, but the objective may have been worthless, or they may lose a strategic advantage in manpower or positioning. (One example is Great Britain in WWII, where Britain was one of the victorious powers, but found itself so exhausted in the process as to no longer be able to maintain its great power status in a world now dominated by the United States and the Soviet Union.) A related concept is sometimes described as winning the battle but losing the war, where a lesser (sub-) objective is won but the true objective beyond it is not well pursued and is lost.\n\nIn past Europe, those accused of being witches were sometimes bound and then thrown or dunked in water to test their innocence. A witch would float (by calling upon the Devil to save her from drowning), and then be executed; but a woman not a witch would drown (proving her innocence but causing her death).\n\nUnwinnable is a state in many text adventures, graphical adventure games and role-playing video games where it is impossible for the player to win the game (either due to a bug or by design), and where the only options are restarting the game, loading a previously saved game, wandering indefinitely, or a game over (negative game end, such as death). It is also known as a dead end situation. Usually, this is the result of the player's previous choices, and not due to the game itself lacking a path to victory. For example, in games such as \"Goldeneye 007\", \"Perfect Dark\", and \"TimeSplitters\", the level does not end once a player fails an objective short of being killed, but it is impossible to progress to the next level no matter what the player does afterwards. Other games take steps to \"avoid\" unwinnable situations; for example, a game may not allow players to drop items which are necessary to continue.\n\n\"Unwinnable\" should not be confused with \"unbeatable\", which is used to describe a character, monster, or puzzle that is too powerful or difficult to be overcome by the player or character at a lower standing, and is normally found in role-playing video games. In many cases, \"unbeatable\" gamestates occur because of integer overflow or other errors programmers did not take into account, called a kill screen. In this situation, the game may also crash.\n\nIn the film \"WarGames\", the supercomputer WOPR simulates all possible games of tic-tac-toe as a metaphor for all possible scenarios of a nuclear war, each of them ending in a nuclear holocaust (mutual assured destruction). The computer then exclaims, \"A strange game; the only winning move is not to play.\"\n\nIn the \"Star Trek\" canon, the \"Kobayashi Maru\" simulation is a no-win scenario designed as a character test for command track cadets at Starfleet Academy. It first appears in the film \"\". In the film, Admiral James T. Kirk states that he does not believe in the no-win scenario.\n\nIn the TV show \"Quantico\", the agents are put in a terrorist hijack flight simulation mission that is unbeatable.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21508", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21508", "title": "Noosphere", "text": "Noosphere\n\nThe noosphere (; sometimes noösphere) is the sphere of human thought. The word derives from the Greek νοῦς (nous \"mind\") and σφαῖρα (sphaira \"sphere\"), in lexical analogy to \"atmosphere\" and \"biosphere\". It was introduced by Pierre Teilhard de Chardin in 1922 in his \"Cosmogenesis\". Another possibility is the first use of the term by Édouard Le Roy (1870–1954), who together with Teilhard was listening to lectures of Vladimir Ivanovich Vernadsky at the Sorbonne. In 1936, Vernadsky accepted the idea of the noosphere in a letter to Boris Leonidovich Lichkov (though he states that the concept derives from Le Roy. Citing the work of Teilhard's biographer—Rene Cuenot—Sampson and Pitt stated that although the concept was jointly developed by all three men (Vernadsky, LeRoy, and Teilhard), Teilhard believed that he actually invented the word: \"I believe, so far as one can ever tell, that the word 'noosphere' was my invention: but it was he [Le Roy] who launched it.\"\n\nIn the theory of Vernadsky, the noosphere is the third in a succession of phases of development of the Earth, after the geosphere (inanimate matter) and the biosphere (biological life). Just as the emergence of life fundamentally transformed the geosphere, the emergence of human cognition fundamentally transforms the biosphere. In contrast to the conceptions of the Gaia theorists, or the promoters of cyberspace, Vernadsky's noosphere emerges at the point where humankind, through the mastery of nuclear processes, begins to create resources through the transmutation of elements. It is also currently being researched as part of the Princeton Global Consciousness Project.\n\nTeilhard perceived a directionality in evolution along an axis of increasing \"Complexity/Consciousness\". For Teilhard, the noosphere is the sphere of thought encircling the earth that has emerged through evolution as a consequence of this growth in complexity / consciousness. The noosphere is therefore as much part of nature as the barysphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere. As a result, Teilhard sees the \"social phenomenon [as] the culmination of and not the attenuation of the biological phenomenon.\" These social phenomena are part of the noosphere and include, for example, legal, educational, religious, research, industrial and technological systems. In this sense, the noosphere emerges through and is constituted by the interaction of human minds. The noosphere thus grows in step with the organization of the human mass in relation to itself as it populates the earth. Teilhard argued the noosphere evolves towards ever greater personalisation, individuation and unification of its elements. He saw the Christian notion of love as being the principal driver of noogenesis. Evolution would culminate in the Omega Point—an apex of thought/consciousness—which he identified with the eschatological return of Christ.\n\nOne of the original aspects of the noosphere concept deals with evolution. Henri Bergson, with his \"L'évolution créatrice\" (1907), was one of the first to propose evolution is \"creative\" and cannot necessarily be explained solely by Darwinian natural selection. \"L'évolution créatrice\" is upheld, according to Bergson, by a constant vital force which animates life and fundamentally connects mind and body, an idea opposing the dualism of René Descartes. In 1923, C. Lloyd Morgan took this work further, elaborating on an \"emergent evolution\" which could explain increasing complexity (including the evolution of mind). Morgan found many of the most interesting changes in living things have been largely discontinuous with past evolution. Therefore, these living things did not necessarily evolve through a gradual process of natural selection. Rather, he posited, the process of evolution experiences jumps in complexity (such as the emergence of a self-reflective universe, or noosphere). Finally, the complexification of human cultures, particularly language, facilitated a quickening of evolution in which cultural evolution occurs more rapidly than biological evolution. Recent understanding of human ecosystems and of human impact on the biosphere have led to a link between the notion of sustainability with the \"co-evolution\" and harmonization of cultural and biological evolution.\n\n\n\n"}

Prisoners who have recently received bad news from home or are demonstrating an inability to adapt to the institutional environment may also be at higher risk. Objective tests such as the Beck Depression Inventory are of limited usefulness because a malingerer may fake signs of being suicidal while a prisoner who does not want to be stopped from committing suicide may hide signs of being suicidal. Prisoners with illnesses are at higher risk of suicide, with prisoners with AIDS have a suicide rate between 16 and 36 times higher than that of the general population.\n\nPrisons in the United Kingdom had a sharp rise in suicides between 1972 and 1987, with hanging being the most common suicide method. A study found that 47% of the deaths in Finnish prisons were suicides. Large percentages of those who commit suicide in prison do so after having recently received mental health services, although only one-third of prison suicides are found to have a psychiatric history, as opposed to 80–90 percent of suicides in the general community. The suicide rate in U.S. federal prisons is lower than the nationwide average. Pretrial detainees tend to have higher rates of suicide than other inmates, with about a third of all prison suicides occurring within the first week of custody. Custodial suicide is the leading cause of death among detainees housed in jails.\nAccording to data by the Council of Europe, in the Balkans the suicide rate in prisons is lower than in the rest of Europe: between 2011 and 2015 there were on average 53 cases of suicide each year for every 100,000 prisoners in the Balkans, and 87 in the rest of Europe. This may be explained by the fact that in Balkan countries the incarceration rate is relatively high – so the prisons are not populated by people that are particularly vulnerable – and the use of preventive detention is rather low.\n\nSuicides occur most commonly in isolation cells. The most common time for suicides to occur is in the early morning hours. Suicidal inmates are sometimes put on suicide watch. The suicide rate among prisoners is four times as high as among the general population, but it is unknown whether this is because of the prison environment or because persons with marked suicidal tendencies are more liable to be imprisoned for crime. The apparent motivation for prison suicide appears to be fear of other inmates, of the consequences of one's crime, or imprisonment, and the loss of a significant relationship.\n\nIn the United States, liability can arise under and the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution if jail and prison officials demonstrate deliberate indifference toward a prisoner's suicidal tendencies, as suicidal inmates are regarded as being in need of medical care. In \"Farmer v. Brennan\", deliberate indifference was established as a standard between negligence and acting with purpose or intent, thus amounting basically to recklessness. The \"Farmer\" decision has created difficulties for plaintiffs in proving suicide liability as a violation of constitutionally established civil rights. The burden of proof appears to be higher than in malpractice cases. Case law provides that liability only exists if prison officials had subjective knowledge of (or at least willful blindness to) an inmate's serious medical need. I.e., they cannot be held liable if they merely \"should\" have known, but did not actually know.\n\nMere negligence is not enough for there to be a constitutional violation. The federal courts seldom allow recovery based on section 1983 absent extreme instances of deliberate indifference to a suicidal prisoner or a clear pattern of general indifference to suicidal inmates. There has to have been a strong likelihood rather than a mere possibility that a suicide would occur. Courts have also found that there is no duty to screen every prisoner for suicide potential, unless it is obvious that an inmate has such tendencies or propensities. Further, even if prison officials are aware of the inmate's suicidal tendencies and he does commit suicide, they are not liable if they took reasonable actions to prevent the suicide. In determining deliberate indifference, the practical limitations on jailers in preventing inmate suicides must be taken into account.\n\nExamples of failures that can give rise to claims related to suicide in correctional settings include inadequate mental health and psychiatric examination, failure to consider obvious and substantial risk factors in assessing potential for suicide, failure to place an inmate on suicide precautions upon recognizing the obvious and substantial risk, failure to communicate the action taken to other providers or to custody and jail staff, failure to adequately monitor an inmate on suicide watch and maintain an appropriate observation log, discontinuation of suicide watch despite prior knowledge of suicidal behavior of the inmate and potential continued risk, failure to follow policies and procedures related to suicide risk assessment, intervention, and prevention, failure to provide training to correctional staff, abrupt discontinuation of psychotropics in an inmate who is known to have made a serious suicide attempt in the recent past, and grossly inadequate treatment by professional standards or the lack of treatment plans, policies, procedures, or staff, creating a grossly inadequate mental health care system, and repeated examples of delayed or denied medical treatment.\n\nOne criticism of the current case law is that prison officials are incentivized to avoid screening inmates for suicidal tendencies, because if the screening is ineffective, or the jail fails to deter the suicidal attempt of a prisoner it knows is suicidal, the governmental entity and the jailer may be at greater risk of being held liable than if they had conducted no screening. Nonetheless, some jails screen anyway, since jail suicides are difficult on staff and on the municipality and often lead to legal action, and because some states mandate screening procedures and impose tort liability for failure to follow them. Elected officials may face political ramifications if they become the scapegoat for a prisoner suicide.\n\nAnother factor that has led to more screening of inmates for suicide is that research has shown that suicide tends to be the result of a plan rather than impulsive, which makes the suicide potentially more foreseeable if proper screening is done.\n\n"}
{"id": "13620318", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13620318", "title": "Religion of Humanity", "text": "Religion of Humanity\n\nReligion of Humanity (from French \"Religion de l'Humanité\" or \"église positiviste\") is a secular religion created by Auguste Comte, the founder of positivist philosophy. Adherents of this religion have built chapels of Humanity in France and Brazil.\n\nIn the United States and Europe, Comte's ideas influenced others, and contributed to the emergence of ethical societies and \"ethical churches\", which led to the development of Ethical culture, congregational humanist, and secular humanist organisations.\n\nComte developed the \"religion of humanity\" for positivist societies in order to fulfill the cohesive function once held by traditional worship. The religion was developed after Comte's passionate platonic relationship with Clotilde de Vaux, whom he idealised after her death. He became convinced that feminine values embodied the triumph of sentiment and morality. In a future science-based Positivist society there should also be a religion that would have power by virtue of moral force alone. In 1849, he proposed a calendar reform called the \"positivist calendar\", in which months were named after history's greatest leaders, thinkers, and artists, and arranged in chronological order. Each day was dedicated to a thinker.\n\nAccording to Tony Davies, Comte's secular and positive religion was \"a complete system of belief and ritual, with liturgy and sacraments, priesthood and pontiff, all organized around the public veneration of Humanity\", referred to as the \"Nouveau Grand-Être Suprême\" (New Supreme Great Being). \"This was later to be supplemented in a positivist trinity by the \"Grand Fétish\" (the Earth) and the \"Grand Milieu\" (Cosmic Space)\". \n\nIn \"Système de politique positive\" (1851–1854) Comte stated that the pillars of the religion are: \n\nIn \"Catéchisme positiviste\" (1851), Comte defined the Church of Humanity's seven sacraments:\n\nThe Religion of Humanity was described by Thomas Huxley as \"Catholicism minus Christianity\". In addition to a holy trinity of Humanity, the Earth and Destiny, it had a priesthood. Priests were \"required\" to be married, because of the ennobling influence of womanhood. They would conduct services, including Positivist prayer, which was \"a solemn out-pouring, whether in private or in public, of men's nobler feelings, inspiring them with larger and more comprehensive thoughts.\" The purpose of the religion was to increase altruism, so that believers acted always in the best interests of humanity as a whole. The priests would be international ambassadors of altruism, teaching, arbitrating in industrial and political disputes, and directing public opinion. They should be scholars, physicians, poets and artists. Indeed all the arts, including dancing and singing should be practiced by them, like bards in ancient societies. \n\nThis required long training. They began training from the age of twenty-eight, studying in positivist schools. From thirty-five to forty-two a priest served in an apprentice position as teacher and ritualist. Only at the age of forty-two could he become a full priest. They earned no money and could not hold offices outside the priesthood. In this way their influence was purely spiritual and moral. The High Priest of Humanity was to live in Paris, which would replace Rome as the centre of religion.\n\nDavies argues that Comte's austere and \"slightly dispiriting\" philosophy of humanity - viewed as alone in an indifferent universe (which can only be explained by \"positive\" science) - \"was even more influential in Victorian England than the theories of Charles Darwin or Karl Marx\".\n\nThe \"system\" was ultimately unsuccessful but, along with Darwin's \"On the Origin of Species\", it influenced the proliferation of various Secular Humanist organizations in the 19th century, especially through the work of secularists such as George Holyoake and Richard Congreve. Although Comte's English followers, including George Eliot and Harriet Martineau, for the most part rejected the full panoply of his system, they liked the idea of a religion of humanity and his injunction to \"vivre pour altrui\" (\"live for others\", from which comes the word \"altruism\").\n\nProfound criticism came from John Stuart Mill who advocated Comte but dismissed his Religion of Humanity in a move towards a differentiation between the (good) early Comte, the author of \"The Course in Positive Philosophy\" and the (problematic) late Comte, who authored the Religion of Humanity. While sympathising with the need for a secular religion, and appreciating Comte’s respect for “the Human Race, conceived as a continuous whole, including the past, he present and the future”, Mill thought that the details of Comte’s ritualism were not only illiberal but “could have been written by no man who had ever laughed”.\nComtean Positivism was relatively popular in Brazil. In 1881 Miguel Lemos and Raimundo Teixeira Mendes organized the \"Positivist Church of Brazil.\" In 1897 the \"Temple of Humanity\" was created. The services at the Temple could go on for up to four hours and that, combined with a certain moral strictness, led to some decline during the Republican period. Nevertheless it had appeal with the military class as Benjamin Constant joined the group before breaking with it because he deemed Mendes and Lemos as too fanatical. Cândido Rondon's conversion proved more solid as he remained an orthodox Positivist and a member of the faith long after the church's importance waned. Although declined, the church still survives in Brazil. The national flag of Brazil bears the \"Ordem e Progresso\" (\"Order and Progress\"), inspired by Comte's motto of positivism: \"L’amour pour principe et l’ordre pour base; le progrès pour but\" (\"Love as a principle and order as the basis; progress as the goal\").\n\nThere are more examples of Religion of Humanity started by positivists, and there are several authors who have given the epithet to the religion they support, whatever the religion. In India Baba Faqir Chand established Manavta Mandir (Temple of Humanity) to spread his religion of humanity with scientific attitude as explained by David C. Lane in a book \"The Unknowing Sage\". Comte influenced the thought of Victorian secularists George Holyoake (coiner of the term \"secularism\") and Richard Congreve.\n\n\n"}

In 1964 he won the David Murray Landscape Award from the Royal Academy, and started a course at the Royal College of Art, but soon gave it up and took up manual work in mines and building sites. At the age of 21, he featured in a BBC TV documentary, \"The Quiet Rebel\", in which he described his commitment to his art and the pressures on him to get a \"real job\". He later spent some time teaching in Ebbw Vale.\n\nHe worked privately in the house in Abertillery in which he had been born and brought up, and was sometimes described as reclusive. He was only persuaded by friends to start exhibiting his work in 1987, and was not affiliated to any artistic group or movement. From the late 1980s, his works were widely exhibited in Wales and elsewhere.\n\nHe was known for both his figurative and largely abstract paintings, \"rich in imagery, poetry and colour, which are drawn from his environment, the industrial valley towns and mountains.\" His works often incorporate everyday materials such as sandpaper, primer, and Polyfilla, as well as conventional paint.

In a sense, strategically timed military exercises can serve as an explicit form of saber rattling, in that the extent of a country's military muscle is put up on display for other countries (namely, adversaries) to see.\n\nIn 1924, Chile was in the throes of an economic and political crisis. The economy, heavily dependent on the export of nitrates, was suffering the effects of the discovery of artificial nitrates during World War I. At the same time, Chile was politically paralyzed by a conflict between President Arturo Alessandri and the conservatively controlled congress, who refused to discuss any of the drafts that he sent them.\n\nOn February 1, 1924, the political parties signed an agreement to change the parliamentary procedures in order to limit the censure votes (a procedure used to force cabinet ministers to resign), to allow the closure of debates by simple majority and in general to eliminate all dilatory tactics, especially those dealing with the national budget. As an additional measure, they agreed to create a parliamentary stipend (30.000 pesos for the senators, 15.000 pesos for the deputies). This program was received with public outcry, mainly because it was the only law that had been produced by the governing coalition while the social measures prepared by President Alessandri had been postponed time and again. In the Army, the news were especially bitter since they had been waiting for a salary increase for a long time. \n\nOn September 3, 1924, a group of 56 young military officers (mostly lieutenants and sub-lieutenants coming from middle classes or working classes), led by Colonel Marmaduke Grove and Major Carlos Ibáñez del Campo, attended the session where the congressional salary discussion was to take place. They quietly sat in the public tribunes, and waited for the topic to be broached. At that point the president of the chamber, feeling intimidated, demanded that the public be cleared, as the discussion was to be secret. As the officers silently started to leave, they began to rattle the scabbards (chapes) of the sabers they wore as part of their dress uniform against the floor, as a way to indicate their discontent with the political class in general, and in sign of support to Alessandri's social agenda.\n\nThis event was the culmination of a process that marked the increasing desire by the military corps of a more active participation in Chilean politics. Since the 1891 Chilean Civil War, the military had been excluded although they were very dependent from all political groups for their advancement. It is also one of the events that mark the end of the so-called \"Parliamentary Republic\" (1891-1925), also known as the \"pseudo-parliamentary period\" because the executive was subject to the legislative but checks and balances of executive over legislative were weakened.\n\nThe very next day the same group of young military officers involved led by Colonel Marmaduke Grove and Major Carlos Ibáñez del Campo, created a \"military committee\" to defend themselves from possible punishments by the government. On September 5, the \"military committee\" demanded that President Arturo Alessandri dismiss three of his ministers, including the minister of War and Navy Gaspar Mora; the enactment of a labor code, the passage of an income tax law, and the improvement of the military salaries. \n\nFaced with almost open military insurrection, Alessandri had no option but to appoint General Luis Altamirano, the Army Inspector General (Chief of the Army), as head of a new cabinet. On September 8, General Altamirano appeared in front of Congress to demand the passage of eight laws, including Alessandri's labor code. Congress dared not to protest, and the laws, which had been languishing for years, were passed in a matter of hours. These included the Eight-hour day, suppression of child labour, clear rules for collective bargaining, legislation on occupational safety, legalization of trade unions, a law on cooperatives and the creation of courts of conciliation and labour arbitrage.\n\nAt that point Alessandri felt that he had become just a pawn of the military, and, on September 9, he resigned and requested asylum at the US Embassy. Congress refused to accept his resignation, and instead granted him a six-months constitutional leave of absence. He left the country immediately for Italy. General Altamirano assumed power as Vice President, and on the 11th, a military Junta was established to rule the country on the absence of the titular president, Alessandri.\n\n\n"}

From then on he began to write and teach about spiritual matters.\n\nIn the 1990s he published detailed descriptions of the major mystical traditions of the world, the synthesis of which he called Mysticosophy. His aim was to show that all major mystical traditions seek, through various practices, to help a person advance via two major routes: the awakening of spiritual consciousness, and the creation of the body of light.\n\nIn 2014 he founded the ashram known as \"Casa de los Cuatro Rumbos\" (House of the Four Directions), near the city of Atlixco, Puebla, which offers courses and retreats.\n\nHe has published over fifty books. Hundreds of his lectures are available for free on YouTube.\n\nHe lives in Puebla, with his wife Ruth and his sons Andrés and Diego.\n\nJose Antonio Ramon Calderón was born in Puebla, Mexico, on August 15, 1956, to an upper-class family. He was the third of the six children of Casiano Ramón Pérez and María Trinidad Calderon Tell.\n\nDuring his dissolute adolescence he felt an increasingly growing inner emptiness, which led him on an intense spiritual search and, eventually, to meeting his spiritual teacher.\n\nFor a short period of time he studied Anthropology at the Universidad Iberoamericana, but soon quit to dedicate himself fully to his spiritual practices.\n\nOn July 7, 1977, Shiva enrolled in a course of Tibetan yoga taught by Pedro Espinosa de los Monteros, who became his spiritual teacher.\n\nThe course, called \"The Science of MentalPhysics\", had been designed, and introduced in America, by Edwin Dingle. It subjected students to a regimen of breathing exercises, affirmations, and sexual energy transmutation practices.\n\nAfter performing these practices for a year and a half, Shiva began experiencing various energy-related manifestations, or Kundalini syndrome, and some alterations of consciousness, which intensified over time. He described these experiences in a diary, which he published years later as part of an autobiographical book entitled \"Con los pies en el sendero del yoga y el misticismo\" (With my Feet on the Path of Yoga and Mysticism).\n\nIn 1979, Shiva began to meditate. He first used a technique to purge the mind, which requires being attentive and passively observant of the flow of thoughts, feelings and emotions that appear in one's stream of consciousness. Doing this ultimately leads to their disappearing, leaving the mind in a clear and quiet state.\n\nAs these experiences intensified, Shiva's interests became almost exclusively spiritual. He abandoned his Anthropology studies, and dedicated himself almost exclusively to spiritual practices, and to reading and reflecting on spiritual matters.\n\nIn July 1980, he had his first mystical experience, which he described as a contact with his higher self, and which was accompanied by \"a powerful sense of timelessness or eternity.\"\n\nSeveral mystical experiences followed, which revealed to him the \"fountain that remains...beyond mutation and change...outside of time and space.\" \n\nFor months he struggled to remain in a state that he recognized as the one Jiddu Krishnamurti called \"awareness\" and which George Gurdjieff described as \"self-remembering\". Because of these efforts, in early 1983, Shiva permanently became what he would later describe as an \"awakened man,\" that is, a person who is continually \"simultaneously aware of himself and of his surroundings\", in contrast with the common person or \"sleeping man\", which according to Shiva lives in a \"state of psychic sleep\".\n\nOn November 11, 1985 Shiva had his first experience of oneness with the absolute, in which \"the whole universe disappeared, and only the infinite and eternal Absolute remained. There was no residue of individuality to realize it\".\n\nSince 1986, Shiva has written several books, taught several courses, and spoken in conferences and retreats, to publicize the difference between the \"sleeping state\" and the \"awakened state\", and the practices that lead from one to the other. He has also described the path and practices that can lead an awakened person to have superior mystical experiences.\n\nMisticosophy: synthesis of the world's mystical traditions.\n\nHis most significant academic work consists of having studied and described the mystical traditions of Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, Zen, Christianity, the Ancient Egyptian Religion, Judaism, Sufism and Toltecayotl, and synthesizing them to show that they all seek to guide humankind on how to advance on two different routes: the awakening of spiritual consciousness and the creation of the body of light. This work was published in a series of books, each of which examines a specific mystical tradition in the light of one of the two routes \n\nTeachings on how to advance on the route of the awakening of spiritual consciousness\n\nThese teachings address the steps and practices necessary to move from the state of a common person or \"sleeping man\", to a state of awareness or \"awakened man.\" According to Shiva, the common person lives in a state of \"psychic dream\", a fact which is easily verifiable by conducting the following experiment:\n\"Pay attention to yourself and, simultaneously, to the place where you are. That is, \"remember yourself\" (in the sense of being aware of yourself, and not in the sense of thinking of yourself). Be aware of your body (do not think about it). Be mindful of it. Now you are aware of yourself. Stay in that state. Do not forget yourself, and then go on with your daily activities ... [by attempting this] you will discover how difficult it is to stay in that state, as it will not take more than a few minutes to become unaware of yourself and to return to the state of psychic dream\".\n\nThrough various meditation exercises, the practitioner achieves ever longer periods of mindfulness, until the awakened state becomes permanent. That is the state \"in which one is present, and simultaneously observes both the inner and outer world in a passive manner\".\n\nThe awakening of a person's spiritual consciousness is a process that can be verified by that person, and it does not require him to hold any religious beliefs. In a book entitled \"La experiencia del Despertar\" (The Experience of Awakening), Shiva describes the process of awakening, and the practices that lead to it, without using any of the religious terms with which it is commonly associated. Shiva sees this work as a bridge between spirituality and science, because there is no need to believe or have faith in any of the spiritual experiences described therein, which can be confirmed empirically by the practitioner.\n\nFor those who have already reached a state of permanent spiritual wakefulness, Shiva has also laid out, in several books and lectures, the practices that lead to higher mystical experiences, which culminate with the experience of being one with the absolute.\n\nTeachings on how to advance on the route of the creation of the body of light\n\nThese teachings address the practices needed to gradually increase the flow of energy that circulates through the body's network of energy channels, so as to naturally activate the spiritual faculties of the practitioner, thus eventually producing in him the same awakened state described above. The energy practices that Shiva recommends are mostly psychophysical breathing exercises or Pranayama, and sexual transmutation.\n\nIn 2014, Shiva founded the ashram \"Casa de los Cuatro Rumbos\" (House of the Four Directions), near the city of Atlixco.

In the seas, a whole class (conodonts) and 34% of marine genera disappeared. On land, all archosaurs other than crocodylomorphs (Sphenosuchia and Crocodyliformes) and Avemetatarsalia (pterosaurs and dinosaurs), some remaining therapsids, and many of the large amphibians became extinct.\n\nAt least half of the species now known to have been living on Earth at that time became extinct. This event vacated terrestrial ecological niches, allowing the dinosaurs to assume the dominant roles in the Jurassic period. This event happened in less than 10,000 years and occurred just before Pangaea started to break apart. In the area of Tübingen (Germany), a Triassic-Jurassic bonebed can be found, which is characteristic for this boundary.\n\nStatistical analysis of marine losses at this time suggests that the decrease in diversity was caused more by a decrease in speciation than by an increase in extinctions.\n\nSeveral explanations for this event have been suggested, but all have unanswered challenges:\n\n\n"}

He was agent to an expedition sent by the East India Company, under Captains Hawkins and Keeling, in 1607 to treat with the Great Mogul. Hawkins and Finch landed at Surat on 24 August 1608. They were violently opposed by the Portuguese. Finch, however, obtained permission from the governor of Cambay to dispose of the goods in their vessels. Incited by the Portuguese, who seized two of the English ships, the natives refused to have dealings with the company's representatives. During these squabbles Finch fell ill, and Hawkins, proceeding to Agra alone, obtained favourable notice from the Emperor Jehangir. Finch recovered, and joined Hawkins at Agra on 14 April 1610. The two remained at the mogul's court for about a year and a half, Finch refusing tempting offers to attach himself permanently to the service of Jehangir. \n\nHawkins returned to England, but Finch delayed his departure in order to make further explorations, visiting Byana and Lahore among other places.

Gabriel in an essay \"Worse is better\" to describe the dynamics of software acceptance, but it has broader application. It is the idea that quality does not necessarily increase with functionality—that there is a point where less functionality (\"worse\") is a preferable option (\"better\") in terms of practicality and usability. Software that is limited, but simple to use, may be more appealing to the user and market than the reverse.\n\nAs to the oxymoronic title, Gabriel calls it a caricature, declaring the style bad in comparison with \"The Right Thing\". However he also states that \"it has better survival characteristics than the-right-thing\" development style and is superior to the \"MIT Approach\" with which he contrasted it in the original essay.\n\nGabriel was a Lisp programmer when he formulated the concept in 1989, presenting it in his essay \"Lisp: Good News, Bad News, How to Win Big\". A section of the article, titled \"The Rise of 'Worse is Better'\", was widely disseminated beginning in 1991, after Jamie Zawinski found it in Gabriel's files at Lucid Inc. and e-mailed it to friends and colleagues.\n\nIn \"The Rise of Worse is Better\", Gabriel claimed that \"Worse-is-Better\" is a model of software design and implementation which has the following characteristics (in approximately descending order of importance):\n\n\nGabriel argued that early Unix and C, developed by Bell Labs, are examples of this design approach.\n\nGabriel contrasted his philosophy with what he called the \"MIT/Stanford style of design\" or \"MIT approach\" (also known as \"the Right Thing\"), which he described as follows. Contrasts are in bold:\n\n\nGabriel argued that \"Worse is better\" produced more \"successful\" software than the MIT approach: As long as the initial program is basically good, it will take much less time and effort to implement initially and it will be easier to adapt to new situations. Porting software to new machines, for example, becomes far easier this way. Thus its use will spread rapidly, long before a program developed using the MIT approach has a chance to be developed and deployed (first-mover advantage). Once it has spread, there will be pressure to improve its functionality, but users have already been conditioned to accept \"worse\" rather than the \"right thing\". \"Therefore, the worse-is-better software first will gain acceptance, second will condition its users to expect less, and third will be improved to a point that is almost the right thing. In concrete terms, even though Lisp compilers in 1987 were about as good as C compilers, there are many more compiler experts who want to make C compilers better than want to make Lisp compilers better.\"\n\nGabriel credits Jamie Zawinski for excerpting the worse-is-better sections of \"Lisp: Good News, Bad News, How to Win Big\" and e-mailing them to his friends at Carnegie Mellon University, who sent them to their friends at Bell Labs, \"who sent them to their friends everywhere\". He apparently connected these ideas to those of Richard Stallman and saw related ideas that are important in the design philosophy of Unix, and more generally in the open-source movement, both of which were central to the development of Linux.\n\nGabriel later answered his earlier essay with one titled \"Worse Is Better Is Worse\" under the pseudonym \"Nickieben Bourbaki\" (an allusion to Nicolas Bourbaki).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1265269", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1265269", "title": "Xenobiology", "text": "Xenobiology\n\nXenobiology (XB) is a subfield of synthetic biology, the study of synthesizing and manipulating biological devices and systems. Xenobiology derives from the Greek word \"xenos\", which means \"stranger, guest\". Xenobiology describes a form of biology that is not (yet) familiar to science and is not found in nature . In practice it describes novel biological systems and biochemistries that differ from the canonical DNA-RNA-20 amino acid system (see central dogma of molecular biology). For example, instead of DNA or RNA, XB explores nucleic acid analogues, termed Xeno Nucleic Acid (XNA) as information carriers. It also focuses on an expanded genetic code and the incorporation of non-proteinogenic amino acids into proteins.\n\n\"Astro\" means \"star\" and \"exo\" means \"outside\". Both exo- and astrobiology deal with the search for naturally evolved life in the Universe, mostly on other planets in the circumstellar habitable zone. (These are also occasionally referred to as xenobiology.) Whereas astrobiologists are concerned with the detection and analysis of life elsewhere in the Universe, xenobiology attempts to design forms of life with a different biochemistry or different genetic code than on planet Earth.\n\n\nIn xenobiology, the aim is to design and construct biological systems that differ from their natural counterparts on one or more fundamental levels. Ideally these new-to-nature organisms would be different in every possible biochemical aspect exhibiting a very different genetic code. The long-term goal is to construct a cell that would store its genetic information not in DNA but in an alternative informational polymer consisting of xeno nucleic acids (XNA), different base pairs, using non-canonical amino acids and an altered genetic code. So far cells have been constructed that incorporate only one or two of these features.\n\nOriginally this research on alternative forms of DNA was driven by the question of how life evolved on earth and why RNA and DNA were selected by (chemical) evolution over other possible nucleic acid structures. Two hypotheses for the selection of RNA and DNA as life's backbone are either they are favored under life on Earth's conditions, or they were coincidentally present in pre-life chemistry and continue to be used now. Systematic experimental studies aiming at the diversification of the chemical structure of nucleic acids have resulted in completely novel informational biopolymers. So far a number of XNAs with new chemical backbones or leaving group of the DNA have been synthesized, e.g.: hexose nucleic acid (HNA); threose nucleic acid (TNA), glycol nucleic acid (GNA) cyclohexenyl nucleic acid (CeNA). The incorporation of XNA in a plasmid, involving 3 HNA codons, has been accomplished already in 2003. This XNA is used in vivo (E coli) as template for DNA synthesis. This study, using a binary (G/T) genetic cassette and two non-DNA bases (Hx/U), was extended to CeNA, while GNA seems to be too alien at this moment for the natural biological system to be used as template for DNA synthesis. Extended bases using a natural DNA backbone could, likewise, be transliterated into natural DNA, although to a more limited extent.\n\nAside being used as extensions to template DNA strands, XNA activity has been tested for use as genetic catalysts. Although proteins are the most common components of cellular enzymatic activity, nucleic acids are also used in the cell to catalyze reactions. A 2015 study found several different kinds of XNA, most notably FANA (2'-fluoroarabino nucleic acids), as well as HNA, CeNA and ANA (arabino nucleic acids) could be used to cleave RNA during post-transcriptional RNA processing acting as XNA enzymes, hence the name XNAzymes. FANA XNAzymes also showed the ability to ligate DNA, RNA and XNA substrates. Although XNAzyme studies are still preliminary, this study was a step in the direction of searching for synthetic circuit components that are more efficient than those containing DNA and RNA counterparts that can regulate DNA, RNA, and their own, XNA, substrates.\n\nWhile XNAs have modified backbones, other experiments target the replacement or enlargement of the genetic alphabet of DNA with unnatural base pairs. For example, DNA has been designed that has - instead of the four standard bases A, T, G, and C - six bases A, T, G, C, and the two new ones P and Z (where Z stands for 6-Amino-5-nitro3-(l'-p-D-2'-deoxyribofuranosyl)-2(1H)-pyridone, and P stands for 2-Amino-8-(1-beta-D-2'-deoxyribofuranosyl)imidazo[1,2-a]-1,3,5-triazin-4 (8H)). In a systematic study, Leconte et al. tested the viability of 60 candidate bases (yielding potentially 3600 base pairs) for possible incorporation in the DNA.\n\nIn 2002, Hirao et al. developed an unnatural base pair between 2-amino-8-(2-thienyl)purine (s) and pyridine-2-one (y) that functions \"in vitro\" in transcription and translation toward a genetic code for protein synthesis containing a non-standard amino acid. In 2006, they created 7-(2-thienyl)imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (Ds) and pyrrole-2-carbaldehyde (Pa) as a third base pair for replication and transcription, and afterward, Ds and 4-[3-(6-aminohexanamido)-1-propynyl]-2-nitropyrrole (Px) was discovered as a high fidelity pair in PCR amplification. In 2013, they applied the Ds-Px pair to DNA aptamer generation by \"in vitro\" selection (SELEX) and demonstrated the genetic alphabet expansion significantly augment DNA aptamer affinities to target proteins.\n\nIn May 2014, researchers announced that they had successfully introduced two new artificial nucleotides into bacterial DNA, alongside the four naturally occurring nucleotides, and by including individual artificial nucleotides in the culture media, were able to passage the bacteria 24 times; they did not create mRNA or proteins able to use the artificial nucleotides.\n\nNeither the XNA nor the unnatural bases are recognized by natural polymerases. One of the major challenges is to find or create novel types of polymerases that will be able to replicate these new-to-nature constructs. In one case a modified variant of the HIV-reverse transcriptase was found to be able to PCR-amplify an oligonucleotide containing a third type base pair.\nPinheiro et al. (2012) demonstrated that the method of polymerase evolution and design successfully led to the storage and recovery of genetic information (of less than 100bp length) from six alternative genetic polymers based on simple nucleic acid architectures not found in nature Xeno nucleic acids.\n\nOne of the goals of xenobiology is to rewrite the genetic code. The most promising approach to change the code is the reassignment of seldomly used or even unused codons. \nIn an ideal scenario, the genetic code is expanded by one codon, thus having been liberated from its old function and fully reassigned to a non-canonical amino acid (ncAA) (“code expansion”). As these methods are laborious to implement, and some short cuts can be applied (“code engineering”), for example in bacteria that are auxotrophic for specific amino acids and at some point in the experiment are fed isostructural analogues instead of the canonical amino acids for which they are auxotrophic. In that situation, the canonical amino acid residues in native proteins are substituted with the ncAAs. Even the insertion of multiple different ncAAs into the same protein is possible. Finally, the repertoire of 20 canonical amino acids can not only be expanded, but also reduced to 19. \nBy reassigning transfer RNA (tRNA)/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pairs the codon specificity can be changed. Cells endowed with such aminoacyl-[tRNA synthetases] are thus able to read [mRNA] sequences that make no sense to the existing gene expression machinery. Altering the codon: tRNA synthetases pairs may lead to the in vivo incorporation of the non-canonical amino acids into proteins.\nIn the past reassigning codons was mainly done on a limited scale. In 2013, however, Farren Isaacs and George Church at Harvard University reported the replacement of all 321 TAG stop codons present in the genome of \"E. coli\" with synonymous TAA codons, thereby demonstrating that massive substitutions can be combined into higher-order strains without lethal effects. Following the success of this genome wide codon replacement, the authors continued and achieved the reprogramming of 13 codons throughout the genome, directly affecting 42 essential genes.\n\nAn even more radical change in the genetic code is the change of a triplet codon to a quadruplet and even pentaplet codon pioneered by Sisido in cell-free systems and by Schultz in bacteria. Finally, non-natural base pairs can be used to introduce novel amino acid in proteins.\n\nThe goal of substituting DNA by XNA may also be reached by another route, namely by engineering the environment instead of the genetic modules. This approach has been successfully demonstrated by Marlière and Mutzel with the production of an \"E. coli\" strain whose DNA is composed of standard A, C and G nucleotides but has the synthetic thymine analogue 5-chlorouracil instead of thymine (T) in the corresponding positions of the sequence. These cells are then dependent on externally supplied 5-chlorouracil for growth, but otherwise they look and behave as normal \"E. coli\". These cells, however, are currently not yet fully auxotrophic for the Xeno-base since they are still growing on thymine when this is supplied to the medium.\n\nXenobiological systems are designed to convey orthogonality to natural biological systems. A (still hypothetical) organism that uses XNA, different base pairs and polymerases and has an altered genetic code will hardly be able to interact with natural forms of life on the genetic level. Thus, these xenobiological organisms represent a genetic enclave that cannot exchange information with natural cells. Altering the genetic machinery of the cell leads to semantic containment. In analogy to information processing in IT, this safety concept is termed a “genetic firewall”. The concept of the genetic firewall seems to overcome a number of limitations of previous safety systems. A first experimental evidence of the theoretical concept of the genetic firewall was achieved in 2013 with the construction of a genomically recoded organism (GRO). In this GRO all known UAG stop codons in E.coli were replaced by UAA codons, which allowed for the deletion of release factor 1 and reassignment of UAG translation function. The GRO exhibited increased resistance to T7 bacteriophage, thus showing that alternative genetic codes do reduce genetic compatibility. This GRO, however, is still very similar to its natural “parent” and cannot be regarded as a genetic firewall. The possibility of reassigning the function of large number of triplets opens the perspective to have strains that combine XNA, novel base pairs, new genetic codes, etc. that cannot exchange any information with the natural biological world. \nRegardless of changes leading to a semantic containment mechanism in new organisms, any novel biochemical systems still has to undergo a toxicological screening. XNA, novel proteins, etc. might represent novel toxins, or have an allergic potential that needs to be assessed.\n\nXenobiology might challenge the regulatory framework, as currently laws and directives deal with genetically modified organisms and do not directly mention chemically or genomically modified organisms. Taking into account that real xenobiology organisms are not expected in the next few years, policy makers do have some time at hand to prepare themselves for an upcoming governance challenge. Since 2012, the following groups have picked up the topic as a developing governance issue: policy advisers in the US, four National Biosafety Boards in Europe, the European Molecular Biology Organisation, and the European Commission's Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) in three opinions (Definition, Risk assessment methodologies and safety aspects, and Risks to the environment and biodiversity related to synthetic biology and research priorities in the field of synthetic biology ).\n\n"}
