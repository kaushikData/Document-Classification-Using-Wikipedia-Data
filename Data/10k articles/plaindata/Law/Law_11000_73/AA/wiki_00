Instead, they simply file a motion or application with the state supreme court, board of bar examiners, or state bar association of the other jurisdiction, which typically must be accompanied by certificates of good standing from all other jurisdictions in which they are admitted and sufficient personal information to facilitate a background check of good moral character. \n\nIn August 2012, the American Bar Association's Ethics 20/20 Commission published a report urging expansion of admission on motion, which noted that 40 jurisdictions (39 states and the District of Columbia) have already adopted it, and 11 states have not.\n\nAll jurisdictions that grant admission by motion require the applicant to show that they were admitted to the practice of law in another jurisdiction and actually practiced there for a certain period of time (typically three to seven years), to prevent law school graduates from abusing this privilege to bypass bar examinations in states perceived as more difficult. Furthermore, many states only provide for admission on motion based on either an express reciprocal agreement or \"de facto\" reciprocity; that is, only if the applicant's home jurisdiction grants their own attorneys the same privilege. \n\nSome U.S. jurisdictions, such as Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia, will allow admission on motion of an attorney licensed in any state in lieu of taking their own bar examination, without the need to show reciprocity. \n\nSome states such as California, Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina do not allow reciprocity or admission by motion for attorneys licensed in any other jurisdiction. \n\n"}

{"id": "4012", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4012", "title": "Basel Convention", "text": "Basel Convention\n\nThe Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal, usually known as the Basel Convention, is an international treaty that was designed to reduce the movements of hazardous waste between nations, and specifically to prevent transfer of hazardous waste from developed to less developed countries (LDCs). It does not, however, address the movement of radioactive waste. The Convention is also intended to minimize the amount and toxicity of wastes generated, to ensure their environmentally sound management as closely as possible to the source of generation, and to assist LDCs in environmentally sound management of the hazardous and other wastes they generate.\n\nThe Convention was opened for signature on 22 March 1989, and entered into force on 5 May 1992. As of October 2018, 186 states and the European Union are parties to the Convention. Haiti and the United States have signed the Convention but not ratified it.\n\nWith the tightening of environmental laws (for example, RCRA) in developed nations in the 1970s, disposal costs for hazardous waste rose dramatically. At the same time, globalization of shipping made transboundary movement of waste more accessible, and many LDCs were desperate for foreign currency. Consequently, the trade in hazardous waste, particularly to LDCs, grew rapidly.\n\nOne of the incidents which led to the creation of the Basel Convention was the \"Khian Sea\" waste disposal incident, in which a ship carrying incinerator ash from the city of Philadelphia in the United States dumped half of its load on a beach in Haiti before being forced away. It sailed for many months, changing its name several times. Unable to unload the cargo in any port, the crew was believed to have dumped much of it at sea.\n\nAnother is the 1988 Koko case in which five ships transported 8,000 barrels of hazardous waste from Italy to the small town of Koko in Nigeria in exchange for $100 monthly rent which was paid to a Nigerian for the use of his farmland.\n\nThese practices have been deemed \"Toxic Colonialism\" by many developing countries.\n\nAt its most recent meeting, 27 November to 1 December 2006, the Conference of the parties of the Basel Agreement focused on issues of electronic waste and the dismantling of ships.\n\nAccording to Maureen Walsh, only around 4% of hazardous wastes that come from OECD countries are actually shipped across international borders. These wastes include, among others, chemical waste, radioactive waste, municipal solid waste, asbestos, incinerator ash, and old tires. Of internationally shipped waste that comes from developed countries, more than half is shipped for recovery and the remainder for final disposal.\n\nIncreased trade in recyclable materials has led to an increase in a market for used products such as computers. This market is valued in billions of dollars. At issue is the distinction when used computers stop being a \"commodity\" and become a \"waste\".\n\nAs of October 2018, there are 187 parties to the treaty, which includes 184 UN member states, the Cook Islands, the European Union, and the State of Palestine. The nine UN member states that are not party to the treaty are East Timor, Fiji, Grenada, Haiti, San Marino, Solomon Islands, South Sudan, Tuvalu, and United States.\n\nA waste falls under the scope of the Convention if it is within the category of wastes listed in Annex I of the Convention and it exhibits one of the hazardous characteristics contained in Annex III. \nIn other words, it must both be listed and possess a characteristic such as being explosive, flammable, toxic, or corrosive. The other way that a waste may fall under the scope of the Convention is if it is defined as or considered to be a hazardous waste under the laws of either the exporting country, the importing country, or any of the countries of transit.\n\nThe definition of the term disposal is made in Article 2 al 4 and just refers to annex IV, which gives a list of operations which are understood as disposal or recovery. The examples of disposal are broad and include also recovery, recycling.\n\nAlternatively, to fall under the scope of the Convention, it is sufficient for waste to be included in Annex II, which lists other wastes, such as household wastes and residue that comes from incinerating household waste.\n\nRadioactive waste that is covered under other international control systems and wastes from the normal operation of ships are not covered.\n\nAnnex IX attempts to define \"commodities\" which are not considered wastes and which would be excluded.\n\nIn addition to conditions on the import and export of the above wastes, there are stringent requirements for notice, consent and tracking for movement of wastes across national boundaries. It is of note that the Convention places a general prohibition on the exportation or importation of wastes between Parties and non-Parties. The exception to this rule is where the waste is subject to another treaty that does not take away from the Basel Convention. The United States is a notable non-Party to the Convention and has a number of such agreements for allowing the shipping of hazardous wastes to Basel Party countries.\n\nThe OECD Council also has its own control system that governs the trans-boundary movement of hazardous materials between OECD member countries. This allows, among other things, the OECD countries to continue trading in wastes with countries like the United States that have not ratified the Basel Convention.\n\nParties to the Convention must honor import bans of other Parties.\n\nArticle 4 of the Basel Convention calls for an overall reduction of waste generation. By encouraging countries to keep wastes within their boundaries and as close as possible to its source of generation, the internal pressures should provide incentives for waste reduction and pollution prevention. Parties are generally prohibited from exporting covered wastes to, or import covered waste from, non-parties to the convention.\n\nThe Convention states that illegal hazardous waste traffic is criminal but contains no enforcement provisions.\n\nAccording to Article 12, Parties are directed to adopt a protocol that establishes liability rules and procedures that are appropriate for damage that comes from the movement of hazardous waste across borders.\n\nCurrent consensus is that as space is not classed as a \"country\" under the specific definition, export of e-waste to non terrestrial locations would not be covered. This has been suggested (somewhat laughably) as a way to deal with the \"Fridge Mountain\" and related deposits of waste in the UK and elsewhere in the event of a way to cheaply access space such as an orbital tether being built.\n\nAfter the initial adoption of the Convention, some least developed countries and environmental organizations argued that it did not go far enough. Many nations and NGOs argued for a total ban on shipment of all hazardous waste to LDCs. In particular, the original Convention did not prohibit waste exports to any location except Antarctica but merely required a notification and consent system known as \"prior informed consent\" or PIC. Further, many waste traders sought to exploit the good name of recycling and begin to justify all exports as moving to recycling destinations. Many believed a full ban was needed including exports for recycling. These concerns led to several regional waste trade bans, including the Bamako Convention.\n\nLobbying at 1995 Basel conference by LDCs, Greenpeace and several European countries such as Denmark, led to the adoption of an amendment to the convention in 1995 termed the Basel Ban Amendment to the Basel Convention. The amendment has been accepted by 86 countries and the European Union, but has not entered into force (as that requires ratification by 3/4 of the member states to the Convention). The Amendment prohibits the export of hazardous waste from a list of developed (mostly OECD) countries to developing countries. The Basel Ban applies to export for any reason, including recycling. An area of special concern for advocates of the Amendment was the sale of ships for salvage, shipbreaking. The Ban Amendment was strenuously opposed by a number of industry groups as well as nations including Australia and Canada. The number of ratification for the entry-into force of the Ban Amendment is under debate: Amendments to the convention enter into force after ratification of \"three-fourths of the Parties who accepted them\" [Art. 17.5]; so far, the Parties of the Basel Convention could not yet agree whether this would be three fourth of the Parties that were Party to the Basel Convention when the Ban was adopted, or three fourth of the current Parties of the Convention[see Report of COP 9 of the Basel Convention]. The status of the amendment ratifications can be found on the Basel Secretariat's web page. The European Union fully implemented the Basel Ban in its Waste Shipment Regulation (EWSR), making it legally binding in all EU member states. Norway and Switzerland have similarly fully implemented the Basel Ban in their legislation.\n\nIn the light of the blockage concerning the entry into force of the Ban amendment, Switzerland and Indonesia have launched a \"Country-led Initiative\" (CLI) to discuss in an informal manner a way forward to ensure that the trans boundary movements of hazardous wastes, especially to developing countries and countries with economies in the transition, do not lead to an unsound management of hazardous wastes. This discussion aims at identifying and finding solutions to the reasons why hazardous wastes are still brought to countries that are not able to treat them in a safe manner. It is hoped that the CLI will contribute to the realization of the objectives of the Ban Amendment. The Basel Convention's website informs about the progress of this initiative.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "438653", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=438653", "title": "Billy Budd", "text": "Billy Budd\n\nBilly Budd, Sailor is the final novel by American writer Herman Melville, first published posthumously in London in 1924 as edited by Raymond M. Weaver, a professor at Columbia University. Other versions were later published. Melville had begun writing the original work in November 1888, but left it unfinished at his death in 1891. Acclaimed by British critics as a masterpiece when published in London, it quickly took its place as a classic literary work in the United States.\n\nThe novella was discovered in manuscript form in 1919 by Weaver, who was studying Melville's papers as his first biographer. Melville's widow had begun to edit the manuscript, but had not been able to decide her husband's intentions at several key points or even to see his intended title. Poor transcription and misinterpretation of Melville's notes marred the first published versions of the text. After several years of study, Harrison Hayford and Merton M. Sealts, Jr. published what was considered the best transcription and critical reading text in 1962. In 2017, the Northwestern University Press published a \"new reading text\" based on a \"corrected version\" of the genetic text prepared by G. Thomas Tanselle.\n\nThe novella was adapted as a stage play in 1951 by Louis O. Coxe and Robert Chapman and produced on Broadway, where it won the Donaldson Awards and Outer Critics Circle Awards for best play. Benjamin Britten adapted it as an opera by the same name, first performed in December 1951.\n\nThe play was adapted into a film in 1962, produced, directed, co-written, and starring Peter Ustinov with Terence Stamp receiving an Academy Award nomination in his film debut.\n\nBilly Budd is a seaman impressed into service aboard HMS \"Bellipotent\" in the year 1797, when the Royal Navy was reeling from two major mutinies and was threatened by the 's military ambitions. He is impressed to this large warship from another, smaller, merchant ship, \"The Rights of Man\" (named after the book by Thomas Paine). As his former ship moves off, Budd shouts, \"Good-bye to you too, old \"Rights-of-Man\".\"\n\nBilly, a foundling from Bristol, has an innocence, good looks and a natural charisma that make him popular with the crew. His only physical defect is a stutter which grows worse when under intense emotion. He arouses the antagonism of the ship's master-at-arms, John Claggart. Claggart, while not unattractive, seems somehow \"defective or abnormal in the constitution\", possessing a \"natural depravity.\" Envy is Claggart's explicitly stated emotion toward Budd, foremost because of his \"significant personal beauty,\" and also for his innocence and general popularity. (Melville further opines that envy is \"universally felt to be more shameful than even felonious crime.\") This leads Claggart to falsely charge Billy with conspiracy to mutiny. When the captain, Edward Fairfax \"Starry\" Vere, is presented with Claggart's charges, he summons Claggart and Billy to his cabin for a private meeting. Claggart makes his case and Billy, astounded, is unable to respond, due to his stutter. In his extreme frustration he strikes out at Claggart, killing him instantly.\n\nVere convenes a drumhead court-martial. He acts as convening authority, prosecutor, defense counsel and sole witness (except for Billy). He intervenes in the deliberations of the court-martial panel to persuade them to convict Billy, despite their and his beliefs in Billy's moral innocence. (Vere says in the moments following Claggart's death, \"Struck dead by an angel of God! Yet the angel must hang!\") Vere claims to be following the letter of the Mutiny Act and the Articles of War.\n\nAlthough Vere and the other officers do not believe Claggart's charge of conspiracy and think Billy justified in his response, they find that their own opinions matter little. The martial law in effect states that during wartime the blow itself, fatal or not, is a capital crime. The court-martial convicts Billy following Vere's argument that any appearance of weakness in the officers and failure to enforce discipline could stir more mutiny throughout the British fleet. Condemned to be hanged the morning after his attack on Claggart, Billy before his execution says, \"God bless Captain Vere!\" His words were repeated by the gathered crew in a \"resonant and sympathetic echo.\"\n\nThe novel closes with three chapters that present ambiguity:\n\nCreated slowly over the last five years of his life, the novella \"Billy Budd\" represents Melville's return to prose fiction after three decades when he wrote only poetry. He started it as a poem, a ballad entitled \"Billy in the Darbies\", which he intended to include in his book, \"John Marr and Other Sailors\". Melville composed a short, prose head-note to introduce the speaker and set the scene. The character of \"Billy\" in this early version was an older man condemned for inciting mutiny and apparently guilty as charged. He did not include the poem in his published book. Melville incorporated the ballad and expanded the head-note sketch into a story that eventually reached 150 manuscript pages. This was the first of what were to be three major expansions, each related to one of the principal characters.\n\nMelville had a difficult time writing, describing his process with \"Moby-Dick\" as follows: \"Taking a book off the brain is akin to the ticklish & dangerous business of taking an old painting off a panel—you have to scrape off the whole business in order to get at it with safety.\"\nThe \"scrapings\" of \"Billy Budd\" lie in the 351 leaves of manuscript now in the Houghton Library at Harvard University.\n\nThe state of this manuscript has been described as \"chaotic,\" with a bewildering array of corrections, cancellations, cut and pasted leaves, annotations inscribed by several hands, and with at least two different attempts made at a fair copy. The composition proceeded in three general phases, as shown by the Melville scholars Harrison Hayford and Merton M. Sealts, Jr., who did an extensive study of the original papers from 1953 to 1962.\nAfter Melville's death, his wife Elizabeth, who had acted as his amanuensis on other projects, scribbled notes and conjectures, corrected spelling, sorted leaves and, in some instances, wrote over her husband's faint writing. She tried to follow through on what she perceived as her husband's objectives but her editing was confusing to the first professional editors, Weaver and Freeman, who mistook her writing for Melville's. At some point Elizabeth Melville placed the manuscript in \"a japanned tin box\" with the author's other literary materials, and it remained undiscovered for another 28 years.\n\nIn August 1918, Raymond M. Weaver, a professor at Columbia University, doing research for what would become the first biography of Melville, paid a visit to Melville's granddaughter, Eleanor Melville Metcalf, at her South Orange, New Jersey home. She gave him access to all the records of Melville which survived in the family: manuscripts, letters, journals, annotated books, photographs, and a variety of other material. Among these papers, Weaver was astonished to find a substantial manuscript for an unknown prose work entitled \"Billy Budd.\"\n\nAfter producing a text that would later be described as \"hastily transcribed\", he published the first edition of the work in 1924 as \"Billy Budd, Foretopman\" in Volume XIII of the Standard Edition of Melville's \"Complete Works\" (London: Constable and Company). In 1928 he published another version of the text which, despite numerous variations, may be considered essentially the same text.\n\nF. Barron Freeman published a second text in 1948, edited on different principles, as \"Melville's Billy Budd\" (Cambridge: Harvard University Press). He believed he stayed closer to what Melville wrote, but still relied on Weaver's text, with what are now considered mistaken assumptions and textual errors. Subsequent editions of \"Billy Budd\" up through the early 1960s are, strictly speaking, versions of one or the other of these two basic texts.\n\nAfter several years of study, in 1962, Harrison Hayford and Merton M. Sealts, Jr., established what is now considered the correct, authoritative text. It was published by the University of Chicago Press, and contains both a \"reading\" and a \"genetic\" text. Most editions printed since then follow the Hayford-Sealts text.\n\nBased on the confusing manuscripts, the published versions had many variations. For example, early versions gave the book's title as \"Billy Budd, Foretopman\", while it now seems clear Melville intended \"Billy Budd, Sailor: (An Inside Narrative)\"; some versions wrongly included as a preface a chapter that Melville had excised (the correct text has no preface). In addition, some early versions did not follow his change of the name of the ship to \"Bellipotent\" (from the Latin \"bellum\" war and \"potens\" powerful), from \"Indomitable\", as Melville called it in an earlier draft. It is unclear of his full intentions in changing the name of the ship since he used the name \"Bellipotent\" only six times.\n\nThe book has undergone a number of substantial, critical reevaluations in the years since its discovery. Raymond Weaver, its first editor, was initially unimpressed and described it as \"not distinguished\". After its publication debut in England, and with critics of such caliber as D. H. Lawrence and John Middleton Murry hailing it as a masterpiece, Weaver changed his mind. In the introduction to its second edition in the 1928 \"Shorter Novels of Herman Melville\", he declared: \"In \"Pierre\", Melville had hurled himself into a fury of vituperation against the world; with \"Billy Budd\" he would justify the ways of God to man.\"\n\nIn mid-1924 Murry orchestrated the reception of \"Billy Budd, Foretopman,\" first in London, in the influential \"Times Literary Supplement,\" in an essay called \"Herman Melville's Silence\" (July 10, 1924), then in a reprinting of the essay, slightly expanded, in the \"New York Times Book Review\" (August 10, 1924). In relatively short order he and several other influential British literati had managed to canonize \"Billy Budd\", placing it alongside \"Moby-Dick\" as one of the great books of Western literature. Wholly unknown to the public until 1924, \"Billy Budd\" by 1926 had joint billing with the book that had just recently been firmly established as a literary masterpiece. In its first text and subsequent texts, and as read by different audiences, the book has kept that high status ever since.\n\nIn 1990 the Melville biographer and scholar Hershel Parker pointed out that all the early estimations of \"Billy Budd\" were based on readings from the flawed transcription texts of Weaver. Some of these flaws were crucial to an understanding of Melville's intent, such as the famous \"coda\" at the end of the chapter containing the news account of the death of the \"admirable\" John Claggart and the \"depraved\" William Budd (25 in Weaver, 29 in Hayford & Sealts reading text, 344Ba in the genetic text) :\n\n\"Weaver\": \"Here ends a story not unwarranted by what happens in this incongruous world of ours—innocence and 'infirmary', spiritual depravity and fair 'respite'.\"\n\n\"The Ms\": \"Here ends a story not unwarranted by what happens in this {\"word undeciphered\"} world of ours—innocence and 'infamy', spiritual depravity and fair 'repute'.\"\n\nMelville had written this as an end-note after his second major revision. When he enlarged the book with the third major section, developing Captain Vere, he deleted the end-note, as it no longer applied to the expanded story. Many of the early readers, such as Murry and Freeman, thought this passage was a foundational statement of Melville's philosophical views on life. Parker wonders what they could possibly have understood from the passage as written.\n\nHershel Parker agrees that \"masterpiece\" is an appropriate description of the book, but he adds a proviso. Examining the history and reputation of \"Billy Budd\" has left me more convinced than before that it deserves high stature (although not precisely the high stature it holds, whatever that stature is) and more convinced that it is a wonderfully teachable story—as long as it is not taught as a finished, complete, coherent, and totally interpretable work of art. Given this unfinished quality and Melville's reluctance to present clear lessons, the range of critical response is not surprising.\n\nSome critics have interpreted \"Billy Budd\" as a historical novel that attempts to evaluate man's relation to the past. Thomas J. Scorza has written about the philosophical framework of the story. He understands the work as a comment on the historical feud between poets and philosophers. By this interpretation, Melville is opposing the scientific, rational systems of thought, which Claggart's character represents, in favor of the more comprehensive poetic pursuit of knowledge embodied by Billy.\n\nIn her book \"Epistemology of the Closet\" (1990/2008), Eve Sedgwick, expanding on earlier interpretations of the same themes, posits that the interrelationships between Billy, Claggart and Captain Vere are representations of male homosexual desire and the mechanisms of prohibition against this desire. She points out that Claggart's \"natural depravity,\" which is defined tautologically as \"depravity according to nature,\" and the accumulation of equivocal terms (\"phenomenal\", \"mystery\", etc.) used in the explanation of the fault in his character, are an indication of his status as the central homosexual figure in the text. She also interprets the mutiny scare aboard the \"Bellipotent\", the political circumstances that are at the center of the events of the story, as a portrayal of homophobia.\n\nMelville's dramatic presentation of the contradiction between the requirements of the law and the needs of humanity made the novella an \"iconic text\" in the field of law and literature. Earlier readers viewed Captain Vere as good man trapped by bad law. Richard Weisberg, who holds degrees in both comparative literature and law, argued that Vere was wrong to play the roles of witness, prosecutor, judge and executioner, and that he went beyond the law when he sentenced Billy to immediate hanging. Based on his study of statutory law and practices in the Royal Navy in the era in which the book takes place, Weisberg argues that Vere deliberately distorted the applicable substantive and procedural law to bring about Billy's death. Judge Richard Posner has sharply criticized these claims. He objects to ascribing literary significance to legal errors that are not part of the imagined world of Melville's fiction and accused Weisberg and others of calling Billy an \"innocent man\" and making light of the fact that he \"struck a lethal blow to a superior officer in wartime.\"\n\nH. Bruce Franklin sees a direct connection between the hanging of Budd and the controversy around capital punishment. While Melville was writing \"Billy Budd\" between 1886 and 1891, the public's attention was focused on the issue. Other commentators have suggested that the story may have been based on events on board USS \"Somers\", an American naval vessel; Lt. Guert Gansevoort, a defendant in a later investigation, was a first cousin of Melville. If so then the character Billy Budd was likely inspired by a young man named Philip Spencer who was hanged on USS \"Somers\" on December 1, 1842.\n\nHarold Schechter, a professor who has written a number of books on American serial killers, has said that the author's description of Claggart could be considered to be a definition of a sociopath. He acknowledges that Melville was writing at a time before the word \"sociopath\" was used. Dr. Robert Hare might classify Claggart as a psychopath, since his personality did not demonstrate the traits of a sociopath (rule-breaking) but of grandiosity, conning manipulation and a lack of empathy or remorse.\n\nThe centrality of Billy Budd's extraordinary good looks in the novella, where he is described by Captain Vere as \"the young fellow who seems so popular with the men—Billy, the Handsome Sailor\", have led to interpretations of a homoerotic sensibility in the novel. Laura Mulvey added a theory of scopophilia and masculine and feminine subjectivity/objectivity. This version tends to inform interpretations of Britten's opera, perhaps owing to the composer's own homosexuality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdaptations for cinema and television:\n"}

Synar, 478 U.S. 714 (1986), was a United States Supreme Court case that struck down the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act as an unconstitutional usurpation of executive power by Congress because the law empowered Congress to terminate the United States Comptroller General for certain specified reasons, including \"inefficiency, 'neglect of duty,' or 'malfeasance.'\" The named defendant in the original case was Comptroller General Charles Arthur Bowsher and the constitutional challenge was brought forth by Oklahoma Congressman Mike Synar.\n\nUnder the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, allowable deficit levels were calculated in consideration of the eventual elimination of the federal deficit. If the budget exceeded the allowable deficit, across-the-board cuts were required. Directors of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) were required to report to the Comptroller General regarding their recommendations for how much must be cut. The Comptroller General then evaluated these reports, made his own conclusion, and gave a recommendation to the President, who was then required to issue an order effecting the reductions recommended by the Comptroller General unless Congress made the cuts in other ways within a specified amount of time.\n\nThe Comptroller General is nominated by the President from a list of three people recommended by the presiding officers of the House and Senate. He is removable only by impeachment or a joint resolution of Congress, which requires majority votes in both houses and is subject to a Presidential veto. Congress can give a number of reasons for this removal, including \"inefficiency,\" \"neglect of duty,\" or \"malfeasance\".\n\nThe Congress cannot control how its laws are executed. Since it does not possess this power, it cannot delegate it to its agents. The Comptroller General is an agent of Congress because he can be removed by Congress via a process other than impeachment. The Comptroller General exercises executive power and so the Act is unconstitutional.\n\nThe Comptroller General's function under the Act is the \"very essence\" of the execution of the laws since (1) it entails interpreting the Act to determine precisely what kind of budgetary calculations are required and (2) the Comptroller General commands the President to carry out, without variation, his directive regarding the budget resolutions. Once Congress passes legislation, it can influence only its execution by passing new laws or through impeachment.\n\nThe Constitution provides Congress the power to remove executive officers only by impeachment. Also, the Constitutional Convention explicitly rejected language that would have permitted impeachment for \"maladministration,\" with Madison arguing that \"so vague a term will be equivalent to a tenure during pleasure of the Senate\". Thus, Congress can remove a member of the executive branch only through impeachment.\n\nJustice White's dissent argued that the act should have been upheld. Determining the level of spending by the federal government is a legislative function, not an executive one, he argued. Even if the power were executive, White did not see anything wrong with delegating that power to an agent as long as Congress could influence him only by a means that is subject to the Presentment and Bicameralism Clause requirements, which the act satisfied, since the Comptroller General could be influenced by Congress only through a joint resolution.\n\n"}

According to author Robert Tönnis \"The term brand piracy is unauthorized usage of protected brand names, labels, designs or description of trade\". Annika Kristin states \"brand Piracy is considered to be the premeditated use of registered trademark, its name, its tradename or the packaging and presentation of its products\". It is a major loss to MNE's around the world as it causes a loss of revenue and image of the brand. \nTönnis describes the consequence of brand piracy as the consumption of fake, untested and poor quality goods by consumers. This can damage the reputation of brands and even result in damage to people's health. \nIn 2012 the CBP promised to protect the economy, the people of the USA and their national security \"against harm from counterfeit and pirated goods\".\n\nExamples for imitation and counterfeiting of branded products have been noted as early as 1912. \n\n\nWhile some experts suggest the company to go the extremes of punishing the counterfeiter, others also suggest takeover or franchisee agreements with them. Some other authors suggest web based web crawlers that can identify and delete any promotional material that infringes with the product of the company. Some authors suggest recourse to legal action and a study of legal protections available in those markets where Piracy is prevalent. Since 1977 obvious plagiarism in regards to established design is also exposed in public by awarding the negative prize Plagiarius.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "845537", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=845537", "title": "Breach of the peace", "text": "Breach of the peace\n\nBreach of the peace, or disturbing the peace, is a legal term used in constitutional law in English-speaking countries, and in a wider public order sense in the several jurisdictions of the United Kingdom. It is a form of disorderly conduct.\n\nDisturbing the peace is a crime generally defined as the unsettling of proper order in a public space through one's actions. This can include creating loud noise by fighting or challenging to fight, disturbing others by loud and unreasonable noise (including loud music), or using profanity.\n\nDisturbing the peace is typically considered a misdemeanour or an infraction depending on the jurisdiction and is often punishable by either a fine or a brief term in jail. On other rare occasions, it is considered an ordinance violation, the lowest level of offence. In most Commonwealth jurisdictions, a person held in breach of the peace will not have a criminal record entered against their name, which record could otherwise hurt the person's employment prospects (often seriously) and could adversely affect how he or she is viewed and treated by law-enforcement authorities, e.g., what if any bond he or she is granted if arrested in the future.\n\nA violation of a noise ordinance is in most jurisdictions not considered a disturbance of the peace unless the perpetrator has disregarded an affirmative request that he or she reduce the noise to a reasonable level.\n\nStandards for whether to charge someone with disturbance of the peace are highly subjective, and in many jurisdictions, courts are highly deferential to the opinion of the arresting/charging officer as to whether the accused's actions violated the law (even though in theory the officer's testimony addresses only questions of fact, whereas questions of the law's applicability to those facts are left to the trying court alone). Many local ordinances prohibiting disturbance of the peace exhibit a problematic degree of vagueness, occasionally to the point that courts deem them unconstitutional (in United States law) or violative of due process (in both United States and Commonwealth jurisdictions).\n\nIn the United States, the Speech or Debate Clause of Article One of the United States Constitution provides that members of Congress shall be immune from arrest in going to and departing from sessions and while Congress is in session except for cases of \"Treason, Felony, and Breach of the Peace.\" The first two are somewhat self-explanatory; it has been suggested that the third is deliberately somewhat vague. The doctrine thus established is called \"congressional immunity\"; it arose out of the necessity to prevent a vengeful executive from arresting members of the legislature under a pretext to prevent them from taking actions that the executive might find to be displeasing. In recent years, this doctrine has been used to prevent members from being stopped and held for speeding on their way to sessions; this apparently is not a \"breach of the peace\", whereas perhaps another misdemeanour such as \"drunk and disorderly\" might be construed as such. Most states of the United States and most other English-speaking jurisdictions have extended this privilege to members of their legislatures on the theory outlined above.\n\n\"Cox v. Louisiana\" was a United States Supreme Court decision that held that a Louisiana statute criminalizing breaches of the peace \"as authoritatively interpreted by the Louisiana Supreme Court is unconstitutionally broad in scope\". The statute read in part:\n\nIn Terminiello v. City of Chicago, the Supreme Court held that a \"breach of peace\" ordinance of the City of Chicago that banned speech which \"stirs the public to anger, invites dispute, brings about a condition of unrest, or creates a disturbance\" was unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Justice Douglas stated: \"Accordingly a function of free speech under our system of government is to invite dispute. It may indeed best serve its high purpose when it induces a condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with conditions as they are, or even stirs people to anger. Speech is often provocative and challenging. It may strike at prejudices and preconceptions and have profound unsettling effects as it presses for acceptance of an idea.”\n\nIn England and Wales, theoretically all criminal offences cognizable by English law involve \"a breach of the Queen's peace\", and all indictments formerly concluded \"against the peace of our Lady the Queen, her crown and dignity\" before the passage of the Indictments Act 1915 and the Rules that formed that Act's first schedule. The conclusion has also found its way into constitutional law in many United States state constitutions, which mandate that indictments within the state end in a similar manner to the above, usually omitting the \"crown\" part or substituting \"government\". For example, New Jersey's is \"against the peace of this State, the government and dignity of the same\".\n\nHistorically that concluding phrase, now legally superfluous, represents the last trace of the process by which the royal courts assume jurisdiction over all offences, and gradually eroded the jurisdiction of the sheriff and of lords of manor and franchises, making crime a matter of national concern as distinguished from civil wrongs or infractions of the rights of local magnates. The Peace of the King was sworn on his accession or full recognition, and the jurisdiction of his courts to punish all violations of that peace was gradually asserted. The completion of this process is marked by the institution of the office of Justice of the Peace.\n\nIn England, Wales and Northern Ireland, breach of the peace is descended from the Justices of the Peace Act 1361, which refers to riotous and barratous behaviour that disturbs the peace of the King. More modern authority defines a breach of the peace as \"when a person reasonably believes harm will be caused, or is likely to be caused, to a person or in his presence to his property, or a person is in fear of being harmed through an assault, affray, riot, unlawful assembly, or some other form of disturbance\".\n\nThe breach of the peace power of arrest is provided by the common law and therefore an 'any person' power of arrest and entry both within the same definition \n\nSection 17(5) of PACE 1984 abolished all powers of a Constable to enter under the common law with the specific exception (subsection 6) when dealing with or preventing a common law breach of the peace. This \"offence\" definition and power of arrest are contained under the common law definition of \"breach of the peace\". Breach of the peace powers are unusual in the fact they originate from the laws Alfred the Great consolidated into the common law approximately 1,000 years before the modern Constable was thought up. The first legislative reference to the common law breach of the peace was under the Justice of the Peace Act 1361. As a result, when a Constable uses their breach of the peace powers, they are acting as 'any person' and not fully as sworn officer in this capacity.\n\nThe power to arrest for a breach of the peace is usually used to remove violent, potentially violent or provocative offenders (it is not necessary for the offender themselves to be physically involved in any violence) from a scene rapidly.\n\nIn England and Wales, breach of the peace is a civil proceeding (rather than a criminal offence), although the case must be proved to the criminal standard of proof, 'beyond reasonable doubt', rather than the civil standard of proof, 'on the balance of probabilities'. Sometimes the Crown Prosecution Service conduct the case on behalf of the police, but the police service is liable for any costs awarded in favour or against the prosecutor. Breach of the Peace is not an offence, in the sense that it is not punishable either by a fine or imprisonment either at statute or common law and nor do proceedings for breach of the peace give rise to any conviction. In England and Wales, constables (or other persons) are permitted to arrest a person to \"prevent a further breach of the peace\" which allows for the police or the public to arrest a person before a breach of the peace has occurred. This is permitted when it is reasonable to believe should the person remain, that they would continue with their course of conduct and that a Breach of the Peace would occur.\n\nThe only immediate sanction that can be imposed by a court for breach of the peace is to bind over the offender to keep the peace: that is, justices of the peace can require a person to enter into a recognizance to keep the peace. Any punishment (in the sense of a loss of freedom or permanent financial penalty) takes the form of loss of the surety if the defendant fails to keep the peace or be of good behaviour during the period for which he is bound over. The binding over itself does not amount to a conviction (but any following behaviour causing loss of the surety might well result in conviction for an associated offence). A failure to enter into a recognizance may of itself lead to a person being committed to custody under s.115(3) Magistrates' Courts Act 1980.\n\nThere are major differences between English law and Scottish law with respect to dealing with breach of the peace; unlike England and Wales where criminal penalties apply to the behaviour leading to or liable to cause a breach of the peace, it is a specific criminal offence in Scotland which is prosecuted daily in the sheriff courts and due to its common law definition it can be applied to a number of scenarios. The maximum punishment if a case is remitted to the High Court remains imprisonment for life although such severe punishment is now rarely applied, usually being associated with breaches of licence during an existing life sentence.\n\nThe Scottish law definition of a breach of the peace is \"conduct severe enough to cause alarm to ordinary people and threaten serious disturbance to the community\".\n\nA constable may arrest any person, without warrant, who commits a breach of the peace. A member of the public may not arrest a person for behaviour which amounts to no more than a breach of the peace (i.e. an arrest is not always for the offence for which someone is eventually prosecuted but can be for a more serious crime that appears to be occurring).\n\nBreach of the peace can include, but is not limited to, any riotous behaviours (which includes \"rowdiness\" or \"brawling\") and any disorderly behaviour. This behaviour need not be noisy but still of a nature that would cause concern to other people. Examples include voyeurism, persistently following someone, delivering \"threatening\" letters and \"streaking\" or \"mooning\".\n\nTo prove a breach of the peace, the most important things to prove are that someone was alarmed, annoyed or disturbed by the incident.\n\nThis offence can take place anywhere, for example, a public street or any public space.\n\nOne of the leading cases in Scottish Law is that of \"Smith v Donnelly\", a case concerning a Faslane protester.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "148565", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=148565", "title": "Charitable trust", "text": "Charitable trust\n\nA charitable trust is an irrevocable trust established for charitable purposes and, in some jurisdictions, a more specific term than \"charitable organization\". A charitable trust enjoys a varying degree of tax benefits in most countries. It also generates good will. Some important terminology in charitable trusts is the term ‘corpus’ (Latin for ‘body’) which refers to the assets with which the trust is funded and the term ‘donor’ which is the person donating assets to a charity.\n\nIn India, trusts set up for the social causes and approved by the Income Tax Department get not only exemption from payment of tax but also the donors to such trusts can deduct the amount of donation to the trust from their taxable income. The legal framework in India recognizes activities including \"relief of the poor, education, medical relief, preserving monuments and environment, and the advancement of any other object of general public utility\" as charitable purposes. Companies formed under Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013 for promoting charity also receive benefits under law including exemption from various procedural provisions of the Companies Act, either fully or in part, and are also entitled to such other exemptions that the Central Government may accord through its orders.\n\nIn the Islamic Republic of Iran religious charitable trusts, or Bonyads, make up a substantial part of the country's economy, controlling an estimated 20% of Iran's GDP. Unlike some other Muslim-majority countries, the bonyads receive large and controversial subsidies from the Iranian government.\n\nIn England and Wales, charitable trusts are a form of express trust dedicated to charitable goals. There are a variety of advantages to charitable trust status, including exemption from most forms of tax and freedom for the trustees not found in other types of English trust. To be a valid charitable trust, the organisation must demonstrate both a charitable purpose and a public benefit. Applicable charitable purposes are normally divided into four categories; trusts for the relief of poverty, trusts for the promotion of education, trusts for the promotion of religion, and all other types of trust recognised by the law, which includes trusts for the benefit of animals and trusts for the benefit of a locality. There is also a requirement that the trust's purposes benefit the public (or some section of the public), and not simply a group of private individuals.\n\nSuch trusts will be invalid in several circumstances; charitable trusts are not allowed to be run for profit, nor can they have purposes that are not charitable (unless these are ancillary to the charitable purpose). In addition, it is considered unacceptable for charitable trusts to campaign for political or legal change, although discussing political issues in a neutral manner is acceptable. Charitable trusts, as with other trusts, are administered by trustees, but there is no relationship between the trustees and the beneficiaries. This results in two things; firstly, the trustees of a charitable trust are far freer to act than other trustees and secondly, beneficiaries cannot bring a court case against the trustees. Rather, the beneficiaries are represented by the Attorney General for England and Wales as a \"parens patriae\", who appears on the part of The Crown.\n\nJurisdiction over charitable disputes is shared equally between the High Court of Justice and the Charity Commission. The Commission, the first port of call, is tasked with regulating and promoting charitable trusts, as well as providing advice and opinions to trustees on administrative matters. Where the Commission feels there has been mismanagement or maladministration, it can sanction the trustees, removing them, appointing new ones or temporarily taking the trust property itself to prevent harm being done. Where there are flaws with a charity, the High Court can administer schemes directing the function of the charity.\n\nIn the United States, many individuals use charitable trusts to leave all or a portion of their estate to charity when they die, both for philanthropic purposes and for certain tax benefits.\n\nCharitable trusts may be set up inter vivos (during a donor's life) or as a part of a trust or will at death (testamentary). There are two basic types of US charitable trusts. The first is a \"lead\" trust, wherein the charity is paid first, and the remainder, after trust termination, goes to beneficiaries, such as heirs or back to the donor. The second is a \"remainder\" trust, wherein the charity is paid last after termination of the trust, after other beneficiaries have received payments. Payments may be fixed amount, annuity trust, or a percentage of principal, which is called unitrust.\n\nCharitable remainder trusts are irrevocable structures established by a donor to provide an income stream to the income beneficiary, while the public charity or private foundation receives the remainder value when the trust terminates. These \"split interest\" trusts are defined in §664 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended and are normally tax-exempt. A section 664 trust makes its payments, either of a fixed amount (charitable remainder annuity trust §664(d)(1)(D)) or a percentage of trust principal (charitable remainder unitrust), to whomever the donor chooses to receive income. Normally, the donor may claim a charitable income tax deduction, and may not have to pay an immediate capital gains tax when the charitable remainder trust disposes of the appreciated asset and purchases other property as it diversifies its portfolio of trust property. At the end of the trust term, which may be based on either lives or a term of years, the charity receives whatever amount is left in the trust. Charitable remainder unitrusts (§664(d)(2)(D)- paying a fixed percentage) provide some flexibility in the distribution of income, and may be helpful in retirement planning, while charitable remainder annuity trusts paying a fixed dollar amount are more rigid and usually appeal to much older donors unconcerned about inflation's impact on income distributions who are using cash or marketable securities to fund the trust.\n\nParents who have a child with a disability should ensure that the inheritance they leave for their child does not affect their child's eligibility for social assistance programs. A Henson trust can be useful to ensure this.\n\nCharitable lead trusts make payments, either of a fixed amount (charitable lead annuity trust) or a percentage of trust principal (charitable lead unitrust), to charity during its term. At the end of the trust term, the remainder can either go back to the donor or to heirs named by the donor. The donor may sometimes claim a charitable income tax deduction or a gift/estate tax deduction for making a lead trust gift, depending on the type of a charitable lead trust. Generally, a non-grantor lead trust does not generate a current income tax deduction, but it eliminates the asset (or part of the asset's value) from the donor's estate.\n\nIf the trust has qualified under laws such as Internal Revenue Code section 501(c), donations to the trust may be deductible to an individual taxpayer or corporate donor.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3624071", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3624071", "title": "Common purpose", "text": "Common purpose\n\nThe doctrine of common purpose, common design, joint enterprise, or joint criminal enterprise is a common-law legal doctrine that imputes criminal liability to the participants in a criminal enterprise for all that results from that enterprise. A common application of the rule is to impute criminal liability for wounding a person to participants in a riot who knew, or were reckless as to knowing, that one of their number had a knife and might use it, despite the fact that the other participants did not have knives themselves. In England and Wales and certain other Commonwealth countries, this was the understanding of the courts until February 2016, when the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council jointly ruled in \"R v Jogee\" that it was wrong, and that nothing less than intent to assist the crime would do.\n\nThe common purpose doctrine was established in England and Wales, and later adopted in other common-law jurisdictions including Scotland, Ireland, Australia, Trinidad and Tobago, the Solomon Islands, Texas, Massachusetts, the International Criminal Court, and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.\n\nAn old example of this doctrine in English law is \"R v Swindall and Osborne\" (1846) 2 Car. & K. 230. Two cart drivers engaged in a race. One of them ran down and killed a pedestrian. It was not known which one had driven the fatal cart, but since they were encouraging each other in the race, it was irrelevant which of them had actually struck the man and both were held jointly liable. Thus the parties must share a common purpose and make it clear to each other by their actions that they are acting on their common intention, so that each member of the group assumes responsibility for the actions of the whole group. When this happens, all that flows from the execution of the plan makes them all liable. This is a question of causation, in that oblique intention will be imputed for intermediate consequences that are a necessary precondition to achieving the ultimate purpose, and liability will follow where there are accidental and unforeseen departures from the plan, so long as there is no \"novus actus interveniens\" to break the chain.\n\nUntil 2016, in cases where there is violence beyond the level anticipated, the prosecution had to prove:\nIn \"R v Jogee\" <nowiki>[2016]</nowiki> UKSC 8 the UK Supreme Court decided that (c) was wrong, and that the prosecution actually had to prove that D had intended that A would commit the offence.\n\nWhere one of the participants deliberately departs from the common purpose by doing something that was not authorised or agreed upon, that participant alone is liable for the consequences. In the situation exemplified in \"Davies v DPP\" [1954] AC 378, a group comes together for a fight or to commit a crime, and either the participant knows or does not know that one of the group has a weapon. If the person knows that there is a weapon, it is foreseeable that it might be used and the fact that the other participants do not instruct the one carrying to leave it behind means that its use must be within the scope of their intention. However, if the person does not know of the weapon, this is a deliberate departure from the common purpose and this breaks the enterprise.\n\nThe simplest form of joint enterprise to murder is two or more planning to cause death and doing so. If all the parties participated in carrying out the plan, all are liable, regardless of who actually inflicted the fatal injury. However, when there is no plan to murder and one party kills while carrying out a plan to do something else, such as a planned robbery in which the participants hope to be able to get what they want without killing anyone, but one of them in fact kills, the other participants may still be guilty of murder or manslaughter if they had the necessary \"mens rea\".\n\nIn \"R v Craig & Bentley\" (1953), Derek Bentley was hanged for the murder of a police officer, committed in the course of a burglary attempt. The murder was committed by a friend and accomplice of Bentley's, Christopher Craig, then aged 16. Bentley was convicted as a party to the murder, by English law principle of common criminal purpose \"joint enterprise\". The judge in court (Lord Chief Justice Goddard) sentenced Bentley to death based on an interpretation of the phrase \"Let him have it\" (Bentley's alleged instruction to Craig), describing Bentley as \"mentally aiding the murder of Police Constable Sidney Miles\". In 1998, Bentley received a posthumous pardon.\n\nIn \"R v Lovesey and Peterson\" (1969) 53 Cr.App. R. 461, a gang was executing a plan to overpower a jeweller and steal his more valuable stock. After the robbery, the jeweller was found dead. All were properly convicted of murder because the death was the outcome of the agreed use of violence. That this accidentally caused the jeweller's death did not prevent liability. The usual case will involve plans to commit criminal damage, burglary, rape or some other crime, and there will be no compelling inference that there must also have been a plan to kill. For the participants to be convicted of murder, the question becomes one of foresight that one of them might kill.\n\nIn \"R v Powell (Anthony) and English\" [1999] 1 AC 1, the House of Lords said that the other participants must have realised that, in the course of the joint enterprise, the primary party might kill with intent to do so or with intent to cause grievous bodily harm: with the intent necessary for murder. Thus, the Powell and English doctrine extends joint enterprise liability from the paradigm case of a plan to murder to the case of a plan to commit another offence in the course of which the possibility of a murder is foreseen (see R v Bryce. 2004).\n\nIn \"Attorney General's Reference (No. 3 of 2004)\" (2005) EWCA Crim 1882, the defendant, H, was charged with manslaughter. H had sent K and C to terrify R, knowing both that K and C would have a loaded firearm with them, and that this firearm might be fired near R to increase his fear. The Court of Appeal held that H's liability depended on the scope of the joint enterprise. On the assumed facts, there was no evidence that H foresaw that the gun would be fired and R might be injured. Rather, K's intentional act of firing the gun so as to kill or cause R grievous bodily harm was fundamentally different from the acts contemplated by H. The outcome would have been different if there had been a common design to cause some harm to R. In such a case, H would be liable for manslaughter because, albeit to frighten, he had authorised the firing of the gun: he would have realised that K might intentionally cause some harm when he fired the gun. However, on the assumed facts, H did not foresee the possibility of any harm to R, let alone intentional harm, so he was properly acquitted.\n\nIn \"R v Gnango\" <nowiki>[2011] UKSC 59</nowiki>, the Supreme Court held that D2 is guilty of the offence of murdering V if (1) D1 and D2 voluntarily engage in fighting each other, each intending to kill or cause grievous bodily harm to the other and each foreseeing that the other has the reciprocal intention, and if (2) D1 mistakenly kills V in the course of the fight. Baker argues that the case was wrongly decided because it did not rest on oblique intention, invoked joint-perpetration where there was none, invoked the \"provocative act murder doctrine where it did not apply, and overly restricted the incidental party/victim rule without seeing that it did not apply because the actual victim as opposed to the putative victim (Gnango) did not consent to being harmed.\"\n\nIn \"R v Jogee\" <nowiki>[2016] UKSC 8</nowiki>, the Supreme Court decided that intent, not mere foresight, must be proved in order to convict an accomplice of a crime of specific intent, such as murder. The court said \"foresight of what might happen is ordinarily no more than evidence from which a jury can infer the presence of a requisite intention. It may be strong evidence, but its adoption as a test for the mental element for murder in the case of a secondary party is a serious and anomalous departure from the basic rule, which results in over-extension of the law of murder.\" He summarised the law as: \"If the crime requires a particular intent, D2 must intend ... to assist D1 to act with such intent.\" (This appeal was heard jointly with an appeal from Jamaica to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, with the same judges, \"Ruddock v The Queen\" <nowiki>[2016] UKPC 7</nowiki>.)\n\nOne person who has been an active member of a group with a common purpose may escape liability by withdrawing before the other(s) go on to commit the crime. Mere repentance without any action, however, leaves the party liable. To be effective, the withdrawing party must actively seek to prevent the others from relying on what has been done. In \"R v Becerra\" (1975) 62 Crim. App. R. 212 it was held that any communication of withdrawal by the secondary party to the perpetrator must be such as to serve \"unequivocal notice\" upon the other party to the common purpose that, if he proceeds upon it, he does so without the further aid and assistance of the withdrawing party.:\nIn \"R v Rook\" (1997) Cr. App. R. 327, the court held that, as in the case of joint enterprise where both parties are present at the scene of the crime, it is not necessary for the prosecution to show that a secondary party who lends assistance or encouragement before the commission of the crime intended the victim to be killed, or to suffer serious injury, provided it was proved that he foresaw the event as a real or substantial risk and nonetheless lent his assistance.\n\nRook was convicted as one of a gang of three men who met and agreed the details of a contract killing of the wife of a fourth man on the next day. Rook did not turn up the next day and the killing was done by his two fellows. His defence was that he never intended the victim to be killed and believed that, if he failed to appear, the others would not go through with the plan. Lloyd LJ. described the evidence against him in this way:\n\nThis did not amount to an unequivocal communication of his withdrawal from the scheme contemplated at the time he gave his assistance.\n\nThe use of this doctrine has caused concern among academics and practitioners in the legal community, and has been the subject of an investigation by the House of Commons Justice Select Committee in the UK. In 2010, a campaign group was formed in the UK called JENGbA (Joint Enterprise: Not Guilty by Association), which seeks reform of the law and supports those convicted by this means. JENGbA asserts that the misapplication of the principle constitutes a form of human rights abuse.\n\nOn 6 July 2014, \"Common\", a 90-minute television drama written by Jimmy McGovern, was shown on BBC One. It examined the issues surrounding a case of joint enterprise or common unlawful purpose murder. On 7 July 2014, a documentary regarding a number of joint enterprise cases, \"Guilty by Association\", was also shown on BBC One.\n\nOne of these cases is that of Alex Henry, convicted in March 2014 at the Old Bailey alongside Janhelle Grant-Murray and Cameron Ferguson, for the murder of Taqui Khezihi and the non-fatal stabbing of Bourhane Khezihi. The court heard how Alex Henry was shopping in Ealing Broadway on a Tuesday afternoon in August 2013 with his two co-defendants. He exited the shopping centre with Ferguson to see Grant-Murray being confronted by a group of four older men who were unknown to all defendants. CCTV showed that Grant-Murray was holding a wine bottle by the neck and Bourhane Khezihi had removed his belt to use as a knuckle duster. A combination of CCTV evidence and mobile phone video footage was used to piece together the 47 second affray in which Alex Henry can be seen running into the affray and running back to the shopping centre. At trial Cameron Ferguson pleaded guilty to murder and grievous bodily harm. Alex Henry and Janhelle Grant-Murray were both found guilty by a majority verdict of 11-1. It was their presence at the scene of the spontaneous 47 second affray which was held to amount to encouragement of the stabbing. They both received a life sentence with a minimum prison term of 19 years.\n\nOn 25 February 2015, an appeal to the Court of Appeal by two convicted murderers was successful. A young man, Jonathan Fitchett, had been killed at a retail park after an altercation with Childs, who was joined by his friend Price. Although both defendants had punched the victim, an expert medical witness said that just a single punch was fatal, and it was unknown who threw the fatal punch. The Liverpool Crown Court had convicted both of murder using the device of common purpose. The Appeal Court found that there had been no intent to cause really serious injury, and that there was no evidence of \"common purpose\". The first defendant's conviction was reduced to manslaughter, and the second was reduced to affray. The Court said that for common purpose/joint enterprise to arise, there must be satisfactory evidence of a joint plan. (The absence of precise \"actus reus\" was glossed over.)\n\n\n"}

The goal is to distribute service spatially relative to end-users to provide high availability and high performance. CDNs serve a large portion of the Internet content today, including web objects (text, graphics and scripts), downloadable objects (media files, software, documents), applications (e-commerce, portals), live streaming media, on-demand streaming media, and social media sites.\n\nCDNs are a layer in the internet ecosystem. Content owners such as media companies and e-commerce vendors pay CDN operators to deliver their content to their end users. In turn, a CDN pays ISPs, carriers, and network operators for hosting its servers in their data centers.\n\nCDN is an umbrella term spanning different types of content delivery services: video streaming, software downloads, web and mobile content acceleration, licensed/managed CDN, transparent caching, and services to measure CDN performance, load balancing, multi-CDN switching and analytics and cloud intelligence. CDN vendors may cross over into other industries like security, with DDoS protection and web application firewalls (WAF), and WAN optimization. \n\nCDN nodes are usually deployed in multiple locations, often over multiple backbones. Benefits include reducing bandwidth costs, improving page load times, or increasing global availability of content. The number of nodes and servers making up a CDN varies, depending on the architecture, some reaching thousands of nodes with tens of thousands of servers on many remote points of presence (PoPs). Others build a global network and have a small number of geographical PoPs.\nRequests for content are typically algorithmically directed to nodes that are optimal in some way. When optimizing for performance, locations that are best for serving content to the user may be chosen. This may be measured by choosing locations that are the fewest hops, the least number of network seconds away from the requesting client, or the highest availability in terms of server performance (both current and historical), so as to optimize delivery across local networks. When optimizing for cost, locations that are least expensive may be chosen instead. In an optimal scenario, these two goals tend to align, as edge servers that are close to the end-user at the edge of the network may have an advantage in performance or cost.\n\nMost CDN providers will provide their services over a varying, defined, set of PoPs, depending on the coverage desired, such as United States, International or Global, Asia-Pacific, etc. These sets of PoPs can be called \"edges\", \"edge nodes\" or \"edge networks\" as they would be the closest edge of CDN assets to the end user.\n\nThe CDN's Edge Network grows outward from the origins through further acquisitions (via purchase, peering, or exchange) of co-locations facilities, bandwidth, and servers.\n\nThe Internet was designed according to the end-to-end principle. This principle keeps the core network relatively simple and moves the intelligence as much as possible to the network end-points: the hosts and clients. As a result, the core network is specialized, simplified, and optimized to only forward data packets.\nContent Delivery Networks augment the end-to-end transport network by distributing on it a variety of intelligent applications employing techniques designed to optimize content delivery. The resulting tightly integrated overlay uses web caching, server-load balancing, request routing, and content services.\nThese techniques are briefly described below.\n\nWeb caches store popular content on servers that have the greatest demand for the content requested. These shared network appliances reduce bandwidth requirements, reduce server load, and improve the client response times for content stored in the cache. Web caches are populated based on requests from users (pull caching) or based on preloaded content disseminated from content servers (push caching).\n\nServer-load balancing uses one or more techniques including service-based (global load balancing) or hardware-based, i.e. layer 4–7 switches, also known as a web switch, content switch, or multilayer switch to share traffic among a number of servers or web caches. Here the switch is assigned a single virtual IP address. Traffic arriving at the switch is then directed to one of the real web servers attached to the switch. This has the advantage of balancing load, increasing total capacity, improving scalability, and providing increased reliability by redistributing the load of a failed web server and providing server health checks.\n\nA content cluster or service node can be formed using a layer 4–7 switch to balance load across a number of servers or a number of web caches within the network.\n\nRequest routing directs client requests to the content source best able to serve the request. This may involve directing a client request to the service node that is closest to the client, or to the one with the most capacity. A variety of algorithms are used to route the request. These include Global Server Load Balancing, DNS-based request routing, Dynamic metafile generation, HTML rewriting, and anycasting. Proximity—choosing the closest service node—is estimated using a variety of techniques including reactive probing, proactive probing, and connection monitoring.\n\nCDNs use a variety of methods of content delivery including, but not limited to, manual asset copying, active web caches, and global hardware load balancers.\n\nSeveral protocol suites are designed to provide access to a wide variety of content services distributed throughout a content network. The Internet Content Adaptation Protocol (ICAP) was developed in the late 1990s to provide an open standard for connecting application servers. A more recently defined and robust solution is provided by the Open Pluggable Edge Services (OPES) protocol. This architecture defines OPES service applications that can reside on the OPES processor itself or be executed remotely on a Callout Server. Edge Side Includes or ESI is a small markup language for edge level dynamic web content assembly. It is fairly common for websites to have generated content. It could be because of changing content like catalogs or forums, or because of the personalization. This creates a problem for caching systems. To overcome this problem, a group of companies created ESI.\n\nIn \"peer-to-peer (P2P)\" content-delivery networks, clients provide resources as well as use them. This means that unlike client-server systems, the content centric networks can actually perform better as more users begin to access the content (especially with protocols such as Bittorrent that require users to share). This property is one of the major advantages of using P2P networks because it makes the setup and running costs very small for the original content distributor.\n\nIf content owners are not satisfied with the options or costs of a commercial CDN service, they can create their own CDN. This is called a private CDN. A private CDN consists of POPs (points of presence) that are only serving content for their owner. These POPs can be caching servers, reverse proxies or application delivery controllers. It can be as simple as two caching servers, or large enough to serve petabytes of content.\n\nLarge content distribution networks may even build and set up their own private network to distribute copies of content across cache locations. Such private networks are usually used in conjunction with public networks as a backup option in case the capacity of private network is not enough or there is a failure which leads to capacity reduction. Since the same content has to be distributed across many locations, a variety of multicasting techniques may be used to reduce bandwidth consumption. Over private networks, it has also been proposed to select multicast trees according to network load conditions to more efficiently utilize available network capacity.\n\nThe rapid growth of streaming video traffic uses large capital expenditures by broadband providers in order to meet this demand and to retain subscribers by delivering a sufficiently good quality of experience.\n\nTo address this, telecommunications service providers (TSPs) have begun to launch their own content delivery networks as a means to lessen the demands on the network backbone and to reduce infrastructure investments.\n\nBecause they own the networks over which video content is transmitted, telco CDNs have advantages over traditional CDNs.\n\nThey own the last mile and can deliver content closer to the end user because it can be cached deep in their networks. This deep caching minimizes the distance that video data travels over the general Internet and delivers it more quickly and reliably.\n\nTelco CDNs also have a built-in cost advantage since traditional CDNs must lease bandwidth from them and build the operator’s margin into their own cost model.\n\nIn addition, by operating their own content delivery infrastructure, telco operators have a better control over the utilization of their resources. Content management operations performed by CDNs are usually applied without (or with very limited) information about the network (e.g., topology, utilization etc.) of the telco-operators with which they interact or have business relationships. These pose a number of challenges for the telco-operators which have a limited sphere of actions in face of the impact of these operations on the utilization of their resources.\n\nIn contrast, the deployment of telco-CDNs allow operators to implement their own content management operations, which enables them to have better control over the utilization of their resources and, as such, provide better quality of service and experience to their end users.\n\nIn June 2011, StreamingMedia.com reported that a group of TSPs had founded an Operator Carrier Exchange (OCX) to interconnect their networks and compete more directly against large traditional CDNs like Akamai and Limelight Networks, which have extensive PoPs worldwide. This way, telcos are building a Federated CDN offering, which is more interesting for a content provider willing to deliver its content to the aggregated audience of this federation.\n\nIt is likely that in a near future, other telco CDN federations will be created. They will grow by enrollment of new telcos joining the federation and bringing network presence and their Internet subscriber bases to the existing ones.\n\nIn August 2011, a global consortium of leading Internet service providers led by Google announced their official implementation of the edns-client-subnet IETF Internet-Draft, which is intended to accurately localize DNS resolution responses. The initiative involves a limited number of leading DNS and CDN service providers. With the edns-client-subnet EDNS0 option, the recursive DNS servers of CDNs will utilize the IP address of the requesting client subnet when resolving DNS requests. If a CDN relies on the IP address of the DNS resolver instead of the client when resolving DNS requests, it can incorrectly geo-locate a client if the client is using Google anycast addresses for their DNS resolver, which can create latency problems. Initially, Google's 8.8.8.8 DNS addresses geo-located to California, potentially far from the location of the requesting client, but now the Google Public DNS servers are available worldwide.\n\n\nGenerally speaking, all Internet service providers can provide a content delivery network.\n\n\n"}

This placed much of the monarchs juridical power in the hands of the elected szlachta deputies, further strengthening the nobility class. In 1581 the Crown Tribunal was joined by a counterpart in Lithuania, the Lithuanian Tribunal (\"Trybunał Litewski\").\n\nTribunal consisted of 27 secular deputies elected from nobility (szlachta) each year during the sessions of local parliaments (sejmiks) and 6 ecclesiastical deputies who were elected by their respective Chapters. The tribunal was headed by a Tribunal President (\"prezydent\" in Crown, \"prezes\" in Lithuanian Tribunal) and a Marshal (\"marszałek trybunału\"). The Marshal was chosen from and by the judges themselves, while the President dealt with ecclesiastic matters (and was himself a high-ranking priest). \n\nTwo main locations of the Crown Tribunal were the towns of Piotrków Trybunalski (for lands of Greater Poland, held in autumn and winter) and Lublin (for lands of Lesser Poland, in spring and summer). Until 1590 some sessions were held in Łuck, and since 1764 in Poznań.\n\nA session of the Tribunal would last six months.\n\nDecisions were supposed to be taken by consensus in the first or second voting, if there was no consensus, the third could was to be decided by a simple majority.\n\nThe Tribunals had many problems since their creation, as the judges rarely had any formal training and were basically politicians elected each year. With the progressing degradation of Polish political system, in the early 18th century the Tribunals became as corrupted and dependent on the magnates as the Polish parliament, Sejm. Several minor reforms had little effect until finally, the Tribunals were subject to a major reform by the Great Sejm of 1788-1792.

Such differences include the values, behavior, education, and customs of the respective cultures. \nAs international communications, travel, and trade have expanded, some of the communication and cultural divisions have lessened. Books on how to handle and be aware of cultural differences seek to prepare business people and travelers. Immigrants and migrant laborers need to learn the ways of a new culture. Tourists can also be confronted with variants in protocols for tipping, body language, personal space, dress codes, and other cultural issues. Language instructors try to teach cultural differences as well.\n\nA \"legal culture\" is a system of laws and precedents peculiar to a nation, region, religion, or other organized group. A culture gap occurs when incompatible or opposing systems might be applied to the same situation or assumed by the parties. Legal constructs such as contracts and corporations are not uniform across cultures. In some cases, such a gap is intentionally sought by one party, as in forum shopping for a more favorable legal framework or in libel tourism, by which speech protected in one jurisdiction may be actionable in another.\n\nA \"generation gap\" occurs when the experiences and attitudes of one generation differ significantly from those of another. The world wars contributed to generation gaps in several nations. The term first saw widespread use in contrasting the Baby Boomer generation with their parents. The \"Youth culture\" of adolescents and teenagers seeking to stake out their own identity and independence from their parents often results in a cultural divide. Younger generations have experienced different technologies, freedoms and standards of propriety.\n\nCommunication between and collaboration among scientific disciplines is sometimes hindered by use of different paradigms or competition between the desires to describe a simple explanatory framework and elucidate fine details.

A culture gap occurs when people with different cultures sit together and take the same class. Different cultures behave differently towards the teacher both in class and after class. Differences can be noticed in assessment method and the direction method of the class.\n\nAsian students focus on books and exercises more than European and American students, who are willing to raise questions in the classes. The cultural gap in education is due to the different education traditions in different places.\n\nFor example, Asian students receive exam-oriented education, but European and American students receive a very different, freer education and are both expected to challenge their teachers and strongly encouraged to challenge the teachers in class.\n\nIn both China and Japan, the education system normally usually uses exams to show a student's ability. In American and Britain, students grade instructors according to ability.\n\nBoth systems have advantages and disadvantages but form a cultural gap between people.

{"id": "58717013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58717013", "title": "Death of Eleanor de Freitas", "text": "Death of Eleanor de Freitas\n\nEleanor Poppy Miranda de Freitas (26 June 1990 to 4 April 2014) was an English woman who committed suicide three days before the commencement of her trial for perverting the course of justice for allegedly making a false accusation of rape. Her death prompted a debate over whether prosecuting people accused of making a false accusation of rape could deter rape victims from reporting the crime, as well as whether it was appropriate to prosecute vulnerable individuals (de Freitas had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and depression and was judged by a psychiatrist to represent a suicide risk). The decision to prosecute de Freitas was ultimately upheld by both the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney General for England and Wales, while the Metropolitan Police Service paid compensation to the accused man due to misconduct by the investigating officers. From a legal perspective, the case was notable due to the use of a private prosecution and the first successful employment of a public interest defence to a charge of defamation.\n\nEleanor Poppy Miranda de Freitas was born on 26 June 1990 and grew up in London. She attended the independent Putney High School, achieving straight As in her A Level exams. In 2008 she enrolled in Grey College, Durham University to study geography. During her first year, she suffered a mental breakdown. She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and depression and began seeing a psychiatrist, who prescribed her antidepressants. At the end of the 2008/09 academic year, de Freitas dropped out of Durham University. \n\nIn February 2012, de Freitas had another mental breakdown. She accused her parents of trying to poison her and her landlord of sexually assaulting her; went on unaffordable shopping sprees; and became delusional. She was involuntarily committed under the Mental Health Act 1983 and spent a month in Ealing Hospital. After leaving Ealing Hospital, de Freitas began living alone with support from her parents and working part-time in a shop. Unbeknown to her parents, she reportedly also worked as a tantric masseuse. In summer 2013, she began training as an accountant.\n\nIn 2008 or 2009, de Freitas met Alexander Economou, the company secretary of a shipping agency. They became friends after attending the same party in Chelsea in October 2012. On 23 December 2012, de Freitas and Economou had sex. On 4 January 2013, de Freitas alleged to the Metropolitan Police Service that Economou had raped her. In an interview with police, she asserted that she \"wasn't in control of my body\" due to combining alcohol with her bipolar medicine and was unable to consent; that Economou had \"drugged\" her; that she had been \"frozen with fear\"; and that Economou had coerced her into allowing him to tie her up, \"waterboard\" her, and have unprotected sex with her. Economou was arrested and spent a night in custody. On 20 February 2013, the Police decided to take no further action against Economou; he was never charged. Economou asserted that the sex had been consensual; that he had ended the relationship on 24 December after discovering de Freitas was working as a tantric masseuse and after receiving \"crazy\" text messages from de Freitas; and that de Freitas had fabricated the rape claim \"as an act of revenge, because I rejected her\".\n\nIn August 2013, Economou launched a private prosecution of de Freitas for perverting the course of justice at a cost of approximately £200,000. Economou amassed witness statements, text messages and closed-circuit television footage that contradicted the account of de Freitas, including footage of de Freitas and himself shopping together for sex toys at an Ann Summers shop on the day following the alleged rape and text messages de Freitas had sent to mutual friends. Upon receiving the summons on 13 August 2013, de Freitas reportedly had a panic attack. She engaged a defence solicitor who invited Keir Starmer, the Director of Public Prosecutions of the Crown Prosecution Service, to use his statutory power to take over the private prosecution and end it. However, in December 2013, the Crown Prosecution Service instead announced that it would instead take over and continue the prosecution. de Freitas subsequently instructed her defence solicitor to seek an injunction against reporting on the prosecution. The Metropolitan Police Service officers who had investigated the alleged rape refused to support the Crown Prosecution Service but were overruled. de Freitas was arraigned at Southwark Crown Court on 24 January 2014, pleading not guilty.\n\nRape counselling services were withdrawn from de Freitas upon the commencement of the prosecution (in March 2015, Member of Parliament Valerie Vaz asked Solicitor General for England and Wales Robert Buckland to \"review the guidance to ensure that the provision of support and counselling services to vulnerable people is not removed abruptly\"). de Freitas became \"severely\" depressed and her behaviour became erratic, including claiming she was being followed and that her phone was being tapped and wearing a burqa when going out in public. In September 2013, she was found in a branch of Co-op Food on Strand throwing crisp packets and shouting at staff. A psychiatric report prepared for the Crown Prosecution Service stated that de Freitas was fit to stand trial but required constant evaluation as she posed a \"chronic and significant\" suicide risk. Her doctor did not prescribe lithium for her bipolar disorder as de Freitas suffered from a fear of needles.\n\nOn 4 April 2014, de Freitas committed suicide by hanging herself at her family home in Fulham, London. Her trial for perverting the course of justice had been due to commence on 7 April. She left a suicide note in which she stated, \"If I were to lose the case I know that I would have brought huge shame on the family. It's entirely my fault for what has happened and there are many other events which make me make this decision.\" She also expressed fears about potentially having to testify in court in her defence. \n\nAt an inquest held in March 2015, coroner Chinyere Inyama recorded a verdict of suicide and noted that the impending trial had been a \"significant stressor\" on de Freitas. A call by solicitor Harriet Wistrich on behalf of de Freitas' family to widen the scope of the inquest to assess whether the Crown Prosecution Service had breached the right to life enshrined in the Human Rights Act 1998 by prosecuting de Freitas was unsuccessful.\n\nFollowing de Freitas' suicide, her father David criticised the decision to prosecute her, stating, \"We can see no reason whatsoever why the CPS pursued Eleanor. If the CPS had put a stop to it at the time I would still have a daughter.\" David de Freitas suggested that de Freitas had feared once again being involuntarily committed and was embarrassed that evidence would emerge during the trial relating to her work in the sex industry. de Freitas had been concerned about having to testify in her defence in court; delays by the Crown Prosecution Service in providing a record of her interview with police to her defence solicitor meant they were unable to confirm that she would not be required to testify until the morning of her death (a court order requiring the Crown Prosecution Service to disclose all evidence at least six weeks prior to the trial was not complied with). The Crown Prosecution Service later apologised for the delay in the disclosure of the evidence.\n\nThe decision to prosecute de Freitas was also criticised by the organisation Women Against Rape, which argued that the \"aggressive pursuit\" of women accused of making false allegations of rape in the United Kingdom was deterring rape victims from reporting the crime to the police. The charity Victim Support released a statement expressing concerns about the use of private prosecutions to \"intimidate\" people making allegations of rape, while the charity Justice for Women stated \"the public interest is always overwhelmingly in favour of not prosecuting a rape complainant\" and \"it is imperative that the overwhelming public interest in improving the UK's appallingly low conviction rate for rape offences is considered by all prosecutors when deciding whether to charge women for perverting the course of justice\". Lisa Avalos of the University of Arkansas stated that the United Kingdom makes significantly more prosecutions for false rape allegations than the United States, and that these carry a charge of perverting the course of justice (with a maximum sentence of life in prison) rather than false reporting (which carries lighter penalties such as community service, fines, or probation). The charity INQUEST cited statistics showing \"no country pursues the prosecution of disbelieved rape complainants with the frequency that occurs in Britain\". An alternative view was expressed by journalist Radhika Sanghani, who wrotes that \"false rape allegations can have devastating consequences for the accused\" and noted that over a 17 month period in 2011 to 2012 there were only 35 prosecutions for false rape allegations in England and Wales, compared to 5,651 prosecutions for rape. Sarah Green of the End Violence Against Women Coalition opinioned, \"We must prosecute these cases if someone's trying to maliciously get someone into trouble.\"\n\nThe suicide prompted Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders to review the decision to prosecute. In December 2014, Saunders concluded that it had been correct to do so, stating that there was \"sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction\" and \"a strong public interest in prosecuting\". Saunders also stated that medical experts had advised that de Freitas was fit to stand trial. After de Freitas' father David called for a new inquiry or a review to be carried out, in June 2018, Attorney General for England and Wales Jeremy Wright decided not to order an independent inquiry into the decision to prosecute, stating, \"I have carefully considered the concerns raised by Mr de Freitas and I am satisfied that this case has already been subject to extensive scrutiny within the CPS, and that it was right for the prosecution to go ahead.\"\n\nIn December 2014, Alexander Economou began a libel claim against David de Freitas, asserting that articles critical of the Crown Prosecution Service appearing in \"The Daily Telegraph\" and \"The Guardian\" and a broadcast on \"BBC Radio 4\" had resulted in him enduring \"public rubbishing\" and damaged his reputation. The claim was dismissed in July 2016 with the judge ruling that, while Economou's reputation had been damaged, this was justified given de Freitas had considered the articles and broadcast to be in the public interest and that ruling in favour of Economou would represent a disproportionate infringement upon de Freitas' freedom of speech. This represented the first time a public interest defence had been successfully mounted under the Defamation Act 2013. An appeal by Economou against the ruling was dismissed by the Court of Appeal in November 2018. Economou subsequently sought permission to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe BBC issued a retraction and apology in May 2015 after Lisa Longstaff of Women Against Rape indirectly referred to Economou as a \"rapist\" while being interviewed on a live episode of \"Victoria Derbyshire\".\n\nIn December 2015, Economou was charged with harassing David de Freitas. It was alleged that Economou had sent letters and emails to de Freitas and his solicitor, Harriet Wistrich, and \"uploaded various recordings and comments onto websites\". Economou was found not guilty in June 2016, with the judge stating, \"I find that the defendant's actions were calculated to counter the continuing incorrect assertions that the allegation of rape was true\".\n\nIn November 2018, Economou received £10,000 of compensation from the Metropolitan Police Service due to misconduct on the part of officers who had investigated the initial complaint made by de Freitas.\n\n"}

{"id": "677130", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=677130", "title": "Desuetude", "text": "Desuetude\n\nIn law, desuetude (; , ) is a doctrine that causes statutes, similar legislation, or legal principles to lapse and become unenforceable by a long habit of non-enforcement or lapse of time. It is what happens to laws that are not repealed when they become obsolete. It is the legal doctrine that long and continued non-use of a law renders it invalid, at least in the sense that courts will no longer tolerate punishing its transgressors.\n\nThe policy of inserting sunset clauses into a constitution or charter of rights (as in Canada since 1982) or into regulations and other delegated/subordinate legislation made under an act (as in Australia since the early 1990s) can be regarded as a statutory codification of this doctrine.\n\nThe doctrine of desuetude has not historically been favoured in the common law tradition. In 1818, the English court of King's Bench held in the case of \"Ashford v Thornton\" that trial by combat remained available at a defendant's option in a case where it was available under the common law. The concept of desuetude has more currency in the civil law tradition, which is more regulated by legislative codes and less bound by precedent. The doctrine went into decline after the Middle Ages, when the idea became prevalent that the king's assent was required to nullify a law.\n\nThe doctrine lasted longer in Scotland where it appeared to operate as a form of repeal. In Scotland, non-use is not the same as desuetude. Disuse must be accompanied by other identifiable provisions that would make the enforcement of the statute inconsistent: neglect over such a period of time that it would appear that a contrary custom had developed; and that a contrary practice had developed which is inconsistent with the law. Regarding the Scottish application, Lord McKay stated in \"Brown vs. Magistrates of Edinburgh\":\nDesuetude does not apply to requirements of the United States Constitution. In \"Walz v. Tax Commission of the City of New York\", 397 U.S. 664, 678 (1970), the United States Supreme Court asserted that: \"It is obviously correct that no one acquires a vested or protected right in violation of the Constitution by long use, even when that span of time covers our entire national existence and indeed predates it.\"\n\nIt may, however, have validity as a doctrine in defense of penal prosecution. In 1825, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court declined to enforce the traditional punishment of ducking for women convicted as common scolds, stating that \"total disuse of any civil institution for ages past, may afford just and rational objections against disrespected and superannuated ordinances.\" \"Wright v. Crane\", 13 Serg. & Rawle 220, 228 (Pa. 1825).\n\nThe seminal modern case under U.S. state law is a West Virginia opinion regarding desuetude, \"Committee on Legal Ethics v. Printz\", 187 W.Va. 182, 416 S.E.2d 720 (1992). In that case, the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals held that penal statutes may become void under the doctrine of desuetude if:\n\n\nThis holding was reaffirmed in 2003 in \"State ex rel. Canterbury v. Blake\", 584 S.E.2d 512 (W. Va. 2003).\n\nWhile it may not be a violation of due process to enforce a desuetudinal law, the fact that a law has long gone unenforced may present a bar to standing in a suit to prevent its future enforcement. In \"Poe v. Ullman\", the Supreme Court refused to hear a challenge to Connecticut's ban on birth control, writing:\n\nThe undeviating policy of nullification by Connecticut of its anti-contraceptive laws throughout all the long years that they have been on the statute books bespeaks more than prosecutorial paralysis ... \"Deeply embedded traditional ways of carrying out state policy ...\" – or not carrying it out – \"are often tougher and truer law than the dead words of the written text.\"\n\nShortly thereafter, Connecticut's birth control law was enforced, and struck down, in \"Griswold v.

{"id": "337522", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=337522", "title": "Eolas", "text": "Eolas\n\nEolas (, meaning \"Knowledge\"; bacronym: \"Embedded Objects Linked Across Systems\") is a United States technology company accused of mainly acting as a patent troll and described as \"The Web’s longest nightmare\". It was founded in 1994 by Michael David Doyle. \n\nHis University of California, San Francisco team claimed to have created the first web browser that supported plugins. They demonstrated it at Xerox PARC, in November 1993, at the second Bay Area SIGWEB meeting. The claim that this was an innovation, advanced to justify their patent application, has been contested by Pei-Yuan Wei, who developed the earlier Viola browser, which added plugin capabilities in 1992, a claim supported by inventor of the WWW Sir Tim Berners-Lee and other Web pioneers. Given only a short time to prepare, Wei was only able to demonstrate Viola's equivalent capabilities for local rather than remote files at the 2003 Eolas v. Microsoft trial, and thus fell short of proving prior art to the trial court's satisfaction. The case with Microsoft over patent 5,838,906 was settled in 2007 for a confidential amount of money after an initial $565 million judgment was stayed on appeal, but the University of California disclosed its piece of the final settlement as $30.4 million. In 2009 Eolas sued numerous other companies over patent number 7,599,985 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. As of June 2011, a number of these companies, including Texas Instruments, Oracle and JPMorgan Chase, had signed licensing deals with Eolas, while the company continued to seek payoffs from others. \n\nHowever, in February 2012, an eight-person jury in the Eastern District of Texas invalidated the ’906 and ’985 patents, and in July 2012, Judge Leonard Davis ruled against Eolas. One year later, moreover, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit sustained that ruling, thereby putting an end to the company's long history of very profitable \"infringement\" lawsuits.\n\nIn September 1995, the founders of Eolas released WebRouser, a proof-of-concept browser based on Mosaic that implemented plugins, client-side image maps, and web-page-defined browser buttons and menus. In 2005, Doyle released 'Muse', a \"multimedia doodling application\". In 2012, Eolas developed the Einstein Brain Atlas iPad app for the National Museum of Health and Medicine Chicago, which was named the Gizmodo App of the Day.\n\nUS patent 5,838,906, titled \"Distributed hypermedia method for automatically invoking external application providing interaction and display of embedded objects within a hypermedia document,\" was filed on October 17, 1994 and granted on November 17, 1998.\n\nIn Autumn 2003, the inventor of the World Wide Web and the Director of the W3C Consortium Tim Berners-Lee wrote to the Under Secretary of Commerce, asking for this patent to be invalidated, in order to \"eliminate this major impediment to the operation of the Web\". Leaders of Open Source Community sided with Microsoft in fighting the patent due to its threat to the free nature of the Web and to the basic established HTML standards. The specific concerns of having one company (Eolas) controlling a critical piece of the Web framework were cited.\n\nIn March 2004, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) re-examined and initially rejected the patent. Eolas submitted a rebuttal in May 2004. On September 27, 2005, the USPTO upheld the validity of the patent. The PTO ruling rejected the relevance of Pei Wei's Viola code to the Eolas patent. According to the University of California press release, \"In its 'Reasons for Patentability/Confirmation' notice, the patent examiner rejected the arguments for voiding UC's previously approved patent claims for the Web-browser technology as well as the evidence presented to suggest that the technology had been developed prior to the UC innovation. The examiner considered the Viola reference the primary reference asserted by Microsoft at trial as a prior art publication and found that Viola does 'not teach nor fairly suggest that instant 906 invention, as claimed.'\"\n\nEolas was granted a second patent in October 2009 related to the same technology.\n\nMicrosoft declined to license the technology when it was offered to them (and others) in 1994.\n\nIn 1999, Eolas filed suit in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against Microsoft over validity and use of the patent. Eolas won the initial case in August 2003 and was awarded damages of $ from Microsoft for infringement. The District Court reaffirmed the jury's decision in January 2004.\n\nIn June 2004, Microsoft appealed the case to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In March 2005, the District Court judgment was remanded, but the infringement and damages parts of the case were upheld. The appeals court ruled that the two Viola-related exhibits that had been thrown out of the original trial needed to be shown to a jury in a retrial. Microsoft quickly filed for a rehearing.\n\nIn October 2005, the Supreme Court of the United States refused to hear Microsoft's appeal, leaving intact the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in favor of Eolas with respect to foreign sales of Microsoft Windows. However, the remand to District Court had not been heard yet.\n\nIn May 2007, the USPTO agreed to allow Microsoft to argue ownership of the patent after they reissued a Microsoft patent that covers the same concepts as outlined in the Eolas patent, and contains wording that mirrors the Eolas patent.\nThe USPTO ruled in favor of Eolas on that matter in September 2007.\n\nMicrosoft and Eolas agreed in July 2007 to delay a pending re-trial, in order to negotiate a settlement. On August 27, 2007, Eolas reported to its shareholders that a settlement had been reached and that Eolas expected to pay a substantial dividend as a result; the exact amount and terms of the settlement were not disclosed.\n\nIn October 2009, Eolas sued a number of large corporations for infringement of the same patent. The 22 sued corporations include Adobe, Amazon.com, Apple, Argosy Publishing, Blockbuster, CDW Corp., Citigroup, eBay, Frito-Lay, The Go Daddy Group, Google, J.C. Penney Co. Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., New Frontier Media Inc., Office Depot Inc., Perot Systems Corp., Playboy Enterprises International Inc., Rent-A-Center Inc., Staples Inc., Sun Microsystems Inc., Texas Instruments Inc., Yahoo! Inc., and YouTube LLC. Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols, writing in Computerworld's opinion section, called Eolas a patent troll after these lawsuits were initiated. As of June 2011, a number of these companies, including Texas Instruments, Oracle and JPMorgan Chase have signed licensing deals with Eolas, while others are still litigating.\n\nIn February 2012, a Texas jury found that two of Eolas' patents were invalid after testimony from several defendants including Tim Berners-Lee and Pei-Yuan Wei, credited as creator of the Viola browser. The testimony professed that the Viola browser included Eolas' claimed inventions before the filing date (September 7, 1993). There is \"substantial evidence that Viola was publicly known and used\" before the plaintiffs' alleged conception date, it added. The ruling effectively ends a pending lawsuit against 22 companies including Yahoo, Google, and many online retailers.\n\nIn July 23, 2013, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which has nationwide jurisdiction, affirmed a Texas federal court which had ruled in July 2012 that several claims relating to the two patents in the suit were invalid, a ruling which Eolas had appealed. This probably means that the Eolas patents are finally dead, to the relief of a vast online community.\n\nIn February 2006, Microsoft modified its Internet Explorer web browser to appear to side-step the Eolas patent. The change, first discussed in 2003,\nrequires users to click once on an ActiveX control to \"activate\" it before they can use its interface. The specific message is \"Click to activate this control\", shown as a tooltip when the cursor is held over the embedded object. However, following a November 2007 announcement that Microsoft had \"licensed the technologies from Eolas\",\nin April 2008, Microsoft released an update which removed the click-to-activate functionality, reverting the software to its original design.\n\nIn June 2006, Opera Software released version 9 of its Opera browser for Windows and other operating systems, with modifications similar to Microsoft's.\n\nDoyle has stated that Eolas would offer royalty-free licenses to non-commercial entities. A statement on Eolas' web site clarifies the company's policy with regard to such licenses. , no Eolas license has been granted to the Mozilla Foundation which develops the open-source Mozilla Firefox browser.\n\nBefore the company's patents were invalidated in 2012, one workaround was to dynamically create the HTML element containing the plug-in using JavaScript, rather than embedding it on the page. In this situation, Internet Explorer did not ask the user for an \"activation\" click because the patent did not cover embedded scripting.\n\nOpera users could use User JavaScript functionality in the browser to work around this issue with locally modified JavaScript.\n\n\n"}

A provisional government was established in the village of Rovereta, in opposition to the outgoing Captains-Regent whose term had expired.\n\nFollowing the end of the fascist government and World War II, the 1945 general elections produced a Communist-Socialist coalition government. In the 1955 general elections, the ruling coalition won 35 of the 60 seats in the Grand and General Council. Five moderate Socialist members of the council wanted to break the alliance with the Communists who were close to the Soviet Union and did not condemn Soviet actions during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. They left in April 1957 to form a new party, the Sammarinese Independent Democratic Socialist Party (PSDIS). This left a perfect 30–30 split in the council that paralyzed the government. Given the deadlock, the Captains-Regent avoided convening the council until the mandatory 19 September regency election to choose their replacements.\n\nA day before the election, one Communist councilor became an independent and joined the opposition, giving them the majority. However it was the practice of the Socialist and Communist parties to enforce party discipline by making their councilors sign letters of resignation after each election, with the date left blank. The party chiefs submitted to the regency all 35 letters, including the six who left their parties, with the date of 19 September. With the majority of seats vacant in the council there was no quorum, so the regency dissolved the council until new general elections could be held on 3 November. But because the council did not elect a new regency, the status of the sitting regency would be uncertain once their terms expired on 1 October, causing a constitutional crisis. The regency ordered the Gendarmerie to seal off the Palazzo Pubblico, preventing any councilors from entering. The opposition was in an uproar as the six defectors claimed their resignations were invalid and what transpired was a coup. On 30 September, opposition councilors occupied an abandoned factory in the town of Rovereta, Serravalle on the Italian border. At the stroke of midnight when the regency should have expired, the councilors declared a provisional government.\n\nItaly recognized the provisional government and Italian Carabinieri protected the three sides of the factory that sat in their territory. The regency organized a militia of supporters and weapons flowed in from Italy to both sides. On 11 October, the regency caved in and recognized the provisional government, ending the crisis. The new government elected a new regency. One of its acts was to provide for women's suffrage. General elections were held in 1959, confirming the victory of the PSDIS-Christian Democrat coalition.\n\n\n"}

Generally, any natural body of water that is larger than in size is public water. In certain New England states, this legal definition exists at both common law and statutory law.\n\nAs is often the case in the United States, the \"law of great ponds\" descended from early English common law. In 1890, Charles Doe, Chief Justice of the New Hampshire Supreme Court, described the development of the law of great ponds in \"Concord Mfg. Co. v. Robertson\", a case concerning the rights of individuals to cut and remove ice from a pond adjacent to land they had leased, subsequently reducing the flow of water at a downstream mill. The rights of the ice harvesters and mill owners turned on the question of who owned the water in the pond. In the opinion, Chief Justice Doe stated that \"[t]ide waters and large ponds are public waters. Whatever exceptions, if any, may be found, this is the rule.\"\n\nThe English rule used to distinguish between public and private waters was based on the limit of the tide, for those waters that were navigable were subject to admiralty jurisdiction. In the U.S., this rule had been extended to include navigable fresh water \"reasonably capable of valuable use as a public way.\" However, it was not always clear that a pond – isolated from the ocean or a navigable river, but otherwise in the public domain – was reserved for public use. Furthermore, the ability to hunt and fish on public lands had been denied to citizens during feudal times, and that \"system of legal inequality in the enjoyment of public property\" was precisely what the colonists sought to avoid. Thus, a new rule defining public waters needed to be established that was not based on the navigability of the waters.\n\nFrom the \"Concord Mfg. Co.\" decision:\nA great pond is defined in Maine state statute as \"any inland body of water which in a natural state has a surface area in excess of 10 acres (40,000 m²) and any inland body of water artificially formed or increased which has a surface area in excess of 30 acres (120,000 m²) except for the purposes of this article, where the artificially formed or increased inland body of water is completely surrounded by land held by a single owner.\"\n\nThe term \"great pond\" originally derives from colonial statutes pre-dating Maine's separation from Massachusetts. Special statutory regulations apply to land adjacent to great ponds for the purposes of shoreland protection and timber harvesting. Maine state law provides for public access to \"great ponds.\" \n\nA great pond is defined in Massachusetts statutes as a pond or lake that is in its natural state at least in size. This includes ponds that met the criterion at one time but are now smaller.\n\nMassachusetts General Law states that all great ponds must be open for fishing and boating, including providing reasonable access to the pond, except for reservoirs.\n\nIn New Hampshire, public waters are defined by common law to include all natural ponds of more than . In addition to the common law definition of great ponds, similar definitions can be found in the New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated, for example, in the Wetlands Act, RSA 482-A:21.\n\n"}
{"id": "8758045", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8758045", "title": "Habeas corpus in the United States", "text": "Habeas corpus in the United States\n\nHabeas corpus () is a recourse in law challenging the reasons or conditions of a person's confinement under color of law. A petition for habeas corpus is filed with a court that has jurisdiction over the custodian, and if granted, a writ is issued directing the custodian to bring the confined person before the court for examination into those reasons or conditions. The Suspension Clause of the United States Constitution specifically included the English common law procedure in Article One, Section 9, clause 2, which demands that \"The privilege of the writ of \"habeas corpus\" shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.\"\n\nUnited States law affords persons the right to petition the federal courts for a writ of habeas corpus. Individual states also afford persons the ability to petition their own state court systems for habeas corpus pursuant to their respective constitutions and laws when held or sentenced by state authorities.\n\nFederal habeas review did not extend to those in state custody until almost a century after the nation's founding. During the Civil War and Reconstruction, as later during the War on Terrorism, the right to petition for a writ of habeas corpus was substantially curtailed for persons accused of engaging in certain conduct. In reaction to the former, and to ensure state courts enforced federal law, a Reconstruction Act for the first time extended the right of federal court habeas review to those in the custody of state courts (prisons and jails), expanding the writ essentially to all imprisoned on American soil. The federal habeas statute that resulted, with substantial amendments, is now at 28 U.S.C. § 2241. For many decades, the great majority of habeas petitions reviewed in federal court have been filed by those confined in state prisons by sentence of a state court for state crimes (e.g., murder, rape, robbery, etc.), since in the American system, most crimes have historically been a matter of state law.\n\nThe privilege of \"habeas corpus\" is not a right against unlawful arrest, but rather a right to be released from imprisonment after such arrest. If one believes the arrest is without legal merit and subsequently refuses to come willingly, he still may be guilty of resisting arrest, which can sometimes be a crime in and of itself (even if the initial arrest itself was illegal) depending on the state.\n\nHabeas corpus derives from the English common law where the first recorded usage was in 1305, in the reign of King Edward I of England. The procedure for the issuing of writs of \"habeas corpus\" was first codified by the Habeas Corpus Act 1679, following judicial rulings which had restricted the effectiveness of the writ. A previous act had been passed in 1640 to overturn a ruling that the command of the Queen was a sufficient answer to a petition of \"habeas corpus\". Winston Churchill, in his chapter on the English Common Law in \"The Birth of Britain\", explains the process thus:\n\nThe writ of \"habeas corpus\" was issued by a superior court in the name of the Monarch, and commanded the addressee (a lower court, sheriff, or private subject) to produce the prisoner before the Royal courts of law. Petitions for \"habeas corpus\" could be made by the prisoner himself or by a third party on his behalf, and as a result of the Habeas Corpus Acts could be made regardless of whether the court was in session, by presenting the petition to a judge.\n\nThe 1679 Act remains important in 21st century cases. This Act and the historical body of British practice that relies upon it has been used to interpret the \"habeas\" rights granted by the United States Constitution, while taking into account the understanding of the writ held by the framers of the Constitution.\n\nThe Suspension Clause of Article I does not \"expressly\" establish a right to the writ of \"habeas corpus\"; rather, it prevents Congress from restricting it. There has been much scholarly debate over whether the Clause positively establishes a right under the federal constitution, merely exists to prevent Congress from prohibiting state courts from granting the writ, or protects a pre-existing common law right enforceable by federal judges. However, in the cases of \"Immigration and Naturalization Service v. St. Cyr\" (2001), and \"Boumediene v. Bush\" (2008) the U.S. Supreme Court suggested that the Suspension Clause protects \"the writ as it existed in 1789,\" that is, as a writ which federal judges could issue in the exercise of their common law authority.\n\nRegardless of whether the writ is positively guaranteed by the constitution, \"habeas corpus\" was first established by statute in the Judiciary Act of 1789. This statutory writ applied only to those held in custody by officials of the executive branch of the federal government and not to those held by state governments, which independently afford \"habeas corpus\" pursuant to their respective constitutions and laws. From 1789 until 1866, the federal writ of \"habeas corpus\" was largely restricted to prisoners in federal custody, at a time when no direct appeals from federal criminal convictions were provided for by law. \"Habeas corpus\" remained the only means for judicial review of federal capital convictions until 1889, and the only means for review of federal convictions for other \"infamous crimes\" until 1891. Until 1983 the writ of \"habeas corpus\" remained the only way that decisions of military courts could be reviewed by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe authority of federal courts to review the claims of prisoners in state custody was not clearly established until Congress adopted a statute (28 U.S.C. § 2254) granting federal courts that authority in 1867, as part of the post-Civil War Reconstruction. The U.S. Supreme Court in the case of \"Waley v. Johnson\" (1942) interpreted this authority broadly to allow the writ to be used to challenge convictions or sentences in violation of a defendant's constitutional rights where no other remedy was available.\n\nThe U.S. Congress grants federal district courts, the Supreme Court, and all Article III federal judges, acting in their own right, jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 to issue writs of \"habeas corpus\" to release prisoners held by any government entity within the country from custody, subject to certain limitations, if the prisoner\n\nIn 1950s and 1960s, decisions by the Warren Court greatly expanded the use and scope of the federal writ largely due to the \"constitutionalizing\" of criminal procedure by applying the Bill of Rights, in part, to state courts using the incorporation doctrine. This afforded state prisoners many more opportunities to claim that their convictions were unconstitutional, which provided grounds for habeas corpus relief. In the last thirty years, decisions by the Burger and Rehnquist Courts have somewhat narrowed the writ.\n\nThe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) further limited the use of the federal writ by imposing a one-year statute of limitations and dramatically increasing the federal judiciary's deference to decisions previously made in state court proceedings either on appeal or in a state court habeas corpus action. One of AEDPA's most controversial changes is the requirement that any constitutional right invoked to vacate a state court conviction rooted in a mistake of law by the state court must have \"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, \"as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\".\" Thus, a U.S. Court of Appeals must ignore its own precedents and affirm a state court decision contrary to its precedents, if the U.S. Supreme Court has never squarely addressed a particular issue of federal law.\n\nOn April 27, 1861, the right of \"habeas corpus\" was unilaterally suspended by President Abraham Lincoln in Maryland during the American Civil War. Lincoln had received word that anti-war Maryland officials intended to destroy the railroad tracks between Annapolis and Philadelphia, which was a vital supply line for the army preparing to fight the south. (Indeed, soon after, the Maryland legislature would simultaneously vote to stay in the Union and to close these rail lines, in an apparent effort to prevent war between its northern and southern neighbors.) Lincoln did not issue a sweeping order; it only applied to the Maryland route. Lincoln chose to suspend the writ over a proposal to bombard Baltimore, favored by his General-in-Chief Winfield Scott. Lincoln was also motivated by requests by generals to set up military courts to rein in his political opponents, \"Copperheads,\" or Peace Democrats, so named because they did not want to resort to war to force the southern states back into the Union, as well as to intimidate those in the Union who supported the Confederate cause. Congress was not yet in session to consider a suspension of the writs; however, when it came into session it failed to pass a bill favored by Lincoln to sanction his suspensions. During this period one sitting U.S. Congressman from the opposing party, as well as the mayor, police chief, entire Board of Police, and the city council of Baltimore were arrested without charge and imprisoned indefinitely without trial.\n\nLincoln's action was rapidly challenged in court and overturned by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Maryland (led by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Roger B. Taney) in \"Ex Parte Merryman.\" Chief Justice Taney ruled the suspension unconstitutional, stating that only Congress could suspend habeas corpus. Lincoln and his Attorney General Edward Bates not only ignored the Chief Justice's order, but when Lincoln's dismissal of the ruling was criticized in an editorial by prominent Baltimore newspaper editor Frank Key Howard, they had the editor also arrested by federal troops without charge or trial. The troops imprisoned Howard, who was Francis Scott Key's grandson, in Fort McHenry, which, as he noted, was the same fort where the Star Spangled Banner had been waving \"o'er the land of the free\" in his grandfather's song. (In 1863, Howard wrote about his experience as a \"political prisoner\" at Fort McHenry in the book \"Fourteen Months in the American Bastille\"; two of the publishers selling the book were then arrested.)\n\nWhen Congress convened in July 1861 it failed to support Lincoln's unilateral suspension of habeas corpus. A joint resolution was introduced into the Senate to approve of the president's suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, but filibustering by Senate Democrats, who did not support it, and opposition to its imprecise wording by Sen. Lyman Trumbull prevented a vote on the resolution before the end of the first session, and the resolution was not taken up again. Sen. Trumbull himself introduced a bill to suspend habeas corpus, but failed on getting a vote before the end of the first session.\n\nShortly thereafter, on September 17, 1861, the day the Maryland legislature was to reconvene, Lincoln imprisoned one third of the members of the Maryland General Assembly without charges or hearings in further defiance of the Chief Justice's ruling. Thus, the legislative session had to be cancelled.\n\nOn February 14, 1862, the war was firmly in progress and Lincoln ordered most prisoners released, putting an end to court challenges for the time being. He again suspended habeas corpus on his own authority in September that same year, however, in response to resistance to his calling up of the militia.\n\nWhen Congress met again in December 1862, the House of Representatives passed a bill indemnifying the president for his suspension of habeas corpus. The Senate amended the bill, and the compromise reported out of the conference committee altered it to remove the indemnity and to suspend habeas corpus on Congress's own authority. That bill, the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act, was signed into law March 3, 1863. Lincoln exercised his powers under it in September, suspending habeas corpus throughout the Union in any case involving prisoners of war, spies, traitors, or military personnel, The suspension of habeas corpus remained in effect until Andrew Johnson revoked it on December 1, 1865.\n\nGeneral Ambrose E. Burnside had former-Congressman Clement Vallandigham arrested in May 1863 for continuing to express sympathy for the Confederate cause after having been warned to cease doing so. Vallandigham was tried by a military tribunal and sentenced to two years in a military prison. Lincoln quickly commuted his sentence to banishment to the Confederacy. Vallandigham appealed his sentence, arguing that the Enrollment Act did not authorize his trial by a military tribunal rather than in ordinary civilian courts, that he was not ordinarily subject to court martial, and that Gen. Burnside could not expand the jurisdiction of military courts on his own authority. The Supreme Court did not address the substance of Vallandigham's appeal, instead denying that it possessed the jurisdiction to review the proceedings of military tribunals without explicit congressional authorization.\n\nIn 1864, Lambdin P. Milligan and four others were accused of planning to steal Union weapons and invade Union prisoner-of-war camps and were sentenced to hang by a military court. However, their execution was not set until May 1865, so they were able to argue the case after the war ended. In \"Ex parte Milligan\" (1866), the U.S. Supreme Court decided that Congress's 1863 suspension of the writ did not empower the President to try to convict citizens before military tribunals where the civil courts were open and operational. This was one of the key Supreme Court Cases of the American Civil War that dealt with wartime civil liberties and martial law.\n\nIn the Confederacy, Jefferson Davis also suspended \"habeas corpus\" and imposed martial law. Shortly after his inauguration as president of the Confederacy, an act of the Confederate Congress of February 27, 1862, was passed authorizing Davis to suspend the writ of habeas corpus and declare martial law \"in such towns, cities, and military districts as shall, in his judgment, be in such danger of attack by the enemy.\" The Confederate Congress passed a limiting act two months to restrict the suspension of the writ \"to arrests made by the authorities of the Confederate Government, or for offences against the same\" and to add a sunset clause providing that authorization to suspend habeas corpus would expire 30 days after the next meeting of Congress. \n\nIn various proclamations and orders beginning in 1862, Davis suspended the writ and declared martial law in parts of Virginia (including the Confederate capital of Richmond, Norfolk, Portsmouth, Petersburg, and elsewhere). Davis also suspended the writ in East Tennessee; in this region, Thomas A.R. Nelson was arrested by the Confederate military and held as a political prisoner before being released on the condition that he cease criticizing the Confederate government. Suspensions of civil process in the confederacy were used against suspected Unionists, particularly in border states. Historian Barton A. Myers notes that after the Confederacy imposed nationwide conscription, \"the difference between arrest for political dissidence and conscription into the military became largely semantic, as anyone accused of Unionism was almost always first taken to a training camp where they were monitored and hazed under guard.\"\n\nDavis also suspended the writ in North Carolina (June 1862) and in Atlanta (in September 1862). The Confederate Congress passed re-authorizing legislation twice more, in October 1862 and February 1864. Davis suspended habeas corpus in Arkansas and the Indian Territory in January 1863. Although Davis had initially been resistant to the idea, he suspended the writ after receiving a telegram from General Theophilus Holmes complaining that his region was filed with disloyal persons and deserters, and that he could not enforce conscription.\n\nAt least 2,672 civilians were subject to military arrest in the Confederacy over the course of its history; although this is likely an undercount given the incompleteness of records. Civil War historian Mark E. Neely Jr. suggests that \"there seems to be no difference in the arrest rate in those periods when the Confederate Congress refuse to authorization suspension of the writ of habeas corpus and those periods was authorized. ... civilian prisoners trickled into Confederate military prisons whether the writ of habeas corpus was suspended or not.\"\n\nThe last suspension lapsed in August 1864, amid deep domestic opposition to the suspension, including from the Confederate vice president Alexander H. Stephens, Davis's political rival. Citing \"discontent, disaffection, and disloyalty,\" Davis made entreaties in late 1864 and 1865 about the necessity of suspension, but bills to further suspend habeas corpus failed in the Confederate Senate.\n\nFollowing the end of the Civil War, numerous groups arose in the South to oppose Reconstruction, including the Ku Klux Klan. In response, Congress passed the Enforcement Acts in 1870–71. One of these, the Civil Rights Act of 1871, permitted the president to suspend habeas corpus if conspiracies against federal authority were so violent that they could not be checked by ordinary means. That same year, President Ulysses S. Grant suspended the writ of habeas corpus in nine South Carolina counties; the Act's sunset clause ended that suspension with the close of the next regular session of Congress.\n\nIn response to continuing unrest, the Philippine Commission availed itself of an option in the Philippine Organic Act of 1902, , and on January 31, 1905, requested that Governor-General Luke Edward Wright suspend the writ of habeas corpus. He did so the same day, and habeas corpus was suspended until he revoked his proclamation on October 15, 1905. The suspension gave rise to the United States Supreme Court case \"Fischer v. Baker\", .\n\nImmediately following the attack on Pearl Harbor, the governor of Hawaii Territory, Joseph Poindexter, at the specific request by LG Walter Short, US Army, invoked the Hawaiian Organic Act, (1900), suspended habeas corpus, and declared martial law. General Short was recalled to Washington, DC two weeks after the attack and subsequently Hawaii was governed by US Army Lieutenant Generals Delos Emmons, and Robert C. Richardson, Jr. for the remainder of the war. In \"Duncan v. Kahanamoku\", , the United States Supreme Court held that the declaration of martial law did not permit the trial of civilians in military tribunals for offenses unrelated to the military (in this case, public drunkenness).\n\nIn 1942, eight German saboteurs, including two U.S. citizens, who had secretly entered the United States to attack its civil infrastructure as part of Operation Pastorius were convicted by a secret military tribunal set up by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In \"Ex parte Quirin\" (1942), the U.S. Supreme Court decided that the writ of \"habeas corpus\" did not apply, and that the military tribunal had jurisdiction to try the saboteurs, due to their status as unlawful combatants.\n\nThe period of martial law in Hawaii ended in October 1944. It was held in \"Duncan v. Kahanamoku\" (1946) that although the initial imposition of martial law in December 1941 may have been lawful, due to the Pearl Harbor attack and threat of imminent invasion, by 1944 the imminent threat had receded and civilian courts could again function in Hawaii. The Organic Act therefore did not authorize the military to continue to keep civilian courts closed.\n\nAfter the end of the war, several German prisoners held in American-occupied Germany petitioned the District Court for the District of Columbia for a writ of \"habeas corpus\". In \"Johnson v. Eisentrager\" (1950) the U.S. Supreme Court decided that the American court system had no jurisdiction over German war criminals who had been captured in Germany, and had never entered U.S. soil.\n\nIn 1996, following the Oklahoma City bombing, Congress passed (91–8 in the Senate, 293–133 in the House) and President Clinton signed into law the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). The AEDPA was intended to \"deter terrorism, provide justice for victims, provide for an effective death penalty, and for other purposes.\" The AEDPA introduced one of the few limitations on \"habeas corpus\". For the first time, its Section 101 set a statute of limitations of one year following conviction for prisoners to seek the writ. The Act limits the power of federal judges to grant relief unless the state court's adjudication of the claim has resulted in a decision that\n\n\nIt barred second or successive petitions generally but with several exceptions. Petitioners who had already filed a federal \"habeas\" petition were required first to secure authorization from the appropriate United States Court of Appeals, to ensure that such an exception was at least facially made out.\n\nThe November 13, 2001, Presidential Military Order purported to give the President of the United States the power to detain non-citizens suspected of connection to terrorists or terrorism as enemy combatants. As such, that person could be held indefinitely, without charges being filed against him or her, without a court hearing, and without legal counsel. Many legal and constitutional scholars contended that these provisions were in direct opposition to \"habeas corpus\", and the United States Bill of Rights and, indeed, in \"Hamdi v. Rumsfeld\" (2004) the U.S. Supreme Court re-confirmed the right of every American citizen to access \"habeas corpus\" even when declared to be an enemy combatant. The Court affirmed the basic principle that \"habeas corpus\" could not be revoked in the case of a citizen.\n\nIn \"Hamdan v. Rumsfeld\" (2006) Salim Ahmed Hamdan petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, challenging that the military commissions set up by the Bush administration to try detainees at Guantanamo Bay \"violate both the UCMJ and the four Geneva Conventions.\" In a 5-3 ruling the Court rejected Congress's attempts to strip the court of jurisdiction over habeas corpus appeals by detainees at Guantánamo Bay. Congress had previously passed the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2006 which stated in Section 1005(e), \"Procedures for Status Review of Detainees Outside the United States\":\n\nOn September 29, the U.S. House and Senate approved the Military Commissions Act of 2006, a bill which suspended habeas corpus for any alien determined to be an \"unlawful enemy combatant engaged in hostilities or having supported hostilities against the United States\" by a vote of 65-34. (This was the result on the bill to approve the military trials for detainees; an amendment to remove the suspension of \"habeas corpus\" failed 48-51.) President Bush signed the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA) into law on October 17, 2006. With the MCA's passage, the law altered the language from \"alien detained ... at Guantanamo Bay\":\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in \"Boumediene v. Bush\" that the MCA amounts to an unconstitutional encroachment on \"habeas corpus\" rights, and established jurisdiction for federal courts to hear petitions for \"habeas corpus\" from Guantanamo detainees tried under the Act. Under the MCA, the law restricted \"habeas\" appeals for only those aliens detained as enemy combatants, or awaiting such determination. Left unchanged was the provision that, after such determination is made, it is subject to appeal in federal courts, including a review of whether the evidence warrants the determination. If the status was upheld, then their imprisonment was deemed lawful; if not, then the government could change the prisoner's status to something else, at which point the \"habeas\" restrictions no longer applied.\nThere is, however, no legal time limit which would force the government to provide a Combatant Status Review Tribunal hearing. Prisoners were, but are no longer, legally prohibited from petitioning any court for any reason before a CSRT hearing takes place.\n\nIn January 2007, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales told the Senate Judiciary Committee that in his opinion: \"There is no express grant of \"habeas\" in the Constitution. There's a prohibition against taking it away.\" He was challenged by Sen. Arlen Specter who asked him to explain how it is possible to prohibit something from being taken away, without first being granted. Robert Parry wrote in the Baltimore Chronicle & Sentinel:\n\nThe Department of Justice has taken the position in litigation that the Military Commissions Act of 2006 does not amount to a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit agreed in a 2-1 decision, on February 20, 2007, which the U.S. Supreme Court initially declined to review. The U.S. Supreme Court then reversed its decision to deny review and took up the case in June 2007. In June 2008, the court ruled 5-4 that the act did suspend \"habeas\" and found it unconstitutional.\n\nOn June 7, 2007, the Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2007 was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee with an 11–8 vote split along party lines, with all but one Republican voting against it. Although the Act would restore statutory habeas corpus to enemy combatants, it would not overturn the provisions of the AEDPA which set a statute of limitations on habeas corpus claims from ordinary civilian federal and state prisoners.\n\nOn June 11, 2007, a federal appeals court ruled that Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri, a legal resident of the United States, could not be detained indefinitely without charge. In a two-to-one ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, the Court held the President of the United States lacks legal authority to detain al-Marri without charge; all three judges ruled that al-Marri is entitled to traditional habeas corpus protections which give him the right to challenge his detainment in a U.S. Court.\n\nIn July 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled that \"if properly designated an enemy combatant pursuant to the legal authority of the President, such persons may be detained without charge or criminal proceedings for the duration of the relevant hostilities.\"\n\nOn October 7, 2008, U.S. District Judge Ricardo M. Urbina ruled that 17 Uyghurs, Muslims from China's northwestern Xinjiang region, must be brought to appear in his court in Washington, DC, three days later:\n\"Because the Constitution prohibits indefinite detentions without cause, the continued detention is unlawful.\"\n\nOn January 21, 2009, President Barack Obama issued an executive order regarding the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and the individuals held there. This order stated that the detainees \"have the constitutional privilege of the writ of habeas corpus.\"\nFollowing the December 1, 2011, vote by the United States Senate to reject an NDAA amendment proscribing the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens, the ACLU has argued that the legitimacy of \"Habeas Corpus\" is threatened:\n\"The Senate voted 38-60 to reject an important amendment [that] would have removed harmful provisions authorizing the U.S. military to pick up and imprison without charge or trial civilians, including American citizens, anywhere in the world... We're disappointed that, despite robust opposition to the harmful detention legislation from virtually the entire national security leadership of the government, the Senate said 'no' to the Udall amendment and 'yes' to indefinite detention without charge or trial.\" \"The New York Times\" has stated that the vote leaves the constitutional rights of U.S. citizens \"ambiguous,\" with some senators including Carl Levin and Lindsey Graham arguing that the Supreme Court had already approved holding Americans as enemy combatants, and other senators, including Dianne Feinstein and Richard Durbin, asserting the opposite.\n\nOn April 20, 2015, a New York Supreme Court justice issued an order to \"show cause & writ of \"habeas corpus\"\" in a proceeding on behalf of two chimpanzees used in research at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. The justice, Barbara Jaffe, amended her order later in the day by striking the reference to \"habeas corpus\".\n\nHabeas corpus is an action often taken after sentencing by a defendant who seeks relief for some perceived error in his criminal trial. There are a number of such post-trial actions and proceedings, their differences being potentially confusing, thus bearing some explanation. Some of the most common are an appeal to which the defendant has as a right, a writ of certiorari, a writ coram nobis and a writ of habeas corpus.\n\nAn appeal to which the defendant has a right cannot be abridged by the court which is, by designation of its jurisdiction, obligated to hear the appeal. In such an appeal, the appellant feels that some error has been made in his trial, necessitating an appeal. A matter of importance is the basis on which such an appeal might be filed: generally appeals as a matter of right may only address issues which were originally raised in trial (as evidenced by documentation in the official record). Any issue not raised in the original trial may not be considered on appeal and will be considered waived via estoppel. A convenient test for whether a petition is likely to succeed on the grounds of error is confirming that\n\nA writ of certiorari, otherwise known simply as cert, is an order by a higher court directing a lower court to send record of a case for review, and is the next logical step in post-trial procedure. While states may have similar processes, a writ of cert is usually only issued, in the United States, by the Supreme Court, although some states retain this procedure. Unlike the aforementioned appeal, a writ of cert is not a matter of right. A writ of cert will have to be petitioned for, the higher court issuing such writs on limited bases according to constraints such as time. In another sense, a writ of cert is like an appeal in its constraints; it too may only seek relief on grounds raised in the original trial.\n\nA petition for a writ of error coram nobis or error coram vobis challenges a final judgment in a criminal proceeding. Use of this type of petition varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but is usually limited to situations where it was not possible to raise this issue earlier on direct appeal. These petitions focus on issues outside the original premises of the trial, i.e., issues that require new evidence or those that could not otherwise be raised by direct appeal or writs of cert. These often fall in two logical categories: (1) that the trial lawyer was ineffectual or incompetent or (2) that some constitutional right has been violated.\n\nIn 2004, there were about 19,000 non-capital federal habeas corpus petitions filed and there were about 210 capital federal habeas corpus petitions filed in U.S. District Court. The vast majority of these were from state prisoners, not from those held in federal prisons. There are about 60 habeas corpus cases filed in the U.S. Supreme Court's original jurisdiction each year. The U.S. Courts of Appeal do not have original jurisdiction over habeas corpus petitions.\n\nIn 1992, less than 1% of federal habeas corpus petitions involved death penalty sentences, although 21% involved life sentences. At that time about 23% had been convicted of homicide, about 39% had been convicted of other serious violent crimes, about 27% had been convicted of serious non-violent crimes, and about 12% were convicted of other offenses. These are almost exclusively state offenses and thus petitions filed by state prisoners.\n\nExhaustion of state-court remedies often takes five to ten years after a conviction, so only state prisoners facing longer prison sentences are able to avail themselves of federal habeas corpus rights without facing a summary dismissal for failure to exhaust state remedies. The lack of state remedies to exhaust also means that the timeline for federal death penalty habeas review is much shorter than the timeline for state death penalty habeas review (which can drag on literally for decades).\n\nIn 2004, the percentage of federal habeas corpus petitions involving state death sentences was still about 1% of the total.\n\nAbout 63% of issues raised in habeas corpus petitions by state court prisoners are dismissed on procedural grounds at the U.S. District Court level, and about 35% of those issues are dismissed based on the allegations in the petition on the merits (on the merits has a different meaning than what it's used for here). About 2% are either \"remanded\" to a state court for further proceedings (which poses an interesting problem of federalism – the federal court usually issues a writ to the state prison to release the prisoner, but only if the state court does not hold a certain proceeding within a certain time), or, far less frequently, resolved favorably to the prisoner on the merits outright. About 57% of habeas corpus issues dismissed on procedural grounds in 1992 were dismissed for a failure to exhaust state remedies.\n\nSuccess rates are not uniform, however. James Liebman, Professor of Law at Columbia Law School, stated in 1996 that his study found that when habeas corpus petitions in death penalty cases were traced from conviction to completion of the case that there was \"a 40 percent success rate in all capital cases from 1978 to 1995.\" Similarly, a study by Ronald Tabek in a law review article puts the success rate in habeas corpus cases involving death row inmates even higher, finding that between \"1976 and 1991, approximately 47% of the habeas petitions filed by death row inmates were granted.\" Most habeas corpus petitioners in death penalty cases are represented by attorneys, but most habeas corpus petitioners in non-death penalty cases represent themselves. This is because federal funds are not available to non-capital state habeas petitioners to pay for attorneys unless there is good cause, there being no federal right to counsel in such matters. However, in state capital cases, the federal government provides funding for the representation of all capital habeas petitioners.\n\nThus, about 20% of successful habeas corpus petitions involve death penalty cases.\n\nThese success rates predate major revisions in habeas corpus law that restricted the availability of federal habeas corpus relief when AEDPA was adopted in 1996, over a decade ago. Post-AEDPA, the great disparity in success rates remains, however, with the federal courts' overturning of state capital cases a major reason that many states have been unable to carry out a majority of capital sentences imposed and have long backlog lists.\n\nThe time required to adjudicate habeas corpus petitions varies greatly based upon factors including the number of issues raised, whether the adjudication is on procedural grounds or on the merits, and the nature of the claims raised.\n\nIn 1992, U.S. District Courts took an average of two and a half years to adjudicate habeas corpus petitions in death penalty cases raising multiple issues that were resolved on the merits, about half of that time-length for other multiple issue homicide cases, and about nine months in cases resolved on procedural grounds.\n\nAEDPA was designed to reduce the disposition times of federal habeas corpus petitions. But AEDPA has a little impact in non-capital cases, where a majority of cases are dismissed on procedural grounds, very few prisoners prevail and most prisoners are not represented by attorneys. The disposition time in capital cases has actually increased 250% from the time of AEDPA's passage to 2004.\n\nIn 1991, the average number of federal habeas corpus petitions filed in the United States was 14 per 1,000 people in state prison, but this ranged greatly from state to state from a low of 4 per 1,000 in Rhode Island to a high of 37 per 1,000 in Missouri.\n\nThe Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) produced a brief surge in the number of habeas corpus filings by state prisoners, as deadlines imposed by the act encouraged prisoners to file sooner than they might have otherwise done so, but this had run its course by 2000, and by 2004, habeas corpus petition filing rates per 1,000 prisoners was similar to pre-AEDPA filing rates.\n\nThere was a temporary surge in habeas corpus petitions filed by federal prisoners in 2005 as a result of the \"Booker\" decision by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\n\n"}

For instance, a state park which is dependent on visitor fees for operation could divide the yearly operational cost by the number of expected user days, and charge a daily tax or fee based on that calculation. This fee for service is directly calculated.\n\nA city could have multiple services and social welfare expenditures—police, fire, library, refuse removal, and emergency food and housing support—and the exact service to individual taxpayers in those areas might be difficult or impossible to track. The city, however, can set a standard such as number of residential occupants, employee number, or developed land space, and then approximate service cost based on those conditions and set a commensurate tax assessment. An implied level of government service for city services still exists, but is approximated.\n\nA city resident may rarely use the library, never have to call the police or fire departments, and never need welfare assistance. But the resident still benefits, indirectly, from the service availability, social order, and economic stability those city services provide. As long as the assessment calculation is logical and proportional, the assessment would be related to an implied level of government service. \nThe concept of implied level of government service is related to the benefits principle of equity, where the proceeds of a tax are directly allocated to a corresponding government service—such as a gas tax financing construction and maintenance of roads. Both implied level of government service and the benefits principle are related to the concept of rational economic exchange.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12865408", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12865408", "title": "Impracticability", "text": "Impracticability\n\nThe doctrine of impracticability in the common law of contracts excuses performance of a duty, where that duty has become unfeasibly difficult or expensive for the party who was to perform.\n\nImpracticability is similar in some respects to the doctrine of impossibility because it is triggered by the occurrence of a condition which prevents one party from fulfilling the contract. The major difference between the two doctrines is that while impossibility excuses performance where the contractual duty cannot physically be performed, the doctrine of impracticability comes into play where performance is still physically possible, but would be extremely burdensome for the party whose performance is due. Thus, impossibility is an objective condition, whereas impracticability is a subjective condition for a court to determine.\n\nTypically, the test U.S. courts use for impracticability is as follows (with a few variations among different jurisdictions):\n\n\nSection 261 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts does not explicitly define the scope of what is considered impracticable, as it is a fairly subjective and fact-intensive test for the courts. Generally, courts do not consider events such as an increase in price or costs beyond a normal range to allow for discharge of duties on grounds of impracticability, as such events are normally foreseeable risks of fixed-price contracts.\n\nSection 2-615 of the Uniform Commercial Code deals with impracticability in the context of sales of goods, and introduces some additional constraints on the parties. A party whose ability to perform his obligations has only been partially affected must allocate production and delivery among his customers in a manner which is fair and reasonable, affording each of them with partial performance, and must notify all purchasers that there will be delay, partial delivery, or non-delivery. This is similar in some respects to the doctrine of general average in admiralty law.\n\nAccording to note 4 under UCC 2-615, increased cost alone does not excuse performance unless the rise in cost is due to some unforeseen contingency which alters the nature of performance. It further explains that a change in market conditions resulting in a rise or drop in prices is not sufficient to claim impracticability because the parties assumed that risk when the contract was made. The comments indicate that contingencies such as war, embargo, crop failures, or a failure of a major source of supply that causes the market change or prevents a seller from obtaining supplies necessary for his performance would justify a claim of impracticability.\n\n"}

It became an official United Nations document in 1999.\n\nThe Istanbul Protocol is intended to serve as a set of international guidelines for the assessment of persons who allege torture and ill treatment, for investigating cases of alleged torture, and for reporting such findings to the judiciary and any other investigative body.\n\nThe Manual on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment contains internationally recognised standards and procedures on how to recognise and document symptoms of torture so the documentation may serve as valid evidence in court.\n\nAs such, the Istanbul Protocol provides useful guidance for doctors and lawyers who want to investigate whether or not a person has been tortured and report the findings to the judiciary and any other investigative bodies.\n\nThe Istanbul Protocol is a non-binding document. However, international law obliges governments to investigate and document incidents of torture and other forms of ill-treatment and to punish those responsible in a comprehensive, effective, prompt and impartial manner. The Istanbul Protocol is a tool for doing this.\n\nThe Istanbul Protocol was drafted by more than 75 experts in law, health and human rights during three years of collective effort. While the extensive work was initiated and coordinated by the Human Rights Foundation of Turkey (HRFT) and the Physicians for Human Rights USA (PHR USA), it involved more than 40 different organisations, such as the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims. \n\nThe initial steps to work on a manual for the investigation and documentation of torture and other forms of ill treatment were taken at an international meeting in 1996 organised by the Turkish Medical Association and were inspired by the daily needs and practices experienced by the HRFT and the Society of Forensic Medicine Specialists in Turkey. In particular, the efforts to investigate the death of Baki Erdogan during custody became a decisive factor.\n\nBaki Erdogan died during his 11th day in custody after having been transferred to the state hospital in Turkey. The autopsy and official forensic report stated that as a result of a 10-day hunger strike, he died of acute pulmonary oedema.\n\nThe Turkish Medical Association carried out an independent investigation and submitted an alternative medical report which disclosed numerous flaws in the autopsy and medical assessment made by the official medical experts.\n\nThe point of reference for the development of the alternative medical report was the Minnesota Protocol, the United Nations, Model Protocol for a Legal Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions, Doc. ST/CSDHA/12, created in response to the conclusion of the Special Rapporteur on Summary or Arbitrary Executions, appointed by the Economic and Social Council in 1982.\n\nThe alternative report stressed that the official forensic investigation was deficient and false and not in accordance with the standards set out in the Minnesota Protocol. Furthermore, in light of the collected evidence and other findings, the cause of death was determined to be Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a result of the use of torture.\n\nUpon finalisation of the Istanbul Protocol in 1999, an article on the Protocol was published in the international medical journal \"The Lancet\".\n\nThe Istanbul Protocol is published by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in its Professional Training Series in the six official UN languages.\n\nThe Istanbul Protocol was submitted to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on 9 August 1999. Both the UN General Assembly and the then UN Commission on Human Rights (since 2006, the UN Human Rights Council) have strongly encouraged states to reflect upon the Principles in the Protocol as a useful tool to combat torture.\n\nThe UN Special Rapporteur on Torture stressed in his General Recommendations of 2003 the importance of the Istanbul Principles in the context of establishing independent national authorities for investigation; promptness and independence of investigations; independence of forensic medical services by governmental investigatory bodies and obtaining forensic evidence.\n\nOn 23 April 2003, the UN Commission on Human Rights, in its resolution on human rights and forensic science, drew the attention of governments to these principles as a useful tool in combating torture. Likewise, reference was made to the Istanbul Protocol in the resolution on the competence of national investigative authorities in preventing torture.\n\nIn addition to recognition by the UN system, the Istanbul Protocol has also been adopted by several regional bodies.\n\nThe African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights deliberated on the importance of the Istanbul Protocol during its 32nd ordinary session in October 2002 and concluded that investigations of all allegations of torture or ill-treatment, shall be conducted promptly, impartially and effectively, and be guided by the Istanbul Principles.\n\nThe European Union has referred to the Istanbul Protocol in its \"Guidelines to EU Policy towards Third Countries on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment\" adopted by the General Affairs Council in 2001. The EU guidelines mention that states should \"“conduct prompt, impartial and effective investigations of all allegations of torture in accordance with the Istanbul Rules annexed to CHR resolution 2000/43”\" and should \"“establish and operate effective domestic procedures for responding to and investigating complaints and reports of torture and ill-treatment in accordance with the Istanbul Rules.”\"\n\nOther institutions and organisations have reiterated the UN and other bodies’ recommendations in their reports, statements, and comments (including the Advisory Council of Jurists and the Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions). These references can roughly be summarised into three categories:\n\n\n\n\n"}

Others have much more severe penalties such as some Asian and Middle Eastern countries where possession of even small amounts is punished by imprisonment for several years. \n\nUruguay and Canada are the only countries that have fully legalized the consumption and sale of recreational cannabis nationwide. In the United States, ten states and the District of Columbia have legalized sales and consumption although it remains federally illegal.

A policy of limited enforcement has also been adopted in many countries, in particular Spain and the Netherlands where the sale of cannabis is tolerated at licensed establishments.\n\nCountries that have legalized the medical use of cannabis include Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Peru, Poland, Sri Lanka and the United Kingdom.

Almost the whole country followed suit, with the Swedes entering Warsaw unopposed in August 1655 and John Casimir fleeing to Silesia, where he took refuge in the town of Oberglogau () staying there in a local castle from October 17, 1655 until December 18 of the same year.\n\nHowever several places still resisted, most remarkably (and symbolically) the monastery at Jasna Góra (November 1655 to January 1656). The defense of Jasna Góra galvanized Polish resistance against the Swedes, as aggression on that place, perceived by Catholic Poles as the most holy sanctuary, rose massive anti-Swedish sentiments. In December 1655 the Tyszowce Confederation formed in support of the exiled John Casimir.\n\nSpontaneous uprisings started all over the country, attacking the dispersed occupation forces — who, in their turn, retaliated. The uprisings soon merged under the leadership of Polish military leaders Stefan Czarniecki and Grand Hetman of Lithuania Paweł Jan Sapieha, who started organized counterattacks in order to eliminate those loyal to Charles Gustav.\n\nConsidering these facts, John II Casimir decided to return. Trying to pass Swedish troops unexposed, he rode with only small host, from Silesia through Carpathian Mountains, finally reaching Lwów in March 1656.\n\nAs almost the whole country was occupied by the Swedish or Russian armies, the reason behind the vow was to incite the whole nation, including peasantry in the first place, to rise up against the invaders. Thus two main issues raised by the king in the vows were primarily - a necessity to protect the Catholic faith, seen as endangered by the Lutheran (and to some point Orthodox) aggressors, secondly - to manifest the will to improve the peasantry's condition.\n\nOn 1 April 1656, during a holy mass in Lwów's Cathedral, conducted by the papal legate Pietro Vidoni, John Casimir in a grandiose and elaborate ceremony entrusted the Commonwealth under the Blessed Virgin Mary's protection, whom he announced as \"The Queen of the Polish Crown and other of his countries\". He also swore to \"protect the Kingdom's folk from any impositions and unjust bondage\".\n\nToday, the Blessed Virgin Mary is known as the Queen of Poland.\n\nAfter the King, similar vow was taken by the Deputy Chancellor of the Crown and the bishop of Kraków Andrzej Trzebicki in the name of the szlachta noblemen of the Commonwealth.\n\nThe Commonwealth forces finally drove back the Swedes in 1657 and the Russians in 1661. After the war, promises made by John Casimir in Lwów, especially those considering peasants' lot, were not fulfilled, mostly because of Sejm's objection, which represented the szlachta nobility, not attracted to the idea of reducing serfdom, which would negatively affect their economical interests.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18773335", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18773335", "title": "Microsoft litigation", "text": "Microsoft litigation\n\nMicrosoft has been involved in numerous high-profile legal matters that involved litigation over the history of the company, including cases against the United States, the European Union, and competitors.\n\nIn its 2008 annual report, Microsoft stated:\n\nIn the 1990s, Microsoft adopted exclusionary licensing under which PC manufacturers were required to pay for an MS-DOS license even when the system shipped with an alternative operating system. Critics attest that it also used predatory tactics to price its competitors out of the market and that Microsoft erected technical barriers to make it appear that competing products did not work on its operating system. In a consent decree filed on July 15, 1994, Microsoft agreed to a deal under which, among other things, the company would not make the sale of its operating systems conditional on the purchase of any other Microsoft product. On February 14, 1995 Judge Stanley Sporkin issued a 45-page opinion that the consent decree was not in the public interest. Later that spring, a three-judge federal appeals panel removed Sporkin and reassigned the consent decree. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson entered the decree on August 21, 1995, three days before the launch of Windows 95.\n\nA Microsoft purchase of Intuit was scuttled in 1994 due to antitrust concerns that Microsoft would be purchasing a major competitor.\n\nAfter bundling the Internet Explorer web browser into its Windows operating system in the late 1990s (without requiring a separate purchase) and acquiring a dominant share in the web browser market, the antitrust case \"United States v. Microsoft\" was brought against the company. In a series of rulings by judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, the company was found to have violated its earlier consent decree and abused its monopoly in the desktop operating systems market. The \"findings of fact\" during the antitrust case established that Microsoft has a monopoly in the PC desktop operating systems market:\n\nViewed together, three main facts indicate that Microsoft enjoys monopoly power. First, Microsoft's share of the market for Intel-compatible PC operating systems is extremely large and stable. Second, Microsoft's dominant market share is protected by a high barrier to entry. Third, and largely as a result of that barrier, Microsoft's customers lack a commercially viable alternative to Windows. (III.34)\n\nThe findings of fact go on to explain the nature of the \"barrier to entry\":\n\nThe fact that there is a multitude of people using Windows makes the product more attractive to consumers. The large installed base... impels ISVs (independent software vendors) to write applications first and foremost to Windows, thereby ensuring a large body of applications from which consumers can choose. The large body of applications thus reinforces demand for Windows, augmenting Microsoft's dominant position and thereby perpetuating ISV incentives to write applications principally for Windows... The small or non-existent market share of an aspiring competitor makes it prohibitively expensive for the aspirant to develop its PC operating system into an acceptable substitute for Windows. (III.39–40)\n\nThe proposed remedy (dividing Microsoft into two companies) was never applied. The judge who decided the original case was removed from the decision concerning the penalty due to public statements, and replaced by a judge more sympathetic to Microsoft. While new penalties were under consideration, the Clinton administration ended and the Bush administration took office. The new administration announced that in the interest of ending the case as quickly as possible, it would no longer seek to break the company up, and that it would stop investigating claims of illegal tying of products. Eighteen days later, Judge Kollar-Kotelly ordered the justice department and Microsoft to \"engage in discussions seven days a week, 24 hours a day.\" The judge cited the events of September 11, 2001, in her direction to begin settlement talks but did not explain the linkage between the two. Attorney General Ashcroft, however, denied that the events of September 11 had any effect on the outcome. Microsoft subsequently reached a settlement with the Department of Justice and some of the states which brought suit against it. Several class-action lawsuits filed after the conviction are still pending.\n\nIn early 2002, Microsoft proposed to settle the private lawsuits by donating $1 billion USD in money, software, services, and training, including Windows licenses and refurbished PCs, to about 12,500 underprivileged public schools. This was seen by the judge as a potential windfall for Microsoft, not only in educating schoolchildren on Microsoft solutions but also in flooding the market with Microsoft products. Among the protesters were Apple Inc. which feared further loss of its educational market share. The federal judge rejected the proposed settlement.\n\nIn 2003 to 2004, the European Commission investigated the bundling of Windows Media Player into Windows, a practice which rivals complained was destroying the market for their own products. Negotiations between Microsoft and the Commission broke down in March 2004, and the company was subsequently handed down a record fine of €497 million ($666 million) for its breaches of EU competition law. Separate investigations into alleged abuses of the server market were also ongoing at the same time. On December 22, 2004, the European Court decided that the measures imposed on Microsoft by the European Commission would not be delayed, as was requested by Microsoft while waiting for the appeal. Microsoft has since paid a €497 million fine, shipped versions of Windows without Windows Media Player, and licensed many of the protocols used in its products to developers in countries within the European Economic Area. However, the European Commission has charactized the much delayed protocol licensing as unreasonable, called Microsoft \"non-compliant\" and still violating antitrust law in 2007, and said that its RAND terms were above market prices; in addition, they said software patents covering the code \"lack significant innovation\", which Microsoft and the EC had agreed would determine licensing fees. Microsoft responded by saying, that other government agencies had found \"considerable innovation\". Microsoft appealed the facts and ruling to the European Court of First Instance with hearings in September 2006.\n\nIn 2000, a group of customers and business filed a class action suit in \"Comes v. Microsoft Corp.\", alleging that Microsoft violated Iowa's antitrust laws by engaging in monopolistic practices. In 2002, the Iowa Supreme Court ruled that indirect purchasers (consumers who purchased computers from a third-party, with Microsoft's software pre-installed in the computer) could be included as members of the class in the class action suit. On remand, the trial court certified two classes of plaintiffs, and the Iowa Supreme Court ultimately affirmed the class certification. In August 2007, the parties ultimately reached a settlement valued at $179.95 million.\n\nOn September 17, 2007, the EU Court of First Instance rejected Microsoft's appeal.\n\nThe court affirmed the original contested finding:\n\nAll elements of Microsoft's appeal were dismissed.\n\nMicrosoft accepted the judgment of the Court of First Instance and proceeded to make available interoperability information as originally required by the European Commission.\n\nMicrosoft also faced competition law in South Korea and was fined $32 million in December 2005 and ordered to unbundle instant messaging, Windows Media Player and Windows Media Service, or let competitors' products take their place. Microsoft noted in their October 2005 SEC filing that they may have to pull out of South Korea, although they later denied fulfilling such a plan. Microsoft's 2006 appeal was struck down; they have another appeal pending.\n\nEuropean antitrust regulators on February 27, 2008 fined Microsoft $1.3 billion for failing to comply with a 2004 judgment, that the company had abused its market dominance. The new fine by the European Commission was the largest it has ever imposed on an individual company, and brings the total in fines imposed on Microsoft to about $US 2.5 billion, at current exchange rates.\n\nMicrosoft had previously been fined after the commission determined in 2004 that the company had abused the dominance of its Windows operating system to gain unfair market advantage. The commission imposing the new fine said, that it was because the company had not met the prescribed remedies after the earlier judgment.\n\nThe European Union Microsoft competition case is a case brought by the European Commission of the European Union (EU) against Microsoft for abuse of its dominant position in the market (according to competition law). It started as a complaint from Novell over Microsoft's licensing practices in 1993, and eventually resulted in the EU ordering Microsoft to divulge certain information about its server products and release a version of Microsoft Windows without Windows Media Player.\n\nOn February 27, 2008 the European Union (EU) competitions commission announced its decision to fine the Microsoft Corporation €899 million (US$1.35 billion), approximately 1/10 of the company's net yearly earnings, for failing to comply with the 2004 antitrust order.\n\nThe first decision in this antitrust case was given in 2004 citing that Microsoft withheld needed interoperability information from rival software companies which prevented them from making software compatible with Windows. The commission ordered Microsoft to provide this information. Microsoft agreed to this, providing the information for royalty fees of 6.85% of the licensee's revenues for the product on grounds of innovation (specifically, 3.87% for the patent license and of 2.98% for the information license). The EU found these royalty fees unreasonable and Microsoft was ordered to lower them. Microsoft complied with this, adjusting the royalty rates to 1.2% (changing the rates for the licenses to 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively) in the European Union, while keeping the rate the same for the rest of the world. The EU still saw this as an unreasonable rate, and Microsoft, two months after lowering the rates, reduced the rates yet again to a flat rate of €10,000 or a royalty of 0.4% applicable worldwide. Microsoft's royalty rates, which were deemed unreasonable for the period of 15 months between June 21, 2006 and October 21, 2007 are the cause for the fine. So far, the EU has fined Microsoft €1.68 billion in 3 separate fines in this case. This fine will go towards the European Union annual budget.\n\nThe European Anti-trust commissioner Neelie Kroes stated that the fine was \"reasonable and proportionate,\" as the figure could have gone up as high as €1.5 billion, the maximum that the EU commission can impose. She also said that it should act as \"a signal to the outside world, and especially Microsoft, that they should stick to the rules\" and that \"Talk is cheap. Flouting the rules is expensive.\" Although she also expressed hope that \"today's decision closes a dark chapter in Microsoft's record of non-compliance with the Commission.\"\n\nIt is not certain whether Microsoft will appeal this decision. A Microsoft spokesperson has stated that Microsoft will review this latest fine, citing that \"The commission announced in October 2007 that Microsoft was in full compliance with the 2004 decision, so these fines are about the past issues that have been resolved.\" Microsoft's General Counsel Brad Smith commented \"It's clearly very important to us as a company that we comply with our obligations under European law. We will study this decision carefully, and if there are additional steps that we need to take in order to comply with it, we will take them.\" Microsoft had appealed against fines by the EU before, but all the charges were defeated. If Microsoft does not appeal the decision, the company will have 3 months (starting February 27) to pay the fine in full.\n\nThe decisions came after Microsoft announced they were disclosing 30,000 pages of previously secret software code last Thursday (February 21). The EU competition commissioner commented that this move \"does not necessarily equal a change in business practice.\"\n\nIn September 2011, the competition commission in Spain began an investigation into Microsoft's licence agreements, which prevent the transfer of Microsoft software to third parties.\n\n\"United States v. Microsoft Corp.\", 87 F. Supp. 2d 30 (D.D.C. 2000) was a set of consolidated civil actions filed against Microsoft Corporation on May 18, 1998 by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and twenty U.S. states. Joel I. Klein was the lead prosecutor. The plaintiffs alleged that Microsoft abused monopoly power in its handling of operating system sales and web browser sales. The issue central to the case was whether Microsoft was allowed to bundle its flagship Internet Explorer (IE) web browser software with its Microsoft Windows operating system. Bundling them together is alleged to have been responsible for Microsoft's victory in the browser wars as every Windows user had a copy of Internet Explorer. It was further alleged that this unfairly restricted the market for competing web browsers (such as Netscape Navigator or Opera) that were slow to download over a modem or had to be purchased at a store. Underlying these disputes were questions over whether Microsoft altered or manipulated its application programming interfaces (APIs) to favor Internet Explorer over third party web browsers, Microsoft's conduct in forming restrictive licensing agreements with OEM computer manufacturers, and Microsoft's intent in its course of conduct.\n\nMicrosoft stated that the merging of Microsoft Windows and Internet Explorer was the result of innovation and competition, that the two were now the same product and were inextricably linked together and that consumers were now getting all the benefits of IE for free. Those who opposed Microsoft's position countered that the browser was still a distinct and separate product which did not need to be tied to the operating system, since a separate version of Internet Explorer was available for Mac OS. They also asserted that IE was not really free because its development and marketing costs may have kept the price of Windows higher than it might otherwise have been. The case was tried before U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson. The DOJ was initially represented by David Boies. On June 30, 2004, the U.S. appeals court unanimously approved the settlement with the Justice Department, rejecting objections that the sanctions were inadequate.\n\nIn March 2004, during a consumer class-action lawsuit in Minnesota, internal documents subpoenaed from Microsoft revealed that the company had violated nondisclosure agreements seven years earlier in obtaining business plans from Go Corporation, using them to develop and announce a competing product named PenWindows, and convincing Intel to reduce its investment in Go. After Go was purchased by AT&T and Go's tablet-based computing efforts were shelved, PenWindows development was dropped.\n\nIn May 2004, a class-action lawsuit accused Microsoft of overcharging customers in the state of California. The company settled the case for $1.1 billion, and a California court ordered Microsoft to pay an additional $258 million in legal fees (including over $3,000 per hour for the lead attorney in the case, more than $2,000 per hour for colleagues, and in excess of $1,000 per hour for administrative work). A Microsoft attorney responded, \"Somebody ends up paying for this. These large fee awards get passed on to consumers.\" The total bill for legal fees was later reduced to just over $112 million. Because of the structure of the settlement, the law firm which sued Microsoft could end up getting more money from the company than California consumers and schools, the beneficiaries of the settlement.\n\nIn 2006, Microsoft initiated an investigation of Lithuanian government institutions for determining whether they choose long-term strategies of the software they use correctly. The investigation, funded by Microsoft itself, will be performed by the Vilnius University together with the Lithuanian Institution of the Free Market, a think tank organization. The investigation was initialised after the government started to prepare 860 thousand litas project to encourage the use of open-source software. The vice-president of Microsoft, Vahe Torossian, stated that \"the government should not be technologically subjectivist\".\n\nMicrosoft was sued for the \"Windows Vista Capable\" logo\nand in Iowa. Microsoft Word was also a subject of court case.\n\nOn July 12, 2013, Microsoft is suing the U.S. Customs and Border Protection over Google phone ban. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano is also named in the lawsuit.\n\nMicrosoft has also fought numerous legal battles against private companies. The most prominent ones are against:\n\n\nThe dispute between Microsoft and Lucent (and later Alcatel-Lucent) began in 2003 when Lucent Technologies (acquired by Alcatel in 2006) filed suit against Gateway in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California in San Diego. Lucent also sued Dell in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia; soon thereafter, that court transferred the Dell case to San Diego, where it was consolidated with the case against Gateway. Lucent claimed in this first San Diego case that Dell and Gateway had violated patents on MP3-related technologies developed by Bell Labs, a division of predecessor company American Telephone & Telegraph. Other patents said to be infringed relate to MPEG video technology, speech technology, internet technology, and other technologies. Microsoft intervened in the lawsuit in April 2003 and Alcatel was added after it acquired Lucent.\n\nAfter the first San Diego lawsuit was filed, Microsoft and Lucent have filed additional patent lawsuits against each other. In February 2007, Microsoft filed a lawsuit at the International Trade Commission claiming that Alcatel-Lucent infringed its patents. There is a second case in San Diego where Microsoft is asserting that Alcatel-Lucent infringes 10 of its patents, and yet another case in Texas where each alleges that the other is infringing its patents.\n\n\n\nSurfCast is suing Microsoft for infringing patent on Live Tiles.\n\n\"Apple Computer Inc. v. Microsoft Corporation\", 35 F.3d 1435 (9th Cir. 1994) was a copyright infringement lawsuit in which Apple Computer, Inc. (now Apple Inc.) sought to prevent Microsoft Corporation and Hewlett-Packard from using visual graphical user interface (GUI) elements that were similar to those in Apple's Lisa and Macintosh operating systems. Some critics claimed that Apple was really attempting to gain all intellectual property rights over the desktop metaphor for computer interfaces, and perhaps all GUIs, on personal computers. Apple lost all claims in the lawsuit, except that the court ruled that the \"trash can\" icon and file folder icons from Hewlett-Packard's now-forgotten NewWave windows application were infringing. The lawsuit was filed in 1988 and lasted four years; the decision was affirmed on appeal in 1994, and Apple's appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was denied.\n\n\"Microsoft v. Lindows.com, Inc.\" was a court case brought on December 20, 2001, by Microsoft against Lindows, Inc, claiming that the name \"Lindows\" was a violation of its trademark \"Windows.\" In addition to the United States, Microsoft has also sued Lindows in Sweden, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Canada. Michael Robertson has called this situation \"Sextuple Jeopardy\", an extension of the term double jeopardy.\n\nIn response to these lawsuits, Lindows had launched \"ChoicePC.com\", which allows people to purchase lifetime Lindows memberships that includes a free copy of LindowsOS, free LindowsOS upgrades for life, and a ChoicePC.com T-shirt, for US$100. All money from the memberships goes towards helping Lindows in its legal battle against Microsoft.\n\nIn a legal dispute, Microsoft sued a Canadian high school student named Mike Rowe over the domain name MikeRoweSoft.com. The case received international press attention following Microsoft's perceived heavy handed approach to a 12th grade student's part-time web design business and the subsequent support that Rowe received from the online community. A settlement was eventually agreed, with Rowe granting ownership of the domain to Microsoft in return for training and gifts.\n\n, the domain MikeRoweSoft.com still redirects to microsoft.com.\n\nMicrosoft sued several parties for \"contributory cybersquatting\"—that is, encouraging others (through software and instructional videos) to cybersquat on domain names that infringed on Microsoft's trademarks. Microsoft prevailed in court and also established a precedent that liabilities under the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA) include contributory trademark infringement.\n\nFrom 1993 until 2002, Total Commander was called \"Windows Commander\"; the name was changed in 2002, out of fear of a lawsuit after the developers received a letter from Microsoft pointing out that the word \"windows\" was trademarked by Microsoft.\n\nThe wxWindows project was renamed to wxWidgets in September 2003 out of fear of a lawsuit after the founder developer Julian Smart received a letter from Microsoft pointing out that the 'Windows' is a UK trademark owned by Microsoft.\n\nThe Microwindows project was renamed to Nano-X Window System in January 2005, due to legal threats from Microsoft regarding the Windows trademark.\n\n\nMicrosoft has been accused of deceiving consumers by concealing the high failure rate of its Xbox 360 game console. A woman from California sued Microsoft on October 2008 in Superior Court in Sacramento County, stating that the company violated multiple state consumer-protection and unfair-competition laws. The woman alleged that the company continued to sell the Xbox 360 even though it knew that the console's hardware was likely to fail.\n\n"}

It received its formal first reading on 26 January 1999. The bill sought to transfer the power to authorise military strikes against Iraq from the monarch to Parliament. The long title of the bill was \"A Bill to require the prior approval, by a simple majority of the House of Commons, of military action by United Kingdom forces against Iraq\". It was presented by Tam Dalyell and supported by Tony Benn, Harry Cohen, Jeremy Corbyn, George Galloway, Neil Gerrard, Dr Ian Gibson, John McAllion, Alice Mahon, Robert Marshall-Andrews, Dennis Skinner and Audrey Wise.\n\nThe bill became Bill 35 in the 1998/1999 Parliamentary session, and was initially scheduled for second reading on 16 April 1999. As a bill modifying the monarch's prerogative powers, Queen's Consent was required before it could be debated in Parliament. The Queen, acting upon the advice of her government, refused to grant her consent for the Bill to be debated. The second reading was initially postponed from 16 April until 23 July 1999. Due to the Crown's continuing refusal to signify its consent to the Bill being debated, it could not receive its second reading on 23 July 1999. In the absence of a request for a further postponement, the Bill was automatically dropped before it obtained its second reading.\n\nWhen military action against Iraq was eventually organised in 2003, the government sought Parliamentary approval on 18 March 2003, one day before the invasion began, although no powers under the royal prerogative were thereby transferred to Parliament.\n\n"}
{"id": "1482155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1482155", "title": "Nationally recognized statistical rating organization", "text": "Nationally recognized statistical rating organization\n\nA nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) is a credit rating agency (CRA) that issues credit ratings that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) permits other financial firms to use for certain regulatory purposes. Originally, seven rating agencies were recognized as NRSROs, a number that dwindled as a result of mergers to six by the mid-1990s and then to three by 2003. As of March 2015, ten organizations were designated as NRSROs.\nRatings by NRSROs are used for a variety of regulatory purposes in the United States. In addition to net capital requirements (described in more detail below), the SEC permits certain bond issuers to use a shorter prospectus form when issuing bonds if the issuer is older, has issued bonds before, and has a credit rating above a certain level. SEC regulations also require that money market funds (mutual funds that mimic the safety and liquidity of a bank savings deposit, but without U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance) comprise only securities with a very high rating from an NRSRO. Likewise, insurance regulators use credit ratings from NRSROs to ascertain the strength of the reserves held by insurance companies.\n\nThe use of the term NRSRO began in 1975 when the SEC promulgated rules regarding bank and broker-dealer net capital requirements (). The idea is that banks and other financial institutions should not need to keep in reserve the same amount of capital to protect the institution (against, for example, a run on the bank) if the financial institution is heavily invested in highly liquid and very \"safe\" securities, such as U.S. government bonds or commercial paper from very stable companies. The safety of these securities, under this approach, is reflected in their credit ratings, as determined by certain highly respected CRAs. In the early 1980s, there were seven NRSROs, but, due to mergers, this number dropped to three during the 1990s. Recently, the SEC, arguably as a result of political pressure and/or concern about concentration in the industry, added to this number, first with DBRS (a Canadian CRA formerly known as Dominion Bond Rating Service) in 2003, and A.M. Best in 2005. In 2007, the SEC added two Japanese rating agencies, Japan Credit Rating Agency and Ratings and Investment Information and a Philadelphia area based firm Egan-Jones Rating Company (EJR).\n\nOriginally, the SEC did not adopt specific standards for determining which credit rating agencies were \"nationally recognized\", and instead addressed the question on a case-by-case basis. NRSRO recognition was granted by the SEC through a \"No Action Letter\" sent by the SEC staff. Under this approach, if a CRA (or investment bank or broker-dealer) were interested in using the ratings from a particular CRA for regulatory purposes, the SEC staff would research the market to determine whether ratings from that particular CRA are widely used and considered \"reliable and credible.\" If the SEC staff determined that this was the case, it would send a letter to the CRA indicating that if a regulated entity were to rely on the CRA's ratings, the SEC staff would not recommend enforcement action against that entity. These \"No Action Letters\" were made public and could be relied upon by other regulated entities, not just the entity making the original request. The SEC later sought to further define the criteria it uses when making this assessment, and in March 2005 published a proposed regulation to this effect. According to the SEC:\n\nIn 2006, following criticism that the SEC's \"No Action letter\" approach was simultaneously too opaque and provided the SEC with too little regulatory oversight of NRSROs, the U.S. Congress passed the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006, . This law required the SEC to establish clear guidelines for determining which credit rating agencies qualify as NRSROs. It also gives the SEC the power to regulate NRSRO internal processes regarding record-keeping and how they guard against conflicts of interest, and makes the NRSRO determination subject to a Commission vote (rather than an SEC staff determination). Notably, however, the law specifically prohibits the SEC from regulating an NRSRO's rating methodologies. In June 2007, the SEC promulgated new regulations that implemented the provisions of the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act. In February 2009, the SEC promulgated amended regulations designed to address concerns about the integrity of the process by which NRSROs rate structured finance products, particularly mortgage-related securities.\n\nSince 2010, there have also been changes in laws and regulations due to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.\n\nMany private users (pension funds, banks) of ratings data now demand that ratings be from an NRSRO. Consequently, there is some debate that, by \"recognizing\" certain CRAs, the SEC has bestowed a competitive advantage on them. This view is supported by the vigor by which many non-NRSRO CRAs seek NRSRO recognition. On the other hand, historically, many private users of ratings data have \"defaulted\" to Standard & Poor's and Moody's when specifying which ratings must be used for their own purposes. (S&P and Moody's are the oldest, most widely respected, and by far the largest of the CRAs.) Accordingly, it is conceivable that the NRSRO designation has actually increased competition in the industry by providing an unintended government \"seal of approval\" on certain smaller CRAs (such as Fitch Ratings, DBRS, Kroll Bond Rating Agency, A.M. Best and Egan-Jones). If true, this, of course, raises the question of whether this is something the government should do, and whether the NRSRO recognition process is the best mechanism to achieve this goal.\n\nThe larger NRSROs have also been criticized for their reliance on an \"issuer-pays\" business model, whereby the bulk of their revenue comes from the issuers of the bonds being rated, so that the company receiving the credit rating pays the CRA directly. While this is recognized by regulators as a potential conflict of interest (since the bond issuer paying for the rating has an incentive to seek out the CRA most likely to give it a high rating, possibly creating a \"race-to-the-bottom\" in terms of rating quality), the larger NRSROs claim that the issuer-pays model is the only feasible model for them, because, in an age of email and faxes, the ratings of the larger CRAs are so widely and so quickly shared that a subscription-based model would not be profitable. Conversely, the predominance of the issuer-pays model has led to concerns that a CRA will be tempted to artificially inflate its rating to retain a valued customer.\nFurthermore, the larger CRAs often receive non-public information from issuers and, under the SEC's Regulation FD, a CRA may only use such information if its ratings are made available to the public for free.\n\nThis threat has been taken seriously by U.S. regulators who have adopted amendments to existing regulations designed to separate the payment negotiation and the credit assessment branches within a firm.\n\nSome smaller CRAs, including Egan-Jones (the only NRSRO to do so), use a subscription-based business model whereby ratings are not made public but are available only to subscribers, who pay a monthly fee for access to credit rating information. These smaller CRAs argue that such a business model makes them less reliant on the good will of the issuers they rate, thereby eliminating one major potential conflict of interest.\n\nThe ratings agencies were heavily involved in the markets that enabled the subprime credit bubble of 2000-2008 and the subsequent financial crisis. In 1984 the federal government of the United States passed the Secondary Mortgage Market Enhancement Act (SMMEA) to improve the marketability of private-label (non-agency) mortgage-backed securities, which declared NRSRO AA-rated mortgage-backed securities to be legal investments equivalent to Treasury securities and other federal government bonds for federally-charted banks (such as federal savings banks, federal savings associations, etc.), state-chartered financial institutions (such as depository banks and insurance companies) unless overridden by state law by October 1991 (of which 21 states did so), and Department of Labor-regulated pension funds.\n\nThe agencies made substantial profits from rating Collateralized debt obligations, residential mortgage-backed securities, and other creatures of structured finance intimately connected to the subprime industry. The ratings on these products were essential to the way the banks marketed the products. Buyers, like pension funds, university endowments, and cities (a classic example being the city of Narvik, Norway), relied on these ratings in their decisions to purchase CDOs and other structured finance products. The activities of the ratings agencies have been detailed in many books, including \"The Big Short\", by Michael Lewis, \"Confidence Game\" by Christine S. Richard, \"All The Devils are Here\" by Bethany McClean and Joe Nocera, and in many other accounts of the financial crisis. Janet Tavakoli, author of \"Structured Finance and Collateralized Debt Obligations\", has suggested that these agencies lose their NRSRO status in relation to certain financial products. In 2011, the US Senate released the Levin-Coburn report on \"Wall Street and the Financial Crisis\"; it did a case study of the behavior of some of the CRAs during the crisis.\n\nAs of December 2016, ten organizations were designated as NRSROs, including the Big Three.\n\n\n\n"}

On 17 December 2013, the pair was sentenced to six years and eight months in prison. They took up coveted positions training in beauty therapy in a bid to become hair stylists in the Ancón 2 prison.\n\nIn early 2016, both women made attempts to return to the United Kingdom. McCollum applied to be freed on parole, and was released on 31 March 2016, with the prospect of having to remain in Peru for up to six years. In April, the Peruvian authorities agreed to expel Reid from the country: she was released from prison on 21 June and immediately returned home to Britain, arriving at Glasgow airport the following day. McCollum returned to Europe two months later, arriving at Dublin airport in the Republic of Ireland on 13 August 2016.\n\nThe women have received extensive press coverage in Peru, the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland and also around the world since their arrest.

Despite the multiple changes of government and legal framework since its enactment, it remained in effect. It does not contain any provisions for natural gas drilling. In the 2000s, the Libyan government began work on drafting a new petroleum law.\n\nThe law established a Petroleum Commission, which made decisions on whether or not to grant concessions. Initial drafts of the law stipulated that provincial governors had the power to appoint members of the commission, and also made final decisions on concessions. However, these powers were eliminated in the final version of the law, in what historian Dirk Vandewalle described as a rare example of the national interest overriding that of the provinces.\n\nUnder the law, a contractor working for the National Oil Corporation is permitted to bring equipment into Libya free of import duties; however, this provision does not apply to contractors working for private oil companies, who are governed by the Administrative Contracts Regulation 2000.

Rowlingson commenced practice as a registered Patent Agent in the former British colony of Victoria. This practice was operated from Melbourne, but encompassed the six original colonies (now Australian States) with their separate legislation for the protection of inventions, trade marks, designs and copyrights. In 1889 Albert Swanston, who had practiced independently as a registered Patent Agent, joined Rowlingson and they remained in partnership as Swanson & Rowlingson until 1892. Edwin Phillips then acquired the practice and renamed the business Phillips, Ormonde & Co.\n\nEdwin Phillips, who had emigrated from England for health reasons, had a broad ranging interest in engineering. He was also a prolific writer on the subject of patent protection and on matters of a technical and scientific nature. Phillips wrote and published a comprehensive handbook for inventors entitled The Inventor’s Aid, and a periodical \"The Scientific Australian\". Upon his arrival in Australia from England in 1881, Edwin Phillips took up employment with the fledgling Australian Electric Light Company. He installed lighting plants at mines on behalf of that company, in Victoria and in the colony of Queensland. In 1885, he entered into the partnership of Phillips & Jacques, an engineering firm operating from Richmond, Victoria. Phillips was a Director of several prominent Victorian companies and these outside Directorships, engineering interests and other investments provided him with ample resources to pursue his interest in intellectual property law and to establish Phillips, Ormonde & Co.\n\nFederation of the Australian colonies had been proposed in the 1850s. However, it was not until after the Intercolonial Convention in December, 1883 that a Bill to establish the Federal Council of Australasia was drafted. The Bill was sufficiently broad-ranging to foreshadow the Council having authority over patents of invention and discovery and copyright. After Federation in 1901, the drafting of legislation to give effect to that authority became necessary. The first Australian Patents Act came into effect in 1903, the Trade Marks Act 1905 and the Designs Act 1906. As a Patent Agent registered under the prior colonial legislation, Edwin Phillips was able to continue his practice following Federation and, in 1904, he was registered as a Patent Attorney under the Patents Act 1903. He continued his practice under the new Federal legislation until 1921, and died in 1923 at the age of 64.\n\nAfter joining Phillips, Ormonde & Co., Cecil Woods LePlastrier was registered as a Patent Attorney in 1905. LePlastrier, one of the first to qualify for registration as a Patent Attorney under the official examination established pursuant to that Act, subsequently joined Phillips in partnership. Victor Kelson joined the firm around 1907 and was registered as a Patent Attorney in 1920. At that stage, Kelson was admitted to partnership and the firm name was changed to Phillips Ormonde LePlastrier & Kelson.\n\nCecil LePlastrier was the Senior Partner of Phillips Ormonde LePlastrier & Kelson until his death in 1952. A flamboyant autocrat, he was a leading figure in business and the profession and served as Consul for the Republic of Chile. Under the guidance of Cecil LePlastrier, the partnership expanded in 1938 to include both Geoffrey Sly, who was Senior Partner from 1952 until his death in 1964 and Bertram C. Fitzpatrick, (originally engaged by Edwin Phillips himself in 1919) who was Senior Partner from 1964 until his retirement in 1972. Under B. C. Fitzpatrick, the firm’s name was changed to Phillips Ormonde & Fitzpatrick in 1967.\n\nOver the past 20 years the firm has expanded rapidly to its present size with more than 25 partners and more than 140 total staff, making it one of the largest intellectual property firms in Australasia.\n\nPOF offers a comprehensive range of intellectual property services including:\n\n"}
{"id": "5168923", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5168923", "title": "Render unto Caesar", "text": "Render unto Caesar\n\n\"Render unto Caesar\" is the beginning of a phrase attributed to Jesus in the synoptic gospels, which reads in full, \"Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's\" ().\n\nThis phrase has become a widely quoted summary of the relationship between Christianity, secular government, and society. The original message, coming in response to a question of whether it was lawful for Jews to pay taxes to Caesar, gives rise to multiple possible interpretations about the circumstances under which it is desirable for the Christian to submit to earthly authority.\n\nAll three synoptic gospels state that hostile questioners tried to trap Jesus into taking an explicit and dangerous stand on whether Jews should or should not pay taxes to the Roman authorities. The accounts in and say that the questioners were Pharisees and Herodians, while says only that they were \"spies\" sent by \"teachers of the law and the chief priests\".\nThey anticipated that Jesus would oppose the tax, as their purpose was \"to hand him over to the power and authority of the governor\". The governor was Pilate, and he was the man responsible for the collecting of taxes in Roman Judea. At first the questioners flattered Jesus by praising his integrity, impartiality, and devotion to truth. Then they asked him whether or not it is right for Jews to pay the taxes demanded by Caesar. In the Gospel of Mark the additional, provocative question is asked, \"Should we pay or shouldn't we?\"\n\nJesus first called them hypocrites, and then asked one of them to produce a Roman coin that would be suitable for paying Caesar's tax. One of them showed him a Roman coin, and he asked them whose head and inscription were on it. They answered, \"Caesar's,\" and he responded: \"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's\".\n\nThe questioners were impressed. states that they \"marveled\" () and being satisfied with the answer, they went away.\n\nThe text identifies the coin as a , and it is usually thought that the coin was a Roman denarius with the head of Tiberius. The coin is also called the \"tribute penny.\" The inscription reads \"Ti[berivs] Caesar Divi Avg[vsti] F[ilivs] Avgvstvs\" (\"Caesar Augustus Tiberius, son of the Divine Augustus\"). The reverse shows a seated female, usually identified as Livia depicted as Pax.\n\nHowever, it has been suggested that denarii were not in common circulation in Judaea during Jesus' lifetime and that the coin may have instead been an Antiochan tetradrachm bearing the head of Tiberius, with Augustus on the reverse. Another suggestion often made is the denarius of Augustus with Caius and Lucius on the reverse, while coins of Julius Caesar, Mark Antony, and Germanicus are all considered possibilities. Whichever Roman coin it was, the fact that Jesus's interrogators had an idolatrous coin with its \"graven image\" of whomever, and in the Temple precincts no less, immediately convicted them of blasphemy and put Jesus at a rhetorical advantage.\n\nA similar episode occurs in the Gospel of Thomas (verse 100), but there the coin in question is gold.\n\nThe taxes imposed on Judaea by Rome had led to riots. New Testament scholar Willard Swartley writes:\nThe tax denoted in the text was a specific tax… It was a poll tax, a tax instituted in A.D. 6. A census taken at that time (cf. Lk. 2:2) to determine the resources of the Jews provoked the wrath of the country. Judas of Galilee led a revolt (Acts 5:37), which was suppressed only with some difficulty. Many scholars date the origin of the Zealot party and movement to this incident.\n\nThe Jewish Encyclopedia says of the Zealots:\nWhen, in the year 5, Judas of Gamala in Galilee started his organized opposition to Rome, he was joined by one of the leaders of the Pharisees, R. Zadok, a disciple of Shammai and one of the fiery patriots and popular heroes who lived to witness the tragic end of Jerusalem… The taking of the census by Quirinus, the Roman procurator, for the purpose of taxation was regarded as a sign of Roman enslavement; and the Zealots' call for stubborn resistance to the oppressor was responded to enthusiastically.\n\nAt his trial before Pontius Pilate, Jesus was accused of promoting resistance to Caesar's tax.\nThen the whole company of them arose and brought him before Pilate. 2 And they began to accuse him, saying, \"We found this man misleading our nation and forbidding us to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king.\" ()\n\nThe passage has been much discussed in the modern context of Christianity and politics, especially \non the questions of separation of church and state and tax resistance.\n\nWhen Jesus later allowed himself to be crucified, although he was divine, he was in a sense rendering unto Caesar the body that belonged to Caesar's (human, earthly) realm, while devoting his soul to God. Augustine of Hippo suggested this interpretation in his Confessions, where he writes\nHe himself, the only-begotten, was created to be wisdom and justice and holiness for us, and he was counted among us, and he paid the reckoning, the tribute to Caesar.\n\nJesus responds to Pontius Pilate about the nature of his kingdom: \"My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have been fighting, that I might not be delivered over to the Jews. But now (or 'as it is') my kingdom is not from the world\" (John 18:36); i.e., his religious teachings were separate from earthly political activity. This reflects a traditional division in Christian thought by which state and church have separate spheres of influence. This can be interpreted either a Catholic, or Thomist, way (Gelasian doctrine) or a Protestant, or Lockean, way (separation of church and state).\nTertullian, in \"De Idololatria\", interprets Jesus as saying to render \"the image of Caesar, which is on the coin, to Caesar, and the image of God, which is on man, to God; so as to render to Caesar indeed money, to God yourself. Otherwise, what will be God's, if all things are Caesar's?\"\n\nH. B. Clark writes, \"It is a doctrine of both Mosaic and Christian law that governments are divinely ordained and derive their powers from God. In the Old Testament it is asserted that \"Power belongs unto God,\" (Ps 62:11) that God \"removes kings and sets up kings,\" (Dan 2:21) and that \"The Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever He will\" (Dan 4:32). Similarly, in the New Testament, it is stated that \"...there is no power but of God, the powers that be are ordained of God\" (Rom 13:1).\n\nR. J. Rushdoony expands, \"In early America, there was no question, whatever the form of civil government, that all legitimate authority is derived from God... Under a biblical doctrine of authority, because \"the powers that be are ordained of God (Rom 13:1), all authority, whether in the home, school, state, church, or any other sphere, is subordinate authority and is under God and subject to His word.\" This means, first, that all obedience is subject to the prior obedience to God and his Word, for \"We ought to obey God rather than men\" (Acts 5:29; 4:19). Although civil obedience is commanded, it is equally apparent that the prior requirement of obedience to God must prevail.\"\n\nSome read the phrase \"Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's\" as unambiguous at least to the extent that it commands people to respect state authority and to pay the taxes it demands of them. Paul the Apostle also states in Romans 13 that Christians are obliged to obey all earthly authorities, stating that as they were introduced by God, disobedience to them equates to disobedience to God.\n\nIn this interpretation, Jesus asked his interrogators to produce a coin in order to demonstrate to them that by using his coinage they had already admitted the \"de facto\" rule of the emperor, and that therefore they should submit to that rule.\n\nFor example, one Mennonite explained why he was not a war tax resister this way:\n\nWe are against war and do not wish to aid the war effort by conscription or by paying war taxes to the government. Doing so only helps to strengthen and perpetuate the war machine. Matthew 22:21 Jesus said \"Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and to God the things that are God's.\" Romans 13:1 \"Let every person be in subjection to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God and those which exist are established by God.\" If the law of the land is that everyone must pay war taxes then that is what we must do. It is the law! We should however, work and pray extremely hard to change the law. The ideal situation would be to have the law abolished. The alternative would be to have a choice of designating our portion of the war tax towards efforts of peacemaking. This route would be a more lawful, constructive, and positive effort.\n\nSome see the parable as being Jesus' message to people that if they enjoy the advantages of a state such as Caesar's, as distinct from God's authority (for instance, by using its legal tender), they can't subsequently choose to ignore the laws of such a state. Henry David Thoreau writes in \"Civil Disobedience\":\n\nChrist answered the Herodians according to their condition. \"Show me the tribute-money,\" said he; – and one took a penny out of his pocket; – If you use money which has the image of Caesar on it, and which he has made current and valuable, that is, if you are men of the State, and gladly enjoy the advantages of Caesar's government, then pay him back some of his own when he demands it; \"Render therefore to Caesar that which is Caesar's and to God those things which are God's\" – leaving them no wiser than before as to which was which; for they did not wish to know.\n\nMennonite Dale Glass-Hess wrote:\n\nIt is inconceivable to me that Jesus would teach that some spheres of human activity lie outside the authority of God. Are we to heed Caesar when he says to go to war or support war-making when Jesus says in other places that we shall not kill? No! My perception of this incident is that Jesus does not answer the question about the morality of paying taxes to Caesar, but that he throws it back on the people to decide. When the Jews produce a denarius at Jesus' request, they demonstrate that they are already doing business with Caesar on Caesar's terms. I read Jesus' statement, \"Give to Caesar…\" as meaning \"Have you incurred a debt in regard to Caesar! Then you better pay it off.\" The Jews had already compromised themselves. Likewise for us: we may refuse to serve Caesar as soldiers and even try to resist paying for Caesar's army. But the fact is that by our lifestyles we've run up a debt with Caesar, who has felt constrained to defend the interests that support our lifestyles. Now he wants paid back, and it's a little late to say that we don't owe anything. We've already compromised ourselves. If we're going to play Caesar's games, then we should expect to have to pay for the pleasure of their enjoyment. But if we are determined to avoid those games, then we should be able to avoid paying for them.\n\nMohandas K. Gandhi shared this perspective. He wrote:\n\nJesus evaded the direct question put to him because it was a trap. He was in no way bound to answer it. He therefore asked to see the coin for taxes. And then said with withering scorn, \"How can you who traffic in Caesar's coins and thus receive what to you are benefits of Caesar's rule refuse to pay taxes?\" Jesus' whole preaching and practice point unmistakably to noncooperation, which necessarily includes nonpayment of taxes.\n\nMennonite pastor John K. Stoner spoke for those who interpret the parable as permitting or even encouraging tax resistance: \"We are war tax resisters because we have discovered some doubt as to what belongs to Caesar and what belongs to God, and have decided to give the benefit of the doubt to God.\"\n\nAs American Quaker war tax resistance developed during the 17th through 19th centuries, the resisters had to find a way to reconcile their tax resistance with the \"Render unto Caesar\" verse and other verses from the New Testament that encourage submission to the government. Here are a few examples:\n\nAround 1715, a pseudonymous author, \"Philalethes,\" published a pamphlet entitled \"Tribute to Cæsar, How paid by the Best Christians...\" in which he argued that while Christians must pay \"general\" taxes, a tax that is explicitly for war purposes is the equivalent to an offering on an altar to a pagan god, and this is forbidden.\n\nIn 1761, Joshua Evans put it this way:\n\nOthers would term it stubbornness in me, or contrary to the doctrine of Christ, concerning rendering to Caesar his due. But as I endeavored to keep my mind in a state of humble quietude, I was favored to see through such groundless arguments; there being nothing on the subject of war, or favorable to it, to be found in that text. Although I have been willing to pay my money for the use of civil government, when legally called for; yet have I felt restrained by a conscientious motive, from paying towards the expense of killing men, women and children, or laying towns and countries waste.\n\nIn 1780, Samuel Allinson circulated a letter on the subject of tax resistance, in which he insisted that what was due to Caesar was only what Caesar would not use for antichristian purposes:\n\n…the question put to our Savior on the point was with evil intention to ensnare and render him culpable to one of the great parties or sects then existing, who differed about the payment of taxes, his answer, though conclusive, was so wisely framed that it left them still in doubt, what things belonged to Cæsar and what to God, thus he avoided giving either of them offence which he must inevitably have done by a determination that tribute indefinitely was due to Cæsar. Our first and principle obedience is due to the Almighty, even in contradiction to man, \"We ought to obey God rather than men\" (Acts 5:29). Hence, if tribute is demanded for a use that is antichristian, it seems right for every Christian to deny it, for Cæsar can have no title to that which opposes the Lord's command.\n\nIn 1862, Joshua Maule wrote that he felt that the \"Render unto Caesar\" instruction was compatible with war tax resistance, as there was no reason to believe for certain that the tax referred to in that episode had any connection to war:\n\nThe words of Christ, \"Render to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's, and to God the things that are God's,\" have often been brought forward as evidence that He approved of paying all taxes; it being said, in connection, that Cæsar was then engaged in war. The distinction, however, is sufficiently clear: the things that were Cæsar's were, doubtless, those which appertain to the civil government; the things which belong to God are, surely, a clear and full obedience to His commands and to His laws. We know that all the precepts and commands of Christ which can be applied in reference to this subject are of one tendency, enjoining \"peace on earth and good-will to men.\" We do not know, after all, however, what was the exact nature and use of the tribute collected in those days, nor what were the situation and circumstances in which Christians or others were then placed in regard to such things.\n\nChristian anarchists do not interpret Matthew 22:21 as advocating support for taxes but as further advice to free oneself from material attachment. Jacques Ellul believes the passage shows that Caesar may have rights over the fiat money he produces, but not things that are made by God, as he explains:\n\nAmmon Hennacy interpreted Matthew 22:21 slightly differently. He was on trial for civil disobedience and was asked by the judge to reconcile his tax resistance with Jesus' instructions. \"I told him Caesar was getting too much around here and some one had to stand up for God.\" Elsewhere, he interpreted the story in this way:\n\nThe extracanonical Gospel of Thomas also has a version, which reads in the Stephen Patterson and Marvin Meyer Version 100:\n\nThey showed Jesus a gold coin and said to him, \"The Roman emperor's people demand taxes from us.\" He said to them, \"Give the emperor what belongs to the emperor, give God what belongs to God, and give me what is mine.\"\n\nThe fragmentary Egerton Gospel in the Scholar's Version translation (found in \"The Complete Gospels\") 3:1–6 reads:\n\nThey come to him and interrogate him as a way of putting him to the test. They ask, \"Teacher, Jesus, we know that you are [from God], since the things you do put you above all the prophets. Tell us, then, is it permissible to pay to rulers what is due them? Should we pay them or not?\" Jesus knew what they were up to, and became indignant. Then he said to them, \"Why do you pay me lip service as a teacher, but not [do] what I say? How accurately Isaiah prophesied about you when he said, 'This people honors me with their lips, but their heart stays far away from me; their worship of me is empty, [because they insist on teachings that are human] commandments […]'\n\n\n"}

The monarch is regarded internally as the absolute authority, or \"sole prerogative,\" and prerogative the source of many of the executive powers of the British government.\n\nPrerogative powers were formerly exercised by the monarch acting on his or her own initiative. Since the 19th century, by convention, the advice of the prime minister or the cabinet—who are then accountable to Parliament for the decision—has been required in order for the prerogative to be exercised. The monarch remains constitutionally empowered to exercise the royal prerogative against the advice of the prime minister or the cabinet, but in practice would only do so in emergencies or where existing precedent does not adequately apply to the circumstances in question.\n\nToday the royal prerogative is available in the conduct of the government of the United Kingdom, including foreign affairs, defence, and national security. The monarchy has a significant constitutional presence in these and other matters, but limited power, because the exercise of the prerogative is in the hands of the prime minister and other ministers or other government officials.\n\nThe royal prerogative has been called \"a notoriously difficult concept to define adequately\", but whether a particular type of prerogative power exists is a matter of common law to be decided by the courts as the final arbiter. A prominent constitutional theorist, A. V. Dicey, proposed in the nineteenth century that:\n\nWhile many commentators follow the Diceyan view, there are constitutional lawyers who prefer the definition given by William Blackstone in the 1760s:\nDicey's opinion that any action of governance by the monarch beyond statute is under the prerogative diverges from Blackstone's that the prerogative simply covers those actions that no other person or body in the United Kingdom can undertake, such as declaration of war. Case law exists to support both views. Blackstone's notion of the prerogative being the powers of an exclusive nature was favoured by Lord Parmoor in the De Keyser's Royal Hotel case of 1920, but some difficulty with it was expressed by Lord Reid in the Burmah Oil case of 1965. A clear distinction has not been necessary in the relevant cases, and the courts may never need to settle the question as few cases deal directly with the prerogative itself.\n\nThe royal prerogative originated as the personal power of the monarch. From the 13th century in England, as in France, the monarch was all-powerful, but this absolute power was checked by \"the recrudescence of feudal turbulence in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries\". An early attempt to define the royal prerogative was stated by Richard II's judges in 1387.\n\nDuring the 16th century, this \"turbulence\" began to recede, and the monarch became truly independent. Under Henry VIII and his successors, the king was the head of the Protestant English church, and therefore not answerable to the clergy. The rise of Parliament in this period, however, was problematic. While the monarch was \"the predominant partner in the English constitution\", the courts stopped short of declaring him all-powerful, recognising the role that Parliament played. In \"Ferrer's Case\", Henry recognised this, noting that he was far more powerful with the consent of Parliament than without. Nowhere was this more apparent than in the matter of taxation: Sir Thomas Smith and other writers of the period pointed out the monarch could not impose taxation without Parliament's consent.\n\nAt the same time, Henry and his descendants normally followed the will of the courts, despite the fact they were theoretically not bound by judges. William Holdsworth infers that by regularly asking the legal officers of the crown and judiciary for legal advice and consent, Henry recognised the need for a stable government to follow the law. He also contends that the view that the law is supreme over all \"was the view of all the leading lawyers and statesmen and publicists of the Tudor period\". It was accepted that while the King had \"unfettered discretion\", he was limited in areas where the courts had imposed conditions on the use of the prerogative, or where he had chosen to do so.\n\nThe first dent in this stability came about in 1607, with the \"Case of Prohibitions\". James VI and I claimed that as monarch, he had a divine right to sit as a judge and interpret the common law as he saw fit. Led by Sir Edward Coke, the judiciary rejected this idea, stating that while the monarch was not subject to any individual, he was subject to the law. Until he had gained sufficient knowledge of the law, he had no right to interpret it; Coke pointed out that such knowledge \"demanded mastery of an artificial reason ... which requires long study and experience, before that a man can attain to the cognizance of it\". Similarly, in the \"Case of Proclamations\" in 1611, Coke held that the monarch could only exercise those prerogatives he already had, and not create new ones.\n\nWith the Glorious Revolution, King James VII and II was replaced by Queen Mary II and her husband King William III. At the same time the Bill of Rights 1689 was drafted, which cemented the monarch's subservience to Parliament. It specifically limited the royal prerogative, with Article 1 holding that the \"power of suspending the laws or the execution of laws by regal authority without consent of Parliament is illegal\", and article 4 confirming that \"levying money for or to the use of the Crown by pretence of prerogative, without grant of Parliament, for longer time, or in other manner than the same is or shall be granted, is illegal\". The Bill also confirmed that Parliament had the right to limit the use of remaining prerogatives, as evidenced by the Triennial Act 1694, which required the monarch to dismiss and call Parliament at certain times.\n\nOne of the monarch's historic prerogatives was the dissolution of Parliament, which was \"perhaps the most important residual prerogative exercised personally by the sovereign, and represents the greatest potential for controversy.\" This prerogative was normally exercised at the request of Parliament and the prime minister, either at his or her discretion or following a motion of no confidence. Constitutional theorists have had differing views as to whether a unilateral dissolution of Parliament would be possible today; Sir Ivor Jennings wrote that a dissolution involves \"the acquiescence of ministers\", and as such the monarch could not dissolve Parliament without ministerial consent; \"if ministers refuse to give such advice, she can do no more than dismiss them\". A. V. Dicey, however, believed that in certain extreme circumstances the monarch could dissolve Parliament single-handedly, on the condition that \"an occasion has arisen on which there is fair reason to suppose that the opinion of the House is not the opinion of the electors... A dissolution is allowable, or necessary, whenever the wishes of the legislature are, or may fairly be presumed to be, different from the wishes of the nation.\"\n\nThe monarch could force the dissolution of Parliament through a refusal of royal assent; this would inevitably lead to a government resigning. By convention, the monarch always assents to bills; the last time the royal assent was not given was in 1708 during the reign of Queen Anne when she withheld royal assent from the Scottish Militia Bill. This does not mean that the right to refuse has died: George V believed he could veto the Third Irish Home Rule Bill; Jennings writes that \"it was assumed by the King throughout that he had not only the legal power but the constitutional right to refuse assent\". The royal prerogative to dissolve Parliament was abrogated by the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011. Section 6(1) of the Act however specifically states that the monarch's power to prorogue Parliament is not affected by the Act.\n\nThe appointment of the prime minister is also, theoretically, governed by the royal prerogative. Technically the monarch may appoint as prime minister anyone she wants to appoint, but in practice the appointee is always the person who commands a majority in the House of Commons. Usually, this is the leader of the political party that is returned to Parliament with a majority of seats after a general election. Difficulties may result with a so-called hung parliament, in which no party commands majority support, as last occurred in 2017. In this situation, constitutional convention is that the previous incumbent has the first right to form a coalition government and seek appointment. If the prime minister decides to retire in the middle of a parliamentary session, as Anthony Eden did in 1957, the monarch has no discretion. There is usually a \"prime minister-in-waiting\" who commands the support of the majority of the Commons; he or she will near-automatically be appointed.\n\nThe most noted prerogative power that affects the judicial system is the prerogative of mercy, which has two elements: the granting of pardons and the granting of \"nolle prosequi\". Pardons may eliminate the \"pains, penalties and punishments\" from a criminal conviction, though they do not remove convictions themselves. This power is commonly exercised on the advice of the Secretary of State for the Home Department; the monarch has no direct involvement in its use. Exercises of this power may also take the form of commutations, a limited form of pardon where the sentences is reduced, on certain conditions. The granting of a pardon is not subject to judicial review, as confirmed by \"Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service\", but the courts have chosen to criticise its application or lack thereof, as in \"R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Bentley\". Granting \"nolle prosequi\" is done by the Attorney General of England and Wales (or the equivalent in Scotland or Northern Ireland) in the name of the crown, to stop legal proceedings against an individual. This is not reviewable by the courts, as confirmed by \"R v Comptroller of Patents\", and does not count as an acquittal; the defendant may be brought before the courts on the same charge at a later date.\n\nThe royal prerogative is in much use in the realm of foreign affairs. It is the monarch who recognises foreign states (although several statutes regulate the immunities enjoyed by their heads and diplomatic representatives), issues declarations of war and peace, and forms international treaties. The monarch also has the power to annex territory, as was done in 1955 with the island of Rockall. Once territory has been annexed, the monarch has complete discretion as to the extent to which the government will take over the former government's liabilities; this was confirmed in \"West Rand Central Gold Mining Company v The King\". The monarch also has the power to alter British territorial waters and cede territory. Her freedom to do these things in practice is doubtful, in that they might deprive British citizens of their nationality and rights. When the island of Heligoland was ceded to Germany in 1890, Parliamentary approval was first sought. The monarch can also regulate colonies and dependent territories by exercising the prerogative through Orders in Council. The courts have long fought against the monarch's use of this power: in \"R (Bancoult) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (No 2)\", the Court of Appeal ruled that using Orders-in-Council to frustrate judicial rulings was an unlawful abuse of power, although this ruling was later overturned.\n\nA judgment delivered in the Court of Appeal in 1988 (\"ex parte Everett\"), and re-stated in a ruling of the High Court delivered in July 2016, confirmed that granting or withdrawing British passports has always been an exercise of the Royal Prerogative, and continues to be exercisable in the Secretary of State's discretion.\n\nUnder the common law, citizens have the right freely to leave and enter the United Kingdom. In \"R v Foreign Secretary ex parte Everett\", the courts held that it was their right to review the granting of passports to, and the withholding of passports from, British citizens. The writ of \"ne exeat regno\" is also used to prevent a person leaving the country. The right to make treaties is a disputed prerogative power: under Blackstone's definition, a prerogative power must be one unique to the monarch.\n\nThe monarch also has power to exercise her prerogative over the granting of honours, the regulation of the armed forces and ecclesiastical appointments. Although the granting of most honours is normally decided by the executive, the monarch is still the person who technically awards them. Exceptions to this rule are membership of the Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle, the Order of Merit, the Royal Victorian Order and the Royal Victorian Chain, which the monarch has complete discretion to grant. In relation to the armed forces, the monarch is the Commander in Chief, and members are regulated under the royal prerogative. Most statutes do not apply to the armed forces, although some areas, such as military discipline, are governed by Acts of Parliament. Under the Crown Proceedings Act 1947, the monarch is the sole authority for the armed forces, and as such their organisation, disposition and control cannot be questioned by the courts. This exercise of prerogative power gives the Crown authority to recruit members of the armed forces, appoint commissioned officers, and establish agreements with foreign governments to station troops in their territory. The prerogative empowers the monarch to appoint bishops and archbishops in the Church of England, and to regulate the printing and licensing of the authorised Church of England version of the Bible. The monarch also exerts a certain influence power on His or Her weekly and closed conversations with the Prime-Minister of the United Kingdom.\n\n\"R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Northumbria Police Authority\", recognised that the prerogative also includes the power to \"take all reasonable steps to preserve the Queen's peace\", and in \"Burmah Oil Co. v Lord Advocate\", the House of Lords took the view that it extended to \"doing all those things in an emergency which are necessary for the conduct of [the Second World War].\"\n\nToday, the monarch exercises the prerogative almost exclusively in line with the advice of her government. Leyland notes that:\n\nIn simple terms, the prerogative is used to govern the realm in the name of the Crown; although the monarch has the \"right to be consulted, the right to encourage, and the right to warn\", her role involves no exercise of discretion.\n\nToday, some prerogative powers are directly exercised by ministers without the approval of Parliament, including the powers of declaring war and of making peace, the issue of passports, and the granting of honours. Prerogative powers are exercised nominally by the monarch, but on the advice of the prime minister (whom the monarch meets weekly) and of the cabinet. Some key functions of the British government are still executed by virtue of the royal prerogative, but generally the usage of the prerogative has been diminishing as functions are progressively put on a statutory basis.\n\nSeveral influential decisions of the House of Lords have determined the limited scope for the use of prerogative powers. In 1915, an appeal was made to the House of Lords, \"Re Petition of Right\" (\"Shoreham Aerodrome Case\"), but during the appeal the case was settled and the appeal withdrawn when the Crown agreed to pay compensation. The appeal was from a unanimous decision of the Court of Appeal that the Crown, both under the statutory Defence of the Realm Regulations and by the royal prerogative, was entitled to take and occupy, for military purposes in wartime, a commercial airfield on the south coast. The government argued that this action was to defend against an invasion; the courts held that for the prerogative to be exercised, the government must demonstrate that a threat of invasion exists. This was backed up by \"The Zamora\" (1916), where the Privy Council, on appeal from the Prize Court, held generally that to exercise a power not granted by statute (such as a prerogative power) the government must prove to the court that the exercise is justified. The next decision came in \"Attorney General v De Keyser's Royal Hotel Ltd\" (1920), where the House of Lords confirmed that a statutory provision in an area where prerogative powers are in use \"abridges the Royal Prerogative while it is in force to this extent – that the Crown can only do the particular thing under and in accordance with the statutory provisions, and that its prerogative power to do that thing is in abeyance\".\n\nThis principle of statutory superiority was extended in \"Laker Airway Ltd v Department of Trade\", concerning the revocation of a commercial airline operator's licence (December 1976), where it was confirmed that prerogative powers could not be used to contradict a statutory provision, and that in situations to which the power and the statute both applied, the power could only be used to further the aim of the statute. Another extension came with \"R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Fire Brigades Union\", where the Court of Appeal held that even if a statute had not yet come into force, the prerogative could not be used to alter this statute to \"conflict with Parliament's wishes\".\n\nWhilst the royal prerogative is deployed by the UK government when making (and unmaking) treaties, the Supreme Court held in \"R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union\" that the government could not use the prerogative to serve notice of termination of the UK's membership of the EU (under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union). Instead legislative authority via an Act of Parliament was required by the Government. The Court's reasoning was that such a notice would inevitably affect rights under domestic law (many EU rights having direct effect in the UK). On the assumption that triggering Article 50 would inevitably result in Brexit, using the prerogative in this way would therefore frustrate the intention of parliament to confer those rights. Following this decision, Parliament decided to provide legal authorisation to the Government to serve a notice in accordance with Article 50. This was duly granted in the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017 and Theresa May exercised the power on 29 March 2017.\n\nBefore the modern judicial review procedure superseded the petition of right as the remedy for challenging the validity of a prerogative power, the courts were traditionally only willing to state whether or not powers existed, not whether they had been used appropriately. They therefore applied only the first of the Wednesbury tests: whether the use was illegal. Constitutional scholars such as William Blackstone consider this appropriate:\n\nDuring the 1960s and 70s this attitude was changing, with Lord Denning saying in the \"Laker Airway\" case that \"seeing that the prerogative is a discretionary power to be exercised for the public good, it follows that its exercise can be examined by the courts just as any other discretionary power which is vested in the executive.\" The most authoritative case on the matter is \"Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service\", generally known as the GCHQ case. The House of Lords confirmed that the application of judicial review would be dependent on the nature of the government's powers, not their source. Foreign policy and national security powers are considered outside the scope of judicial review, while the prerogative of mercy is considered within it, as per \"R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Bentley\".\n\nAbolition of the royal prerogative is not on the immediate horizon, and recent movements to abolish the role of the monarchy and its royal prerogative in government have been unsuccessful. The Ministry of Justice undertook a \"review of executive Royal Prerogative powers\" in October 2009. Former Labour MP and cabinet minister Tony Benn campaigned unsuccessfully for the abolition of the royal prerogative in the United Kingdom in the 1990s, arguing that all governmental powers in effect exercised on the advice of the prime minister and cabinet should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and require parliamentary approval. Later governments argued that such is the breadth of topics covered by the royal prerogative that requiring parliamentary approval in each instance where the prerogative is currently used would overwhelm parliamentary time and slow the enactment of legislation.\n\n\n\n"}

In general, these are the major payment clearing systems or real-time gross settlement systems of individual countries, but in the case of Europe, there are certain pan-European payment systems. TARGET2 is a pan-European SIPS dealing with major inter-bank payments. STEP2, operated by the Euro Banking Association is a major pan-European clearing system for retail payments which has the potential to become a SIPS.\n\nIn the event of a bank failure, adherence to the rules for the operation of SIPS should prevent a domino effect whereby payment obligations of the failing bank are effected against the solvent banks. Clearly, this does not prevent the effects of a bank failure from spreading; however, it closes off one route.\n\nIn 2001, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) issued the \"Core Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems\", and these are summarised below. In certain banking circles, these have become known as the 10 Commandments.\n\nIn 2003 the European Central Bank (ECB) further elaborated on how the principles should be applied in Euro retail payment systems.\n\nSubsequently, in response to the perceived increased risks of terrorist attacks, the ECB in 2006 published detailed oversight expectations for business continuity planning, greatly expanding on core principle number 7.\n\nBIS added an additional recommendation in relation to countries which use cheques. It urged the operators of cheque clearing to have special regard to the fact that cheques may be dishonoured and returned some days after presentation, and this poses special risks. This is particularly relevant to countries such as Britain, Ireland, France, and US and should be regarded as the 11th commandment of payments.\n\nBIS CPSS is currently preparing for the new global standards for not only payment systems but also securities settlement systems, central counterparties and trade repositories.

It was published by Oxford University Press in 2012. The book grew out of contributions by the authors to a conference in April 2011 at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. \"Targeted Killings\" features eighteen essays in five sections arranged by topic. The work argues that after the 11 September attacks by Al-Qaeda in 2001, the United States and other countries began to see the tactic of targeted killing differently. The practice of targeted killing had previously been accepted in situations of self-defence in military settings; after 11 September 2001 it was used to kill non-combatants and those not directly involved in a particular armed force.\n\nThe book begins with a discussion of targeted killing of non-combatants, followed by discussions of legalities, the rationale of self-defence, the choice of targets, and when and whether the ends can be used to justify the means. Several contributors defend targeting of non-combatants, while Jeremy Waldron discusses the morality associated with the tactic and argues against its use. Jeff McMahan identifies the problematic nature of targeted killing and emphasizes regulations for law enforcement to avoid abuse of process. Richard V. Meyer writes that any entity wishing to carry out targeted killing should first have to declare war on the targeted parties. Kevin H. Govern examines the elimination of Osama Bin Laden and identifies this killing as justified and the product of a rational decision-making process. In the final portion of the book, Fernando Tesón says that targeted killing is particularly justified against terrorists because they use tactics specifically designed to kill civilians.\n\nThe book was well received in law reviews and by academics across multiple disciplines. Robin Geiß and Steven J. Barela praised its coverage of the legal, moral, political, and strategic aspects of targeted killings. Steven R. Ratner welcomed its addition to the academic literature, and Madeline E. Cohen wrote that it would be a useful reference for additional research. Abraham David Sofaer praised its treatment of the subject and tables, though he argued the book could have given more weight to the law enforcement model of the use of deadly force against individuals.\n\n\"Targeted Killings: Law and Morality in an Asymmetrical World\" developed as an outgrowth from a conference in April 2011 that focused on philosophy and law. The conference took place at the Institute for Law and Philosophy of the University of Pennsylvania. Experts in the fields of public policy, politics, military regulations, battlefield knowledge, law, ethics, and philosophy discussed contemporaneous issues surrounding targeted killing in society. The conference was titled \"Using Targeted Killing to Fight the War on Terror: Philosophical, Moral, and Legal Challenges\" and was organized by the University of Pennsylvania Law School.\n\nAt the time of the book's initial print publication date, its editor Andrew Altman worked as Professor of Philosophy at Georgia State University and concurrently as Director of Research at the Jean Beer Blumenfeld Center for Ethics. Claire Finkelstein was the Algernon Biddle Professor of Law and Professor of Philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania and concurrently as co-director of the University of Pennsylvania Institute of Law and Philosophy. Jens David Ohlin was employed as an Associate Professor of Law at Cornell Law School. Ohlin's work had been published in academic journals, including the \"American Journal of International Law\", the \"Columbia Law Review\", and the \"Harvard International Law Journal\". He wrote the 2008 book \"Defending Humanity: When Force is Justified and Why\" with George Fletcher, which was also published by Oxford University Press.\n\n\"Targeted Killings: Law and Morality in an Asymmetrical World\" was published in hardcover format by Oxford University Press on 30 April 2012. A paperback version was published at the same time. It was also published as an e-book for the Amazon Kindle by Amazon.com on 1 March 2012. In September 2012, the work was published at \"Oxford Scholarship Online\".\n\n\"Targeted Killings: Law and Morality in an Asymmetrical World\" begins with an introduction by Andrew Altman. This is followed by eighteen essays broken into five sections arranged by topic. The work says that after the Al-Qaeda attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001, the US and other countries began to see the tactic of targeted killing differently. The practice of targeted killing had previously been accepted in situations of self-defense in military settings; after the attacks it was used to kill non-combatants and those not directly involved in a particular armed force.\n\nThe first section of the book is a discussion of targeted killing of non-combatants. In an essay titled \"Rebutting the Civilian Presumption: Playing Whack-a-Mole Without a Mallet?\", Colonel Mark Maxwell criticizes the opposition of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to targeted killing. Maxwell writes that individuals may indeed serve a combat task without being a member of a particular state force. He argues for an extension of the definition of combatant to include those who arm themselves and engage in combat roles. \"Targeting Co-Belligerents\" by professor Jens David Ohlin supports Maxwell's opinion and describes an analytical viewpoint called \"linkage\" in which he states armed terrorists and members of organizations can be killed. Ohlin interprets the guidelines of the ICRC to include reliance upon a military system of identification of combatants. \"Can Just War Theory Justify Targeted Killing\" by professor Daniel Statman is an analysis of three thought processes used to discuss targeted killing rules: \"contractualist\", \"collectivist\", and \"individualist\". Statman writes that the tactic of targeted killing is a just form of combat in each of these analyses. New York University and Oxford University professor Jeremy Waldron deconstructs the morality associated with the tactic and argues against its use. He says that similar rationalizations could be used by the enemy against those conducting the targeted killings, there may be an inherent selection bias of targets, and warns of a slippery slope when defending an actor that uses the methodology.\n\nIn the second portion of the book, a group of articles discuss which sets of laws should be used to regulate targeted killing. Philosophy professor Jeff McMahan of Rutgers University asks, \"Targeted Killing: Murder, Combat or Law Enforcement?\". He says that eliminating enemies for purposes of self-defense is justified. McMahan writes about the problematic nature of targeted killing and emphasizes regulations for law enforcement to avoid abuses of process. University of Pennsylvania law and philosophy professor Claire Finkelstein writes in \"Targeted Killing as Preemptive Action\" about the difficulties of rationalizing targeted killing outside of the realm of typical combat between state actors. Finkelstein characterizes people as noncombatants unless they are a member of a group that includes identification through standardized attire and criminal behaviour patterns. Mississippi College School of Law professor Richard V. Meyer writes that current regulations and standards for targeted killing are inadequate. He says that any entity wishing to carry out targeted killing should first have to declare war on the targeted parties involved.\n\nThe book's third group of essays analyzes the rationale of self-defence as a justification for targeted killing. Washburn University School of Law professor Craig Martin writes in \"Going Medieval: Targeted Killing, Self-Defense and the Jus ad Bellum Regime\" that self-defence is not an appropriate rationale for targeted killing because such a justification is restricted to conflicts between state actors. University of Tulsa School of Law professor Russell Christopher writes in \"Imminence in Justified Targeted Killing\" that self-defence should be ruled out as a suitable position in several examples of potential conflict. He critiques arguments by governments including the United Kingdom and the United States that self-defense can be used as a rationalization of action against imminent danger. Western Washington University emeritus philosophy professor Phillip Montague says in an essay titled \"Defending Defensive Targeted Killings\" that use of this tactic against combatants can be seen as defensible and justified acts against terrorism or those who assist terrorist organizations.\n\nThe fourth portion of the book discusses how to make specific choices in targeted killing situations prior to state actors carrying out actions against individuals. University of Utah S.J. Quinney College of Law professor Amos N. Guiora discusses \"The Importance of Criteria-Based Reasoning in Targeted Killing Decisions\" and concludes that instead of combatant commanders in the field, lawyers in consultation with decision algorithms must make decisions on targets. Pepperdine University School of Law professor Gregory S. McNeal critiques the arguments of those against targeted killing in his essay, \"Are Targeted Killings Unlawful? A Case Study in Empirical Claims Without Empirical Evidence\". He differentiates between decision-making processes of the United States military and those of the Central Intelligence Agency, emphasizing the U.S. military tactic of attempting to avoid collateral damage. Ave Maria School of Law associate professor Kevin H. Govern examines the killing of Osama Bin Laden in his piece \"Operation Neptune Spear: Was Killing Bin Laden a Legitimate Military Objective?\". He says this particular killing was justified and borne out of a rational decision-making process. American University Washington College of Law professor Kenneth Anderson distinguishes the use of military drones from targeted killing in his article \"Efficiency in Bello and ad Bellum: Making the Use of Force Too Easy?\". He says targeted killing as response to threats and to prevent potential terrorist attacks is justified.\n\nThe final portion of the book analyzes consequentialism within the scope of normative ethics and deontological ethics. Florida State University Tobias Simon Eminent Scholar Fernando Tesón writes in his essay \"Targeted Killing in War and Peace: A Philosophical Analysis\" that targeted killing is particularly justified against terrorists because they use tactics specifically designed to kill civilians. University of Illinois law and philosophy professor Michael Moore says in \"Targeted Killings and the Morality of Hard Choices\" that targeted killing can be seen as justified through both deontological and consequentialist models. University of Pennsylvania School of Law professor Leo Katz writes in \"Targeted Killing and the Strategic Use of Self-Defense\" that there is a danger of a state government artificially generating instances in which it asserts it must use targeted killing in self-defense. He warns against situations in which governments find it easier to kill terrorists than to put them through due process of law. Katz concludes that current regulations support targeted killing because existing law does not consider his argument and justifies the tactical elimination of terrorists.\n\n\"Targeted Killings: Law and Morality in an Asymmetrical World\" was reviewed in the \"European Journal of International Law\" by University of Potsdam international and European law professor Robin Geiß. The reviewer wrote that the book \"is a thought-provoking contribution that takes a refreshingly broad and timely approach in addressing the legal, ethical, and strategic-political dimension of the contemporary debate over targeted killings\". Geiß concluded, \"There is some overlap between the chapters, their relationship is not always evident, and as much as the interdisciplinary approach of this volume is to be appreciated, assembling and interlinking the different legal, ethical, and political findings in an overarching, concluding chapter would have been particularly useful. Nevertheless, the book reflects the entire spectrum of diverging views on the matter, and adds an important impetus to move the current debate forward.\"\n\nAssistant Professor and Head of Reference at Leonard Lief Library, Lehman College, City University of New York, Madeline E. Cohen wrote in an article for the \"International Journal of Legal Information\", \"Within the context of moral and legal principles, and military strategy, the subject of targeted killings is analyzed in great detail. These essays are interdisciplinary in their approach, and give various sides of arguments on this rich subject.\" She concluded, \"An excellent introduction by Andrew Altman provides an overview of 'Our Asymmetric World' and models used to combat terrorism. References, tables of cases and legal instruments are included making this an excellent reference for further research.\"\n\nAbraham David Sofaer reviewed the book for the \"Texas Law Review\". Sofaer wrote, \"It is a beautiful book: large, with print size that is easy on the eyes, and with sufficient space between lines of text to make the complex material at least visually digestible. It has useful tables of cases, instruments, legislation, and abbreviations, as well as an index.\" He commented, \"it should be clear that a reader seeking a single, nonredundant and objective account of targeted killing should find another book. On the other hand, this collection of essays provides several original and useful treatments of various aspects of the subject.\" Sofaer said that the book could have given more weight to the law enforcement model of how and when to use deadly force against individuals.\n\nThe collection also received a review from University of Geneva postdoctoral research fellow in the faculty of law, Steven J. Barela, in the \"Journal of International Criminal Justice\". Barela described the book as \"a constructive work with a wide purview onto one of the most pressing and difficult policy questions of our time\". He stated, \"this volume provides a valuable entry point for investigating this kaleidoscope of legal and moral issues\". Steven R. Ratner of the University of Michigan Law School reviewed the book for the \"American Journal of International Law\", writing, \"In light of the complexity of the legal and moral issues, \"Targeted Killings\" is a welcome addition to the academic literature. It aims to combine in one volume perspectives from legal experts, moral philosophers, and military planners.\" University of Reading law lecturer Robert P. Barnidge, Jr. wrote in the \"Boston University International Law Journal\", \"\"Targeted Killings\" also provides some clarity as to the threshold between armed conflict and situations falling short of armed conflict\". He concluded, \"[the book's] main contribution to the discussion lies in its focus on the willing use of violence on a significant scale by an organized group\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

Signed during the presidency of James Monroe, it resolved standing boundary issues between the two nations. The treaty allowed for joint occupation and settlement of the Oregon Country, known to the British and in Canadian history as the Columbia District of the Hudson's Bay Company, and including the southern portion of its sister district New Caledonia.\n\nThe two nations agreed to a boundary line involving the 49th parallel north, in part because a straight-line boundary would be easier to survey than the pre-existing boundaries based on watersheds. The treaty marked both the United Kingdom's last permanent major loss of territory in what is now the Continental United States and the United States' only permanent significant cession of North American territory to a foreign power. Britain ceded all of Rupert's Land south of the 49th parallel and east of the Continental Divide, including all of the Red River Colony south of that latitude, while the United States ceded the northernmost edge of the Missouri Territory north of the 49th parallel.\n\nThe treaty name is variously cited as\n\"Convention respecting fisheries, boundary, and the restoration of slaves\",\n\"Convention of Commerce (Fisheries, Boundary and the Restoration of Slaves)\",\nand \"Convention of Commerce between His Majesty and the United States of America\".\n\n\nThe treaty was negotiated for the U.S. by Albert Gallatin, ambassador to France, and Richard Rush, minister to the UK; and for the UK by Frederick John Robinson, Treasurer of the Royal Navy and member of the privy council, and Henry Goulburn, an undersecretary of state. The treaty was signed on October 20, 1818. Ratifications were exchanged on January 30, 1819. The Convention of 1818, along with the Rush–Bagot Treaty of 1817, marked the beginning of improved relations between the British Empire and its former colonies, and paved the way for more positive relations between the U.S. and Canada, notwithstanding that repelling U.S. invasion was a defence priority in Canada until 1928.\n\nDespite the relatively friendly nature of the agreement, it nevertheless resulted in a fierce struggle for control of the Oregon Country in the following two decades. The British-chartered Hudson's Bay Company, having previously established a trading network centered on Fort Vancouver on the lower Columbia River, with other forts in what is now eastern Washington and Idaho as well as on the Oregon Coast and in Puget Sound, undertook a harsh campaign to restrict encroachment by U.S. fur traders to the area. By the 1830s, with pressure in the U.S. mounting to annex the region outright, the company undertook a deliberate policy to exterminate all fur-bearing animals from the Oregon Country, in order to both maximize its remaining profit and to delay the arrival of U.S. mountain men and settlers. The policy of discouraging settlement was undercut to some degree by the actions of John McLoughlin, Chief Factor of the Hudson's Bay Company at Fort Vancouver, who regularly provided relief and welcome to U.S. immigrants who had arrived at the post over the Oregon Trail.\n\nBy the middle 1840s, the tide of U.S. immigration, as well as a U.S. political movement to claim the entire territory, led to a renegotiation of the agreement. The Oregon Treaty in 1846 permanently established the 49th parallel as the boundary between the United States and British North America to the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\n"}

The hereditary dispute between the Stuttgart part and the part of Urach were settled after 40 years. Residing in Urach, Count Eberhard V, later Duke Eberhard I of Württemberg, obtained rule and moved the capital to Stuttgart. The succession was laid down for the ruling count in the Stuttgart part of the country, Eberhard VI. With this treaty, that was worked out with collaboration of the council of Württembergian subjects, the indivisibility of Württemberg and the primogeniture became contractual. The treaty prevented the division of Württemberg and thus was an important step to the exaltation to a duchy in 1495.

It was created by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL).\n\nThe purpose of the Uniform Securities Act is to provide model legislation that can be adopted by a state to deal with securities fraud at the state level, supplementing enforcement and regulation efforts of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Not all investments are covered federally and not all investment dealers are registered at the federal level, so the SEC does not have authority over all securities and securities transactions. As a result, there is a need for state-level security regulations to protect investors with respect to these securities. The Uniform Securities Act provides model legislation that can be enacted by a state to provide this protection. The state security laws are often known as blue sky laws.\n\nThe Act was first promulgated in 1930, when it was entitled the \"Uniform Sales of Securities Act of 1930.\" The 1930 Act met with limited success, enacted by only five jurisdictions. In 1943, the NCCUSL dropped the Act from its list of Uniform Acts.\n\nThe Act was substantially revised in 1956, as the \"Uniform Securities Act of 1956\". This revision was much more successful, and was adopted by 37 jurisdictions. The act was revised again in 1985 as the \"Uniform Securities Act of 1985\", and amended in 1988, but few states adopted these changes, and instead continued to operate under the 1956 Act.\n\nThe most recent version of the Act is the Uniform Securities Act of 2002\" which was last revised in 2005. http://www.uniformlaws.org/shared/docs/securities/securities_final_05.pdf . , the 2002 Act has been enacted in Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Vermont, Wisconsin and the US Virgin Islands. \n\nThe 2002 Act has been endorsed by the following organizations: \n\n\n\n"}

His father, Alexander Countryman, was the under sheriff of Musselshell County and his mother, Carrie Harriman, a homemaker. The family moved to Longview, Washington, where Vern excelled at high school athletics and was class president both his junior and senior years.\n\nIn 1939, he was graduated with a B.A. in political science from the University of Washington and was inducted into \"Phi Beta Kappa\". In 1942, he graduated from the University of Washington Law School, where he was president of the \"Washington Law Review\" editorial board (overlapping with Donald R. Colvin).\n\nOn November 9, 1940, he married Vera Marie Pound (July 19, 1917 – December 2, 1994), a daughter of former Harvard Law School Dean Roscoe Pound (October 27, 1870 – June 30, 1964), with whom he had two daughters: Debra Green and Kay Briggs.\n\nCountryman worked as an attorney with the National Labor Relations Board in Seattle before serving as a clerk from 1942 to 1943 for Justice William O. Douglas (October 16, 1898 – January 19, 1980) of the U.S. Supreme Court. He then served with the Army Air Force in Italy during World War II, rising to First Lieutenant. After his discharge in 1946, he served as Assistant Attorney General of Washington State and, from 1946 to 1947, as an instructor at the University of Washington Law School.\n\nIn 1947-48, Countryman was a graduate student at Yale Law School before joining the faculty. He was an assistant professor of law from 1948 to 1950 and an associate professor from 1950 to 1955.\n\nCountryman was a prominent bankruptcy scholar, following in the footsteps of Wesley Sturges (November 3, 1893-November 1962) and his mentor, William O. Douglas. His casebook with J. William Moore, \"Debtors' and Creditors' Rights: Cases and Materials\", which was first published in 1947 and went through four editions by 1975, \"took a novel approach to the subject, by providing the evolution of both the non-bankruptcy and bankruptcy systems of creditors' remedies, thereby facilitating a comparative evaluation of their merits.\"\n\nWhile at Yale, Countryman wrote a number of articles on creditor and debtor rights and one book, \"Un-American Activities in the State of Washington: The Work of the Canwell Committee\" (1951), which was an attack on that state's version of the House Un-American Activities Committee; the state committee purged the University of Washington faculty of communist sympathizers.\n\nCountryman was denied tenure by Yale, despite the Law School faculty's positive recommendation, because of that book, which the university President, A. Whitney Griswold (October 27, 1906 – April 19, 1963), was said to have considered of insufficient academic quality to merit tenure. Many faculty members, however, believed the decision was based on Countryman's left-wing politics and the tenure denial was therefore a cause célèbre. Yale offered an extension of Countryman's contract to improve his scholarly output for reconsideration, but he resigned instead.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Countryman also locked horns with leading commentators in his promotion of free speech. Conservative author William F. Buckley, Jr. (November 24, 1925 – February 27, 2008), called Countryman's 1952 critique of \"God and Man at Yale\" a close runner up to \"the most acidulous review of the lot.\"\n\nFrom 1955 to 1959 Countryman practiced law as a partner with Shea, Greenman & Gardner in Washington, D.C., before becoming Dean of the University of New Mexico School of Law in 1959.\n\nIn 1959, he published a collection of opinions by Justice Douglas prefaced by a brief biographical sketch. The opinions span the spectrum of individual freedom and the application of the Bill of Rights.\n\nIn 1964, Countryman accepted an offer to become a professor at Harvard Law School. At Harvard, he advocated the rights of debtors. He was also a specialist in commercial law, secured transactions law and civil liberties. In 1973, he was named the \"Royall Professor of Law,\" the oldest professorship at the law school. In 1987, he became a professor emeritus.\n\nHe was a founding trustee of the National Consumer Law Center, which annually presents the \"Vern Countryman Award\" to honor lawyers who have contributed to the rights and welfare of low-income consumers.\n\n\nCountryman, Vern (1951). \"Un-American Activities in the State of Washington: The Work of the Canwell Committee\".

Blum was born in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia in 1931, and observed his bar-mitzvah in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. He immigrated to British Mandate for Palestine in 1945. Blum earned his law degree from the University of London.\n\nBlum joined the faculty of Hebrew University in 1965 and until retiring in 2001 occupied the Hersch Lauterpacht Chair in International Law there. He has served as a senior research scholar at the University of Michigan, and visiting professor in the law schools of the University of Texas, New York University, Tulane University, the USC Gould School of Law, and others. In 1968 he served as a UNESCO Fellow at the University of Sydney in Australia. He has written several books and published many scholarly articles on international legal problems in law journals in English, Hebrew and German. He is currently the law editor of the \"Encyclopaedia Hebraica.\"\n\nIn 1968, Blum worked for the United Nations Office of Legal Counsel. He was a member of Israeli delegation to 3rd UN Conference on the Law of the Sea in 1973. In 1976 he was part of the Israeli delegation to the 31st session of UN General Assembly. He served as Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations for six years, from 1978 to 1984.\n\nHe was a member of the Israeli negotiating team that drafted the peace treaty with Egypt (Camp David Accords) in 1978, the Blair House negotiations in March 1979 and the Israeli legal team at the Taba arbitration talks between Israel and Egypt between 1986 and 1988.\n\nAs the Ambassador to the United Nations, Blum was often critical of it, saying that the UN \"fans the flames of the Middle East conflict.\" \"The New York Times\" quoted him as saying that \"The essence of the Middle East conflict has always been and remains the persistent enmity of Arab states towards the Jewish national renaissance.\"\nAs UN envoy, he made headlines for \"scolding\" a group of 133 American Jewish law students protesting Israel's invasion of Lebanon and protesting Jewish settlements in West Bank and Gaza. He questioned the factual, as well as the moral position, of the students' view, saying that they \"have not given the slightest indication of their willingness to bear any personal consequences of their patronizing and fortuitous advice.\" \n\n"}
