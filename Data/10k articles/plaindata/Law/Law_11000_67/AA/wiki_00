The power to create Acts was conferred to the Parliament by section 28 of the Scotland Act 1998 following the successful 1997 referendum on devolution.\n\nPrior to the establishment of the Parliament under the 1998 Act, all post-union laws specific to Scotland were passed at the Westminster Parliament. Although the Westminster Parliament has retained the ability to legislate for Scotland, by convention it does not do so without the consent of the Scottish Parliament. Since the passing of the 1998 Act, the Westminster Parliament has passed five public general acts that apply only to Scotland.\n\nA draft Act is known as a Bill. Once it is passed by the Scottish Parliament and receives royal assent, the Bill becomes an Act and is then a part of Scots Law.\n\nA Public Bill is a Bill which is introduced by a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP), and which will deal with the general laws of Scotland, rather than the law as it applies to a single person or organisation. Public Bills are further divided into categories based on the MSP who proposed them: \"Government Bills\" (known as \"Executive Bills\" before September 2012) for a member of the Scottish Government; \"Committee Bills\" for the convener of one of the committees of the Scottish Parliament; or \"Members' Bills\" for any MSP who is not a member of the Scottish Government.\n\nPublic Bills are the most common type of Bill. In the Parliament's fourth session, 81 of the 86 proposed Bills were Public Bills.\n\nA Private Bill (or sometimes a \"Personal Bill\") is a Bill which will apply only to the Bill's promoter: the specific person, corporation, or unincorporated entity which is putting the Bill before Parliament. For example, the National Trust for Scotland was created by Act of Parliament in 1935, making its constitution part of the law. As a result, amending the Trust's constitution required an Act of the Scottish Parliament – the National Trust for Scotland (Governance etc.) Act 2013. Certain Private Bills are classified as \"Works Bills\". These are Bills to grant the statutory power to construct or alter works such as bridges, docks, roads, or tunnels, or the statutory power to compulsorily purchase or use land or buildings.\n\nUnlike with Public Bills, anyone with suitable interest in the outcome of a Private Bill (such as residents near the site of a proposed work) can lodge an objection and have it considered by a parliamentary committee.\n\nPrivate Bills also differ from Public Bills in that they can legislate outside of the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament. If all of the provisions of a Private Bill are within the Parliament's legislative competence, then the Bill's passage into an Act is covered by the Parliament's standing orders. If not, however, then the Bill's passage is covered under a 1936 Act of the UK Parliament.\n\nThe number of Private Bills is low compared to Public Bills. In the fourth session of the Parliament, five of the 86 proposed Bills were Private Bills.\n\nA Hybrid Bill is a class of Bill introduced in 2009. It is a combination of the characteristics of Public and Private Bills and is intended for use where its contents relate to general law or public policy, but where those provisions may negatively affect specific persons or bodies (rather than the public in general). Hybrid Bills are always introduced by a member of the Scottish Government and, like Public Bills, can make general law provisions within the Scottish Parliament's legislative competence. However, like Private Bills, any person with a suitable interest can object and have their objections considered by a parliamentary committee, and a Hybrid Bill can be classed as a \"Works Bill\" depending on its provisions.\n\nThe first Hybrid Bill put before the Parliament was the \"Forth Crossing Bill\" on 16 November 2009. This Bill was later passed as the Forth Crossing Act 2011, which granted the Scottish Government the power to build the Queensferry Crossing.\n\nThere are a number of stages a Bill must pass through before it becomes an Act, but to pass through these stages it must first be introduced to Parliament. To be introduced, the Bill is prepared in accordance with the Parliament's standing orders along with its supporting documents: statements on legislative competence; cost estimates relating to implementation of the Bill; objective explanations of the Bill's provisions; any reports from consultations relating to the Bill; and a report from the Auditor General for Scotland if the Bill authorises charges on the Scottish Consolidated Fund. \n\nFollowing a Bill's introduction to Parliament, the first three stages a Bill passes through are broadly defined by section 36 of the Scotland Act 1998. The precise process is set out by the Parliament's standing orders, and varies slightly depending on how the Bill is classified.\n\nThe first stage after introduction is a debate of the Bill's intentions and its general principles, referred to in the standing orders as \"Stage 1\" and required by section 36(1)(a) of the 1998 Act. The Bill is referred to the relevant parliamentary committee or committees, plus the \"Delegated Powers and Law Reform\" committee (DPLR) if the Bill allows the creation of secondary legislation. One of the relevant committees is designated the lead committee, and that committee prepares a report on the Bill's general principles. The DPLR, if it is involved, will also prepare a report on the necessity of conferring the power to create secondary legislation.\n\nOnce prepared, the reports are presented to Parliament for consideration. The Parliament may move to have a further report produced by the lead committee (either on the Bill as a whole or on a specific part), or proceed to debate. A debate considers the committee reports, and is concluded by the MSP in charge of the Bill moving \"that the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Bill.\" If that motion receives the support of the Parliament, the Bill proceeds to \"Stage 2\". If the motion fails, the Bill fails and does not proceed.\n\nIn certain cases it is necessary to receive Crown Consent before the Bill can proceed, such as when the Bill affects royal prerogative or the private interests of the monarch or monarchs. Generally, Crown Consent will only be sought in \"Stage 1\" if a key component or a majority of the Bill deals with matters that require consent.\n\nOnce the Parliament agrees to the general principles of a Bill, the Bill progresses to \"Stage 2\". In this stage, the Bill may be referred back to the lead committee designated in \"Stage 1\", or may be transferred to one or more other committees. Occasionally, a Bill is transferred to a committee of the entire Scottish Parliament. The committees the Bill is referred to then cover the Bill in detail, and must agree on each individual portion (in contrast to \"Stage 1\", where only the general idea of the Bill must be agreed on). Specifically, the committees must agree on individual sections of the Bill, schedules to the Bill, and the Bill's long title, and must do so in that order unless the committees or Parliament decide otherwise.\n\nIn this stage, a Bill can be amended, and any submitted amendments to a portion of the Bill must be considered before a committee can agree on that portion. MSPs not on any \"Stage 2\" committees can participate in discussion and submit amendments, but can't vote on whether amendments are accepted or rejected. Depending on the amendments submitted, it may be required to update the Bill's supporting documents. The \"Stage 2\" committees, unlike the \"Stage 1\" committees, do not produce a report on the Bill.\n\n\"Stage 2\" partially fulfils the requirements of section 36(1)(b) of the 1998 Act, along with \"Stage 3\".\n\nFollowing committee consideration, the Bill is presented \"as amended\" to a meeting of the entire Scottish Parliament, where it is again debated and can again be amended. This is \"Stage 3\", and fulfils the requirements of sections 36(1)(b) and 36(1)(c) of the 1998 Act. Unlike in \"Stage 2\", the Parliament will only debate those amendments selected by the Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament. Amendments are considered in order of the portions of the Bill they amend, unless Parliament agrees to consider them in a different order.\n\nFollowing the debate and consideration of the Bill and any \"Stage 3\" amendments, the Parliament may opt to send the Bill back to \"Stage 2\" for further consideration. However, if it is felt that adequate consideration has already been had, the Parliament will vote on whether to pass the Bill. If the Bill does not receive a majority in-favour votes, or if the vote is invalid, the Bill fails and does not proceed. The vote is considered invalid when an electronic vote is taken and fewer than a quarter of (129 total) MSPs vote.\n\nIf Crown Consent is required and was not gained before \"Stage 3\", it will usually be gained before the start of the vote on whether to pass the Bill.\n\nOnce passed by Parliament, the stages a Bill passes through before becoming an Act are set out by sections 32 to 36 of the Scotland Act 1998. These stages generally do not involve Parliament.\n\nA passed Bill may be challenged by the Advocate General for Scotland, the Lord Advocate, or the Attorney General, who can refer it under section 33 of the 1998 Act to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom for review. The Supreme Court will then determine whether the Bill is within the Parliament's legislative competence and whether the Bill is to be referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) for review. Such a challenge may be lodged within the four weeks following the passing or approval of the Bill. If a Bill is referred to the ECJ, the Parliament can move to reconsider the Bill and have the reference withdrawn. If the reference is only to the Supreme Court, the Parliament must wait for the Court's decision. This type of statutory challenge is termed a \"Section 33 reference\".\n\nThe Secretary of State may also challenge by order under section 35 of the 1998 Act. Section 35 provides that such challenges must be on the grounds that the Bill: is incompatible with international obligations; is incompatible with the interests of defence or national security; or deals with reserved matters and will have \"an adverse effect on the operation of the law.\" These orders can be created within the four weeks following the passing or approval of the Bill, or within four weeks following the lodging of a section 33 reference against the Bill. The orders can remain active indefinitely, and are referred to as \"Section 35 orders\".\n\nThe final stage before a Bill can be classed as an Act is the receiving of royal assent – the approval of the monarch. Although the actual process of royal assent is a formality – royal assent has not been refused for years – sections 28 and 32 of the 1998 Act mean that a Bill cannot become an Act without royal assent. A Bill is submitted for royal assent by the Presiding Officer, who may only do so after either waiting for the four-week statutory challenge period to expire or after receiving confirmation that no statutory challenge will be lodged.\n\nA Bill receives royal assent through Letters Patent under the Great Seal of Scotland. The Letters Patent are of the form:\n\nOnce the Letters Patent are received and sealed, the Bill becomes an Act of the Scottish Parliament. However, parts of or even the entire Act may not immediately have effect. An extreme example of this is the Easter Act 1928, an Act of the United Kingdom Parliament which has never been put into effect.\n\nA Bill, after becoming an Act, does not necessarily have legal force immediately. Most Acts wholly or partially come into force the day after royal assent; many include provisions that must be \"brought into force\" by a commencement order (a statutory instrument). One example is the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2016, which includes provisions for both:\n\nAs of July 2016, two commencement orders have brought sections 84 and 112 of that Act, respectively, into force. Section 84 was brought into force on 10 March 2016, and section 112 on 1 July 2016.\n\nThe numbering of Acts of the Scottish Parliament closely resembles that of Acts of other devolved legislatures in the UK, and of Acts of the UK Parliament. An Act's number consists of the calendar year in which the Act received royal assent, followed by the abbreviation \"asp\" (for \"Act of the Scottish Parliament\"), followed by a number which increases consecutively from one with each Act in the calendar year. Thus, the first Act of 2016 is numbered \"2016 asp 1\", the second is \"2016 asp 2\", and so on. The first Act of 2017 is \"2017 asp 1\" because the final number resets each calendar year.\n\nIf multiple Acts receive royal assent on the same day, they are numbered based on the order in which their Letters Patent are received. If multiple Acts are specified in a single Letters Patent, the Acts are numbered by the order in which they are mentioned in the Letters.\n\nAn Act can be cited in a number of ways: by reference to its short title (\"Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2016\"); by reference to its full number (\"2016 asp 1\"); or both (\"Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2016 (asp 1)\"), although the exact appearance of this type of citation generally depends on the style guide in use.\n\nThe enactment formula for Acts of the Scottish Parliament is non-typical – unlike many others, it doesn't begin with a variation of the phrase \"be it enacted...\" or state from where the Parliament derives authority (a deity or the sovereign). Instead, it states the date of the Bill being passed by the Parliament and the date of that Bill receiving royal assent (i.e. becoming an Act), in the manner as follows:\n\nThe enactment formula is then immediately followed by the Act's long title, and then the contents of the Act.\n\nA division of a Bill or Act is a component, generally numbered, dealing with increasingly discrete topics, equivalent to the chapters of a book. For example, the highest-level division might be \"trees,\" with two subdivisions for evergreen and deciduous trees, with each of those having subdivisions for particular species of trees. Different divisions are used depending on the role of that division (e.g. \"parts\" versus \"schedules\").\n\nA table of divisions is shown. In this table \"Continuous?\" indicates whether the numbering of those divisions continues across divisions, or whether the numbering resets to the first value in the sequence at the start of the next-highest-level division. The \"Optional?\" column indicates whether, within that portion of the Act, that division can be omitted. While addenda are themselves optional, an addendum to an Act must use the \"paragraph\" division.\n\nThe main body matter of an Act is divided into parts, then chapters, then sections, then subsections, then paragraphs, then sub- and sub-sub-paragraphs (or \"heads\"). The only division that must be used is the section; all others are optional, although chapters cannot be used without parts. These divisions are almost always numbered, although paragraphs may occasionally not be numbered, such as when being used for a list of definitions.\n\nSome Acts have schedules, a type of addendum, which give additional information. Schedules are commonly used to provide lists of amendments to other Acts, but may be used anywhere it may not be appropriate to include the information in the Act's main text. For example, section 1 of the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005 gives a general definition of the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator, while schedule 1 to that Act gives more detail; and schedule 1 to the Budget (Scotland) Act 2016 sets out the purposes for which money will be allocated to the Scottish Government, and how much money will be allocated to those purposes.\n\nIf there are multiple schedules, each is individually numbered; otherwise a schedule is not numbered. Schedules are then divided into parts, then chapters, then paragraphs, and then sub-paragraphs in the same way as the sections of the main body of the Act. As with the main body, parts and chapters are optional, and chapters cannot be used without parts. Although schedules still have the full force of law like sections, they are counted as additions rather than main components of the Act, and so a schedule is said to be \"to an Act\" rather than \"of an Act.\"\n\nBoth the main body of the Act and its addenda may have cross-headings. These are non-numbered divisions that don't affect the numbering of other divisions, and serve to make reading the document easier. For example, Part 1 Chapter 2 (\"Scottish Charity Register\") of the \"Charities\" Act mentioned above has cross-headings dividing it into portions related to the register itself, applying for entry to the register, acceptable names for charities on the register, and so on. Cross-headings are shown in italic type.\n\n"}

(Target prices were eliminated by the 1996 farm bill (P.L. 104-127), but restored by the 2002 farm bill (P.L. 101-171, Sec. 1104).) It reduced payment limitations to $20,000 (from $55,000 set in 1970) for all program crops. The Act might be considered the first omnibus farm bill because it went beyond simply authorizing farm commodity programs. It authorized disaster payments and disaster reserve inventories; created the Rural Environmental Conservation Program; amended the Food Stamp Act of 1964 (P.L. 88-525), authorized the use of commodities for feeding low income mothers and young children (the origin of the Commodity Supplemental Food Program; and amended the Rural Development Act of 1972 (P.L. 92-419).\n"}

They support the conductive cells of the phloem and provide strength to the stem. Some of the economically important bast fibres are obtained from herbs cultivated in agriculture, as for instance flax, hemp, or ramie, but also bast fibres from wild plants, as stinging nettle, and trees such as lime or linden, wisteria, and mulberry have been used in the past. Bast fibres are classified as soft fibres, and are flexible. Fibres from monocotyledonous plants, called \"leaf fibre\", are classified as hard fibres and are stiff.\n\nSince the valuable fibres are located in the phloem, they must often be separated from the xylem material (\"woody core\"), and sometimes also from the epidermis. The process for this is called retting, and can be performed by micro-organisms either on land (nowadays the most important) or in water, or by chemicals (for instance high pH and chelating agents) or by pectinolytic enzymes. In the phloem, bast fibres occur in bundles that are glued together by pectin and calcium ions. More intense retting separates the fibre bundles into elementary fibres, that can be several centimetres long. Often bast fibres have higher tensile strength than other kinds, and are used in high-quality textiles (sometimes in blends with cotton or synthetic fibres), ropes, yarn, paper, composite materials and burlap. An important property of bast fibres is that they contain a special structure, the \"fibre node\", that represents a weak point, and gives flexibility. Seed hairs, such as cotton, do not have nodes.\n\nPlants that have been used for bast fibre include flax (from which linen is made), hemp, jute, kenaf, kudzu, linden, milkweed, nettle, okra, paper mulberry, ramie, and roselle hemp.\n\nBast fibres are processed for use in carpet, yarn, rope, geotextile (netting or matting), traditional carpets, hessian or burlap, paper, sacks, etc. Bast fibres are also used in the non-woven, moulding, and composite technology industries for the manufacturing of non-woven mats and carpets, composite boards as furniture materials, automobile door panels and headliners, etc. From prehistoric times through at least the early twentieth century, bast shoes were woven from bast strips in the forest areas of Eastern Europe.\n\nWhere no other source of tanbark was available, bast has also been used for tanning leather.\n\n"}
{"id": "3253311", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3253311", "title": "Causation (law)", "text": "Causation (law)\n\nCausation is the \"causal relationship between conduct and result\". In other words, causation provides a means of connecting conduct with a resulting effect, typically an injury. In criminal law, it is defined as the \"actus reus\" (an action) from which the specific injury or other effect arose and is combined with \"mens rea\" (a state of mind) to comprise the elements of guilt. Causation only applies where a result has been achieved and therefore is immaterial with regard to inchoate offenses.\n\nLegal systems more or less try to uphold the notions of fairness and justice. If a state is going to penalize a person or require that person pay compensation to another for losses incurred, liability is imposed according to the idea that those who injure others should take responsibility for their actions. Although some parts of any legal system will have qualities of strict liability, in which the \"mens rea\" is immaterial to the result and subsequent liability of the actor, most look to establish liability by showing that the defendant was the cause of the particular injury or loss.\n\nEven the youngest children quickly learn that, with varying degrees of probability, consequences flow from physical acts and omissions. The more predictable the outcome, the greater the likelihood that the actor caused the injury or loss intentionally. There are many ways in which the law might capture this simple rule of practical experience: that there is a natural flow to events, that a reasonable man in the same situation would have foreseen this consequence as likely to occur, that the loss flowed naturally from the breach of contractual duties or tortuous actions, etc. However it is phrased, the essence of the degree of fault attributed will lie in the fact that reasonable people try to avoid injuring others, so if harm was foreseeable, there should be liability to the extent that the extent of the harm actually resulting was foreseeable.\n\nCausation of an event alone is insufficient to create legal liability.\n\nSometimes causation is one part of a multi-stage test for legal liability. For example, for the defendant to be held liable for the tort of negligence, the defendant must have owed the plaintiff a duty of care, breached that duty, by so doing caused damage to the plaintiff, and that damage must not have been too remote. Causation is just one component of the tort.\n\nOn other occasions, causation is the only requirement for legal liability (other than the fact that the outcome is proscribed). For example, in the law of product liability, the courts have come to apply to principle of \"strict liability\" : the fact that the defendant's product caused the plaintiff harm is the only thing that matters. The defendant need not also have been negligent.\n\nOn still other occasions, causation is irrelevant to legal liability altogether. For example, under a contract of indemnity insurance, the insurer agrees to indemnify the victim for harm not caused by the insurer, but by other parties.\n\nBecause of the difficulty in establishing causation, it is one area of the law where the case law overlaps significantly with general doctrines of analytic philosophy to do with causation. The two subjects have long been intermingled.\n\nWhere establishing causation is required to establish legal liability, it usually involves a two-stage inquiry, firstly establishing 'factual' causation, then 'legal' causation.\n\n‘Factual’ causation must be established before inquiring into legal causation, perhaps by assessing if the defendant acted in the plaintiff’s loss.\n\nDetermining ‘legal’ causation often involves a question of public policy regarding the sort of situation in which, despite the outcome of the factual enquiry, the defendant might nevertheless be released from liability, or impose liability.\n\nThe usual method of establishing factual causation is the \"but-for test\". The but for test inquires ‘But for the defendant’s act, would the harm have occurred?’ A shoots and wounds B. We ask ‘But for A's act, would B have been wounded?’ The answer is ‘No.’ So we conclude that A caused the harm to B. The but for test is a test of necessity. It asks was it ‘necessary’ for the defendant’s act to have occurred for the harm to have occurred. In New South Wales, this requirement exists in s 5D of the \"Civil Liability Act 2002\" (NSW), reinforcing established common law principles.\n\nOne weakness in the but-for test arises in situations where each of several acts alone are sufficient to cause the harm. For example, if both A and B fire what would alone be fatal shots at C at approximately the same time, and C dies, it becomes impossible to say that but-for A's shot, or but-for B's shot alone, C would have died. Taking the but-for test literally in such a case would seem to make neither A nor B responsible for C's death.\n\nThe courts have generally accepted the but for test notwithstanding these weaknesses, qualifying it by saying that causation is to be understood “as the man in the street” would, or by supplementing it with “common sense”.\n\nThis dilemma was handled in the United States in \"State v. Tally\", , where the court ruled that: “The assistance given ... need not contribute to criminal result in the sense that but for it the result would not have ensued. It is quite sufficient if it facilitated a result that would have transpired without it.” Using this logic, A and B are liable in that no matter who was responsible for the fatal shot, the other \"facilitated\" the criminal act even though his shot was not necessary to deliver the fatal blow.\n\nHowever, legal scholars have attempted to make further inroads into what explains these difficult cases. Some scholars have proposed a test of sufficiency instead of a test of necessity. H. L. A. Hart and Tony Honoré, and later Richard Wright, have said that something is a cause if it is a ‘necessary element of a set of conditions jointly sufficient for the result’. This is known as the NESS test. In the case of the two hunters, the set of conditions required to bring about the result of the victim's injury would include a gunshot to the eye, the victim being in the right place at the right time, gravity, etc. In such a set, either of the hunters' shots would be a member, and hence a cause. This arguably gives us a more theoretically satisfying reason to conclude that something was a cause of something else than by appealing to notions of intuition or common sense.\n\nHart and Honore, in their famous work \"Causation in the Law\", also tackle the problem of 'too many causes'. For them, there are degrees of causal contribution. A member of the NESS set is a \"causally relevant condition\". This is elevated into a \"cause\" where it is a deliberate human intervention, or an abnormal act in the context. So, returning to our hunter example, hunter A's grandmother's birth is a causally relevant condition, but not a \"cause\". On the other hand, hunter A's gunshot, being a deliberate human intervention in the ordinary state of affairs, is elevated to the status of \"cause\". An intermediate position can be occupied by those who \"occasion\" harm, such as accomplices. Imagine an accomplice to a murder who drives the principal to the scene of the crime. Clearly the principal's act in committing the murder is a \"cause\" (on the but for or NESS test). So is the accomplice's act in driving the principal to the scene of the crime. However, the causal contribution is not of the same level (and, incidentally, this provides some basis for treating principals and accomplices differently under criminal law). Leon Green and Jane Stapleton are two scholars who take the opposite view. They consider that once something is a \"but for\" (Green) or NESS (Stapleton) condition, that ends the factual inquiry altogether, and anything further is a question of policy.\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that causation may be established in the above situations, the law often intervenes and says that it will nevertheless not hold the defendant liable because in the circumstances the defendant is not to be understood, in a legal sense, as having caused the loss. In the United States, this is known as the doctrine of proximate cause. The most important doctrine is that of \"novus actus interveniens\", which means a ‘new intervening act’ which may ‘cut the chain of causation’.\n\nThe but-for test is factual causation and often gives us the right answer to causal problems, but sometimes not. Two difficulties are immediately obvious. The first is that under the but-for test, almost anything is a cause. But for a tortfeasor's grandmother's birth, the relevant tortious conduct would not have occurred. But for the victim of a crime missing the bus, he or she would not have been at the site of the crime and hence the crime would not have occurred. Yet in these two cases, the grandmother's birth or the victim's missing the bus are not intuitively causes of the resulting harm. This often does not matter in the case where cause is only one element of liability, as the remote actor will most likely not have committed the other elements of the test. The legally liable cause is the one closest to or most proximate to the injury. This is known as the Proximate Cause rule. However, this situation can arise in strict liability situations.\n\nImagine the following. A critically injures B. As B is wheeled to an ambulance, she is struck by lightning. She would not have been struck if she had not been injured in the first place. Clearly then, A caused B's whole injury on the ‘but for’ or NESS test. However, at law, the intervention of a supervening event renders the defendant not liable for the injury caused by the lightning.\n\nThe effect of the principle may be stated simply:\n\nNote, however, that this does not apply if the Eggshell skull rule is used. For details, see article on the Eggshell Skull doctrine.\nactus interveniens\n\nWhen two or more negligent parties, where the consequence of their negligence joins together to cause damages, in a circumstance where either one of them alone would have caused it anyway, each is deemed to be an \"Independent Sufficient Cause,\" because each could be deemed a \"substantial factor,\" and both are held legally responsible for the damages. For example, where negligent firestarter A's fire joins with negligent firestarter B's fire to burn down House C, both A and B are held responsible. (e.g., \"Anderson v. Minneapolis, St: P. & S. St. R.R. Co\"., 146 Minn. 430, 179 N.W. 45 (1920).) This is an element of Legal Cause.\n\nThe other problem is that of overdetermination. Imagine two hunters, A and B, who each negligently fire a shot that takes out C's eye. Each shot on its own would have been sufficient to cause the damage. But for A's shot, would C's eye have been taken out? Yes. The same answer follows in relation to B's shot. But on the but-for test, this leads us to the counterintuitive position that neither shot caused the injury. However, courts have held that in order to prevent each of the defendants avoiding liability for lack of actual cause, it is necessary to hold both of them responsible, See \"Summers v. Tice\", 33 Cal.2d 80, 199 P.2d 1 (1948). This is known, simply, as the \"Summers v. Tice\" Rule.\n\nSuppose that two actors' negligent acts combine to produce one set of damages, where but for either of their negligent acts, no damage would have occurred at all. This is two negligences contributing to a single cause, as distinguished from two separate negligences contributing to two successive or separate causes. These are \"concurrent actual causes\". In such cases, courts have held both defendants liable for their negligent acts. Example: A leaves truck parked in the middle of the road at night with its lights off. B fails to notice it in time and plows into it, where it could have been avoided, except for want of negligence, causing damage to both vehicles. Both parties were negligent. (\"Hill v. Edmonds\", 26 A.D.2d 554, 270 N.Y.S.2d 1020 (1966).)\n\nLegal Causation is usually expressed as a question of 'foreseeability'. An actor is liable for the foreseeable, but not the unforeseeable, consequences of his or her act. For example, it is foreseeable that if I shoot someone on a beach and they are immobilized, they may drown in a rising tide rather than from the trauma of the gunshot wound or from loss of blood. However it is not (generally speaking) foreseeable that they will be struck by lightning and killed by that event.\n\nThis type of causal foreseeability is to be distinguished from foreseeability of extent or kind of injury, which is a question of remoteness of damage, not causation. For example, if I conduct welding work on a dock that lights an oil slick that destroys a ship a long way down the river, it would be hard to construe my negligence as anything other than causal of the ship's damage. There is no \"novus actus interveniens\". However, I may not be held liable if that damage is not of a type foreseeable as arising from my negligence. That is a question of public policy, and not one of causation.\n\nAn example of how foreseeability does not apply to the extent of an injury is the eggshell skull rule. If Neal punched Matt in the jaw, it is foreseeable that Matt will suffer a bodily injury that he will need to go to the hospital for. However, if his jaw is very weak, and his jaw comes completely off from my punch, then the doctor bills, which would have been about $5,000 for wiring his jaw shut had now become $100,000 for a full-blown jaw re-attachment. Neal would still be liable for the entire $100,000, even though $95,000 of those damages were not reasonably foreseeable.\n\nBecause causation in the law is a complex amalgam of fact and policy, other doctrines are also important, such as foreseeability and risk. Particularly in the United States, where the doctrine of 'proximate cause' effectively amalgamates the two-stage factual then legal causation inquiry favoured in the English system, one must always be alert to these considerations in assessing the postulated relationship between two events.\n\nSome aspects of the physical world are so inevitable that it is always reasonable to impute knowledge of their incidence. So if A abandons B on a beach, A must be taken to foresee that the tide comes in and goes out. But the mere fact that B subsequently drowns is not enough. A court would have to consider where the body was left and what level of injury A believed that B had suffered. If B was left in a position that any reasonable person would consider safe but a storm surge caused extensive flooding throughout the area, this might be a \"novus actus\". That B was further injured by an event within a foreseen class does not of itself require a court to hold that every incident falling within that class is a natural link in the chain. Only those causes that are reasonably foreseeable fit naturally into the chain. So if A had heard a weather forecast predicting a storm, the drowning will be a natural outcome. But if this was an event like a flash flood, an entirely unpredictable event, it will be a \"novus actus\".\n\nThe question of A's beliefs is no different. If A honestly believes that B is only slightly injured and so could move himself out of danger without difficulty, how fair is it to say that he \"ought\" to have foreseen? The test is what the reasonable person would have known and foreseen, given what A had done. It is the function of any court to evaluate behaviour. A defendant cannot evade responsibility through a form of wilful blindness. Fault lies not only in what a person actually believes, but also in failing to understand what the vast majority of other people would have understood. Hence, the test is hybrid, looking both at what the defendant actually knew and foresaw (i.e. subjective), and at what the reasonable person would have known (i.e. objective) and then combining the conclusions into a general evaluation of the degree of fault or blameworthiness.\n\nSimilarly, in the quantification of damages generally and/or the partitioning of damages between two or more defendants, the extent of the liability to compensate the plaintiff(s) will be determined by what was reasonably foreseeable. So if, for example, the plaintiff unexpectedly contributed to the extent of the loss suffered, that additional element would not be included in the damages award even though the plaintiff would not have had the opportunity to make this mistake had it not been for the defendant's breach. In cases involving the partitioning of damages between multiple defendants, each will be liable to the extent that their contribution foreseeably produced the loss.\n\nSometimes the reverse situation to a \"novus actus\" occurs, i.e. factual causation cannot be proved but the court nevertheless does want to hold the defendant liable. In \"Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories\", the plaintiff's mother consumed diethylstilbestrol as a miscarriage preventative. The medicine, later re-called from the market, caused the defendant to develop a malignant bladder tumor due to its negligent manufacture. However, there were many manufacturers of that drug in the market. The manufacturer of the particular medication that caused the injury could not be ascertained for certain. The court held that the defendant was liable in proportion to its market share. They departed from traditional notions of pure cause and adopted a ‘risk based’ approach to liability. The defendant was held liable because of the amount of risk it contributed to the occasioning of the harm. Note that a risk theory is not strictly a theory built on notions of cause at all, as, by definition, the person who caused the injury could not be ascertained for certain. However, it does show that legal notions of causation are a complex mixture of factual causes and ideas of public policy relating to the availability of legal remedies. In \"R v Miller\" , the House of Lords said that a person who puts a person in a dangerous position, in that case a fire, will be criminally liable if he does not adequately rectify the situation.\n\nTo be acceptable, any rule of law must be capable of being applied consistently, thus a definition of the criteria for this qualitative analysis must be supplied. Let us assume a purely factual analysis as a starting point. A injures B and leaves him lying in the road. C is a driver who fails to see B on the road and by running over him, contributes to the cause of his death. It would be possible to ask for a detailed medical evaluation at a post mortem to determine the initial degree of injury and the extent to which B's life was threatened, followed by a second set of injuries from the collision and their contribution. If the first incident merely damaged B's leg so that he could not move, it is tempting to assert that C's driving must have been the more substantial cause and so represents a \"novus actus\" breaking the chain. Equally, if B was bleeding to death and the only contribution that the driving made was to break B's arm, the driving is not a \"novus actus\" and does not break the chain. But this approach ignores the issue of A's foresight.\n\nRoads are, by their nature, used by vehicles and it is clearly foreseeable that a person left lying on the road is at risk of being further injured by an inattentive driver. Hence, if A leaves B on the road with knowledge of that risk and a foreseeable event occurs, A remains the more proximate cause. This leaves whether the test of foresight should be subjective, objective or hybrid (i.e. both subjective and objective). Obviously, there is no difficulty in holding A liable if A had actual knowledge of the likelihood that B would be further injured by a driver. The fault which caused the initial injury is compounded by the omission to move B to a safer place or call for assistance. But let us assume that A never averts the possibility of further injury. The issue is now the extent to which knowledge may be imputed objectively.\n\nA difficult issue that has arisen recently is the case where the defendant neither factually causes the harm, nor increases the risk of its occurrence. In \"Chester v Afshar\" , a doctor negligently failed to warn a patient of risks inherent in an operation, specifically cauda equina syndrome. The patient had the operation and a risk materialized causing injury. It was found that even if the patient had been warned, the patient would still have undergone the operation, simply at a different time. The risk of the injury would be the same at both times. Accordingly, the doctor neither caused the injury (because but for the failure to warn, the patient would still have gone ahead with the operation), nor increased the risk of its occurrence (because the risk was the same either way). Yet the House of Lords, embracing a more normative approach to causation, still held the doctor liable. Lawyers and philosophers continue to debate whether and how this changes the state of the law.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "40910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40910", "title": "Common carrier", "text": "Common carrier\n\nA common carrier in common law countries (corresponding to a public carrier as it may be presented in some civil law systems, usually called simply a carrier) is a person or company that transports goods or people for any person or company and that is responsible for any possible loss of the goods during transport. A common carrier offers its services to the general public under license or authority provided by a regulatory body. The regulatory body has usually been granted \"ministerial authority\" by the legislation that created it. The regulatory body may create, interpret, and enforce its regulations upon the common carrier (subject to judicial review) with independence and finality, as long as it acts within the bounds of the enabling legislation.\n\nA common carrier (also called a \"public carrier\" in UK English) is distinguished from a contract carrier, which is a carrier that transports goods for only a certain number of clients and that can refuse to transport goods for anyone else, and from a private carrier. A common carrier holds itself out to provide service to the general public without discrimination (to meet the needs of the regulator's quasi judicial role of impartiality toward the public's interest) for the \"public convenience and necessity.\" A common carrier must further demonstrate to the regulator that it is \"fit, willing, and able\" to provide those services for which it is granted authority. Common carriers typically transport persons or goods according to defined and published routes, time schedules, and rate tables upon the approval of regulators. Public airlines, railroads, bus lines, taxicab companies, phone companies, internet service providers, cruise ships, motor carriers (i.e., canal operating companies, trucking companies), and other freight companies generally operate as common carriers. Under US law, an ocean freight forwarder cannot act as a common carrier.\n\nThe term \"common carrier\" is a common law term, seldom used in continental Europe because it has no exact equivalent in civil-law systems. In continental Europe, the functional equivalent of a common carrier is referred to as a \"public carrier\" (or simply as a \"carrier\"). However, \"public carrier\" in continental Europe is different from \"public carrier\" in British English, where it is a synonym for \"contract carrier.\"\n\nAlthough common carriers generally transport people or goods, in the United States the term may also refer to telecommunications service providers and public utilities. In certain U.S. states, amusement parks that operate roller coasters and comparable rides have been found to be common carriers; a famous example is Disneyland.\n\nRegulatory bodies may also grant carriers the authority to operate under contract with their customers instead of under common carrier authority, rates, schedules and rules. These regulated carriers, known as contract carriers, must demonstrate that they are \"fit, willing and able\" to provide service, according to standards enforced by the regulator. However, contract carriers are specifically not required to demonstrate that they will operate for the \"public convenience and necessity.\" A contract carrier may be authorized to provide service over either fixed routes and schedules, i.e., as regular route carrier or on an \"ad hoc\" basis as an irregular route carrier.\n\nIt should be mentioned that the carrier refers only to the person (legal or physical) that enters into a contract of carriage with the shipper. The carrier does not necessarily have to own or even be in the possession of a means of transport. Unless otherwise agreed upon in the contract, the carrier may use whatever means of transport approved in its operating authority, as long as it is the most favorable from the cargo interests' point of view. The carriers' duty is to get the goods to the agreed destination within the agreed time or within reasonable time. \n\nThe person that is physically transporting the goods on a means of transport is referred to as the \"actual carrier.\" When a carrier subcontracts with another provider, such as an independent contractor or a third-party carrier, the common carrier is said to be providing \"substituted service.\" The same person may hold both common carrier and contract carrier authority. In the case of a rail line in the US, the owner of the property is said to retain a \"residual common carrier obligation,\" unless otherwise transferred (such as in the case of a commuter rail system, where the authority operating passenger trains may acquire the property but not this obligation from the former owner), and must operate the line if service is terminated. \n\nIn contrast, private carriers are not licensed to offer a service to the public. Private carriers generally provide transport on an irregular or \"ad hoc\" basis for their owners.\n\nCarriers were very common in rural areas prior to motorised transport. Regular services by horse-drawn vehicles would ply to local towns, taking goods to market or bringing back purchases for the village. If space permitted, passengers could also travel.\n\nIn the United States, telecommunications carriers are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission under title II of the Communications Act of 1934.\n\nThe Telecommunications Act of 1996 made extensive revisions to the \"Title II\" provisions regarding common carriers and repealed the judicial 1982 AT&T consent decree (often referred to as the \"modification of final judgment\" or \"MFJ\") that effectuated the breakup of AT&T's Bell System. Further, the Act gives telephone companies the option of providing video programming on a common carrier basis or as a conventional cable television operator. If it chooses the former, the telephone company will face less regulation but will also have to comply with FCC regulations requiring what the Act refers to as \"open video systems\". The Act generally bars, with certain exceptions including most rural areas, acquisitions by telephone companies of more than a 10 percent interest in cable operators (and vice versa) and joint ventures between telephone companies and cable systems serving the same areas.\n\nUsing provisions of the Communications Act of 1934, the FCC classified Internet service providers as common carriers, effective June 12, 2015, for the purpose of enforcing net neutrality. Before that time, the Good Samaritan provision of the Communications Decency Act established immunity from liability for third party content on grounds of libel or slander, and the DMCA established that ISPs that comply with the DMCA would not be liable for the copyright violations of third parties on their network. On December 14, 2017, under a new presidential administration, the FCC reversed its own rules on net neutrality, essentially revoking common carrier status as a requirement for internet service providers. The U.S. Senate narrowly passed a non-binding resolution aiming to reverse the FCC's decision and restore FCC's net neutrality rules.\n\nIn the United States, many oil, gas and CO pipelines are common carriers. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulates rates charged and other tariff terms imposed by interstate common carrier pipelines. Intrastate common carrier pipeline tariffs are often regulated by state agencies. The US and many states have delegated the power of eminent domain to common carrier gas pipelines.\n\nCommon carriers are subject to special laws and regulations that differ depending on the means of transport used, e.g. sea carriers are often governed by quite different rules from road carriers or railway carriers. In common law jurisdictions as well as under international law, a common carrier is absolutely liable for goods carried by it, with four exceptions:\nA sea carrier may also, according to the Hague-Visby Rules, escape liability on other grounds than the above-mentioned, e.g. a sea carrier is not liable for damages to the goods if the damage is the result of a fire on board the ship or the result of a navigational error committed by the ship's master or other crewmember.\n\nCarriers typically incorporate further exceptions into a contract of carriage, often specifically claiming not to be a common carrier.\n\nAn important legal requirement for common carrier as public provider is that it cannot \"discriminate,\" that is refuse the service unless there is some compelling reason. As of 2007, the status of Internet service providers as common carriers and their rights and responsibilities is widely debated (network neutrality).\n\nThe term common carrier does not exist in continental Europe but is distinctive to common law systems, particularly law systems in the US.\n\nIn \"Ludditt v Ginger Coote Airways\" the Privy Council (Lord Macmillan, Lord Wright, Lord Porter and Lord Simonds) held the liability of a public or common carrier of passengers is only to carry with due care. This is more limited than that of a common carrier of goods. The complete freedom of a carrier of passengers at common law to make such contracts as he thinks fit was not curtailed by the Railway and Canal Traffic Act 1854, and a specific contract that enlarges, diminishes or excludes his duty to take care (e.g., by a condition that the passenger travels \"at his own risk against all casualties\") cannot be pronounced to be unreasonable if the law authorises it. There was nothing in the provisions of the Canadian Transport Act 1938 section 25 that would invalidate a provision excluding liability. \"Grand Trunk Railway Co of Canada v Robinson\" [1915] A.C. 740 was followed and \"Peek v North Staffordshire Railway\" 11 E.R. 1109 was distinguished.\n\n"}

If such concessions are obtained, they are often justified as protection of the foreign religion (especially in the case of Christians in a Muslim state) such as the ahdname or capitulations granted by the Ottoman Sultan to commercial Diasporas residing in the Ottoman Empire. The Sultan did not see this agreement as a bilateral agreement between equals, but merely as acknowledging the nation of foreigners living within his territory and offering them privileges similar to those given to non-Ottoman subjects. However, the European states viewed the ahdname as formal and official and therefore had difficulty enforcing the privileges to their satisfaction on many occasions.\n\nA few examples:\n\n\nIn other cases a part of a weaker state is completely handed over (without the formal surrender of \"naked\" sovereignty) to be administered as a concession, including the indigenous local population:\n\nIn the small Italian concession in Tientsin (a treaty port, now Tianjin), the Consul was in charge of the entire local administration. A long list of French consuls-general in Shanghai served as both overseers of the French concession in this Chinese port as well as presidents of the metropolis's Municipal Council. This arrangement lasted from January 1848 until 15 May 1946 (shortly after the 28 February formal restoration of power from France to China).\n\nSee main article: Consular court\n\nIn places where consuls had extraterritorial powers consular courts would also be established to handle civil and criminal cases against citizens and subjects of that country. The British had the widest system of consular courts run by the Foreign Office. British consular courts could be found in Africa, the Ottoman Empire, Egypt, China, Japan and Siam.\n"}
{"id": "23599219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23599219", "title": "Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology", "text": "Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology\n\nThe Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology, proposed in 1984 by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and finalized in 1986, spells out the basic federal policy for regulating the development and introduction of products derived from biotechnology.\n\nThis regulatory policy framework that was developed under President Ronald Reagan to ensure safety of the public and to ensure the continuing development of the fledgling biotechnology industry without overly burdensome regulation. The policy as it developed had three tenets: \"(1) U.S. policy would focus on the product of genetic modification (GM) techniques, not the process itself, (2) only regulation grounded in verifiable scientific risks would be tolerated, and (3) GM products are on a continuum with existing products and, therefore, existing statutes are sufficient to review the products.\" These tenets were first described in the Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology, published by the President's Domestic Policy Council Working Group on Biotechnology through the Office of Science and Technology Policy in 1986. \nThe U.S. policy framework contrasts with that of some of its major trading partners: the European Union, Japan, South Korea, China, Australia and New Zealand either have or are establishing separate mandatory labeling requirements for products containing genetically modified organisms.\n\nThis framework governed specific agency policies. For example, the FDA’s 1992 policy statement on genetically engineered plant foods treats \"transferred genetic material and the intended expression product or products\" in food derived from GM crops as food additives subject to existing food additive regulation, under which that material may be considered either generally recognized as safe (GRAS) or not, initially at the producer's determination. If the food additive is not GRAS, the producer is required to submit data proving that the food additive does not \"adulterate\" the food - in other words, that the additive is not injurious to health. With respect to GM food, the FDA retained its ability to take enforcement action any food it found to be \"adulterated\", which would make its producer \"subject to the full range of enforcement measures under the act, including seizure, injunction, and criminal prosecution of those who fail to meet their statutory duty.\"\n\nUSDA regulation of genetically modified crops is based on the Plant Protection Act and its definition of \"plant pest.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18938663", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18938663", "title": "Copyright law of the United States", "text": "Copyright law of the United States\n\nThe copyright law of the United States is intended to encourage the creation of art and culture by rewarding authors and artists with a set of exclusive rights. Copyright law grants authors and artists the exclusive right to make and sell copies of their works, the right to create derivative works, and the right to perform or display their works publicly. These exclusive rights are subject to a time limit, and generally expire 70 years after the author's death. In the United States, any music composed before January 1, 1923, is generally considered public domain.\n\nUnited States copyright law was last generally revised by the Copyright Act of 1976, codified in Title 17 of the United States Code. The United States Constitution explicitly grants Congress the power to create copyright law under Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8, known as the Copyright Clause. Under the Copyright Clause, Congress has the power, \"To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.\"\n\nThe United States Copyright Office handles copyright registration, recording of copyright transfers, and other administrative aspects of copyright law.\n\nUS copyright law traces its lineage back to the British Statute of Anne, which influenced the first US federal copyright law, the Copyright Act of 1790. The Copyright Act has been updated several times, including, notably, the Copyright Act of 1976 and the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998 (also called the \"Mickey Mouse Protection Act\", because it prevented the copyright from expiring on the first commercial success of the cartoon character Mickey Mouse).\n\nThe goal of copyright law, as set forth in the Copyright Clause of the US Constitution, is \"to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.\" This includes incentivizing the creation of art, literature, architecture, music, and other works of authorship. As with many legal doctrines, the effectiveness of copyright law in achieving its stated purpose is a matter of debate.\n\nThe United States copyright law protects \"original works of authorship,\" fixed in a tangible medium including literary, dramatic, musical, artistic, and other intellectual works. This protection is available to both published and unpublished works. Copyright law includes the following types of works:\n\nCopyright law protects the \"expression\" of an idea, but copyright does not protect the \"idea\" itself. This distinction is called the idea–expression dichotomy. The distinction between \"idea\" and \"expression\" is fundamental to copyright law. From the Copyright Act of 1976 ():\nFor example, a paper describing a political theory is copyrightable. The paper is the \"expression\" of the author's ideas about the political theory. But the theory itself is just an \"idea\", and is not copyrightable. Another author is free to describe the same theory in their own words without infringing on the original author's copyright.\n\nAlthough fundamental, the idea–expression dichotomy is often difficult to put into practice. Reasonable people can disagree about where the unprotectable \"idea\" ends and the protectable \"expression\" begins. As Judge Learned Hand put it, \"Obviously, no principle can be stated as to when an imitator has gone beyond copying the 'idea,' and has borrowed its 'expression.' Decisions must therefore inevitably be ad hoc.\"\n\nMere facts are not copyrightable. However, \"compilations of facts\" are treated differently, and may be copyrightable material. The Copyright Act, , allows copyright protection for \"compilations\", as long as there is some \"creative\" or \"original\" act involved in developing the compilation, such as in the selection (deciding which facts to include or exclude), and arrangement (how facts are displayed and in what order). Copyright protection in compilations is limited to the \"selection and arrangement of facts\", not to the facts themselves.\n\nThe Supreme Court decision in \"Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co.\" clarified the requirements for copyright in compilations. The Feist case denied copyright protection to a \"white pages\" phone book (a compilation of telephone numbers, listed alphabetically). In making this ruling, the Supreme Court rejected the \"sweat of the brow\" doctrine. That is, copyright protection requires creativity, and no amount of hard work (\"sweat of the brow\") can transform a non-creative list (like an alphabetical listing of phone numbers) into copyrightable subject matter. A mechanical, non-selective collection of facts (e.g., alphabetized phone numbers) cannot be protected by copyright.\n\nCopyright protects artistic expression. Copyright does not protect useful articles, or objects with some useful functionality. The Copyright Act states:\n\nHowever, many industrial designers create works that are both artistic and functional. Under these circumstances, Copyright Law only protects the artistic expression of such a work, and only to the extent that the artistic expression can be separated from its utilitarian function.\n\nIn 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari in the case \"Star Athletica, L. L. C. v. Varsity Brands, Inc.\" to determine when a \"pictorial, graphic, or sculptural feature\" incorporated into a useful article is eligible for copyright protection, holding that such features are eligible for copyright protection \"only if the feature (1) can be perceived as a two- or three-dimensional work of art separate from the useful article and (2) would qualify as a protectable pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work—either on its own or fixed in some other tangible medium of expression—if it were imagined separately from the useful article into which it is incorporated.\" \"Star Athletica\" began as a suit by Varsity Brands against Star Athletica for infringing the copyright of five cheerleader uniform designs. Applying its new test to the cheerleader uniform designs, the court said:\nThis produces a relatively low threshold for pictorial, graphic, or sculptural features on useful articles to be eligible for copyright protection, which one commentator clearly highlighted: the \"Star Athletica\" decision \"really has ensured that all but the subtlest graphic designs will be able to gain copyright protection...once we determine that the designs 'hav[e] … graphic … qualities … [and could be] applied … on a painter’s canvas,' the test for copyrightability is met.\"\n\nWorks created by the federal government are not copyrightable. . This restriction on copyright applies to publications produced by the United States Government, and its agents or employees within the scope of their employment. The specific language is as follows:\n\nA \"work of the United States Government\" is defined in as work prepared by an officer or employee of the United States Government as part of that person's official duties. Note that government contractors are generally not considered employees, and their works may be subject to copyright. Likewise, the US government can purchase and hold the copyright to works created by third parties.\n\nThe government may restrict access to works it has produced through other mechanisms. For instance, confidential or secret materials are not protected by copyright, but are restricted by other applicable laws. However, even in case of non-secret materials there are specific prohibitions against automatic access to work otherwise covered under for commercial purposes.\n\nFederal statutes are in the public domain and no copyright attaches to them. The same is true of court decisions. It is not difficult to see the motivations behind this:\n\nHowever, several states, such as Oregon and Georgia, have claimed that the annotated editions of their laws are copyrightable. In July 2015, Georgia sued open information activist Carl Malamud, founder of Public.Resource.Org, in Federal court in Atlanta for copyright infringement. Malamud had posted the Official Code of Georgia Annotated on his website. In the complaint and in press releases, the State of Georgia claimed that this constituted “piracy” and “terrorism.”\n\nThere are six basic rights protected by copyright. The owner of copyright has the exclusive right to do and to authorize others to do the following:\n\nA violation of any of the exclusive rights of the copyright holder is a copyright infringement, unless fair use (or a similar affirmative defense) applies.\n\nThe initial owner of the copyright to a work is the author, unless that work is a \"work made for hire.\"\n\n\nIf a work is not a work for hire, then the author will be the initial copyright owner. The author generally is the person who conceives of the copyrightable expression and \"fixes\" it in a \"tangible medium of expression.\" Special rules apply when multiple authors are involved:\n\n\nThree types of transfers exist for copyrighted works.\n\nThe first two, assignment and exclusive licenses, require the transfer to be in writing. Nonexclusive licenses need not be in writing and they may be implied by the circumstances. Transfers of copyright always involve one or more of the \"exclusive rights\" of copyright. For instance, a license may provide a right to perform a work, but not to reproduce it or to prepare a derivative work (adaptation right).\n\nThe terms of the license is governed by the applicable contract law, however there is substantial academic debate about to what extent the Copyright Act preempts state contract law principles.\n\nAn author, after transferring a copyright, can terminate the transfer under certain circumstances. This right to terminate the transfer is absolute and cannot be waived.\n\nCopyright is automatically granted to the author of an original work (that otherwise meets the basic copyright requirements, discussed above). Registration is not necessary. However, registration amplifies a copyright holder's rights in a number of ways. Registration is required before a lawsuit can be filed, and registration creates the possibility for enhanced \"statutory\" damages.\n\nA copyright can be registered online at the US Copyright Office's website. The Copyright Office reviews applications for obvious errors or lack of copyrightable subject matter, and then issues a certificate of registration. The Copyright Office does not compare the authors new work against a collection of existing works or otherwise check for infringement.\n\nThe United States Copyright Office requires a deposit copy of the work for which copyright registration is sought. Deposits can be made through the Copyright Office's eCO System. This deposit requirement serves two purposes. First, if a copyright infringement lawsuit arises, the owner may prove that the material that is infringed is exactly the same material for which the owner has secured a registration. Second, this requirement helps the Library of Congress build its collection of works.\n\nFailure to comply with the deposit requirement, as modified by Copyright Office regulations, is punishable by fine, but does not result in forfeiture of copyright.\n\nThe use of copyright notices is optional. The Berne Convention, amending US copyright law in 1989, makes copyright automatic. However, the lack of notice of copyright using these marks may have consequences in terms of reduced damages in an infringement lawsuit—using notices of this form may reduce the likelihood of a defense of \"innocent infringement\" being successful.\n\nCopyright protection generally lasts for 70 years after the death of the author. If the work was a \"work for hire\", then copyright persists for 120 years after creation or 95 years after publication, whichever is shorter. For works created before 1978, the copyright duration rules are complicated. However, works created before 1923 have made their way into the public domain.\n\nFor works published or registered before 1978, the maximum copyright duration is 95 years from the date of publication, if copyright was renewed during the 28th year following publication. Copyright renewal has been automatic since the Copyright Renewal Act of 1992.\n\nFor works created before 1978, but not published or registered before 1978, the standard §302 copyright duration also applies. Prior to 1978, works had to be published or registered to receive copyright protection. Upon the effective date of the 1976 Copyright Act (which was January 1, 1978) this requirement was removed and these unpublished, unregistered works received protection. However, Congress intended to provide an incentive for these authors to publish their unpublished works. To provide that incentive, these works, if published before 2003, would not have their protection expire before 2048.\n\nAll copyrightable works published in the United States before 1923 are in the public domain; works created before 1978 but not published until recently may be protected until 2047. For works that received their copyright before 1978, a renewal had to be filed in the work's 28th year with the Copyright Office for its term of protection to be extended. The need for renewal was eliminated by the Copyright Renewal Act of 1992, but works that had already entered the public domain by non-renewal did not regain copyright protection. Therefore, works published before 1964 that were not renewed are in the public domain.\n\nBefore 1972, sound recordings were not subject to federal copyright, but copying was nonetheless regulated under various state torts and statutes, some of which had no duration limit. The Sound Recording Amendment of 1971 extended federal copyright to recordings fixed on or after February 15, 1972, and declared that recordings fixed before that date would remain subject to state or common law copyright. Subsequent amendments had extended this latter provision until 2067. As a result, older sound recordings were not subject to the expiration rules that applied to contemporary visual works. Although these could have entered the public domain as a result of government authorship or formal grant by the owner, the practical effect has been to render public domain audio virtually nonexistent.\n\nThis situation has changed with the 2018 enactment of the Music Modernization Act, which extended federal copyright protection to all sound recordings, regardless of their date of creation, and preempted state copyright laws on those works. Under the Act, the first sound recordings to enter the public domain will be those fixed before 1923, which will enter the public domain on January 1, 2022. Recordings fixed between 1923 and February 14, 1972 will be phased into the public domain in the following decades.\n\nIn May 2016, Judge Percy Anderson ruled in a lawsuit between ABS Entertainment and CBS Radio that \"remastered\" versions of pre-1972 recordings can receive a federal copyright as a distinct work due to the amount of creative effort expressed in the process.\n\nUnited States copyright law includes numerous defenses, exceptions, and limitations. Some of the most important include:\n\n\n\nFair use is the use of limited amounts of copyrighted material in such a way as to not be an infringement. It is codified at , and states that \"the fair use of a copyrighted work ... is not an infringement of copyright.\" The section lists four factors that must be assessed to determine whether a particular use is fair. There are no bright-line rules regarding fair use and each determination is made on an individualized case-by-case basis.\n\nIn addition to these four factors, the statute also allows courts to consider any other factors that may be relevant to the fair use analysis. Courts evaluate fair use claims on a case-by-case basis, and the outcome of any given case depends on the specific facts of that case. There is \"no formula\" to ensure that a predetermined percentage or amount of a work—or specific number of words, lines, pages, copies—may be used without permission.\n\nThe justification of the fair use doctrine turns primarily on whether, and to what extent, the challenged use is \"transformative\". \"The use must be productive and must employ the quoted matter in a different manner or for a different purpose from the original. A quotation of copyrighted material that merely repackages or republishes the original is unlikely to pass the test... If, on the other hand, the secondary use adds value to the original--if the quoted matter is used as raw material, transformed in the creation of new information, new aesthetics, new insights and understandings-- this is the very type of activity that the fair use doctrine intends to protect for the enrichment of society.\"\n\nThe Copyright Office provides a searchable list of fair use case law.\n\nAlthough a parody can be considered a derivative work, and thus within the exclusive rights of the copyright owner, it may qualify as \"fair use.\" Parodies are not automatically fair use. The Supreme Court of the United States stated that parody (transformative) \"is the use of some elements of a prior author's composition to create a new one that, at least in part, comments on that author's works.\" That commentary function provides some justification for use of the older work; in contrast, a satire (exaggerated) (which is not targeted at the work borrowed from) does not require use of the original work to make its point. (See \"Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.\").\n\nCopyright infringement occurs when someone violates one of the exclusive rights listed in 17 USC 106. Commonly, this involves someone creating or distributing a \"copy\" of a protected work that is \"substantially similar\" to the original version.\n\nInfringement requires copying. If two people happen to write exactly the same story, without knowledge of the other, there is no infringement.\n\nA copyright owner may bring a copyright infringement lawsuit in federal court. Federal courts have \"exclusive\" subject-matter jurisdiction over copyright infringement cases. That is, an infringement case may not be brought in \"state\" courts. Note that the Copyright Office handles copyright registrations, but it does not adjudicate copyright infringement disputes.\n\nTo bring a copyright infringement lawsuit, a copyright holder must establish ownership of a valid copyright and the copying of constituent elements of the work that are original. The copyright owner must also establish both (a) actual copying and (b) improper appropriation of the work. The copyright owner, as plaintiff, bears the burden of establishing these three elements of the \"prima facie\" case for infringement.\n\nA plaintiff establishes ownership by authorship (by the plaintiff itself or by someone who assigned rights to the plaintiff) of (1) an \"original\" work of authorship that is (2) fixed in a tangible medium (e.g. a book, musical recording, etc.).\n\nRegistration is not required to establish copyright protection, but registration is necessary before bringing a lawsuit. Registration is also useful because it creates a presumption of a \"valid\" copyright, it allows the plaintiff to collect enhanced \"statutory damages\", and to be eligible for an award of attorney fees.\n\nA plaintiff establishes \"actual copying\" with direct or indirect evidence. Direct evidence is satisfied either by a defendant's admission to copying or the testimony of witnesses who observed the defendant in the act. More commonly, a plaintiff relies on circumstantial or indirect evidence. A court will infer copying by a showing of a \"striking similarity\" between the copyrighted work and the alleged copy, along with a showing of both access and use of that access. A plaintiff may establish \"access\" by proof of distribution over a large geographical area, or by eyewitness testimony that the defendant owned a copy of the protected work. Access alone is not sufficient to establish infringement. The plaintiff must show a similarity between the two works, and the degree of similarity will affect the probability that illicit copying in fact occurred in the court's eyes. Even then, the plaintiff must show that the copying amounted to improper appropriation. Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has held that not all copying constitutes infringement and a showing of misappropriation is necessary.\n\nA copyrighted work may contain elements which are not copyrightable, such as facts, ideas, themes, or content in the public domain. A plaintiff alleging misappropriation must first demonstrate that what the defendant appropriated from the copyrighted work was protectible. Second, a plaintiff must show that the intended audience will recognize substantial similarities between the two works. The intended audience may be the general public, or a specialized field. The degree of similarity necessary for a court to find misappropriation is not easily defined. Indeed, \"the test for infringement of a copyright is of necessity vague.\"\n\nTwo methods are used to determine if unlawful appropriation has occurred: the \"subtractive method\" and the \"totality method\".\n\nThe subtractive method, also known as the \"abstraction/subtraction approach\" seeks to analyze what parts of a copyrighted work are protectible and which are not. The unprotected elements are \"subtracted\" and the fact finder then determines whether substantial similarities exist in the protectible expression which remains. For instance, if the copyright holder for \"West Side Story\" alleged infringement, the elements of that musical borrowed from \"Romeo and Juliet\" would be subtracted before comparing it to the allegedly infringing work because \"Romeo and Juliet\" exists in the public domain.\n\nThe totality method, also known as the \"total concept and feel\" approach takes the work as a whole with all elements included when determining if a substantial similarity exists.\nThis was first formulated in \"Roth Greeting Cards v. United Card Co.\" (1970). \nThe individual elements of the alleged infringing work may by themselves be substantially different from their corresponding part in the copyrighted work, but nevertheless taken together be a clear misappropriation of copyrightable material.\n\nModern courts may sometimes use both methods in its analysis of misappropriation. In other instances, one method may find misappropriation while the other would not, making misappropriation a contentious topic in infringement litigation.\n\nA successful copyright infringement plaintiff may seek both \"injunctive relief\" and monetary damages.\n\nInjunctions: Copyright Act § 502 authorizes courts to grant both preliminary and permanent injunctions against copyright infringement. There are also provisions for impounding allegedly infringing copies and other materials used to infringe, and for their destruction.\n\nDamages and/or Profits: Copyright Act § 504 gives the copyright owner a choice of recovering: (1) their actual damages and any additional profits of the defendant; or (2) statutory damages.\n\nBoth temporary and permanent injunctions are available to prevent or restrain infringement of a copyright. An \"injunction\" is a court order directing the defendant to stop doing something (e.g., stop selling infringing copies). One form of equitable relief that is available in copyright cases is a seizure order. At any time during the lawsuit, the court may order the impoundment of any and all copies of the infringing products. The seizure order may include materials used to produce such copies, such as master tapes, film negatives, printing plates, etc. Items that are impounded during the course of the lawsuit can, if the plaintiff wins, be ordered destroyed as part of the final decree.\n\nA copyright holder can also seek monetary damages. Injunctions and damages are not mutually exclusive. One can have injunctions and no damages, or damages and no injunctions, or both injunctions and damages. There are two types of damages: actual damages and profits, or statutory damages.\n\nThe copyright owner may recover the profits he or she would have earned absent the infringement (actual damages) and any profits the infringer might have made as a result of the infringement but that are not already considered in calculating actual damages. To recover actual damages, the plaintiff must prove to the court that, in the absence of the infringement, the plaintiff would have been able to make additional sales, or perhaps been able to charge higher prices, and that this would have resulted in profits given the owner's cost structure. In some cases, the profits earned by the infringer exploiting the copyrighted material may exceed those earned by or potentially available to the owner. In these circumstances, the copyright owner can recover the infringer's profits if he or she can demonstrate a nexus between the profits and the infringing use.\n\nStatutory damages are available as an alternative to actual damages and profits. If the copyright was registered either (a) within three months of publication or (b) before the infringement, then the plaintiff is eligible to seek statutory damages. Statutory damages can be awarded by the court within the range of $750 to $30,000, but this can be lowered if the infringement is deemed inadvertent, or increased significantly if the infringement is willful.\n\nStatutory damages are sometimes preferable for the plaintiff if actual damages and profits are either too small, or too difficult to prove, or both. There are, however, situations where statutory damages are not available. provides:\nStatutory damages are calculated per work infringed. According to clause (1) of Title 17, U.S.C. Section 504(c), statutory damages range from $750 per work to $30,000 per work, with two principal exceptions:\n\nDamages in copyright cases can be very high. In \"Lowry's Reports, Inc. v. Legg Mason Inc.\", a 2003 lawsuit between a publisher of stock analysis newsletters against a company that buys one copy of the newsletters and makes multiple copies for use in-house, the jury awarded damages – actual damages for some newsletters and statutory damages for other newsletters – totaling $20 million.\n\nCost and attorney fees: Copyright Act § 505 permits courts, in their discretion, to award costs against either party and to award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party. The court may (but is not required to) award to the \"prevailing party\" reasonable attorney's fees. This applies to both a winning plaintiff (copyright owner) and a winning defendant (accused infringer). However, attorney's fees award is not available against the government. Like statutory damages, attorney's fees are not available if the work infringed is not registered at the time of infringement.\n\nIn addition to the civil remedies, the Copyright Act provides for criminal prosecution in some cases of willful copyright infringement. There are also criminal sanctions for fraudulent copyright notice, fraudulent removal of copyright notice, and false representations in applications for copyright registration. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act imposes criminal sanctions for certain acts of circumvention and interference with copyright management information. There are not criminal sanctions for violating the rights of attribution and integrity held by the author of a work of visual art.\n\nCriminal penalties for copyright infringement include:\nNonprofit libraries, archives, education institutions and public broadcasting entities are exempt from criminal prosecution.\n\nFelony penalties for first offenses begin at seven copies for audiovisual works, and one hundred copies for sound recordings.\n\nThe U.S. government, its agencies and officials, and corporations owned or controlled by it, are subject to suit for copyright infringement. All infringement claims against the U.S. that did not arise in a foreign country must be filed with the United States Court of Federal Claims within three years of the infringing action. Claims filed in the wrong court are dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The government and its agencies are also authorized to settle the infringement claims out of court.\n\nWorks in the public domain are free for anyone to copy and use. Strictly speaking, the term \"public domain\" means that the work is not covered by any intellectual property rights at all (copyright, trademark, patent, or otherwise). However, this article discusses public domain with respect to copyright \"only\".\n\nA work may enter the public domain in a number of different ways. For example, (a) the copyright protecting the work may have expired, or (b) the owner may have explicitly donated the work to the public, or (c) the work is not the type of work that copyright can protect.\n\nThe \"orphan works\" problem arose in the United States with the enactment of the Copyright Act of 1976, which eliminated the need to register copyrighted works, instead declaring that all \"original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression\" fall into copyright status. The elimination of registration also eliminated a central recording location to track and identify copyright-holders. Consequently, potential users of copyrighted works, e.g., filmmakers or biographers, must assume that many works they might use are copyrighted. Where the planned use would not be otherwise permitted by law (for example, by fair use), they must themselves individually investigate the copyright status of each work they plan to use. With no central database of copyright-holders, identifying and contacting copyright-holders can sometimes be difficult; those works that fall into this category may be considered \"orphaned\".\n\nFixation\n\nOriginality\n\nIdea/expression dichotomy\n\nFair use\n\n\n\n"}

Along with the Conference on Critical Legal Studies in America, and Critique du Droit in France it contributed to the formation of critical legal theory as a movement and field. The conference is based in the UK but it has also been held in India, Finland and Ireland. It is associated with the critical legal studies (CLS) movement and loosely associated with the journal Law & Critique.\n\nDespite the putative association with American CLS, Costas Douzinas, who has been closely involved with the British CLC from its outset, has argued that their ethos are very different. American CLS was intellectually focused on the \"critique of the judicial institutions and reasoning\" while its politics \"were largely exhausted in the intrigue of the academy and the endless search for media exposure\". If, on the one hand, American CLS was a \"political movement with little politics\",\n\n[t]he British Critical Legal Conference (CLC), on the other hand, is an intellectual movement with lots of politics. The annual CLC started in 1984 and has taken place without interruption ever since. In all these years of operation no officers or posts, chairmen and secretaries, committees or delegates were created. There is no organization. The conference was and remains just that: a conference and an umbrella name. We could call the CLC ‘a community always to come’, a broad church that exists for three days once every year in its gathering and ceases existing once it is over. Every September the place for the next conference is decided and people bid their good-byes for another year, leaving it to the next organiser to put together the programme. No honour, power or position attaches to the conference, no promotion preferment or move to better posts follows organisation or participation. There is only an annual conference and people who turn out every year because they love ideas and they are concerned about the role of law in society and their own role within the institution. Over the years, these conferences introduced themes, schools of thought and movements unknown or dismissed by legal scholarship. Western marxism, postmodernism and deconstruction were the main theoretical influences of the early conferences but soon the new radicalism of race, gender, queer and post-colonial theory were introduced in the legal academy through the CLC. Indeed these conferences were the only academic venues in which such themes were discussed for many years before they became respectable and entered, albeit marginally, mainstream academia.\n\nThe Critical Legal Conference was established in 1984 and its first annual meeting was held at the University of Kent in 1986. Alan Hunt was the founding chair of the Critical Legal Conference.\n\n\n"}

There have been no declarations of war since the Second World War, though British Armed Forces have taken part in armed conflict on numerous occasions nonetheless.\n\nThere has been a long-running debate regarding whether Parliament alone should have the power to declare war and more widely to commit British forces to armed conflict. This was attempted (to the limited extent of possible war against Iraq) in 1999 with the introduction of the Military Action Against Iraq (Parliamentary Approval) Bill. However Queen Elizabeth II, acting upon the advice of her government at the time, refused to grant her consent to allow the bill to be debated in Parliament and so it was dropped (Queen's Consent was needed before debate could take place because the bill affected the royal prerogative).

{"id": "5738235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5738235", "title": "Domain name warehousing", "text": "Domain name warehousing\n\nDomain name warehousing is the practice of registrars obtaining control of expired domain names already under their management, with the intent to hold or “warehouse” names for their own use and/or profit.\n\nTypically this practice occurs after a domain name has expired and the previous (registrant) has not exercised his or her right to renew the name within the allotted time frame; usually 45 days following expiration. A domain's expiration date and time can be calculated based on the expiration date in the WHOIS, Auto-Renew Grace Period (0–45 days) and the Redemption Grace Period (RDP) of the registry managing the domain registration (30 days).\n\nAccording to the Generic Names Supporting Organization Council (GNSO) Deletes Task Force Report (2003), a council organized under the Internet Corporation For Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), three specific modes of warehousing have been identified:\n\n\nThe Registrars Accreditation Agreement (RAA) currently does not disallow this practice. However, the ICANN community has open calls for policy changes to limit warehousing, as it is perceived as unfair to potential registrants.\n\nThe primary concern today with the practice of domain warehousing is that retail registrars, which have historically focused on serving individual and small business registrants, are now actively collecting lapsed domain names and offering drop catch services that conflict with the concept of fair access to domain names. An additional concern is that companies pooling scores of drop registrars for additional registry connections will stand at the expiring domain spigot conducting domain tasting without paying, and then warehouse those that meet traffic criteria while denying the broader community a fair opportunity to compete for those expiring names.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2008, GoDaddy had a subsidiary Standard Tactics, which held domains previously owned by GoDaddy. Shortly after this was reported on, GoDaddy closed down Standard Tactics. However, today, GoDaddy openly practices domain warehousing. Instead of letting domains which GoDaddy considers \"Premium domains\" expire, GoDaddy takes control of and lists as \"Premium Domains\" those domains, after the registrant - GoDaddy's customer - allows them to lapse, even before the end of the redemption period. These domains are often listed at GoDaddy auctions for thousands of dollars, as \"Premium domains\". GoDaddy sells these domains at auction while the original registrant is still entitled to redemption of the domain, with the stipulation that if the original registrant uses their right to redeem the domain and renews it within the redemption period, GoDaddy simply refunds the money paid by the winning bidder.\n\nICANN has not yet amended the RAA with policies to limit domain warehousing and related practices. Registrars are in a unique position to impact domain name pricing by introducing competitive bidding or auctions for expired domain names. Fair access to domain names is further impacted when registrars opt not to market the warehoused domains immediately, delaying the recycling of warehoused names indefinitely.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1717499", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1717499", "title": "Duty of care", "text": "Duty of care\n\nIn tort law, a duty of care is a legal obligation which is imposed on an individual requiring adherence to a standard of reasonable care while performing any acts that could foreseeably harm others. It is the first element that must be established to proceed with an action in negligence. The claimant must be able to show a duty of care imposed by law which the defendant has breached. In turn, breaching a duty may subject an individual to liability. The duty of care may be imposed \"by operation of law\" between individuals with no \"current\" direct relationship (familial or contractual or otherwise), but eventually become related in some manner, as defined by common law (meaning case law).\n\nDuty of care may be considered a formalisation of the social contract, the implicit responsibilities held by individuals towards others within society. It is not a requirement that a duty of care be defined by law, though it will often develop through the jurisprudence of common law.\n\nAt common law, duties were formerly limited to those with whom one was in privity one way or another, as exemplified by cases like \"Winterbottom v. Wright\" (1842). In the early 20th century, judges began to recognize that the cold realities of the Second Industrial Revolution (in which end users were frequently several parties removed from the original manufacturer) implied that enforcing the privity requirement against hapless consumers had harsh results in many product liability cases. The idea of a general duty of care that runs to all who could be foreseeably affected by one's conduct (accompanied by the demolishing of the privity barrier) first appeared in the judgment of William Brett (later Lord Esher), Master of the Rolls, in \"Heaven v Pender\" (1883). Although Brett's formulation was rejected by the rest of the court, similar formulations later appeared in the landmark U.S. case of \"MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.\" (1916) and, in the UK, in \"Donoghue v Stevenson\" (1932). Both \"MacPherson\" and \"Donoghue\" were product liability cases, and both expressly acknowledged and cited Brett's analysis as their inspiration.\n\nAlthough the duty of care is easiest to understand in contexts like simple blunt trauma, it is important to understand that the duty can be still found in situations where plaintiffs and defendants may be separated by vast distances of space and time.\n\nFor instance, an engineer or construction company involved in erecting a building may be reasonably responsible to tenants inhabiting the building many years in the future. This point is illustrated by the decision of the South Carolina Supreme Court in \"Terlinde v. Neely\" 275 S.C. 395, 271 S.E.2d 768 (1980), later cited by the Supreme Court of Canada in \"Winnipeg Condominium Corporation No. 36 v. Bird Construction Co.\" [1995] 1 S.C.R. 85:\nAlthough the idea of a general duty of care is now widely accepted, there are significant differences among the common law jurisdictions concerning the specific circumstances under which that duty of care exists. Obviously, courts cannot impose unlimited liability and hold everyone liable for everyone else's problems; as Justice Cardozo put it, to rule otherwise would be to expose defendants \"to a liability in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class.\" There must be some reasonable limit to the duty of care; the problem is where to set that limit.\n\nThe question whether a duty of care exists depends firstly on whether there is an analogous case in which the Courts have previously held there to exist (or not exist) a duty of care; and, if there is no analogous case, what the particular court deciding the case at issue itself thinks about whether a duty of care exists. Situations in which a duty of care have previously been held to exist include doctor and patient, manufacturer and consumer , and surveyor and mortgagor .\n\nAccordingly, if there is an analogous case on duty of care, the court will simply apply that case to the facts of the new case without asking itself any normative question . It is only if there is no similar case that the court will then go onto apply the normative criteria which Lord Bridge of Harwich sets out in \"Caparo Industries plc v Dickman\", in which the House of Lords set out the following three-part test:\n\n\nThe High Court of Australia has deviated from the British approach, which still recognises a proximity element. Rather, Australian law first determines whether the case at hand fits within an established category of case where a duty of care has been found. For example, occupiers of a premises automatically owe a duty of care to any person on their premises.\n\nIf this is not the case, then the plaintiff must prove that it was reasonably foreseeable that harm could result from the defendant's actions. If so, the Court then applies a 'salient features' test to determine whether the plaintiff is owed a duty of care. Some of the salient features which the Court considers in making this inquiry include:\nSpecial rules exist for the establishment of duty of care where the plaintiff suffered mental harm, or where the defendant is a public authority. \n\nTo establish a duty of care, the plaintiff has to satisfy the requirement of CLA Act ss 27-33. In light of this, a large number of individuals cannot claim injuries as well. Meanwhile, compared to the ‘No-Fault Compensation’ system in New Zealand, the cost to claim injuries is much higher. In light of this, individuals especially the victims who lack knowledge or capability may choose not claim private nuisance after balancing the burden and outcomes. This view affirmed by Regina Graycar, he states that the courts in Australia are reluctant to award damages for personal injuries.\n\nIn New South Wales, a plaintiff is able to recover for non-economic loss, including pain and suffering, loss of amenities/expectation of life and disfigurement, upon the severity of the loss being at least 15% of 'most extreme case'.\nAs of October 2016, NSW Attorney General, Gabrielle Upton, has updated the maximum amount of damages for non-economic loss from $594,000 to $605,000.\n\nOn 27 March 2017, the French National Assembly adopted a law entitled “Devoir de vigilance des entreprises donneuses d'ordre”, whose title has been translated into English as a \"duty of vigilance\" or \"duty of care\".\n\nThe law will oblige large French companies (companies with at least 5,000 staff in France or 10,000 staff within their combined French and foreign offices over two consecutive years) to:\n\nBecause each of the 50 U.S. states is a separate sovereign free to develop its own tort law under the Tenth Amendment, there are several tests for finding a duty of care in United States tort law.\n\nIn several states, like Florida and Massachusetts, the sole test is whether the harm to the plaintiff from the defendant's actions was foreseeable.\n\nThe Supreme Court of California, in a majority opinion by Justice David Eagleson, criticized the idea that foreseeability, standing alone, constitutes an adequate basis on which to rest the duty of care: \"Experience has shown that . . . there are clear judicial days on which a court can foresee forever and thus determine liability but none on which that foresight alone provides a socially and judicially acceptable limit on recovery of damages.\"\n\nDrawing upon the work of scholars such as Fowler V. Harper, Fleming James Jr., and William Prosser, California has developed a complicated balancing test consisting of multiple factors which must be carefully weighed against one another to determine whether a duty of care exists in a negligence action.\n\nCalifornia Civil Code section 1714 imposes a general duty of ordinary care, which by default requires all persons to take reasonable measures to prevent harm to others.\nIn the 1968 case of \"Rowland v. Christian\", the court held that judicial exceptions to this general duty of care should only be created if clearly justified based on the following public-policy factors:\n\nA 1997 case added to this:\n\n\nContemporary California appellate decisions treat the \"Rowland\" decision as the \"gold standard\" for determining the existence of a legal duty of care, and generally refer to the criteria for determining the existence of a legal duty of care as the \"Rowland\" factors.\n\nIn California, the duty inquiry focuses on the general category of conduct at issue and the range of foreseeable harm it creates, rather than the specific actions or injuries in each case. Appellate lawyer Jeffrey Ehrlich persuaded the California Supreme Court to clarify the central importance of this distinction with its 2011 decision in \"Cabral v. Ralphs Grocery Co\". which requires \"no duty\" rulings to be based on categorical public-policy rules that can be applied to a range of cases, without reference to detailed facts. By requiring courts to apply the \"Rowland\" factors at this high level of factual generality, the \"Cabral\" decision preserved the role of juries in determining whether the defendant breached its duty of care based on the unique circumstances of each case.\n\nA majority of U.S. states have adopted some kind of multi-factor analysis based on the work of Prosser and others. Some states simply copied California's factors but modified them, like Michigan (which deleted the insurance factor and never picked up the social utility factor), while others developed different lists of factors, such as this one from Tennessee:\n\n\nA 2011 law review article identified 43 states that use a multifactor analysis in 23 various incarnations; consolidating them together results in a list of 42 different factors used by U.S. courts to determine whether a duty of care exists.\n\nThe Tennessee Court of Appeal has also recently followed the California Supreme Court's lead by citing \"Cabral\" for the proposition that duty determinations must be made at the highest level of factual generality.\n\nOnce a duty exists, the plaintiff must show that the defendant \"breached\" it. This is generally treated as the second element of negligence in the United States. Breach involves testing the defendant's actions against the standard of a \"reasonable person\", which varies depending on the facts of the case. For example, physicians will be held to reasonable standards for members of their profession, rather than those of the general public, in negligence actions for medical malpractice.\n\nIn turn, once the appropriate standard has been found, the \"breach\" is proven when the plaintiff shows that the defendant's conduct fell below or did not reach the relevant standard of reasonable care.\n\nHowever, it is possible that the defendant took every possible precaution and \"exceeded\" what would have been done by any reasonable person, yet the plaintiff was injured. If that is the case, then as a matter of law, the duty of care has not been breached and the plaintiff cannot recover in negligence. This is the key difference between negligence and strict liability; if strict liability attaches to the defendant's conduct, then the plaintiff can recover under that theory regardless of whatever precautions were taken by the defendant.\n\nProduct liability was the context in which the general duty of care first developed. Manufacturers owe a duty of care to consumers who ultimately purchase and use the products. In the case of \"Donoghue v Stevenson\" [1932] AC 562 of the House of Lords, Lord Atkin stated:\n\nAt common law, in the case of landowners, the extent of their duty of care to those who came on their premises varied depending on whether a person was classified as a trespasser, licensee, or invitee. This rule was eventually abolished in some common law jurisdictions. For example, England enacted the Occupiers Liability Act 1957. Similarly, in the 1968 landmark case of \"Rowland v. Christian\", the Supreme Court of California replaced the old classifications with a general duty of care to \"all\" persons on one's land, regardless of their status. After several highly publicized and controversial cases, the California Legislature enacted a statute in 1985 that partially restored immunity to landowners from some types of lawsuits from trespassers.\n\nColorado's highest court adopted the \"Rowland\" unified duty of care analysis in 1971. The resulting explosion of lawsuits against Colorado landowners caused the state legislature to enact the Colorado Premises Liability Act in 1986, which enacted a cleaned-up statutory version of the common law classifications \"and\" simultaneously expressly displaced all common law remedies against landowners in order to prevent state courts from again expanding their liability.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, under the Occupiers' Liability Act, 1995, the duty of care to trespassers, visitors and \"recreational users\" can be restricted by the occupier; provided reasonable notice is given, for which a prominent notice at the usual entrance to the premises usually suffices.\n\nIn business, \"the duty of care addresses the attentiveness and prudence of managers in performing their decision-making and supervisory functions.\" The \"business judgment rule presumes that directors (and officers) carry out their functions in good faith, after sufficient investigation, and for acceptable reasons. Unless this presumption is overcome, courts abstain from second-guessing well-meaning business decisions even when they are flops. This is a risk that shareholders take when they make a corporate investment.\"\n\nThe Duty of Care Risk Analysis Standard (DoCRA) provides principles and practices for evaluating risk. It considers all parties that could be affected by those risks. DoCRA evaluates safeguards if they are appropriate in protecting others from harm while presenting a reasonable burden. \n"}

Works such as James Love's \"Cricket: an heroic poem\" and Mary Mitford's \"our Village,\" along with Nyren's \"cricketers of my Time\" and Pycroft's \"The Cricket Field,\" purported to identify the characteristics of cricket with the notional characteristics of English society, such as pragmatism, integrity, and independence.\n\n\n\n"}

In US law, these rights belong to the holder of the copyright, who may sell (or \"option\") them to someone in the film industry—usually a producer or director, or sometimes a specialist broker of such properties—who will then try to gather industry professionals and secure the financial backing necessary to convert the property into a film. Such rights differ from the right to commercially exhibit a finished motion picture, which rights are usually referred to as \"exhibition rights\" or \"public-performance rights\".\n\nIn the United States, the need to secure film rights of previously published or produced source materials still under copyright stems from case law. In 1907, the Kalem Company produced a one-reel silent film version of General Lew Wallace's novel \"\" without first securing film rights. Wallace's estate and his American publisher, Harper & Brothers sued for copyright infringement. The United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, establishing the precedent that all adaptations are subject to copyright.\n\nWhen producers option a script, they are purchasing the right to buy certain rights to intellectual property. A general option fee is 10% of the cost of the rights, should the producers manage to secure full financing for their project and have it \"greenlit\". Because few projects actually manage to be greenlit, options allow producers to reduce their loss in the event that a project fails to come to fruition. Should the project be greenlit, an option provides a legally binding guarantee to purchase the film rights.\n\nThe contract for an option will specify the length of time it is valid for. If the producer is unable to have their project greenlit within the specified timeframe (e.g. two years), the option will expire. The rights holder can then put the previously optioned rights up for sale again. Or, the contract may allow the producer to renew the option for a certain price.\n\nAs it is common for scripts to be stuck in development hell, the options for a script may expire and be resold on multiple occasions. As well, producers who purchase an option and rework the script own the rights to their own derivative work- while the original rights holder owns the underlying rights. This lineage is referred to as the chain of title. This lineage can become cloudy if the underlying rights are divided. Producers may purchase the rights to a specific region (i.e. a country, the entire world, or the universe) and/or they may purchase ancillary rights such as merchandising rights.\n\nIn some cases, it may be uncertain as to the exact owners of a particular version of a script and to the exact set of rights. It is important for an entertainment lawyer to determine how 'clean' a chain of title is.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3901931", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3901931", "title": "German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact", "text": "German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact\n\nThe German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact (; ) was an international treaty between Nazi Germany and the Second Polish Republic, signed on January 26, 1934. Both countries pledged to resolve their problems by bilateral negotiations and to forgo armed conflict for a period of ten years. It effectively normalized relations between Poland and Germany, which were previously strained by border disputes arising from the territorial settlement in the Treaty of Versailles. Germany effectively recognized Poland's borders and moved to end an economically damaging customs war between the two countries that had taken place over the previous decade. Before 1933 Poland had worried that some sort of alliance would take place between Germany and the Soviet Union, to the detriment of Poland. Therefore, Poland had a military alliance with France. The Nazis and the Communists were bitter enemies of each other, so when Hitler came to power in 1933 the likelihood of hostile alliance seemed remote.\n\nOne of the most noted of Józef Piłsudski's foreign policies was his rumored proposal to France to declare war on Germany after Adolf Hitler had come to power, in January 1933. Some historians write that Piłsudski may have sounded out France regarding the possibility of joint military action against Germany, which had been openly rearming in violation of the Versailles Treaty. France's refusal might have been one of the reasons that Poland signed the German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact.\n\nHowever, the argument that the German-Polish non-aggression pact had been forced on Piłsudski by French refusal to wage a \"preventive war\" has been disputed by historians, who point out that there is no evidence in French or Polish diplomatic archives that such a proposal was ever advanced. They state that when in late October 1933, rumors of a Polish \"preventive-war\" proposal were reported in Paris, their source was the Polish Embassy, which had informed French reporters that Poland had proposed a \"preventive war\" to France and Belgium, but Poland and Germany had already been secretly negotiating their Pact. It has been argued that Piłsudski had had the Polish Embassy start rumors about a \"preventive war\" to pressure the Germans, who were demanding that Poland abrogate its 1921 Franco-Polish alliance. The Pact would specifically exclude that alliance.\n\nIt has been said that Piłsudski's reason for seeking the Pact with Germany was his concern over France's Maginot Line. Until 1929, French plans had called for a French offensive into the North German Plain, in conjunction with offensives from Poland and Czechoslovakia. The construction of the Maginot Line, which began in 1929, indicated the French Army's preference for a strictly defensive stance, leaving, consequently, its eastern allies on their own. (That is exactly what happened in 1939 with the Phoney War.) From Piłsudski's viewpoint, in light of France's military plans, a non-aggression pact with Germany would be the best choice for Poland.\n\nPiłsudski used Hitler's rise to power and international isolation of Germany's new regime as an opportunity to reduce the risk that Poland would become the first victim of German aggression or of a Great Power deal (especially the Four Power Pact). Germany's new rulers seemed to depart from the traditionally Prussian anti-Polish orientation. Piłsudski regarded the new chancellor as less dangerous than his immediate predecessors, such as Gustav Stresemann, and he saw the Soviet Union as the greater threat and even opposed French and Czechoslovak efforts to include the Soviet Union in a common front against Germany.\n\nThe Poles insisted on stating that it did not nullify any previous international agreements, in particular the Franco-Polish Military Alliance. Nevertheless, by easing Poland's disputes with Germany bilaterally, the treaty weakened France's diplomatic position against Germany.\n\nTo allay any fears of a war against the Soviet Union, on May 5, 1934, Poland renewed the Soviet–Polish Non-Aggression Pact, which had been first signed on July 25, 1932. It was extended until December 31, 1945, ignoring Hitler’s repeated suggestion to form a German-Polish alliance against the Soviets. \n\nPoland was able to maintain friendly relations with Germany for the next five years but also with France and Britain. However, it may have also led to foreign policy inattentiveness regarding the activities of the crumbling League of Nations and ignoring the collective security schemes proposed by French and Czechoslovakia in the early 1930s.\n\nThe Pact, soon followed by a trade agreement with Germany, is said to have granted Germany a settled eastern border and allowed Hitler time for rearmament. Five years later, Germany and the Soviet Union invaded Poland. Piłsudski distrusted German intentions on the whole but perceived Hitler's origins as an Austrian rather than a Prussian as a mitigating factor and stated that Hitler should stay in power as long as possible.\nThe Pact has been seen as an instance of political weakness brought on by Piłsudski's illness, and it was likened to the interwar lack of leadership displayed by Neville Chamberlain and Paul von Hindenburg.\n\nGerman policy changed drastically in late 1938, after the annexation of Sudetenland sealed the fate of Czechoslovakia, and Poland became Hitler's next target. In October 1938, German Foreign Minister Joachim Ribbentrop presented Poland with the proposition of renewing the Pact in exchange for allowing the Free City of Danzig to be annexed by Germany and the construction of an extraterritorial motorway and railway through the Polish Corridor, with Germany accepting Poland's postwar borders. Poland refused. As a consequence, Hitler rescinded the Pact unilaterally on April 28, 1939, during an address before the Reichstag, as Germany renewed its territorial claims in Poland. After another few months of rising tension, and following the execution of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between Germany and the Soviet Union, which contained a secret protocol by which Hitler and Stalin agreed to divide Poland between them, Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, initiating World War II.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "39656600", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39656600", "title": "Human rights literature", "text": "Human rights literature\n\nHuman rights literature is a literary genre that deals with human rights issues, and thus - directly or indirectly - promotes values of human rights. The goal of human rights literature is to combine the literary driving force with the motivation for action, which is a fundamental and integral element of the struggle for protection of human rights. This literary genre is based on the concept of \"Engaged Literature\" that was articulated by the French writer and philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre.\n\nHuman rights literature is committed to society and believes that each one of us has moral duty and power to make a social change. It is based on the belief of the enormous power of literature to make a change, and in the responsibility of the author toward readers both on the social aspect and the artistic one.\n\nThe concept of human rights literature was first articulated in the foreword to \"Freedom\", an anthology of short stories by renowned authors from around the world published in Britain in 2010 by Mainstream Publishing in cooperation with the human rights organization Amnesty International. The stories were written in the spirit of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nThe foreword - \"The Tremendous Power of Literature\", by Vered Cohen Barzilay, discusses the relationship between the Italian novella \"Prima di Lasciarsi\" by Gabriella Ambrosio (English: \"Before We Say Goodbye\") and human rights.\n\nThe foreword along with the book was translated into various languages and published around the world in many countries including UK, US, Canada, Poland, Spain, Latin America, and Italy. At the 2010 Edinburgh Book festival the preliminary concept was first introduced in public discussion, and in March 2012 it was formally introduced by Cohen-Barzilay at Oxford University, UK, at a panel discussion held under the title \"The Power of Literature and Human Rights\" and early 2013 at the Literary Festival at the London School of Economics. In 2012, Cohen-Barzilay founded Novel Rights e-publishing, an e- publishing house specializing in creating and promoting Human Rights Literature.\n\n\"Human rights literature\" is based on the idea of \"engaged literature\" that was first formulated by the French writer and philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre in his book \"What is literature?\". Sartre argued that intellectuals and the ordinary citizens must take a stand, especially in regard to major political conflicts. Sartre hoped that literature would serve as a means to enable oppressed minority groups gain recognition and that members of the elites would be moved to action as a result of the influence of literature. He argued that should a novel end with a call for action, it has to consciously address groups that have the power to act.\n\nSartre offers a double function for literature, acting as both a mirror for the oppressor and as also as a source of inspiration and guidance for the oppressed, though he does not explicitly explain what the action to be taken is or how to take it within the framework of committed literature. Various actions should be chosen according to their contribution to the realization of a socialist democracy, but the author must not decide according to dogma, in the manner of a conscientious objector.\n\nAs a moral concept, human rights literature deals directly or indirectly with human rights and leads its readers to understand and act to protect human rights. The literary products are accompanied by general information concerning human rights and organizations, as well as suggestions for direct action that go hand in hand with subjects that arise from the literature.\n\nSartre argued that \"the reader of the novel submits to the book before him, abandoning his worldly existence to assume a vicarious one while he reads. He lives the problem which he himself helps to create, placing himself in the most sympathetic position white relation to what the writer wishes to say\". Marina Nemat, author of \"Prisoner of Teheran\" and the winner of the first European Parliament 'Human Dignity' award explains: \"Literature allows the victim to become a survivor and stand up to the past to ensure a better future. It is literature that carries the human experience, reaches our hearts, and makes us feel the pain of those who have been treated unjustly. Without literature and narrative, we would lose our identity as human beings and will dissolve in the darkness of time and our repeated mistakes that lead us from one preventable devastation to the next\".\n\nHence, human rights literature emphasizes the responsibility of the author to delve into writing that is not deliberately isolated from the world and geopolitical events, and regional or global social crises. Human rights literature does not believe in writing for purely artistic aesthetic purposes. It calls on writers to exercise their moral-social duty wherein the power of the literary creation on the public is enormous and rarely come to fruition. According to the American philosopher professor Martha Nussbaum in her book: \"Poetic Justice\" she argues that social sympathy is a necessary condition for equitable treatment in courts of law. Judges, Nussbaum has observed, are short of imaginative data about the persons they must judge, and novels are one place they can look for guidance. The author Richard Rorty wrote in Rorty wrote about the \"human rights culture\" a term he declair to borrow from the Argentinian jurist and philosopher Eduardo Rabossi. In an article called \"Human Rights Naturalized\", Rabossi argues that philosophers should think of this culture as a new, welcome fact of the post-Holocaust world, They should stop trying to get behind or beneath this fact.\n\nIn her essay \"The Tremendous Power of Literature\" Vered Cohen Barzilay writes: \"Literature can be as powerful as life itself. It can be like our prophecy. It can inspire us to change our world and give us the comfort, hope, passion and strength that we need in order to fight to create a better future for us, as well as all humanity. We just need to keep on reading and to allow the tremendous power of literature to enter our hearts and lead us to our own path.\" Indeed, Human Rights Literature does not impose on the authors actual call for action, rather, the writer’s task ends as soon as he completes the writing process. Only the readers’ response can answer whether the creation inspires social change or motivates for action.\n\nHuman rights literature provides the readers with an opportunity for a direct action, however it is not a compulsory requirement. In fact, the commitment is an unwritten accord between the readers and the literary creation developed through the reading process, which holds simultaneously the freedom to refrain from action.\n\nCritics of engaged literature argue that such literature is propaganda and that it is created and used for political purposes. But if the literature becomes propaganda the reader would see through that, and the magic, the intimate process of communion between the reader and the author’s inner voice will not unfold.\n\nIt is argued that for the purpose of reaching the masses such literature will be reduced to the lowest common denominator while compromising quality standards to a limited criteria of stimulation for action. Sartre stresses that both writers and social leaders must constantly aim for developing and improving their readers’ intellectual level, offering readers something beyond the familiar and providing an opportunity to expand horizons.\n\nAnother criticism of engaged literature suggests irrelevance of the commitment for action during times of large-scale events or conflicts once these circumstances change, and while a great novel is eternal and can exist in timeless literary space. Sartre argued that those who attack engaged literature are manifesting again the old desire to retreat into a private shell and ignore events which may someday reach their lives. Authors, he claimed, are trying in vain to isolate themselves from reality, and during a demanding writing process they are cut off from social problems, and thus, create literature for sheer escapism. All novels, whatever else they may do, inevitably instruct us on life. Engaged novel tells us that we may or may not, relate this knowledge to whatever sphere of reality we choose, whenever and however we wish. We cannot meet reality in our own terms. The novel, which has always presented the reader with knowledge of real life, is changing the form of its presentation in order to accord with a more accurate conception of the relation between the individual and reality.\n\nAs Gabriella Ambrosio, author of \"Before We Say Goodbye\", writes in the foreword of her short story \"Sticko\": \"At times, writers are afraid to know what is inevitable: that “pure” art does not exist. None of us is pure or innocent: any word carrying imaginative power produces culture, and culture produces behaviour.\" \n\nAnother dilemma which was raised by intellectuals and in literary circles is the issue of the author’s competence to the task if indeed a novel is an adequate tool for generating social action. Can authors understand the substantive social issues? Or handle the risk and complexity as not to support a false cause? Or be discussed only by experts? What has been suggested was that the engaged novel requires greater talent and wider knowledge by novelists than has been necessary before, and in fact create a new generation of engaged authors.\n\nAs for irrelevance of human rights issues outside a specific context in time, the answer is embodied in the relevance and validity of human rights’ values which were articulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in the aftermath of World War II and the Holocaust. These principles transcend the era in which they were articulated and bring a set of burning social issues to the surface.\nAn example of a novel set in a temporal and geographical context which transcended these limits is Harper Lee’s \"To Kill a Mockingbird\". While the book’s focus on racism in the United States covered events in the author’s environment at a specific time, it highlighted the larger issue of racism and discrimination in a universal manner, transcending the local context of the story. With its social commitment for change, the book had an enormous impact, not only on local issue of racism, but rather as an influencing generations of readers around the world.\n\nUnlike the abstract commitment to social action of Sartre’s engaged literature, human rights literature places human rights at the core of its moral and social duty. It emphasizes the responsibility of the author to delve into writing that is not deliberately cut off from the world, geopolitical changes or social crises. Human rights literature does not believe writing is solely an artistic aesthetic exercise, and calls on writers to realize the social commitment under the power of their literary creation that it effects on the public is enormous and does not come to fruition often. And thus, human rights literature manifests that unique and close links exist between literature and human rights campaigns.\n\nLynn Hunt identified these links. In her book \"Inventing Human Rights: A History\", she examines the emergence of the prose narrative in the 18th century and the role it played in the conception of the human rights idea. Hunt demonstrates how ideas of human relationships portrayed in novels and art generated a powerful fictional empathy which helped spreading this new idea. \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" by Nelle Harper Lee is one example of a novel that had major contribution and impact on American public opinion on the issue of race and rights. Another example is Harriet Beecher Stowe’s \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\", which was the best-selling novel of the 19th century. The book had a deep impact on public opinion in the US on the issue of slavery and is seen as one of the triggers to the Abolitionist movement in the 1850s.\nMany other books and novels had great impact on human rights issues and struggles, for example: Toni Morrison’s \"Beloved\", Giannina Braschi’s \"United States of Banana\", Franz Kafka’s \"The Trial\" and \"Night\" by Elie Wiesel.\n\nWhile the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and subsequent international covenants defined Freedom of Thought and Expression as fundamental human rights, constant and frequent attacks on these freedoms takes place under dictatorships and repressive regimes in attempt to silence any protest or dissent. Censorship is exercised on each and every publication while are often writers and journalists are persecuted, imprisoned and executed. 2010 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Liu Xiaobo is a Chinese literary critic, writer, professor, and human rights activist. He published a manifesto calling for freedom of expression and free elections, and in 2009 was sentenced to 11 years in prison for \"inciting subversion of state power”. Like Xiaobo, many authors suffer persecution as authorities recognize their unique power and ability to impact on the masses. Salman Rushdie, an awarded British-Muslim novelist and essayist of Indian origin became a target following the publication his fourth novel, The Satanic Verses (1988). The book was the center of a major controversy in the Islamic world because of what was perceived as an irreverent depiction of Muhammad. Death threats were made against him, including a fatwā issued by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Supreme Leader of Iran, on 14 February 1989 and a bounty was offered for Rushdie's death. Rushdi was forced to hide and live under police protection for many years.

What makes the Indigenous Peoples Law and Policy (IPLP) Program at the University of Arizona Law (Arizona Law) unique is our approach to legal education in the field of federal Indian law, tribal law and policy, and indigenous peoples human rights. Students are trained in the classroom and in real-world settings by faculty who are leaders both in their academic fields and as practitioners in tribal, national, and international forums. Through clinical studies and direct advocacy under the supervision of the world's most distinguished scholars in the field, students and practitioners provide legal and other forms of assistance to local and international indigenous communities. \n\nThe IPLP Program has been involved in numerous indigenous legal issues around the world. Students and professors in the IPLP Program have assisted Central American Maya villages that have filed lawsuits in the Belize Supreme Court alleging that both the attorney general of Belize and the minister of Natural Resources and Environment had violated their property rights. \n\nFaculty and students of the IPLP Program have worked in coordination with other groups representing Carrie Dann and recently deceased Mary Dann, who have struggled against the federal government for decades over Western Shoshone territory, in precedent-setting proceedings before the Organization of American States' Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. It culminated with the Inter-American Commission issuing a report in which it condemned the United States for violating the Dann sisters' human rights. \n\nIn addition, IPLP Program personnel and affiliates have worked with the people of Awas Tingni, a Mayangna (Sumo) indigenous community located on the Atlantic Coast in Nicaragua, for many years with the landmark case decided by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, Mayagna (Sumo) Community of Awas Tingni v.

The governing legislation in Bulgaria regulating the legal aspects of the subject is the Bulgarian Inheritance Act ().\n\nThe main legal source is the Inheritance Act (BG \"Закон за наследството\", entered into force on the 30th of April 1949). The Act stipulates that inheritance can be inherited either by means of:\nor:\n\nThe right of inheritance is usually governed by statutory provisions which set out the order of succession by the respective successors. The Bulgarian Inheritance Act provides for four levels of successors in order of succession rights whereby those in the preceding level exclude those in the successive ones. The inheritance shall be received by the following natural persons according to the following order:\nIn addition, the spouse of the deceased inherits together with the heirs of the first to the third level and replaces the heirs in the fourth level. It shall be noted that legal entities do not have capacity to receive inheritance. \n\nArticle 13 of the Bulgarian Inheritance Act provides that each person, having reached the age of 18, may dispose of his property upon his death through a Will, provided that he has capacity to act independently and reasonably. The testator may dispose of all of his assets or only parts of it through a Will. The testator may dispose of all of his assets provided that he does not infringe the legally compulsory portion of the inheritance.\nThe Bulgarian Inheritance Act provides for two types of testament:\n\nThe repeal of a testamentary disposition is possible in the cases provided in Article 38 of the Bulgarian Inheritance Act: by drawing a new will or a notarial document expressing the testator’s explicit wish to withdraw the last will.\nAccording to Article 42 may be void in the following cases:\n\n\nIf the deceased has left descendants, parents or a spouse, he shall not deprive them from their compulsory portion either through his testamentary disposition or a gift. The testator shall only dispose of the rest of his assets.\n\nThe heir is vested with inheritance by means of the testator’s wishes. The acceptance of the inheritance is not limited in time. However, it should be noted that once the heir has accepted the inheritance, he may no longer withdraw his acceptance. The inheritance may be accepted by two affirmative legal acts:\n\n\nThe waiver of the succession is carried out by a written declaration to the district court. The declaration is registered in a designated book. The law provides for nullity of the waiver if it is limited, made only for a part of the inheritance or under certain conditions. In case the heir has renounced his share of the inheritance or has otherwise lost his inheritance rights, the shares of the other heirs increase accordingly. \n\nInheritance in Bulgaria is subject to inheritance tax.\n\n\n"}

For example, an individual with a terminal illness and a life expectancy of 6 months would be uninsurable for term life insurance. This is because the probability is so high for the individual to die within the term of the insurance, that he/she would present much too high a liability for the insurance company. A similar, and stereotypical, example would be earthquake insurance in California.\n\nInsurability is sometimes an issue in case law of torts and contracts. It also comes up in issues involving tontines and other insurance fraud schemes. In real property law and real estate, insurability of title means the realty is marketable.\n\nRisk which can be insured by private companies typically share seven common characteristics.\n\n\nInsurable interest refers to the right of property to be insured. It may also mean the interest of a beneficiary of a life insurance policy to prove need for the proceeds, called the \"insurable interest doctrine\". Specifically, insurable interest is:\nThus, husbands/wives have an insurable interest in their spouse, and children have an insurable interest in their parents (and vice versa). Close relatives are assumed to have an insurable interest in the lives of those relatives, but more distant relatives, such as cousins and in-laws cannot buy insurance of the lives of others related by these connections.\n\nA person is presumed to have an insurable interest in his or her own life, preferring to be alive and in good health rather than being sick, injured or dead. If a person obtains an insurance policy on their own life, it is presumed that the person would only name a beneficiary who wants the insured to be alive and healthy.\n\nA person is considered to have an unlimited interest in the life of their spouse, which the law considers broadly equivalent to having an insurable interest in their own life. Even if not financially dependent on the other, it is legitimate to insure against the death of a spouse. Although many insurers will accept policies of cohabiting couples, they could potentially be invalidated. In recent years, there have been moves to pass clear statutory provisions in this regard, which have not yet borne fruit. Similar treatment was recently extended to civil partners under section 253 of the Civil Partnership Act 2004 and in the law of some states.\n\nInsurable interest is no longer strictly an element of life insurance contracts under modern law, for example with viatication agreements and charitable donations. Often there is no requirement today that the beneficiary have a proven insurable interest in the life of the insured when the insured has purchased the insurance.\n\n"}

Legal impossibility arises when the act, if completed, would not be a crime. A person believes she is committing a crime, but the act is, in fact, lawful. For example, a person may believe she is receiving stolen goods, but the goods are in fact not stolen.\n\nA different form of legal impossibility (Known as \"hybrid legal impossibility\") comes into play when an actor's goal is illegal, but commission of the crime is impossible due to a factual mistake regarding the legal status of one of the attendant circumstances of one of the elements of the crime. For example, a man attempting to bribe someone whom he mistakenly believes is a juror is not liable for attempted bribery of a juror. On the other hand, some jurisdictions may find the actor guilty of attempt. For example, under the Model Penal Code, the defendant can be guilty of the attempted crime if the facts being the way she thought they were would indeed make it a crime; however, she would not be guilty of the completed crime, because the crime was never completed.\n\nSee also impossibility defense.\n"}

After killing a trainer in Kingsport, Tennessee, she was hanged in nearby Erwin, Tennessee, in 1916. Her death is sometimes interpreted as a cautionary tale of circus animal abuse during the early 20th century.\n\nOn September 11, 1916, a homeless man named Red Eldridge, who landed a job as a transient hotel clerk, was hired as an assistant elephant trainer by the \"Sparks World Famous Shows\" circus. He was killed by Mary in Sullivan County, Tennessee, on the evening of September 12. Eldridge led the elephant parade, although he was not qualified, riding on the top of Mary's back; Mary was the star of the show, walking at the front. There have been several accounts of his death. One, recounted by W.H. Coleman, who claimed to be a witness, is that he prodded her behind the ear with a hook after she reached down to nibble on a watermelon rind. She went into a rage, snatched Eldridge with her trunk, threw him against a drink stand and stepped on his head, crushing it.\n\nA contemporary newspaper account, from the \"Johnson City Staff\", said that Mary \"collided its trunk vice-like about [Eldridge's] body, lifted him 10 feet in the air, then dashed him with fury to the ground... and with the full force of her beastly fury is said to have sunk [sic] her giant tusks entirely through his body. The animal then trampled the dying form of Eldridge as if seeking a murderous triumph, then with a sudden... swing of her massive foot hurled his body into the crowd.\"\n\nThe details of the aftermath are confused in a maze of sensationalist newspaper stories and folklore. Most accounts indicate that she calmed down afterward and did not charge the onlookers, who began chanting \"Kill the elephant! Let's kill it.\" Within minutes, local blacksmith Hench Cox tried to kill Mary, firing five rounds with little effect. Meanwhile, the leaders of several nearby towns threatened not to allow the circus to visit if Mary was included.\nThe circus owner, Charlie Sparks, reluctantly decided that the only way to quickly resolve the potentially ruinous situation was to kill the wounded elephant in public. On the following day, a foggy and rainy September 13, 1916, Mary was transported by rail to Unicoi County, Tennessee, where a crowd of over 2,500 people (including most of the town's children) assembled in the Clinchfield Railroad yard.\n\nThe elephant was hanged by the neck from a railcar-mounted industrial derrick between four o'clock and five o'clock that afternoon. The first attempt resulted in a snapped chain, causing Mary to fall and break her hip as dozens of children fled in terror. The severely wounded elephant died during a second attempt and was buried beside the tracks. A veterinarian examined Mary after the hanging and determined that she had a severely infected tooth in the precise spot where Red Eldridge had prodded her. The authenticity of a widely distributed (and heavily retouched) photo of her death was disputed years later by \"Argosy\" magazine.\n\n\n\n"}

These terms are used in relation to the United Kingdom parliament in Westminster, and other parliaments and assemblies based on the Westminster system. The official title, and organisation, of the parliamentary counsel varies between legislatures. For example, those who draft government legislation for the UK parliament form the Parliamentary Counsel Office (established in 1869 under the title of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel) while the Scottish Government's Parliamentary Counsel Office drafts legislation for the Scottish Parliament, the (Northern Irish) Office of the Legislative Counsel drafts legislation for the Northern Ireland Assembly and the (Welsh) Office of the Legislative Counsel performs the same role in relation to the National Assembly for Wales. In the Republic of Ireland, there is an Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to Government. In Australia, each state, territory and the federal government has an Office of Parliamentary Counsel. \n\nThe job of a parliamentary drafter is to draft the detailed form of proposed laws, in a way that will accurately reflect the intentions of the politicians who are promulgating them, without leaving loopholes or producing perverse results. This is an almost impossible task, and the pursuit of exact and watertight legislation has often resulted in obscure and convoluted language. Such language has been criticised both by government bodies such as the committee under Sir David Renton that reported in 1975 (and recommended drafting which was more based on principles than specific details to address every possible situation). \n\nIn parliamentary discussion, the drafter is rarely if ever referred to by name, but only as an office.

{"id": "26615557", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26615557", "title": "Pre-packaged insolvency", "text": "Pre-packaged insolvency\n\nPre-packaged insolvency (a \"pre-pack\") is a kind of bankruptcy procedure, where a restructure plan is agreed in advance of a company declaring its insolvency. In the United States pre-packs are often used in a Chapter 11 filing. In the United Kingdom, pre-packs have become popular since the Enterprise Act 2002, which has made administration the dominant insolvency procedure. Such arrangements are also available in Canada under the Companies' Creditors Arrangements Act.\n\nThe term \"pre-pack sale\" has been defined by the Association of Business Recovery Professionals as, \"an arrangement under which the sale of all or part of a company’s business or assets is negotiated with a purchaser prior to the appointment of an administrator, and the administrator effects the sale immediately on, or shortly after, his appointment\". The difference between a pre-pack sale and a normal sale is that in a normal sale the administrator markets the business and negotiates the terms of the sale after his appointment.\n\nThe reasons an administrator sells on a pre-pack basis, rather than after post-appointment marketing, vary from case to case, but they often involve the following considerations. A pre-pack sale avoids the costs of trading (which means creditors receive more back), and indeed, the company and the administrator may not have the funds to trade. It also avoids the administrator taking on the risks associated with trading. The value of the business may deteriorate during administration trading.\n\nThere may be other factors to prevent trading, such as regulatory problems.\n\nThe courts have held that an administrator can sell the company's assets immediately upon his appointment, without court approval or the approval of the creditors, and he can do so even if the majority creditor objects. Courts have even approved transactions that, as a \"necessary evil\", have made payments to the former management while leaving little or nothing to unsecured creditors.\n\nIn January 2009, the Association of Business Recovery Professionals issued \"Statement of Insolvency Practice 16\" to require insolvency practitioners acting as administrators to disclose a number of matters to all creditors as soon as possible after the completion of the sale. This was done in an attempt to provide greater transparency to creditors.\n\nOn 1 November 2013, following a government-commissioned review, a new \"Statement of Insolvency Practice 16\" was introduced. It requires administrators to disclose the following:\n\nThe main benefit of a pre-pack administration is the 'continuity' of the business - the company is protected by the court. This gets rid of debts and contracts. It does not get rid of employees due to the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 (TUPE). Another big advantage is that the cost of the process is lower than trading administration, as the administrators do not need to find funding to trade the business. The downside of a pre-pack administration is that it can attract negative publicity if the former directors are seen to be shedding liabilities.\n\nThe Insolvency Service monitors compliance with SIP 16. Its reports show that in 2010 it reported 10 insolvency practitioners to their licensing bodies, and in 2011 it reported 21.\n\nIn the United States, typically the term \"pre-packaged insolvency\" is recoined as pre-packaged bankruptcy. A conventional bankruptcy case is one in which the debtor files for Chapter 11 relief without having agreed in advance to the terms of a plan of reorganization with its creditors. During the course of the Chapter 11 case, the debtor or, if the debtor does not retain the exclusive right to propose a plan, a creditor or creditor group may formulate and propose a plan of reorganization. A company undergoing Chapter 11 reorganization is effectively operating under the \"protection\" of the court until it emerges. An example is the airline industry; in 2006, over half the industry's seating capacity was on airlines that were in Chapter 11.\n\nIn a pre-packaged case, the plan proponents will have secured sufficient support from creditors to confirm their plan of reorganization prior to filing for Chapter 11 reorganization. Pre-packaged plans of reorganization virtually always impair (i.e. pay less than in full) one or more classes of creditors, and so in order to ensure that the plan can be confirmed by the bankruptcy court, the plan proponents must secure the support of at least two-thirds in amount and more than one-half in number of at least one such impaired class, in addition to ensuring the plan complies with all other requirements for confirmation. Two procedurally difficult aspects of the process are the announcement (which must be structured so as not to trigger contractual termination provisions) and getting the requisite creditor approval.\n\nIn 2009, a new entity completed the purchase of continuing operations, assets and trademarks of General Motors as a part of the 'pre-packaged' Chapter 11 reorganization. As ranked by total assets, GM's bankruptcy marks one of the largest corporate Chapter 11 bankruptcies in US history. The Chapter 11 filing was the fourth-largest in US history, following Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., Washington Mutual and WorldCom Inc. A new entity with the backing of the United States Treasury was formed to acquire profitable assets, under section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, with the new company planning to issue an initial public offering (IPO) of stock in 2010. The remaining pre-petition creditors claims are paid from the former corporation's assets.\n\nA review from Wolverhampton University identified the several criticisms of pre-pack sales. There is a general concern that the pre-pack administrator, in agreeing to the pre-pack in consultation with the company’s management team (and usually its secured creditors), favours the interests of the managers and secured creditors ahead of those of the unsecured creditors. The speed and secrecy of the transaction often lead to a deal being executed, about which the unsecured creditors know nothing and offers them little or no return.\n\nThere is often a suspicion that the consideration paid for the business may not have been maximized due to the absence of open marketing. Credit may have been incurred inappropriately prior to the pre-pack and this may not be fully investigated. Criticism of this nature had been levelled at pre-pack sales by John Moulton of Alchemy Partners in January 2009, saying 'Pre-packs could be very easily abused. Bad management can plan for a prepack months in advance, line up an administrator – and then be back running the business immediately. It means when retailers fail they are often being kept with the same directors when it would be much healthier if new management arrived and with fresh money to invest\".\n"}

Harney (Commander of the U.S. Army's Western Department) and Missouri State Guard commander Sterling Price at the beginning of the American Civil War.\n\nThe truce sought to forestall the outbreak of violence in the state of Missouri following the Camp Jackson Affair, in which Union army troops under the command of Captain Nathaniel Lyon had captured Missouri State Militia mustered on the outskirts of St. Louis. While Lyon marched the captured militia to the St. Louis Arsenal through a crowd, a civilian riot ensued. The soldiers fired into the crowd and killed several people. In the aftermath of the riot, the Missouri State Legislature enacted the governor's \"Military Bill\" replacing the Missouri State Militia with a new Missouri State Guard. The governor appointed Sterling Price major general and commander of the State Guard.\n\nGeneral Harney had been away from St. Louis during the Camp Jackson affair. Upon his return, he met with Price to sign a joint statement \"for the purpose of removing misapprehensions and allaying public excitement,\" its object being \"that of restoring peace and good order to the people of the State in subordination to the laws of the General and State Governments.\"\n\nThe Price–Harney Truce made federal forces responsible for order in the St. Louis area, and state forces responsible for order in the rest of the state. Under the terms of the truce, as understood by Harney, the agreement obligated the Missouri State Guard to protect Unionist Missourians from harassment and to hold the state for the Union. Harney also informed Price that several clauses in Missouri's recently enacted \"Military Bill\" would have to be modified to remove potential conflicts with the federal government's legal authority.\n\nThe truce drew the immediate ire of a wide variety of Missouri Unionists (including the politically powerful Congressman Frank Blair), who lobbied President Lincoln and the War Department to have Harney relieved of command. In the face of reports of abuses against Missouri Unionists, and continued negotiations between Governor Jackson and the Confederate Government, Lincoln approved Harney's replacement as commander of the Western District by newly promoted Brigadier General Nathaniel Lyon. The change of command took place on May 30. Whereas Harney was recognized as a legalistic and cautious Unionist, Lyon was an outspoken Abolitionist, with a long-standing relationship with several militant Missouri Unionist organizations. Lyon's elevation effectively ended the truce with Price.\n\nOn June 11 Missouri Governor Claiborne Fox Jackson held a last-ditch meeting at the Planter's House Hotel in St. Louis to delay open conflict in the State. Jackson was an open Confederate sympathizer and Price had been a conditional Unionist until the Camp Jackson Affair. During the meeting, Lyon angrily refused Price's requests to limit federal forces to the metropolitan St. Louis area, and to disband \"Home Guard\" companies established by Missouri Unionists. Lyon refused to accept any limitations on his military actions in the state, and eventually halted the meeting, informing Governor Jackson and MG Price that such limitations on federal authority \"means war\". Price and Jackson returned to the State Capitol at Jefferson City, and worked to concentrate State Guard forces in anticipation of open warfare with Unionist forces. Three days later Lyon landed troops at the state capitol from steamboats and occupied the city without a shot fired. Lyon's mixed force of volunteers and Regulars subsequently routed the State Guard at the June 17, 1861 Battle of Boonville which gave Unionist forces control of Jefferson City, the Missouri River line and the strategic North Missouri Railroad.\n\nIn the absence of Governor Jackson, who had fled to the southern part of the state with the Guardsmen, the State Constitutional Convention called itself into session, declared the office of governor vacant, and appointed Hamilton Gamble, former state chief justice, as governor of the Provisional Government of Missouri. Gamble served from 1861 to 1864, when he died in office.\n\nMissouri Secession\n\n"}

This rule was repealed by the FCC in 1996.\n\nThe PTAR was issued in 1970 and was implemented at the beginning of the 1971-72 television season (the week of September 13–19, 1971). It was re-examined periodically and underwent several modifications since its initial implementation.\n\nThe PTAR was instated over the concern that the three major television networks (ABC, CBS, and NBC) dominated the television program production market, controlled much of the programming presented to the public, and inhibited the development of competing program sources. The FCC believed that PTAR would ultimately increase the level of competition in program production, reduce the networks' control over programming decisions made by their affiliates, and thereby increase the diversity of programs available to the public.\n\nTo ensure that independent companies would have access, the FCC, at the same time, instituted the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules (commonly known as \"fin-syn\"), which prohibited networks from owning syndication arms. Existing syndication divisions operated by the networks were forced to be spun off as new companies independent of network management (such as Viacom, originally created by CBS to distribute its content, and eventually expanded outside of program syndication and distribution in the succeeding years post-spinoff).\n\nImmediately prior to its repeal, the Prime Time Access Rule applied only to owned-and-operated or affiliated network stations in the 50 largest television markets. It restricted these stations from broadcasting more than three hours of network programming during the four-hour prime-time block each evening and established the first hour of prime time (7:00–8:00 p.m. Eastern Time and Pacific Time, 6:00–7:00 p.m. Central, Mountain, Alaska and Hawaii–Aleutian Time) as the \"prime access hour\".\n\nBy the early 1980s, the PTAR had introduced a policy amendment prohibiting stations in the 50 television markets with the highest prime time viewership from broadcasting more than three hours of network programming during the four-hour \"prime time\" block. Stations had to find original programming to fill during the \"prime time\" fraction. However, the rule exempted certain types of programming, such as overruns of live sports events, special news, documentary and children's programming, and certain sports and network programming of a special nature.\n\nTo comply with the PTAR, most local television stations presented at least one syndicated game show between 7:00 and 8:00 p.m.; ironically, these were usually additional episodes of existing network daytime game shows (occasionally with a different host), distributed by companies that before 1971 had been subsidiaries owned by the networks (such as the former CBS property Viacom and former ABC property Worldvision Enterprises) and produced by the same production companies at the same studios as their daytime counterparts, effectively circumventing the purpose of the rule. Other programming that was often scheduled in these time slots were revivals of \"Hee Haw\" and \"The Lawrence Welk Show\" (both shows that had been canceled by their respective networks, CBS and ABC, in the spring of 1971, before PTAR took effect). Still others (most notably WIS in Columbia, SC) used the hour to carry their local evening newscast, a tradition that continues to this day.\n\nThe loss of the extra hour forced networks to eliminate a significant amount of its programming schedule; this led to an exacerbation of an already-existing trend in television programming known as the \"rural purge\", where programming that targeted less affluent, rural or older viewers (most notably, several series carried by CBS including \"The Beverly Hillbillies\", \"Mayberry R.F.D.\" and \"Green Acres\") was cancelled by the networks.\n\nThe PTAR was eliminated on August 30, 1996, the commission having determined it was \"no longer necessary\" as a tool to promote independent production or affiliate autonomy. While the major networks have not reclaimed the traditional \"access\" period in early primetime, this is most likely due to pressure from affiliates to retain control of one of the more profitable parts of their programming schedules. Several syndicated programs (such as \"Entertainment Tonight\", \"Wheel of Fortune\" and \"Jeopardy!\") are still broadcast in the \"prime access hour\", and have earned audiences equal to or greater than many network shows. Other broadcast stations have expanded local news operations to carry local newscasts in the said hour. In 2010, Fox was allowed to present World Series games that started around 7:30 p.m. Eastern Time, so as to prevent games from running into the 11:00 p.m. (Eastern) hour. In 2014 and 2015, CBS moved its Thursday prime time to start at 7:30 p.m. for the first eight weeks of the season to allow for a full pregame show for \"Thursday Night Football\".\n\nSmaller networks such as Pax TV began programming full 24-hour schedules after the rule change. Some networks, though, had programmed the \"access\" hour despite the rule, particularly Spanish-language networks that hold responsibility for the majority of their affiliates' programming schedules, such as Univision and Telemundo.\n\nA 1975 revision to the PTAR allowed networks to program the 7:00 p.m./6:00 p.m. time slot on Sundays, and the majority of the major networks have done so ever since. ABC has programmed \"America's Funniest Home Videos\" in the slot for much of the time since 1993 (except for a period from 1997 to 2002, when ABC broadcast \"The Wonderful World of Disney\" in the 7:00 p.m. hour), while CBS has shown \"60 Minutes\" in the slot consistently since 1975. NBC has mostly broadcast \"Dateline NBC\" in the slot since 1996, though since regaining NFL broadcasting rights in 2006, during football season the network airs \"Football Night in America\" in the slot as a pre-game show to its \"NBC Sunday Night Football\" broadcasts. \n\nThe slot has been used by the networks to broadcast run-over programming from NFL games, since the NFL broadcasting contracts require the games to air in their entirety (this happened as a result of the Heidi Game in 1968, in which NBC cut away from an Oakland Raiders-New York Jets game to air the television film \"Heidi\", prior to the Raiders' comeback late in the fourth quarter). While CBS \"shifts\" its Sunday evening schedule to start after its NFL coverage concludes, Fox has utilized a different approach: the network completely pre-empted its lineup until the last game it held the right to broadcast in each region had finished until 2004, upon which it joined its prime-time lineup in progress (pre-empting portions or even the entirety of programs scheduled to air in the \"first\" hour of its prime time schedule following the game's designated time slot). Similarly, if necessary, major tournaments in professional golf are also treated in this manner; since 1987 (the year Daylight Saving Time was moved earlier), The Masters Tournament has begun to finish into the hour. The U. S. Open and Men's PGA Championship, depending on the region, also can be overrun into the time slot, with Pacific Time Zone tournaments allowing networks to run into prime time hours. \n\nSince 2005, Fox has aired the post-game show, \"\", in the slot as \"filler\" programming between its NFL coverage and \"The Simpsons\" at 8:00 p.m., with its length depending on how late the final game ends, since NFL games with a 4:25 p.m. (Eastern) start time almost always end by 8:00 p.m., even if the game goes into overtime. Fox has continued the practice for Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series races, as the Daytona 500 and on occasion, a West Coast Swing event such as the Auto Club Speedway round, was designed to creep into the 7:00 p.m. hour, and the U. S. Open, typically held on the Sunday closest to the longest day of the year, will also do such. Before that, the 7:00 p.m. hour on Fox was seen similar to that of the Friday night death slot on all of the networks, as several shows near the end of their runs (such as \"Malcolm in the Middle\", \"Family Guy\" and \"Futurama\") were scheduled to air in the time period but ultimately got pre-empted by Fox's NFL coverage. This tradition has continued during the off-season, with the most recent examples of shows burned off on Sundays at 7:00 p.m. half-hour being \"'Til Death\" and \"Sons of Tucson\" during the spring and summer of 2010, and \"Mulaney\" in 2014.\n\nOn October 7, 2018, The CW resumed programming a prime time lineup on Sunday nights. However, unlike its previous effort to program that night from the network's launch in September 2006 (a byproduct of originally adopting co-predecessor The WB's 30-hour weekly base schedule upon The CW's launch) until it ceded the timeslot to its affiliates in September 2009, The CW opted to only to offer programming during the \"common prime\" slot (8:00 to 10:00 p.m. ET/PT) offered on weekdays and Saturdays by the conventional broadcast networks that have launched on U.S. television since Fox's expansion to include prime time program offerings in April 1987. This move marked the first such instance of a major U.S. television network not programming that hour since the 1975 PTAR revision was implemented.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "501847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=501847", "title": "Public-interest immunity", "text": "Public-interest immunity\n\nPublic-interest immunity (PII), previously known as Crown privilege, is a principle of English common law under which the English courts can grant a court order allowing one litigant to refrain from disclosing evidence to the other litigants where disclosure would be damaging to the public interest. This is an exception to the usual rule that all parties in litigation must disclose any evidence that is relevant to the proceedings. In making a PII order, the court has to balance the public interest in the administration of justice (which demands that relevant material is available to the parties to litigation) and the public interest in maintaining the confidentiality of certain documents whose disclosure would be damaging. PII orders have been used in criminal law against large organised criminal outfits and drug dealers where the identity of paid police informants could be at risk.\n\nAn order that PII applies would usually be sought by the British government to protect official secrets, and so can be perceived as a gagging order. Where a minister believes that PII applies, he signs a PII certificate, which then allows the court to make the final decision on whether the balance of public interest was in favour of disclosure or not. Generally, a court will allow a claim of PII without inspecting the documents: only where there is some doubt will the court inspect the documents to decide whether PII applies.\n\nOriginally, a government minister was under a duty to advance a PII point where PII could be relevant, and the court took a certificate from a minister claiming PII as final and conclusive. However, over time, there has been an increase in both the ability of a minister to make a disclosure, notwithstanding the potential application of PII, and the ability of the courts to review a claim of PII. In \"Conway v Rimmer\" [1968], the House of Lords held that the courts retained the final decision on whether PII should be upheld, and, in \"R v Chief Constable of West Midlands, ex parte Wiley\" [1995], the House of Lords decided that a minister could discharge his duty by making his own judgment of where the public interest lies (that is, to disclose or to assert PII). In practice, this is thought to have led to a reduction in the number of cases when PII is asserted.\n\nPII was previously known as Crown Privilege, and derived from the same principle as the immunity of the Crown from prosecution before the Crown Proceedings Act 1947. However, PII is not limited to the Crown (see the \"NSPCC\" case mentioned below), and cannot be waived save in exceptional circumstances.\n\nA number of PII certificates were signed in relation to the prosecutions of individuals involved in the Matrix Churchill \"Arms to Iraq\" case, a subject that was subsequently investigated in the Scott Report.\n\n\nArticle 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights protects the right to a fair trial; an \"implied\" right stemming from this is that of \"equality of arms\" – the idea that hearings should be adversarial and both parties should have access to the same evidence and witnesses. The European Court of Human Rights has held that Article 6 (especially the \"implied\" rights) is not an absolute right and that measures restricting the rights of the defence so as to safeguard an important public interest are lawful if \"strictly necessary\".\n\nIt is of note that fewer PII certificates have been issued in recent years. For example, MI6 have not succeeded in obtaining a PII certificate since the 1995 Tomlinson case, and have thus been subject to court scrutiny for investigations such as the inquest into the death of the Princess of Wales, and allegations that their officers partook in torture.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "924751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=924751", "title": "Refund anticipation loan", "text": "Refund anticipation loan\n\nRefund anticipation loan (RAL) is a short-term consumer loan in the United States provided by a third party against an expected tax refund for the duration it takes the tax authority to pay the refund. The loan term was usually about two to three weeks, related to the time it took the U.S. Internal Revenue Service to deposit refunds in electronic accounts. The loans were designed to make the refund available in as little as 24 hours. They were secured by a taxpayer's expected tax refund, and designed to offer customers quicker access to funds.\n\nThe costs to the borrower could be significant compared to other lending and some consumer organizations warned consumers of the risk involved in this type of loan. They are a largely discontinued financial product and beginning with the 2013 tax filing season, they have been largely replaced with the similar refund anticipation checks (RAC), as well as a hodge podge of other financial products.\n\nRACs are temporary accounts which wait for the client's IRS tax refund, and which also provides a way for the client to pay for tax preparation out of the refund. Both financial products have similar fees and similar risks of third-party bank \"cross-collection\".\n\nA similar process in Canada to a RAL is termed \"tax rebate discounting\".\n\nIn the United States prior to the 2013 tax filing season, taxpayers could apply for a refund anticipation loan through a paid professional tax preparation service, where a fee is typically charged for the preparation of the tax return. Internal Revenue Service rules prohibit basing this fee on the amount of the expected refund. An additional fee was usually charged for the services of originating a bank product and establishing a short-term bank account. By law this fee must be the same on both loan and non-loan bank products, and in 2004 the average fee was $32. The bank through which the loan was made charges finance charges.\n\nAccording to the National Consumer Law Center, 12 million taxpayers used a RAL in 2004. With e-filing and IRS partnerships that help consumers e-file for free, U.S. taxpayers can generally receive their tax refunds within three weeks and sometimes as quickly as ten to fourteen days if they choose to receive their refund via direct deposit. As of 2017, 70% of US taxpayers have access to free e-file and tax preparation services. This rendered RALs less attractive to some.\n\nRALs began in 1985 when Ronald Smith, an Accountant in Virginia Beach, VA started the practice of Refund Advance Loans at his accounting firm, Action Accounting & Taxes located at 5441 Virginia Beach Blvd. This service of Loans On Tax Refunds was advertised widely through WYAH, TV and on Cox Cable in the Hampton Roads area by Action Accounting & Taxes in 1985, 1986 and 1987. The Advance Refund Loans became a huge business success from the start and a sensation in the area in 1986 and 1987 and was the first and only firm in the United States that was offering that service according to the IRS. In 1986 a salesman from Charlie Falk's Auto on Virginia Beach Blvd, where today Town Centre now exits, asked Mr. Smith if they could make an arrangement where Action Accounting & Taxes could prepare taxes for customers seeking to purchase cars in order to supplement their down payments on used or new car purchases. Mr. Smith agreed to this idea and that was the beginning of Loans on Tax Refunds being used in conjunction with car financing and that practice then quickly spread throughout the area and then throughout the entire United States. Mr. Smith was the first one to invent, organize and pioneer the process of Tax Refund Loans in this way and went on to make millions in this business. The financing was originally fully handled by Joel S. Coplon and Company, a small private financing company closely connected with Mr. Smith at the time. Action Accounting and Taxes, the firm that Mr. Smith owned, was one mile from where John Hewitt was just starting a new business venture. Mr. Hewitt had just recently purchased Mel Jackson's Tax Service which was a run down group of offices throughout the Hampton Road's area. Mr. Hewitt began to offer Refund Anticipation Loans in 1988 and built a national franchise out of the idea which funded and built Jackson Hewitt Tax Service. Then in 1989 H & R Block joined in the industry and it became a billion dollar industry across the United States being coopted into thousands of different accounting firms and tax practices across the United States and abroad. It was reported in 1989 that H & R Block had doubled it's business at over 4,000 locations due to the introduction of this new Refund Loan Service. It later spread to Canada as well through Liberty Tax Service and in time this company moved into the United States market as well offering the same service. The proliferation of this tax loan practice coincided with the introduction of electronic filing which IRS introduced electronic filing as a way to decrease its cost of operation. Previous to this time refunds would take on average two to three months to come back from the IRS which is why the Loan on Tax Refund also known as Refund Anticipations Loan business flourished. In 1988, Mr. Smith as well as Mr. Coplon were jointly sued by the Attorney General of Virginia in a Richmond State Court for charging usurious interest. Mr. Smith was eventually dismissed from the case and it was reported by the State's Attorney at the time that the reason for his dismissal from the case was that Mr. Smith was \"not culpable\".\n\nA tax preparer would, within 24 hours of submission, receive from the IRS confirmation that the submission was free of mathematical errors, and that the filer had no liens or delinquent federal student loans. This meant that there was good chance that the IRS would pay the refund within weeks, barring fraudulent income reporting. At that point the preparer would issue the filer a check for the amount of the expected refund minus a commission. In 1995, the \"New York Times\" reported that Beneficial's $30 electronic filing fee and $59 loan fee amounted to a 250 percent APR on a refund of $1,000.\n\nExploitation of the system had begun by the early 1990s; filers misreported their income to inflate their refund. As a result of this, and also to discourage filers from this rather uneconomical offer, in 1994 the IRS stopped providing tax preparers a confirmation that a deposit would take place for a certain amount and that it would begin sending refunds directly to taxpayers instead of banks that made the loan, but not having the desired effects, the confirmations were re-instated the following year.\n\nAccording to the Consumer Federation of America and the National Consumer Law Center, RALs are controversial because, like payday loans and title loans, RALs are high-profit, low-risk loans marketed toward the working poor. A 2006 study by the NCLC and the Consumer Federation of America found that \"Based upon the prices for RALs in 2006, a consumer can expect to pay about $100 in order to get a RAL for the average refund of about $2,150 from a commercial tax preparation chain this year\".\n\nOpponents of RALs, like the National Consumer Law Center, argue that the profit motive of the lender results in RALs being issued too often to low-income individuals who are made to believe the wait for their refund is longer than it really is, who do not realize they are taking a loan, do not understand the high interest rates charged by the loan (often exceeding 100% APR until the last two tax filing seasons), and who do not actually need the funds immediately.\n\nAs part of applying for both financial products, the client is directing his or her refund to the account-issuing bank. Cross-collection occurs in cases where the bank uses this occasion to collect debt owed another bank. As the IRS Taxpayer Advocate described the practice in 2006: \"if a taxpayer owes money on a defaulted RAL to Bank A and subsequently attempts to buy another RAL from Bank B, Bank B is authorized to collect the outstanding debt from the RAL proceeds, transmit the funds to Bank A\". It is somewhat unclear how broad is the type of debt for which banks cross-collect. This practice is often not adequately disclosed to the tax preparation client. As a lawsuit filing against H&R Block by the California Attorney General in February 2006 stated, \"H&R Block does not adequately tell such customers about any alleged debts, or that when they sign the new RAL application, they agree to automatic debt collection—including collection on alleged RAL-related debts from other tax preparers or banks. These applications are denied, and the customer's anticipated refund is used to pay off the debt, plus a fee\". Tax prep firms often vaguely refer to this practice merely as \"previous debt\".\n\nThis risk exists even if the client is only using the RAC account for purposes of taking the tax preparation fees out of the refund.\n\nOn August 5, 2010, the IRS announced that for the upcoming 2011 tax filing season, the agency would no longer be providing preparers and associated financial institutions with the \"debt indicator\" (a one-letter code that discloses whether or not the taxpayer owes back taxes and whether or not the taxpayer owes federally collected obligations such as child support, student loans, etc.).\n\nTaxpayers themselves will continue to have access to information about their refund through the \"Where's My Refund?\" feature at the irs.gov website.\n\nIn the same news release, the IRS stated it was exploring ways to allow filers to directly split off part of the refund to pay for professional tax preparation, possibly starting in January 2012. The IRS is asking for input from filers, consumer advocates, and those in the tax preparation community regarding whether this would be cost-effective.\n\nBeginning with the 2013 tax season, major U.S. banks will no longer be offering RALs. They will instead be offering the similar financial products of RACs, which are not loans but are rather temporary accounts which sit empty waiting for the client's IRS refund.\n\n\n\n"}

It produces, maintains, licenses, and markets stock market indices as benchmarks and as the basis of investable products, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), mutual funds, and structured products. The company currently has employees in 15 cities worldwide, including New York, London, Frankfurt, Singapore, Hong Kong, Beijing, and Dubai.\n\nThe company's best known indices are the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), which was created in 1896. The company also manages the oldest index in use, the Dow Jones Transportation Index, created in 1882 by Charles Dow, the founder of \"The Wall Street Journal\".\n\nA market index (plural: indices) follows a certain market and gives investors a single number to summarize its ups and downs. It enables the world's institutional (and retail) investors to track a market or market sector without having to aggregate the underlying components. It is a convenient way for someone interested in a broad, narrow, or extremely narrow group of securities to track them.\n\nPension funds and other money managers often use indexes as benchmarks. This means that \"active\" investors (those who pick various securities to buy and hold for their returns) track their own returns against a benchmark index (an index that typifies its market) to see if they are out- or under-performing that market. Investors who do not want to do this (those who buy into indexes or securities that use indexes as their basis) are called \"passive\" investors. They are known to link their portfolios to the broad market and do not try to outguess conventional market wisdom. Passive investors argue that almost no active investors can beat the overall markets in the long-term. This choice is described by a theory in investing called the efficient market hypothesis.\n\nThe DJI has over 130,000 indexes, although many are used by only relatively few people. Most are principally equity (stock) indexes but also contain fixed-income, futures, options, private equity, commodity, currency, bond, and other alternative asset class metrics. Dow Jones Indexes says that all its products are maintained according to clear, unbiased, and systematic methodologies that are fully integrated within index families.\n\nDJI and Sustainable Asset Management (SAM), launched the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices in 1999. These indexes track performance of sustainability-driven companies around the world. There are currently 70 DJSI licensees held by asset managers in 16 countries to manage a variety of financial products, including active and passive funds, certificates and segregated accounts.\n\nDJI partnered with AIG to create the Dow Jones-AIG Commodity Index. It tracks trades on futures contracts for physical commodities, like energy (petroleum, gas), precious metals (gold, silver), industrial metals (zinc, copper), grains (corn, wheat), livestock (lean hogs, live cattle), among others.\n\nUBS Securities LLC has acquired AIG Financial Product Corp.'s commodity business as of May 6, 2009. As such, the Dow Jones-AIG Commodity Indexes have been re-branded as the Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Indexes effective May 7, 2009.\n\nThe Dow Jones Select Dividend Indexes reflects the performance of leading dividend-yielding stocks. It includes global and regional indexes. It was DJI's first fundamentals-driven index.\n\nDow Jones Indexes also does \"specialty\" indexes for specific markets or interests. It has the Dow Jones U.S. Economic Stimulus Index, the Olympic-inspired Dow Jones Summer/Winter Games, the race-car centric Dow Jones Formula 1 Index and the closely followed Dow Jones Luxury Index, among others.\n\nCompanies can also request that specific indexes be created to suit their clients' interest or for publicity purposes. This is popular with smaller asset management and public relations firms.\n\nDJI launches an average of one index or index family per week. It often creates an index for a specific event (i.e. Dow Jones 2008 Summer Games Index, launched December 2007), a specific market (Dow Jones Luxury Index, launched June 2008), or a very small market (Dow Jones Cyprus Titans 10 Index). In some instances it cooperates with other entities to create a custom index (Barron’s 400 Index, launched September 2007).\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average historical data (along with several other major indexes) recently became available on a new website, www.djaverages.com. The company also has a widely read quarterly newsletter called \"Insights\" that covers the industry.\n\nThe City of New York also declared the day to be \"Dow Jones Industrial Average Day.\"\n\nLater that month, Dow Jones Indexes and BBVA jointly launched the Dow Jones BBVA EAGLEs Indexes series, which initially includes two market gauges each designed to measure the stock performance of 50 leading companies in emerging and growth-leading economies (EAGLEs). The first set of EAGLEs included China, Indonesia, India, South Korea, Mexico, Taiwan, Brazil, Russia, Turkey and Egypt.\n\n\nThe company produces a quarterly news magazine called Insights.

SADR is a partially recognized state which claims sovereignty over the entire territory of Western Sahara, but only administers part of that territory.\n\nThe legal basis for Sahrawi nationality law is established in Article 104 of the Sahrawi constitution which provides that the Sahrawi National Council can make:\n\nGenerally, international practice is that nationality is established at birth by a child's place of birth (jus soli) or bloodline (jus sanguinis). When new states are established, typically citizenship is extended to all those who were born in the territory of the new state or who were lawfully resident in that territory for a specified period before the establishment of the new state. Typically, nationality may also be acquired later in life through naturalization. Corporations, ships, and other legal persons also have a nationality, generally in the state under whose laws the legal person was formed. However, it is unclear whether the Sahrawi National Council has exercised any of its powers to make laws under Article 104 of the Sahrawi constitution. Because of this, it is not possible to determine with legal certainty who in fact is a Sahrawi citizen.\n\nSahrawi citizens enjoy a range of rights under the Sahrawi constitution such as those relating to participation in the political, economic and social life of SADR. Sahrawi citizens are also subject to a number of obligations, some of which reflect the particular circumstances of the Sahrawi Republic. The following obligations are imposed on Sahrawi citizens under Chapter Five of Sahrawi constitution:\n\nCitizens who are parents are also obliged to protect their families and their education while children must respect their parents.\n\nAmong the Western Saharan population there is a very significant number of people who have resettled in Western Sahara from Morocco (Moroccan settlers) or who were born in Western Sahara, the children of Moroccan settlers. Some estimate that Moroccan settlers and their descendants now constitute a majority of the Western Sahara population although estimates vary. For some years, the SADR government has stated that it is willing in principle to allow Moroccan settlers to vote in the long stalled United Nations (MINURSO) supervised referendum on Western Sahara independence or integration with Morocco.\n\nOn 10 April 2007, the Polisario Front - the government of SADR – presented its \"Proposal of the Polisario Front for a mutually acceptable political solution assuring the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara\". In the 2007 Proposal the Polisario Front went further to reassure Moroccan settlers that they will continue to have a future in Western Sahara if the proposed referendum takes place and results in Sahrawi independence. Paragraph 9 of the Proposal states that in the context of Sahrawi independence, the Sahrawi government would provide:\n\nIn the absence of a comprehensive Sahrawi nationality law, the citizenship of settlers who came from Morocco or the smaller number who came to Western Sahara when it was a Spanish colony and province - and indeed that of ethnic Sahrawis themselves will remain unclear.\n\nThe future status of Western Sahara remains the subject of UN sponsored negotiations between Morocco and the Polisario Front. Future developments in Sahrawi nationality law (and indeed its continued existence) may well be shaped by the outcome of those negotiations.\n\nIn March 2013, Hassan Serghouchni, an old Moroccan political prisoner in the 1980s residing in Oujda, sent a letter to the Sahrawi Republic embassy in Algiers asking for the concession of the Sahrawi nationality, being the first Moroccan to demand it. In October 2012 Serghouchni had renounced to the Moroccan nationality.\n\n"}

The states were borrowing to fund transportation investments as well as raising capital to start new banks. Northern states, such as Pennsylvania and Maryland, incurred debt through the building of canals to connect the Midwest to ports on the Atlantic Ocean. Midwest states, including Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Michigan, built railroads and canals throughout the region, while Southern States raised capital to fund new banks to improve a weakened banking system. The majority of state debt was owed to parties outside the U.S., primarily Europe. State debts were largely paid off in full by the late 1840s, although no direct sanctions were enacted to force repayment. The state bankruptcies led to The Bankruptcy Act of 1841, which was later repealed in 1843.\n\nThe years from 1834–1837 leading up to the State bankruptcies were inflationary until the Panic of 1837. Prices for cotton and other exports sent overseas were rising. Through trade and state-backed bonds, the United States had a strong inflow of capital from the Bank of England and other European parties. Large infrastructure investments were being made domestically with the excess inflow of monetary value to the U.S. Much of the westward expansion of the United States was brought about from overseas funding for railroads and canals. Increasing the efficiency of transportation made it easier for people to move away from the large ports on the East coast.\n\nPennsylvania and Maryland had viewed the success of the Erie Canal in connecting rural New York and the Midwest to the ports on the Atlantic Ocean. The investment in building a new canal was costly but well compensated in trade opportunities further down the road. Both Pennsylvania and Maryland began borrowing from European groups to fund the construction of similar transportation infrastructure. By 1841, Maryland had amassed a total debt of a little over $12 million with more than $11 million used for transportation purposes. Pennsylvania had a lower proportion of transportation to other uses debt ratio compared to Maryland but had a total debt that was nearly three times that of Maryland’s. Transportation investment debt reached over $30 million in Pennsylvania by 1841.\n\nThe Midwest states were also borrowing to increase transportation infrastructure, similar to the Northern States, but railroads were the prime mode of transportation in the Midwest in this period. Canals were also being established at this time. Nearly all of the Mid-western state debts were incurred for transportation uses. The Midwest states borrowed on a much smaller scale than Pennsylvania and Maryland, reaching about $37 million, total, between Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio.\n\nThe Southern states were much different in the means of borrowing compared to the rest of the nation. At the time, the Southern banking system was small and insignificant compared to that in the North. United States bonds were issued to both foreign and domestic parties to raise capital. The raised capital was used to fund new banks and to allow already established banks the capital to grow upon.\n\nIn 1836, the Bank of England decided to tighten the loaning of credit both domestically and to foreign parties to help increase dwindling reserves of monetary value held in the banks. Due to an open free trade economy domestic banks were forced to follow the interest rate changes made in England in fear of falling behind in competition. Demand for cotton plummeted, by early 1837 the price of cotton was down 25%. Much of the nation, especially the South, was heavily dependent on trade of agriculture. Unstable crop prices had devastating effects in the South at the time. Overall the tightening of credit had a widespread devastating effect in the United States because the infrastructure investment projects, brought about by large inflows of capital from Europe, were left unfinished and without further funding.\n\nThe tightening of credit from European parties led to many unfinished and unfunded infrastructure investment projects in the United States. Canals in Pennsylvania and Maryland were unfinished along with many railroads in the Midwest. Southern banks soon failed and bonds were unable to be paid back in full across the country.\n\nBoth Pennsylvania and Maryland borrowed heavily from European sources to fund canals connecting their ports to the Midwest and both could not make the interest payments early in the 1840s, due to the Panic of 1837, and had to declare bankruptcy. Both states were well populated and relatively wealthy for the time so after a few tries they were able to raise their taxes to a point sustainable and were able to continue payment on loans relatively quickly.\n\nThe Midwest states including Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan borrowed funds to build transportation infrastructure in the form of railroads and canals. With the tightening of funding from foreign sources most investment opportunities collapsed and only Ohio was able to avoid defaulting on loans. Indiana and Illinois were able to reach agreements with lenders to continue funding of the projects if payments were still met along with some speculations. Illinois deeded the Illinois and Michigan canal to their creditors as payment and Indiana agreed to pay half the debts while the Wabash and Erie canals were held in trust to pay the rest. Michigan followed similar procedures as Illinois and Indiana but agreements forced them to only pay a fraction of the total debts.\n\nMost Southern states felt similar effects causing bankruptcies in 1841. The many banks that had been established as a means of expanding Southern banking failed at an alarmingly high rate. Courts ruled that the states were not responsible for bonds issued to banks but were responsible for any bonds issued directly by the states. Many banks had large sums of debt and no way to pay for it. Quite often bonds issued and backed by banks were done outside of regulation standards giving banks a means to repudiate their debts. Debt repayment or repudiation was split among the states. Some states such as Louisiana and Arkansas liquidated the banks to pay off debts while states like Mississippi and Florida refused to pay their debts in full.\n\n"}

The centre and right-wing parties were in favour of the revision, which was undertaken to reduce the debt of the ALV, while the left-wing parties were against it.\n\nThe referendum was approved by 53.4% of voters, although only the German-speaking cantons (all of them except Basel-Stadt, which was against it with 50.4%) approved it.\n\nThe referendum held on 28 November had two issues:\n\n\nThe SVP's federal popular initiative on deportation was accepted with 52.2% and a majority of cantons in favour, while the counterproposal failed with only 44.5% in favour. Whilst it was not required, the tie-breaker showed a majority of voters against but a majority of cantons for. On February 28, 2016, a follow-up initiative, also launched by the SVP, was rejected by voters. The deportation initiative went in effect on October 1, 2016.\n\nThe taxation initiative failed with only 41.5% in favour.\n\nIn August 2010, family members of a murder victim launched another constitutional amendment initiative to provide for Capital punishment in cases of murder combined with sexual violence. The initiative quickly found itself at the center of public attention and was roundly rejected by political leaders; it was withdrawn a day after its official publication.\n"}

Comstock, 560 U.S. 126 (2010), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States, which held that the federal government has authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause to require the civil commitment of individuals already in Federal custody. The practice, introduced by the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, was upheld against a challenge that it fell outside the enumerated powers granted to Congress by the Constitution. The decision did not rule on any other aspect of the law's constitutionality, because only the particular issue of Congressional authority was properly before the Court.\n\nSix days before Graydon Earl Comstock was to have completed a 37-month sentence for receiving child pornography, Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales certified that Comstock was a sexually dangerous person. The law that Attorney General Gonzales was applying was ruled unconstitutional by lower courts on the grounds it exceeded Congress’s constitutional authority.\nArgued in January 2010 by Solicitor General Elena Kagan, the position of the United States was that the Necessary and Proper Clause gave Congress the power to enact the law.\n\nStephen Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court, which decided that the \"Necessary and Proper\" Clause permitted Congress to enact such a provision. John Roberts, John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Sonia Sotomayor joined Breyer's opinion. Anthony Kennedy and Samuel Alito filed opinions concurring in the judgment. Clarence Thomas filed a dissenting opinion in which Antonin Scalia joined in all but Part III– A–1–b.\n\nThe Court said: \"We base this conclusion on five considerations, taken together.\" The five considerations are as follows. \n\n"}
