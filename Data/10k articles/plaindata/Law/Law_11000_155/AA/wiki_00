The law took effect on January 1, 2005.\n\nThe legislature of California declared that \"proliferation and use\" of .50 BMG rifles posed a terrorist threat, as well as a threat to the \"health, safety, and security of all residents\" of California. The act required existing .50 BMG rifles to be registered with the state and prohibited the sale of any rifle after the ban went into effect. To quote the state web site, the act \"regulates the .50 BMG rifles in essentially the same manner as assault weapons.\" The law specifically allowed a registration period of one year, now passed, to register any such firearms, after which unregistered weapons would become illegal firearms.\n\n\"A .50 BMG rifle is defined as a centerfire rifle that can fire a .50 BMG cartridge and is not already an assault weapon ... or a machinegun\" \n“.50 BMG cartridge” is defined as a cartridge that is designed and intended to be fired from a centerfire rifle and that meets all of the following criteria: \n(1) It has an overall length of from the base to the tip of the bullet. \n(2) The bullet diameter for the cartridge is from .510 to, and including, . \n(3) The case base diameter for the cartridge is from to, and including, .804 inch. \nThe law does not apply to the law enforcement officers with permission from their employing agencies.\n\nExceptions are granted to rifles classified as antiques or Curio and Relics as defined by the BATFE.\n\nOut-of-state owners may bring .50 BMG rifles into the state for shooting competitions.\n\nLimited exceptions are granted for exhibitions, displays, and education projects sponsored by law enforcement or government agencies.\n\nAs a result of the ban, the Barrett Firearms Company announced it would no longer sell to or service any of its rifles in the possession of any California government agency.\n\nA 1999 Justice Department Office of Special Investigations briefing on .50 caliber rifle crime identified several instances of the .50 BMG being involved in criminal activities. Most of the instances of criminal activity cited in the Office of Special Investigations briefing involved the illegal possession of a .50 BMG rifle. The briefing did not identify any instance of a .50 BMG rifle being used in the commission of a murder.\n\nThe .510 DTC Europ has since been introduced to take advantage of the highly specific language used in the act. The round provides almost identical ballistics and performance, but cannot be used in weapons chambered for .50 BMG.\n\nBarrett has since produced the .416 Barrett, a necked-down .50 BMG case using a .416 caliber bullet, which is not subject to the .50 BMG Act because of the smaller caliber. It has the benefit of having a flatter trajectory than the .50 BMG.\n\n\n"}

It was adopted by delegates to a Constitutional Convention in February 1901, but the United States, then exercising military authority over Cuba following the end of Cuba's war for independence from Spain, withheld its approval until the Convention amended the Constitution in June to incorporate language from a U.S. statute, the Platt Amendment, that placed limitations on Cuban sovereignty and provided a legal basis for future U.S. military interventions in Cuba.\n\nGeneral Leonard Wood, the U.S. military governor of Cuba, called for a constitutional convention to meet in September 1900. It met for the first time on 5 November 1900, in Havana. Wood opened the meeting by charging its thirty-one delegates with writing a constitution and formulating the future relationship between the U.S. and Cuba. presided and Enrique Villuendas and Alfredo Zayas served as secretaries.\n\nThe convention's central committee produced a first draft of the constitution in January, and it failed to mention the United States. In early February the U.S. government expressed its displeasure at the Convention's failure to address the question of Cuban-American relations and its presumption that elections would occur 90 days after the constitution is adopted without giving any consideration, in the words of \"The New York Times\", \"as to whether the United States will be satisfied\" with the document. A spokesman for the McKinley administration said: \nThe convention approved the text of the constitution on 21 February 1901, without adopting the language the U.S. government was insisting on. Modeled on the U.S. Constitution (1789), it divided the government into three branches:\nThe constitution was not submitted to a popular vote. Some in the United States had objected that the document should be subject to popular ratification, both to remove any question that the United States had imposed it by manipulating the Convention delegates and also as a matter of principle: \"it is the privilege of the people to adopt or reject it; and it will not be securely ordained and established until it has been so adopted by the people\". Wood, however, had charged the Convention with writing and \"adopting\" a constitution. The Convention did that and, without holding a plebiscite, proceeded to establish procedures for elections to fill the offices established by the Constitution.\n\nThe Platt Amendment was a U.S. statute that authorized the U.S. president to withdraw troops from Cuba following the Spanish–American War once he secured several specific promises from Cuba by treaty. Five provisions set restrictions on Cuban sovereignty and governed relations between the U.S. and Cuba. A sixth declared sovereignty over the Isle of Pines off the coast of the island of Cuba a question to be settled by a later treaty. A seventh guaranteed the U.S. the right to lease land in Cuba to establish naval bases and coaling stations. An eighth required the earlier seven provisions to be agreed to by treaty.\n\nThe U.S. government attempted to win the adoption of the Platt Amendment's terms by the delegates of the Cuban Constitutional Convention by promising to guarantee Cuban sugar producers access to the U.S. market. The delegates repeatedly rejected the text or sought to find acceptable language to substitute. Wood negotiated with a committee tasked with crafting a text. When they adopted a constitution in February 1901 they failed to include any version of it.\n\nThe delegates tried to meet the U.S. demand by issuing an \"opinion\" on relations with the U.S., but remained in session anticipating it would not be sufficient. As of early April, in one observer's view, the delegates were divided between \"nationalist sentiment\" and the \"sober judgment\" that advised meeting the U.S. demands, and \"they continue to beat about the bush for some deliverance from their dilemma, all the time ... drifting slowly but sensible toward an acceptance of the terms of the Platt Amendment.\" A divided committee of delegates produced two more competing drafts in May. As late as 1 June 1901, the Convention adopted language that Wood warned would not be acceptable, and U.S. Secretary of State Elihu Root confirmed that rejection.\n\nThe delegates finally yielded to American pressure and ratified the Platt Amendment's provisions, first by accepting the report of its drafting committee on a 15 to 14 vote on 28 May, and then as an amendment to the constitution by a vote of 16 to 11 on 12 June 1901.\n\nThe United States transferred \"government and control\" to the government newly elected under the terms of the amended 1901 constitution on 20 May 1902.\n\nCuba removed the Platt Amendment provisions from its constitution on 29 May 1934, as part of a new understanding of relations with the United States under the Good Neighbor policy of the administration of Franklin Roosevelt. At the same time, Cuba and the U.S. replaced their 1903 Treaty of Relations that had committed both countries to the Platt Amendment's requirements. Their new 1934 Treaty of Relations preserved only two elements of the earlier pact: \n\nThe delegates to the Constitutional Convention that created the 1901 Constitution were:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2584929", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2584929", "title": "AM expanded band", "text": "AM expanded band\n\nThe extended mediumwave broadcast band, commonly known as the [AM] expanded band, is a broadcast frequency allocation. It moves the upper limit of the AM bandplan from 1605 to 1705 kHz. \n\nThe band became officially available around 1993, but only in ITU region 2 (the Americas). It is popular with micro-broadcasting for having less interference due to fewer signals than the standard/legacy AM band.\n\nThough supported on most modern AM radio receivers sold in the Americas, this band is usually unavailable to older receivers except for those with substantial extended coverage. In the U.S., coverage on newer radios is mandated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), invoking the All-Channel Receiver Act.\n\nThe band 1600-1700 kHz was originally designated as a police radio band. While police radio transmissions are no longer made on this band, a number of county and city ordinances forbid receivers capable of picking up transmissions on this band . While this ordinance is not normally enforced it can be and has been used to cite motorists in possession of amateur radio gear, or in extreme cases an AM radio installed in the vehicle as original equipment.\n\nIn the United States of America, the Federal Communications Commission voted to support an expanded band on April 12, 1990. The FCC granted \"stereo preferences\" to commercial broadcasters intending to use AM stereo when issuing licenses for the band. However, such stations have never been required to broadcast in stereo. With the content of the AM band evolving more toward talk radio than music, it is unlikely that the FCC would take any action against an extended-band station only broadcasting in monophonic sound.\n\nThe standard for FCC licensed expanded band stations has been to broadcast omnidirectionally with ten kilowatts of power in the daytime and one kilowatt at night—except for stations that use antennas with higher than normal efficiency or those multiplexed with an existing station on a different frequency. In those cases, they are, by FCC Part 73 rules, authorized for less than one kilowatt at night, generally limiting such stations to 281 millivolts per meter per kilowatt at one kilometer, the minimum efficiency for a Class B station. One station (KVNS 1700 kHz, licensed to Brownsville, Texas) operates at 12% less than the standard (8.8kW Day and 880 watts at night) due to treaty obligations with Mexico.\n\nBecause 1610 kHz (the top or right-most channel on analog radios) had previously been used for Travelers' Information Stations (TIS) as 530 kHz — the bottom or left-most channel — still is (though 530 is NOT an FCC U.S. AM Broadcast channel, some TIS stations were displaced for new expanded-band stations. There are no AM stations in the United States licensed to 1610 kHz \n\nWhile 1710 kHz appears on many radios, it is unused even by TIS stations, except for a group (WQFG689) licensed with a waiver to the County of Hudson in New Jersey. This is because TIS stations are authorized under Part 90 of the FCC rules which deal with all two-way radio [except marine (Part 80) and ham/amateur radio (Part 97)] and not Part 73 or 74 which are the broadcast rules.\n\nMexico has a total of four radio stations licensed for the expanded band: XEUT-AM 1630, XEARZ-AM 1650, XEANAH-AM 1670, and XEPE-AM 1700. XEARZ (5 kW) and XEPE (10 kW) operate with nighttime power greater than 1 kW. These stations were authorized before changes in 2014 set aside the AM expanded band, along with 106-108 MHz on FM, for social community and social indigenous radio stations.\n\nAlthough the extended band is not officially allocated in Europe, it is used by a number of \"hobby\" pirate radio stations, particularly in the Netherlands, Greece, and Serbia, and it was used in the past by Vatican Radio (on 1611kHz).\n\nIn Australia, many commercial radio broadcast licences have been authorised for the extended band.\n\nThe vast majority of licences have never been used. Due to a number of factors, few Australian stations in this band have many listeners.\n\nAM expanded band in Japan is up to 1629 kHz. 1620 kHz or 1629 kHz is normally used on Highway advisory radio and/or Roadside Station along stretches on major expressways in their country. Many Japanese AM radios can tune up to 1629 kHz, it can be found on Japanese car stereos and many radios, walkman, etc. 1611 kHz is rarely used in Japan, and it appeared on many Japanese radios.\n\nIn the Philippines, the first AM expanded band radio station in low power format broadcasting in Marikina City is DZBF DEL Radio - Radyo Marikina 1674 kHz started in July 25, 1996.\n\n"}

{"id": "3957598", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3957598", "title": "Austrian nationality law", "text": "Austrian nationality law\n\nNationality law (German: \"Staatsbürgerschaftsgesetz\") in the Republic of Austria is based on the principle of \"jus sanguinis\". In other words, one usually acquires Austrian citizenship if a parent is Austrian, irrespective of place of birth.\n\nDuring 1812–1918, citizenship in the Austrian Empire (after 1867 the Austro-Hungarian Empire) was regulated by the \"Allgemeines bürgerliches Gesetzbuch\" (ABGB) (§§ 28–30). The system of \"Heimatrecht\" was introduced in 1859, defining citizenship at the municipal level: \"Heimatrecht\" in a given municipality guaranteed the right of residence in that municipality and social support for destitute individuals. Suffrage (election of the Imperial Council) for all male citizens with \"Heimatrecht\" was introduced in 1906.\nFrom 1863, municipalities were obliged to keep a record (\"Heimatrolle\") of all citizens. Most citizens would be registered as members of a parish of the Catholic Church (\"Pfarrmatrikel\"); for non-Catholics, a separate register (\"Zivilmatrikel\") was introduced in 1870. Citizenship was granted based on either descent or marriage, or via naturalization after ten years of residence (or on the acquisition of an official function). Citizenship could also be retracted in the case of an absence of longer than two years. By a principle of subsidiarity, citizenship in a municipality implied citizenship in the Crown land of that municipality.\nGeneral \"Austrian citizenship\" (\"allgemeines österreichisches Staatsbürgerrecht\") for all Cisleithanian Crown lands represented in the Imperial Council was introduced in 1867, with a separate \"Hungarian citizenship\" recognized for the lands of the Hungarian Crown.\n\nThe First Austrian Republic recognized all citizens of Republic of German-Austria as Austrian citizens, effective 13 December 1918.\nAlso recognized as citizens were all individuals with permanent residence in the territory of German-Austria since at least 1914. Individuals with Austrian citizenship outside of German-Austria (with the exception of Galicia, Dalmatia and Istria) were given the right to declare themselves German-Austrians and so receive citizenship.\nThe new constitution of 1920 introduced the system of States (\"Bundesländer\"). Nationality law was now handled at the State level (\"Landesbürgerschaft\"), still tied to municipal citizenship (\"Heimatrecht\") via the subsidiarity principle. A new nationality passed in 1925 permitted naturalization following a period of permanent residence of at least four years. \n\nBetween 13 March 1938 and 27 April 1945, Austria was part of Germany, and German nationality law applied. Those acquiring Austrian citizenship upon the establishment of the Second Austrian Republic in 1945 generally lost German citizenship on that date. \n\nThe Republic of Austria was established in 1955, and the current nationality law was originally passed in 1965, and renewed in 1985 to reflect gender equality, introducing perfect symmetry for the acquisition of nationality via marriage by either partner. The law has been updated several times, in 1986, 1988, 1993, 1994, 1997,1998, 2006 and 2013.\n\nBirth in Austria does not in itself confer Austrian citizenship. However it may lead to a reduction in the residence requirement for naturalisation as an Austrian citizen. Foundlings under the age of 6 months are legally presumed to have Austrian citizenship.\n\nA child born to two Austrian parents is an Austrian citizen, regardless of the parents' marital status.\n\nIf the parents are married at the time of birth, Austrian citizenship of either the mother or the father is sufficient, so long as the child was born after 1 September 1983. For children born prior to that date, the father must have been an Austrian citizen: children born to an Austrian mother married to a non-Austrian father do not qualify.\n\nIf the parents are not married, a mother automatically passes on Austrian citizenship. A father passes on citizenship if he acknowledges paternity or a court does so within eight weeks of the birth. Should the parents marry at some time after the birth, citizenship is automatically granted to the child retroactively. If the child is over 14 at that time, however, the child's consent is needed.\n\nIt is possible to apply for Austrian citizenship by naturalization generally after 10 years of continuous residence in Austria.\nHowever in certain cases it is possible to apply earlier.\n\nAdditional requirements include:\n\nThis requirement can be waived in exceptional cases.\n\nNaturalization as an Austrian citizen based on 10 years of continuous residence is discretionary.\n\nThe residence requirement may be reduced or waived in the following cases:\n\n\nSome persons are entitled to Austrian citizenship by a simpler process than naturalization.\n\nMinor children of a person granted Austrian citizenship are most often granted Austrian citizenship as well.\n\n\nThis is so far the most restrictive law among all the European Union member countries about the foreign spouses obtaining the member state's citizenship.\n\nA person who has lived in Austria for 30 years, or 15 years in cases of 'sustained personal and occupational integration', is entitled to grant of Austrian citizenship.\n\n\nA stateless person born in Austria may be granted Austrian citizenship within two years of age 18 if he has lived in Austria for a total of 10 years, including 5 years continuously before application.\n\nAs a result of the fact that appointment to a professorship at an Austrian university or other institute of higher learning entailed being named a state official before the year 2001 , foreign citizens formerly received Austrian citizenship immediately when they took office, without additionally applying for citizenship, or being compelled to do so .\n\nAustria's entry into the European Union meant that citizens of other member countries now enjoyed the same rights to access to employment as Austrians (as a consequence of broader European integration). This meant that the automatic conferment of citizenship on professors was valid only for citizens of non-EU states . However, since September 1, 2001, postings for university professorships are to be advertised exclusively as private-sector employment . Therefore, the requirement of automatic conferment of citizenship on foreign-nationals named to professorships (as found in § 25 Abs. 1 StbG) was rendered obsolete. This article was therefore determined to be no longer valid by the First Federal Constitutional Cleanup Law (Erste Bundesverfassungsrechtsbereinigungsgesetz) of January 4, 2008. \n\nThe regulation for professors (Dienstantritt als Universitätsprofessor, § 25 Abs. 1) was thereby abolished by the revision of the law in 2008. \n\nFurthermore, spouses and minor unmarried children of those professors who were still named state officials previously also received Austrian citizenship (§ 25 Abs. 2 and 3) by declaring, within one year of the spouse's/parent's acceptance as a citizen, \"a desire to be a loyal citizen of the Republic\". In this special case of naturalization, dual citizenship was permitted. A parliamentary survey on the number of people naturalized in this fashion showed that there had been no statistics collected on this point.\n\nAn Austrian citizen who acquires another citizenship by voluntary action automatically loses Austrian citizenship. The exception is in cases where permission to retain Austrian citizenship has been obtained in advance. This may be difficult to obtain, as the aim of the lawgiver is to reduce the number of dual citizenships granted. Exceptions are made for situations where it is in the interest of the Republic of Austria to grant this dual citizenship (e.g. when somebody is a celebrity in arts, sports, science, economy etc.), or in situations where the citizen would suffer hardship due to not having the second citizenship. If, for example, an Austrian citizen wants to obtain U.S. citizenship because he/she lives in the U.S. and, without a U.S. citizenship, would lose their green card due to being made to travel more than 180 days per year by their employer, then if they apply for permission to retain Austrian citizenship, that request is usually granted and has become almost a formality.\n\nThe important part is that the application to retain Austrian citizenship is made \"before\" acquiring another citizenship. Otherwise the Austrian citizenship is automatically lost the moment a person obtains a foreign citizenship. The law can change at any time, however, especially should the power in the Austrian parliament shift dramatically after an election and a party opposed to the current law regains absolute majority.\n\nAustrian citizenship is also automatically lost by serving in a foreign army.\n\nRestoration of lost Austrian citizenship to Holocaust survivors and their descendants\nThere are also provisions for Austrian Jews whose Austrian citizenship was revoked by decree of the Nazi regime and their descendants to regain Austrian citizenship despite having become citizens of another country.\n\nAustrian law substantially restricts dual citizenship. In general, only the following categories of Austrian citizens may possess a foreign nationality:\n\nBecause Austria forms part of the European Union, Austrian citizens are also citizens of the European Union under European Union law and thus enjoy rights of free movement and have the right to vote in elections for the European Parliament. When in a non-EU country where there is no Austrian embassy, Austrian citizens have the right to get consular protection from the embassy of any other EU country present in that country. Austrian citizens can live and work in any country within the EU as a result of the right of free movement and residence granted in Article 21 of the EU Treaty.\n\nVisa requirements for Austrian citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of Austria. In 2017, Austrian citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 173 countries and territories, ranking the Austrian passport 4th in terms of travel freedom (tied with Belgian, British, Dutch, French, Luxembourgish, Norwegian and Singaporean passports) according to the Henley visa restrictions index.\n\nThe Austrian nationality is ranked tenth in Nationality Index (QNI). This index differs from the Visa Restrictions Index, which focuses on external factors including travel freedom. The QNI considers, in addition, to travel freedom on internal factors such as peace & stability, economic strength, and human development as well. \n\n"}

Ligachev was at the time a member of the Politburo, while Yeltsin was First Deputy Chairman of the Soviet State Committee for Construction. Speaking at the 19th All-Union Conference of the CPSU, Ligachev said: \"Dear comrades! We should not be silent because communist Yeltsin has chosen a wrong path.

They are reserved for use by companies and individuals operating commercial activities; educational, philanthropic, or ecclesiastical institutions; clergy activities or hospitals, clinics, or medical associations. In the United States, use of these frequencies requires a license issued by the U.S. FCC. The exceptions to this are five specific frequencies that are also part of the Multi-Use Radio Service, which permits unlicensed operation on these frequencies, provided the output power does not exceed 2 watts. There are also other frequencies such as citizen's band and Family Radio Service that may be used without a license.\n\nChannels are available in several frequency ranges to suit the users' requirements for propagation and protection from interference. The electromagnetic spectrum between approximately 450 and 470 MHz is used largely for UHF business communications, although this spectrum is not exclusively for business use. In some large metropolitan areas, such as New York, the UHF-T band (between 470 and 512 MHz) is also used, due to congestion on the standard VHF or UHF bands. There are also a number of specific frequencies, in both the VHF and UHF spectrum, that are for business use; some of these have color-coded names, such as Blue Dot or Red Star.\n\nIn 2004, the FCC required all CFR 47 Part 90 VHF (150–174 MHz) and UHF (421–470 MHz) PLMR (Private Land Mobile Radio) licensees operating legacy wideband (25 kHz bandwidth) voice or data/SCADA systems to migrate to narrowband (12.5 kHz bandwidth or equivalent) systems] by January 1, 2013.\n\nThe Private Land Mobile Radio Service (47CFR90, or Part 90 of the FCC Rules) was established in the US in 1927 to permit commercial and public safety uses of two-way radio by commercial entities and non-Federal government agencies. Similar allocations are available in other countries. The available frequencies in the US have traditionally been separated into two pools. One is for industrial and business users, including some special categories such as petroleum, manufacturing and forestry; the other is for public safety including medical, police, fire and others. The industrial and business frequencies, sometimes also known as \"business band radio\" and the eligibility requirements are listed in 47CFR90.35. Frequencies are licensed on a non-exclusive basis, although fixed stations and mobiles operating in a defined area are issued licenses only following frequency coordination to assure equitable sharing of bandwidth. Anyone conducting commercial business or a number of other activities is eligible for a license.\n\nOther general-purpose two-way radio services with simplified licensing requirements have also been established over the years in the US including GMRS and citizen's band, the latter now being licensed by rule, so that users don't need individual licenses. FRS and MURS are similar pools of frequencies that do not require individual licenses in the USA. There is a similar group of low power, unlicensed two-way frequencies in other countries, such as PMR in Europe and UHF CB in Australia.\n\nAlthough the term \"business band\" refers to several discrete frequencies that are not grouped into a single band, examples of some of the frequencies are grouped by band and listed below. These charts also list other frequencies not specifically part of the \"business band\" but commonly used by businesses. An individual license is still required under GMRS rules. A few manufacturers added these DOT frequencies to Business radios in the 1990s to have more \"channels\" and aid in selling radios. Part 90 (Business) and Part 95 (GMRS) frequencies are not interchangeable and are not to be used under the same guidelines. Each has different criteria for licensing. Part 95 GMRS frequencies are not \"Itinerant\", nor business band frequencies.\n\n"}

The tax rate depends on both the investor's tax bracket and the amount of time the investment was held. Short-term capital gains are taxed at the investor's ordinary income tax rate and are defined as investments held for a year or less before being sold. Long-term capital gains, on dispositions of assets held for more than one year, are taxed at a lower rate.\n\nThe United States taxes short-term capital gains at the same rate as it taxes ordinary income. \n\nLong-term capital gains are taxed at lower rates shown in the table below. (Qualified dividends receive the same preference.)\n\nSeparately, the tax on collectibles and certain small business stock is capped at 28%. The tax on unrecaptured Section 1250 gain — the portion of gains on depreciable real estate (structures used for business purposes) that has been or could have been claimed as depreciation — is capped at 25%.\n\nThe income amounts (\"tax brackets\") were reset by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 for the 2018 tax year to equal the amount that would have been due under prior law. They will be adjusted each year based on the Chained CPI measure of inflation. These income amounts are after deductions: There is another bracket, of income below that shown as $0 in the table, on which no tax is due. For 2018, this amount is at least the standard deduction, $12,000 for an individual return and $24,000 for a joint return, or more if the taxpayer has over that amount in itemized deductions.\n\nThere may be taxes in addition to the tax rates shown in the above table.\n\nCapital gains do not push ordinary income into a higher income bracket. The Capital Gains and Qualified Dividends Worksheet in the Form 1040 instructions specifies a calculation that treats both long-term capital gains and qualified dividends as though they were the last income received, then applies the preferential tax rate as shown in the above table.\n\nThe capital gain that is taxed is the excess of the sale price over the cost basis of the asset. The taxpayer reduces the sale price and increases the cost basis (reducing the capital gain on which tax is due) to reflect transaction costs such as brokerage fees, certain legal fees, and the transaction tax on sales.\n\nIn contrast, when a business is entitled to a depreciation deduction on an asset used in the business (such as for each year's wear on a piece of machinery), it reduces the cost basis of that asset by that amount, potentially to zero. The reduction in basis occurs whether or not the business claims the depreciation.\n\nIf the business then sells the asset for a gain (that is, for more than its adjusted cost basis), this part of the gain is called depreciation recapture. When selling certain real estate, it may be treated as capital gain. When selling equipment, however, depreciation recapture is generally taxed as ordinary income, not capital gain. Further, when selling some kinds of assets, none of the gain qualifies as capital gain.\n\nIf a business develops and sells properties, gains are taxed as business income rather than investment income. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, in \"Byram v. United States\" (1983), set out criteria for making this decision and determining whether income qualifies for treatment as a capital gain.\n\nUnder the stepped-up basis rule, for an individual who inherits a capital asset, the cost basis is \"stepped up\" to its fair market value of the property at the time of the inheritance. When eventually sold, the capital gain or loss is only the difference in value from this stepped-up basis. Increase in value that occurred before the inheritance (such as during the life of the decedent) is never taxed.\n\nIf a taxpayer realizes both capital gains and capital losses in the same year, the losses offset (cancel out) the gains. The amount remaining after offsetting is the net gain or net loss used in the calculation of taxable gains.\n\nFor individuals, a net loss can be claimed as a tax deduction against ordinary income, up to $3,000 per year ($1,500 in the case of a married individual filing separately). Any remaining net loss can be carried over and applied against gains in future years. However, losses from the sale of personal property, including a residence, do not qualify for this treatment.\n\nCorporations with net losses of any size can re-file their tax forms for the previous three years and use the losses to offset gains reported in those years. This results in a refund of capital gains taxes paid previously. After the carryback, a corporation can carry any unused portion of the loss forward for five years to offset future gains.\n\nCorporations may declare that a payment to shareholders is a return of capital rather than a dividend. Dividends are taxable in the year that they are paid, while returns of capital work by decreasing the cost basis by the amount of the payment, and thus increasing the shareholder's eventual capital gain. Although most qualified dividends receive the same favorable tax treatment as long-term capital gains, the shareholder can defer taxation of a return of capital indefinitely by declining to sell the stock.\n\nFrom 1913 to 1921, capital gains were taxed at ordinary rates, initially up to a maximum rate of 7%. The Revenue Act of 1921 allowed a tax rate of 12.5% gain for assets held at least two years. From 1934 to 1941, taxpayers could exclude from taxation up to 70% of gains on assets held 1, 2, 5, and 10 years. Beginning in 1942, taxpayers could exclude 50% of capital gains on assets held at least six months or elect a 25% alternative tax rate if their ordinary tax rate exceeded 50%. From 1954 to 1967, the maximum capital gains tax rate was 25%. Capital gains tax rates were significantly increased in the 1969 and 1976 Tax Reform Acts. In 1978, Congress eliminated the minimum tax on excluded gains and increased the exclusion to 60%, reducing the maximum rate to 28%. The 1981 tax rate reductions further reduced capital gains rates to a maximum of 20%.\n\nThe Tax Reform Act of 1986 repealed the exclusion of long-term gains, raising the maximum rate to 28% (33% for taxpayers subject to phaseouts). The 1990 and 1993 budget acts increased ordinary tax rates but re-established a lower rate of 28% for long-term gains, though effective tax rates sometimes exceeded 28% because of other tax provisions. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 reduced capital gains tax rates to 10% and 20% and created the exclusion for one's primary residence. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 reduced them further, to 8% and 18%, for assets held for five years or more. The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 reduced the rates to 5% and 15%, and extended the preferential treatment to qualified dividends.\n\nThe 15% tax rate was extended through 2010 as a result of the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005, then through 2012. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 made qualified dividends a permanent part of the tax code but added a 20% rate on income in the new, highest tax bracket.\n\nThe Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 caused the IRS to introduce Form 8949, and radically change Form 1099-B, so that brokers would report not just the amounts of sales proceeds but purchases to the IRS, enabling the IRS to verify reported capital gains.\n\nThe Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 exempted taxes on capital gains for angel and venture capital investors on small business stock investments if held for 5 years. It was a temporary measure but was extended through 2011 by the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 as a jobs stimulus.\n\nIn 2013, provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"Obama-care\") took effect that imposed the Medicare tax of 3.8% (formerly a payroll tax) on capital gains of high-income taxpayers.\n\nFrom 1998 through 2017, tax law keyed the tax rate for long-term capital gains to the taxpayer's tax bracket for ordinary income, and set forth a lower rate for the capital gains. (Short-term capital gains have been taxed at the same rate as ordinary income for this entire period.) This approach was dropped by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, starting with tax year 2018.\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> This rate was reduced one-half percentage point for 2001 and one-half percentage point for 2002 and beyond.<br>\n<nowiki>**</nowiki> There was a two percentage point reduction for capital gains from certain assets held for more than five years, resulting in 8% and 18% rates.<br>\n<nowiki>***</nowiki> The gain may also be subject to the 3.8% Medicare tax.\n\nCapital gains taxes are disproportionately paid by high-income households, since they are more likely to own assets that generate the taxable gains. While this supports the argument that payers of capital gains taxes have more \"ability to pay,\"\nit also means that the payers are especially able to defer or avoid the tax, as it only comes due if and when the owner sells the asset. The disproportionate incidence on high-income households means that most debate on tax rates is partisan. The Republican Party favors lower rates, whereas the Democratic Party favors higher rates.\n\nEven though the incidence of the tax is on high-income taxpayers, low-income taxpayers who do not file capital gains taxes may wind up paying them through changed prices as the actual payers pass through the cost of paying the tax. Another factor complicating the use of capital gains taxes to address income inequality is that capital gains are usually not recurring income. A taxpayer may be \"high-income\" in the single year in which he or she sells an asset or invention.\n\nThe existence of the capital gains tax is controversial on partisan grounds. In 1995, to support the Contract with America legislative program of House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Stephen Moore and John Silvia wrote a study for the Cato Institute. In the study, they proposed halving of capital gains taxes, arguing that this move would \"substantially raise tax collections and increase tax payments by the rich\" and that it would increase economic growth and job creation. They wrote that the tax \"is so economically inefficient...that the optimal economic policy...would be to abolish the tax entirely.\"\nMore recently, Moore has written that the capital gains tax constitutes double taxation. \"First, most capital gains come from the sale of financial assets like stock. But publicly held companies have to pay corporate income tax...Capital gains is a second tax on that income when the stock is sold.\"\n\nRichard Epstein says that the capital-gains tax \"slows down the shift in wealth from less to more productive uses\" by imposing a cost on the decision to shift assets. He favors repeal or a rollover provision to defer the tax on gains that are reinvested.\n\nThe fact that the long-term capital gains rate is lower than the rate on ordinary income is regarded by the political left, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders, as a \"tax break\" that excuses investors from paying their \"fair share.\" The tax benefit for a long-term capital gain is sometimes referred to as a \"tax expenditure\" that government could elect to stop spending. By contrast, Republicans favor lowering the capital gain tax rate as an inducement to saving and investment. Also, the lower rate partly compensates for the fact that some capital gains are illusory and reflect nothing but inflation between the time the asset is bought and the time it is sold. Moore writes, \"when inflation is high...the tax rate can even rise above 100 percent\", as when a taxpayer owes tax on a capital gain that does not result in any increase in real wealth.\n\nThe one-year threshold between short-term and long-term capital gains is arbitrary and has changed over time. Short-term gains are disparaged as speculation and are perceived as self-interested, myopic, and destabilizing, while long-term gains are characterized as investment, which supposedly reflects a more stable commitment that is in the nation's interest. Others call this a false dichotomy.\nThe holding period to qualify for favorable tax treatment has varied from six months to ten years (see History above). There was special treatment of assets held for five years during the Presidency of George W. Bush. In her 2016 Presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton advocated holding periods of up to six years with a sliding scale of tax rates.\n\nCarried interest is the share of any profits that the general partners of private equity funds receive as compensation, despite not contributing any initial funds. The manager may also receive compensation that is a percentage of the assets under management.\nTax law provides that when such managers take, as a fee, a portion of the gain realized in connection with the investments they manage, the manager's gain is afforded the same tax treatment as the client's gain. Thus, where the client realizes long-term capital gains, the manager's gain is a long-term capital gain—generally resulting in a lower tax rate for the manager than would be the case if the manager's income were not treated as a long-term capital gain. Under this treatment, the tax on a long-term gain does not depend on how investors and managers divide the gain.\n\nThis tax treatment is often called the \"hedge-fund loophole\", even though it is private equity funds that benefit from the treatment; hedge funds usually do not have long-term gains. It has been criticized as \"indefensible\" and a \"gross unfairness\", because it taxes management services at a preferential rate intended for long-term gains. Warren Buffett has used the term \"coddling the super rich\". One counterargument is that the preferential rate is warranted because a grant of carried interest is often deferred and contingent, making it less reliable than a regular salary.\n\nThe 2017 tax reform established a three-year holding period for these fund managers to qualify for the long-term capital-gains preference.\n\nThe capital gains tax raises money for government but penalizes investment (by reducing the final rate of return). Proposals to change the tax rate from the current rate are accompanied by predictions on how it will affect both results. For example, an increase of the tax rate would be more of a disincentive to invest in assets, but would seem to raise more money for government. However, the Laffer curve suggests that the revenue increase might not be linear and might even be a decrease, as Laffer's \"economic effect\" begins to outweigh the \"arithmetic effect.\" For example, a 10% rate increase (such as from 20% to 22%) might raise less than 10% additional tax revenue by inhibiting some transactions. Laffer postulated that a 100% tax rate results in no tax revenue.\n\nAnother economic effect that might make receipts differ from those predicted is that the United States competes for capital with other countries. A change in the capital gains rate could attract more foreign investment, or drive United States investors to invest abroad.\n\nCongress sometimes directs the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to estimate the effects of a bill to change the tax code. It is contentious on partisan grounds whether to direct the CBO to use dynamic scoring (to include economic effects), or static scoring that does not consider the bill's effect on the incentives of taxpayers. After failing to enact the Budget and Accounting Transparency Act of 2014, Republicans mandated dynamic scoring in a rule change at the start of 2015, to apply to the Fiscal Year 2016 and subsequent budgets.\n\nSupporters of cuts in capital gains tax rates may argue that the current rate is on the falling side of the Laffer curve (past a point of diminishing returns) — that it is so high that its disincentive effect is dominant, and thus that a rate cut would \"pay for itself.\" Opponents of cutting the capital gains tax rate argue the correlation between top tax rate and total economic growth is inconclusive.\n\nMark LaRochelle wrote on the conservative website \"Human Events\" that cutting the capital gains rate increases employment. He presented a U.S. Treasury chart to assert that \"in general, capital gains taxes and GDP have an inverse relationship: when the rate goes up, the economy goes down\". He also cited statistical correlation based on tax rate changes during the presidencies of George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Ronald Reagan.\nHowever, comparing capital gains tax rates and economic growth in America from 1950 to 2011, Brookings Institution economist Leonard Burman found \"no statistically significant correlation between the two\", even after using \"lag times of five years.\" Burman's data are shown in the chart at right.\n\nEconomist Thomas L. Hungerford of the liberal Economic Policy Institute found \"little or even a negative\" correlation between capital gains tax reduction and rates of saving and investment, writing: \"Saving rates have fallen over the past 30 years while the capital gains tax rate has fallen from 28% in 1987 to 15% today ... This suggests that changing capital gains tax rates have had little effect on private saving\". Hungerford also studied top marginal tax rates from 1945 to 2010 and likewise found no correlation with saving, investment and productivity growth.\n\nResearchers usually use the top marginal tax rate to characterize policy as high-tax or low-tax. This figure measures the disincentive on the largest transactions per additional dollar of taxable income. However, this might not tell the complete story. The table Summary of recent history above shows that, although the marginal rate is higher now than at any time since 1998, there is also a substantial bracket on which the tax rate is 0%.\n\nAnother reason it is hard to prove correlation between the top capital gains rate and total economic output is that changes to the capital gains rate do not occur in isolation, but as part of a tax reform package. They may be accompanied by other measures to boost investment, and Congressional consensus to do so may derive from an economic shock, from which the economy may have been recovering independent of tax reform. A reform package may include increases and decreases in tax rates; the Tax Reform Act of 1986 increased the top capital gains rate, from 20% to 28%, as a compromise for reducing the top rate on ordinary income from 50% to 28%.\n\nThe ability to use capital losses to offset capital gains in the same year is discussed above. Toward the end of a tax year, some investors sell assets that are worth less than the investor paid for them to obtain this tax benefit.\n\nA wash sale, in which the investor sells an asset and buys it (or a similar asset) right back, cannot be treated as a loss at all, although there are other potential tax benefits as consolation.\n\nIn January, a new tax year begins; if stock prices increase, analysts may attribute the increase to an absence of such end-of-year selling and say there is a January effect. A Santa Claus rally is an increase in stock prices at the end of the year, perhaps in anticipation of a January effect.\n\nA taxpayer can designate that a sale of corporate stock corresponds to a specified purchase. For example, the taxpayer holding 500 shares may have bought 100 shares each on five occasions, probably at a different price each time. The individual lots of 100 shares are typically not held separate; even in the days of physical stock certificates, there was no indication which stock was bought when. If the taxpayer sells 100 shares, then by designating which of the five lots is being sold, the taxpayer will realize one of five different capital gains or losses. The taxpayer can maximize or minimize the gain depending on an overall strategy, such as generating losses to offset gains, or keeping the total in the range that is taxed at a lower rate or not at all.\n\nTo use this strategy, the taxpayer must specify \"at the time of a sale\" which lot is being sold (creating a \"contemporaneous record\"). This \"versus purchase\" sale is versus (against) a specified purchase. On brokerage websites, a \"Lot Selector\" may let the taxpayer specify the purchase to which a sell order corresponds.\n\nSection 121 lets an individual exclude from gross income up to $250,000 ($500,000 for a married couple filing jointly) of gains on the sale of real property if the owner owned and used it as primary residence for two of the five years before the date of sale. The two years of residency do not have to be continuous. An individual may meet the ownership and use tests during different 2-year periods. A taxpayer can move and claim the primary-residence exclusion every two years if living in an area where home prices are rising rapidly.\n\nThe tests may be waived for military service, disability, partial residence, unforeseen events, and other reasons. Moving to shorten one's commute to a new job is not an unforeseen event. Bankruptcy of an employer that induces a move to a different city is likely an unforeseen event, but the exclusion will be pro-rated if one has stayed in the home less than two years.\n\nThe amount of this exclusion is not increased for home ownership beyond five years. One is not able to deduct a loss on the sale of one's home.\n\nThe exclusion is also pro-rated if there is a portion of the ownership period in which the home was not the principal residence of the taxpayer, spouse, or ex-spouse.\n\nTaxpayers can defer capital gains taxes to a future tax year using the following strategies:\n\nIn 2011, President Barack Obama signed Executive Order 13531 establishing the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform (the \"Simpson-Bowles Commission\") to identify \"policies to improve the fiscal situation in the medium term and to achieve fiscal sustainability over the long run\". The Commission's final report took the same approach as the 1986 reform: eliminate the preferential tax rate for long-term capital gains in exchange for a lower top rate on ordinary income.\n\nThe tax change proposals made by the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform were never introduced. Republicans supported the proposed fiscal policy changes, yet Obama failed to garner support among fellow Democrats; During the 2012 election, presidential candidate Mitt Romney faulted Obama for \"missing the bus\" on his own Commission.\n\nTax policy was a part of the 2016 presidential campaign, as candidates proposed changes to the tax code that affect the capital gains tax.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's main proposed change to the capital gains tax was to repeal the 3.8% Medicare surtax that took effect in 2013. He also proposed to repeal the Alternative Minimum Tax, which would reduce tax liability for taxpayers with large incomes including capital gains. His maximum tax rate of 15% on businesses could result in lower capital gains taxes. However, as well as lowering tax rates on ordinary income, he would lower the dollar amounts for the remaining tax brackets, which would subject more individual capital gains to the top (20%) tax rate. Other Republican candidates proposed to lower the capital gains tax (Ted Cruz proposed a 10% rate), or eliminate it entirely (such as Marco Rubio).\n\nDemocratic nominee Hillary Clinton proposed to increase the capital gains tax rate for high-income taxpayers by \"creating several new, higher ordinary rates\", and proposed a sliding scale for long-term capital gains, based on the time the asset was owned, up to 6 years. Gains on assets held from one to two years would be reclassified short-term and taxed as ordinary income, at an effective rate of up to 43.4%, and long-term assets not held for a full 6 years would also be taxed at a higher rate. Clinton also proposed to treat carried interest (see above) as ordinary income, increasing the tax on it, to impose a tax on \"high-frequency\" trading, and to take other steps. Bernie Sanders proposed to treat many capital gains as ordinary income, and increase the Medicare surtax to 6%, resulting in a top effective rate of 60% on some capital gains.\n\nThe Republican Party introduced the American Health Care Act (House Bill 1628), which would amend the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"ACA\" or \"Obamacare\") to repeal the 3.8% tax on all investment income for high-income taxpayers and the 2.5% \"shared responsibility payment\" (\"individual mandate\") for taxpayers who do not have an acceptable insurance policy, which applies to capital gains. The House passed this bill but the Senate did not.\n\nHouse Bill 1 (the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017) was released on November 2, 2017 by Chairman Kevin Brady of the House Ways and Means Committee. Its treatment of capital gains was comparable to current law, but it roughly doubled the standard deduction, while dropping personal exemptions in favor of a larger child tax credit. The tax brackets continued to be inflation-adjusted, but used the stingier Chained CPI as the measurement of inflation. President Trump and Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas advocated using the bill to also repeal the shared responsibility payment, but Rep. Brady believed it would complicate passage of the bill. The House passed H.B. 1 on November 16.\n\nThe Senate version of H.B. 1 passed on December 2. Its capital gains tax brackets were only slightly different from those of the House version. It zeroed out the shared responsibility payment, but only beginning in 2019. Attempts to repeal \"versus purchase\" sales of stock (see above), and to make it harder to exclude gains on the sale of one's personal residence, did not survive the conference committee. Regarding \"carried interest\" (see above), the conference committee raised the holding period from one year to three to qualify for long-term capital-gains treatment.\n\nThe tax bills were \"scored\" to ensure their cost in lower government revenue was small enough to qualify under the Senate's reconciliation procedure. The law required this to use dynamic scoring (see above), but Larry Kudlow claimed that the scoring underestimated economic incentives and inflow of capital from abroad. To improve the scoring, changes to the personal income tax expired at the end of 2025.\n\nBoth houses of Congress passed H.B. 1 on December 20 and President Trump signed it into law on December 22.\n\nOn March 13, 2018, Trump appointed Kudlow the assistant to the President for Economic Policy and Director of the National Economic Council, replacing Gary Cohn, effective April 2. Kudlow supports indexing the cost basis of taxable investments to avoid taxing gains that are merely the result of inflation, and has recently suggested that the law allows Trump to direct the IRS to do so without a vote of Congress. The Treasury confirmed it was investigating the idea, but a lead Democrat said it would be “legally dubious” and meet with “stiff and vocal opposition”.\n\nTrump and Kudlow both announced a \"phase two\" of tax reform, suggesting a new bill that included a lower capital gains rate. However, prospects for a follow-on tax bill looked dim after the Democratic Party took the House of Representatives in the 2018 elections.\n\n"}
{"id": "2589430", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2589430", "title": "Citizen suit", "text": "Citizen suit\n\nIn the United States, a citizen suit is a lawsuit by a private citizen to enforce a statute. Citizen suits are particularly common in the field of environmental law.\n\nCitizen suits come in three forms. First, a private citizen can bring a lawsuit against a citizen, corporation, or government body for engaging in conduct prohibited by the statute. For example, a citizen can sue a corporation under the Clean Water Act (CWA) for illegally polluting a waterway. Second, a private citizen can bring a lawsuit against a government body for failing to perform a non-discretionary duty. For example, a private citizen could sue the Environmental Protection Agency for failing to promulgate regulations that the CWA required it to promulgate. In a third, less common form, citizens may sue for an injunction to abate a potential imminent and substantial endangerment involving generation, disposal or handling of waste, regardless of whether or not the defendant's conduct violates a statutory prohibition. This third type of citizen suit is analogous to the common law tort of public nuisance. In general, the law entitles plaintiffs who bring successful citizen suits to recover reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs.\n\nIn 1970, when amending the Clean Air Act, the United States Congress was inspired by similar legislation in the civil rights arena to begin including specific provisions for citizens to bring suit against violators or government agencies to enforce environmental laws. Today, most anti-pollution laws have provisions for citizen suits and they have become a major means of ensuring compliance with environmental laws. Public-interest environmental legal service organizations, such as Earthjustice and the Tulane Environmental Law Clinic, often prosecute citizen suits. Some non-environmental statutes, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Fair Housing Amendments Act, also contain citizen suit provisions, but the majority of regulatory statutes do not. \n\nCitizens may only bring citizen suits in federal court if they have \"standing to sue\". To establish standing, the courts have required proof of three elements. First, the plaintiff must have suffered an “injury in fact”—an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) “actual or imminent, not ‘conjectural’ or ‘hypothetical’”. Second, there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of—the injury has to be “fairly ... trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant, and not ... th[e] result [of] the independent action of some third party not before the court.” Third, it must be “likely”, as opposed to merely “speculative”, that the injury will be “redressed by a favorable decision.”\n\nEnvironmental laws that allow citizen suits include:\n\n\n"}

In medieval England, there was no police force and the state bureaucracy was insufficiently well developed to be able to ensure obedience to new laws. The practice of allowing the public to sue for penalties was successful and soon became widespread.\n\nAn action by a common informer was termed a \"popular\" or \"qui tam\" action. A legal action by an informer had to be brought within a year of the offence, unless a specific time was prescribed by the statute. The informer had to prove his case strictly and was given no assistance by the court being denied discovery.\n\nFollowing the Revolution of 1688 in England, the Popery Act 1698 introduced a reward of £100 for the apprehension of any Roman Catholic priest. The result was that Catholics were placed at the mercy of common informers who harassed them for the sake of gain, even when the government would have left them in peace.\n\nJonathan Swift described common informers as \"a detestable race of people\" while Edward Coke called them \"viperous vermin\".\n\nIn 1931, Millie Orpen, a solicitor's clerk, brought an action as a common informer against a cinema chain for opening on a succession of Sundays, contrary to the Sunday Observance Act 1780, s.1. Orpen claimed £25,000 against the cinema company and individual members of its board of directors. The claim was based on a forfeit of £200 per performance per defendant. The judge, Mr Justice Rowlatt, expressed some distaste for the proceedings. He found against the cinema chain, awarding Orpen £5,000, with costs, but found for the individual directors on the grounds there was no evidence they were guilty on any particular Sunday. Costs were awarded to the directors against Orpen. The judge granted a stay pending an appeal by the company. Later in the year, Orpen brought a claim against another chain, but was thwarted by a change in the law legalising Sunday opening for cinemas before her case could be decided.\n\nMany statutes, such as the Simony Act 1588 and the White Herring Fisheries Act 1771, provide for penalties for offenders in breach of the provisions. Before the Common Informers Act 1951, there were further statutory provisions for the levied penalties to be paid over to an informer. For example, section 15 of the Commissioners Clauses Act 1847, still in force, states:\n\nThe Common Informers Act 1951 removed the right to recover a penalty from 48 Acts, including:\nMost of these have themselves been repealed. The Crown was also prohibited from bringing actions as a common informer (s.1(5)). The former penalties were not all abolished but were commuted to £100, later revised to level 3 of the standard scale though the purpose of this provision was obscure as it was thought that not even the Crown could now bring such an action.\n\n\"Qui tam\" claims were codified in the United States under the False Claims Act, under which Lincoln sought to penalise manufacturers who sold his Army shoddy goods. It saw a revival in the U.S. from 1986 in actions by \"whistleblowers\". In May 2007 a consultative document from the Home Office Ministry of John Reid raised the question of whether members of the public who informed on companies or individuals defrauding the government should be entitled to a reward. It gained the attention of the House on 24 May 2007:\n\nThe Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Vernon Coaker): Seizing criminal assets delivers a wide range of benefits, from depriving criminals of capital to reducing the incentives for crime and the harm caused by crime, as well as promoting fairness and confidence in the criminal justice system. In 2006-07 the total amount recouped by all agencies\ninvolved in asset recovery in England, Wales and Northern Ireland was £125 million. This is a five-fold increase over five years. We want to build on this success. The Government are therefore publishing today an Asset Recovery Action Plan. The Action Plan has two purposes. Firstly it sets out robust proposals on how we are to reach our challenging target of recovering £250 million of the proceeds of crime by 2009-10. The Plan goes on to outline, for consultation, policy proposals for taking things further, including some radical ideas to move towards the Government's long term vision of detecting up to £1 billion of criminal assets.\n\nThe consultation period will end on 23 November 2007. A copy of the Action Plan is being placed in the Library of the House.\nSubmissions were obtained from the Fraud Advisory Panel, the Institute of Chartered Accountants, and the Local Authorities Coordinators of Regulatory Services, amongst others.\n\n"}
{"id": "3161409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3161409", "title": "Comparative responsibility", "text": "Comparative responsibility\n\nComparative responsibility (known as comparative fault in some jurisdictions) is a doctrine of tort law that compares the fault of each party in a lawsuit for a single injury. Comparative responsibility may apply to intentional torts as well as negligence and encompasses the doctrine of comparative negligence.\n\nComparative responsibility divides the fault among parties by percentages, and then accordingly divides the money awarded to the plaintiff. The plaintiff may only recover the percentage of the damages he is not at fault for. If a plaintiff is found to be 25% at fault, he can recover only 75% of his damages.\n\nThere are several circumstances that make comparative responsibility intricate: when the plaintiff shares in fault for the damages, when a defendant who has a share of the fault cannot be included in the suit, when one of the defendants can not pay, and when there are charges of both negligence and intentional torts in the same action.\n\nCurrently, only Alabama will not allow a plaintiff to recover if it is proven to be in any way at fault. This rule is called contributory negligence, a doctrine perceived to be overly \"harsh\", which \"has caused all but a few States to substitute the doctrine of comparative negligence\".\n\nMost states will follow one of three solutions to the problem:\n\nAnother situation is where a defendant apportioned some fault can not pay his portion of the damages. States will cover this situation differently. There are four options:\n\nThird, is the issue of when one defendant is not present, the same options as above are present. However there is the initial question of whether to allow the fault of an absent defendant to be considered. States, again, are split on these issues.\n\nLastly, there is the issue of negligence and intentional torts in a single lawsuit. Courts, in the majority, do not apply comparative responsibility to intentional torts. However, some courts apply comparative responsibility to intentional torts. The law and academia on this issue is very complex, but typically support holding intentional tortfeasors in a suit subject to joint and several liability. Further, any negligent tortfeasor who negligently failed to protect the plaintiff from the intentional tortfeaser will be jointly and severally liable for the portion of the intentional tortfeasor's fault. This view is supported by the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Apportionment of Liability Section 1.\n\nEven more complicated is the issue of whether comparative fault should be allowed in strict liability actions. Most jurisdictions, starting with California (which also pioneered strict liability for defective products), have held that the jury should be allowed to apportion fault between plaintiffs and defendants even in strict products liability actions. The Restatement (Third) of Torts (section 25) reflects the current majority view that comparative negligence applies to the strict liability of defendant.\n"}

Beto, 405 U.S. 319 (1972), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the court upheld a Free Exercise claim on the basis of the allegations that the state of Texas had discriminated against a Buddhist prisoner by \"denying him a reasonable opportunity to pursue his Buddhist faith comparable to that offered other prisoners adhering to conventional religious precepts.\" \n\nFred Arispe Cruz, a Mexican-American born in San Antonio, Texas in 1939, was often in trouble with the police in his teenage years, and became addicted to heroin. In 1960, at 21, Cruz was arrested and convicted of “robbery by assault”. He was sentenced to 50 years in a state prison in 1961. \n\nCruz denied taking part in the robberies. Wanting to appeal his conviction but unable to afford a lawyer, Cruz began to read all of the law books that he could find in the prison library. Despite only having an 8th grade education, Cruz filed his first pro se appeal to the robbery charge in 1962. Fed up with the harsh field labor, brutal corporal punishments and arbitrary disciplinary hearings experienced by prisoners Cruz uses his new-found knowledge to write a lawsuit against the prison system.\n\nBecause of his “legal activities” Cruz was classified as an agitator and transferred to the “Ellis Unit” (Also known as the “Alcatraz of Texas”) in 1963. At the Ellis Unit Cruz was pushed to drop his lawsuit by enduring many hours of solitary confinement. In 1967 Cruz wrote to Reverend Hogen Fujimoto, minister in the Shin Buddhist Churches of America (BCA) to request information on Buddhism. Cruz shared the information he received with other inmates which landed him back in solitary, which at the time meant a bread and water diet with a small meal served every third day. \n\nDespite the abusive conditions Cruz succeeded in filing his own lawsuit as well as those of other inmates. One of the suits Cruz assisted with is that of a Muslim at the facility who argued that his civil rights were being violated. Warden McAdams punished two inmates for the incident and kept Muslim prisoners at work in the fields six days a week instead of the five days assigned to other inmates. Within days a riot broke out in the Muslim cell block. \n\nThis 1968 riot was the first at Ellis Unit and helped build solidarity among prisoners and gain the attention of outsiders. One of these outsiders was Frances Jalet (later Frances Jalet-Cruz, as Cruz and Jalet were married after his prison release), an attorney whom Cruz had contacted in 1967 after reading about her in a newspaper. Jalet, along with attorney William Bennett Turner, would assist Cruz in his watershed case, \"Cruz v. Beto\".\n\nCruz, a Buddhist, complained that he was not allowed to use the prison chapel, that he was prohibited from writing to his religious advisor, and that he was placed in solitary confinement for sharing his religious material with other prisoners. Cruz filed the lawsuit using his own toilet paper ration. The Federal District Court initially denied relief without a hearing or findings, holding the complaint to be in an area that should be left \"to the sound discretion of prison administration.\" \n\nAn amended complaint argued that: \n\nand contrasted that with the fact that the prison: \n\nso: \n\nThe court found that: \n\nMr. Chief Justice Burger concurred in the result: \"I concur in the result reached even though the allegations of the complaint are on the borderline necessary to compel an evidentiary hearing. Some of the claims alleged are frivolous; others do not present justiciable issues. There cannot possibly be any constitutional or legal requirement that the government provide materials for every religion and sect practiced in this diverse country. At most, Buddhist materials cannot be denied to prisoners if someone offers to supply them\".\n\nMr. Justice Rehnquist offered dissenting view of the decision. That dissent is summarized below:Unlike the Court, I am not persuaded that petitioner's complaint states a claim under the First Amendment, or that if the opinion of the Court of Appeals is vacated the trial court must necessarily conduct a trial upon the complaint.Petitioner alleges that voluntary services are made available at prison facilities so that Protestants, Catholics, and Jews may attend church services of their choice. None of our prior holdings [405 U.S. 319, 324] indicates that such a program on the part of prison officials amounts to the establishment of a religion.Petitioner is a prisoner serving 15 years for robbery in a Texas penitentiary. He is understandably not as free to practice his religion as if he were outside the prison walls. But there is no intimation in his pleadings that he is being punished for his religious views, as was the case in \"Cooper v. Pate\", 378 U.S. 546 (1964)None of our holdings under the First Amendment requires that, in addition to being allowed freedom of religious belief, prisoners be allowed freely to evangelize their views among other prisoners.Presumably prison officials are not obligated to provide facilities for any particular denominational services within a prison, although once they undertake to provide them for some they must make only such reasonable distinctions as may survive analysis under the Equal Protection Clause. [405 U.S. 319, 325]A long line of decisions by this Court has recognized that the \"equal protection of the laws\" guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment is not to be applied in a precisely equivalent way in the multitudinous fact situations 405 U.S. 319, 326 that may confront the courts. On the one hand, we have held that racial classifications are \"invidious\" and \"suspect.\" I think it quite consistent with the intent of the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment, many of whom would doubtless be surprised to know that convicts came within its ambit, to treat prisoner claims at the other end of the spectrum from claims of racial discrimination. Absent a complaint alleging facts showing that the difference in treatment between petitioner and his fellow Buddhists and practitioners of denominations with more numerous adherents could not reasonably be justified under any rational hypothesis, I would leave the matter in the hands of the prison officials.It has been assumed that the dismissal by the trial court must be treated as proper only if the standard of \"Conley v. Gibson\", 355 U.S. 41 (1957), would permit the grant of a motion under Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12 (b). I would not require the district court to inflexibly apply this general principle to the complaint of every inmate, who is in many respects in a different litigating posture than persons who are unconfined. The inmate stands to [405 U.S. 319, 327] gain something and lose nothing from a complaint stating facts that he is ultimately unable to prove. Though he may be denied legal relief, he will nonetheless have obtained a short sabbatical in the nearest federal courthouse. To expand the availability of such courtroom appearances by requiring the district court to construe [405 U.S. 319, 328] every inmate's complaint under the liberal rule of \"Conley v. Gibson\" deprives those courts of the latitude necessary to process this ever-increasing species of complaint.In addition, the trial court had before it the dismissal of another of petitioner's cases filed shortly before the instant action, where the trial judge had been exposed to myriad previous actions, and found them to be \"voluminous, repetitious, duplicitous and in many instances deceitful.\" Whatever might be the posture of this constitutional claim if petitioner had never flooded the courts with repetitive and duplicitous claims, and if it had not recently been adjudicated in an identical proceeding, I believe it could be dismissed as frivolous in the case before us.\nA film chronicling the life of Fred Cruz was produced and directed by Susanne Mason. The film, \"Writ Writer\", was broadcast/presented by PBS TV Broadcast on Independent Lens on Thursday, June 8, 2008.\n\n"}
{"id": "12689594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12689594", "title": "Dark (broadcasting)", "text": "Dark (broadcasting)\n\nIn the broadcasting industry, a dark television or silent radio station is one that has gone off the air for an indefinite period of time. Usually unlike dead air (broadcasting only silence), a station that is dark or silent does not even transmit a carrier signal.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC), a radio or television station is considered to have gone dark or silent if it is to be off the air for 30 days or longer. Prior to the Telecommunications Act of 1996, a \"dark\" station was required to surrender its broadcast license to the FCC, leaving it vulnerable to another party applying for it while its current owner was making efforts to get it back on the air. Following the 1996 landmark legislation, a licensee is no longer required to surrender the license while dark. Instead, the licensee may apply for a \"Notification of Suspension of Operations/Request for Silent STA\" (FCC Form 0386), stating the reason why the station has gone silent.\n\nA service can go dark for any number of reasons, including financial resources being drained to continue effective operation of the service as being of benefit to its community of license; abandonment for a different channel or to go cable-only; complicated technical adjustments involving radio antenna repair, requiring the broadcast tower to be de-energized for the work to be done; structure fire or natural disaster that has rendered the facility inoperable; or technical adjustments that would make it prohibitively expensive to perform the work and carry on the normal operations of the station in question.\n\nThe service is not required to notify the FCC of silence if the period of silence is less than 10 days. If the period of silence is to last at least 10 days but less than 30 days, the licensee must notify the FCC in writing explaining why the service is silent and an expected return to the air. A service that expects to be silent for more than 30 days must apply to the FCC using Form 0386, which can be done electronically (preferred method) or by a paper application. On this application, the date the station has gone dark or its targeted date to go silent must be stated on the application, along with the reason for silence. The Silent STA (special temporary authority) is valid for a period of 180 days. If the station is required to remain off the air beyond the 180-day period, a \"Request to Extend STA\" must be subsequently filed, along with the reason. However, any broadcast station that is dark (or transmits using facilities different from their license except for operation under STA) for 12 months has their license automatically canceled as a matter of law pursuant to section 312g of the Communications Act as amended. Some stations have been known to re-appear for a week or 2 to keep the license alive (WCKL when owned by the Black United Fund was famous for this as they did it for years) then applying for yet another silent STA.\n\nWhile a licensed station is silent, it must continue to meet tower lighting and marking requirements as per Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) mandate. If a station (silent or otherwise) must shut down its lighting system for an extended period of time (such as it being disabled by a lightning strike), it is required to notify the FAA immediately. The station is required to provide the FAA with its assigned tower number, latitude and longitude coordinates, and an anticipated time that the tower light operations will resume. A licensee has 15 days to make the necessary repairs until the FCC is notified by the FAA. Once repairs are made, the FAA must be notified that all is well.\n\nThe Telecommunications Act of 1996 was created in part to increase the accountability of broadcasters, while providing requested deregulation in response to the hardships of many small-town broadcasters with small audiences and revenues. Under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, licensees of stations that were listed as \"silent\" by the FCC (at the time around 400) were warned to either power their facilities back up or their licenses would be canceled permanently. The FCC did allow reasonable provision for broadcasters who notified them that they were trying to get back on the air. Nevertheless, many licenses were canceled, primarily those with abandoned facilities.\n\n"}

{"id": "840157", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=840157", "title": "Earthship", "text": "Earthship\n\nAn Earthship is a type of passive solar house that is made of both natural and upcycled materials such as earth-packed tires, pioneered by architect Michael Reynolds.\n\nAn Earthship addresses six principles or human needs:\n\n\nEarthship structures are intended to be \"off-the-grid-ready\" homes, with minimal reliance on public utilities and fossil fuels. They are constructed to use available natural resources, especially energy from the sun and rain water.\n\n\nThe Earthship architecture concept began to take shape in the 1970s.\n\nThe architect Michael Reynolds wanted to create a home that would do three things: first, it would utilize sustainable architecture, and material indigenous to the local area or recycled materials wherever possible; second, the homes would rely on natural energy sources and be independent from the \"grid\"; thirdly, it would be feasible for a person with no specialized construction skills to build. Eventually, Reynolds's vision was transformed into the common U-shaped earth-filled tire homes seen today.\n\nThe buildings are often horseshoe-shaped due to the difficulty of creating sharp 90 degree angles with rammed tires. In Reynolds's prototype at Taos, the opening of the horseshoe faces 10–15 degrees east of south to maximize natural light and solar-gain during the winter months, with windows on sun-facing walls admitting light and heat.\n\nThe book, \"Earthship I\", describes how to find the best angle depending on the building's geospatial location. The thick and dense walls provide thermal mass that naturally regulates the interior temperature during both cold and hot outside temperatures. The outer walls in the majority of Earthships are made of earth-rammed tires, but any dense material with a potential to store heat, such as concrete, adobe, earth bags, or stone, could in principle be used to create a building similar to an Earthship. The tire walls are staggered like traditional brick work, and often have \"concrete half blocks\" every other course, to equal the length of the staggered tire below. In an effort to cut down the use of concrete even further, they also use \"squishies\" - tires rammed in between a tight space to even out the course or to compensate for varying tire size.\n\nThe earth-rammed tires of an Earthship are assembled by teams of two people. One person shovels dirt and places it into the tire one scoop at a time. The other person, who stands on the tire, uses a sledgehammer to pack the dirt in while moving in a circle around the tire to keep the dirt even and to avoid warping the tire.\n\nRammed earth tires can weigh up to 300 pounds, so they are typically filled in place. Because the tire is full of soil, it does not burn when exposed to fire. In colder climates, extra insulation is added on the outside of the tire walls.\n\nOn top of the tire walls are either \"can and concrete bond beams\" made of recycled cans joined by concrete, or wooden bond beams with wooden shoes. These are attached to the tire walls using concrete anchors, poured blocks of concrete inside the top tires. Wooden shimming blocks placed on top of the wooden bond beam make up the wooden shoes. The wooden bond beam consists of two layers of lumber bolted on to the concrete anchors. Re-bar is used to \"nail\" the wooden shoes to the wooden bond beam.\n\nInternal, non-load-bearing walls are often made of a honeycomb of recycled cans joined by concrete; these are nicknamed tin can walls. These walls are usually thickly plastered with adobe, and resemble traditional adobe walls when finished.\n\nThe roof is made using trusses, or wooden support beams called vigas, that rest on the wooden shoes or the tin can walls placed on the bond beams. The roof as well as the north, east and west facing walls are heavily insulated to reduce heat loss.\n\nEarthships are designed to catch all the water they need from the local environment. Water used in an Earthship is harvested from rain, snow, and condensation. As water collects on the roof, it is channeled through a silt-catching device and into a cistern. The cisterns are positioned to gravity-feed a water organization module (WOM) that filters out bacteria and contaminants, making it suitable for drinking. The WOM consists of filters and a DC-pump. Water is then pushed into a conventional pressure tank to create common household water pressure.\n\nWater collected in this fashion is used for every household activity except flushing toilets. The toilets are flushed with greywater which has been used at least once already. Typically it is filtered waste-water from sinks and showers.\n\nGreywater, recycled water unsuitable for drinking, is used within the Earthship primarily for flushing toilets. Before the greywater can be reused, it is channeled through a grease and particle filter/digester and into a 30–60\" deep rubber-lined botanical cell, a miniature living machine, within the Earthship. Here the water is oxygenated and filtered using bacteria and plants to reduce the nutrient load. \nWater from the low end of the botanical cell is directed through a peat moss filter and collected in a reservoir or well. The reclaimed water is passed once more through a greywater board and used to flush conventional toilets.\n\nBlack water is water that has been used in a toilet. Earthships utilize anaerobic digestion in their septic tanks, which naturally separate solid waste. The black water is used in concrete cells containing plants, separate from the grey water plants in the greenhouse; it may also be used in exterior planters. Studies on the safety of growing food plants in a black water system show low levels of \"E. coli\" bacteria. It is not recommended to plant edibles in black water; building permits may be refused for plans indicating such usage of black water.\n\nWhere it is not possible to use flush-toilets operating on water, dry solar toilets are recommended.\n\nEarthships are designed to collect and store their own energy. The majority of electrical energy is harvested from the sun and wind. Photovoltaic panels and windturbines on or near the Earthship generate DC electricity that is stored in deep-cycle batteries. The batteries are housed in a purpose-built room on the roof. Additional energy can be obtained from gasoline-powered generators or by integrating with the city grid.\n\nIn an Earthship, a Power Organizing Module (POM) takes a proportion of stored energy from batteries and invert it for AC use. The Power Organizing Module is a prefabricated system provided by Earthship Biotecture that is simply attached to a wall on the interior of the Earthship and wired in a conventional manner. It includes the necessary equipment such as circuit breakers and converters. The energy run through the Power Organizing Module can be used to run any household appliance including washing machines, computers, kitchen appliances, print machines, and vacuums. Ideally, none of the electrical energy in an Earthship is used for heating or cooling.\n\nEarthships rely on a balance between the solar heat gain and the ability of the tire walls and subsoil to transport and store heat. They are designed to use the properties of thermal mass and with the intent that the exterior earth-rammed tire walls provide thermal mass that will soak up heat during the day and radiate heat during the night, keeping the interior climate relatively comfortable all day. In addition to the exterior tire walls, some Earthships are sunk into the earth to take advantage of earth-sheltering to reduce temperature fluctuations.\n\nSome earthship structures have suffered from heat loss into the ground during the heating season. This may be due to climatic differences between New Mexico where earthships were first built and cloudier, cooler, and wetter climates. Thermal performance problems may also have occurred due to thermal mass being erroneously equated to R-value. The imperial R-value of soil is about 1 per foot. Malcolm Wells, an architect and authority on earth-sheltered design, recommends an imperial R-value 10 insulation between deep soils and heated spaces. Wells's insulation recommendations increase as the depth of the soil decreases (a negative correlation).\n\nIn addition to thermal mass, Earthships use passive solar heating and cooling. Large front windows with integrated shades, trombe walls and other technologies such as skylights or Steve Baer's \"Track Rack\" solar trackers are used for heat regulation. Earthships are positioned so that its principal wall, which is nonstructural and made mostly of glass sheets, faces directly towards the equator. This positioning allows for optimum solar exposure. To allow the sun to heat the mass of the Earthship, the solar-oriented wall is angled so that it is perpendicular to light from the winter sun. This allows for maximum exposure in the winter, when heat is wanted, and lesser exposure in the summer, when heat is to be avoided. Some Earthships, especially those built in colder climates, use insulated shading on the solar-orientated wall to reduce heat loss during the night.\n\nCurrent Earthship designs like the global module have a \"double greenhouse\" where the outside glass is angled towards the equator, and an internal glass wall forms a walk way or hallway as you step into the Earthship. This greenhouse is primarily used to grow food; it also creates a barrier for the 'comfort zone' inside the house.\n\nEarthships structures have a natural ventilation system based on convection. A 30 ft pipe extends from the interior of the house under the berm, cooling the air by the time it gets to the comfort zone. As the hot air rises, the system creates a steady airflow - of cooler air coming in, and warmer air blowing out though a smaller vented window in the greenhouse.\n\nThe first earthship in South Africa was built by Angel and Yvonne Kamp between 1996 and 1998. They rammed a total of 1,500 tires for the walls. The Earthship, near Hermanus, is located in a 60 hectare private nature reserve which is part of a 500 hectare area enclosed in a game fence and borders the Walker Bay Nature Reserve.\n\nThe second earthship in South Africa is a recycling centre in Khayelitsha run as a swop shop concept. The centre was finished in December 2010. Another low cost house built with tires is in development in Bloemfontein.\n\nA project nearing completion in South Africa is a combined living quarters and the Sonskip / Aardskip open air museum in Orania. This earthship is based on the global earthship model and is built with a foundation of tires, has roof bearing walls built with earthbags, and interior walls built with cob, cans and plastic bottles. This earthship adheres to all six principles of an earthship. This is the largest earthbag earthship in the world.\n\nA residential house was in the planning phase for Swaziland in 2013.\n\nIn 2011, construction began on the Goderich Waldorf School of Sierra Leone. The school was the first educational institution to use earthship architecture. Although Mike Reynolds and a team of interns helped complete the first two classrooms, the majority of the building was built by community members who had been trained in Reynolds' building techniques.\n\nA new project was scheduled to commence in Malawi in October 2013.\n\nEarthship Ironbank was built by Martin and Zoe Freney south-east of Adelaide in South Australia and is the first earthship constructed with council permission in Australia. \n\nIn 2000, Michael Reynolds and his team came to build the first residential earthship in Boingt (Belgium). While water, power module, solar panels and the team were on their way to Europe, the mayor of Boingt put his veto on the building permit. Josephine Overeem, the woman who wanted to build the earthship, and Michael Reynolds decided to do a demonstration model in her back yard at her residence in Strombeek (Belgium). CLEVEL invited Reynolds from Belgium to Brighton in the UK, and orchestrated plans for the earthship in Brighton, started in 2003. This was the beginning of a series of trips made by Reynolds and the construction of earthships in the UK, France and the Netherlands.\n\nIn 2004, the very first Earthship in the UK was opened at Kinghorn Loch in Fife, Scotland. It was built by volunteers of the SCI charity. In 2005, the first earthship in England was established in Stanmer Park, Brighton with the Low Carbon Trust. In 2007, CLEVEL and Earthship Biotecture obtained planning permission to build on a development site overlooking the Brighton Marina in the UK. The application followed a six-month feasibility study, orchestrated by Daren Howarth, Kevan Trott and Michael Reynolds and funded by the UK Environment Agency and the Energy Savings Trust. The successful application was for sixteen one, two, and three-bedroom earthship homes on this site, expected to have a sale price of 250 - 400,000 pounds. The homes are all designed according to basic earthship principles developed in the United States and adapted to the UK. 15,000 tires will be recycled to construct these homes (the UK burns approximately 40 million tires each year). The plans include the enhancement of habitats on the site for lizards that already live there, which is the reasoning behind entitling the project \"The Lizard\". This would have been the first development of its kind in Europe.\n\nThe first official Earthship home in mainland Europe with official planning permission approval was built in a small French village called Ger. The home, which was owned by Kevan and Gillian Trott, was built in April 2007 by Kevan, Mike Reynolds and an Earthship Crew from Taos, it was sold to a family in 2014. The design was modified for a European climate and is seen as the first of many for the European arena. It is currently used as a holiday home for eco-tourists.\n\nFurther adaptation to the European context was undertaken by Daren Howarth and Adrianne Nortje in Brittany, France. They obtained full planning permission in 2007 and finished the Brittany Groundhouse as their own home during 2009. The build experience and learning is documented in the UK Grand Designs series and in their book.\n\nEarthships have been built or are being built in Portugal, Spain, France, Belgium, The Netherlands, United Kingdom, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Estonia and Czech Republic.\n\nThe first official earthship district (23 earthships) in Europe was developed in Olst (the Netherlands). Building started in Spring 2012 and completed in December, 2014. In Belgium, 1 earthship hybrid is also being built, intended as demonstration buildings. Since it is illegal to use tires in Belgium (for risk of leaking toxic metals like lead and zinc), the project uses earthbags instead.\n\nThe Earthships built in Europe by Michael Reynolds have to be adapted to perform as intended. Some showed problems with moisture and mould. Some research into thermal performance was done by the University of Brighton on the Brighton Earthship. The first successful construction of an Earthship in Germany (Tempelhof/Kreßberg, 2015/16) used fewer thermal bridges but increased insulation in cooperation with the Fraunhofer Institute to prevent any mould problems.\n\nAn earthship was constructed in 2015 by the Aitkinson family in southern Belize. It featured on the June 2015 UK Channel 4 TV programme Kevin McCloud's Escape to the Wild, season 1, episode 3.\n\nGuatemala also hosts two earthships.\n\nThe first Earthship in South America was built in January 2015 in the town of Ushuaia, Patagonia (Argentina). Today this building functions as a visitor center and example of self-sustainable living.\n\nIn March 2016, an Earthship school was built in Jaureguiberry, Uruguay.\n\nThe film \"Garbage Warrior\" is about Earthships and Reynolds' struggle with obtaining permits to build out of unconventional material and off the grid.\n\n\n\n"}

Attorney-General is the name of two cases of the Singapore courts, a High Court decision delivered in 2008 and the 2009 judgment by the Court of Appeal. The main issue raised by the case was whether the Collector of Land Revenue had treated the plaintiffs (later appellants), who were devotees of the Jin Long Si Temple, unequally by compulsorily acquiring for public purposes the land on which the temple stood but not the lands of a Hindu mission and a Christian church nearby. It was alleged that the authorities had acted in violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, which guarantees the rights to equality before the law and equal protection of the law.\n\nThe High Court held that the plaintiffs lacked \"locus standi\" to bring the action as they were not the temple's legal owners. In any case, as there was evidence that the authorities had rational reasons for treating the temple property differently from the property of the Mission and the Church, the High Court found that there had been no breach of Article 12(1). Furthermore, the Court determined that the plaintiffs were guilty of inordinate delay in bringing the action.\n\nOn appeal, this decision was upheld in part by the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal found that the plaintiffs (appellants) had \"locus standi\" to bring the action as they were members of a Buddhist association, for whose benefit the temple property was held by its trustees. In addition, the Court found that the plaintiffs had not been guilty of inordinate delay in commencing the suit. However, the Court agreed with the trial judge that the Collector had not acted in violation of Article 12(1). In determining this issue, the Court held that the test to be applied is \"whether there is a reasonable nexus between the state action taken and the object of the law\". Such a nexus will be absent if the action amounts to \"intentional and arbitrary discrimination\" or intentional systematic discrimination. It is insufficient if any inequality is due to \"inadvertence or inefficiency\", unless this occurs on a very substantial scale. In addition, inequalities arising from a reasonable administrative policy or which are mere errors of judgment are insufficient to constitute a violation of Article 12(1).\n\nThe plaintiffs in this case were devotees of the Jin Long Si Temple, which was a temple in the Serangoon area of Singapore espousing Buddhist, Confucian and Taoist teachings. The temple property, which was located near the site of the Bartley Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) Station, was compulsorily acquired pursuant to the Land Acquisition Act. The \"Government Gazette\" notification relating to the acquisition published on 20 January 2003 specified that the temple property (together with another piece of land nearby) had been acquired for the construction and comprehensive redevelopment of the Mass Rapid Transit's Circle Line.\n\nThe trustees of the temple property noted that the nearby Ramakrishna Mission (\"the Mission\") and the Bartley Christian Church (\"the Church\") were not similarly acquired, and proceeded to appeal against the acquisition through various avenues, including an appeal to the Prime Minister. Their attempts were unsuccessful.\n\nFollowing the failure of the last appeal by the trustees of the temple, in January 2008 the plaintiffs filed an application in the High Court for a declaratory order against the compulsory acquisition. Their filing was based on Article 12(1) of the Constitution of Singapore, which reads: \"All persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law.\" The filing alleged that the executive action of acquiring the temple land was discriminatory and in violation of Article 12(1).\n\nThe preliminary issue arising during the trial in the High Court was whether the plaintiffs had \"locus standi\" to commence the action. The plaintiffs claimed to have a strong emotional connection to the temple which gave them a \"legitimate interest\" in this issue. However, Justice Tan Lee Meng held that the plaintiffs, who were merely temple devotees, did not have the required \"locus standi\" to institute the proceedings, as opposed to the trustees of the temple who were its legal owners. He relied on the Court of Appeal's judgment in \"Karaha Bodas Co. LLC v. Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd.\" (2005), which stated that \"to have the necessary standing, the plaintiff must be asserting the recognition of a 'right' that is personal to him\". The Court also referred to Lord Diplock's judgment in \"Gouriet v. Union of Post Office Workers\" (1977) where he held that the courts should only be concerned with rights in so much as they are legal rights which are enforceable by one party against another.\n\nThe High Court rejected the plaintiffs' argument that, by compulsorily acquiring a temple, the Government was limiting a person's right under Article 15(1) of the Constitution to profess, practice and propagate his or her religion, and that this in turn gave him or her the legal right to commence an action on the ground that where an individual's constitutional rights are affected, he or she has a sufficient interest to ensure that his or her rights are protected. The court ruling held that this land acquisition matter was not in any way related to religious freedom. Because the acquisition was not related to religious freedom, the High Court found that only the trustees who were the legal owners of the temple property had the requisite \"locus standi\" to institute proceedings if they deemed their rights to have been infringed.\n\nIn his ruling, Justice Tan cited \"Ong Ah Chuan v. Public Prosecutor\" (1980) for the proposition that \"[e]quality before the law and equal protection of the law require that \"like should be compared with like\". What Article 12(1) of the Constitution assures to the individual is the right to equal treatment with other individuals in \"similar circumstances\".\" He noted that the plaintiffs had made it clear that they were not alleging bad faith on the part of the authorities in acquiring the temple land; rather, that they asserted there were no rational reasons for treating the temple property differently from that of the Mission and the Church.\n\nHowever, the judge regarded this as an \"unsubstantiated allegation\". According to a notification published in the \"Government Gazette\", the temple property had been acquired for comprehensive redevelopment of the site. Under section 5(3) of the Land Acquisition Act, the notification was conclusive evidence that the property was required for that purpose. The judge accepted evidence tendered by the Attorney-General that the property of the Church and the Mission had not been compulsorily acquired because they were unsuitable for redevelopment. As no state land adjoined the Church property or the surrounding lands, there was no reasonable opportunity for amalgamating the Church property with existing state land. As for the Mission property, the three main buildings on it had been under study for conservation since 2002, and were gazetted for conservation in 2006. There was \"ample evidence\" that, where necessary, the Government had acquired for public purposes properties zoned as places of worship.\n\nAlthough one of the plaintiffs' witnesses, a chartered land surveyor, had suggested that the authorities could redevelop the land in a different manner, he did not state that the authorities' redevelopment plan was wrong or indefensible. The court was not in a position to decide which plans for redeveloping areas in Singapore were better. Thus, the acquisition of the temple property had not infringed Article 12(1) of the Constitution.\n\nThe Court found that, in any case, the plaintiffs had inordinately delayed commencing an action. The Court noted that the notice to acquire the land had been gazetted on 20 January 2003, more than five years before the High Court decision. Tan rejected the plaintiffs' argument that they were not guilty of delay since it was only in November 2007 that they learned that the authorities would not be reversing their decision. In his view, the fact that the decision would not be reversed was \"made plain long ago\".\n\nOn appeal to the Court of Appeal, three issues were raised. The first issue was whether the plaintiffs (appellants) had the requisite \"locus standi\". The second was whether there had been an inordinate delay on the appellants' part in pursuing the matter in court. The third issue is the most significant, namely, whether the acquisition of the temple property violated Article 12(1) of the Constitution.\n\nThe Court of Appeal disagreed with the trial judge's finding with regard to \"locus standi\". Judge of Appeal Andrew Phang, delivering the Court's judgment, opined that since according to the land register the temple was held in trust for San Jiao Sheng Tang Buddhist Association, of which the devotees were members, they had the requisite \"locus standi\" to bring the issue before the court.\n\n\"Eng Foong Ho\" was subsequently cited in \"Tan Eng Hong v. Attorney-General\" (2011) in support of the proposition that in order for a person to have \"locus standi\" to launch a constitutional claim, he or she must allege a violation of his or her own constitutional rights – that is, a \"substantial interest\" – rather than satisfy a lower \"sufficient interest\" test.\n\nThe Court of Appeal also held that although there had \"prima facie\" been a delay, the appellants at the time had believed that the trustees and the authorities were engaged in settlement discussions that might lead to resolution of the dispute. In those circumstances, the Court opined that there had not been an inordinate delay by the appellants in starting their lawsuit. Furthermore, the Court opined on an \"obiter\" basis that, in any case, a \"delay in asserting one's constitutional rights may not always be a relevant factor unless the State has been irreparably prejudiced by the assertion of such rights\".\n\nIn its ruling, the Court of Appeal cited \"Ong Ah Chuan\", wherein Lord Diplock held that Article 12(1), which sets out the principle of equality before the law and equal protection of the law, \"prohibits laws which require that some individuals within a single class should be treated by way of punishment more harshly than others\". In essence, persons belonging to the same class should be treated in the same manner. Bearing in mind the separation of powers, Lord Diplock was of the opinion that it was up to the legislature to decide the differentia distinguishing different classes of individuals. If the factor which the legislature adopts as constituting the dissimilarity in circumstances is not purely arbitrary but bears a reasonable relation to the social object of the law, there is no inconsistency with Article 12(1) of the Constitution.\n\nThis concept was more fully expounded in \"Public Prosecutor v. Taw Cheng Kong\" (1998), in which the Court of Appeal reasoned that since the object of Article 12(1) is to guard against various forms of arbitrariness, the test to be applied is to ask if the law treats different classes of persons differently. If it does, then the court must ask whether the differential treatment is based on intelligible differentia. The court must then go on to consider whether the basis of differential treatment bears a reasonable relation or nexus to the object of the law.\n\nIn \"Eng Foong Ho\", the Court of Appeal noted that it was not necessary to discuss the principle of reasonable classification of laws which was the subject of \"Taw Cheng Kong\", since the appellants had not challenged the constitutionality of the Land Acquisition Act. In the present case, the appellants were challenging the application rather than the validity of the Act. The Court therefore applied a modified form of the \"Taw Cheng Kong\" rational nexus test, holding that \"[t]he question is whether there is a reasonable nexus between the state action and the objective to be achieved by the law\". The Court opinion relied on the principles set out in the Privy Council cases \"Howe Yoon Chong v. Chief Assessor\" (1980) and \"Howe Yoon Chong v. Chief Assessor\" (1990). These cases involved alleged inequality in property valuation for the purpose of determining property tax. The significance of the two \"Howe Yoon Chong\" cases is that they prescribed limits as to what constitutes inequality. Several salient points were drawn from the cases in \"Eng Foong Ho\":\n\n\nThio Li-ann has noted that it is not clear whether the Court of Appeal was laying down \"intentional and arbitrary discrimination\" as the sole test for whether executive acts comply with Article 12(1) of the Constitution, or whether it is only one possible test and that executive acts can also be challenged if they fail a reasonable classification test. This is because \"[a]rbitrariness implies the lack of any rationality\", and it is much harder for a plaintiff to prove that executive action is irrational than to show that there is no reasonable classification in the action.\n\nOn the facts, Justice Phang remarked in his opinion that the appellants had not alleged any arbitrary action by the Government in compulsorily acquiring the temple property, and had in fact conceded that the acquisition had been proceeded with in good faith. Thus, the judge noted that \"it is not clear where the discrimination lies other than in the consequential fact that the properties of the Mission and the Church were not acquired but that of the Temple was\". The Attorney-General (respondent) presented the following evidence:\n\n\nIn essence, the Court found that the decision of the Collector of Land Revenue was \"based solely on planning considerations\". This finding satisfied the rational nexus test, and thus it was clear that Article 12(1) of the Constitution had not been violated.\n\nJustice Phang also held that section 5(3) of the Land Acquisition Act was not necessarily determinative of the matter in the Collector's favour, as acquisitions can be challenged for having been made in bad faith. However, the provision applied in this case as no bad faith on the Collector's part had been alleged by the appellants.\n\n\n\n \n"}
{"id": "874346", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=874346", "title": "Forensic accounting", "text": "Forensic accounting\n\nForensic accounting, forensic accountancy or financial forensics is the specialty practice area of accounting that describes engagements that result from actual or anticipated disputes or litigation. \"Forensic\" means \"suitable for use in a court of law\", and it is to that standard and potential outcome that forensic accountants generally have to work. Forensic accountants, also referred to as forensic auditors or investigative auditors, often have to give expert evidence at the eventual trial. All of the larger accounting firms, as well as many medium-sized and boutique firms and various police and government agencies have specialist forensic accounting departments. Within these groups, there may be further sub-specializations: some forensic accountants may, for example, just specialize in insurance claims, personal injury claims, fraud, anti-money-laundering, construction, or royalty audits.\n\nForensic accounting is defined as \"the application of investigative and analytical skills for the purpose of resolving financial issues in a manner that meets standards required by courts of law. Forensic accountants apply special skills in accounting, auditing, finance, quantitative methods, certain areas of the law, research and investigative skills to collect, analyze and evaluate evidential matter and to interpret and communicate findings.\"\n\nFinancial forensic engagements may fall into several categories. For example:\nForensic accountants often assist in professional negligence claims where they are assessing and commenting on the work of other professionals. Forensic accountants are also engaged in marital and family law of analyzing lifestyle for spousal support purposes, determining income available for child support and equitable distribution.\n\nEngagements relating to criminal matters typically arise in the aftermath of fraud. They frequently involve the assessment of accounting systems and accounts presentation—in essence assessing if the numbers reflect reality.\n\nSome forensic accountants specialize in forensic analytics which is the procurement and analysis of electronic data to reconstruct, detect, or otherwise support a claim of financial fraud. The main steps in forensic analytics are (a) data collection, (b) data preparation, (c) data analysis, and (d) reporting. For example, forensic analytics may be used to review an employee's purchasing card activity to assess whether any of the purchases were diverted or divertible for personal use.\n\nForensic accountants, investigative accountants or expert accountants may be involved in recovering proceeds of serious crime and in relation to confiscation proceedings concerning actual or assumed proceeds of crime or money laundering. In the United Kingdom, relevant legislation is contained in the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. Forensic accountants typically hold the following qualifications; Certified Forensic Accounting Professional [Certified Forensic Auditors] (CFA - England & Wales) granted by the Forensic Auditors Certification Board of England and Wales (FACB), Certified Fraud Examiners (CFE - US / International), Certificate Course on Forensic Accounting and Fraud Detection (FAFD) by Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), Certified Public Accountants (CPA - US) with AICPA's [Certified in Financial Forensics est. 2008] (CFF) Credentials, Chartered Accountants (CA - Canada), Certified Management Accountants (CMA - Canada), Chartered Professional Accountants (CPA - Canada)), Chartered Certified Accountants (CCA - UK), or Certified Forensic Investigation Professionals (CFIP). In India there is a separate breed of forensic accountants called Certified Forensic Accounting Professionals.\n\nThe Certified Forensic Accountant (CRFAC) program from the American Board of Forensic Accounting assesses Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) knowledge and competence in professional forensic accounting services in a multitude of areas. Forensic accountants may be involved in both litigation support (providing assistance on a given case, primarily related to the calculation or estimation of economic damages and related issues) and investigative accounting (looking into illegal activities). The American Board of Forensic Accounting was established in 1993. \n\nIn 2016, the Forensic Auditors Certification Board (FACB) of England and Wales was established by the major forensic auditing and accounting bodies from across the world with its registered address in London. FACB is a professional bodies membership body comprising the International Institute of Certified Forensic Accountants (IICFA) of USA, Institute of Forensic Auditors of Zimbabwe (IFA), Institute of Forensic Accountants of Pakistan (IFAP), Institute of Certified Forensic Accountants (ICFA) of USA and Canada and the Institute of Forensic Accountants of Nigeria (IFA). FACB plays several roles and one the roles is standardization of the examination and certification of forensic auditors globally. Forensic auditors and accountants sit for one examination that is set by FACB and upon passing and meeting all the professional requirements, are awarded the credential, Certified Forensic Auditor (CFA) or the Registered Forensic Auditor (RFA) for practitioners who intend to go into public practice. All certification is renewed on an annual basis. Apart from practitioners certification, FACB is an oversight body which accredits prospective member organization before admission as part of quality checks. Persons with the FACB credential can practice as forensic auditors on a global scale.\n\nLarge accounting firms often have a forensic accounting department.\n\nForensic accounting and fraud investigation methodologies are different than internal auditing. Thus forensic accounting services and practice should be handled by forensic accounting experts, not by internal auditing experts. Forensic accountants may appear on the crime scene a little later than fraud auditors, but their major contribution is in translating complex financial transactions and numerical data into terms that ordinary laypersons can understand. That is necessary because if the fraud comes to trial, the jury will be made up of ordinary laypersons. On the other hand, internal auditors move on checklists that may not surface the evidence that the jury or regulatory bodies look for. The fieldwork may carry out legal risks if internal auditing checklists are employed instead asking to a forensic accountant and may result serious consultant malpractice risks.\n\nForensic accountants utilize an understanding of economic theories, business information, financial reporting systems, accounting and auditing standards and procedures, data management & electronic discovery, data analysis techniques for fraud detection, evidence gathering and investigative techniques, and litigation processes and procedures to perform their work. Forensic accountants are also increasingly playing more proactive risk reduction roles by designing and performing extended procedures as part of the statutory audit, acting as advisers to audit committees, fraud deterrence engagements, and assisting in investment analyst research.\n\nA December 10,2014 Business Insider article explains Benford's Law as follows: in most naturally occurring datasets, the first digit of a number is 1, about 30% of the time, 2 about 18% of the time and 9 only about 5% of the time. So, one can identify the probable area of fraud by looking at the occurrences of the first digit in a given dataset.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "32164513", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32164513", "title": "Habeas Corpus Suspension Act (1863)", "text": "Habeas Corpus Suspension Act (1863)\n\nThe Habeas Corpus Suspension Act, (1863), entitled \"An Act relating to Habeas Corpus, and regulating Judicial Proceedings in Certain Cases,\" was an Act of Congress that authorized the president of the United States to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in response to the American Civil War and provided for the release of political prisoners. It began in the House of Representatives as an indemnity bill, introduced on December 5, 1862, releasing the president and his subordinates from any liability for having suspended habeas corpus without congressional approval. The Senate amended the House's bill, and the compromise reported out of the conference committee altered it to qualify the indemnity and to suspend habeas corpus on Congress's own authority. Abraham Lincoln signed the bill into law on March 3, 1863, and suspended habeas corpus under the authority it granted him six months later. The suspension was partially lifted with the issuance of Proclamation 148 by Andrew Johnson, and the Act became inoperative with the end of the Civil War. The exceptions to his Proclamation 148 were the States of Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas, the District of Columbia, and the Territories of New Mexico and Arizona.\n\nAt the outbreak of the American Civil War in April 1861, Washington, D.C., was largely undefended, rioters in Baltimore, Maryland threatened to disrupt the reinforcement of the capital by rail, and Congress was not in session. The military situation made it dangerous to call Congress into session. Abraham Lincoln, the president of the United States, therefore authorized his military commanders to suspend the writ of habeas corpus between Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia (and later up through New York City). Numerous individuals were arrested, including John Merryman and a number of Baltimore police commissioners; the administration of justice in Baltimore was carried out through military officials. When Judge William Fell Giles of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland issued a writ of habeas corpus, the commander of Fort McHenry, Major W. W. Morris, wrote in reply, \"At the date of issuing your writ, and for two weeks previous, the city in which you live, and where your court has been held, was entirely under the control of revolutionary authorities.\"\n\nMerryman's lawyers appealed, and in early June 1861, U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger Taney, writing as the United States Circuit Court for Maryland, ruled in \"ex parte Merryman\" that Article I, section 9 of the United States Constitution reserves to Congress the power to suspend habeas corpus and thus that the president's suspension was invalid. The rest of the Supreme Court had nothing to do with \"Merryman\", and the other two Justices from the South, John Catron and James Moore Wayne acted as Unionists; for instance, Catron's charge to a Saint Louis grand jury, saying that armed resistance to the federal government was treason, was quoted in the \"New York Tribune\" of July 14, 1861. The President's advisers said the circuit court's ruling was invalid and it was ignored.\n\nWhen Congress was called into special session, July 4, 1861, President Lincoln issued a message to both houses defending his various actions, including the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, arguing that it was both necessary and constitutional for him to have suspended it without Congress. Early in the session, Senator Henry Wilson introduced a joint resolution \"to approve and confirm certain acts of the President of the United States, for suppressing insurrection and rebellion\", including the suspension of habeas corpus (S. No. 1). Senator Lyman Trumbull, the Republican chairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, had reservations about its imprecise wording, so the resolution, also opposed by anti-war Democrats, was never brought to a vote. On July 17, 1861, Trumbull introduced a bill to suppress insurrection and sedition which included a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus upon Congress's authority (S. 33). That bill was not brought to a vote before Congress ended its first session on August 6, 1861 due to obstruction by Democrats, and on July 11, 1862, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary recommended that it not be passed during the second session, either, but its proposed habeas corpus suspension section formed the basis of the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act.\n\nIn September 1861 the arrests continued, including a sitting member of Congress from Maryland, Henry May, along with one third of the Maryland General Assembly, and Lincoln expanded the zone within which the writ was suspended. When Lincoln's dismissal of Justice Taney's ruling was criticized in an editorial that month by a prominent Baltimore newspaper editor Frank Key Howard, Francis Scott Key's grandson and Justice Taney's grand-nephew by marriage, he was himself arrested by federal troops without trial. He was imprisoned in Fort McHenry, which, as he noted, was the same fort where the Star Spangled Banner had been waving \"o'er the land of the free\" in his grandfather's song.\n\nIn early 1862 Lincoln took a step back from the suspension of habeas corpus controversy. On February 14, he ordered all political prisoners released, with some exceptions (such as the aforementioned newspaper editor) and offered them amnesty for past treason or disloyalty, so long as they did not aid the Confederacy. In March 1862 Congressman Henry May, who had been released in December 1861, introduced a bill requiring the federal government to either indict by grand jury or release all other \"political prisoners\" still held without habeas corpus. May's bill passed the House in summer 1862, and it would later be included in the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act, which would require actual indictments for suspected traitors.\n\nSeven months later, faced with opposition to his calling up of the militia, Lincoln again suspended habeas corpus, this time through the entire country, and made anyone charged with interfering with the draft, discouraging enlistments, or aiding the Confederacy subject to martial law. In the interim, the controversy continued with several calls made for prosecution of those who acted under Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus; former Secretary of War Simon Cameron had even been arrested in connection with a suit for trespass \"vi et armis\", assault and battery, and false imprisonment. Senator Thomas Holliday Hicks, who had been governor of Maryland during the crisis, told the Senate, \"I believe that arrests and arrests alone saved the State of Maryland not only from greater degradation than she suffered, but from everlasting destruction.\" He also said, \"I approved them [the arrests] then, and I approve them now; and the only thing for which I condemn the Administration in regard to that matter is that they let some of these men out.\"\n\nWhen the Thirty-seventh Congress of the United States opened its third session in December 1862, Representative Thaddeus Stevens introduced a bill \"to indemnify the President and other persons for suspending the writ of habeas corpus, and acts done in pursuance thereof\" (H.R. 591). This bill passed the House over relatively weak opposition on December 8, 1862.\n\nWhen it came time for the Senate to consider Stevens' indemnity bill, however, the Committee on the Judiciary's amendment substituted an entirely new bill for it. The Senate version referred all suits and prosecutions regarding arrest and imprisonment to the regional federal circuit court with the stipulation that no one acting under the authority of the president could be faulted if \"there was reasonable or probable cause\", or if they acted \"in good faith\", until after the adjournment of the next session of Congress. Unlike Stevens' bill, it did not suggest that the president's suspension of habeas corpus upon his own authority had been legal.\n\nThe Senate passed its version of the bill on January 28, 1863, and the House took it up in mid-February before voting to send the bill to a conference committee on February 19. The House appointed Thaddeus Stevens, John Bingham, and George H. Pendleton to the conference committee. The Senate agreed to a conference the following day and appointed Lyman Trumbull, Jacob Collamer, and Waitman T. Willey. Stevens, Bingham, Trumbull, and Collamer were all Republicans; Willey was a Unionist; Pendleton was the only Democrat.\n\nOn February 27, the conference committee issued its report. The result was an entirely new bill authorizing the explicit suspension of habeas corpus.\n\nIn the House, several members left, depriving the chamber of a quorum. The Sergeant-at-Arms was dispatched to compel attendance and several representatives were fined for their absence. The following Monday, March 2, the day before the Thirty-Seventh Congress had previously voted to adjourn, the House voted to accept the new bill, with 99 members voting in the affirmative and 44 against.\nThe Senate spent the evening of March 2 into the early morning of the next day debating the conference committee amendments. There, several Democratic Senators attempted a filibuster. Cloture had not yet been adopted as a rule in the Senate, so there was no way to prevent a minuscule minority from holding up business by refusing to surrender the floor. First James Walter Wall of New Jersey spoke until midnight, when Willard Saulsbury, Sr., of Delaware gave Republicans an opportunity to surrender by moving to adjourn. That motion was defeated 5–31, after which Lazarus W. Powell of Kentucky began to speak, yielding for a motion to adjourn from William Alexander Richardson of Illinois forty minutes later, which was also defeated, 5–30. Powell continued to speak, entertaining some hostile questions from Edgar Cowan of Pennsylvania which provoked further discussion, but retaining control of the floor. At seven minutes past two in the morning, James A. Bayard, Jr., of Delaware motioned to adjourn, the motion again failing, 4–35, and Powell retained control of the floor. Powell yielded the floor to Bayard, who then began to speak. At some point later, Powell made a motion to adjourn, but Bayard apparently had not yielded to him for that motion. When this was pointed out, Powell told Bayard to sit down so he could make the motion, assuming that Bayard would retain control of the floor if the motion failed, as it did, 4–33. The presiding officer, Samuel C. Pomeroy of Kansas, immediately called the question of concurring in the report of the conference committee and declared that the ayes had it, and Trumbull immediately moved that the Senate move on to other business, which motion was agreed to. The Democrats objected that Bayard still had the floor, that he had merely yielded it for a motion to adjourn, but Pomeroy said he had no record of why Bayard had yielded the floor, meaning the floor was open once Powell's motion to adjourn had failed, meaning that the presiding officer was free to call the question. In this way, the bill cleared the Senate.\n\nThe next day, Senate Democrats protested the manner in which the bill had passed. During the ensuring discussion, the president pro tempore asked permission \"to sign a large number of enrolled bills\", among which was the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act. The House had already been informed that the Senate had passed the bill, and the engrossed bills were sent to the president, who immediately signed the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act into law.\n\nThe Act allowed the president to suspend the writ of habeas corpus so long as the Civil War was ongoing. Normally, a judge would issue a writ of habeas corpus to compel a jailer to state the reason for holding a particular prisoner and, if the judge was not satisfied that the prisoner was being held lawfully, could release him. As a result of the Act, the jailer could now reply that a prisoner was held under the authority of the president and this response would suspend further proceedings in the case until the president lifted the suspension of habeas corpus or the Civil War ended.\n\nThe Act also provided for the release of prisoners in a section originally authored by Maryland Congressman Henry May, who had been arrested without recourse to habeas in 1861, while serving in Congress. It required the secretaries of State and War to provide the judges of the federal district and circuit courts with a list of every person who was held as a state or political prisoner and not as a prisoner of war wherever the federal courts were still operational. If the secretaries did not include a prisoner on the list, the judge was ordered to free them. If a grand jury failed to indict anyone on the list before the end of its session, that prisoner was to be released, so long as they took an oath of allegiance and swore that they would not aid the rebellion. Judges could, if they concluded that the public safety required it, set bail before releasing such unindicted prisoners. If the grand jury did indict a prisoner, that person could still be set free on bail if they were charged with a crime that in peacetime would ordinarily make them eligible for bail. These provisions for those held as \"political prisoners\", as Henry May felt he had been, were first proposed by Congressman May in a bill in March 1862.\n\nThe Act further restricted how and why military and civilian officials could be sued. Anyone acting in an official capacity could not be convicted for false arrest, false imprisonment, trespassing, or any crime related to a search and seizure; this applied to actions done under Lincoln's prior suspensions of habeas corpus as well as future ones. If anyone brought a suit against a civilian or military official in any state court, or if state prosecutors went after them, the official could request that the trial instead take place in the (friendlier) federal court system. Moreover, if the official won the case, they could collect double in damages from the plaintiff. Any case could be appealed to the United States Supreme Court on a writ of error. Any suits to be brought against civilian or military officials had to be brought within two years of the arrest or the passage of the Act, whichever was later.\n\nPresident Lincoln used the authority granted him under the Act on September 15, 1863, to suspend habeas corpus throughout the Union in any case involving prisoners of war, spies, traitors, or any member of the military. He subsequently both suspended habeas corpus and imposed martial law in Kentucky on July 5, 1864. An objection was made to the Act that it did not itself suspend the writ of habeas corpus but instead conferred that authority upon the president, and that the Act therefore violated the nondelegation doctrine prohibiting Congress from transferring its legislative authority, but no court adopted that view. Andrew Johnson restored civilian courts to Kentucky in October, 1865, and revoked the suspension of habeas corpus in states and territories that had not joined the rebellion on December 1 later that year. At least one court had already ruled that the authority of the president to suspend the privilege of the writ had expired with the end of the rebellion a year and a half earlier.\nOne of those arrested while habeas corpus was suspended was Lambdin P. Milligan. Milligan was arrested in Indiana on October 5, 1864, for conspiring with four others to steal weapons and invade Union prisoner-of-war camps to release Confederate prisoners. They were tried before a military tribunal, found guilty, and sentenced to hang. In \"ex parte Milligan\", the United States Supreme Court held that the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act did not authorize military tribunals, that as a matter of constitutional law the suspension of habeas corpus did not itself authorize trial by military tribunals, and that neither the Act nor the laws of war permitted the imposition of martial law where civilian courts were open and operating unimpeded.\n\nThe Court had earlier avoided the questions arising in \"ex parte Milligan\" regarding the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act in a case concerning former Congressman and Ohio Copperhead politician Clement Vallandigham. General Ambrose E. Burnside had him arrested in May 1863 claiming his anti-Lincoln and anti-war speeches continued to give aid to the enemy after his having been warned to cease doing so. Vallandigham was tried by a military tribunal and sentenced to two years in a military prison. Lincoln quickly commuted his sentence to banishment to the Confederacy. Vallandigham appealed his sentence, arguing that the Enrollment Act did not authorize his trial by a military tribunal rather than in ordinary civilian courts, that he was not ordinarily subject to court martial, and that General Burnside could not expand the jurisdiction of military courts on his own authority. The Supreme Court did not address the substance of Vallandigham's appeal, instead denying that it possessed the jurisdiction to review the proceedings of military tribunals upon a writ of habeas corpus without explicit congressional authorization. Vallandigham was subsequently deported to the South where he turned himself in for arrest as a Union citizen behind enemy lines and was placed in a Confederate prison.\n\nMary Elizabeth Jenkins Surratt (May 1823 – July 7, 1865) was an American boarding house owner who was convicted of taking part in the conspiracy to assassinate President Abraham Lincoln. She was sentenced to death but her lawyers Clampitt and Aiken had not finished trying to save their client. On the morning of July 7, they asked a District of Columbia court for a writ of habeas corpus, arguing that the military tribunal had no jurisdiction over their client. The court issued the writ at 3 A.M., and it was served on General Winfield Scott Hancock. Hancock was ordered to produce Surratt by 10 A.M. General Hancock sent an aide to General John F. Hartranft, who commanded the Old Capitol Prison, ordering him not to admit any United States marshal (as this would prevent the marshal from serving a similar writ on Hartranft). President Johnson was informed that the court had issued the writ, and promptly cancelled it at 11:30 A.M. under the authority granted to him by the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act of 1863. General Hancock and United States Attorney General James Speed personally appeared in court and informed the judge of the cancellation of the writ. Mary Surratt was hanged, becoming the first woman executed by the United States federal government.\n\nBecause all of the provisions of the Act referred to the Civil War, they were rendered inoperative with the conclusion of the war and no longer remain in effect. The Habeas Corpus Act of 1867 partially restored habeas corpus, extending federal habeas corpus protection to anyone \"restrained of his or her liberty in violation of the constitution, or of any treaty or law of the United States\", while continuing to deny habeas relief to anyone who had already been arrested for a military offense or for aiding the Confederacy. The provisions for the release of prisoners were incorporated into the Civil Rights Act of 1871, which authorized the suspension of habeas corpus in order to break the Ku Klux Klan. Congress strengthened the protections for officials sued for actions arising from the suspension of habeas corpus in 1866 and 1867. Its provisions were omitted from the Revised Statutes of the United States, the codification of federal legislation in effect as of 1873.\n\n\n\n"}

Previously, only the common law provided protection to cargo-owners; but the Hague Rules should not be seen as a \"consumers' charter\" for shippers because the 1924 Convention actually favoured carriers and reduced their obligations to shippers.\n\nThe Hague Rules represented the first attempt by the international community to find a workable and uniform way to address the problem of shipowners regularly excluding themselves from all liability for loss or damage to cargo. The objective of the Hague Rules was to establish a minimum mandatory liability of carriers.\n\nUnder the Hague Rules the shipper bears the cost of lost/damaged goods if they cannot prove that the vessel was unseaworthy, improperly manned or unable to safely transport and preserve the cargo, i.e. the carrier can avoid liability for risks resulting from human errors provided they exercise due diligence and their vessel is properly manned and seaworthy. These provisions have frequently been the subject of discussion between shipowners and cargo interests on whether they provide an appropriate balance in liability.\n\nThe Hague Rules form the basis of national legislation in almost all of the world's major trading nations, and cover nearly all the present international shipping. The Hague Rules have been updated by two protocols, but neither addressed the basic liability provisions, which remain unchanged.\n\nThe Hague Rules were slightly amended (beginning in 1931, and further in 1977 and 1982) to become the Hague-Visby Rules. In addition, the U.N. established a fairer and more modern set of rules, the Hamburg Rules (effective 1992). Also a more radical and extensive set of rules is the Rotterdam Rules, but as of November 2015, only 3 states have ratified these rules, so they are not yet in force.\n"}

{"id": "1325197", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1325197", "title": "Hugh Despenser the Younger", "text": "Hugh Despenser the Younger\n\nHugh le Despenser, 1st Lord Despenser (c. 1286 – 24 November 1326), also referred to as \"the younger Despenser\", was the son and heir of Hugh le Despenser, Earl of Winchester (the elder Despenser) by his wife Isabella de Beauchamp, daughter of William de Beauchamp, 9th Earl of Warwick. He rose to national prominence as royal chamberlain and a favourite of Edward II of England. Despenser made many enemies across the nobility of England which, after the overthrow of Edward, eventually led to him being charged with high treason and ultimately hanged, drawn and quartered.\n\nHugh le Despenser the Younger rose to become Chamberlain and a close advisor to King Edward II, much as Despenser the Elder had been. Despenser the Younger claimed the Lordship of Glamorgan in 1317 through his wife Eleanor de Clare. He then accumulated more lands in the Welsh Marches and in England. At various points he was a knight of Hanley Castle in Worcestershire, Constable of Odiham Castle, and the Keeper of Bristol Castle, Porchester Castle and Dryslwyn Castle plus their respective towns, and the region of Cantref Mawr in Carmarthenshire.\n\nHe was also Keeper of the castles, manor, and lands of Brecknock, Hay, Cantref Selyf, \"etc.\", in County Brecon, and also Huntington, Herefordshire in England.\n\nHe was additionally given Wallingford Castle despite that this had previously been given to Queen Isabella of France for life.\n\nIn May 1306 Despenser was knighted at the Feast of the Swans alongside Prince Edward, and in that summer he married Eleanor de Clare, daughter of powerful noble Gilbert de Clare, and Joan of Acre. Eleanor's grandfather, Edward I, had owed the elder Despenser 2,000 marks, a debt which the marriage settled. When Eleanor's brother, Gilbert, was killed in 1314 at the Battle of Bannockburn, she unexpectedly became one of the three co-heiresses to the rich Gloucester earldom, and in her right, Hugh inherited Glamorgan and other properties. In just a few years Hugh went from a landless knight to one of the wealthiest magnates in the kingdom.\n\nEleanor was also the niece of the new king, Edward II of England, and this connection brought Despenser closer to the English royal court. He joined the baronial opposition to Piers Gaveston, the king's favourite (and Despenser's brother-in-law, through Gaveston's marriage to Eleanor's sister Margaret). Eager for power and wealth, Despenser seized Tonbridge Castle in 1315, after his brother-in-law's death under the misapprehension that it belonged to his mother-in-law; he relinquished it on discovering that the rightful owner was in fact the Archbishop of Canterbury. In 1318 he murdered Llywelyn Bren, a Welsh hostage in his custody.\n\nEleanor and Hugh had nine children who survived infancy:\n\nDespenser became royal chamberlain in 1318. As a royal courtier, Despenser manoeuvred into the affections of King Edward, displacing the previous favourite, Roger d'Amory. This came much to the dismay of the baronage as they saw him both taking their rightful places at court at best, and at worst being the new, worse Gaveston. By 1320 his greed was running free. He also supposedly vowed to be revenged on Roger Mortimer, because Mortimer's grandfather had killed his own. By 1321 he had earned many enemies in every stratum of society, from Queen Isabella in France, to the barons, to the common people. There was even a plot to kill Despenser by sticking his wax likeness with pins.\n\nFinally the barons took action upon King Edward and, at the beseeching of Queen Isabella, forced Despenser and his father into exile in August 1321. However, Edward's intent to summon them back to England was no secret. The king rallied support after an attack against Isabella's party at Leeds Castle, an event possibly deliberately orchestrated. Early in the following year, with Mortimer's barons busy putting down uprisings in their lands, the Despensers were able to return. Edward, now with the Despensers backing him once more, was able to crush the rebellion, securing first Mortimer's surrender, then that of Lancaster who was subsequently executed. \n\nKing Edward quickly reinstated Despenser as royal favourite. The time from the Despensers' return from exile until the end of Edward II's reign was a time of uncertainty in England. With the main baronial opposition leaderless and weak, having been defeated at the Battle of Boroughbridge, and Edward willing to let them do as they pleased, the Despensers were left unchecked. This maladministration caused hostile feeling for them and, by extension, Edward II. Ultimately, a year after his surrender and imprisonment, Mortimer escaped to France, where he began amassing a new rebellion.\n\nLike his father, the younger Despenser was accused of widespread criminality. Amongst other examples, Despenser seized the Welsh lands of his wife's inheritance while ignoring the claims of his two brothers-in-law. He further cheated his sister-in-law Elizabeth de Clare out of Gower and Usk, and forced Alice de Lacy, 4th Countess of Lincoln, to give up her lands to him. He had murdered Llywelyn Bren in 1318 while the Welshman was being held hostage, and during his exile he spent a period of time as a pirate in the English Channel, \"a sea monster, lying in wait for merchants as they crossed the sea\". In addition he imprisoned Sir William Cokerell in the Tower of London and extorted money from him.\n\n14th century court historian Froissart wrote that \"he was a sodomite\", and Adam Orleton, the Bishop of Winchester, also levelled the accusation at him (though Orleton's accusation came when he was defending himself from having claimed the same of King Edward). According to Froissart, Despenser's penis was severed and burned in his execution as a punishment for his sodomy and heresy. In 1326, as Isabella and Mortimer invaded, Orleton gave a sermon in which he publicly denounced Edward, who had fled with Despenser, as a sodomite. The annals of Newenham Abbey recording, ‘the king and his husband’ fled to Wales. \n\nQueen Isabella had a special dislike for Despenser. Alison Weir, in her 2005 book \"Queen Isabella: Treachery, Adultery, and Murder in Medieval England\", speculates that he had raped Isabella and that was the source of her hatred. While Isabella was in France to negotiate between her husband and the French king, she formed a liaison with Roger Mortimer and began planning an invasion of England, which ultimately came to fruition in October 1326. Their forces numbered only about 1,500 mercenaries to begin with, but the majority of the nobility rallied to them throughout October and November, preferring to stand with them rather than Edward and the hated Despensers.\n\nThe Despensers fled west with the King, with a sizeable sum from the treasury, however the escape was unsuccessful. Separated from the elder Despenser, the King and the younger Despenser were deserted by most of their followers, and were captured near Neath in mid-November. King Edward was placed in captivity and later forced to abdicate in favour of his son Edward III. The elder Despenser was hanged at Bristol on 27 October 1326, and the younger Despenser was brought to trial.\n\nDespenser tried to starve himself before his trial, but he was unsuccessful. He did face trial on 24 November 1326, in Hereford, before Mortimer and the Queen, and was found guilty on many charges. He was sentenced to death, with Isabella, Mortimer and their followers presiding over the protracted execution.\n\nDespenser was dragged naked through the streets, for the crowd's mistreatment. He was made a spectacle, which included writing on his body biblical verses against the capital sins he was accused of. Then he was hanged as a mere commoner, yet released before full asphyxiation could happen. \n\nIn Froissart's account of his execution, Despenser was then tied firmly to a ladder and his genitals sliced off and burned while he was still conscious. His entrails were slowly pulled out; finally, his heart was cut out and thrown into a fire. Froissart (or rather Jean le Bel's chronicle, on which he relied) is the only source to mention castration; other contemporary accounts have Despenser hanged, drawn and quartered, which usually did not involve castration. \n\nDespenser's body was beheaded, and cut into four pieces. His head was mounted on the gates of London.\n\nFour years later, in December 1330, his widow was given permission to gather and bury Depenser's remains at the family's Gloucestershire estate, but only the head, a thigh bone and a few vertebrae were returned to her.\n\nWhat may be the body of Despenser was identified in February 2008 in the village of Abbey Hulton in Staffordshire, the former site of Hulton Abbey. The skeleton, which was first uncovered during archaeological work in the 1970s, appeared to be that of a victim of a drawing and quartering as it had been beheaded and chopped into several pieces with a sharp blade, suggesting a ritual killing. Furthermore, it lacked several body parts, including the ones given to Despenser's wife. Radiocarbon analysis dated the body to between 1050 and 1385, and later tests suggested it to be that of a man over 34 years old. Despenser was 40 at the time of his death. In addition, the Abbey is located on lands that belonged to Hugh Audley, Despenser's brother-in-law, at the time.\n\nNo book-length biographical study of Hugh le Despenser exists, although \"The Tyranny and Fall of Edward II: 1321–1326\" by historian Natalie Fryde is a study of Edward's reign during the years that the Despensers' power was at its peak. Fryde pays particular attention to the subject of the Despensers' ill-gotten landholdings. The numerous accusations against the younger Despenser at the time of his execution have never been the subject of close critical scrutiny, although Roy Martin Haines called them \"ingenuous\" and noted their propagandistic nature.\n\nDespite the crucial and disastrous role he played in the reign of Edward II, Despenser is almost a minor character in Christopher Marlowe's play \"Edward II\" (1592), where, as \"Spencer\", he is little more than a substitute for the dead Gaveston. In 2006, he was selected by \"BBC History Magazine\" as the 14th century's worst Briton.\n\nHis image on the stained glass window of the Banqueting Hall of Cardiff Castle, shows his coat of arms inverted—a symbol of disgrace.\n\nEdward II of England and Hugh Despenser the elder extorted the lands of Alice de Lacy, 4th Countess of Lincoln, and to make the transfers of title appear legitimate, declared Hugh the younger her \"kinsman\".\n\n"}

Its website, \"Chilling Effects Clearinghouse\", allows recipients of cease-and-desist notices to submit them to the site and receive information about their legal rights and responsibilities.\n\nThe archive was founded in 2001 by Internet activists who were concerned that the unregulated private practice of sending cease-and-desist letters seemed to be increasing and was having an unstudied, but potentially significant, \"chilling effect\" on free speech.\n\nThe archive got a boost when Google began submitting its notices to the site in 2002. Google began to do so in response to the publicity generated when the Church of Scientology convinced Google to remove references and links to an anti-Scientology web site, Operation Clambake, in April 2002. The incident inspired vocal Internet users and groups to complain to Google, and links to the Clambake site were restored. Google subsequently began to contribute its notices to Chilling Effects, archiving the Scientology complaints and linking to the archive.\n\nStarting in 2002, researchers used the clearinghouse to study the use of cease-and-desist letters, primarily looking at Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) 512 takedown notices, non-DMCA copyright issues, and trademark claims.\n\nOn November 2, 2015, Chilling Effects announced its renaming to Lumen, as well as a number of international partnerships.\n\nCopyright holders complained that by republishing the URLs of infringing content after those URLs were removed from search engines, the database subverted the intent of the DMCA and was \"the largest repository of URLs hosting infringing content on the internet.\" The Copyright Alliance representative has described the project as \"repugnant\".

{"id": "1570279", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1570279", "title": "National Defence Radio Establishment", "text": "National Defence Radio Establishment\n\nThe National Defence Radio Establishment (, \"FRA\") is a Swedish\ngovernment agency organised under the Ministry of Defence. The two main tasks of FRA are signals intelligence (SIGINT), and support to government authorities and state-owned companies regarding computer security.\n\nThe FRA is not allowed to initialize any surveillance on their own, and operates purely on assignment from the Government, the Government Offices, the Armed Forces, the Swedish National Police Board and Swedish Security Service (SÄPO). Decisions and oversight regarding information interception is provided by the Defence Intelligence Court and the Defence Intelligence Commission; additional oversight regarding protection of privacy is provided by the Swedish Data Protection Authority.\n\nSignals Intelligence has existed in Sweden since 1905 when Swedish General Staff and Naval Staff respectively, had departments for signals intelligence and cryptanalysis. These departments succeeded, for instance, to decode the Russian Baltic Sea Fleet cipher. After World War I, this ability mostly ceased as politicians did not see its value and did not grant funding. The Swedish Navy still continued in a smaller scale and developed the competence further. One of the first major successes was in 1933 when the cipher of the Russian OGPU (predecessor to KGB) was solved.\n\nIn 1937, the Swedish Defence Staff was established and the Crypto Department, with its Crypto Detail IV, was responsible for cryptanalysis. In 1940, when Germany occupied Denmark and Norway, the German \"Wehrmacht\" requested to use the Swedish telephone network for its communication. This was accepted and Crypto Detail IV immediately started to intercept. The traffic was almost always encrypted by the German state-of-the-art cipher machine Geheimfernschreiber. This device was believed to produce indecipherable messages, with its 893,622,318,929,520,960 different crypto key settings. After two weeks of single hand work, the Swedish professor of mathematics Arne Beurling, decoded the cipher of the G-schreiber with only use of pencil and paper. This achievement was described by David Kahn, in his book \"The Codebreakers\": \"Quite possibly the finest feat of cryptanalysis performed during the Second World War was Arne Beurling's solution of the secret of the G-schreiber.\" During World War II, some 296,000 German messages were intercepted and in 1942 the Swedish Government took the decision to establish Försvarets Radioanstalt.\n\nThe first stationary collection site was located in the middle of Stockholm, but in 1940 it was moved to a number of villas in the suburban island of Lidingö. More sites were established in Sweden and in 1943, FRA moved its headquarters to Lovön, some 15 km from Stockholm. In the 1960s, even the location of the FRA headquarters was still highly secret.\n\nIn the final stage of the Continuation War, 1943–44, when the Soviet Union threatened to occupy Finland, Finnish intelligence requested to transfer about 200 specialists and advanced intelligence equipment to Sweden to establish an exile organisation. A transfer of a small contingent personnel and materials, Operation Stella Polaris, was carried out over a couple of nights in September 1944. Stella Polaris gave Sweden access to a wealth of qualified materials and signals intelligence officers, some of which were also employed. For Finland, it resulted in a domestic political affair and due to the Communist Party's strong influence in the government, several of the so-called \"Soviet Hostiles\" involved received prison sentences.\n\nOn 13 June 1952, the Swedish Air Force aircraft Tp 79 \"Hugin\" (DC-3) disappeared during a signal intelligence reconnaissance mission east of the Swedish island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea. The Swedish government initially claimed that the flight was only a navigational exercise, but later admitted that the aeroplane had U.S. electronic surveillance equipment and five specialists from FRA on board. Three days later, a Swedish Air Force search-and-rescue plane of the type Tp 47 (Catalina) was shot down by a Soviet MiG-15 fighter, but the crew was rescued by a nearby West German freighter ship. The Soviet Union denied any involvement in the disappearance of the DC-3, despite the fact that a raft from the aeroplane was found during the search with shrapnel from MiG-15 ammunition. In 1956, the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev admitted to Swedish Prime Minister Tage Erlander that the Soviet Union was indeed responsible for shooting down the plane, but this was not made public, not even to the relatives of the crewmen. Russia officially acknowledged the shooting down in 1991. In 2003, the wreck of the shot-down DC-3 was found about 55 km east of Gotland. Several of the crewmen's remains were found in the fuselage and the damage to the plane showed that it really had been shot at by a Soviet MiG-15 fighter.\n\nFRA's operational activity are organized into four departments: The Signals Intelligence Service (), The Department for Internet Operations (), The Department for Internal Support Services () and The Department for Technical Development and Other Technical Assistance (). In addition to this there is also a command staff and a number of specialist functions reporting directly to the Director-General.\n\nThe main headquarters is located on the island of Lovön in Stockholm County. The government allocated a total of SEK 860 million for the FRA in the annual budget for the fiscal year of 2014; an increase in spending with 38 million compared to the previous year, due to \"greater technical costs and changes abroad\". In 2009, the number of employees was \"just below 700\", according to the FRA.\n\nInterception of signals is done from fixed sites on Swedish territory, from the SIGINT ship , operated by the Swedish Navy and soon to be replaced by another vessel, and from two Gulfstream IV aircraft operated by the Swedish Air Force.\n\nTOP500 credited FRA with owning the world's fifth fastest supercomputer in their November 2007 list. According to the director-general's chief of staff, the computer is being used for \"cryptography and information security.\" By November 2013, the supercomputer had fallen off the list.\n\nThe FRA has a long history of intercepting radio signals, as the main intelligence agency producing and managing SIGINT in Sweden since 1942. However, up until 2009 the FRA was limited to wireless communications intelligence (COMINT), including wireless phone and Internet signals, something that was also left largely unregulated. As an ever-increasing amount of communications have transferred from radio to cables, the question of enabling FRA to collect information from cable communication was addressed by Göran Persson's cabinet in a government appointed committee of inquiry led by General Owe Wiktorin in 2003, resulting in a report suggesting a change in legislation (SOU 2003:30). In July 2005, the Minister for Defence Leni Björklund published a memorandum (Ds 2005:30) with proposed legislation changes, later passed on to the Cabinet of Fredrik Reinfeldt and Minister for Defence, Mikael Odenberg.\n\nPrior to the change in legislation, the main law regulating FRA was the defence intelligence act (SFS 2000:130); and the telecommunications act of 1993 (SFS 1993:597) required all companies operating a telecommunication network in Sweden to assist in government COMINT, under confidentiality. This act was replaced in 2003 by the electronic communications act (SFS 2003:389), as a result of changes in EU directives.\n\nThe new bill (Prop. 2006/07:63), informally known as the \"FRA law\" (), proposed changes in the defence intelligence act, the electronic communications act, the secrecy act of 1980 (SFS 1980:100), and the creation of an all new law regulating SIGINT. These changes would have allowed the FRA to monitor both wireless and cable bound signals passing the Swedish border without a court order, while also introducing several provisions designed to protect the privacy of individuals, according to the original proposal. The law's proponents argued for the need to give FRA new guidelines and a modernized legal framework, in order to regulate Internet surveillance and to combat threats to national security more effectively, such as terrorism and serious transnational crime; while opponents to the law claimed it enabled mass surveillance and violated privacy rights. The Riksdag passed the bill on June 18, 2008, after a heated debate amid public protests, and it went into effect January 1, 2009.\n\nCriticized for being too far-reaching, in an attempt to address the privacy concerns raised during the parliamentary procedure, the Government soon thereafter proposed an amendment to the law (Prop. 2008/09:201), to strengthen protection of privacy by making court orders a requirement, and imposing several limits on the intelligence-gathering. The amendment passed the Riksdag October 14, 2009, and went into effect December 1, 2009 (SFS 2008:717).\n\nAccording to the law (SFS 2008:717), SIGINT is only permitted in order to assess:\n\n\nThe FRA is not allowed to initialize any surveillance on their own, and only gets access to communication lines as decided by The Defence Intelligence Court. Communications service providers are legally required, under confidentiality, to transfer cable communications crossing Swedish borders to specific \"interaction points\", where data may be accessed after a court order. The number of companies affected by the legislation was estimated as \"being limited (approximately ten)\". The law does not permit intelligence-gathering by interception of signals where both the sender and recipient is located in Sweden, only signals crossing the borders of Sweden.\n\nInitially, only the Government, the Government Offices and the Swedish Armed Forces could use FRA's SIGINT capabilities. But after criticism from Swedish Security Service (SÄPO), a change was made allowing The Swedish National Police Board and SÄPO to make use of the FRA as well, under otherwise unchanged regulations. The bill (Prop. 2011/12:179) passed in the Riksdag November 28, 2012, with the help of the Social Democratic Party, and went into force January 1, 2013.\n\nAny personal data that may have been retained can not be stored for longer than 12 months, which is a year less than the maximum allowed by the Data Retention Directive. In 2008, prior to the change in legislation, a news report from SVT, based on an account from an anonymous source, alleged the FRA had been storing personal information for much longer; leading to a private citizen lodging a complaint with the police. Ultimately, a prosecutor did not launch a full-scale investigation, as it was deemed not illegal at the time.\n\nFRA is subject to regular reviews by several external government agencies.\n\nAll SIGINT has to be authorized by the Defence Intelligence Court (Swedish: \"\"), a special court based in Kista, independent of the FRA and appointed by the Government. It is composed of a chairman, assisted by one or two vice-chairmen, and 2-6 special members of the court, holding office for four years. The quorum of the court is a chairman and two special members, and each case is assessed and approved individually. A special ombudsman from the court is also tasked to monitor and argue for the privacy rights of individuals. The decisions of the court cannot be appealed, something that is motivated, in part, by information sensitivity and the fact that special knowledge and physical protection of infrastructure and documents is needed. A government agency of legal experts reviewed the amendment (Prop. 2008/09:201) in 2009, and did not express any objection:\n\nThe court has been led by former district court chairman Lieutenant Colonel Runar Viksten since 2009.\n\nThe Defence Intelligence Commission (Swedish: \"Statens inspektion för försvarsunderrättelseverksamheten\", SIUN) is the management authority tasked to supervise the FRA, ensuring it follows court orders issued by the Defence Intelligence Court, and that all laws and regulations governing FRA is followed, including privacy laws. SIUN obtains possession over all signals, and they are only made available to the FRA by permission of the court. Furthermore, the commission is obliged to launch an investigation whenever someone suspects they are the target of unauthorized SIGINT. The commission is not tasked or authorized to review decisions made by the court.\n\nThe Swedish Data Protection Authority is a public authority, organized under the Ministry of Justice, tasked to protect the individual's privacy. As such, it audits the FRA on how they process personal data. In December 2010, after a two-year-long audit, a special mission led by the board examining FRA concluded its operations are within bounds of applicable legislation.\n\nThe legislation allows for the transfer of data to other states, if authorized by the Government, enabling exchanges of intelligence. In return, Sweden could receive information of importance to the national interest, something the Director-General of FRA Ingvar Åkesson and the Minister for Foreign Affairs Carl Bildt both stressed when the legislation was debated in 2008.\n\nIn 2013, documents provided to the media by Edward Snowden appeared to confirm Sweden had shared intelligence with foreign intelligence agencies, revealing Sweden had provided the NSA with a \"unique collection on high-priority Russian targets such as leadership, internal politics, and energy.\" In response, Minister for Defence Karin Enström was quoted as saying that Sweden's intelligence exchange with other countries is \"critical for our security\" and that \"intelligence operations occur within a framework with clear legislation, strict controls and under parliamentary oversight.\" Anni Bölenius, head of communications at the FRA, told Reuters: \"We do in general have international cooperation with a number of countries, which is supported in Swedish legislation, but we do not comment on which ones we cooperate with\".\n\nThe FRA have been contested since the change in its legislation, mainly because of the public perception the change would enable mass surveillance. The FRA categorically deny this allegation. Anni Bölenius, head of communications at the FRA, believes the public perception of mass surveillance is incorrect, saying: \"It is not as we can turn on the traffic ourselves. We have to show cause and seek authorization.\"\n\nThe Social Democratic Party expressed their opposition to the legislation changes initially, but have since changed their views. In 2013, they provided support for an expansion of the law, to also include SÄPO and The Swedish National Police Board. This change comes after the amendment to the law, with the establishment of The Defence Intelligence Court and a narrowed scope, giving it more emphasis on defense intelligence. The court also hear each case on an individual basis, something Minister for Defence Sten Tolgfors have been quoted as saying, \"should render the debate on mass surveillance invalid.\"\n\n\nSimilar government agencies in other countries:\n\n"}
{"id": "24406", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24406", "title": "Parliament", "text": "Parliament\n\nIn modern politics and history, a parliament is a legislative body of government. Generally, a modern parliament has three functions: representing the electorate, making laws, and overseeing the government via hearings and inquiries.\n\nThe term is similar to the idea of a senate, synod or congress, and is commonly used in countries that are current or former monarchies, a form of government with a monarch as the head. Some contexts restrict the use of the word \"parliament\" to parliamentary systems, although it is also used to describe the legislature in some presidential systems (e.g. the French parliament), even where it is not in the official name.\n\nHistorically, parliaments included various kinds of deliberative, consultative, and judicial assemblies, e.g. mediaeval parlements.\n\nThe English term is derived from Anglo-Norman and dates to the 14th century, coming from the 11th century Old French , from \"parler\", meaning \"to talk\". The meaning evolved over time, originally referring to any discussion, conversation, or negotiation through various kinds of deliberative or judicial groups, often summoned by a monarch. By the 15th century, in Britain, it had come to specifically mean the legislature.\n\nSince ancient times, when societies were tribal, there were councils or a headman whose decisions were assessed by village elders. This is called tribalism. Some scholars suggest that in ancient Mesopotamia there was a primitive democratic government where the kings were assessed by council. The same has been said about ancient India, where some form of deliberative assemblies existed, and therefore there was some form of democracy. However, these claims are not accepted by most scholars, who see these forms of government as oligarchies.\n\nAncient Athens was the cradle of democracy. The Athenian assembly (, \"ekklesia\") was the most important institution, and every free male citizen could take part in the discussions. Slaves and women could not. However, Athenian democracy was not representative, but rather direct, and therefore the \"ekklesia\" was different from the parliamentary system.\n\nThe Roman Republic had legislative assemblies, who had the final say regarding the election of magistrates, the enactment of new statutes, the carrying out of capital punishment, the declaration of war and peace, and the creation (or dissolution) of alliances. The Roman Senate controlled money, administration, and the details of foreign policy.\n\nSome Muslim scholars argue that the Islamic shura (a method of taking decisions in Islamic societies) is analogous to the parliament. However, others highlight what they consider fundamental differences between the shura system and the parliamentary system.\n\nAlthough there are documented councils held in 873, 1020, 1050 and 1063, there was no representation of commoners. What is considered to be the first parliament (with the presence of commoners), the Cortes of León, was held in the Kingdom of León in 1188. According to the UNESCO, the Decreta of Leon of 1188 is the oldest documentary manifestation of the European parliamentary system. In addition, UNESCO granted the 1188 Cortes of Alfonso IX the title of \"Memory of the World\" and the city of Leon has been recognized as the \"Cradle of Parliamentarism\".\n\nAfter coming to power, King Alfonso IX, facing an attack by his two neighbors, Castile and Portugal, decided to summon the \"Royal Curia\". This was a medieval organisation composed of aristocrats and bishops but because of the seriousness of the situation and the need to maximise political support, Alfonso IX took the decision to also call the representatives of the urban middle class from the most important cities of the kingdom to the assembly. León's Cortes dealt with matters like the right to private property, the inviolability of domicile, the right to appeal to justice opposite the King and the obligation of the King to consult the Cortes before entering a war. Prelates, nobles and commoners met separately in the three estates of the Cortes. In this meeting new laws were approved to protect commoners against the arbitrarities of nobles, prelates and the king. This important set of laws is known as the \"Carta Magna Leonesa\".\n\nFollowing this event, new Cortes would appear in the other different territories that would make up Spain: Principality of Catalonia in 1192, the Kingdom of Castile in 1250, Kingdom of Aragon in 1274, Kingdom of Valencia in 1283 and Kingdom of Navarre in 1300.\n\nAfter the union of the Kingdoms of Leon and Castile under the Crown of Castile, their Cortes were united as well in 1258. The Castilian Cortes had representatives from Burgos, Toledo, León, Seville, Córdoba, Murcia, Jaén, Zamora, Segovia, Ávila, Salamanca, Cuenca, Toro, Valladolid, Soria, Madrid, Guadalajara and Granada (after 1492). The Cortes' assent was required to pass new taxes, and could also advise the king on other matters. The comunero rebels intended a stronger role for the Cortes, but were defeated by the forces of Habsburg Emperor Charles V in 1521. The Cortes maintained some power, however, though it became more of a consultative entity. However, by the time of King Philip II, Charles's son, the Castilian Cortes had come under functionally complete royal control, with its delegates dependent on the Crown for their income.\n\nThe Cortes of the Crown of Aragon kingdoms retained their power to control the king's spending with regard to the finances of those kingdoms. But after the War of the Spanish Succession and the victory of another royal house – the Bourbons – and King Philip V, their Cortes were suppressed (those of Aragon and Valencia in 1707, and those of Catalonia and the Balearic islands in 1714).\n\nClaims that Spain was united under the Catholic Monarchs in the late 15th century are belied by these facts; moreover, the very first Cortes representing the whole of Spain (and the Spanish empire of the day) did not assemble until 1812, in Cadiz, where it operated as a government in exile for, ironically, at that time most of the rest of Spain was in the hands of Napoleon's army.\n\nEngland has long had a tradition of a body of men who would assist and advise the king on important matters. Under the Anglo-Saxon kings, there was an advisory council, the Witenagemot. The name derives from the Old English ƿitena ȝemōt, or witena gemōt, for \"meeting of wise men\". The first recorded act of a witenagemot was the law code issued by King Æthelberht of Kent ca. 600, the earliest document which survives in sustained Old English prose; however, the witan was certainly in existence long before this time. The Witan, along with the folkmoots (local assemblies), is an important ancestor of the modern English parliament.\n\nAs part of the Norman Conquest of England, the new king, William I, did away with the Witenagemot, replacing it with a Curia Regis (\"King's Council\"). Membership of the Curia was largely restricted to the tenants in chief, the few nobles who \"rented\" great estates directly from the king, along with ecclesiastics. William brought to England the feudal system of his native Normandy, and sought the advice of the curia regis before making laws. This is the original body from which the Parliament, the higher courts of law, and the Privy Council and Cabinet descend. Of these, the legislature is formally the High Court of Parliament; judges sit in the Supreme Court of Judicature. Only the executive government is no longer conducted in a royal court.\n\nMost historians date the emergence of a parliament with some degree of power to which the throne had to defer no later than the rule of Edward I. Like previous kings, Edward called leading nobles and church leaders to discuss government matters, especially finance. A meeting in 1295 became known as the Model Parliament because it set the pattern for later Parliaments. The significant difference between the Model Parliament and the earlier Curia Regis was the addition of the Commons; that is, the inclusion of elected representatives of rural landowners and of townsmen. In 1307, Edward I agreed not to collect certain taxes without the consent of the realm. He also enlarged the court system.\n\nThe tenants-in-chief often struggled with their spiritual counterparts and with the king for power. In 1215, they secured from John the Magna Carta, which established that the king may not levy or collect any taxes (except the feudal taxes to which they were hitherto accustomed), save with the consent of a council. It was also established that the most important tenants-in-chief and ecclesiastics be summoned to the council by personal writs from the sovereign, and that all others be summoned to the council by general writs from the sheriffs of their counties. Modern government has its origins in the Curia Regis; parliament descends from the Great Council later known as the \"parliamentum\" established by Magna Carta.\n\nDuring the reign of King Henry III, 13th-Century English Parliaments incorporated elected representatives from shires and towns. These parliaments are, as such, considered forerunners of the modern parliament.\n\nIn 1265, Simon de Montfort, then in rebellion against Henry III, summoned a parliament of his supporters without royal authorization. The archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, and barons were summoned, as were two knights from each shire and two burgesses from each borough. Knights had been summoned to previous councils, but it was unprecedented for the boroughs to receive any representation. Come 1295, Edward I later adopted de Montfort's ideas for representation and election in the so-called \"Model Parliament\". At first, each estate debated independently; by the reign of Edward III, however, Parliament recognisably assumed its modern form, with authorities dividing the legislative body into two separate chambers.\n\nThe purpose and structure of Parliament in Tudor England underwent a significant transformation under the reign of Henry VIII. Originally its methods were primarily medieval, and the monarch still possessed a form of inarguable dominion over its decisions. According to Elton, it was Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex, then chief minister to Henry VIII, who initiated still other changes within parliament.\n\nThe Reformation Acts supplied Parliament with unlimited power over the country. This included authority over virtually every matter, whether social, economic, political, or religious ; it legalised the Reformation, officially and indisputably. The king had to rule through the council, not over it, and all sides needed to reach a mutual agreement when creating or passing laws, adjusting or implementing taxes, or changing religious doctrines. This was significant: the monarch no longer had sole control over the country. For instance, during the later years of Mary, Parliament exercised its authority in originally rejecting Mary's bid to revive Catholicism in the realm. Later on, the legislative body even denied Elizabeth her request to marry . If Parliament had possessed this power before Cromwell, such as when Wolsey served as secretary, the Reformation may never have happened, as the king would have had to gain the consent of all parliament members before so drastically changing the country's religious laws and fundamental identity .\n\nThe power of Parliament increased considerably after Cromwell's adjustments. It also provided the country with unprecedented stability. More stability, in turn, helped assure more effective management, organisation, and efficiency. Parliament printed statutes and devised a more coherent parliamentary procedure.\n\nThe rise of Parliament proved especially important in the sense that it limited the repercussions of dynastic complications that had so often plunged England into civil war. Parliament still ran the country even in the absence of suitable heirs to throne, and its legitimacy as a decision-making body reduced the royal prerogatives of kings like Henry VIII and the importance of their whims. For example, Henry VIII could not simply establish supremacy by proclamation; he required Parliament to enforce statutes and add felonies and treasons. An important liberty for Parliament was its freedom of speech; Henry allowed anything to be spoken openly within Parliament and speakers could not face arrest – a fact which they exploited incessantly. Nevertheless, Parliament in Henry VIII's time offered up very little objection to the monarch's desires. Under his and Edward's reign, the legislative body complied willingly with the majority of the kings' decisions.\n\nMuch of this compliance stemmed from how the English viewed and traditionally understood authority. As Williams described it, \"King and parliament were not separate entities, but a single body, of which the monarch was the senior partner and the Lords and the Commons the lesser, but still essential, members.\".\n\nAlthough its role in government expanded significantly during the reigns of Henry VIII and Edward VI, the Parliament of England saw some of its most important gains in the 17th century. A series of conflicts between the Crown and Parliament culminated in the execution of King Charles I in 1649. Afterward, England became a commonwealth, with Oliver Cromwell, its lord protector, the de facto ruler. Frustrated with its decisions, Cromwell purged and suspended Parliament on several occasions.\n\nA controversial figure accused of despotism, war crimes, and even genocide, Cromwell is nonetheless regarded as essential to the growth of democracy in England. The years of the Commonwealth, coupled with the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 and the subsequent Glorious Revolution of 1688, helped reinforce and strengthen Parliament as an institution separate from the Crown.\n\nThe Parliament of England met until it merged with the Parliament of Scotland under the Acts of Union. This union created the new Parliament of Great Britain in 1707.\n\nFrom the 10th century the Kingdom of Alba was ruled by chiefs (\"toisechs\") and subkings (\"mormaers\") under the suzerainty, real or nominal, of a High King. Popular assemblies, as in Ireland, were involved in law-making, and sometimes in king-making, although the introduction of tanistry—naming a successor in the lifetime of a king—made the second less than common. These early assemblies cannot be considered \"parliaments\" in the later sense of the word, and were entirely separate from the later, Norman-influenced, institution.\n\nThe Parliament of Scotland evolved during the Middle Ages from the King's Council of Bishops and Earls. The unicameral parliament is first found on record, referred to as a \"colloquium\", in 1235 at Kirkliston (a village now in Edinburgh).\n\nBy the early fourteenth century the attendance of knights and freeholders had become important, and from 1326 burgh commissioners attended. Consisting of the Three Estates; of clerics, lay tenants-in-chief and burgh commissioners sitting in a single chamber, the Scottish parliament acquired significant powers over particular issues. Most obviously it was needed for consent for taxation (although taxation was only raised irregularly in Scotland in the medieval period), but it also had a strong influence over justice, foreign policy, war, and all manner of other legislation, whether political, ecclesiastical, social or economic. Parliamentary business was also carried out by \"sister\" institutions, before c. 1500 by General Council and thereafter by the Convention of Estates. These could carry out much business also dealt with by Parliament – taxation, legislation and policy-making – but lacked the ultimate authority of a full parliament.\n\nThe parliament, which is also referred to as the Estates of Scotland, the Three Estates, the Scots Parliament or the auld Scots Parliament (Eng: \"old\"), met until the Acts of Union merged the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England, creating the new Parliament of Great Britain in 1707.\n\nFollowing the Scottish devolution referendum, 1997, and the passing of the Scotland Act 1998 by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the Scottish Parliament was reconvened on 1 July 1999, although with much more limited powers than its 18th-century predecessor. The parliament has sat since 2004 at its newly constructed Scottish Parliament Building in Edinburgh, situated at the foot of the Royal Mile, next to the royal palace of Holyroodhouse.\n\nA \"thing\" or \"ting\" (Old Norse and ; other modern Scandinavian: \"ting\", \"ding\" in Dutch) was the governing assembly in Germanic societies, made up of the free men of the community and presided by lawspeakers.\n\nThe thing was the assembly of the free men of a country, province or a hundred \"(hundare/härad/herred)\". There were consequently, hierarchies of things, so that the local things were represented at the thing for a larger area, for a province or land. At the thing, disputes were solved and political decisions were made. The place for the thing was often also the place for public religious rites and for commerce.\n\nThe thing met at regular intervals, legislated, elected chieftains and kings, and judged according to the law, which was memorised and recited by the \"law speaker\" (the judge).\n\nThe Icelandic, Faroese and Manx parliaments trace their origins back to the Viking expansion originating from the Petty kingdoms of Norway as well as Denmark, replicating Viking government systems in the conquered territories, such as those represented by the Gulating near Bergen in western Norway.\n\nLater national diets with chambers for different estates developed, e.g. in Sweden and in Finland (which was part of Sweden until 1809), each with a House of Knights for the nobility. In both these countries, the national parliaments are now called riksdag (in Finland also \"eduskunta\"), a word used since the Middle Ages and equivalent of the German word Reichstag.\n\nToday the term lives on in the official names of national legislatures, political and judicial institutions in the North-Germanic countries. In the Yorkshire and former Danelaw areas of England, which were subject to much Norse invasion and settlement, the wapentake was another name for the same institution.\n\nThe Sicilian Parliament, dating to 1097, evolved as the legislature of the Kingdom of Sicily.\n\nThe Federal Diet of Switzerland was one of the longest-lived representative bodies in history, continuing from the 13th century to 1848.\n\nOriginally, there was only the Parliament of Paris, born out of the Curia Regis in 1307, and located inside the medieval royal palace, now the Paris Hall of Justice. The jurisdiction of the \"Parliament\" of Paris covered the entire kingdom. In the thirteenth century, judicial functions were added. In 1443, following the turmoil of the Hundred Years' War, King Charles VII of France granted Languedoc its own \"parliament\" by establishing the \"Parliament\" of Toulouse, the first \"parliament\" outside of Paris, whose jurisdiction extended over the most part of southern France. From 1443 until the French Revolution several other \"parliaments\" were created in some provinces of France (Grenoble, Bordeaux).\n\nAll the \"parliaments\" could issue regulatory decrees for the application of royal edicts or of customary practices; they could also refuse to register laws that they judged contrary to fundamental law or simply as being untimely. Parliamentary power in France was suppressed more so than in England as a result of absolutism, and parliaments were eventually overshadowed by the larger Estates General, up until the French Revolution, when the National Assembly became the lower house of France's bicameral legislature.\n\nAccording to the \"Chronicles\" of Gallus Anonymus, the first legendary Polish ruler, Siemowit, who began the Piast Dynasty, was chosen by a \"wiec\". The \"veche\" (, ) was a popular assembly in medieval Slavic countries, and in late medieval period, a parliament. The idea of the \"wiec\" led in 1182 to the development of the Polish parliament, the \"Sejm\".\n\nThe term \"sejm\" comes from an old Polish expression denoting a meeting of the populace. The power of early sejms grew between 1146–1295, when the power of individual rulers waned and various councils and wiece grew stronger. The history of the national Sejm dates back to 1182. Since the 14th century irregular sejms (described in various Latin sources as \"contentio generalis, conventio magna, conventio solemna, parlamentum, parlamentum generale, dieta\" or Polish \"sejm walny\") have been called by Polish kings. From 1374, the king had to receive sejm permission to raise taxes. The General Sejm (Polish \"Sejm Generalny\" or \"Sejm Walny\"), first convoked by the king John I Olbracht in 1493 near Piotrków, evolved from earlier regional and provincial meetings (\"sejmiks\"). It followed most closely the \"sejmik generally\", which arose from the 1454 Nieszawa Statutes, granted to the szlachta (nobles) by King Casimir IV the Jagiellonian. From 1493 forward, indirect elections were repeated every two years. With the development of the unique Polish Golden Liberty the Sejm's powers increased.\n\nThe Commonwealth's general parliament consisted of three estates: the King of Poland (who also acted as the Grand Duke of Lithuania, Russia/Ruthenia, Prussia, Mazovia, etc.), the Senat (consisting of Ministers, Palatines, Castellans and Bishops) and the Chamber of Envoys—circa 170 nobles (szlachta) acting on behalf of their Lands and sent by Land Parliaments. Also representatives of selected cities but without any voting powers. Since 1573 at a royal election all peers of the Commonwealth could participate in the Parliament and become the King's electors.\n\nCossack Rada was the legislative body of a military republic of the Ukrainian Cossacks that grew rapidly in the 15th century from serfs fleeing the more controlled parts of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth. The republic did not regard social origin/nobility and accepted all people who declared to be Orthodox Christians.\n\nOriginally established at the Zaporizhian Sich, the rada (council) was an institution of Cossack administration in Ukraine from the 16th to the 18th century. With the establishment of the Hetman state in 1648, it was officially known as the General Military Council until 1750.\n\nThe zemsky sobor (Russian: зе́мский собо́р) was the first Russian parliament of the feudal Estates type, in the 16th and 17th centuries. The term roughly means assembly of the land.\n\nIt could be summoned either by tsar, or patriarch, or the Boyar Duma. Three categories of population, comparable to the Estates-General of France but with the numbering of the first two Estates reversed, participated in the assembly:\n\nNobility and high bureaucracy, including the Boyar Duma\n\nThe Holy Sobor of high Orthodox clergy\n\nRepresentatives of merchants and townspeople (third estate)\n\nThe name of the parliament of nowadays Russian Federation is the Federal Assembly of Russia. The term for its lower house, State Duma (which is better known than the Federal Assembly itself, and is often mistaken for the entirety of the parliament) comes from the Russian word \"думать\" (\"dumat\"), \"to think\". The Boyar Duma was an advisory council to the grand princes and tsars of Muscovy. The Duma was discontinued by Peter the Great, who transferred its functions to the Governing Senate in 1711.\n\nThe \"veche\" was the highest legislature and judicial authority in the republic of Novgorod until 1478. In its sister state, Pskov, a separate veche operated until 1510.\n\nSince the Novgorod revolution of 1137 ousted the ruling grand prince, the veche became the supreme state authority. After the reforms of 1410, the veche was restructured on a model similar to that of Venice, becoming the Commons chamber of the parliament. An upper Senate-like Council of Lords was also created, with title membership for all former city magistrates. Some sources indicate that veche membership may have become full-time, and parliament deputies were now called \"vechniks\". It is recounted that the Novgorod assembly could be summoned by anyone who rung the veche bell, although it is more likely that the common procedure was more complex. This bell was a symbol of republican sovereignty and independence. The whole population of the city—boyars, merchants, and common citizens—then gathered at Yaroslav's Court. Separate assemblies could be held in the districts of Novgorod. In Pskov the veche assembled in the court of the Trinity cathedral.\n\n\"Conciliarism\" or the \"conciliar movement\", was a reform movement in the 14th and 15th century Roman Catholic Church which held that final authority in spiritual matters resided with the Roman Church as corporation of Christians, embodied by a general church council, not with the pope. In effect, the movement sought – ultimately, in vain – to create an All-Catholic Parliament. Its struggle with the Papacy had many points in common with the struggle of parliaments in specific countries against the authority of Kings and other secular rulers.\n\nThe development of the modern concept of parliamentary government dates back to the Kingdom of Great Britain (1707–1800) and the parliamentary system in Sweden during the Age of Liberty (1718–1772).\n\nThe British Parliament is often referred to as the \"Mother of Parliaments\" (in fact a misquotation of John Bright, who remarked in 1865 that \"England is the Mother of Parliaments\") because the British Parliament has been the model for most other parliamentary systems, and its Acts have created many other parliaments. Many nations with parliaments have to some degree emulated the British \"three-tier\" model. Most countries in Europe and the Commonwealth have similarly organised parliaments with a largely ceremonial head of state who formally opens and closes parliament, a large elected lower house and a smaller, upper house.\n\nThe Parliament of Great Britain was formed in 1707 by the Acts of Union that replaced the former parliaments of England and Scotland. A further union in 1801 united the Parliament of Great Britain and the Parliament of Ireland into a Parliament of the United Kingdom.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Parliament consists of the House of Commons, the House of Lords, and the Monarch. The House of Commons is composed of 650 (soon to be 600) members who are directly elected by British citizens to represent single-member constituencies. The leader of a Party that wins more than half the seats, or less than half but is able to gain the support of smaller parties to achieve a majority in the house is invited by the Monarch to form a government. The House of Lords is a body of long-serving, unelected members: Lords Temporal – 92 of whom inherit their titles (and of whom 90 are elected internally by members of the House to lifetime seats), 588 of whom have been appointed to lifetime seats, and Lords Spiritual – 26 bishops, who are part of the house while they remain in office.\n\nLegislation can originate from either the Lords or the Commons. It is voted on in several distinct stages, called readings, in each house. First reading is merely a formality. Second reading is where the bill as a whole is considered. Third reading is detailed consideration of clauses of the bill.\n\nIn addition to the three readings a bill also goes through a committee stage where it is considered in great detail. Once the bill has been passed by one house it goes to the other and essentially repeats the process. If after the two sets of readings there are disagreements between the versions that the two houses passed it is returned to the first house for consideration of the amendments made by the second. If it passes through the amendment stage Royal Assent is granted and the bill becomes law as an Act of Parliament.\n\nThe House of Lords is the less powerful of the two houses as a result of the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949. These Acts removed the veto power of the Lords over a great deal of legislation. If a bill is certified by the Speaker of the House of Commons as a money bill (i.e. acts raising taxes and similar) then the Lords can only block it for a month. If an ordinary bill originates in the Commons the Lords can only block it for a maximum of one session of Parliament. The exceptions to this rule are things like bills to prolong the life of a Parliament beyond five years.\n\nIn addition to functioning as the second chamber of Parliament, the House of Lords was also the final court of appeal for much of the law of the United Kingdom—a combination of judicial and legislative function that recalls its origin in the Curia Regis. This changed in October 2009 when the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom opened and acquired the former jurisdiction of the House of Lords.\n\nSince 1999, there has been a Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh, which is a national, unicameral legislature for Scotland. However, the Scottish Parliament does not have complete power over Scottish Politics, as it only holds the powers which were devolved to it by Westminster in 1997. It cannot legislate on defence issues, currency, or national taxation (e.g. VAT, or Income Tax). Additionally, the Scottish Parliament can be dissolved at any given time by the British Parliament without the consent of the devolved government. This applies to all devolved governments within the United Kingdom, a limit on the sovereignty of the devolved governments.\n\nIn Sweden, the half-century period of parliamentary government beginning with Charles XII's death in 1718 and ending with Gustav III's self-coup in 1772 is known as the Age of Liberty. During this period, civil rights were expanded and power shifted from the monarch to parliament.\n\nWhile suffrage did not become universal, the taxed peasantry was represented in Parliament, although with little influence and commoners without taxed property had no suffrage at all.\n\nMany parliaments are part of a parliamentary system of government, in which the executive is constitutionally answerable to the parliament. Some restrict the use of the word \"parliament\" to parliamentary systems, while others use the word for any elected legislative body. Parliaments usually consist of \"chambers\" or \"houses\", and are usually either bicameral or unicameral although more complex models exist, or have existed (\"see Tricameralism).\n\nIn some parliamentary systems, the prime minister (PM) is a member of parliament (Britain), whereas in others not (Netherlands). They are commonly the leader of the majority party in the lower house of parliament, but only hold the office as long as the \"confidence of the house\" is maintained. If members of the lower house lose faith in the leader for whatever reason, they can call a vote of no confidence and force the PM to resign.\n\nThis can be particularly dangerous to a government when the distribution of seats among different parties is relatively even, in which case a new election is often called shortly thereafter. However, in case of general discontent with the head of government, their replacement can be made very smoothly without all the complications that it represents in the case of a presidential system.\n\nThe parliamentary system can be contrasted with a presidential system, such as the American congressional system, which operates under a stricter separation of powers, whereby the executive does not form part of, nor is it appointed by, the parliamentary or legislative body. In such a system, congresses do not select or dismiss heads of governments, and governments cannot request an early dissolution as may be the case for parliaments. Some states, such as France, have a semi-presidential system which falls between parliamentary and congressional systems, combining a powerful head of state (president) with a head of government, the prime minister, who is responsible to parliament.\n\n\n\nAustralia's States and territories:\n\nIn the federal (bicameral) kingdom of Belgium, there is a curious asymmetrical constellation serving as directly elected legislatures for three \"territorial\" \"regions\"—Flanders (Dutch), Brussels (bilingual, certain peculiarities of competence, also the only region not comprising any of the 10 provinces) and Wallonia (French)—and three cultural \"communities\"—Flemish (Dutch, competent in Flanders and for the Dutch-speaking inhabitants of Brussels), Francophone (French, for Wallonia and for Francophones in Brussels) and German (for speakers of that language in a few designated municipalities in the east of the Walloon Region, living alongside Francophones but under two different regimes)\n\nCanada's provinces and territories:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14871469", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14871469", "title": "Photography and the law", "text": "Photography and the law\n\nThe intellectual property rights on photographs are protected in different jurisdictions by the laws governing copyright and moral rights. In some cases photography may be restricted by civil or criminal law. Publishing certain photographs can be restricted by privacy or other laws. Photography can be generally restricted in the interests of public morality and the protection of children.\n\nReactions to photography differ between societies, and even where there are no official restrictions there may be objections to photographing people or places. Reactions may range from complaints to violence for photography which is not illegal.\n\nIn the United Kingdom there are no laws forbidding photography of private property from a public place. Photography on private land is not restricted if the landowner has given permission. However, landowners are permitted to impose any conditions they wish upon entry to a property, including forbidding or restricting photography. Two public locations in the UK, Trafalgar Square and Parliament Square, have a specific provision against photography for commercial purposes without the written permission of the Mayor, or the Squares' Management Team and paying a fee, and permission is needed to photograph or film for commercial purposes in the Royal Parks.\n\nPersistent or aggressive photography of a single individual may come under the legal definition of harassment.\n\nIt is contempt of court, a criminal offence, to take a photograph in any court of law of any person, being a judge of the court or a juror or a witness in or a party to any proceedings before the court, whether civil or criminal, or to publish such a photograph. This includes photographs taken in a court building or the precincts of the court.\nTaking a photograph in a court can be seen as a serious offence, leading to a prison sentence. The prohibition on taking photographs in the precincts is vague. It was designed to prevent the undermining of the dignity of the court, through the exploitation of images in low brow \"picture papers\".\n\nPhotography of certain subject matter is restricted in the United Kingdom. In particular, the Protection of Children Act 1978 restricts making or possessing pornography of children under 18, or what looks like pornography of under-18s. There is no law prohibiting photographing children in public spaces.\n\nIt is an offence under the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008 to publish or communicate a photograph of a constable (not including PCSOs), a member of the armed forces, or a member of the security services, which is of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism. There is a defence of acting with a reasonable excuse; however, the burden of proof is on the defence, under section 58A of the Terrorism Act 2000. A PCSO in 2009 cited Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 to prevent a member of the public photographing him. Section 44 actually concerns stop and search powers. However, in January 2010 the stop-and-search powers granted under Section 44 were ruled illegal by the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nFollowing a prolonged campaign, including a series of demonstrations by photographers dealt with by police officers and PCSOs, the Metropolitan Police was forced to issue updated legal advice which confirms that \"Members of the public and the media do not need a permit to film or photograph in public places and police have no power to stop them filming or photographing incidents or police personnel\" and that \"The power to stop and search someone under Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 no longer exists.\"\n\nIt is an offence under section 58 of the Terrorism Act 2000 to take a photograph of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism, or possessing such a photograph. There is an identical defence of reasonable excuse. This offence (and possibly, but not necessarily the offence) covers only a photograph as described in of the Terrorism Act 2006. As such, it must be of a kind likely to provide practical assistance to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism. Whether the photograph in question is such is a matter for a jury, which is not required to look at the surrounding circumstances. The photograph must contain information of such a nature as to raise a reasonable suspicion that it was intended to be used to assist in the preparation or commission of an act of terrorism. It must call for an explanation. A photograph which is innocuous on its face will not fall foul of the provision if the prosecution adduces evidence that it was intended to be used for the purpose of committing or preparing a terrorist act. The defence may prove a reasonable excuse simply by showing that the photograph is possessed for a purpose other than to assist in the commission or preparation of an act of terrorism, even if the purpose of possession is otherwise unlawful.\n\nCopyright can subsist in an original photograph, i.e. a recording of light or other radiation on any medium on which an image is produced or from which an image by any means be produced, and which is not part of a film. Whilst photographs are classified as artistic works, the subsistence of copyright does not depend on artistic merit. The owner of the copyright in the photograph is the photographer – the person who creates it, by default. However, where a photograph is taken by an employee in the course of employment, the first owner of the copyright is the employer, unless there is an agreement to the contrary.\n\nCopyright which subsists in a photograph protects not merely the photographer from direct copying of his/her work, but also from indirect copying to reproduce his/her work, where a substantial part of his/her work has been copied.\n\nCopyright in a photograph lasts for 70 years from the end of the year in which the photographer dies. A consequence of this lengthy period of existence of the copyright is that many family photographs which have no market value, but significant emotional value, remain subject to copyright, even when the original photographer cannot be traced (a problem known as copyright orphan), has given up photography, or died. In the absence of a licence, it will be an infringement of copyright in the photographs to copy them. When someone dies the rights will have transferred to someone else, perhaps through testamentary deposition (a will) or by inheritance. If there was no will, or if the photographer has not specified where the rights in the material should go, then the normal rules of inheritance will apply (although these rules are not specific to copyright and legal advice should be sought). Scanning old family photographs, without permission, to a digital file for personal use is prima facie an infringement of copyright.\n\nCertain photographs may not be protected by copyright. Section 171(3) of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 gives courts jurisdiction to refrain from enforcing the copyright which subsists in works on the grounds of public interest. For example, patent diagrams are held to be in the public domain, and are thus not subject to copyright.\n\nInfringement of the copyright which subsists in a photograph can be performed through copying the photograph. This is because the owner of the copyright in the photograph has the exclusive right to copy the photograph. For there to be infringement of the copyright in a photograph, there must be copying of a substantial part of the photograph.\nA photograph can also be a mechanism of infringement of the copyright which subsists in another work. For example, a photograph which copies a substantial part of an artistic work, such as a sculpture, painting or another photograph (without permission) would infringe the copyright which subsists in those works.\n\nHowever, the subject matter of a photograph is not necessarily subject to an independent copyright. For example, in the Creation Records case, a photographer, attempting to create a photograph for an album cover, set up an elaborate and artificial scene. A photographer from a newspaper covertly photographed the scene and published it in the newspaper. The court held that the newspaper photographer did not infringe the official photographer's copyright. Copyright did not subsist in the scene itself – it was too temporary to be a collage, and could not be categorised as any other form of artistic work.\n\nRichard Arnold has criticized the protection of photographs in this manner on two grounds. Firstly, it is argued that photographs should not be protected as artistic works, but should instead be protected in a manner similar to that of sound recordings and films. In other words, copyright should not protect the subject matter of a photograph as a matter of course as a consequence of a photograph being taken. It is argued that protection of photographs as artistic works is anomalous, in that photography is ultimately a medium of reproduction, rather than creation. As such, it is more similar to a film, or sound recording than a painting or sculpture. Some photographers share this view. For example, Michael Reichmann described photography as an art of disclosure, as opposed to an art of inclusion. Secondly, it is argued that the protection of photographs as artistic works leads to bizarre results. Subject matter is protected irrespective of the artistic merit of a photograph. The subject matter of a photograph is protected even when it is not deserving of protection. For copyright to subsist in photographs as artistic works, the photographs must be original, since the English test for originality is based on skill, labour and judgment. That said, it is possible that the threshold of originality is very low. Essentially, by this, Arnold is arguing that whilst the subject matter of some photographs may deserve protection, it is inappropriate for the law to presume that the subject matter of all photographs is deserving of protection.\n\nIt is possible to say with a high degree of confidence that photographs of three-dimensional objects, including artistic works, will be treated by a court as themselves original artistic works, and as such, will be subject to copyright. It is likely that a photograph (including a scan – digital scanning counts as photography for the purposes of the Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988) of a two dimensional artistic work, such as another photograph or a painting will also be subject to copyright if a significant amount of skill, labour and judgment went into its creation.\n\nA right to privacy came into existence in UK law as a consequence of the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into domestic law through the Human Rights Act 1998. This can result in restrictions on the publication of photography.\n\nWhether this right is caused by horizontal effect of the Human Rights Act 1998 or is judicially created is a matter of some controversy. The right to privacy is protected by Article 8 of the convention. In the context of photography, it stands at odds to the Article 10 right of freedom of expression. As such, courts will consider the public interest in balancing the rights through the legal test of proportionality.\n\nA very limited statutory right to privacy exists in the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. This right is held, for example, by someone who hires a photographer to photograph their wedding. The commissioner, irrespective of any copyright which he does or does not hold in the photograph, of a photograph which was commissioned for private and domestic purposes, where copyright subsists in the photograph, has the right not to have copies of the work issued to the public, the work exhibited in public or the work communicated to the public. However, this right will not be infringed if the rightholder gives permission. It will not be infringed if the photograph is incidentally included in an artistic work, film, or broadcast.\n\nLocal, state, and national laws govern still and motion photography. Laws vary between jurisdictions, and what is not illegal in one place may be illegal in another. Typical laws in the United States are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal legislation governs the questions of copyright and criminal offences with respect to photography. Otherwise, the common law (except, in the case of Quebec, the \"Civil Code of Quebec\"), generally determines when photography can take place.\n\nIn some public property owned by government, such as law courts, government buildings, libraries, civic centres and some of the museums in Hong Kong, photography is not allowed without permission from the government. It is illegal to equip or take photographs and recording in a place of public entertainment, such as cinemas and indoor theaters.\n\nIn private property, photography may be prohibited or restricted by a property owner on their property.\n\nPhotography on private property that is generally open to the public (e.g., a shopping mall) is usually permitted unless explicitly prohibited by posted signs. Even if no such signs are posted, the property owner or agent can ask a person to stop photographing, and if the person refuses to do so, the owner or agent can ask the person to leave; in some jurisdictions, a person who refuses to leave can be arrested for criminal trespass, and many jurisdictions recognize the common-law right to use reasonable force to remove a trespasser; a person who forcibly resists a lawful removal may be liable for battery, assault, or both.\n\nIn Hungary, from 15 March 2014 when the long-awaited Civil Code was published, the law re-stated what had been normal practice, namely, that a person had the right to refuse being photographed. However, implied consent exists: it is not illegal to photograph a person who does not actively object.\n\nIn Macau, a photographer must not take or publish any photographs of a person against his/her will without legal justification, even in a public place. Besides, everyone has a right to Personality Rights. People are not to be photographed, photographs of them displayed or reproduced without their prior consent. Criminal penalties include imprisonment. Additionally, photography of police officers in Macau is illegal.\n\nIn South Africa photographing people in public is legal. Reproducing and selling photographs of people is legal for editorial and limited fair use commercial purposes. There exists no case law to define what the limits on commercial use are. Civil law requires the consent of any identifiable persons for advertorial and promotional purposes. Property, including animals, do not enjoy any special consideration.\n\nDuring the media coverage of the Nkandla controversy it emerged that there exists a law, the National Key Points Act, 1980, prohibiting the photographing of any \"national key points.\" National key points are buildings or structures that serve a strategic or military purpose. Though it wasn't revealed what these are as part of state secrecy it was claimed that the presidential residence is one of them and should thus not be shown in media. Subsequent court action resulted in it being ruled that a list of all key points be made public. Although not currently or previously enforced the law is still in effect even after calls for it to be repealed as a relic of apartheid-era secrecy legislation.\n\nTravelers who wish to take any photographs must obtain a photography permit from the Ministry of Interior, Department of Aliens (Sudan) or Ministry of Information (South Sudan).\n\nRegulations apply to land-based photography for certain locations. A permit is required for aerial photography in India, which normally takes over a month to be issued.\n\nCalling oneself a photographer, in line with most other trades in Iceland, requires the person to hold a Journeyman's or Master's Certificates in the industry. Exceptions can be made in low population areas, or for people coming from within the EEA.\n\nTaking pictures of police officers in many circumstances was made illegal by a 2015 \"Citizens' Security Law\" with the stated purpose of protecting police officers and their families from harassment. The law has generated controversy because it may be harder to denounce police brutality. A far more limited version of the law had been in effect for several decades regarding when police work related to terrorism. A person was fined under this law for taking and publishing online a photograph of an illegally parked police car.\n\nMexican law is similar to the law in the United States. Authorities may intimidate or prevent any holder of a camera if they come into close perimeters of Government buildings.\n\nIn South Korea, taking pictures of women without their consent, even in public, is considered to be criminal sexual assault, punishable by a fine of under 10 million won and up to 5 years imprisonment. In July 2017 an amendment to the law was voted on in favour of allowing for chemical castration of people taking such photographs.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "36708276", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36708276", "title": "Student Bill of Rights", "text": "Student Bill of Rights\n\nA Student Bill of Rights or Charter of Student Rights and Freedoms is a document adopted by a student group, university or college or government at a local, state or national level. It outlines a population's basic beliefs regarding student rights. These statements of belief are often the foundation for future legislative efforts or collaborative efforts to create joint statements between organizations. The European Student Union, for example, uses their Student Rights Charter when lobbying for student rights in the European Union Higher Education Area as a document representing the student will. The historic National Student Association in the United States used their Student Bill of Rights to help create dialogue between the American Association of University Professors and to initiate the creation of a joint statement on student rights. This collaborative effort gave credence to the demands of students and helped normalize student rights on campuses across North America. While the United States Student Association does not have a student bill of rights of its own, it upholds the 1947 student bill of rights put forth by the National Student Association.\n\nThese documents tend to do several things. They can be statements of belief, policy or law. When put forth by a student organization or third party organization they tend to be statements of belief because these organizations do not often have the ability to enforce their beliefs. Even though they are not legally binding they are important because they help policy and lawmakers understand what students expect and believe to be ethical treatment. At the institutional level they tend to be policy statements. These are legally binding as a promise from the institution to the students who attend and have been found in court to be considered to be part of the educational contract.\n\nAt any level these documents provide students with an understanding of their civil or legal rights which are already contained in legislation. These include rights pertinent to all citizens and also to students in the educational setting and provide procedural rights to inform students how institutions should be respecting their legal rights. When used as a statement of belief, however, they often include rights an organization feels students should have and the procedural rights institutions must follow to ensure these rights are fulfilled. There are currently a number of student petitions calling for the creation of national student bills in various countries. While there have been some attempts to create subject specific student bills in the United States, like the Academic Bill of Rights, these have not been successful due primarily for demand for a document which is wider in scope and deals with students constitutional, civil, contractual and consumer rights.\n\nNo country in North America has yet adopted a National Student Bill of Rights, Charter of Rights and Freedoms or Code of Rights and Responsibilities.\n\nIn the United States there have been several national student bill of rights drafted by student organizations including the historic National Student Association and the American Association of University Professors and other non-governmantal organizations but as yet none have been legally institutionalized.\n\nIn 1947 the National Student Association NSA in the United States adopted a student bill of rights. The text of this document is not easily accessible. In 1967, however, the NSA put forth a joint statement on the rights and freedoms of students with the American Association of University Professors AAUP (now the Association of American Colleges and Universities). This statement was endorsed by a number of professional organizations. This document included the following rights:\n\nConstitutional Rights\nSpeech and Association Rights\nDue Process Rights\nClassroom Rights\n\nThe United States Student Association does not have an official student bill of rights. The USSA was formed when the historic NSA merged with the National Student Lobby NSL in 1978. They did not officially adopt the student bill of rights put forth in 1947. They text of this document is not on their website and cannot easily be found with a search of the internet.\n\nIn 2003, Georgia Congressman Kingston proposed the first national student bill of rights, House Bill #318. This bill, which was rejected in congress, was not an all encompassing student bill of rights but was narrowly defined to address academic freedom. Nevertheless, it was the first attempt at the creation of national legislation. The congressman found that \"at almost every American university, conservative professors are drastically outnumbered.\" This bill was intended to secure the intellectual freedom of students and faculty. It did not address whether teachers would have the freedom to determine all course goals, curriculum, assignments, grading schemes and course timeline. These issues are of major importance because students in Europe are calling for rights which protect students from teachers having complete academic freedom in the classroom and which regulate them to ensure students have minimum educational quality standards.\n\nIn the United States individual institutions often have their own Student Bill of Rights, Charter of Rights and Freedoms or Code of Rights and Responsibilities. In elementary and secondary education these codes are often drafted by school board officials with perhaps the input of parent or parent teacher associations. In post secondary institutions these are often drafted by the academic senate with the contribution of student representatives. This process often includes varying degrees of student input from student surveys to no student voice and the academic senate may have as much as 50% student representation or as little as 0% student representation depending on the structure of the institution.\n\nThe Canadian Federation of Students has yet to accept a student bill or rights, code of rights and responsibilities or a charter of rights and freedoms. The Canadian Encyclopedia, which details issues of Canadian life and governance, however, states that in Canada \"Basically 2 sorts of rights apply to students: substantive rights - the actual rights that students should enjoy - and procedural rights - methods by which students claim their rights. This article is concerned with students in public institutions, although those in private schools can claim rights under the common law and provincial education Acts.\"\n\nIn the 1960s, the Canadian Union of Students had adopted the Declaration on the Canadian Student, a declaration aimed defining the rights and role of a student. The Declaration was adopted at the September 1965 annual meeting of the CUS, and was initiated mainly by the Students' Union of the University of Ottawa President Jock Turcot. A year later, the CUS re-affirmed the \"fundamental philosophy\" behind the Declaration.\n\nIn 2008 the European Student Union adopted a Student Rights Charter which is in essence their platform. This document includes those rights and freedoms which members of the European student Union are lobbying for in their own countries. Romania currently has the strongest student rights legislation in the European Union and this is in part to do with the efforts of the European Student Union to press for legislation. The 2008 ESU Student Rights Charter includes the following rights:\n\nAccess to Higher Education\nStudent Involvement\nExtracurricular Aspect of Study\nCurricular Aspect of Study\n\nRomania is the country which has the greatest student rights legislation currently in place. In 2010 the National Alliance of student organizations in Romania, which is also part of the European Student Union, and the Romanian Students' Union(USR) worked with the Romanian National Government to bring into law the Romanian National Student Code of Rights and Responsibilities. This document provides Romanian students with roughly a hundred which theoretical rights and procedural rights necessary to ensure theoretical rights are fulfilled. This document includes the following rights:\n\nEducational Package Rights\nContract Rights\nEquitability Rights\nAccountability & Quality Assurance Rights\nDue Process Rights\nInformation Accessibility Rights\n\nIt does not seem that Asia has any national or continental student rights bills in place.\n\nIt does not seem that Africa has any national or continental student rights bills in place.\n\nIt does not seem that South or Central America has any national or continental student rights bills in place.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a three-story Georgian-style mansion that was built as a private home for William Ridley Wills and his family in 1929. It is on a tract about south of the Tennessee State Capitol in Nashville. The state purchased the house in 1949 and it has served as the home of Tennessee's governors since then. \n\nThe first renovation since the residence was purchased by the state was completed during the spring of 2010. The project was initiated in 2005 by Andrea Conte, the wife of then-Governor Phil Bredesen. For years, maintenance had been deferred by governors wary of alienating voters. Prior to the renovation, the slate roof leaked, ceiling and wall plaster had many cracks, lead-based paint was peeling, and the residence was still heated and cooled by the original hot and cold water radiator system. Two other major problems were the relative lack of accessibility for disabled persons, and inadequate formal dining/gathering space. The formal dining room seated only 22 people, but state dinners often had more than 50 guests. In those situations, tents were erected on the front lawn along with port-o-let toilets for the guests of state to use. \n\nTo address these problems, the Memphis-based architectural firm Archimania was selected to design what was to be named Conservation Hall, which was completed during the spring of 2010. It is a mainly underground dining and meeting room capable of seating 160 people. The center of Conservation Hall is a glass-walled oval atrium that opens to the sky. It is Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)-certified, the first governor's residence to be given the LEED designation. \n\nThe house is open to the public for tours by advance reservation.\n\n"}

International Boxing Club of New York, Inc.\n\nUnited States v. International Boxing Club of New York, 348 U.S. 236 (1955), often referred to as International Boxing Club or just International Boxing, was an antitrust decision of the U.S. Supreme Court. By a 7–2 margin, the justices ruled that the exemption it had previously upheld for Major League Baseball was peculiar and unique to that sport and that it did not apply to boxing. Since it met the definition of interstate commerce, the government could therefore proceed with a trial to prove IBCNY and the other defendants had conspired to monopolize the market for championship boxing in the United States.\n\nIt was the first time another sport had argued it was covered by the same exemption as baseball by virtue of being a professional sport. Chief Justice Earl Warren, writing for the majority, admitted that it would never have reached the Court but for the baseball exemption, and dissenting justices Felix Frankfurter and Sherman Minton were unsparing in their criticism of the arbitrary nature of this distinction.\n\nThe case was remanded for trial, which the government won, forcing the breakup of some of the defendant companies. An appeal of that decision also was ultimately decided by the Supreme Court four years later, upholding the wide discretion and scope of district court judges in shaping remedies for antitrust violations.\n\nIn January 1949 James D. Norris and Arthur Wirtz, who controlled boxing at several major arenas including Madison Square Garden, Chicago Stadium and Detroit Olympia, paid the recently retired Joe Louis $100,000 for four fighters he managed. They agreed that those fighters would fight it out among themselves for the new heavyweight title, and in return fight only in matches Norris and Wirtz promoted for several years.\n\nThis gave them an effective monopoly on all major boxing matches save those in the flyweight and bantamweight divisions. From 1949 to 1955 all but two championship fights took place under their control. They also secured exclusive television contracts for twice-weekly fights at the Garden, at a time when boxing was increasingly coming to depend on television revenues.\n\nThe Justice Department began investigating for possible antitrust violations and brought the IBCNY to trial in the Southern District of New York under the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1953. Before it started, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, citing the Court's recent decision in \"Toolson v. New York Yankees\" () to uphold the antitrust exemption granted Major League Baseball in 1922's \"Federal Baseball Club v. National League\" (). Like baseball, they reasoned, the interstate travel required to facilitate boxing was incidental to the staging of fights and thus boxing was not subject to antitrust law as it was not interstate commerce.\n\nThe district court granted the motion. Immediately afterward, the government appealed the dismissal directly to the Supreme Court under the Expediting Act.\n\nChief Justice Earl Warren wrote for the majority. Felix Frankfurter and Sherman Minton dissented, with Minton signing Frankfurter's opinion as well.\n\n\"The question is perhaps a novel one in that this Court has never before considered the antitrust status of the boxing business\", Warren wrote. \"Yet, if it were not for \"Federal Baseball\" and \"Toolson\", we think that it would be too clear for dispute that the Government's allegations bring the defendants within the scope of the Act.\" Boxing clearly involved interstate arrangements, he said, particularly with broadcasting involved, and as early as \"Hart v. B.F. Keith Vaudeville Exchange\" () the Court had been clear that baseball's antitrust exemption could not be claimed by any other business.\n\nPrior to the Court's consideration of \"Toolson\", he recalled, Congress had considered and rejected other bills intended specifically to genericize the baseball exemption. \"The issue confronting us is therefore not whether a previously granted exemption should continue,\" he concluded, \"but whether an exemption should be granted in the first instance. And that issue is for Congress to resolve, not this Court.\"\n\n\"It would baffle the subtlest ingenuity to find a single differentiating factor between other sporting exhibitions, whether boxing or football or tennis, and baseball\", Frankfurter began. The \"Toolson\" majority, which he had been part of, had applied \"stare decisis\", the legal doctrine under which flawed decisions can be upheld as the lesser of two evils. But here he found his colleagues irrational and inconsistent.\n\nMinton, too, saw flawed logic. Unlike Frankfurter, he believed that boxing generally did not constitute interstate commerce, noting that the broadcasters and sponsors had not been named as defendants by the government, and that the Court was turning \"Federal Baseball\"s conclusion on its head.\nHe conceded that Louis had a monopoly on the championship when he retired and gave the defendants exclusives on the four fighters' championship contests, but from competition in the ring, not the marketplace. \"As I see it, boxing is not trade or commerce. There can be no monopoly or restraint of nonexistent commerce or trade\", he concluded.\n\nThe antitrust suit proceeded and the government won. The IBCNY appealed the divestitures proposed by the judge as having gone past the original offense, and that case came to the Supreme Court again as \"International Boxing Club of New York v. United States\" (). Again the justices ruled in the government's favor, and Norris and Wirtz dissolved the organization and sold their interest in the other defendant organizations.\n\nWhile they left boxing, they remained involved in professional sports as owners of the Chicago Blackhawks National Hockey League franchise. Wirtz's grandson Rocky is today the team's principal owner.\n\n"}
{"id": "50560685", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50560685", "title": "United States v. United States Gypsum Co.", "text": "United States v. United States Gypsum Co.\n\nUnited States v. United States Gypsum Co. was a patent–antitrust case in which the United States Supreme Court decided, first, in 1948, that a patent licensing program that fixed prices of many licensees and regimented an entire industry violated the antitrust laws, and then, decided in 1950, after a remand, that appropriate relief in such cases did not extend so far as to permit licensees enjoying a compulsory, reasonable–royalty license to challenge the validity of the licensed patents. The Court also ruled, in \"obiter dicta\", that the United States had standing to challenge the validity of patents when a patentee relied on the patents to justify its fixing prices. It held in this case, however, that the defendants violated the antitrust laws irrespective of whether the patents were valid, which made the validity issue irrelevant.\n\nThe corporate defendants are manufacturers of gypsum products, including gypsum plasterboard, gypsum lath, gypsum wallboard, and gypsum plaster. they sold nearly all of the first three products marketed in states east of the Rocky Mountains (\"the eastern area\"), and a substantial portion of the plaster sold in the same area, with annual sales of approximately $42 million. Since its organization in 1901, United States Gypsum has been the dominant concern in the gypsum industry. In 1939, it sold 55% of all gypsum board in the eastern area.\n\nBy internal development and purchase from others, United States Gypsum acquired the most significant patents covering the manufacture of gypsum board. Beginning in 1926, United States Gypsum offered licenses under its patents to other manufacturers in the industry. Since 1929, all of United States Gypsum's licenses contained a provision that United States Gypsum should fix the minimum price at which the licensee sold gypsum products embodying the patents. Since 1929, United States Gypsum has fixed prices at which the other corporate defendants have sold their gypsum board.\n\nPrior to 1912, gypsum board was manufactured with an open edge, leaving the gypsum core exposed on all four sides. In 1912, United States Gypsum acquired a patent covering both process and product claims on gypsum board with closed edges, the paper liner being folded over the exposed gypsum core. Closed-edge board was superior in quality to open-edge board, as it was cheaper to manufacture, did not break so easily in shipment, and was less subject to crumbling at the edges when nailed in place. Subsequently, United States Gypsum acquired a number of other patents relating to the process of making closed-edge board.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930, United States Gypsum sued a number of gypsum board manufacturers for patent infringement, prevailed in the litigation, and settled with the defendants by granting them licenses with price-fixing clauses. Since 1937 United States Gypsum has maintained rigid control over the price and terms of sale of all gypsum board. The license agreements provided that royalties should be paid on the sales of all board sold, patented or unpatented. This provision tended to discourage any production of unpatented board because it was more costly to manufacture than the patented board.\n\nIn August 1940 the United States Government filed a civil antitrust complaint against United States Gypsum and the other defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The complaint charges that the defendants have been engaged in a combination and conspiracy in restraint of trade and commerce in gypsum products, which the defendants \"carried out in connection with certain patent license agreements based on patents owned by the United States Gypsum Company covering the manufacture of gypsum board.\" The defendants relied on these patents as a legitimate basis for \"establishing prices and terms of sale of gypsum board within the doctrine of \"United States v. General Electric Company\", 1926, 272 U.S. 476.\"\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the court addressed the question whether the Government had standing to seek invalidation of a patent because it was used as a means of fixing prices and committing other antitrust violations. In this connection, the government pointed to the provisions in the licenses that forbid the licensees from challenging the validity of the licensed patents. \"[I]n the circumstances of the instant case,\" the Government said, \"no one outside the group of licensee defendants is likely to hazard the expense necessary to make an effective challenge against 'a powerful combination carefully fenced in behind, not one, but many patents in the art.' \" The court rejected the argument, maintaining that \"there is nothing inherently unclean about an agreement by a licensee not to contest the validity of his licensor's patent.\" More fundamentally, the court said, \"The attack upon the validity of the patents under paragraph 46(a) involves a breach, as between the Government and the patentees and those dealing with the patentees, of the Government's grant.\" It is a \"broken promise.\" It does not matter that the patents were allegedly misused to restrain trade. \"That the defendants may be shown to have misused the patents is no warrant for the Government's repudiating its own assurance that they were issued upon due examination and according to law and conferred an exclusive right for a given period of years.\"\n\nThe case then proceeded to trial and the Government offered its evidence. The trial began in November 1943 and continued, with interruptions, to April 1944. At the close of the Government's case the defendants moved to strike from the record all of the exhibits and testimony received subject to connection, on the ground that no \"prima facie\" showing of any conspiracy had been made, that such exhibits and testimony had not been shown to be in furtherance or in execution of any conspiracy, and that such exhibits had not otherwise been connected to the alleged conspiracy. The defendants moved also to dismiss the complaint on the ground that upon the facts and the law the plaintiff had shown no right to relief. By an order dated June 15, 1946, the court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss.\n\nThe court said that there were two principal issues of fact in the case. The first is whether the license agreements entered into by the defendants were \"bona fide patent license agreements\" or instead just entered into ’to give color of legality to a combination to restrain trade in violation of the Sherman Act.\" The court said the licenses were patterned after the GE–Westinghouse agreements of the 1926 \"General Electric\" case, \"which in that case were sanctioned by the Supreme Court.\" The court said that the \"\"General Electric\" decision holds that this is not illegal.\" The court observed that attorneys for the corporate defendants told them \"that license agreements giving price control to the licensor were proper and that they had a right to enter into them under the patent laws.\" The court also concluded that the licensees entered into the license agreements in good faith and \"not as sham agreements to disguise illegal purposes.\"\n\nThe court then asked:\n\nThe court said:\n\n[Some licensees] were no doubt in part motivated not only by the desire to make closed-edge board and to settle or avoid litigation, but also by the expectation that the exercise of its price fixing right by USG as licensor would result in a price advance. . . . Indeed, it is not in dispute that it was the hope and expectation of the several prospective licensees that board prices would advance, and that they would be stabilized in the sense that each licensee together with the licensor would be selling, at a given time, at the minimum prices fixed by the licensor.\n\nBut that does bot show intent to fix prices, the court said. \"It is not illegal for parties negotiating a patent license agreement to hope, expect, or intend that the normal economic consequences of patent licensing will follow execution of the license,\" i.e., \"a stabilized and presumably profitable price for the patented product.\" In short, the court said. \"We conclude in respect of the second aspect of the first question of fact in the case that the evidence fails to show that the license agreements were executed with intent to gain objectives beyond the proper limits of a patent monopoly in any of the respects charged.\" The court also concluded \"that the evidence fails to establish that the operations of the defendants were carried beyond the proper limits of the patent monopoly and licensing thereunder,\" and they did not go \"beyond the activities contemplated by the agreements as written and into the field denounced by the Sherman Act.\"\n\nFinally, the court considered the Government's argument that the defendants acted in concert to blanket the industry under license agreements that would fix and stabilize prices. Assuming that true, the court insisted that the 1926 \"General Electric\" case permitted that conduct: \nGiven a right under the patent law to grant a plurality of bona fide licenses with price control provisions but no objectives beyond the proper limits of a patent monopoly, it can make no difference in either totality of actual restraint, or in law, whether the several licenses are executed with, or without, prearrangement between the patentee and the prospective licensees as a group.\n\nThe court therefore granted the motion to dismiss the case.\n\nJustice Stanley F. Reed delivered the opinion of the Court. Justice Felix Frankfurter filed a concurring opinion because he disagreed with part of the majority opinion.\n\nThe Court stated that the defendants had admitted \"that, in the absence of whatever protection is afforded by valid patents, the licensing arrangements described would be in violation of the Sherman Act.\" This led the Government seek to establish the invalidity of the patents, but \"the trial court held that the government was estopped to attack the validity of the patents in the present proceeding, on the ground that such attack would constitute a review of action by the Commissioner of Patents which was not authorized by statute.\" The Court said that this issue was not necessary to decide, the conduct being illegal irrespective of patent validity, but the Court disagreed with the district court's reasoning. Therefore, \"it seems inadvisable to leave the decision as a precedent.\"\n\nThe Court explained that in antitrust suits brought by a patent licensee against his licensor, 'we have repeatedly held that the licensee may attack the validity of the patent under which he was licensed, because of the public interest in free competition, even though the licensee has agreed in his license not to do so.\" Accordingly, \"in a suit to vindicate the public interest by enjoining violations of the Sherman Act, the United States should have the same opportunity to show that the asserted shield of patentability does not exist.\"\n\nContrary to the district court's ruling at the close of the Government's case, the Court said, \"we think the preponderance of evidence at the conclusion of the government's case indicated a violation of the Sherman Act.\" The evidence proved a conspiracy (a hub-and-spoke conspiracy) and was \"overwhelming evidence of a plan of the licensor and licensees to fix prices and regulate operations in the gypsum board industry\":\n\nWe think that the industry–wide license agreements, entered into with knowledge on the part of licensor and licensees of the adherence of others, with the control over prices and methods of distribution through the agreements and the bulletins, were sufficient to establish a prima facie case of conspiracy. Each licensee, as is shown by the uncontradicted references to the meetings and discussion that were preliminary to the execution of the licenses, could not have failed to be aware of the intention of United States Gypsum and the other licensees to make the arrangements for licenses industry wide. The license agreements themselves, on their face, showed this purpose. The licensor was to fix minimum prices binding both on itself and its licensees; the royalty was to be measured by a percentage of the value of all gypsum products, patented or unpatented.\n\nThe district court also misunderstood the 1926 \"General Electric\" decision. It mistakenly thought that it \"was not required to balance the privileges of United States Gypsum and its licensees under the patent grants with the prohibitions\" of the antitrust laws. But, \"Conspiracies to control prices and distribution, such as we have here, we believe to be beyond any patent privilege.\" The district court erroneously thought that \"only a lack of good faith by defendants in the execution of what that court considered legitimate exploitation of the patents could justify in this case a determination adverse to the defendants.\" The lower court mistakenly held:\n\nAn association of defendants in a common plan to organize the gypsum industry and stabilize prices through a network of patent licenses was legally permissible, and that, in any event, the government failed to prove that the defendants had associated themselves in such a plan. The trial court further found that the license agreements were entered into in good faith, in reliance upon [\"General Electric\";] . . . that the explicit terms in the licenses were within the scope of the patent grant, and that the government had failed to prove any agreement among the defendants to take actions which were outside the scope of the patent grant. Specifically, the trial court found that there was no agreement among the defendants to raise the price of board to arbitrary and noncompetitive levels, to standardize the production of board by pricing . . . seconds out of the market, to eliminate the production of open-edge board, to eliminate jobbers, to control the resale price of board sold to manufacturing distributors, or to stabilize the price of unpatented gypsum products. The court further held that . . . the defendants would have been acting within the scope of the patent grant even if they had agreed to do the things charged.\n\nTo the contrary, the Court explained, \" regardless of motive, the Sherman Act bars patent exploitation of the kind that was here attempted.\" \n\nThe Court emphasized that the \"General Electric\" case does not authorize organization of an industry–wide cartel:\n\nThe Court concluded, \" By the record now presented, violation of the Sherman Act is clear,\" reversed the dismissal, and remanded below for completion of the trial.\n\nJustice Felix Frankfurter filed a concurring opinion in which he disagreed with the majority's explicit rejection of the lower court's ruling that the Government could not challenge patent validity. He argued that the Court should not opine on that in  \"obiter dicta\" since it was unanimous that \"the arrangements challenged by the Government as violative of the Sherman Law cannot find shelter under the patent law, howsoever valid the patents of the defendants may be.\" He insisted, \"Deliberate dicta, I had supposed, should be deliberately avoided.\"\n\nOn the remand ordered by the Court, the District Court entered a summary judgment for the United States, based on the findings in the Supreme Court's opinion. The district court found that the defendants had acted in concert to restrain trade and fix prices in the gypsum board industry in the eastern territory of the United States, and had monopolized that industry, in violation of §§ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. The defendants made an offer of proof of facts they considered relevant. Both parties filled appeals.\n\nJustice Stanley F. Reed filed an opinion for the Court.\n\nThe Court summarily dismissed the defendants' appeal because \"our holding in our first opinion justified a summary judgment for plaintiff on the issue of the violation of the Sherman Act when the record was considered in the light of our opinion and defendants' offer of proof on the remand.\" In the prior opinion in this case, the Court \"said that the intention of United States Gypsum and its licensees to act in concert to attain the purpose of the conspiracy, restraint of trade and monopoly, was apparent from the face of the license agreements,\" and held that the Government's evidence was \"sufficient to establish a \"prima facie\" case of conspiracy.\"\n\nThe Court said it had ruled that \"General Electric\" did not apply because United States Gypsum and its licensees acted in concert with one another to fix prices, but \"there was no holding in our first opinion in \"Gypsum\" that mere multiple licensing violated the Sherman Act.\" The combination of all the competitors in the industry to act in concert to stabilize prices was enough to establish a violation. \"It was not necessary to reach the issue as to whether a mere plurality of licenses, each containing a price-fixing provision, violates the Sherman Act. It is not necessary now.\" The defendants were entitled to proffer evidence but the evidence they proffered \"would not affect our determination, set out above, that price-fixing licenses made in knowing concert by standardized price requirements violated the Sherman Act by their very existence.\" In fact, any \"finding that the manufacturers did not violate the Sherman Act under the evidence introduced by the Government and that proffered by the defendants below would be clearly erroneous in view of the concert of action to fix industry prices by the terms of the licenses.\n\nThe Court then turned to the Government's appeal and its request for additional injunctive relief. The district court limited injunctive relief to the Eastern area and declined to order an injunction against price fix in licenses between United States Gypsum and Pacific Cost licensees. The Supreme Court said that \"the close similarity between interstate commerce violations of the Sherman Act in eastern territory and western territory seems sufficient to justify the enlargement of the geographical scope of the decree to include all interstate commerce.\"\nThe Government asked for an extension of the decree to include all gypsum products, instead of just patented gypsum board alone. The Court said restrictive conduct had involved unpatented gypsum products as well as patented board and agreed with the Government.\n\nThe district court ordered nondiscriminatory compulsory licensing for only 90 days. The Government objected that that was too short a time to dissipate the wrongdoing. It asked for five years of reasonable–royalty and nondiscriminatory licensing, no requirement of reciprocal license grants, and no clauses against challenges to validity. The Court indicated general approval but declined to order a ban on clauses against challenging validity. \"We see no occasion for this unusual provision, and think it should be entirely omitted.\"\n\nJustice Hugo Black wrote separately that he believed that the amendments proposed by the Government on compulsory licensing and validity challenges \"are necessary to protect the public from a continuation of monopolistic practices by United States Gypsum.\"\n\nTwo decades later, the Government indicted United States Gypsum and five other gypsum manufacturers and their officials for price fixing gypsum products. The main thrust of the Government's case was the defendants' so-called inter–seller price verification program in which officials of the competing gypsum manufacturers would contact one another to discuss current prices and credit terms being offered to specific customers. The Government contended that the verification calls were proof of an agreement among the defendants to stabilize prices and police deviations from agreed prices. The defendants claimed that the information exchanges were made only to verify a customer's claim of a competitive offer with more favorable terms and, even then, occurred only in the absence of corroborative information from other sources.\n\nThe defendants proffered two justifications purposes for the information exchanges. First, they argued that prior to granting a price concession to a customer, a seller was required to verify the customer's claim of an allegedly more favorable offer from a competitor to avoid violation of the Robinson-Patman Act's prohibition against price discrimination. They also argued the defendants argued that price verification was necessary to prevent customers' false reports. The district court charged the jury that, if the price information exchanges were found to have been undertaken in good faith to comply with the Robinson-Patman Act, verification alone would not suffice to establish an illegal price-fixing agreement, but that, if the jury found that the effect of verification was to fix prices, then the parties would be presumed, as a matter of law, to have intended that result. The jury convicted the defendants but the Third Circuit reversed the convictions on various grounds, Most important, it held that verification of price concessions with competitors for the sole purpose of taking advantage of the \"meeting competition\" defense of § 2(b) constitutes a \"controlling circumstance\" precluding liability under § 1 of the Sherman Act, and thus a conviction based on an instruction allowing the jury to ignore the defendants' purpose in engaging in the alleged misconduct simply because of the anticompetitive effect could not be sustained. The Third Circuit thought that when a customer asserted to one defendant that another defendant was offering a lower price, the first defendant would have to verify or forego the possible sale, so that verification would lead to price cuts and be procompetitive.\n\nThe Supreme Court, in an opinion by Chief Justice Warren Burger, joined by Justices William J. Brennan, Byron White, and Thurgood Marshall, affirmed the Third Circuit in reversing the district court but declared that intent (\"mens rea\"—guilty, culpable, evil state of mind) is an element of a criminal Sherman Act violation. Justices Potter Stewart and Lewis Powell agreed as to \"mens rea\". Justice John P. Stevens disagreed as to \"mens rea\". Justice William Renquist/ believing the jury instructions adequate, dissented from all of the opinion except for a section on conspiracy. This decision was the first one in which the Court specifically established different standards of proof for civil and criminal antitrust established distinct standards of proof for civil and criminal violations. While affirming the Third Circuit's reversal the Court rejected that Court's statements about good motives for verification being a \"controlling circumstance\" barring antitrust liability.\n\n● Professor Gerald Gibbons explains the \"Gypsum\" case as an illustration of \"sham licensing\"—or \"a screen to shield a mutually advantageous, voluntary renunciation of price competition by the parties.\" He begins by observing that the most significant \"advance in the art revealed\" by the patents involved \"was a folding of the edge of the paper cover on unpatented gypsum board over the exposed core so that the edge of the board was smooth rather than rough.\" The effect of the organization of the industry under the patents was a substantial increase in prices:\nBefore the inauguration of the licensing system, patented board sold at a price premium of fourteen dollars a lot as opposed to twelve dollars for unpatented board. Seven months afterwards the price of folded-edge board soared to twenty dollars a lot and held close to this price throughout the Depression.\n\nHe questions, however, the Court's use of the hub-and-spoke conspiracy doctrine to find the element of concerted action that section 1 of the Sherman Act requires. The test that the Court relied on—\"whether the licensees knew that they would all be offered the same price restrictions\"—is of \"questionable validity\" for patent licensing programs because such licenses are \"normally standardized in all important terms.\" He asserts that prospective licensees object to accepting that discriminate in favor of others licensees, since that would give an advantage to competitors. Therefore, license applicants frequently insist on assurances of standardization and also often request a guarantee that better terms will not be offered to other licensees—a \"most-favored-licensee\" clause—one that provides that any provisions in other licenses that are more favorable to the licensees are automatically available to the licensee demanding the clause. Gibbons says that this reasoning would make most licensing with a restrictive clause the product of conspiracy—\"for restricted licensees will almost always know of similar restrictions offered to others.\" He therefore argues that use of hub-and-spoke conspiracy theory in patent licensing cases \"should be abandoned.\"\n"}

It created the legal definition of wilderness in the United States, and protected 9.1 million acres (37,000 km²) of federal land. The result of a long effort to protect federal wilderness and to create a formal mechanism for designating wilderness, the Wilderness Act was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson on September 3, 1964 after over sixty drafts and eight years of work.\n\nThe Wilderness Act is well known for its succinct and poetic definition of wilderness:\n\n\"A wilderness, in contrast with those areas where man and his own works dominate the landscape, is hereby recognized as an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain.\" - Howard Zahniser\n\nWhen Congress passed and President Lyndon Johnson signed the Wilderness Act on September 3, 1964, it created the National Wilderness Preservation System. The initial statutory wilderness areas, designated in the Act, comprised 9.1 million acres (37,000 km²) of national forest wilderness areas in the United States of America previously protected by administrative orders. The current amount of areas designated by the NWPS as wilderness totals 757 areas encompassing 109.5 million acres of federally owned land in 44 states and Puerto Rico (5% of the land in the United States).\n\nToday, the Wilderness System comprises over 109 million acres (441,000 km²) involving federal lands administered by four agencies:\n\nWilderness Act land is chosen from existing federal land and by determining which areas are considered to have the following criteria:\nAdditionally, areas considered as wilderness should have no enterprises within them or any motorized travel (e.g.; vehicles, motorcycles).\n\nWhen Congress designates each wilderness area, it includes a very specific boundary line in statutory law. Once a wilderness area has been added to the system, its protection and boundary can be altered only by Congress.\n\nThe basics of the program set out in the Wilderness Act are straightforward:\n\n\nWhen the Wilderness Act was passed, it ignored lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management because of uncertainty of policy makers surrounding the future of those areas. The uncertainty was clarified in 1976 with the passing of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, which stated that land managed by the Bureau of Land Management would remain federally owned and, between March 1978 and November 1980, would be reviewed to possibly be classified as wilderness.\n\nSome argue that the criteria to determine wilderness are vague and open to interpretation. For example, one criterion for wilderness is that it be roadless, and the act does not define the term roadless. Wilderness advocacy groups and some agency bureaucrats have attempted to impose this standard: \"the word 'roadless' refers to the absence of roads that have been improved and maintained by mechanical means.\" For more information, see Revised Statute 2477.\n\nAnother criticism of the Wilderness Act is that it defines wilderness as \"where man himself is a visitor who does not remain.\"\n\nCongress considers additional proposals every year, some recommended by federal agencies and many proposed by grassroots conservation and sportsmen's organizations.\n\nCongressional bills are pending to designate new wilderness areas in Utah, Colorado, Washington, California, Virginia, Idaho, West Virginia, Montana and New Hampshire. Grassroots coalitions are working with local congressional delegations on legislative proposals for additional wilderness areas, including Vermont, southern Arizona, national grasslands in South Dakota, Rocky Mountain peaks of Montana, Colorado and Wyoming. The U.S. Forest Service has recommended new wilderness designations, which citizen groups may propose to expand.\n\nIn 2014, America celebrated \"50 Years of Wilderness\", and Wilderness50, a growing coalition of federal agencies, non-profit organizations, academic institutions, and other wilderness user groups has been created to document this historical commemoration honoring America's \"True American Legacy of Wilderness.\"\n\nA series of projects and events were held to commemorate the 50th year of the Wilderness Act, including community museum, airport and visitor center displays; National website and social media campaign; Smithsonian photography exhibition; Washington D.C. Wilderness Week in September, and the National Wilderness Conference.\n\n\n\n"}
