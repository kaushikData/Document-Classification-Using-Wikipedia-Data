The calling for elections for the Constitutional Convention and the main issues to be decided were agreed in 1993 between President Carlos Menem, and former president and leader of the opposition, Raúl Alfonsín.\n\nOn August 22, 1994, after three months of deliberations in the cities of Santa Fe (traditional seat of constitutional conventions) and Paraná, the reform of 43 articles was finally approved in Santa Fe. The deliberations did not end without altercations; for instance, Monsignor Jaime de Nevares resigned his seat, claiming the convention to be \"vitiated with absolute nullity\".\n\nAmongst the most important points of the reform are:\n\nIn order to provide an effective protection to individual rights, the 1994 amendment has introduced actions called: \"amparo\" (injunctions), \"hábeas corpus\", and \"hábeas data\". \"Amparo\" gives the possibility to any person to request that a judge declare the unconstitutionality of an act or ruling on which an action or omission of public authorities or private individuals is based that, in an actual or imminent manner, causes damage or restrains a right recognized by the Constitution, the law, or an international treaty. This action requires that no other effective judicial means be available. \"Hábeas corpus\" is an action that can be filled to protect the right of physical freedom when it is threatened, limited, modified, or injured, or in case of illegitimate aggravation of conditions of detention. \"Hábeas data\" is an action that can be filled by any individual to take notice of any information referred to him, registered in public or private registers, and to request its suppression, rectification, confidentiality, or updating.\n\nAnother innovation introduced by the 1994 amendment is the right of citizens to introduce bills before the House of Deputies that must be considered by Congress within the next twelve months. A further innovative provision is the recognition of the right of every inhabitant to a healthy environment in article 41 that establishes that\n\nAdditionally, there are precise provisions referring to protection of consumers rights, defense of competition, control of natural or legal monopolies, and of public services' quality and efficiency.\n"}

Administrative Scrivener are found in a variety of roles. Many specialize in immigration matters, wills, inheritances, motor vehicle registrations, Development approvals, articles of incorporation, company minutes, etc. Under the Administrative Scrivener Law, the types of documents that such professionals are authorised to prepare extends into the thousands, involving the aforementioned as well as attachments to administrative applications and contractual documents between corporate and private persons. The exception is when certain laws expressly designate a person in another capacity to prepare a legal document. \n\nAdministrative Scriveners may also give advice on the preparation of such documents, one of the few exceptions to the attorney at law's monopoly on giving \"legal advice\" for compensation.\n\nThe work of an Administrative Scriveners bears certain overlaps with that of Attorney at Law or Scrivener in American or Common Law jurisdictions. Beside barristers, prosecutors, justices and judicial scriveners, they form an important part of the legal landscape in Japan.\n\nSouth Korea has a similar occupation known as Haeng-jeong-sa (Hangul: 행정사, Hanja: 行政士).\n\nThe 1997 amendment to the Administrative Scrivener Law has clarified the purpose of the qualification and monopoly.\n\n1. This law determines the system of Administrative Scriveners. Such will allow greater precision in the work, (the scrivener) facilitates the smooth execution of administrative procedures. In all, the aim is to provide convenience to the citizenry.\n\nAttorneys at law, certified public accountants, patent attorneys and tax attorneys are automatically qualified to register as administrative scriveners. Any person who has worked in an \"administrative position\" at a government agency for 20 years is also entitled to the qualification. Otherwise, one must take the national examinations held every year as mentioned below.\n\nThe registration of Administrative Scriveners can be revoked lawfully if the person belongs to the following.\n\nAdministrative Scrivener must maintain a membership in the Administrative Scrivener Association ( 行政書士会, gyōsei shoshi kai ) for the prefecture in which they work. The membership will cost approximately 300,000 yen. Member are also expected thereafter to pay 60,000 yen annually. There exists slight differences in the various prefectures and administrative districts pertaining to the cost.\n\nIf it is not done, one will not be allowed to perform work naturally, besides not being allowed to present him or herself as an administrative Scrivener. Nonetheless, in actuality, there is an increasing trend of members not paying their dues. As disciplinary action, after a request from the prefectural leaders, names of scriveners who do not pay will be released on the website of the Japan Federation of Gyoseishoshi Lawyers, with effect from 20 April 2011. The problem has begun to surface as such. As of March 2009, there are 39,846 registrants with 156 corporate bodies.\n\nThe administrative Scrivener must record his name and impress his professional seal on documents that he prepares (under Execution Procedures of the Administrative Scrivener Law, section 9, subsection 2).\n\nAll in general are qualified to take the exam. The exam is customarily held throughout the nation on the second Sunday of each November. The prefectural authority designates the civil body, The Corporate Person of the Administrative Scrivener Examinations and Research Centre as its sole executor.\n\nSubjects tested include laws relating to the work of a scrivener such as Constitutional Law, Civil Law, Administrative Law, Companies Law and basic legal knowledge. The aptitude of a person to do such work, such as general knowledge in politics, economics and society, knowledge pertaining to the safe transmission of Information, protection of personal information and comprehension of written passages. The syllabi of each exam is based on the current law as of the first of April every year. To pass, one must gain more than 60% of the total score, 50% in legal subjects and 40% in general knowledge subjects.

This would incentivise assassination of individuals because the assassin, knowing when the action would take place, could profit by making an accurate bet on the time of the subject's death. Because the payoff is for accurately picking the date rather than performing the action of the assassin, it is substantially more difficult to assign criminal liability for the assassination.\n\nEarly uses of the terms \"assassination market\" and \"market for assassinations\" can be found (in both positive and negative lights) in 1994's \"The Cyphernomicon\" by Timothy C. May, a cypherpunk. The concept and its potential effects are also referred to as assassination politics, a term popularized by Jim Bell in his 1995-96 essay of the same name.\n\nEarly in part 1, Jim Bell describes the idea as:\n\nBell then goes on to further specify the protocol of the assassination market in more detail. In the final part of his essay, Bell posits a market that is largely non-anonymous. He contrasts this version with the one previously described. Carl Johnson's attempt to popularise the concept of assassination politics appeared to rely on the earlier version. There followed an attempt to popularise the second in 2001 that is ongoing today.\n\nTechnologies like Tor and Bitcoin have enabled online assassination markets as described in parts one to nine of \"Assassination Politics\".\n\nThe first prediction market entitled 'Assassination Market' was created by a self-described crypto-anarchist in 2013.

{"id": "9251497", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9251497", "title": "Bootleggers and Baptists", "text": "Bootleggers and Baptists\n\nBootleggers and Baptists is a concept put forth by regulatory economist Bruce Yandle, derived from the observation that regulations are supported both by groups that want the ostensible purpose of the regulation, and by groups that profit from undermining that purpose.\n\nFor much of the 20th century, Baptists and other evangelical Christians were prominent in political activism for Sunday closing laws restricting the sale of alcohol. Bootleggers sold alcohol illegally, and got more business if legal sales were restricted. \"Such a coalition makes it easier for politicians to favor both groups. ... [T]he Baptists lower the costs of favor-seeking for the bootleggers, because politicians can pose as being motivated purely by the public interest even while they promote the interests of well-funded businesses. ... [Baptists] take the moral high ground, while the bootleggers persuade the politicians quietly, behind closed doors.\"\n\nThe mainstream economic theory of regulation treats politicians and administrators as brokers among interest groups. Bootleggers and Baptists is a specific idea in the subfield of regulatory economics that attempts to predict which interest groups will succeed in obtaining rules they favor. It holds that coalitions of opposing interests that can agree on a common rule will be more successful than one-sided groups.\n\nBaptists do not merely agitate for legislation, they help monitor and enforce it (a law against Sunday alcohol sales without significant public support would likely be ignored, or be evaded through bribery of enforcement officers). Thus bootleggers and Baptists is not just an academic restatement of the common political accusation that shadowy for-profit interests are hiding behind public-interest groups to fund deceptive legislation. It is a rational theory to explain relative success among types of coalitions.\n\nAnother part of the theory is that bootleggers and Baptists produce suboptimal legislation. Although both groups are satisfied with the outcome, broader society would be better off either with no legislation or different legislation. For example, a surtax on Sunday alcohol sales could reduce Sunday alcohol consumption as much as making it illegal. Instead of enriching bootleggers and imposing policing costs, the surtax could raise money to be spent on, say, property tax exemptions for churches and alcoholism treatment programs. Moreover, such a program could be balanced to reflect the religious beliefs and drinking habits of everyone, not just certain groups. From the religious point of the view, the bootleggers have not been cut out of the deal, the government has become the bootlegger.\n\nAlthough the bootleggers and Baptists story has become a standard idea in regulatory economics, it has not been systematically validated as an empirical proposition. It is a catch-phrase useful in analyzing regulatory coalitions rather than an accepted principle of economics.\n\nLegislation and treaties to reduce global warming often command support of both polluters and environmentalists. While there are several possible interpretations of that (for example, polluters could be trying to forestall stronger legislation, or to involve themselves in the process to insert specific protections; environmentalists could be unaware of industry support or fooled by it) it has been held up as an example of bootleggers and Baptists. In this version of the story, the polluters are looking for taxes and regulations to reduce competition, hoping to gain more from ability to charge higher prices than it costs them to pay taxes and comply with regulations. Environmentalists don’t care that some users of carbon are paying more money to some carbon emitters, as long as total carbon emissions go down and society takes a public stance in favor of the environment.\n\n\"Arkansas liquor stores have allied with religious leaders to fight statewide legalization of alcohol sales. The stores in wet counties don’t want to lose customers. The churches don’t want to lose souls. Larry Page, a Southern Baptist pastor and director of the Arkansas Faith and Ethics Council, which traces its roots to the Anti-Saloon League of Arkansas in 1899, [also recalled]...when his group joined with feminists to oppose pornography and cooperated with Mississippi casinos to fight gambling in Arkansas.\"\n\nBootleggers and Baptists has been invoked to explain nearly every political alliance for regulation in the United States in the last 30 years including the Clean Air Act, interstate trucking, state liquor stores, the Pure Food and Drug Act, environmental policy, regulation of genetically modified organisms, the North American Free Trade Agreement, environmental politics, gambling legislation, blood donation, wine regulation, and the tobacco settlement.\n\n"}

The domain name is an abbreviation for \"George W. Bush, 43rd\" President of the United States. The use of this email domain became public when it was discovered that J. Scott Jennings, the White House's deputy director of political affairs, was using a gwb43.com email address to discuss the firing of the U.S. attorney for Arkansas. Communications by federal employees were also found on georgewbush.com (registered to \"Bush-Cheney '04, Inc.\") and rnchq.org (registered to \"Republican National Committee\"). Congressional requests for administration documents while investigating the dismissals of the U.S. attorneys required the Bush administration to reveal that not all internal White House emails were available. Conducting governmental business in this manner is a possible violation of the Presidential Records Act of 1978. Over 5 million emails may have been lost. Greg Palast claims to have come up with 500 of the Karl Rove emails, leading to damaging allegations. In 2009, it was announced that as many as 22 million emails may have been lost.\n\nThe \"gwb43.com\" domain name was publicized by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), who sent a letter to Oversight and Government Reform Committee chairman Henry A. Waxman requesting an investigation. Waxman sent a formal warning to the RNC, advising them to retain copies of all emails sent by White House employees. According to Waxman, \"in some instances, White House officials were using nongovernmental accounts specifically to avoid creating a record of the communications.\" The Republican National Committee claims to have erased the emails, supposedly making them unavailable for Congressional investigators.\n\nOn April 12, 2007, White House spokesman Scott Stanzel stated that White House staffers were told to use RNC accounts to \"err on the side of avoiding violations of the Hatch Act, but they should also retain that information so it can be reviewed for the Presidential Records Act,\" and that \"some employees ... have communicated about official business on those political email accounts.\" Stanzel also said that even though RNC policy since 2004 has been to retain all emails of White House staff with RNC accounts, the staffers had the ability to delete the email, themselves.\n\nOn December 14, 2009, CNN reported that all 22 million missing emails had been found on backup tapes, and that the Obama Administration reached a settlement with two watchdog groups who had sued to obtain the emails.\n\nAccording to a former White House official, Karl Rove used RNC-hosted addresses for roughly \"95 percent\" of his email. Rove provided email from his kr@georgewbush.com address in exhibits to the United States House Committee on the Judiciary.\n\nWhite House deputy Jennifer Farley told Jack Abramoff not to use the official White House system \"because it might actually limit what they can do to help us, especially since there could be lawsuits, etc.\" Abramoff responded, \"Dammit. It was sent to Susan on her RNC pager and was not supposed to go into the WH system.\"\n\nThe House Oversight committee in an interim staff report, released on June 18, 2007:\n\nDuring the investigation into the firing of eight U.S. attorneys, it became known White House staff was using Republican National Committee (RNC) email accounts. The White House stated it might have lost five million emails.\n\nOn May 2, 2007, the Senate Judiciary Committee issued a subpoena to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and the Department of Justice (DOJ) compelling the production of email Karl Rove sent to DOJ staff, regarding evaluation and dismissal of attorneys, no matter what email account Rove used, whether White House or National Republican party accounts, or other accounts, with a deadline of May 15, 2007 for compliance. The subpoena also demanded relevant email previously produced in the Valerie Plame controversy and investigation for the CIA leak scandal (2003).\n\nAmbassador Joseph C. Wilson alleged that his wife's identity was covert and that members of the George W. Bush administration knowingly revealed that information as retribution for his New York Times op-ed entitled \"What I Didn't Find in Africa,\" of July 6, 2003, regarding the claim that Saddam Hussein was seeking uranium. Patrick J. Fitzgerald, while investigating the leak, found that emails were missing from the White House server. Mother Jones wrote that this is possibly the reason the RNC changed the policy of deleting emails after 30 days to saving all email sent and received by White House officials. In light of the apparent vanished emails Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) has asked to reopen the investigation.\n\nIt is feared that the missing emails might also affect congressional investigation of General Services Administration.\n\nWhile investigating the Reading First program CREW learned that employees use private emails to conduct official business. This might be a violation of the Federal Records Act.\n\nThe Hatch Act prohibits the use of government resources, including email accounts, for political purposes. The Bush administration stated the RNC accounts were used to prevent violation of this Act.\n\nThe Presidential Records Act mandates the preservation of all presidential records. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and \"The Wall Street Journal\" contend that the missing emails may constitute a violation of this Act.\n\n"}

{"id": "6598147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6598147", "title": "Concentration risk", "text": "Concentration risk\n\nConcentration risk is a banking term describing the level of risk in a bank's portfolio arising from concentration to a single counterparty, sector or country. \n\nThe risk arises from the observation that more concentrated portfolios are less diverse and therefore the returns on the underlying assets are more correlated. \n\nConcentration risk can be calculated for a single bank loan or whole portfolio using a \"concentration ratio\". For a single loan, the concentration ratio is simply the proportion of the portfolio the loan represents (e.g. a $100 loan in a $1000 portfolio would have a ratio of 0.1 or 10%) \n\nFor a whole portfolio, a herfindahl index is used to calculate the degree of concentration to a single name, sector of the economy or country. Separate concentratio ratios must be calculated for each type of concentration. \n\nTo illustrate, a portfolio with 10 equally sized loans would have a concentration ratio of 0.1 or 10%, whereas a portfolio of 10 loans - 9 equally sized and 1 equal to half the value of the portfolio would have a concentration ratio of 0.27 or 27%.\n\nThe ratio is useful for bankers or investors at large to identify when a portfolio may be excessively exposed to the risk that a recession or downturn in one sector of the economy or another country may cause a high proportion of the bank's outstanding loans to default. \n\nConcentration risk is usually monitored by risk functions, committees and boards within commercial banks and is normally only allowed to operate within proscribed limits. It is also monitored by banking regulators and generally attracts a higher capital charge in banking regulation. \n\nThere are two types of concentration risk. These types are based on the sources of the risk. Concentration risk can arise from uneven distribution of exposures (or loan) to its borrowers. Such a risk is called \"name concentration risk\". Another type is \"sectoral concentration risk\", which can arise from uneven distribution of exposures to particular sectors, regions, industries or products.\n\nMost financial institutions have policies to identify and limit concentration risk. This typically involves setting certain thresholds for various types of risk. Once these thresholds are set, they are managed by frequent and diligent reporting to assess concentration areas and identify elevated thresholds.\n\nA key component to the management of concentration risk is accurately defining thresholds across various concentrations to minimize the combined risks across concentrations.\n"}

The Confederacy also operated under a Provisional Constitution from February 8, 1861, to February 22, 1862. The original Provisional Constitution is currently located at the American Civil War Museum in Richmond, Virginia, and differs slightly from the version later adopted. The final, hand-written document is currently located in the University of Georgia archives at Athens, Georgia. In regard to most articles of the Constitution, the document is a word-for-word duplicate of the United States Constitution. However, there are crucial differences between the two documents, in tone and legal content, primarily regarding slavery.\n\n\nThe Confederate Constitution followed the U.S. Constitution for the most part in the main body of the text with some changes.\n\nArticle I Differences:\n\n\nArticle I Section 8(3) adds quite a bit to the U.S. Constitution in an attempt to block the Confederate Congress from passing law to \"facilitate commerce\" with some exceptions allowing for safety and improvement to waterways.\n\n\n\n\nThen in Section 10:\n\nChanges to Article II:\nChanges to Article III\nChanges to Article IV\n\n\"Other states may be admitted into this Confederacy by a vote of two-thirds of the whole House of Representatives, and two-thirds of the Senate, the Senate voting by states; but no new state shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other state; nor any state be formed by the junction of two or more states, or parts of states, without the consent of the legislatures of the states concerned as well as of the Congress.\"\n\nChanges to Article V\nChanges to Article VI\n\nArticle VI Section 1(1)\nChanges to Article VII\n\"When five states shall have ratified this Constitution, in the manner before specified, the Congress under the Provisional Constitution, shall prescribe the time for holding the election of President and Vice President; and, for the meeting of the Electoral College; and, for counting the votes, and inaugurating the President.

Unsurprisingly, given that the Confederate Constitution was based on the United States Constitution, the Confederate State Supreme Courts often used United States Supreme Court precedents. The jurisprudence of the Marshall Court, thus, influenced the interpretation of the Confederate Constitution. The state courts repeatedly upheld robust powers of the Confederate Congress, especially on matters of military necessity.\n\nAccording to an 1861 speech delivered by Alabamian politician Robert Hardy Smith, the State of Alabama declared its secession from the U.S. in order to preserve and perpetuate the practice of slavery, the debate over which he referred to as the \"Negro quarrel\". In the speech, Smith praised the Confederate constitution for its un-euphemistic and succinct protections of the right to own \"Negro\" slaves:\n\nGeorgia Democrat Alexander H. Stephens, who would become the Confederacy's vice president, also stated that the Confederate constitution was \"decidedly better than\" the American one, as it \"put at rest, forever, all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institution. African slavery as it exists amongst us; the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution.

The case had been marked by judicial misconduct, and had reached an impasse.\n\nThe 2013 signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with Iran to facilitate the investigation led to a breach between Nisman and President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. Nisman alleged that the signing of the memorandum with Iran was part of an effort to cover-up alleged Iranian complicity in the AMIA bombing in exchange for improved trade relations. The accusation was based on Nisman's belief that the administration had petitioned Interpol to lift Red Notices against numerous Iranian officials during the negotiations. The Secretary General of Interpol at the time, Ronald Noble, said on 15 January 2015 that no such requests had been made, and that Foreign Minister Héctor Timerman had stated on each occasion the case was discussed that Interpol should keep the red notices effective, and that \"Prosecutor Nisman's assertion is false.\"\n\nNisman's body was found 19 January. The discovery of the body came hours before the prosecutor was to present his complaint to the Criminal Law Committee of the Chamber of Deputies; Nisman had already submitted his complaint and wiretap transcripts to Judge Ariel Lijo on 14 January. The Nisman death is under investigation by Federal Judge Emma Palmaghini and Special Prosecutor Viviana Fein. It is unknown if the death was a suicide, a forced suicide, or a murder.\n\nFederal Judge Daniel Rafecas dismissed the Nisman complaint, which had been resubmitted to the courts by Federal Prosecutor Gerardo Pollicita, on 26 February. Judge Rafecas held in his ruling that \"none of the two hypotheses of a crime put forward by prosecutor Pollicita in his writ stand up to the minimum level of scrutiny\".\n\nPollicita did not succeed Nisman as chief AMIA prosecutor; this office was headed as of 13 February by a prosecution task force led by coordinator Juan Murray.\n\nIn a complaint issued on Tuesday January 13, 2015, Nisman accused President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, Minister of Foreign Relations Héctor Timerman, deputy Andrés Larroque and the \"piqueteros\" Luis D'Elia and Fernando Esteche of concealment. According to Nisman, they had guaranteed impunity of Iran with the memorandum to unblock relations with this country and impute some called \"local fascists\".\n\nThe complaint was based on eavesdropping on an alleged Iranian spy who spoke on different occasions to D'Elia, Esteche, and Larroque, and on Nisman's stated belief that the administration had petitioned Interpol to lift Red Notices against numerous Iranian officials during said negotiations. The Secretary General of Interpol at the time, Ronald Noble, noted on 15 January 2015 however that no such requests had been made, and that “on each occasion that [Foreign Minister Héctor Timerman] and I spoke about the Interpol red notices issued in connection to the AMIA case, [Timerman] stated that Interpol should keep the red notices effective.” Noble added on 18 January that \"Prosecutor Nisman's assertion is false.\"\n\nNisman claimed that Cristina Fernandez had ordered an agent of the \"SIDE\" (Secretariat of Intelligence) she trusts or Andrés Larroque, and both delivered that to Esteche or to D'Elia. D'Elia communicated to the alleged Iranian agent Alejandro Yussuf Khalil, who telephoned Mohsen Rabbani (one of the parties accused of the 1994 bombing). According to Nisman, the reasons for the orders were intended to overcome \"the Argentina energy crisis through an exchange of [Iranian] oil with [Argentine] grains\" and \"even sell arms [to Iran]\". Nisman claimed that to finalize the memorandum, the condition that Interpol red notices against several officials of Iran be rescinded was included, an assertion discredited by Interpol director Ronald Noble. Wikileaks cables also revealed that the U.S. Embassy in Argentina had given Nisman direct orders not to investigate any local connections to the AMIA bombing as well as any Syrian links to same. He was instead to assume guilt on the part of the Iranian suspects in the case regardless of evidence.\n\nNisman was found next to a Bersa gun, .22 caliber, in his 13th-floor apartment in the Torre del Parque building within the upscale Le Parc Puerto Madero development located in Puerto Madero, Buenos Aires. At 3 a.m. on Monday, 19 January 2015, after Nisman's mother tried, with no success, to open the door, a locksmith could open the service door of his house, which was locked from inside. When they managed to get inside, Nisman's body was found lifeless in the bathroom, along with a pistol and a cap bullet.\n\nAccording to the autopsy, Nisman died the previous afternoon and had an entry bullet wound on the right parietal (temple) of his head, two inches above the ear; the bullet remained inside the head with no exit wound. His body was found inside the bathroom and blocking the door, and there were no signs of forced entry or robbery in the apartment. The paraffin test did not reveal any gunshot residue on Nisman's hands, suggesting that he may not have fired the gun himself. The results of such a test, however, may not be conclusive, as the gun involved is of small caliber and may leave no trace. His body did not have signs of physical attack, and Prosecutor Fein commented that there were no items suggesting the presence of other people at the crime scene. Fein announced on 9 February, however, that DNA from a second person was found on a coffee cup in the kitchen sink. Nisman had made numerous cryptic comments shortly before his death, including a WhatsApp message that said \"I'm better than ever and sooner than later the truth will prevail\".\n\nThe gun found did not belong to Nisman. It was registered in the name of an employee of the prosecutor, computer repair technician Diego Lagomarsino. Lagomarsino was a frequent guest at the Nisman residence, and is the last person known to have seen him alive. He last visited Nisman at around 8 p.m. on the day of Nisman's death, and according to Le Parc security records, stayed there as late as 12:54 a.m.\n\nWhile the .22 caliber weapon that fired the fatal shot belonged to Lagomarsino, he could not explain how no fingerprints of his were present on the weapon, as would be expected. He claimed to have brought it to the apartment upon request, because Nisman distrusted his own custody. Accordingly, Nisman's 10-man security detail were not at home watching when Nisman died. Lagomarsino earned an unusually large salary as Nisman's personal computer technician (40,000 pesos a month during 2014; US$5,000 at the time). He was asked in a 5 February press conference if he had a homosexual relationship with Nisman as well as a professional one, which he denied. Senator Salvador Cabral stated on 25 February that he had proof to that effect, and was subpoenaed by prosecutor Fein to provide an affidavit.\n\nSenior Secretariat of Intelligence officer Antonio \"Jaime\" Stiusso, who conducted many of the wiretaps ordered by Nisman, had been dismissed in a December 2014 agency shakeup and had persuaded Nisman to dismiss his 10-man security detail days before his death. Stiusso presented himself on 18 February for questioning by Special Prosecutor Fein after initially evading the subpoenas. Facing unrelated charges of smuggling, he reportedly fled the country for neighboring Uruguay a week later in a black pickup registered to one of the companies allegedly involved in the smuggling operation.\n\nNisman's death caused an international stir and appeared in many news media worldwide.\n\nThe prosecutor in the case said: \"There are no witnesses, and no neighbors who could provide data on what happened\". It remains unknown if the death was a suicide, a forced suicide, or a murder. Following his death there were massive protests across the country demanding justice and uncovering the cause of death.\n\nThe official report released in 2017, concluded that Nisman was murdered which contradicts previous government claims that he committed suicide. It states he was assaulted by two people, beaten and shot.\n\nOn the 18 February 2015, there was a silent demonstration, convened by the Attorney congregation and federal attorney, in various cities in Argentina and abroad, in order to commemorate the death of Nisman a month earlier. An estimated 400,000 marched in silence in Buenos Aires in torrential rains to honour and mark his death.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1857260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1857260", "title": "Devocalization", "text": "Devocalization\n\nDevocalization (also known as ventriculocordectomy or vocal cordectomy and when performed on dogs is commonly known as debarking or bark softening) is a surgical procedure performed on dogs and cats, where tissue is removed from the animal's vocal cords to permanently reduce the volume of its vocalizations.\n\nDevocalization is usually performed at the request of an animal owner (where the procedure is legally permitted). The procedure may be forcefully requested as a result of a court order. Owners or breeders generally request the procedure because of excessive animal vocalizations, complaining neighbors, or as an alternative to euthanasia due to a court order.\n\nContraindications include negative reaction to anesthesia, infection, bleeding, and pain. There is also the possibility of the removed tissue growing back, or of scar tissue blocking the throat, both requiring further surgeries, though with the incisional technique, the risk of fibrosis is virtually eliminated.\n\nThe devocalization procedure does not take away a dog's ability to bark. Dogs will normally bark just as much as before the procedure. After the procedure the sound will be softer, typically about half as loud as before, or less, and it is not as sharp or piercing. So while the procedure does not stop barking or silence the animal completely, it is effective in reducing the sound level and sharpness of the dog's bark.\n\nMost devocalized dogs have a subdued \"husky\" bark, audible up to 20 metres.\n\nThe procedure may be performed via the animal's mouth, with a portion of the vocal folds removed using a biopsy punch, cautery tool, scissor, or laser. The procedure may also be performed via an incision in the throat and through the larynx, which is a more invasive technique. All devocalization procedures require general anesthesia.\n\nChronic, excessive vocalization may be due to improper socialization or training, stress, boredom, fear, or frustration. Up to 35% of dog owners report problems with barking, which can cause disputes and legal problems. The behavior is more common among some breeds of dog, such as the Shetland Sheepdog, which are known as loud barkers, due to the nature of the environment in which the breed was developed.\n\nVocalizations are a natural behavior of animals which they use widely in intra-specific and inter-specific communication. As such, devocalization should generally be considered only as a last resort. Prior to this surgical intervention, there are other, less invasive interventions which can be considered to overcome excessive vocalizations.\n\nTraining can be one of the most effective techniques to help combat excessive barking in dogs. Acquiring the help of a professional dog trainer can often help reduce an animal's barking.\n\nThe use of automatic and manual corrective collars can be useful as a training aid when used correctly; however, the use of corrective collars, particularly shock collars, is controversial and banned in some countries. Types of corrective collars include vibration, citronella spray, ultrasonic and electrostatic/shock collar.\n\nBecause dogs often bark excessively due to stress, boredom, or frustration, changing aspects of an animal's environment to make them more content is a suitable way to quiet them down, rather than forcibly silencing a distressed animal. Spending more time with an animal, such as playing, walking, and other bonding activities, will keep them occupied and make them feel more at ease. If the animal is stressed, it is best to remove the object that is causing them discomfort.\n\n\n\nDr. Kathy Gaughan points out that \"the surgery stops the barking, but it doesn't address why the dog was barking in the first place.\" Gaughan notes that visitors to her clinic who request debarking are usually looking for a \"quick fix\". Gaughan states that, commonly, those who seek debarking live in apartments, or have neighbors who complain. Gaughan also counts \"breeders with many dogs\" among those who most often seek convenience devocalization. However, Dr. Gaughan does not agree with those who claim the procedure is cruel, stating: \"Recently, some animal advocates have asserted this surgery is cruel to the animal; some countries have even outlawed the procedure. I do not believe the surgical procedure is cruel; however, failing to address the underlying factors is inappropriate.\"\n\nSome breeders seek the surgery in order to limit or diminish noise levels for personal reasons ranging from convenience to prevention; some breeders even seek the surgery for puppies prior to going to new homes.\n\nMultiple animal medicine and animal welfare organizations discourage the use of convenience devocalization, recommending that it only be used as a last resort. However, organizations such as the American Veterinary Medical Association, American Animal Hospital Association and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, oppose laws that would make devocalization illegal.\n\nThe American Veterinary Medical Association's official position states that \"canine devocalization should only be performed by qualified, licensed veterinarians as a final alternative after behavioral modification efforts to correct excessive vocalization have failed.\" \n\nThe AVMA's position was later adopted by the American Animal Hospital Association.\n\nThe Canadian Veterinary Medical Association's position statement on devocalization of dogs states: “The Canadian Veterinary Medical Association (CVMA) discourages “devocalization” of dogs unless it is the only alternative to euthanasia, and humane treatment and management methods have failed.\"\n\nThe American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) recommends that animal caretakers first attempt to address animal behavior problems with humane behavior modification techniques and/or with a treatment protocol set up by an animal behavior specialist. The ASPCA recommends surgery only if behavior modification techniques have failed, and the animal is at risk of losing its home or its life.\n\nThe legality of convenience devocalization varies by jurisdiction.\n\nThe procedure is outlawed as a form of mutilation in the United Kingdom and all countries that have signed the European Convention for the Protection of Pet Animals. In the United States, devocalization is illegal in Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Warwick, Rhode Island.\n\nDebarking is specifically prohibited in the UK, along with ear cropping, tail docking, and declawing of cats. By law, convenience devocalization is considered a form of surgical mutilation.\n\nIn the United States, laws vary by state. In 2000, anti-debarking legislation was proposed in California, New Jersey, and Ohio. The California and New Jersey bills failed, partially due to opposition from groups who predicted the ban would lead to similar bans on ear cropping and other controversial cosmetic surgical procedures on dogs. The Ohio bill survived, and was signed into law by Governor Robert Taft in August 2000. However, Ohio Revised Code 955.22 only outlawed debarking of dogs considered \"vicious\".\n\nIn February 2009, 15-year-old Jordan Star of Needham, Massachusetts, filed a bill to outlaw performing convenience devocalization procedures upon cats and dogs. The bill was co-sponsored by Senator Scott Brown, with the title \"Logan's Law\", after a debarked sheepdog. Star said of convenience devocalization: \"To take a voice away from an animal is morally wrong.\" The bill became state law on April 23, 2010.\n\nDevocalizing cats and dogs became illegal in Massachusetts by state law in 2010 and in Warwick, Rhode Island, by city ordinance in 2011. Legislation to ban devocalization of dogs and cats in New York State is underway.\n\n\n"}

The applicant would have been dressed in full armour, shield and spear in his left hand, his right hand raised and touching the right hand of the moderator. The oath was quoted by the Attic orator Lycurgus, in his work \"Against Leocrates\" (4th century BCE), though it is certainly archaic (5th century BCE). The \"Ephebate\", an organization for training the young men of Athens, chiefly in military matters, had existed since the 5th century but was reorganized by Lycurgus. The oath was taken in the temple of Aglaurus, daughter of Cecrops, probably at the age of eighteen when the youth underwent an examination (Greek: δοκιμασία) and had his name entered on the deme register. He was then an ephebus until the age of twenty.\n\nThe ephebic oath is preserved on an inscription from Acharnae, which was written in the mid-fourth century BC. Other versions of the oath are preserved in the works of Stobaeus and Pollux.\n\nΟὐκ αἰσχυνῶ τὰ ἱερὰ ὅπλα, οὐδὲ λείψω τὸν παραστάτην ὅπου ἂν στοιχήσω: ἀμυνῶ δὲ καὶ ὑπὲρ ἱερῶν καὶ ὁσίων καὶ οὐκ ἐλάττω παραδώσω τὴν πατρίδα, πλείω δὲ καὶ ἀρείω κατά τε ἐμαυτὸν καὶ μετὰ ἁπάντων, καὶ εὐηκοήσω τῶν ἀεὶ κραινόντων ἐμφρόνως. καὶ τῶν θεσμῶν τῶν ἱδρυμένων καὶ οὓς ἂν τὸ λοιπὸν ἱδρύσωνται ἐμφρόνως: ἐὰν δέ τις ἀναιρεῖ, οὐκ ἐπιτρέψω κατά τε ἐμαυτὸν καὶ μετὰ πάντων, καὶ τιμήσω ἱερὰ τὰ πάτρια. ἴστορες θεοὶ Ἄγραυλος, Ἑστία, Ἐνυώ, Ἐνυάλιος, Ἄρης καὶ Ἀθηνᾶ Ἀρεία, Ζεύς, Θαλλώ, Αὐξώ, Ἡγεμόνη, Ἡρακλῆς, ὅροι τῆς πατρίδος, πυροί, κριθαί, ἄμπελοι, ἐλάαι, συκαῖ...\n\nI will not bring dishonour on my sacred arms nor will I abandon my comrade wherever I shall be stationed.

{"id": "43597196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43597196", "title": "Foreign legal opinion", "text": "Foreign legal opinion\n\nA foreign legal opinion (or foreign law opinion) is an opinion of a law firm issued in cross-border commercial transactions certifying the effectiveness of the transaction under the applicable foreign law. Foreign legal opinions have become highly standardised over time, and most foreign legal opinions follow a fairly regimented format. The issuance of such opinions has become something of a sub-legal specialisation in itself, and books and articles are written on the subject of foreign legal opinions. A number of organisations issue template format opinions to indicate issues which are intended to be covered by such opinions, or standard form checklists for contents.\n\nThe original purpose of foreign legal opinion is grounded in the historical doctrine of \"ultra vires\". The concern was that when doing business with a corporation formed in a foreign country, proper due diligence required that a legal opinion be sought to ensure that the relevant foreign company had the necessary capacity and power to enter into the transaction, and that it would be binding upon it. Over time opinions expanded to cover related aspects of foreign law, such as whether payments might be subject to exchange controls or usury laws, whether it was necessary for any of the other parties to hold any licences or permits under the regulatory laws of the foreign country, whether there would be adverse tax consequences under the laws of the foreign country, whether foreign judgments were recognised and enforced in that country other collateral matters.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s with the expansions in cross-border lender by financial institutions, banks became increasingly concerned to ensure that foreign companies to whom they lent money provided a foreign legal opinion certifying the legal validity of the loan transaction and the enforceability of the banks' rights (including any security interests). In time these requires came to be reflected in the Basel capital adequacy requirements for banks, resulting in different, more favourable, capital weighting for loans supported by opinions.\n\nForeign legal opinions are now highly standardised. Typically such opinions will confirm the jurisdiction which they relate to, confirm the documents that they reviewed, list certain assumptions of fact, and then set out various opinion statements. After the opinion statements, they will typically make certain standard, generally applicable qualifications.\n\nThe opinion will ordinarily state the conclusions of law, but will not provide reasoning. This reflects the role of the foreign law opinion as a risk assessment tool. The opinion is normally issued in the format of an unqualified favourable statement of the effectiveness of the transaction (hedged in by appropriate assumptions of fact and general qualifications of law). Where there are areas of legal uncertainty, or issues which require clarification and analysis, the foreign legal opinion will often remain in the standardised format, but will be supplemented with a second, reasoned, opinion. In cross border transactions the negotiation and discussion of the format of the foreign law opinions elucidates areas of legal stress or risk in relation to the proposed transaction and foreign legal systems.\n\nStandard assumptions normally include assuming that documents and records reviewed by the law firm giving the opinion are accurate, that all copies they review are true copies, and that no provision of any other law (i.e. the laws of any country other than the country on whose laws the opinion is being given) adversely affects the opinion being expressed. In certain countries it is also standard to assume the genuineness of signatures and seals, but in other countries the foreign law firm may be expected to verify the accuracy of such signatures.\n\nThe substantive opinion statements a foreign legal opinion will make will ordinarily include:\n\nStandard qualifications are usually matters of general law which it is impractical to advise upon in the abstract, but which might undermine the effectiveness of the enforceability of the transaction. For example most opinions will indicate that if the foreign party goes into bankruptcy that will limit the ability to enforce obligations against it. Similarly, rights may be lost when statutory limitation periods expire. In certain countries enforcement of obligations may be subject to obligations of good faith and fair dealing, and the foreign legal opinion will normally point this out by way of qualification.\n\nThe foreign legal opinion will typically express opinions on various issues which might not ordinarily be governed by the laws of the foreign country under its own conflict of laws system. Because a cross border transaction might end up being considered by the courts of any of a number of countries, the addressee(s) of the opinion will wish to be assured that all relevant issues, if determined by that foreign law, would likely be resolved satisfactorily. The courts of a third country may apply different choice of law rules to determine the \"lex causae\" of a particular issue to the courts of the foreign country.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22385390", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22385390", "title": "HADOPI law", "text": "HADOPI law\n\nThe French HADOPI law or Creation and Internet law (, or, loosely in English, \"Supreme Authority for the Distribution and Protection of Intellectual Property on the Internet\") was introduced during 2009, providing what is known as a graduated response as a means to encourage compliance with copyright laws. HADOPI is the acronym of the government agency created to administer it.\n\nThe part of the \"HADOPI law\" that allowed for suspension of internet access to a repeat infringer was revoked on 8 July 2013 by the French government because that penalty was considered to be disproportionate. The power to impose fines or other sanctions on repeat infringers remains in effect.\n\nDespite strong backing from President Nicolas Sarkozy, the bill was rejected by the French National Assembly on 9 April 2009. The French government asked for reconsideration of the bill by the French National Assembly and it was adopted on 12 May 2009 by the assembly, and on 13 May 2009 by the French Senate.\n\nDebate included accusations of dubious tactics made against the promoters of the bill. There were complaints that the government's official website misrepresented the bill, that the French Wikipedia pages on it were falsified by the Ministry of Culture on 14 February 2009. and a \"petition of 10,000 artists\" in support of the bill was questioned as allegedly fraudulent.\n\n\nThe law creates a government agency called \"Haute Autorité pour la Diffusion des Œuvres et la Protection des Droits sur Internet\" (HADOPI) (English: \"Supreme Authority for the Distribution and Protection of Intellectual Property on the Internet\"); replacing a previous agency, the ARMT (Regulation of Technical Measures Authority) created by the DADVSI law.\n\nThe new government agency is headed by a board of nine members, three appointed by the government, two by the legislative bodies, three by judicial bodies and one by the \"Conseil supérieur de la propriété littéraire et artistique\" (Superior Council of Artistic and Literary Property), a government council responsible to the French Ministry of Culture. The agency is vested with the power to police Internet users.\n\nTo ensure that internet subscribers \"screen their internet connections in order to prevent the exchange of copyrighted material without prior agreement from the copyright holders\" (Art. L. 336-3 of the bill). HADOPI also retains mandates previously attributed to the ARMT.\n\nOn receipt of a complaint from a copyright holder or representative, HADOPI may initiate a 'three-strike' procedure:\n\n\nThe ISP is then required to monitor the subject internet connection. In addition, the internet access subscriber is invited to install a filter on his internet connection.\n\nIf, in the 6 months following the first step, a repeat offense is suspected by the copyright holder, his representative, the ISP or HADOPI, the second step of the procedure is invoked.\n\n\nIn the event that the offender fails to comply during the year following the reception of the certified letter, and upon accusation of repeated offenses by the copyright holder, a representative, the ISP or HADOPI, the third step of the procedure is invoked.\n\n\nOffender can seek recourse against the HADOPI, before case transmission, and against the court.\n\nThe internet access subscriber was blacklisted and other ISPs were prohibited from providing an internet connection to the blacklisted subscriber. The service suspension did not, however, interrupt billing, and the offending subscriber was liable to meet any charges or costs resulting from the service termination.\n\nAccording to the CNIL, action under the HADOPI law does not exclude separate prosecution under the French code of Intellectual Property, particularly its articles L331-1 or L335-2, or limit a claimant's other remedies at law. (See CNIL opinion, below).\n\nSince the law was approved in 2009 until abrogation of the suspension of access to a communication service in 2013, only one user has been sentenced to suspension (for 15 days) plus fined for EUR 600. The sentence never applied because of the abrogation some days after.\n\nOn 9 July 2013, the French Ministry of Culture published official decree No. 0157, removing from the law \"the additional misdemeanor punishable by suspension of access to a communication service.\" allegedly because \"the three strikes mechanism had failed to benefit authorized services as promised\". The Minister explained that the stricter copyright policy of the French Government would be revised from going after the end-user to taking punitive sanctions against companies who provide web hosting and telecom infrastructure services which allow copyright infringement to occur. Nevertheless, the fines against users found to be sharing unauthorized content remained standing (\"up to EUR 1500 in cases of gross negligence\"), and ISPs are still required to provide details to identify them.\n\nThe French Culture Minister Aurélie Filippetti explained that the financial costs to the French Government in applying the Hadopi Law was not sound. She disclosed that it cost her Ministry 12 million Euros and 60 civil servants to send 1 million e-mails to copyright infringers and 99,000 registered letters, with only 134 cases examined for prosecution.\n\nImplementation of the European Copyright Directive resulted in the French DADVSI law which has been in force since 2007, creating the crime of \"lack of screening of Internet connections in order to prevent exchange of copyrighted material without prior agreement from the copyright holders\" (art. L335.12). The DADVSI law did not prescribe any punishment.\nIt has been partially invalidated by the Constitutional Council of France's rejection of the principle of escalation, and retains only the crime of copyright-infringement, punishable by up to 3 years' prison and a fine of up to €300,000.\n\nThe HADOPI law is supposed to address the concerns of the Constitutional Council of France, in addition to replacing the DADVSI law, which has yet to be enforced.\n\nOn September 5, 2007, the French Minister of Culture, Christine Albanel asked the CEO of the major French entertainment retailer (Fnac), Denis Olivennes, to lead a task force to study a three-strike sanction, to conform with the ruling of the French Constitutional Council. After consulting representatives of the entertainment industry, internet service providers and consumer associations, the Olivennes committee reported to the Minister on November 23. The report was signed by 40 companies at the Élysée and presented as the \"Olivennes agreement\". It was later renamed the \"Élysée agreement\".\n\nThe HADOPI law is the implementation of the Olivennes report, supported by the Olivennes agreement, in which representatives of the entertainment and media industries gave their assent to the law's enforcement procedures. Nevertheless, some companies, notably the ISPs Orange and Free, later dissented from the agreement.\n\nOwing to its controversial nature, the bill became a subject of intense campaigning in various media, which was redoubled after its parliamentary defeat on April 9, 2009.\n\nOn October 4, 2008, the then French President Nicolas Sarkozy, a personal supporter of the law, interceded with the president of the European Commission regarding an amendment to the EU Telecoms Package that targeted the HADOPI law and the lack of a judicial ruling in the original drafting of it. This was Amendment 138 to the Framework directive as adopted by the European Parliament in the First Reading of the Telecoms Package. The European Commission's response to Sarkozy was that it supported Amendment 138. That remained its position until the Telecoms Package was finally adopted with the so-called Freedom Provision (Directive 2009/140/EC, Article 1.3a).\n\nThe French government created a promotional website in support of the country's entertainment industry. The content of the website was criticised as misleading.\n\nIt was also alleged that French Wikipedia pages relative to HADOPI were edited by the Ministry of Culture on February 14, 2009.\n\nSACEM and other entertainment industry players mounted a petition of \"10,000 artists\" in support of the HADOPI law. The list has been challenged on several grounds:\n\nThe leading French consumer association UFC Que Choisir has positioned itself against the law and has set up a website to support opposition.\n\nA group called \"La Quadrature du Net\" is a strong lobbyist against the law.\n\nFollowing an open letter in the newspaper Libération signed by Chantal Akerman, Christophe Honoré, Jean-Pierre Limosin, Zina Modiano, Gaël Morel, Victoria Abril, Catherine Deneuve, Louis Garrel, Yann Gonzalez, Clotilde Hesme, Chiara Mastroianni, Agathe Berman and Paulo Branco which was published on April 7, 2009, and co-authored notably by Victoria Abril and Catherine Deneuve, an informal group has been constituted under the name \"Creation Public Internet\".\n\nOn March 12, 2009, the British Featured Artists Coalition publicised its opposition to the principle of the HADOPI law.\n\nWith the exception of the French Green Party who campaigned against the law, other political groups represented in the legislative chambers were not active lobbying for or against the law, though individual members did so. The French Socialist Party was probably the most divided. While it initially favored the law (voted \"yes\" in the Senate's first reading), it was chiefly responsible for the surprise rejection of the bill after the first reading in the National Assembly, as well as requesting the Constitutional Council's ruling. The Pirate Party (France) although not represented in the legislative chambers also campaigned against the law.\n\nShortly after HADOPI's agency logo was presented to the public by Minister of Culture and Communication Frédéric Mitterrand, it was revealed that the logo used an unlicensed font. The font was created by typeface designer Jean François Porchez, and is owned by France Télécom. The design agency that drew the logo, Plan Créatif, admitted to using the font by mistake and the logo was redone with another font.\n\n"}

In 2008, the government began to phase it out by making it unavailable to new claimants.\n\nBetween 2011 and 2016 a compulsory reassessment programme moved most pre-2008 Incapacity Benefit recipients onto Employment and Support Allowance, so that by May 2017 fewer than 3000 people were still receiving the full rate of the old benefit (another 70,000 were receiving National Insurance credits).\n\nBy rooting out weak claims and encouraging people with moderate disabilities to find suitable jobs, this reassessment programme was supposed to have saved seven billion pounds a year from the welfare budget by 2018. In practice, this major Whitehall project failed to generate any savings for the Exchequer.\n\nIn Britain, sickness benefits were introduced by David Lloyd George, Winston Churchill and other reformers as one of a number of changes to social security brought about by the National Insurance Act 1911. These Edwardian-era reforms were incorporated into the Welfare State after the Second World War — although until the early 1970s, the post-war National Insurance scheme treated everyone who became eligible for benefits after losing their job in largely the same way, regardless of whether or not they were disabled.\n\nLong-term illness and disability were also addressed to some extent through National Assistance and, from 1966, Supplementary Benefit.\n\nThe prime minister Edward Heath and his secretary of state at the DHSS, Keith Joseph, brought in a raft of new social security payments including Invalidity Benefit, which was introduced in 1971 to go some way towards replacing the wages of people who had been 'invalided out' of their occupation after developing a long-term illness or a disability. It was worth more than unemployment benefit that was paid to people without disabilities.\n\nTania Burchardt from the London School of Economics has described the 1970s and 1980s as decades that were notable for an \"improvement of the coverage of earnings-replacement benefits\".\n\nIn 1995, the Conservative Secretary of State for Social Security, Peter Lilley, abolished Invalidity Benefit and replaced it with Incapacity Benefit after the Prime Minister of the day, John Major, had complained about the burgeoning caseload, saying: \"Frankly, it beggars belief that so many more people have suddenly become invalids, especially at a time when the health of the population has improved\".\n\nA new feature of Incapacity Benefit was that officials could ask for claimants' disabilities to be confirmed using a bespoke testing procedure – the All Work Test – carried out by doctors working for the government. Another feature was that claimants would be assessed on their ability to do any job, not just their old trade. And unlike its predecessor, Incapacity Benefit was taxable. Nevertheless, the caseload continued to rise.\n\nAfter 2000, some recipients underwent a Personal Capability Assessment to establish whether their condition had improved: if it had, benefit payments could be withdrawn; otherwise, a Capability Report was drawn up by the examining doctor and used by Job Centre staff to plan ways to boost recipients' employability, in the hope of returning them to work. This new test was also used to assess some fresh claims for Incapacity Benefit.\n\nIn 2004, the caseload peaked at just under 2,500,000 then began to fall slowly.\n\nIn late 2008, New Labour replaced Incapacity Benefit with Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) for new claims and yet another eligibility test was introduced: the Work Capability Assessment. At the same time, capacity was boosted by bringing in nurses to carry out the bulk of the medical assessments using a new semi-structured interview technique, with the findings recorded in digital format. This meant that from 2008, most new claims were scrutinised by a healthcare professional; those whose claims reached the threshold for eligibility were granted ESA - either shortly after the initial assessment, following an internal review of the initial decision, or after an external appeal.\n\nAfter the introduction of ESA, the number of remaining Incapacity Benefit recipients dwindled (largely as people came off the benefit for reasons such as reaching the State Pension age): by early 2011, the Incapacity Benefit caseload had shrunk by more than 500,000.\n\nThe Coalition government decided to implement the plan to reassess most remaining Incapacity Benefit recipients. This reassessment programme, which began in early 2011 and was effectively completed in 2016, used an updated version of the Work Capability Assessment. Recipients confirmed as having 'limited capability for work' – often colloquially, but not technically accurately, referred to as being 'unfit for work' – were transferred onto ESA; any found fully capable of work would, in theory, have had their Incapacity Benefit payments stopped and then been invited to consider applying for Jobseekers Allowance (JSA).\n\nIn practice, many Incapacity Benefit recipients declared 'fit for work' formally appealed against the decision, at which stage 40% of decisions challenged were overturned and the claimant moved onto ESA, not JSA. Furthermore, some people taken off Incapacity Benefit after their reassessment claimed ESA successfully at a later date when their illness worsened.\n\nBy May 2017, fewer than 3000 people were still receiving the old payment — although the number of people on Employment and Support Allowance had grown from zero to more than 2.4 million over the preceding nine years.\n\nThe number of claimants of sickness benefits increased rapidly from the mid-1980s. The trend was investigated in a series of studies commissioned by the government in 1991 and published in 1993. Several possible causes were identified:\n\nThe House of Commons research paper that summarised the studies' findings in the 1990s concluded that the number of new claims and their general pattern had not changed significantly; what had changed was the rate at which recipients were coming \"off\" the benefit to move back into work (after their illness had begun to improve, for instance, or by finding a job \"despite\" their disability) - it had fallen.\n\nThe bulk of the rise in the caseload occurred during the late 1980s, the 1990s and the first years of the 21st century. In 2004, the caseload began to \"fall\" slowly.\n\nMinisters complained about a \"sick-note culture\" that allowed people to drift onto Incapacity Benefit. A medical certificate from a GP is the first step onto sickness benefits; although a government-run eligibility test was brought in alongside Incapacity Benefit in 1995, critics said that officials still accepted too many claims using information supplied by the claimants themselves and their GPs without asking for an All Work Test to be performed, partly because the pool of medical assessors was relatively small and partly because doctors' time was costly - which was why large numbers of nurses were brought in to perform the new test introduced in 2008.\n\nWelfare reformers said that once claimants had been granted Incapacity Benefit they became \"trapped\" in the system. In fact, there was nothing in the regulations that inherently trapped people on Incapacity Benefit: recipients were free to relinquish their payments and seek work if they felt able to, although the meagre gains from moving into a poorly paid and insecure job were thought to act as a deterrent to doing so - a phenomenon that Working Tax Credits and Universal Credit were designed to mitigate.\n\nIn 2011, out-of-work sickness benefits had an annual cost of £13billion: the Chancellor, George Osborne, called this \"a very large budget\". The total annual budget of the Department for Work and Pensions in 2011 was £180 billion, with the largest slice by far - almost half - being spent on the State Pension, followed by Housing Benefit at slightly under £30 billion. Tax Credits, administered by the Treasury, cost roughly the same as Housing Benefit.\n\nIf out-of-work sickness benefits costs were combined with those of the other disability benefits - the bulk of which go to the elderly - the total would be around £33 billion.\n\nDWP data on the outcomes of new claims - \"not\" reassessments of existing Incapacity Benefit recipients - drawn from the first two years of ESA's availability showed the following:\nThe remaining 37% ceased claiming for unspecified reasons in the course of the 13-week application and assessment process; some might have abandoned a weak claim as the assessment approached, others might have recovered from their illness, injury or recent surgery or found a new job - the proportions are unknown.\n\nWhen the unassessed 37% are removed from the equation, the results were:\n\nCommentators and policy-makers suspected that a large chunk of people on Incapacity Benefit had got better but had kept this quiet and were still receiving payments. Another, more charitable, view was that recent disability legislation and changes in the workplace might have removed some of the barriers to disabled people returning to work.\n\nIn two pilot studies of the Work Capability Assessment as a tool for judging the fitness for work of long-term Incapacity Benefit recipients – when 1,347 disabled people living in Aberdeen and Burnley, who had been on their benefit for at least two years, were assessed in late 2010 – provisional results suggested that:\n\nThe reliability of this provisional data has been challenged, since many of those categorised as 'fit for work' subsequently won their appeals against the initial decision, suggesting that the results of the pilot studies overstated the percentage of claimants who were capable of finding a job.\n\nWith the passage of time, experience showed that the vast majority of Incapacity Benefit recipients also met the more stringent criteria for ESA as well, and the combined total of people on these benefits hardly changed between 2008 and 2015. Furthermore, the generic rehabilitation programme for those on ESA who were considered to be able to work in the future – the Work Programme – proved largely ineffective in returning them to work.\n\nIn February 2005, the BBC analysed New Labour's record on welfare reform:\nThe following year Tony Blair appointed David Freud, a former vice-chairman of investment banking at UBS, as an advisor on out-of-work benefit reform. Freud's 2007 report called for the greater use of private sector companies who would be paid by results, and for substantial resources to be made available to help people on Incapacity Benefit back into work.\n\nIn 2008 a Green Paper was published, which James Purnell said was \"inspired by the reforms proposed by David Freud\". It declared that \"between 2009 and 2013, all Incapacity Benefit claimants will be reassessed using a medical assessment called the Work Capability Assessment (WCA)\". However, a decision later that year to overhaul the test's criteria delayed the start of the reassessment programme.\n\nIn the autumn of 2010, with Freud now a government minister responsible for welfare reform, two pilot studies took place. 1347 people who had been on Incapacity Benefit for more than two years were assessed against the new criteria that would be used to gauge the fitness for work of more than two million such people from the spring of the following year.\n\nIn 2010, the new Conservative Secretary of State for Work and Pensions asked Professor Malcolm Harrington, an occupational medicine specialist, to review the operation of the WCA. \"The Guardian\" summarised Professor Harrington's opinion as being that the test was \"impersonal\", it \"lacked empathy\" and it was too reliant on \"computer systems and drop-down menus\". In the executive summary of his report, he wrote that the \"WCA is not working as well as it should. There are clear and consistent criticisms of the whole system and much negativity surrounding the process...[but] I do not believe the system is broken or beyond repair. I am proposing a substantial series of recommendations to improve the fairness and effectiveness of the WCA. If adopted, I believe these changes can have a positive impact on the process.\"\n\nShortly before the Incapacity Benefit reassessment programme began, Professor Paul Gregg, an economist and one of the original architects of ESA, warned that the WCA was \"badly malfunctioning\" and urged further pilot studies before the new version was used to retest existing sickness benefit recipients. Three months later, six experts in mental health — including the chief executive of MIND, who was already a senior advisor to the DWP on the WCA — wrote to \"The Guardian\" to say that the test was \"deeply flawed\".\n\nProfessor Harrington asked MIND, Mencap and the National Autistic Society to \"provide recommendations on refining the mental, intellectual and cognitive descriptors\" but the DWP's own doctors were not convinced by the evidence presented. The department decided to set up an 'evidence-based review' to look in more detail at the proposed changes, which concluded that the existing criteria \"produced consistent results on the whole\" and that the WCA was already \"an accurate indicator of work capability as compared with expert opinion\". DWP ministers replaced Professor Harrington once he had submitted his third annual report in 2012.\n\nIn 2013, \"The Guardian\" quoted Professor Harrington as saying: \"I would have preferred to do a roll-out [the IB reassessment] in the second year [2012]\" and as having told the DWP this before the Incapacity Benefit reassessment programme began. The DWP told the newspaper it had no record of a warning of this kind being given by Professor Harrington. Furthermore, the minister who had formally initiated the 'roll out' had said in Parliament that beforehand Professor Harrington had told him: \"I believe the system is in sufficient shape for you to proceed with Incapacity Benefit reassessment\".\n\nWhen asked later about this discrepancy, Professor Harrington replied:\nIn June 2013, all established Atos WCA assessors were unexpectedly retrained as part of a \"quality improvement plan\" revealed by the DWP the following month, which resulted in longer assessments for the same fee and a shortage of assessors willing and able to carry them out. By July, Atos had decided not to bid for a contract to carry out the test on the Isle of Man.\n\nIn December 2013, the Minister for Disabled People told a parliamentary committee that top level talks had been taking place with Atos:\nIn February 2014, \"The Guardian\" was sent a document that purported to outline the future of the DWP's relationship with Atos. The newspaper described the document in terms that suggested that ministers were preparing to \"oust\" Atos from the WCA contract. In response to this apparent leaking of confidential information to the press, Atos told the newspaper that the contract wasn't working for \"either\" party and it defended its employees in the face of the pressure they were under, saying the \"constant flow of criticism\" endured by the company \"inevitably has an impact on our staff, who diligently endeavour to carry out assessments as laid out in DWP guidelines\".\n\nA few days later, as disabled people staged protests outside Atos assessment centres nationwide, the French contractor told \"The Financial Times\" that it had been trying to get out of the WCA contract since 2013. The firm said: \"For several months now, we have been endeavouring to agree an early exit from the work capability assessment contract\" and said that one reason it wanted to quit was that the WCA was \"not working\". The BBC said its Whitehall sources were \"furious\" that the company had unilaterally announced its intention to end the contract.\n\nThe following month, the Disabilities Minister confirmed in Parliament that the contract with Atos was in the process of being brought to a premature close, with Atos paying a \"substantial financial settlement\" to the DWP as part of a mutual agreement to terminate the WCA contract early (although it would be another year before a new company — Maximus — began to carry out WCAs). The DWP continued to employ the French firm to assess most claims for the Personal Independence Payment and Atos IT staff continued to run the computer system used in the WCA, even after Maximus had taken over the rest of the testing process.\n\nIn early 2014, the DWP called a halt to reassessments. In the summer, the BBC reported a backlog of more than half a million \"new\" ESA claims. Both were the result of a bottleneck caused by longer assessments and the departure (while Atos still held the WCA contract) of hundreds of medical assessors — unintended consequences of the \"quality improvement programme\" announced by the DWP the previous summer.\n\nMaximus Inc. took over a revised version of the WCA contract on 1 March 2015.\n\nThe DWP hoped that a new contract and a new outsourcing partner would mean the start of a new chapter for the reassessment process. However, executives from Atos complained that their firm had been lambasted for doing nothing other than \"applying the legislation the government had laid out\", adding that it was \"massively over-simplistic\" to think that choosing a different outsourcer would, in itself, deal with the flaws in the DWP-designed process.\n\nMaximus said it would improve evidence-gathering prior to a face-to-face assessment, introduce specialist assessors for particular types of disability and communicate more effectively with claimants. The firm acknowledged that hundreds more healthcare professionals would have to be recruited again in order to clear the backlog of ESA claims and hit the contract's new target of one million assessments a year.\n\nAt the end of October 2015, the DWP's director-general of finance was bullish about hitting this higher target when he appeared before a parliamentary committee, saying: \"We are confident that [Maximus] will over-achieve the amounts of work over and above the forecast that was set\". But at the start of November, Maximus's senior management team warned\nits shareholders that volume targets were not being met. The company stated that although recruitment of healthcare professionals had improved, their training and retention was still a problem, with a shortfall of assessors expected to last until the autumn of 2016. On the same day, the price of shares in the company fell sharply, losing more than 20% of their value.\n\nIn January 2016, the National Audit Office (NAO) published its evaluation of the DWP's health and disability assessment contracts. It said the cost of each WCA had risen from £115 under Atos to £190 under Maximus. The report went on to say that Maximus was facing \"significant challenges with staff failing to complete training requirements\" and revealed that in July 2015 — less than six months into the new contract — the DWP had been obliged to draw up a 'performance improvement plan' with Maximus because \"volume targets were not being met\". The NAO also declared that the DWP had \"allowed bidders to make assumptions about staff training that it knew were overly optimistic and difficult to achieve\" and implied that the target set by the DWP of one million assessments a year was too ambitious, saying: \"One experienced bidder withdrew from the process because it could not meet the required number of assessments\".\n\nIn April 2016, sources close to the new Welfare Secretary, Stephen Crabb, told \"The Sunday Times\" that a contract with Maximus was \"under scrutiny\", which the newspaper implied was the WCA contract. In early May, Maximus senior executives admitted that the target of one million WCAs a year had been \"very, very challenging\" then revealed that government planners had lowered their expectations after a spending review. The executives said:\nAt the beginning of October 2016, the recently appointed Work and Pensions Secretary, Damian Green, said it was \"pointless\" to reassess claimants if it was clear that their clinical condition had no realistic prospect of improvement or would only get worse.\n\nAt the end of October 2016, the government published a Green Paper asking for ideas on how to reform ESA and its eligibility test in the future.\n\nThe Incapacity Benefit reassessment programme had originally been expected to save seven billion pounds a year from the welfare budget.\n\nIn 2015 the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) found that no savings had been made to date: the sickness benefit budget remained at more than £13billion a year. Furthermore, because many more claimants than forecast were being placed in the Support Group, the government's fiscal watchdog \"raised\" its estimate for spending on sickness benefits by one billion pounds a year.\n\nIn 2016 the OBR said that the reforms had still made no impact on the level of welfare spending — although a simple freezing of benefit payments, so that they did not rise with inflation, had made some savings for the Treasury.\n\nProfessor Jonathan Portes, formerly the chief economist at the DWP and later the director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, has described the Incapacity Benefit reassessment programme as \"the biggest single social policy failure of the last fifteen years\".\n"}

{"id": "2575061", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2575061", "title": "James Braidwood (firefighter)", "text": "James Braidwood (firefighter)\n\nJames Braidwood (1800–1861) was a Scottish firefighter who founded of the world's first municipal fire service in Edinburgh in 1824. He was the first director of the \"London Fire Engine Establishment\" (the brigade which was eventually to become the London Fire Brigade). He is credited with the development of the modern municipal fire service.\n\nHe was born in Edinburgh the tenth child of Janet Mitchell and Francis James Braidwood, a cabinetmaker. He was educated at the Royal High School. He learned about the construction of buildings after joining his father's building firm as an apprentice, knowledge he was later to put to good use.\n\nAppointed Master of Fire Engines at the age of 24, two months prior to the Great Fire of Edinburgh, Braidwood established principles of fire-fighting that are still applied today. His training as a surveyor gave him exceptional knowledge of the behaviour of building materials and housing conditions in the Old Town of Edinburgh. He recruited to the service expert tradesmen – slaters, carpenters, masons and plumbers – who could apply their various fields of expertise to fire fighting. He also recruited experienced mariners for an occupation that required heavy manual work in hauling engines and trundling wheeled escape ladders up and down Edinburgh's steep streets, as well as nimble footwork when negotiating rooftops and moving through partially destroyed buildings. His many original ideas of practical organisation and methodology, published in 1830, were adopted throughout Britain. He was, however, resistant to the introduction of steam-driven engines. In 1833 he left Edinburgh to lead the London Fire Engine Establishment. The London Fire Engine Establishment had to fight a blaze at the Palace of Westminster, on 16 October 1834, that destroyed almost all of the Palace. \n\nBraidwood was distinguished for his heroism on the occasion of great fires in Edinburgh (1824) and London (1830). He also undertook a pastoral role, introducing visits to ordinary firemen and their families by the London City Mission.\n\nAs a strange curiosity, Braidwood was the first witness at the trial of William Burke of Burke and Hare fame. He gave evidence on Christmas Eve of 1828, in his capacity as an Edinburgh builder, who had been commissioned by the authorities to draw scale plans of the notorious lodging house on Tanners Close where the murders took place. His evidence was simply to state that the plans were an accurate representation of the building.\n\nOn 22 June 1861 he died in the Tooley Street fire at Cotton's Wharf near London Bridge station when a falling wall crushed him, three hours after the fire began. It took two days to recover his body and his heroism led to a massive funeral on 29 June where his funeral cortege stretched one and a half miles behind the hearse, a public spectacle equal almost to the Tooley Street fire itself. The fire, which continued to burn for a fortnight, caused £2,000,000 worth of damage. A London fireboat was named in his honour in the 1930s.\n\nBraidwood is buried at Abney Park Cemetery, Stoke Newington, London, not far from the Stoke Newington Fire Station. The grave lies on a path edge towards the south, rendering it relatively easy to see in this congested and overgrown cemetery. His wife, Mary Ann Jane Braidwood (1806–1871) was buried with him.\n\nThe grave was long lost to public view and in 1981, following much research by the then Stoke Newington Fire Station White Watch Station Officer, Liam Hackett, the precise location of the grave was found. Hackett then spent the rest of the Summer clearing the site and restoring the lettering on the monument.\n\nThe death of James Braidwood, whilst engaged in fire fighting duties, is recorded on the National Firefighters Memorial which is located adjacent to St Paul's Cathedral in the City of London.\n\nA group of former London Firefighters decided to form a new Masonic Lodge. They chose to remember the life and death of this famous fireman by naming the Lodge after him. Consecrated in 2005 this is now known as the Braidwood Lodge Number 9802 in the Province of West Kent.\n\nRecognising the lack of publications on fire engines in the English language, Braidwood published what is regarded as one of the first text books on the science of fire engineering in 1830: \"On the Construction of Fire Engines and Apparatus\". Although many historical (Public domain) books often are re-published, Braidwood's book was officially re-published as a second edition in 2004. Braidwood also authored \"Fire prevention and fire extinction\", published posthumously in 1866.\n\nOn 5 September 2008, the James Braidwood memorial statue in Parliament Square, Edinburgh was unveiled by Professor Sir Timothy O'Shea, Principal of the University of Edinburgh. A fund had been established for a £75,000 memorial to Braidwood, to be created by the Glasgow sculptor, Kenneth Mackay, led by Dr Frank Rushbrook CBE, 93-year-old former Firemaster at Lothian & Borders Fire Brigade. The statue stands around the corner from the site of the original main fire station in the High Street. The bronze plaque below it reads:\n\nDr Rushbrook was also the benefactor of the Fire Laboratory that lies at the heart of the BRE Centre for Fire Safety Engineering, in the School of Engineering at the University of Edinburgh. His gift was motivated by a desire to promote education in applied fire science, and is routinely used for experimental classes on the undergraduate and taught postgraduate fire programmes at the University, together with PhD/post-doctoral research and also on occasion by fire service personnel. The laboratory was officially opened in 2003, and has since been expanded to two floors.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "16379", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16379", "title": "Jedi", "text": "Jedi\n\nThe Jedi are the main protagonists in the \"Star Wars\" universe. They are depicted as an ancient monastic, academic, meritocratic and paramilitary organization whose origin dates back approximately 25,000 years before the events of the first film released in the franchise.\n\nThe Jedi Order mostly consists of polymaths: teachers, philosophers, scientists, engineers, physicians, diplomats and warriors. The Jedi value knowledge and wisdom, adhere to slave morality, and serve others through acts of charity, citizenship, and volunteerism; this ideology is a recurring theme in the \"Star Wars\" universe. The Jedi denounce emotions as the root of mortal suffering; they believe fear, anger and love cause sentient beings to lash out in conflict and impede rational action to do what is right. Their traditional weapon is the lightsaber, a device which generates a blade-like plasma powered by a kyber crystal. The fictional organization has inspired a real-world new religious movement, Jediism.\nThe word \"Jedi\" is said to have been adapted by George Lucas from Japanese 時代劇 (jidaigeki) (meaning \"period drama\" motion pictures about samurai), or perhaps inspired by the words \"Jed\" (King) and \"Jeddak\" (Emperor) in the Barsoom series by Edgar Rice Burroughs, a series that Lucas considered adapting to film. The film \"Rogue One\" suggests that it relates to the planet Jedha, source of the kyber crystals used in lightsabers.\n\nThe term \"padawan\", which is used to refer to the fictional Jedi apprentices, appears to originate in Sanskrit and can be understood as \"learner\", both in Sanskrit and by contemporary native speakers of Sanskrit-based languages.\n\nGeorge Lucas acknowledged Jedi, Sith, and other Force concepts have been inspired by many sources. These include: knighthood chivalry, paladinism, samurai bushido, Shaolin Monastery, Feudalism, Hinduism, Qigong, Greek philosophy, Greek mythology, Roman history, Roman mythology, parts of the Abrahamic religions, Confucianism, Shintō, Buddhism and Taoism, not to mention countless cinematic precursors. The works of philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche and mythologist Joseph Campbell, especially his book \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\" (1949), directly influenced Lucas, and was what drove him to create the 'modern myth' of \"Star Wars\".\n\nAs depicted in the canon, the Jedi study and utilize the Force, in order to help and protect those in need. The Jedi members, known as Jedi Knights, respect all life by defending and protecting those who cannot do it for themselves, striving for peaceful and non-combative solutions to any altercations they encounter and fighting only in self-defense and for the defense of those they protect. Like their evil counterparts, the Sith, their main weapon is the lightsaber. By training the mind and the body, the Jedi seek to improve themselves by gaining unfettered access to the Force while also seeking to improve those individuals and groups they come in contact with.\n\nThe Lost Twenty was the name given to a group of Jedi Masters—numbering twenty in total—who left the Jedi Order throughout its history. The first twelve of these ‘Lost Twenty’ left the Jedi Order before the Third Great Schism; these twelve Masters later became \"Dark Jedi\" who eventually founded the first Sith Empire. In the standard years preceding the Clone Wars, Jedi Master Dooku left the Jedi Order as a result of differences with his fellow Jedi, becoming the twentieth Jedi Master in the history of the Order to do so. To commemorate these former Jedi, memorial statue busts were displayed at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant.\n\nThe prequel films depict the Jedi in their prime, dealing with the rising presence of the dark side of the Force and determined to fight their mortal enemies, the Sith. In \"Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace\" (1999), Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) discovers nine-year-old Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), whom he believes to be the \"Chosen One\" of a Jedi prophecy who is destined to bring balance to the Force; the boy is eventually paired with Qui-Gon's apprentice, the young Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), who promises to train him. The sequel, \"Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones\", establishes that the Jedi forswear all emotional attachments, including romantic love, which proves problematic when Anakin, now a young adult (Hayden Christensen), falls in love with Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman), whom Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi had served ten years before. In \"\", Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), who is later revealed to be Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith, manipulates Anakin's love for Padmé and distrust of the Jedi in order to turn him to the dark side and become his Sith apprentice, Darth Vader. Once corrupted, Vader helps Palpatine hunt down and destroy nearly all of the Jedi, leaving very few left, such as Jedi Masters Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Anakin’s former Padawan, Ahsoka Tano.\n\nIn accordance with Order 66, for crimes of \"sedition and high-treason\" against the Galactic Republic, the Jedi are nearly exterminated by the Clone Army and Sith Lord Darth Sidious; only Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda, who were amongst a handful of a hundred survivors, avoided the initial purge. The first person to be issued this order was Clone Commander Cody (who until then was under the command of Jedi General Kenobi). Darth Vader led Operation: Knightfall against the Jedi Temple with the 501st Legion while the rest of the clone army around the galaxy carried out Order 66. Palpatine convinced the people of the Republic that Jedi were corrupted warmongers responsible for prolonging the Clone Wars; the Jedi became universally hated with huge bounties placed on them. Darth Vader continued to hunt and execute nearly every surviving Jedi during the first 10 years of the Empire's history; only Yoda survived long enough to die of old age.\n\nThe Jedi are first introduced in the 1977 motion picture \"Star Wars\" as an order of warrior monks who serve as \"the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy\" and embrace the mystical Force. Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness)\nexplains that the Galactic Empire had all but exterminated the Jedi some twenty years before the events of the film, and seeks to train Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) to be the Jedi Order's last hope. Darth Vader (David Prowse/James Earl Jones) is also established as the Jedi's main enemy. By the end of the film, Luke is on the path to becoming a Jedi. In the sequel, \"The Empire Strikes Back\", Luke receives extensive Jedi training from the elderly (and only surviving) Jedi Master Yoda (Frank Oz), even as he learns that Vader is, in fact, his father, former Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker. The third film in the original trilogy, \"Return of the Jedi\", ends with Luke redeeming Vader and helping to destroy the Empire, thus fulfilling his destiny as a Jedi.\n\nIn the \"sequel\"-trilogy film series however, Luke's attempts to restore the Jedi Order took a turn for the worse instead when one of his apprentices, his nephew Ben, is drawn to the Dark side by Supreme Leader Snoke and becomes Kylo Ren. He is convinced to destroy all that Luke has built, murdering most of Luke's apprentices in the occasion. After Ren's fall and the destruction of the New Jedi Order, Luke goes into a self-imposed exile on Ahch-To, believing himself and the Jedi to be a negative influence on the galaxy as a whole.\n\nIn the sequel \"\", the scavenger Rey discovers Luke on Ahch-to and convinces him to train her in the ways of the Force. During her training, Luke describes the hubris of a full-fledged Jedi order, one that allowed Darth Sidious . She also discovers several ancient Jedi texts hidden away in a tree. Rey learns the truth about Ben's fall to the Dark Side and believes herself to be his only chance of redemption. Luke does not go with her, staying on Ahch-To. Luke attempts to burn the tree down, but cannot bring himself to do so. However, Yoda appears as a Force Ghost to mentor Luke one more time, burning the tree and teaching him that failure is just as important as success, and that Masters are defined by those who surpassed them. When the First Order launches an attack on the Resistance on Crait, Luke appears to stall the oncoming forces. He and Kylo Ren engage in a duel on the battlefield, Ren apparently striking him down. Luke reveals to Ren that he has been projecting an image of himself across the galaxy. On Ahch-To, an exhausted Luke meditates, facing the sunset. He hallucinates a binary sunset and fades away, becoming one with the Force. Rey has stolen the Jedi texts and loads them onto the Millennium Falcon to continue her training.\n\nThe exact size of the Pre-Purge Jedi's membership and operations are never specified. However, in the \"Star Wars Rebels\" episode \"Path of the Jedi\", Kanan Jarrus stated: \"...There were around 10,000 Jedi Knights defending the galaxy. Now, we are few. But in those days, we had small outposts, temples spread throughout the stars. The Empire sought out these temples and destroyed many of them...\"\n\n\nYoda was a wise, experienced, and powerful Grand Master of the Jedi of an unknown species and the oldest known prophet (at least 900+ years) in existence, considered the wisest and most powerful Jedi Master within the \"Star Wars\" universe. He was knighted at age 100, and spent the next eight centuries mentoring several generations of Jedi, about 20,000 of which he took as Padawans. During this period, the green Jedi Master formed good relations with the Wookies of Kashyyyk on numerous occasions, such as when he saved their Terentatek.\n\nMace Windu was a male human Jedi Weapons Master of the High Council and one of the last members of the Order's upper echelons before the fall of the Galactic Republic. Born into a tribe of nomads on the planet Haruun Kal, Windu was offered to Jedi anthropologists as a blessing to regain his people's connection to the Force when he was 6 months old, sometime after his parents died in the bordering jungle. He was taken as a Padawan by Mirialan Jedi Master Cyslin Myr, and began using a unique talent of seeing \"shatterpoints\", or faultlines in the Force that could affect the destinies of certain individuals, and indeed the galaxy itself. Knighted early in his career, the esteemed Windu progressed up the Jedi ranks until reaching his place on the Council, from which he was known as one of the most powerful Jedi and possibly the greatest swordsman of his time.\nHe first appeared in \"\", where he expressed doubt regarding Qui-Gon Jinn's conclusion about Darth Maul (who attacked him on Tatooine during the mission to escort Queen Amidala of Naboo from her Trade Federation-blockaded homeworld), but nonetheless assured the Council that their full resources would be utilized to verify the theory that the Sith could have returned. The weapons master was even the most reluctant to train young Anakin Skywalker (who Jinn believed was the prophesied Chosen One) at Jinn's request. In \"\", he led a party of 200 Jedi on a mission to rescue Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amidala from Separatist captivity on Geonosis, where he was able to defeat and kill the bounty hunter Jango Fett in the battle that followed. In the Clone Wars, he served the Republic as an overseer of the war effort and advisor to Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine as well as taking part in such conflicts such as the Battles of Malastare and Dantooine.\n\nQui-Gon Jinn was a wise and powerful male human Jedi Master, and the Master of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Unlike other, more conservative Jedi, he values living in the moment as the best way to embrace the Force. While other Jedi respect him highly, they are frequently puzzled by his unorthodox beliefs and ultimately deny him a seat on the Jedi Council, despite him being among the wisest and most powerful of the Jedi.\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi was a male human Jedi Master who initiated Anakin and Luke Skywalker to the Jedi arts and served as a central character during the events of the Clone Wars. Obi-Wan proved himself an adept strategist, duelist, and spy, as his leadership style heavily favored subterfuge and misdirection while commanding clone troopers, or wielding the Force.\n\nAnakin Skywalker was a human male Jedi Knight and main protagonist of the prequel trilogy. He was apprenticed to Obi-Wan Kenobi and proved to be a very gifted duelist and Force user, being appointed to the Jedi High Council at the age of 23, though being denied the rank of Master. He secretly married Padme Amidala and had two children. He eventually fell to the Dark Side and became Darth Vader. While he was not technically a Jedi Master, he was a member of the Old Jedi Council, and trained a Padawan of his own, Ahsoka Tano during the Clone Wars, who dutifully called him \"Master\".\n\nKanan Jarrus was a human male Jedi who fought for the Rebellion during its formation. First introduced as a principle character of the animated television series \"Star Wars Rebels\", Jarrus is known to be the leader of a small rebel cell called the Spectres, operating on the planet Lothal. As a survivor of Order 66, Jarrus is forced to break certain Jedi traditions to avoid being detected by Imperial forces that continue their mission to eliminate any Jedi on sight, such as eschewing traditional Jedi robes or occasionally using a blaster, a weapon typically shunned by Jedi. After the Spectres rescued the young Ezra Bridger, Jarrus discovered his Force potential and successfully trains him to become a Jedi. As he trains Bridger and battles Imperial forces, Jarrus' actions draw the attention of the Imperial Inquisitorius, a special task force of Force-attuned individuals who are specialized in hunting and eliminating Jedi, and he occasionally crosses paths with them. Jarrus later earned the title of Jedi Knight during his conflict with the Inquisitors, but shortly after the last of them were defeated at the Sith temple on Malachor, he was betrayed and blinded by the former Sith Lord known only as Maul, who assisted in eliminating them solely to pursue his own goals. Kanan then continued serving the Rebellion as it faced the Imperial tactician Grand Admiral Thrawn, before sacrificing his own life to help his fellow cell members succeed in rescuing one of their own, while simultaneously disrupting production of the Imperial TIE Defender, a powerful starfighter that could have doomed the growing Rebellion.\n\nEzra Bridger is a human male who was born on the planet Lothal precisely on the day the Galactic Empire was established. He witnessed many injustices of the Imperial occupation of his homeworld for much of his childhood and was separated from his parents from a very early age. He was able to survive alone using street smarts and skills, but was discovered by Kanan Jarrus to have potential Force sensitivity after he encounters the Spectres for the first time. After discovering how much of a team player he could be during a rescue operation, they recruit Bridger, tasking Jarrus to begin training him in the ways of the Jedi, a task made difficult by the premature death of Jarrus' master, Depa Bilaba, executed after the Clone Wars. It would be weeks before Bridger would lay his hands on a lightsaber, which was uniquely designed to accommodate his early inability to deflect projectiles with a built-in knuckle guard and mini-blaster, and even so, he was more skilled at battling stormtroopers, rather than the Inquisitors or Darth Vader, the latter who easily bested him in combat and disarmed him. After a dangerous mission to the planet Malachor to discover the key to defeating the Sith, Bridger recovers a Sith holocron believed to hold the answers he sought, becoming the first ever known Jedi to open a Sith holocron, but soon fell under its sway for some time as he improved his combat skills and was even promoted to commander in the Rebel ranks. It is not until after some encounters with the former Sith Lord Maul does Bridger discover that Obi-Wan Kenobi holds the key to the Sith's undoing, as he will train Luke Skywalker to confront his corrupted father. \n\nBridger continued taking part in the Rebellion's war against the Empire, even as they faced the Imperial strategist Grand Admiral Thrawn. Throughout his service, Bridger also discovered that in spite of his early combat troubles, he could uniquely develop an ability to communicate with animals, using the Force, and command them to do his bidding. This skill would prove useful several times, including a moment when Bridger uses it to finally drive out Thrawn's forces from Lothal once and for all through the strength of purgills, large interstellar creatures. This brought a long-awaited end to the Imperial occupation of his homeworld, but at the cost of being unable to continue being with the Spectres or see his people enjoy their hard-won freedom.\n\nLuke Skywalker was a male human Grand Master of the Jedi and the protagonist of the \"Star Wars\" original trilogy. As the last Padawan of Obi-Wan Kenobi, he became an important figure in the Rebel Alliance's struggle against the Galactic Empire. Luke is heir to a family deeply rooted in the Force, being the twin brother of Rebellion leader Princess Leia Organa of the planet Alderaan, the son of former Queen of Naboo and Republic Senator Padmé Amidala and Jedi turned Sith Lord Darth Vader (Anakin Skywalker), and the maternal uncle of Ben Solo. After redeeming his father from the Dark Side of the Force, Luke set out to train a new generation of Jedi to rebuild the Order, only to have them wiped out by Ren. Skywalker then spent the rest of his life in exile on Ahch-To, with a final heroic act of using Force Projection to distract Ren and help the Resistance flee the planet Crait.\n\nRey (Star Wars) was a human female Jedi Padawan and Scavenger and one of the main protagonists of the sequel trilogy. She is allied with the Resistance and helped to find Luke Skywalker. She found him on the planet of Ahch-To where he spent the rest of his life. She is also the pilot of the Millennium Falcon with Chewbacca. As the Padawan of Luke Skywalker, She proved that she is powerful with the force and good at dueling. She is now currently the Last Living Jedi since Skywalker joined The Force.\n\nThe Jedi Code was a set of rules that governed the behavior of the Jedi Order. It taught its followers to not give in to feelings of anger toward other lifeforms, which would help them resist fear and prevent them from falling to the dark side of the Force.<br>\nThe Four Branches of the Jedi Council are fictional institutions from the \"Star Wars\" universe. They serve the Jedi Order as an organized administrative body that governed the Order's academies, temples, interests and organizations.\n\nThe Jedi High Council is the main ecclesiastical leadership of the Jedi Order, which is a spiritual, philosophical and paramilitary organization. The Jedi High Council is made up of some of the strongest, wisest and most experienced members of the Jedi Order. They are elected to lead the Jedi.\n\nThe Council of First Knowledge administered the Temple-based academy and its curriculum, and funded scholar's scientific research. To this end, the Council guarded and maintained the Temple Archives and its holocron vaults, as well as the \"Shadow program\" at the Jedi Temple: Jedi Sentinels tasked with hunting down Sith artifacts.\n\nThe Council of Reconciliation dealt with the Galactic Senate and the Republic Diplomatic Corps in order to help bring diplomatic resolutions to conflicts and end political standoffs. The \"first face\" of the Republic presented to worlds interested in joining the Republic, this Council would dispatch Jedi diplomats and ambassadors to moderate debate and hammer out treaties\n\nThe Council of Reassignment administered the Jedi Service Corps and each of its branch councils. Organizing work for those Initiates who failed out of the academy and Knights with special talents, the Reassignment Council oversaw this branch's missions and assignments.\n\nMembers of the Order progress through four educational stages, at times referred to as levels:\n\nInitiation is the first part of Jedi training; they are mentored by Jedi Masters in rudimentary control over the Force and basic self-defense techniques.\n\nMost Initiates were typically Youngling (a child Jedi-in-training) receiving early and first-class education. When Jedi Sentinels discover or test a suitable \"force-sensitive\" candidate, they are taken to the Jedi Academy at the age of 5 (depending on the species and arbitrary years) with the parent's permission. Jedi scholarship educations are considered prestigious, as most parents are portrayed as either happy or proud of the opportunity, but sad since they are unlikely to see their child again before adulthood. Younglings were portrayed training under Jedi Master Yoda in a scene on \"Attack of the Clones\" and hiding during the assault on the Jedi Temple in \"Revenge of the Sith\".\n\nThe “Young Jedi” story arc and the episode “Path of the Jedi” explored the Jedi tradition called \"The Gathering\"; where initiates traveled to the \"Crystal Caves\" to harvest kyber crystals, which they would use to build their first lightsabers. Crystals were attuned to individual Jedi and lacked color. The Force spoke to each of the younglings through their crystals. To find their crystal, each initiate had to learn a lesson: courage, hope, patience, trust, confidence, and selflessness.\n\nAn Initiate who successfully completes \"fundamental training\" is given a second-class education and then undergoes Padawan training under the tutelage of Mentor (usually a Jedi Knight or Jedi Master). They are also called \"Apprentices\" and \"Padawan learners\". As a rite of passage and the final test before the trials to knighthood, Padawans must build their own lightsabers. In the Old Republic, Padawans usually wore a hair braid on the right side of their head which was removed with a lightsaber upon attaining knighthood. They also served as Commanders in the Clone Wars. The term \"padawan\" appears to originate in Sanskrit and can be understood as “learner,\" both in Sanskrit and by contemporary native speakers of Sanskrit-based languages.\n\nDisciplined and experienced, Jedi Knights become so only when they have completed \"the trials\" (final tests) and may continue to pursue a third-class education (see below) to obtain the equivalent of a habilitation or post-doctoral degree. As the most common rank, it is interchangeably referred to as \"Jedi\", \"Jedi Knight\" and \"Master Jedi\" (although the latter are honorifics used only by Younglings and Padawans when addressing Jedi Knights or above).\n\nThe five tests are usually known as \"Trial of Skill\", the \"Trial of Courage\", the \"Trial of the Flesh\", the \"Trial of Spirit\", and the \"Trial of Insight (or Knowledge)\". In \"Return of the Jedi\", Master Yoda gives his apprentice, Luke Skywalker, the trial of confronting Darth Vader for a second time so he might become a full-fledged Knight. Occasionally, performing an extraordinary (usually heroic) act can earn a Padawan learner Jedi status, such as when Obi-Wan Kenobi defeats the Sith Lord Darth Maul. By the time of the movies distinct \"battle classes\" were not necessary as the Republic had not seen war in over a thousand years, and the title of Knight was simply a rank once again.\n\nJedi Master is a term of respect used by beings who respect the Jedi. Regarded as among the most accomplished and recognized polymaths in the \"Star Wars\" galaxy. Upon completion of vocational or postgraduate education, a Jedi Knight becomes a Jedi Master after successfully training a Padawan learner to Knight status. Though this is the most common manner, there are other ways of attaining the rank.\n\nVarious careers, occupations, ranks and titles were available to all Jedi. Upon a Padawan's ascension to \"\"Knighthood\"-status\", a Jedi pursued higher education or vocational education and training in a field of expertise. Before the Great Jedi Purge, Knights would choose a career based on preference, personal talents and skills, and were given the opportunity to join the Order of the Guardian, the Order of the Consular, or Order of the Sentinel. In addition to their specialization, in times of war the High Council could demand that the members of the Order assume military ranks in order to defend the Republic.\n\nWithin the \"Star Wars\" universe, the Jedi are usually portrayed wearing simple robes and carrying specialized field gear for their missions. Their philosophical lifestyles mirror those of real-world religious vows and evangelical counsels, as their personal possessions are provided exclusively by the Jedi Order, and are only meant to allow self-sufficiency.\n\nThe most notable instrument wielded by a Jedi is the Lightsaber. Both Jedi and Sith use lightsabers, though the former regards one as a tool, the latter, a weapon. The Jedi's lightsabers emit cool colors, usually blue or green blades (sometimes yellow, or purple, as seen in the case of Mace Windu), while the Sith emit warm colors (red). Lightsabers can be of many different colors depending on the crystal fixture. Most Jedi use naturally formed crystals, whereas Sith tend to use synthetic crystals, which are usually red in color.\n\nEta-2 Actis Jedi Interceptors first appeared in \"Revenge of the Sith\". Delta-7B Aethersprite Jedi starfighters appear in \"Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones\" and \"Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith\". In \"Attack of the Clones\", Obi-Wan Kenobi travels via Jedi starfighter to Kamino to investigate the attempted assassination of Padmé Amidala; he also flies a Jedi starfighter to Geonosis in an attempt to track down the bounty hunter Jango Fett. Lacking a hyperdrive, the starfighter relies on an external sled to propel it through hyperspace. Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) fly updated Jedi starfighters (called Jedi Interceptors) in the opening sequence of \"Revenge of the Sith\". Later, Plo Koon (Matt Sloan) flies an \"Revenge of the Sith\"-era starfighter when he is shot down by clone troopers carrying out Emperor Palpatine's (Ian McDiarmid) Order 66.\n\nThe Jedi starfighter's triangular shape in \"Attack of the Clones\" stems from the shape of Imperial Star Destroyers in the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy. Industrial Light & Magic designer Doug Chiang identified the Jedi starfighter as one of the first designs that bridges the aesthetic between the prequel and original trilogies. Chiang noted that viewers' familiarity with the Star Destroyer's appearance and Imperial affiliation gives added symbolism to the Jedi craft's appearance and foreshadows the Empire's rise to power. The starfighter seen in \"Revenge of the Sith\" is a cross between the previous film's vessel and the Empire's TIE fighters from the original trilogy. Hasbro's expanding wings in the \"Attack of the Clones\" Jedi starfighter toy inspired the opening wings in the \"Revenge of the Sith\" vessel. The starfighter in the \"Revenge of the Sith\" is called a Jedi Interceptor Starfighter.\n\nThe Jedi Archives, known as The Great Library of Ossus or The Great Library of the Jedi, contained the galaxy's most priceless and ancient of texts sacred to Jedi scholars and archaeologists. Among these were Sith artifacts, considered by the Jedi Order to be the most dangerous artifacts in the galaxy, that were accessible only to those able to control the Dark Side of the Force.\n\nThe Jedi archives of the Jedi Temple in the movie \"Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones\" bear a startling resemblance to the Long Room of the Trinity College Library in Dublin. This resemblance resulted in controversy as permission had not been sought to use the building's likeness in the film. However, Lucasfilm denied that the Long Room was the basis for the Jedi archives, and officials from Trinity College Library decided not to take any legal action.\n\nThe Jedi academies were established to train Force-sensitive beings accepted into the Jedi Order in the ways of the Force. Overseen by the Council of First Knowledge, each academy was governed by an advisory Council appointed by their superiors on Coruscant. Mainstreaming the majority of teachings at the Temple, certain practices were permitted to vary from world to world. However, at all sanctioned academies, a group of Jedi Masters would instruct Initiates to the Order in the ways of the Force. The size of the school varied from world to world; the smallest consisted of a single clan of younglings, and the largest was the main academy housed within the Jedi Temple of Coruscant. Most academies had been established during the Old Sith Wars and were located in the Galactic Rim. Some were located on or near Force-wellsprings or places significant to the Order like crystal caves or nexuses of dark side energies that needed constant monitoring.\n\nIn addition to the traditional academies established by the Order, the Exploration Corps maintained several spacefaring mobile academies such as the \"Chu'unthor\" so that roaming the galaxy and exploring new worlds could be achieved while still teaching traditional doctrine.\n\nBy the fall of the Galactic Republic in 19 BBY, many of the ancient academies had been shut down for decades, with the Council of First Knowledge preferring the central teachings of the Coruscant Temple. After the dissolution of the Order during the Great Jedi Purge, all orthodox Temples and academies were routed and burned in order to prevent any more Jedi from learning the secrets of the Force. However, the Galactic Empire's chokehold on Force-education did not last and the Order was reformed following the conclusion of the Galactic Civil War. When Grand Master Luke Skywalker's New Order became a single class of twelve students including his nephew Ben Solo, however it was reduced to only himself when his nephew turned to the darkside and became Kylo Ren.\n\nIn the \"Star Wars\" prequel trilogy saga, the Jedi Temple is located on the capital planet of Coruscant. As the chief administrative headquarters, the Temple served the Order in three capacities: a monastery and library for the Jedi seeking enlightenment and to reflect on the will of the Force; an academy and training center for Jedi younglings and Padawans who endeavored to join the ranks of the Jedi Knights; and government, in which the Masters of the Jedi High Council guided the Order's direction. It was originally built atop an old \"dark-side nexus\" shrine during the birth of the Republic, so as to be symbolic to the Coruscant people that the tyrannical rule of the Sith was over.\n\nIn \"Revenge of the Sith\", the Jedi Temple is attacked by clone troopers of the 501st Legion, led by the newly christened Darth Vader, who butchered the Jedi within and set the Temple alight. After the fall of the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic, the Temple became the Palace of the Emperor and a location for his dark side artifacts. It would serve as Sidious' residence for over two decades until his death at the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY. The Temple is visible in the celebrations on Coruscant at the end of \"Return of the Jedi\". After the destruction of the Sith, Luke Skywalker—the last of the Jedi—recovered fragments of a Force-sensitive tree that was once located at the heart of the Jedi Temple.\n\n\"Architects' Journal\" rated the temple third on its top-ten architecture of \"Star Wars\" list behind the second Death Star and Jabba the Hutt’s palace on Tatooine, and ahead of Coruscant, the capital city of the Old Republic. The temple is described in the article as adapting \"the robust typology of Mayan temples, with durasteel cladding specified for the external stone walls for improved defensive strength\" and said to be a ziggurat that \"is built above a Force-nexus and has ample room for training facilities, accommodation and the Jedi Archive.\" The temple has five towers, the tallest is Tranquility Spire, that are stylistically similar to the minarets surrounding the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul. \"Star Wars Insider\" listed it as the one hundredth greatest thing about Star Wars in its one hundredth issue special.\n\nNot every \"Dark Side\"-user is a Sith; nor is every \"Light Side\"-user a Jedi. Within the \"Star Wars\" Expanded Universe, people of all species have demonstrated varying \"force-sensitive\" powers and abilities. These \"force-wielders\" are often depicted with little to no formal Jedi training in the Force and originating from primitive planets.\n\nDark Side Adept is an official term, used to describe someone with the power to use the dark side of the Force outside of the traditions of the Jedi or the Sith. They were often steeped in the lore of the dark side and opposed to those who used the light side, such as Jedi. While all Sith were technically \"Dark Side Adepts\", the term was not exclusive to them, as non-Sith individuals such as Asajj Ventress, Kylo Ren, and the Grand Inquisitor were considered Dark Side Adepts. Dark Side Adepts were referenced in passing in James Luceno's canon novel \"Tarkin\".\n\nBendu debuted in the Star Wars Rebels season 3 episode, \"Steps Into Shadow\". Bendu was a Force-sensitive individual who resided on the remote planet of Atollon and represented the \"center\" of the Force, between the light side and the dark side. \"Jedi and Sith wield the \"Ashla\" and \"Bogan\". The light and the dark. I'm the one in the middle. The Bendu...\" stated Bendu. He is depicted as one who seeks balance, and has been likened to Tom Bombadil of \"The Lord of the Rings.\" The term \"Bendu\" first appears in the original script for Star Wars as the name of the Jedi Knights, the \"Jedi-Bendu\".\n\nMost notably, Anakin Skywalker's padawan Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, and continued to wield the Force, she never affiliated or created any Force sensitive organization.\n\nWith the 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company, most of the licensed \"Star Wars\" novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film \"Star Wars\" were rebranded as \"Star Wars Legends\" and declared non-canon to the franchise in April 2014.\n\nThe Je'daii Order, precursors to the modern Jedi, studied and used both the light and dark sides of the Force equally. The preview issue of \"Dawn of the Jedi\" states that the Je'daii originated ten thousand years before the saga takes place (approximately 46,453 years BBY). They were more monk than warrior, and their capital was Tython in the Deep Core\n\nIn novels set after the events of the film series, Luke Skywalker re-established the Jedi High Council as part of his New Jedi Order. The most notable difference between the format of the new council and the old is that only half of the council are made up of Jedi, while the other half consisted of politicians. Following the Yuuzhan Vong War, the Jedi withdrew their support from any one political entity and relocated to Ossus, where Luke had a full Jedi Council re-established.\n\nIn novels set after the events of the \"original\"-trilogy film series, The New Jedi Order was the restored and reformed Jedi organization, in the wake of the Great Jedi Purge and subsequent fall of the Galactic Empire. The Jedi Knights, reduced in number to only a handful, were slowly restored, primarily under the leadership of Grandmaster Luke Skywalker. Luke Skywalker abolished the traditional Master/Padawan system. He believed all Jedi should be both teachers and students; that they should both learn from and mentor each other, and not just from one Master.\n\nWithin the Expanded Universe, \"The New Jedi Order\" indicates that the Jedi Temple on Coruscant is no longer standing but it is rebuilt as a gift to Jedi for their services and achievements during the Yuuzhan Vong invasion. The new temple is in the form of a massive pyramid made from stone and transparisteel that is designed to fit into the new look of Coruscant, though internally it is identical to the design seen in \"Revenge of the Sith\".\n\nThe United States Army had a group of officers in the early 1980s who promoted maneuver warfare tactics, and who were derisively referred to as Jedi by more conventional officers who were satisfied with attrition tactics and methods.\n\nIn \"Star Wars and Philosophy\", William Stephens compares the Jedi to Stoicism\n\nJedi have made their way into certain areas of pop culture, such as \"Weird Al\" Yankovic's song \"The Saga Begins\", a parody of \"American Pie\". In the film \"The Men Who Stare at Goats\" (2009), a reporter follows a former soldier who claimed to be a \"Jedi warrior\", a nickname for psychic spies in the US military.\n\nOne of the enduring influences the \"Star Wars\" saga has had in popular culture is the idea of the fictional Jedi values being interpreted as a modern philosophical path or religion, spawning various movements such as the Jediism (religious) and the Jedi census phenomenon.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4715253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4715253", "title": "Land contract", "text": "Land contract\n\nA land contract — often described by other terminology listed below — is a contract between the buyer and seller of real property in which the seller provides the buyer financing in the purchase, and the buyer repays the resulting loan in installments. Under a land contract, the seller retains the legal title to the property, while permitting the buyer to take possession of it for most purposes other than legal ownership. The sale price is typically paid in periodic installments, often with a balloon payment at the end to make the timelength of payments shorter than in the corresponding fully amortized loan (i.e., a loan without a final balloon payment). When the full purchase price has been paid including any interest, the seller is obligated to convey (to the buyer) legal title to the property. An initial down payment from the buyer to the seller is usually also required. \n\nThe legal status of land contracts varies between jurisdictions.\n\nSince a land contract specifies the sale of a specific item of real estate between a seller and buyer, a land contract can be considered a special type of real estate contract. In the usual, more conventional real estate contracts, a seller does not provide a loan to the buyer; the contract either does not specify a loan or includes provisions for a loan from a different \"third party\" lender, usually a financial institution in practice. When third party lenders are involved, typically a lien, as part of a mortgage or trust deed, is placed on the property, in which the property serves as collateral until the loan is repaid.\n\nOther terms for a land contract include:\n\nIt is common for the installment payments of the purchase price to be similar to mortgage payments in amount and effect. The amount is often determined according to a mortgage amortization schedule. In effect, each installment payment is partial payment of the purchase price and partial payment of interest on the unpaid purchase price. This is similar to mortgage payments which are part repayment of the principal amount of the mortgage loan and part interest. As the buyer pays more toward the principal of the loan over time, his(her) equity (equitable title or equitable interest) in the property increases. For example, if a buyer pays a $2000 down payment and borrows $8000 for a $10000 parcel of land, and pays off in installments another $4000 of this loan (not including interest), the buyer has $6000 of equity in the land (which is 60% of the equitable title), but the seller holds legal title to the land as recorded in documentation (deeds) in a government recorder's office until the loan is completely paid off. However, if the buyer defaults on installment payments, the land contract may consider the failure to timely pay installments a breach of contract and the land equity may revert to the seller, depending on the land contract provisions.\n\nSince land contracts can easily be written or modified by any seller or buyer; one may come across any variety of repayment plans. Interest only, negative amortizations, short balloons, extremely long amortizations just to name a few. It is not uncommon for land contracts to go unrecorded. For several reasons, the buyer or seller may decide that the contract is not to be recorded in the register of deeds. This does not make the contract invalid, but it does increase exposure to undesirable side effects. Some states, such as Minnesota, issue contracts without an acceleration clause, which in the case of a default leaves the seller in a position to either cancel the contract, discharging any principal deficiency, as in the case of deprecation, or to litigate for 18 months or more while letting the buyer, if not a corporation, retain their rights to the property while collection attempts are made, by which time the buyer will often qualify for bankruptcy, making the contract, when lacking said acceleration clause, effectively an installment option, when the buyer has no other lienable assets. In bankruptcy, some regions will interpret it as an executory contract that can be rejected, while others will treat it as a debt to be paid out of the bankruptcy trust. This and a wide variety of other legal ambiguities has led to a trend toward eliminating the use of Land Contracts to remove any incentives, and as a result, the disadvantages that these contracts have compared to the standard note and mortgage, which are more clearly defined in, and regulated by, law. \n\nAlthough most land contracts can be used for a variety of reasons, their most common use is as a form of short-term seller financing. Usually, but not always, the date on which the full amount of the purchase price is due will be years sooner than when the purchase price would be paid in full according to the amortization schedule. This results in the final payment being a large balloon payment. Since the amount of the final payment is so large, the buyer may obtain a conventional mortgage loan from a bank to make the final payment. Land contracts are sometimes used by buyers who do not qualify for conventional mortgage loans offered by a traditional lending institution, for reasons of unestablished or poor credit or an insufficient down payment. Land contracts are also used when the seller is eager to sell and the buyer is not given enough time to arrange for conventional financing.\n\nThere can be other advantages of using a land contract too. When a third-party lender, such as a financial institution, provides a loan, this third party has its own interests to protect against the other two parties involved, the seller and buyer. Establishing the correct title and value of the property to be used as collateral is important to the lender. Thus, the lender commonly requires title service including title search and title insurance by an independent title company, appraisal and termite inspection of the property to ensure it has sufficient value, a land survey to ensure there are no encroachments, and use of lawyers to ensure the closing is done correctly. These third party lender requirements add to closing costs which the lender requires the seller and/or buyer to pay. If the seller is also the lender, these costs are usually not required by the seller and may result in closing cost savings and fewer complications. It may also be the seller's position that if the buyer requires any of these services, he could pay for the costs and make arrangements himself. For properties where only relatively undeveloped land is involved and if the seller is willing to finance, the price of the empty land may be so low that the conventional closing costs are not worthwhile and can be an impediment to a quick, simple sale. Easy financing and a simple sale transaction may be a good selling point for a seller to offer a buyer.\n\nA land contract is a unilateral contract and cannot be assigned to another buyer without the consent of the seller providing the financing.\n\nBecause of growing concerns that sales via land contract might violate truth in lending laws, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is considering regulating these real estate sales. In 2015, Texas law was changed to automatically place the legal title to the property with the buyer by filing the contract with the deed records office of the county where the property is located. While the seller loses title, the seller retains a vendor's lien in the property for the outstanding balance of the contract.\n\n\n"}

The agency was created in 2002.\n\nThe mission of MIVILUDES involves analysing \"the phenomenon of movements with a cultic character whose actions affront the rights of man and fundamental liberties, or which constitute a threat to public order or which are contrary to the laws and regulations\".\n\nMIVILUDES provides information related to \"cultic deviances\" to the media, the French government, and individual members of the public. It recommends contacts and other organizations, and produces and archives documentation and discussion papers on groups considered cults.\n\nThe French authorities created MIVILUDES as the successor to MILS (\"Mission interministérielle de lutte contre les sectes\"; English: \"Interministerial Mission in the Fight Against Cults\"), which itself functioned from 7 October 1998 as the successor to the \"Observatoire interministériel sur les sectes\" established on 9 May 1996. These organisations were in charge of co-ordinating government monitoring of cults. \n\nIn February 1998, MILS, headed by Alain Vivien, released its annual report on their monitoring of cults in France. The operations of MILS, and Alain Vivien's background as the head of an anti-cult organization (he had served as President of the Centre Roger Ikor from 1997 to 1998), had occasionally received criticism from several human-rights organizations, such as the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights, as well as the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, a US government agency. (See also About-Picard law#Reactions). In January 1999 Vivien requested and received police protection following threats and the burglary of his home. Vivien resigned in June 2002 under criticism.\n\nMIVILUDES was created by a presidential decree on 28 November 2002. Jean-Louis Langlais, a senior civil-servant at the Ministry of the Interior, served as its president from 2002 to 2005.\nAnnouncing the formation of MIVILUDES, the French government acknowledged the criticism that MILS had received from outside France for certain activities that could be considered in violation of religious freedom. The decree establishing MIVILUDES\nreferred to MILS only indirectly in announcing the abrogation (in Article 8) of the decree establishing MILS. \n\nIn an interview in March 2003, Langlais categorised the fight as not against \"sects\", but against \"sectarian deviances\". He stated that current French law lacks a definition for a \"sect\" and, therefore \"the law cannot define sectarian deviances\". Nevertheless, he portrayed the role of MIVILUDES as contributing to \"defining what could simply be an administrative jurisprudence\".\n\nA 2004 report by the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom concluded with an assessment that the restructuring of the main French agency concerned with this issue — referring to MILS being replaced by MIVILUDES — had improved religious freedoms in France.\n\nJean-Michel Roulet became president of MIVILUDES in October 2005, followed by Georges Fenech in 2008.\n\n\n"}

Rajagopalachari (Rajaji) in 1953. The scheme proposed the introduction of two shifts or sessions in elementary schools. In one session regular teaching would be done and during the second session, the students would be sent home to learn the occupations of their parents. It became controversial and was accused of being a casteist scheme to perpetuate the caste hierarchy as Hindu Professions were caste based. Public opposition and internal dissent within the congress led to the deferment of the scheme. The discontent it triggered among the Congress legislature members forced the resignation of Rajaji as Chief Minister. The scheme was dropped completely by Rajaji's successor Kamaraj in 1954.\n\nAccording to the 1951 Census of India, the literacy rate in the Madras State was 20.86%. During fiscal year 1950-51, the Madras State Government spent 6.87 crore Rupees (6,870,000) - about 11.5% of total revenues for the state - for Elementary education. The enrollment rate for children of school-going age was around 47.8%. The Directive Principles of the Indian Constitution require the Indian state to provide education to all citizens. In accordance to this directive, in 1950 the Madras State's Directorate of Public Instruction prepared a ten-year plan to provide education to all children of school-going age. This plan called for an allocation of one crore Rs (1,00,00,000) per year for enrolling 500,000 additional students for the next ten years. Against this, the actual allocation in 1950-51 was only Rs. 500,000. The cost of educating a student was estimated to be around Rs.22.80 per year, out of which the government's contribution was Rs.16.30. Out of the 12,22,775 students who had enrolled in standard I in 1946-47, only 4,61,686 (37%) had reached the Standard V in 1950-51. It was against this background, the Congress party with Rajaji as chief minister took power on 10 April 1952.\n\nThe opposition to the scheme was largely based on social background. Hindu professions are based on Varna or Caste with the Brahmins the highest in the order and studied while Kshatriya and Vaishya traders received some education. Shudra were denied education. Dalits were considered untouchables and did manual work and also denied education. When the Justice Party came to power in 1920, Brahmins disproportionately occupied over 70% of the high level posts in government, judiciary and in education. The Justice Party introduced caste based reservation and this gradually reversed this trend and allowed non-Brahmins to rise in the government and education in Madras Presidency. The first generation of Dalits, Scheduled Castes and Tribes and Backward Classes also started getting educated and their children had just begun to attend school after centuries of denial of educational opportunities under the rigid Hindu caste system. As per this policy schools were to work in the morning and students had to compulsorily learn the family vocation in the afternoon. This was seen as a ploy to ensure the domination and monopoly of Brahmins. The ulterior motive behind the scheme was understood to be that the children of non-Brahmins should undertake only the manual jobs of their ancestors such as washerman, barber, scavenger, cobbler etc. and they should not aspire for any higher education or for any white collar employment, which only Brahmins could claim as their exclusive privilege. They should follow their parents' professions and remain in their low status and lowly paid professions. Such a step would maintain caste hegemony.\n\nIn 1939, during Rajaji's first term as Chief Minister of the Madras Presidency, the girl students of standards III to V and those belonging to Scheduled Castes had been allowed to attend school for only three hours a day and spend the rest of the day helping their parents. In the academic year 1949-50, during the Chief ministership of P. S. Kumaraswamy Raja, an experimental shift system had been introduced in ten taluks and later expanded to other areas as an optional measure. Schools which adapted this system functioned in two shifts or sessions. Teachers who worked during both sessions were paid an additional allowance of 10 Rupees per month. However this system was not widely adopted and by 1951 only 155 elementary schools (out of a total 38,687) in the state were functioning in shifts.\n\n\nThe Modified Scheme of Elementary education proposed the following changes in the school system:\n\n\nThe Rajaji Government introduced the new elementary education scheme in all schools in the non-municipal (rural) areas for the academic year 1953-54 (from 18 June 1953). It was planned that eventually the scheme would be extended to 35,000 of the total 38,687 schools in the state. However, due to public opposition, it was put on hold on 29 July 1953 and dropped altogether on 18 May 1954.\n\nFrom the beginning, the scheme attracted heavy opposition from the Dravidian movement led by Periyar E. V. Ramasamy. The Dravidar Kazhagam organised a conference in Erode protesting the scheme's introduction. The teachers' unions also opposed their move as they were not consulted before implementation. They also resented the increase in working hours without any increase in pay. The DMK seized the opportunity and started a campaign against the scheme. They dubbed the scheme as the \"Kula kalvi thittam\" (Hereditary/Caste Education Scheme) and as the \"Acharyar Education Scheme\". The Dravidian movement viewed the scheme as an attempt to preserve and perpetuate caste based discrimination through official means. They used Rajaji's notions about caste and village craftsmen to depict the scheme as a \"Brahminist conspiracy\". Rajaji had earlier expressed his opinion about castes and crafts as:\n\nAfter the scheme was announced, Rajaji gave a speech to the washermen at the Adyar riverbank. In it he referred to \"Kuladharma\", the social obligation of each clan or caste. The opposition used such incidents to lend credence to their \"casteist motive\" accusation. Rajaji and his education minister MV Krishna Rao responded with a counter campaign in the scheme's defense. They gave speeches and made broadcasts in the All India Radio explaining their position. The month of June 1953 saw aggressive propaganda efforts by both the proponents and opponents of the scheme. On 13 July 1953, the DMK executive committee met and decided to conduct a \"marial\" (blockade) agitation outside the Chief Minister's residence. EVK Sampath was nominated to lead the agitation. This agitation was part of a three pronged attack on the Government's policies by the DMK. On 14 July 1953, a possession led by Satyavani Muthu was organised to protest the scheme. Its destination was Rajaji's official residence at Bazullah road, T. Nagar. It was stopped by the police as it was unlicensed. The next day (15 July 1953) the confrontation heated up with the Government introducing a motion in the Legislative Assembly for implementing the scheme from the academic year 1953-54. On the same day another DMK procession was stopped before it could reach T Nagar. In the next fifteen days as many as twenty such processions were attempted by the DMK.\n\nBy the end of July, public opinion started to turn against the scheme and at least four public petitions were tabled in the Legislative Assembly about the scheme. On 29 July 1953, M.V Krishna Rao, the minister for education moved a motion for considering the new scheme. After a discussion, Communist leader K. P Gopalan moved a motion to drop the scheme. The house was deadlocked with 138 ayes to 138 noes on dropping the scheme. The speaker of the assembly J. Shivashanmugam Pillai used his casting vote to defeat the motion. A second motion to defer the scheme and refer it to a committee of experts was moved by K.R Viswanatham. This motion passed with 138 ayes against 137 noes. The Scheme was stayed and the Parulekar Committee was commissioned to review the scheme.\n\nOn 20 August 1953, the Government passed an order (Education G.O # 1888) to constitute a committee of experts for reviewing the scheme. The committee was composed of Prof. RV. Parulekar, Director of Indian Institute of Education Bombay, as the Chairman; Dr.B.B. Dey, Retired Director of Public Instruction, Madras; Prof. Mohammad Mujeeb, Vice-Chancellor of the Jamia Millia University as members and S. Govindarajulu Naidu, the former Director of Public Instruction, Madras, and the then Director of Public Instruction, Andhra Pradesh, as the Member Secretary. The Parulekar committee submitted its report on 23 November 1953. It found the scheme to be sound and endorsed the Government's position. It made additional recommendations including extending the scheme to rural areas, opening as many as 4000 new schools, revising the existing curriculum, providing training and remuneration to the craftsmen involved.\n\nThe opposition campaign was successful in creating doubts about the scheme in the minds of the general public. There was dissent within the Congress party and Kamaraj wanted Rajaji to withdraw the scheme as it was unpopular amongst the public and with the party members. On 20 October 1953, forty Congress Legislative Assembly members led by P. Varadarajulu Naidu, sent a memorandum to Nehru objecting to Rajaji's unilateral conduct. Among the issues they raised was his refusal to budge on the education scheme issue. But Rajaji refused to drop the scheme. On 8 November 1953, Congress lost the by election for the Kangayam constituency by a narrow margin. Pressure mounted from within the party to drop the scheme. On 9 March 1954, Congress leader and former Chief Minister O. P. Ramaswamy Reddiyar made an open appeal to Rajaji in the legislature:\n\nBut Rajaji did not relent and his education minister C Subramaniam upped the ante by announcing that the scheme would be extended to urban areas in June 1954. This spurred the Congress legislators into open revolt. They scheduled a meeting of the Congress Legislative Party on 21 March. Faced with certain defeat in the leadership election that was bound to happen in that meeting, Rajaji tried a last minute compromise - he would quit if C. Subramaniam was chosen as his successor and the scheme was kept. But Kamaraj, the leader of the anti-Rajaji camp, refused to accept the deal. The meeting was postponed by a week and when it happened on March 31, C. Subramaniam was defeated by Kamaraj. Rajaji resigned and Kamaraj took over as chief minister on 13 April 1954. This effectively ended the prospects of the new education scheme. On 18 May 1954, C Subramaniam announced in the assembly that the scheme was being dropped. The reason stated for the dropping was \"that the necessary acceptance, support and cooperation of the people were not forthcoming for the scheme and the atmosphere was not propitious for the success of the scheme\".\n\nMeanwhile, the composite Madras State had been reorganised along linguistic lines. The state of Andhra had split from Madras on 1 October 1953. The Andhra Government constituted an Elementary Education Committee with Dr. B. Kuppuswamy as chairman to review the elementary education situation. The Kuppuswamy committee report recommended the rejection of the Modified Elementary Education Scheme. In 1954 the Andhra state cancelled the scheme.\n\nThe main arguments made against the Modified Scheme of Elementary Education were :\n\nWriting in \"Viduthalai\" on 17 November 1953, Periyar denounced the scheme as a Brahiminical conspiracy:\n\nIn another \"Viduthalai\" article written on 26 February 1954, he vowed to destroy the scheme by any means:\n\nHe kept up his harangue even after Rajaji resigned and C Subramaniam became the new Education minister. On 17 April 1954 he wrote:\n\nThe Andhra Elementary Education Committee Report also rejected the Modified Scheme and recommended an approach similar to the one eventually adopted by the Kamaraj Government.\n\nDuring and after his tenure as Chief Minister, Rajaji defended his scheme vigorously. He derided the critics as people who did not want to do physical labour:\n\nAbout the casteist angle of the criticism, he reasoned that it was because of him being the author of the scheme:\n\nAfter the Kamaraj Government scrapped the scheme, he again defended it as :\n\nReplying to Papanasam MLA Swayam Prakasam's concerns over the scheme, then Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru offered his endorsement to the scheme:\n\nIndia's President Rajendra Prasad offered his support in a letter written to the Governor of Madras - Sri Prakasa - on 9 June 1953:\n\nThe Central Advisory Board of Education, passed a resolution endorsing the scheme during its 21st Meeting held in February 1954:\n\nThe Modified Scheme of Elementary Education even after being dropped had the unintended consequence of bringing primary education to hundreds of thousands of school children in Tamil Nadu. Rajaji's successor Kamaraj was ever mindful of the fact that it was the issue of primary education that caused his predecessor's downfall. Knowing the public opposition to Rajaji's scheme he took the diametrically opposite approach in providing education to Tamil Nadu's children - imparting free and compulsory education till the age of 14. He set up a commission under R.M. Alagappa Chettiar to examine the means for providing compulsory primary education. Instead of sending children away from the school, the committee recommended active Government intervention to bring more children into the schooling system by building new schools and abolishing school fees. This approach was successful and by the end of Kamaraj's tenure as Chief Minister in 1963, enrollment in primary schools had been doubled.\n\n"}
{"id": "38580553", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38580553", "title": "Mozart's nationality", "text": "Mozart's nationality\n\nThis article discusses the nationality of the composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756–1791).\n\nThe two main labels that have been used to describe Mozart's nationality are \"Austrian\" and \"German\". However, in Mozart's own time, these terms were used differently from the way they are used today, because the modern nation states of Austria and Germany did not yet exist. Any decision to label Mozart as \"Austrian\" or \"German\" (or neither) involves political boundaries, history, language, culture, and Mozart's own views. Editors of modern encyclopedias and other reference sources differ in how they assign a label to Mozart (if any) in light of conflicting criteria.\n\nMozart was born in Salzburg, the capital of a small, essentially sovereign state called the Archbishopric of Salzburg. Thus in one sense Mozart's nationality could be said to be \"Salzburgian\", though English-language biographers do not generally use this term to designate his nationality.\n\nThe Archbishopric of Salzburg was but one of more than 300 similarly independent states in the part of Europe that was populated by German speakers. Most of these states, Salzburg included, were included in a larger political entity, the Holy Roman Empire. The Holy Roman Empire was German in various ways: most of its population was German-speaking, its official full name was the \"Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation\" (German: \"Heiliges Römisches Reich Deutscher Nation\"), it conducted most of its business in German, and one of the titles held by its emperor was \"King in Germany.\" Beales adds, \"[the emperor] and the Empire were foci of German patriotism. Even in Hamburg, Protestant and remote from his court [in Vienna], prayers were regularly said for him and his birthday was celebrated.\"\n\nHowever, although the Holy Roman Empire was largely German, it was hardly a nation state, but only a very loose confederation, the feeble residue of an empire that had been robust centuries earlier. According to the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\", the princes whose states comprised the empire \"legislated at will, levied taxes, concluded alliances, and waged wars against each other ... The imperial Diet meeting in Regensburg had degenerated into a debating society without authority or influence. The splendid [imperial] coronation ceremony in Frankfurt am Main could not disguise the fact that the office conferred on its holder little more than prestige.\"\n\nThus, although the phrase \"Mozart was German\" can be given a \"cultural\" interpretation (see below), it cannot be taken to mean that Mozart was a citizen of Germany. During his time, there was no German nation-state that he could have been a citizen of.\n\nAccording to Beales (2006a, 30–31), in Mozart's time the word \"Austria\" (German: \"Österreich\") had several meanings.\n\nThe original Austria was the Archduchy of Austria, a rather small state centered around Vienna, roughly coextensive with the modern Austrian states of Upper Austria and Lower Austria. Starting in 1282 this core area was ruled by the Habsburg dynasty. Over the centuries, the Habsburgs accreted ever more lands to their holdings, both inside and outside the Holy Roman Empire, and both German and non-German speaking. Despite this expansion, the Habsburg dynasty retained an Austrian identity, maintaining their capital in Vienna and referring to their aggregated lands as \"the Austrian Monarchy\". The word \"Austria\" was sometimes used as an informal cover term for all of the lands ruled by the Habsburgs.\nThe power of the Habsburgs was such that they came to dominate the emperorship of the Holy Roman Empire: starting in 1452, the \"Electors\" (the handful of princes who held the right to elect the next emperor) virtually always chose the Habsburg monarch for the emperorship whenever the office became vacant. The emperors who served in Mozart's time were Francis I, Joseph II, and Leopold II. Of these, the latter two were Habsburg descendants; Francis I was the husband of the Habsburg ruler Maria Theresa, who held the emperorship on her behalf since as a woman she could not legally serve.\n\nFor administrative purposes, the Holy Roman Empire was divided into \"circles\". The Austrian Circle included the original Archduchy of Austria, as well as a number of other areas now part of modern Austria. Salzburg was not included; it was part of the Bavarian Circle.\n\nIn sum, \"Austria\" in Mozart's time could mean (in increasing order of size), the Archduchy of Austria, the Austrian Circle, and the Habsburg-ruled lands. None of these included Salzburg.\n\nAlthough Mozart was not born in Austria (as then defined), he had close connections there. He made three extended visits to Vienna in his youth, and in 1781 moved to Vienna to pursue his career; he remained there to the end of his life (1791).\n\nThe map below (click twice to enlarge) portrays the Holy Roman Empire as of 1789, surrounded by a red dashed line. The Prince-Archbishopric of Salzburg, shaped somewhat like a thick inverted capital T, is shown in lavender in the southern portion of the map, sandwiched between the extensive Habsburg territories (shown in orange-brown) and Bavaria (pale green). The great number of small independent states that are now mostly part of Germany can also be seen. The extensive territories ruled by the Habsburgs but outside of the Holy Roman Empire are not indicated on the map.\n\nFor maps depicting the Circles of the Holy Roman Empire, see Imperial Circle.\n\nThe political situation that prevailed in Mozart's lifetime did not long endure, with radical changes resulting from the Napoleonic Wars. Holy Roman Emperor Francis II first decreed (1804) a new Austrian Empire, consisting solely of the lands ruled directly by the Habsburgs. Two years later (1806), he allowed the Holy Roman Empire to lapse, ending its centuries-long existence.\nThe wars also had drastic consequences for Salzburg. In 1800 it was occupied by Napoleon's troops; the reigning prince-archbishop Hieronymus von Colloredo (Mozart's old employer) had to flee. He never again exercised political rule, though he retained his ecclesiastical title. In the negotiated settlements that followed, Salzburg was first made into an independent secular state (the Electorate of Salzburg, 1803), then unified with the Austrian Empire (1805), then awarded to Bavaria (1809), and finally returned again to the Austrian Empire (1816).\n\nThe Austrian Empire underwent further political evolution, ultimately disintegrating in 1918 at the end of the First World War, at which time the small residual nation of Austria—including the old territory of Salzburg—was created.\n\nAs noted above, there was no country called \"Germany\" in Mozart's day; rather, there were hundreds of independent or quasi-independent German-speaking states. Of these, Prussia (blue on the map) was already on the rise, expanding its territory, and it was under Prussian leadership that Germany was ultimately unified in 1871. It was only as of that year that one could speak of a German nation-state.\n\nHowever, the word \"German\" (in German: \"deutsch\") was in use well before this time, designating the people of central Europe who shared German language and culture. To give an example, when in 1801 Mozart's old colleague Emanuel Schikaneder opened the Theater an der Wien in Vienna, a Leipzig music journal praised the new theater as \"the \"most comfortable and satisfactory in the whole of Germany\". The city of Salzburg, owing to its fine ecclesiastical architecture, was sometimes called \"the German Rome\".\n\nMozart himself used the word \"German\" in this sense, and apparently felt a sense of national or ethnic pride in being German. The following passage, from a letter to his father Leopold, attests to this:\n\nA series of similar recorded utterances from Mozart is given by Kerst (1906). From this evidence, it is clear that Mozart considered himself to be German. However, for the reasons just given, the relevant sense is necessarily a linguistic or cultural one, there being no country of \"Germany\" of which Mozart could have been a citizen. Roselli (1998, 10) asserts that \"Mozart was born into a part of Europe where nationality in the modern sense did not exist.\"\n\nAs can be seen, evidence is available to support a variety of opinions about Mozart's nationality. Thus, he was Austrian because the town in which he was born and raised is now in Austria, and because he made his career in Vienna, the Austrian capital. He was German because he felt himself to be German, and because the residual and moribund empire that included Salzburg was labeled as and felt to be German. He was neither Austrian nor German because Salzburg was independent, neither part of the Habsburg Austrian possessions nor part of a (yet to exist) German nation-state.\n\nThe scholars who prepare biographies and reference works have made varying choices in assigning Mozart a nationality.\n\nThe widely consulted \"Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians\" calls Mozart an Austrian composer, as do the \"Houghton Mifflin Dictionary of Biography\" (2003), the \"Oxford Concise Dictionary of Music\" (Bourne and Kennedy 2004) and the \"NPR Listener's Encyclopedia of Classical Music\" (Libbey 2006). The practice of the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" is split: the brief anonymous summary (\"Micropedia\") article calls him Austrian, but the main article (\"Macropedia\"), written by H. C. Robbins Landon, makes no mention of a nationality.\n\nSources describing Mozart as German are more abundant in earlier work, particularly before the founding of the modern nation-state of Austria in 1918. A London newspaper, reporting the composer's death in 1791, referred to him as \"the celebrated German composer\". In Lieber et al. (1832, 78), Mozart is introduced as \"the great German composer\"; Ferris (1891) included Mozart in a book called \"The Great German Composers\". Other descriptions of Mozart as German appear in Kerst (1906, 3), Mathews and Liebling (1896), and MacKey and Haywood (1909); also (much later) Hermand and Steakley (1981).\n\nSources sometimes have changed their practice over time. The Grove dictionary did not always call Mozart \"Austrian\"; the designation appears to have added with the first edition of the \"New Grove\" in 1980. Similarly, \"Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians\" did not originally offer a nationality but added the word \"Austrian\" to its opening sentence for the 8th edition (1992) and has retained it since. The \"Encyclopædia Britannica\", now an \"Austrian\" source, long ago listed Mozart as a German composer.\n\nPeter Branscombe's brief biography (2006, 304) begins with the description \"composer and keyboard player\"—in an encyclopedia that otherwise always specifies the nationality of composers, suggesting the omission of nationality may have been deliberate. Other authors who say nothing about Mozart's nationality (whether deliberately or not) are Hermann Abert, Maynard Solomon, and Robbins Landon, mentioned above; and among encyclopedias the \"Riemann Musik Lexicon\" (1961), and the \"International Cyclopedia of Music and Musicians\" (1985). The prestigious German music encyclopedia \"Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart\" lists no nationality, but this follows the policy it applies to all composers.\n\nSome sources mention both nationalities: the \"Brockhaus Riemann Musik Lexikon\" (1975) begins its article \"composer, on the father's side of Augsburg-south German ancestry; on the mother's side Salzburg-Austrian\". Julian Rushton, in his Mozart biography, summarizes many of the facts given above and concludes: \"Mozart, by modern criteria Austrian, counted himself a German composer.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1691859", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1691859", "title": "No-fault divorce", "text": "No-fault divorce\n\nNo-fault divorce is a divorce in which the dissolution of a marriage does not require a showing of wrongdoing by either party. Laws providing for no-fault divorce allow a family court to grant a divorce in response to a petition by either party of the marriage without requiring the petitioner to provide evidence that the defendant has committed a breach of the marital contract.\n\nThe first modern no-fault divorce law was enacted in Russia in December 1917 following the October Revolution of the same year. Regarding marriage as a bourgeois institution, the new government transferred divorce jurisdiction from the Russian Orthodox Church to the state courts, which could grant it on application of either spouse. A new family code was passed in 1926.\n\nWith a law adopted in 1969, California became the first U.S. state to permit no-fault divorce. California's law was framed on a roughly contemporaneous effort of the non-governmental organization National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, which began drafting a model of no-fault divorce statute for states to consider in 1967.\n\nAustralia established no-fault divorce in 1975, with the only ground for divorce being irretrievable breakdown of marriage, evidenced by a twelve-month separation. Canada effectively permitted no-fault divorce in 1986 by reducing the separation period to one year.\n\nSeveral studies have looked at the effect of no-fault divorce on divorce rates in the United States. The studies typically find an increase in the short-term rate, but little long-term causal relationship. The most frequent explanation given is that the older laws were ineffective and not followed anyway, though there are some differing viewpoints. Economists Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers, based on findings in their research, argue that domestic violence and female suicide decline in states that legalize no-fault divorce. Specifically, they report that \"states that adopted no-fault divorce experienced a decrease of 8 to 16 percent in wives' suicide rates and a 30 percent decline in domestic violence.\" They also argue that their research proves that there is no permanent effect of no-fault divorce laws on divorce rates.\n\nStephanie Coontz, a professor of history at Evergreen State College, states that \"in the years since no-fault divorce became well-nigh universal, the national divorce rate has fallen, from about 23 divorces per 1,000 married couples in 1979 to under 17 per 1,000 in 2005.\" She adds that \"once you permit the courts to determine when a person's desire to leave is legitimate, you open the way to arbitrary decisions about what is or should be tolerable in a relationship, made by people who have no stake in the actual lives being lived.\"\n\nA 2010 \"New York Times\" editorial said that New York was \"the only state where a court must find fault before granting a divorce unless the spouses have lived apart for a full year under a formal separation agreement — a proven formula for inviting false testimony, endless litigation and generally making divorce far more painful than it needs to be.\" Later that year, New York became the final state to allow no-fault divorce. Lawyer L.M. Fenton states that \"Feminist holdouts against New York's new [no-fault divorce] bill don't understand how family law affects women today\", adding: \"It also mystifies me that spouses could still, even in 2010, be forced to stay married to someone who refused to let go.\" She adds:\n\nFault-based grounds usually include mental cruelty, but true mental cruelty has a psychological component that can make it very difficult for the abused spouse to articulate that abuse. More to the point, the abused spouse may be terrified to describe the relationship on paper and testify about it in a court. And of course, a controlling partner will always choose the path of most resistance to whatever it is that the other spouse wants.\n\nThe state adopted no-fault divorce later that year.\n\nThe National Organization for Women opposed the introduction of no-fault divorce in New York State because it would allow a party who actually is at fault to obtain a divorce in which \"alimony, maintenance [and] property division\" would be determined without the judge considering \"the facts, behavior and circumstances that led to the break-up of the marriage\".\n\nA paper published in the \"Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy\", written by Douglas Allen, on the economics of same-sex marriage, argues that the introduction of no-fault divorce led to a six-fold increase in just two years, after a century of rather stable divorce rates. Also, the law increased the rate at which women entered the workforce, increased the number of hours worked in a week, increased the feminization of poverty, and increased the age at which people married.\n\nStephen Baskerville, a political scientist at Howard University, argues that no-fault divorce rewards wrongdoers, reduces the need of marital binding agreement contracts at the public's expense, and helps women take custody of their children at the husbands' expense in many cases where the man has done nothing wrong. He also adds that a ban on divorce will not work, because people will separate themselves and be in a permanent state of adultery, or they will create a hostile home environment for the children.\n\nAustralia's laws on divorce and other legal family matters were overhauled in 1975 with the enactment of the Family Law Act 1975, which established no-fault divorce in Australia. Since 1975, the only ground for divorce is irretrievable breakdown of marriage, evidenced by a twelve-month separation. However, a residual \"fault\" element remains in relation to child custody and property settlement issues.\n\nPrior to 1968, the only grounds for divorce were adultery or cruelty. However, in 1968, the Divorce Act was amended to permit divorce for other reasons, including physical and mental cruelty and separation for at least 3 years. The Divorce Act was amended in 1986 to reduce the separation period to one year, with no requirement to prove \"fault\" by either spouse. The fault grounds for divorce are also available.\n\nChina has allowed no-fault divorce since the adoption of the New Marriage Law in 1950. No-fault divorce has become much more common since the 1980s. The current marriage law provides that divorce shall always be granted if sought by both husband and wife. Divorce is also granted if one party can present evidence of incompatibility, such as separation for at least 2 years.\n\nDivorce may be granted either by court or by a marriage registration office. The latter can only do so when both parties have reached an agreement on child custody and property settlement.\n\nA Maltese law permitting no-fault divorce went into effect in October 2011, following a national referendum on the subject. This was the first Maltese law permitting any kind of divorce.\n\nIn Mexico City, this type of divorce is legally known as \"\" and colloquially as \"divorcio exprés\". The law was passed for the first time in Mexico City in 2008 and held constitutional by the Supreme Court, which in 2015 established that any state law requiring to prove the case for a divorce was unconstitutional.\n\nNo-fault divorce was introduced by the Bolsheviks following the Russian Revolution of 1917. Before the Revolution, religious institutions tended to define family life. It was the ecclesiastical law of the various denominations that controlled the family, marriage, and divorce. For example, the official registration of birth, death, marriage, and divorce was the responsibility of the parish church. Under these non-secular laws, divorce was highly restricted (but always somewhat available, as no major religion in Russia completely disallowed divorce).\n\nThe 1918 Decree on Divorce eliminated the religious marriage and the underlying ecclesiastical law, replacing them with civil marriage sanctioned by the state. Divorce was obtained by filing a mutual consent document with the Russian Registry Office, or by the unilateral request of one party to the court. The divorce law under the Bolsheviks did not penalize the husband with alimony, child support, or debtor's prison for non-payment, as every individual was to be provided for by the state anyway. The two partners were entirely free of legal obligations to each other after divorce.\n\nIn Spain, this type of divorce is legally known as \"\" or \"divorcio unilateral\" and colloquially as \"divorcio exprés\".\n\nSwedish law does not include a showing-of-fault requirement for divorce. The couple can file for divorce together or one party can file alone. If one party does not wish to get divorced or if they have children under 16 living at home, there is a required contemplation period of 6 to 12 months. During this period, they stay married and the request must be confirmed after the waiting period for the divorce to go through.\n\nToday, every state plus the District of Columbia permits no-fault divorce, though requirements for obtaining a no-fault divorce vary. California was the first U.S. state to pass a no-fault divorce law. Its law was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan, a divorced and remarried former movie actor, and came into effect in 1970. New York was the last state to pass a no-fault divorce law; that law was passed in 2010.\n\nBefore no-fault divorce was available, spouses seeking divorce would often allege false grounds for divorce. Removing the incentive to perjure was one motivation for the no-fault movement.\n\nIn the States of Wisconsin, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Nebraska, Montana, Missouri, Minnesota, Michigan, Kentucky, Kansas, Iowa, Indiana, Hawaii, Florida, Colorado and California, a person seeking a divorce is not permitted to allege a fault-based ground (e.g. adultery, abandonment or cruelty).\n\nPrior to the advent of no-fault divorce, a divorce was processed through the adversarial system as a civil action, meaning that a divorce could be obtained only through a showing of fault of \"one\" (and \"only\" one) of the parties in a marriage. This required that one spouse plead that the other had committed adultery, abandonment, felony, or other similarly culpable acts. However, the other spouse could plead a variety of defenses, like recrimination (essentially an accusation of \"so did you\"). A judge could find that the respondent had not committed the alleged act or the judge could accept the defense of recrimination and find \"both\" spouses at fault for the dysfunctional nature of their marriage. Either of these two findings was sufficient to defeat an action for divorce, which meant that the parties remained married.\n\nIn some states, requirements were even more stringent. For instance, under its original (1819) constitution, Alabama required not only the consent of a court of chancery for a divorce (and only \"in cases provided for by law\"), but equally that of two-thirds of both houses of the state legislature. This requirement was dropped in 1861, when the state adopted a new constitution at the outset of the American Civil War. The required vote in this case was even stricter than that required to overturn the governor's veto in Alabama, which required only a simple majority of both houses of the General Assembly.\n\nThese requirements could be problematic if both spouses were at fault or if neither spouse had committed a legally culpable act but both spouses desired a divorce by mutual consent. Lawyers began to advise their clients on how to create legal fictions to bypass the statutory requirements. One method popular in New York was referred to as \"collusive adultery\", in which both sides deliberately agreed that the wife would come home at a certain time and discover her husband committing adultery with a \"mistress\" obtained for the occasion. The wife would then falsely swear to a carefully tailored version of these facts in court (thereby committing perjury). The husband would admit a similar version of those facts. The judge would convict the husband of adultery, and the couple could be divorced.\n\nIn many other states, especially California, the most popular allegation for divorce was cruelty (which was then unavailable in New York). For example, in 1950, wives pleaded \"cruelty\" as the basis for 70 percent of San Francisco divorce cases. Wives would regularly testify to the same facts: their husbands swore at them, hit them, and generally treated them terribly. This procedure was described by Supreme Court of California Associate Justice Stanley Mosk:\n\nEvery day, in every superior court in the state, the same melancholy charade was played: the \"innocent\" spouse, generally the wife, would take the stand and, to the accompanying cacophony of sobbing and nose-blowing, testify under the deft guidance of an attorney to the spousal conduct that she deemed \"cruel.\"\n\nAn even simpler practice for people living in states where divorce was difficult to obtain was to go \"forum shopping.\" This meant one of the parties would move to another state where no-fault divorce was available, stay there long enough to become a resident, then file for divorce there. Nevada was extremely popular for this purpose as its residency period was only six weeks. For some couples, if there really was no problem in settling the issues of their marriage, a weekend trip to Mexico was also an option. Or in some cases, a party deciding they wanted to marry someone else could combine a filing for divorce and a new marriage in one trip to Mexico. As no-fault became near-universal, the need to use Nevada or Mexico to evade restrictive divorce laws became less and less necessary.\n\nMany American lawyers and judges objected to the legal fictions used to satisfy the requirements for divorce, which were effectively rendering oaths meaningless and threatening to wreck the integrity of the American justice system by making perjury into a commonplace occurrence. As early as the 1930s, a treatise on American family law complained:\n\nIn divorce litigation it is well known that the parties often seek to evade the statutory limitations and thus there is great danger of perjury, collusion, and fraud . . . . In many cases no defense is interposed, and often when the case is contested the contest is not waged with vigor or good faith.\n\nIn addition, advocates for no-fault divorce argued that the law should be changed to provide a straightforward procedure for ending a marriage, rather than forcing a couple who simply couldn't get along to choose between living together in \"marital hell\" or lying under oath in open court. The most prominent advocate of this position was feminist law professor Herma Hill Kay (who later became dean of UC Berkeley School of Law).\n\nAt its convention in 1947, the National Association of Women Lawyers (NAWL) voted to draft and promote a bill that would embody the ideal of no-fault divorce and describes its efforts to promote the passage of no-fault divorce laws as \"the greatest project NAWL has ever undertaken.\"\n\nOther states were slower to adopt no-fault divorce. For example, Pennsylvania did not introduce no-fault divorce until around 1980.\n\nCalifornia adopted no-fault divorce with the Family Law Act of 1969, which became effective January 1, 1970. The Act abolished California's action for divorce and replaced it with a proceeding for dissolution of marriage on the grounds of irreconcilable differences. The grounds of irreconcilable differences are accepted as true, and can be based on the assertions of \"one\" of the parties to the marriage.\n\nAt about the same time that California adopted no-fault divorce, the National Conference of Commissioners of Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) appointed a committee to draft a uniform marriage and divorce law for consideration by state legislatures, and the American Bar Association's Family Law Section was asked to appoint a committee to work with the committee from the NCCUSL. The initial draft of the Uniform Marriage and Divorce Law written by the NCCUSL committee would direct judges to grant the petitioner's request to end the marriage if the judge found that the marriage was \"irretrievably broken\", a term which this draft did not define. Since the term \"irretrievably broken\" was not defined, the committee from the American Bar Association (ABA) Family Law Section disapproved of this draft of the Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act. In response, the NCCUSL committee added a 180-day separation requirement in order for judges to find that the marriage had been irretrievably broken. However, the NCCUSL committee also added language to allow judges to grant a petitioner a divorce if \"there is serious marital discord adversely affecting one or both parties toward the marriage.\" A further problem with \"irretrievably broken\" is that it seems to assume that broken pieces are somehow acceptable if they can be retrieved, even though they are not put back together.\n\nThe committee from the ABA Family Law Section objected to the ability of a petitioner to avoid the 180-day separation requirement by asserting \"serious marital discord\". In his letter recommending that the American Bar Association House of Delegates not approve the amended draft proposed by the NCCUSL, Arnold J. Gibbs, the chairman of the ABA Family Law Section, stated that the NCCUSL's proposed draft created a rubber stamp type of divorce procedure. He wrote: \"The creation of a mere 'rubber stamp type' of divorce procedure would not be in the best interests of the family, its individual members, and society in general.\"\n\nCopies of the recommendation to disapprove the NCCUSL's amended draft were provided to the National Conference of Commissioners of Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL), Young Lawyers Section and the National Association of Women Lawyers (NAWL). The committee from the NCCUSL refused to further amend its draft of the Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act.\n\nAt the 1974 midwinter meeting of the American Bar Association in Houston, Council members of the Family Law Section indicated dissatisfaction with the public image the section was getting from its opposition to the NCCUSL's draft of the Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act. In a policy statement, the ABA Family Law Section chose \"to recognize separation only as conclusive evidence of marital breakdown and not as its unbending test\", implying that \"other kinds of evidence would be admissible to establish breakdown as well.\"\n\nBy 1977, nine states had adopted no-fault divorce laws, and by late 1983, every state but South Dakota and New York had adopted some form of no-fault divorce (although some forms were not as easy to obtain as that in California). South Dakota adopted no-fault divorce in 1985. Until August 2010, New York still lacked a unilateral no-fault divorce statute; under New York divorce law, only if \"both parties\" executed and acknowledged a separation agreement and lived separately for one year could a judge convert it into a divorce. New York governor David Paterson signed a no-fault divorce bill on August 15, 2010. , no-fault divorce is allowed in all fifty states and the District of Columbia.\n\n"}

The Ashikaga murder case is included in this.\n\nSince 1979, there have been five cases of kidnapping and/or murder of young girls between ages four and eight (four kidnappings and murders, one kidnapping where the kidnapped girl was never found) occurring within a 20 kilometer radius near the border between Tochigi and Gunma prefectures. All of these cases took place in Ota City of Gunma prefecture or Ashikaga city of Tochigi prefecture.\n\nIn 2007, investigative journalist Kiyoshi Shimizu began investigations into the similarities between the five cases, and came across how the Ashikaga murder case had already been solved, with the supposed culprit Toshikazu Sugaya having admitted (but not been charged with) two other murders. Shimizu's reporting on the subject led to the discovery that Sugaya was innocent, and the National Police Agency and Prosecutor's Office later acknowledged their wrongdoing and the nature of the five cases as a single serial case, and this was further affirmed by minister Kansei Nakano in a Diet session.\n\nThe statute of limitations is commonly brought up as all but the last of the 5 cases has had it pass. This was addressed in a diet meeting in 2011 in which then-prime minister Naoto Kan urged the police to catch the true culprit. The parents of the five girls have also urged the police to continue investigating, as has Sugaya.\n\nDespite acknowledging the serial nature of the cases, however, the police have not made any arrests in connection with them, and informed the mother of Mami Matsuda, the victim of the Ashikaga case, that they were no longer investigating her daughter's case due to the statute of limitations.\n\nWhile investigating the Ashikaga murder case, Shimizu discovered, among other things,\n\nSugaya also professes that his confession had been beaten out of him by detective Fumio Hashimoto, who had been in charge of the case.\n\nSugaya had previously been denied new DNA tests and a retrial despite DNA evidence presented by his lawyers and the support of the Japan Federation of Bar Associations. Shimizu reported widely on his findings, resulting in a DNA test and Sugaya's release from prison in 2009, and a retrial in 2010 which found him innocent.\n\nShimizu won the Editors' Choice Magazine Journalism Award for exposing this miscarriage of justice.\n\n\nThe following are used as reasoning behind the definition of this as a serial case:\n\nAll five crimes have not been resolved, with the culprit not arrested. The case has been given extensive media coverage, and has been brought up in the Japanese Diet multiple times, and was also addressed by then-prime minister Naoto Kan, who appealed to the police to solve the case.\n\nSecurity camera footage of the culprit exists from the 1996 kidnapping case, and eyewitnesses from the Ashikaga case have stated that he strongly resembles the man they saw.\n\nIn 2010 and 2011, Shimizu reported strong evidence that the perpetrator had been found, including DNA test results connecting him to the Ashikaga case (a 100% match to the results of new tests of the perpetrator's DNA) and video recordings of him talking to young girls and making them sit on his lap, and gave this information to the police, but no arrest was made. The reasoning given for the refusal to arrest the alleged perpetrator was that his DNA does not match that of the culprit previously found in the Ashikaga case.\n\nShimizu professes that the DNA testing methods used in the Ashikaga case were flawed, and that arresting the perpetrator would require the prosecutor's office to acknowledge this. However, the same testing methods were also used in the Iizuka case, in which the alleged culprit was executed in 2008 despite requests for new DNA tests and a retrial, and acknowledging that the testing methods were flawed would lead to a massive scandal around that case.\n\nShimizu's investigations into the Iizuka case found the possibility that a large amount of the evidence was doctored, and he concludes that it was the amount, and not quality of the evidence which led to the conviction, and that overturning even one piece of evidence would have caused the prosecutor's case to fall apart.\n\nAdditionally, when the mother of Mami Matsuda was informed by the police that they were no longer investigating her daughter's case due to the statute of limitations, she requested that they return her daughter's belongings, but they refused to return the shirt which has the true culprit's semen stains on it. They refused to give a straight answer as to why, and Shimizu suspects that this is because they are afraid that others might have the DNA of the true culprit tested by modern means, proving that the methods previously used returned wrong results.\n\n"}

{"id": "41256010", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41256010", "title": "Politics-administration dichotomy", "text": "Politics-administration dichotomy\n\nThe Politics-administration dichotomy is a theory that constructs the boundaries of public administration and asserts the normative relationship between elected officials and administrators in a democratic society. The phrase \"politics-administration dichotomy\" itself does not appear to have a known inventor, even after exhaustive research, the combination of words that make up the phrase was first found in public administration literature from the 1940s with no clear originator.\n\nWoodrow Wilson is credited with the politics-administration dichotomy via his theories on public administration in his 1887 essay, \"The Study of Administration\". Wilson came up with a theory that politics and administration are inherently different and should be approached as such. Wilson wrote in his essay in regards to public administration: “The field of administration is a field of business. It is removed from the hurry and strife of politics... Administration lies outside the proper sphere of politics. Administrative questions are not political questions. Although politics sets the tasks for administration, it should not be suffered to manipulate its offices.” With these words, Wilson started a debate that has been going on for decades and continues to this day. The politics-administration dichotomy is an important concept in the field of public administration and shows no signs of going away because it deals with the policy-makers role as an administrator and the balancing act that is the relationship between politics and administration. This essay is considered to be the first source to be analyzed and studied in the public administration field. Wilson was primarily influenced by Richard Ely and Herbert Adams who taught at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nWoodrow Wilson’s politics-administration dichotomy can potentially be substantial in sustaining a strong productive government. The complexity, difficulty level and ample multiplication of governmental functions can be seen as a main component in the cause to implement the politics-administration dichotomy. Due to Wilson's lack of faith in republican self-government and the overwhelming amount of “selfish, ignorant, timid, stubborn, or foolish” persons whom the “bulk of can vote,” this model provides a solution that would counteract the majority of the incumbent voters. By employing the elite philosophical leaders to improve, shape, condition and sway public opinion, politics-administration dichotomy, if carried out in an unselfish manner leaves little to no room for error. \n\nWoodrow Wilson’s model created one of the first concepts of checks and balances, which is one of the most predominant systems of democratic accountability used to shape the United States government. Nevertheless “separating the will of the people from politics” could be extremely beneficial and institutionally separating administration from politics could prove valuable in sustaining government accountability.\nPolitics-administration dichotomy also leads to political neutrality. The blurring of \"politics\" and \"policy\" has cause to the advocations to dismiss \"partisan politics\" rather than \"policy politics.\"\nThe importance of neutrality in politics and policy are established within the politics-administration dichotomy.\n\nStandard definition is too narrow . If politics includes all of what we know as policy making, then the dichotomy would bar administrators, presumably including city managers, from participation. The dichotomy of policy and administration was a conceptual distinction underlying a theory of democratic accountability. It was not intended to guide behavior, it was intended as a behavioral prescription directed against contemporary practices of machine politics.\nThe strict definition is the model. It is not conceptually possible to have a one way dichotomy that keeps elected official out of administration but allows administrators to be active in policy. The dichotomy model standing alone is an aberration.\n\nWoodrow Wilson\n"}

Major League Baseball Advanced Media\n\nRector v. Major League Baseball Advanced Media, No. 303630 (N.Y. Sup. Bronx Co. 2014), was a New York Supreme Court defamation case. Andrew Rector sued Major League Baseball, the New York Yankees, ESPN and their MLB announcers for broadcasting images of him sleeping at a game at Yankee Stadium between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox and allegedly making defamatory comments about him. Rector sued for $10 million for \"defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress\". The case was dismissed by Judge Julia Rodriguez, who ruled that the statements made were not defamatory.\n\nOn April 13, 2014, Rector attended Yankee Stadium to watch the New York Yankees play the Boston Red Sox in a Yankees–Red Sox rivalry game. During the fourth inning, Rector was filmed by ESPN sleeping in his seat with the footage broadcast to viewers during their live coverage of the game. ESPN New York announcers Dan Shulman and John Kruk made a number of jokes about him when his image was placed on the stadium jumbotron. They initially commented that Rector was oblivious to the quality of MLB.tv that they had been promoting in commentary prior to Rector's image being broadcast and then made comments about Rector, questioning how he could sleep through a Carlos Beltran home run and stated that the person who sat next to him did not want to share his food with Rector. They also compared Rector's body size to Kruk's. MLB later posted the broadcast video of Rector sleeping online where it was covered by a number of media organizations worldwide. Rector filed a defamation lawsuit at the New York Supreme Court in The Bronx, New York against MLB, ESPN, the Yankees and the ESPN announcers for $10 million alleging that they subjected him to \"an unending verbal crusade\". Legal experts speculated that the challenge would not be successful owing to the statements causing emotional stress rather than damaging reputation and due to defamation cases historically being unsuccessful under New York State law.\n\nRector alleged in his claim, which was reportedly full of typographical and grammatical errors, that the announcers had called him \"a fatty cow\", then used words such as \"stupor\", \"unintelligent\" and \"stupid\", and said that he was \"not worthy to be a fan.\" He also alleged that MLB.com had posted numerous memes, including one of him involved in a homosexual kiss and one with the caption of \"Yankee's Fan cares not for your rivalry talk\", that implied that he supported what was occurring in the images. He claimed that the MLB's posting of the video online \"set the stage\" for further defamatory comments from online viewers. The MLB's legal team filed a motion to dismiss on procedural grounds, as Rector had not stated a cause of action, and the statements in question had been loose and hyperbolic and not malicious defamation. The MLB, ESPN and the New York Yankees submitted CD copies of both the incident and the entire broadcast, which they stated showed that the statements alleged by the plaintiff were not made.\n\nIn court, Judge Julia Rodriguez granted the defendants' motions. In her judgement, she stated that the CDs of the broadcasts showed that the announcers did not make the statements alleged in the complaint and that they had been made by other individuals on websites not run by the defendants. While she agreed that comments had been made about Rector's weight and his ability to sleep through a standing ovation, he was only shown and commented on for 31 seconds; the judge ruled the comments made did not meet the legal standard of defamation. She also stated that ESPN had not broadcast Rector unauthorized, as it was common practice for broadcasters at baseball games to show spectators. Judge Rodriguez stated that with regard to Rector's claim of \"emotional distress\", none of the alleged comments were attributable to the defendants and they could not be held responsible for alleged defamatory comments made by third parties on third-party websites, as there was no duty of care to protect him from those statements. As a result, the case was dismissed.\n\nFollowing Rector's filing of the case being made public, news organisations criticized the action as frivolous litigation. Legal commentators stated that due to the media attention that the case brought, Rector probably ended up causing more damage to his reputation by bringing the case than the initial broadcast would have. Rector's lawyer, Valentine Okwara had stated that he had advised his client that \"there is room for appeal\". The lawsuit has since been used as a case study on the issue of defamation at sports events.\n"}
{"id": "23910053", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23910053", "title": "Salazar v. Buono", "text": "Salazar v. Buono\n\nSalazar v. Buono, 559 U.S. 700 (2010) was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States regarding the establishment clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The case concerned the legality of the Mojave Memorial Cross, a Latin cross which was placed atop a prominent rock outcropping, by the VFW foundation, in 1934 to honor war dead. The location is known as “Sunrise Rock” in the Mojave National Preserve in San Bernardino County in southeastern California. The Supreme Court ruled that the cross may stay, but also sent the case back to a lower court, making the issue currently unresolved.\n\nCurrently, there is a cross atop Sunrise Rock that is between tall and is constructed out of metal pipes painted white. Historical records reflect that a wooden cross was built on that location as early as 1934 by the Veterans of Foreign Wars as a memorial to veterans who died in World War I. Photographs depict the wooden cross and signs near it stating: “The Cross, Erected in Memory of the Dead of All Wars,” and “Erected 1934 by Members of Veterans of Foreign Wars, Joshua Tree post 2884.” The wooden signs are no longer present, and the original wooden cross, which is no longer standing, has been replaced by private parties several times since 1934. The cross has been an intermittent gathering place for Easter religious services since as early as 1935, and regularly since 1984. The current version of the cross was built by Henry Sandoz, a local resident, sometime in 1998. When the National Park Service (NPS) investigated the history of the cross, Sandoz explained that he drilled holes into Sunrise Rock to bolt the cross in place, making it difficult to remove. Sandoz did not receive a permit from NPS to construct the cross. No sign indicates that the cross was or is intended to act as a memorial for war veterans.\n\nIn 1999, NPS received a request from an individual seeking to build a stupa (a dome-shaped Buddhist shrine) on a rock outcropping at a trailhead located near the cross. NPS denied that request, citing 36 C.F.R. § 2.62(a) as prohibiting the installation of a memorial without authorization. A handwritten note on the denial letter warned that “[a]ny attempt to erect a stupa will be in violation of Federal Law and subject you to citation and/or arrest.” The letter also indicates that “[c]urrently there is a cross on [a] rock outcrop located on National Park Service lands. . . . It is our intention to have the cross removed.”\n\nIn 1999, NPS undertook a study of the history of the cross. NPS determined that neither the cross nor the property on which it is situated qualifies for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places. Specifically, NPS recognized that the cross itself “has been replaced many times and the plaque that once accompanied it (even though it is not known if it is original) has been removed.” Also, the property does not qualify as an historical site because, among other things, “the site is used for religious purposes as well as commemoration.” Following the announcement by NPS of its intention to remove the cross, the United States Congress passed a series of laws to preserve the Sunrise Rock cross. The first piece of legislation, enacted in December 2000, provided that no government funds could be used to remove the cross.\n\nFrank Buono, a former NPS employee, filed suit in March 2001 against the Secretary of the Department of the Interior, the Regional Director of NPS, and the Superintendent of the Preserve. The district court concluded that the presence of the cross in the Preserve violates the Establishment Clause. In July 2002, the court entered a permanent injunction ordering that the “Defendants, their employees, agents, and those in active concert with Defendants, are hereby permanently restrained and enjoined from permitting display of the Latin cross in the area of Sunrise Rock in the Mojave National Preserve.”\n\nIn January 2002, while this matter was pending in district court, Congress passed a defense appropriations bill, which included a section designating the Sunrise Rock cross as a “national memorial.”\n\nIn October 2002, less than three months after the district court’s injunction, in legislation aimed at the Sunrise Rock cross, Congress passed a defense appropriations bill that included a provision barring the use of federal funds “to dismantle national memorials commemorating United States participation in World War I.”\n\nIn September 2003 Congress enacted another defense appropriations bill that included a land exchange agreement regarding the Sunrise Rock cross in which an acre of land containing the cross was conveyed to the Veterans Home of California— Barstow, Veterans of Foreign Wars Post #385E in consideration for of land. The government retained a reversionary interest in the property subject to a condition that the recipient maintain the conveyed property as a memorial commemorating United States participation in World War I and honoring the American veterans of that war.\n\nIn June 2004, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court’s permanent injunction, holding that the presence of the cross in the Preserve violates the Establishment Clause. Despite the injunction against display of the cross in the Preserve, the government began moving forward with the mechanics of the land exchange under § 8121. Buono moved to enforce the district court’s prior injunction, or modify it to prohibit the land exchange as a violation of the Establishment Clause. In April 2005, the district court granted Buono’s motion to enforce the injunction, and denied as moot the request to amend the permanent injunction. According to the district court, “the transfer of the Preserve land containing the Latin Cross which as [a] sectarian war memorial carries an inherently religious message and creates an appearance of honoring only those servicemen of that particular religion is an attempt by the government to evade the permanent injunction enjoining the display of the Latin Cross atop Sunrise Rock.” The district court deemed the exchange “invalid” and permanently enjoined the government “from implementing the provisions of Section 8121 of Public Law 108-87” and ordered the government “to comply forthwith with the judgment and permanent injunction entered by th[e] court on July 24, 2002.” Id. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. The United States Supreme Court then granted the government's petition for a writ of certiorari.\n\nOn April 28, 2010, the United States Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the cross may stay but also sent the case back to a lower court. Writing for the plurality of the court, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote, \"The goal of avoiding governmental endorsement [of religion] does not require eradication of all religious symbols in the public realm\".\n\nOnly eleven days after the Supreme Court decision, the cross was stolen during the overnight of May 9–10, 2010; its theft is believed to be related to those who opposed the cross, but no arrests have been made to date (as the cross was filled with concrete, it would have been worthless for resale). National Park Service spokeswoman Linda Slater said a $25,000 reward has been offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the thieves; the reward was later increased to $100,000. The VFW promised that the memorial will be rebuilt.\"This was a legal fight that a vandal just made personal to 50 million veterans, military personnel and their families,\" National Commander Thomas J. Tradewell said. On May 20, a replica cross was discovered to have been erected in place of the original. Park officials said it was erected overnight, but because of the court ruling park employees would have to remove the replica. Another lawsuit has since been filed to expedite the land transfer.\n\n\n"}

The term was first used by Jagdish Bhagwati in 1995 in the paper: “\"US Trade policy: The infatuation with free trade agreements\"”, where he openly criticized FTAs as being paradoxically counter-productive in promoting freer and more opened global trades. According to Bhagwati, the too many crisscrossing FTAs would represent a costly complication of World trades, and would allow countries to adopt discriminative trade policies which would, in turns, reduce trade welfare.\n\nIn 1947, the most economically prominent nations signed the multilateral General Agreement on Tariffs and Trades (GATT), whose main goals were to reduce tariffs and other trade barriers as well as eliminate discriminatory treatments between signatory countries. After gradual rounds of negotiations, more countries were integrated and tariffs were significantly reduced. The World Trade Organization (WTO) was created in 1995 to meet the growing institutional needs of a deepening globalization.\n\nHowever, because of the increasing number of members and interest diversity, as well as the complication of the topics discussed (subsidies, intellectual property, etc.), liberalization negotiations have slowed down since the 1990s. The last WTO Negotiation Round, the Doha Round, launched in 2001, stalled over disagreements on agricultural subsidies and market access, as well as intellectual property issues.\n\nIn this way, many countries have been resorting to bilateral and multilateral FTAs as a faster and more flexible way to promote free trades and globalization. Indeed, FTAs require only the consent of a limited number of like-minded countries, as opposed to the general consent of all WTO members necessary to conclude a negotiation round. Such agreements also allow countries to tackle broader issues such as bilateral investments, labor migration and regulations. As a result, the numbers of FTAs in force and in negotiations have exploded since the mid-1990s, passing from 100 agreements in 1990 to more than 400 in 2008.\n\nThis FTA trend has been described by many economists as a more pragmatic way to promote free trade and globalization. Jagdish Bhagwati strongly opposes this opinion, describing the entanglement of hundreds of FTAs with various rules, tariffs and institutional arrangements as a “spaghetti bowl”.\n\nBhagwati identifies several problems inherent to FTAs, which make them unfit to promote a clear and global trade liberalization with widespread benefits: \nSeveral empirical studies have been led to determine the Spaghetti Bowl Effect’s true cost on countries’ trade volumes and competitiveness. Japanese Researchers from Keio University, observed 132 countries and established that, even though trade volumes were positively correlated with FTAs, this effect was characterized by diminishing returns. In this way, the increasingly heavy and costly administrative burden caused by the multiplication of FTAs would deter firms to use FTA’s preferential tariffs, thus proving a Spaghetti Bowl Effect.\n\nAsian countries have seen a dramatic rise in FTAs since the beginning of the 21st century. In 2000, only 3 FTAs were in force, nine years later, 37 FTAs were in force and 72 under negotiations. Important hubs, such as the People’s Republic of China, Japan and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) emerged. The growing de facto economic integration combined with a lack of common economic institutions has led Asian countries to adopt pro-FTAs trade policies.\n\nAs a result, both firms and governments, started to worry about the burden imposed by the Asian trade environment’s growing complication. This phenomenon was nicknamed \"The Noodle Bowl Effect\" by several newspapers and academics to highlight its endemic Asian nature. In a 2009 survey, only 20.8% of South Korean firms, 29% of Japanese firms and 45.1% of Chinese firms effectively used FTAs . 20% of the surveyed firms across Asia considered multiples rules of origins as costly for their businesses. Smaller firms were also more deterred from using FTAs’ preferential tariffs because of the high and complex administrative burden.\n"}

It would also enable the creation of a Special needs trust for a person with disabilities. The proposal, initiated by Jaret L.

It is still partly in force in Great Britain.\n\nThe Act was passed at a time when Parliament was anxious to ensure the succession of a Protestant on the death of Queen Anne. It replaced the Regency Act 1705. The Act required privy counsellors and other officers, in the event of Anne's death, to proclaim as her successor the next Protestant in the line of succession to the throne, and made it high treason for any of them to fail to do so.\n\nIf the next monarch was overseas at the time of the succession, the government would be run until he or she returned by between seven and fourteen \"Lords Justices.\" Seven of the Lords Justices were named in the Act, and the next monarch could appoint seven more, who would be named in writing, three copies of which were to be sent to the Privy Council in England. The Act made it treason for any unauthorised person to open these, or to neglect to deliver them to the Privy Council. The Lords Justices were to have the power to give royal assent to bills, except that they would be guilty of treason if they amended the Act of Uniformity 1662 or the Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Act 1707.\n\nThe Act also provided that if Parliament was sitting at the time of the monarch's death, then it would be able to sit for a further six months unless dissolved by a new legitimate monarch. If the monarch were to die and Parliament was not at that time sitting, then it would immediately convene. These clauses remain in force today (without the six month time limit on Parliament's continued existence, which was repealed in 1878).\n\nThe Act also made it treason maliciously, advisedly and directly by writing or printing to maintain and affirm that any person has a right to the Crown otherwise than according to the Act of Settlement and Acts of Union, or that the Crown and Parliament cannot pass statutes for the limitation of the succession to the Crown. It was praemunire to say so in speech. These provisions were extended to Scotland by the Treason Act 1708, and were repealed in 1967 (however see the Treason Act 1702 which makes similar provision).\n\nAnne died on 1 August 1714 and was succeeded as a result of the Act of Settlement 1701 by the Elector of Hanover, George Louis, as King George I, who arrived in Great Britain on 18 September 1714.\n\nSections 1 to 3 were repealed by the Criminal Law Act 1967. The whole Act was formally repealed in the Republic of Ireland by the Statute Law Revision Act 2007.\n\nThis Act is not to be confused with \"6 Ann. c.14\", which is entitled \"An act for the better security of Her Majesty's person and government\" but which is not about treason.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25137752", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25137752", "title": "Taxation in Azerbaijan", "text": "Taxation in Azerbaijan\n\nThe tax legislation of Azerbaijan is comprised by the Constitution of Azerbaijan Republic, the Tax Code and legal standards which are adopted herewith. The taxes levied in Azerbaijan can be generally broken down into 3 main types: state taxes, taxes of autonomy republic and local (municipal) taxes. State taxes include the following: personal income tax, corporate tax, value added tax, excise tax, property tax, land tax, road tax, mineral royalty tax and simplified tax. Taxes of autonomy republic are the same as state taxes but levied in Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic.\n\nThe Tax Code of Azerbaijan Republic was approved on 11 July 2000 and consists of two parts. The \"General Part\" indicates the rights and responsibilities of taxpayers, tax agents and tax authorities, procedures of tax registration, tax control and audit. The second part, also referred to as \"Special Section,\" defines specific taxes and their bases, rates, payment schedules and procedures. There exist separate taxation procedures for Production Sharing Agreements (PSAs).\n\nFrom 2010, the government revenues from taxes started to rise. Thus, in 2014, tax revenues as percentage from GDP totaled 14.213%. Highest shares of tax revenues came from value added tax and corporate profit taxes in 2014. In 2015, tax revenues as percentage of GDP were equal to 15.6%.\n\nThe central executive body which provides the implementation and control of tax policies in the country, collection and transfer of tax payments into the government budget is Ministry of Taxes of Azerbaijan Republic.\n\nIn Azerbaijan, on January 1, 2001, a new tax code went into effect. Personal income rates remained the same, at rates ranging from 12–35%, as did the corporate tax rate, at 27%. However, as of 2005, the corporate rate was set at 24%. The revised depreciation schedule for corporate assets favors investments in high-tech equipment and oil and gas exploration. Depreciation rates are 10% a year for buildings, 25% a year for equipment and computers, 25% for geological and exploratory costs, and 20% a year for all other assets. However, accelerated depreciation is allowed for capital spending allocated for production purposes at twice the standard rates. Included in this are expenditures on the building of those facilities that are to be used in the actual manufacture of goods. The value-added tax (VAT) was reduced from 20% to 18%, while the property tax was raised from .5% to 1% of assessed value. A .05% Road Fund Tax on turnover was abolished, but there is a highway tax imposed on foreign-registered vehicles collected by customs authorities. There are payroll taxes paid by the employer amounting to 32%, 30% going to the Social Protection Fund, and 2% going to the Employment Fund. There are excise taxes, but excise paid for goods used in production can be off set against excise charged for the finished product. In 2001, total government revenue came to an estimated 21.4% of GDP, while total expenditures, including net lending, amounted to only 20% of GDP, producing a positive fiscal balance equal to 1.4% of GDP.\n\nCurrently, Azerbaijan has 3 distinct tax regimes. These are the following: statutory tax regime, tax regime that relates to companies operating under Production Sharing Agreements and tax regime that relates to companies operating under Host Government Agreements.\n\nThe statutory tax regime is applicable to all companies operating in Azerbaijan, except for those, who are involved into oil and gas industry.\n\nThe regime related to Production Sharing Agreements covers the rules for more than twenty existing PSAs. Milli Majlis has ratified these PSAs.\n\nThe rules related to Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil export and South Caucasus pipelines are covered by Host Government Agreements tax regime.\n\nThe tax year in Azerbaijan starts in January, 1st and ends in December, 31st. The tax declaration has to be filled in and submitted by enterprises no later than 31 March following the calendar year and users of simplified tax should submit the declaration no later than 20 April. Natural persons who have stayed in Azerbaijan 182 days in a calendar year are accounted as residents and are responsible for paying the taxes. Residents of Azerbaijan are taxable on their international income, whereas non-residents are taxable on the Azerbaijani source income only.\n\nTaxes can be withhold from people who are related to employment activities, as well as non-entrepreneurial activities such as interest income, dividends, capital gains and royalties.\n\nAgricultural income, gifts and inheritance from family members, capital gains, income from crafts production, lottery prizes, alimonies and compensation receipts are exempt from taxation. Standard deductions are applicable for war heroes, their families and military officials.\n\nIncome taxes in Azerbaijan are set at progressive rate. The taxable base for residents is income which has been earned in or outside of Azerbaijan. For non-residents income which is taxed are the following – income which is both connected and not connected with employment and also all other kinds of income which are not tax-exempt or arose from revaluation of assets. Tax rate on income of natural persons receiving less than 2500 AZN is 14%, if income is more than 2500 AZN, then 25% tax is levied on the proportion which is exceeding 2500 AZN.\n\nProfit is defined as the difference between income and expenses. The profits of all resident-enterprises should be taxed. If legal person is permanently established in Azerbaijan – then its profits should be taxed. Otherwise, it should be taxed at the source of payment without subtracting its expenses. Gains, which arise from revaluation of assets are not subject to taxation. The profits are taxed at 20% rate.\n\nValue Added Tax (VAT) rate is 18%. All works, goods, services provided and taxable imports constitute the base for taxation. There also exists zero (0) rate VAT in the country for the issues related with financial aids, diplomacy, cargo and valuable goods.\n\nExcise taxes are indirect taxes which are included in the sales price of goods. All excise goods that are produced or imported to Azerbaijan are subject to taxation. Alcohol and all types of alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, light vehicles, leisure and sports floating transports, imported platinum, gold and jewelry are subject to excise tax. There is no fixed tax rate for all types of goods, instead, there are different rates for each of the product and its amounts. For example, wine and vineyard materials are taxed at 0.1 AZN per liter.\n\nTaxable base of property tax for physical persons are the value of buildings and their parts, any water and air transportation or facility. For legal enterprises it is only average annual value of fixed assets. The rates are specified based on the area where buildings are located. Thus, for Baku it is 0.4 AZN per each square meter, Gyandja, Sumgait, and Absheron regions – 0.3 AZN, other cities and regions – 0.2 AZN, cities and towns of regional subordination – 0.1 AZN.\n\nResidents, as well as non-residents and businesses are obliged to register for paying taxes after proving their rights to use the land, and regardless of the results of economic activities on the land itself it is mandatory to pay land tax. The tax rates differ by the purpose of use and the area where the land is located. Generally, the tax rates are higher for the big and industrial cities. Land tax rates for agricultural use is 0.06 AZN for each conventional point.\n\nThe taxable base for this type of tax constitutes the motor vehicles which are imported to the country by non-residents and are used for transportation, as well as all motor fuels, diesel that has been either produced or imported to Azerbaijan Republic for domestic use. Taxes for motor cars are calculated depending on engine cubic capacity and period of presence, for buses – number of seats and period of presence, for trucks – number of axis and period of presence. Generally, these taxes may vary from 20 USD to 2800 USD and higher. For transportation, delivering dangerous cargo there is specific procedure of calculation.\n\nThese taxes are paid by physical entities and enterprises which extract mineral resources from the territory of Azerbaijan Republic, including area of Caspian Sea which belongs to the country. Tax rates for crude oil is 26%, natural gas – 20%, all types of metals – 3%.\n\nSimplified tax is applicable to entities, whose volume of transactions does not exceed 200.000 AZN in 12 consecutive months. Gross volume of cash flows received in respect of goods and services provided is subject to taxation. Simplified tax rate for Baku is 4%, for other regions – 2%, for trading activities – 6%, for public catering activity – 8%.\n\nMinistry of Taxes of Azerbaijan Republic\n\nEconomy of Azerbaijan\n\nEconomic development in Azerbaijan\n\n"}

The term \"rapporteur\" is a French-derived word for an investigator who reports to a deliberative body.\nThe mandate by the United Nations has been to \"examine, monitor, advise, and publicly report\" on human rights problems through \"activities undertaken by special procedures, including responding to individual complaints, psychological operations and manipulation via the controlled media and academia, conducting studies, providing advice on technical cooperation at the country level, and engaging in general promotional activities.\" However, the manual \"Internal Advisory Procedure to Review Practices and Working Methods\" (25 June 2008) of the Coordination Committee of Special Procedures simply calls these individuals mandate-holders. Other applications of the role include \"special representative of the secretary-general\" or \"independent expert\", or a working group usually composed of five members, one from each region of the planet.\n\nAppointed by the Human Rights Council of the UN, these mandate-holders act independently of governments and as such play an important role in monitoring sovereign nations and democratically elected governments and policies. The earliest such appointment was the 1980 Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances responding to Commission on Human Rights resolution 20 (XXXVI). The first Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions reporting to Commission on Human Rights resolution 1982/35 begun work in 1982.\nThey do not receive any financial compensation for their work from the United Nations, though they receive personnel and logistical support from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and are often backed by charities and corporations.\n\nTo mark Human Rights Day in 2006, the 37 special rapporteurs, special representatives and independent experts issued a joint statement on the importance of human rights in the fight against poverty.\n\nSpecial Rapporteurs often conduct fact-finding missions to countries to investigate allegations of human rights violations. They can only visit countries that have agreed to invite them.\n\nAside from fact-finding missions, Rapporteurs regularly assess and verify complaints from alleged victims of human rights violations. Once a complaint is verified as legitimate, an urgent letter or appeal is sent to the government that has allegedly committed the violation. If no complaint has been made, Rapporteurs may intervene on behalf of individuals and groups of people of their own accord.\n\nThematic special rapporteurs are typically appointed to serve for three years, after which their mandate can be extended for another three years. Country special rapporteurs are appointed to serve for one year, and their term is renewed every year.\n\nIn June 2006, the United Nations Human Rights Council, which replaced the UN Commission on Human Rights, extended the mandates of all special rapporteurs by one year to enable it to conduct a review of the mandates and seek ways of strengthening their roles. However, special rapporteurs for countries which did not approve a special rapporteur came under question and the mandates of the special rapporteurs for Cuba and Belarus were not renewed.\n\nOther controversies between the special rapporteurs and the council include the introduction of a code of conduct which initially disallowed the special rapporteurs from addressing the media. However a compromise was reached and a code of conduct now exists for the special rapporteurs.\n\nThe HRC oversees 43 thematic and 14 specific country mandates for which it can assign special rapporteurs. Currently there are at least 38 Special Rapporteurs, Special Representatives and Independent Experts who serve under the following country and thematic mandates:,\n\nPreviously: Makarim Wibisono (2014–2016)Previously: Richard A.

The school, founded in 1884, is located on the University of Oregon campus in Eugene, on the corner of 15th and Agate streets, overlooking Hayward Field.\n\nOregon Law was founded in 1884 in Portland, Oregon. Richard R. Thornton organized the department that began as a two-year program with three classes per week. In 1906, the course of study was expanded to three years, and in April 1915, the school's board of regents ordered that the program be moved to Eugene as part of a consolidation program within the university. Though the school moved, some of the faculty remained in Portland and started the Northwest College of Law, now the Lewis & Clark Law School. In 1923, the school was approved by the American Bar Association (ABA), one of the first 39 schools to earn that distinction in the initial year of the ABA approval of law schools.\n\nIn 1931, Wayne Morse became dean. Three years later, the law school organized a chapter of the national law school honor society, the Order of the Coif. In 1938, the law school moved to Fenton Hall. In 1939, the law school graduated Minoru Yasui, who later took his challenge to the military curfew on Japanese Americans during World War II all the way to the United States Supreme Court.\n\nIn 1941, Orlando John Hollis became acting dean. His appointment became permanent in 1945 when Morse resigned to run for the U.S. Senate. During the war years, many law students were called to service. In 1944, there were no graduating students; in 1945, only one student graduated. After the war's conclusion, the school admitted every returning veteran who sought a legal education: out of 26 students who graduated in 1948, 25 had served in World War II.\n\nThe post-war era was marked by the Oregon legislature's adoption of law professor Kenneth O'Connell's Oregon Revised Statutes. Professor O'Connell was appointed to the Oregon Supreme Court in 1958, and later became its chief justice.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Professor (and later dean) Chapin Clark offered the school's first courses in environmental and natural resources law. Later that decade, Professor Jon Jacobson founded the school's Ocean and Coastal Law Center. In 1968, Eugene Scoles became dean.\n\nIn 1970, the law school moved into a new building, the Law Center. In 1974, the Wayne Morse Chair of Law and Politics was established as a \"living memorial\" to former dean and U.S. Senator Wayne Morse. In 1977, Professor Hans A. Linde was appointed to the Oregon Supreme Court. In 1978, the school established the first-in-the-world Environmental Law Clinic.\n\nDuring the 1980s, the Environmental Law Clinic doubled in size and was renamed the Pacific Northwest Natural Resources Clinic. In 1981, Professor Dave Frohnmayer became Oregon Attorney General. In 1982, students organized the first Public Interest Environmental Law Conference. In 1986, the \"Journal of Environmental Law and Litigation\" began publication.\n\nIn the new century, the school opened the Appropriate Dispute Resolution Program. In 2003, the Environmental and Natural Resources Law Program opened a fully staffed office. In 2004, the Center for Law and Entrepreneurship opened a Small Business Clinic to assist small and micro-businesses. The school also has started a program in Portland, which moved into Portland's White Stag Building in 2008. The Portland Program focuses on business law and related externships.\n\nFor the 2016–17 academic year, the law school is ranked 78th in the country by \"U.S. News & World Report\" 's 2016 edition of \"America's Best Graduate Schools.\"\n\nThe University of Oregon is known for possessing the nation's first public law school to establish an environmental law program (ENR). The ENR Program is ranked 6th in the country by \"U.S. News & World Report\" for the 2012–13 academic year. The program includes a master's of law degree (LL.M.) option.\n\nThe law school also houses a prominent Appropriate Dispute Resolution Center, which provides courses both to law students and to graduate students interested in Conflict and Dispute Resolution. The ADR program is ranked 7th in the country by \"U.S. News & World Report\" for the 2015–16 academic year.\n\nThe law school's Legal Research and Writing (LRW) Program also is well regarded. For the 2015–16 academic year, \"U.S. News & World Report\" ranked the LRW Program 4th in the nation.\n\nAccording to Oregon's official 2013 ABA-required disclosures, 50.3% of the Class of 2013 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment nine months after graduation. Oregon's Law School Transparency under-employment score is 29.1%, indicating the percentage of the Class of 2013 unemployed, pursuing an additional degree, or working in a non-professional, short-term, or part-time job nine months after graduation.\n\nThe total cost of attendance (indicating the cost of tuition, fees, and living expenses) at Oregon for the 2014–2015 academic year is $54,028 for non-residents and $46,558 for Oregon residents. The Law School Transparency estimated debt-financed cost of attendance for three years is $199,048 for non-residents and $170,167 for Oregon residents.\n\nThe Public Interest Environmental Law Conference (PIELC) is a conference held annually on the first weekend in March at the University of Oregon School of Law in Eugene, Oregon, United States. The conference is a gathering of environmental activists, advocates, and students from across the United States and the world.\n\nPIELC is organized and hosted by the students involved in the environmental law society \"Land Air Water\" (LAW). Land Air Water is a student group at the University of Oregon School of Law. It is co-sponsored by Friends of Land Air Water, a University of Oregon/Land Air Water alumni group that helps advise the student organizers.\n\nThe conference has six to ten internationally recognized keynote addresses and over 120 panels. The conference has been held since 1983 and celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2012.\n\nThe conference is held on the first weekend in March. Early panels start Thursday afternoon, and the official opening is Thursday evening. It closes with a final address Sunday at noon. Typically the conference has around 2,000 attendees.\n\nThe content of the conference is aimed at professional environmental activists, such as people that work in non-profit public interest organizations such as the Wilderness Society, the Sierra Club, and the Oregon Natural Desert Association and public interest environmental attorneys like Earthjustice, Natural Resources Defense Council, and private public interest attorneys. CLE credits are available.\n\nThe conference is also of interest to students of environmental law and environmental studies, and each year it hosts groups from around a dozen different schools.\n\nThe conference is unapologetically pro-public interest, and pro-environment. It does not attempt to persuade the general public that environmental issues matter. It is a forum for the people who are actively enforcing environmental law, and promoting environmental values to talk among themselves, and share experiences, strategies, and news.\n\n\n"}

After a brother died in infancy, Wiley's sister Margaret was born in 1897. His family moved about while he was young.\n\nHe attended Maryville College and then the University of Wisconsin–Madison, graduating from there in 1914. Rutledge taught high school in Indiana while attending the present-day Indiana University Maurer School of Law part-time. He later moved to Colorado, and received a degree from the University of Colorado Law School in Boulder. While matriculating at Colorado, Rutledge joined the Pi Chapter of Alpha Sigma Phi Fraternity.\n\nThe year he graduated from law school, on August 28, 1917, Rutledge married Annabel Person. The couple had three children: Mary Lou (1922), Jean Ann (1925), and Neal (1927).\n\nRutledge was the great-great-grandson of Edward Rutledge, signer of the Declaration of Independence. Edward Rutledge's brother, John Rutledge, was twice nominated by President George Washington to the United States Supreme Court.\n\nRutledge worked in private practice in Boulder for a few years before deciding to pursue an academic career. He taught law at the University of Colorado (1924–26) and at Washington University in St. Louis 1926–30 and was Dean 1930–35, where the Wiley Rutledge Moot Court competition is named in his honor. He was named Dean of the University of Iowa College of Law in 1935. From this position, Rutledge was a vocal supporter of Franklin Roosevelt's plan to pack the Supreme Court.\n\nRoosevelt appointed Rutledge to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1939. When Supreme Court justice James F. Byrnes resigned in the fall of 1942 to help supervise wartime mobilization, Roosevelt nominated Rutledge to his position. Rutledge was significantly less conservative than Byrnes and he remained a steady ally of Roosevelt throughout his court career.\n\nRutledge articulated strong liberal positions, particularly in his interpretation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. He wrote for the court in 1946 in \"Kotteakos v. United States\" that \"our Government is not one of mere convenience or efficiency. It too has a stake, with every citizen, in his being afforded our historic individual protections, including those surrounding criminal trials. About them we dare not become careless or complacent when that fashion has become rampant over the earth.\"\n\nRutledge extended this position to dissent from the Court's decision in \"Yamashita v. Styer\", in which Japanese general Tomoyuki Yamashita filed for \"habeas corpus\" to appeal his conviction for war crimes in World War II. He wrote:\n\nAccording to Justice Frankfurter, Rutledge was part of the more liberal \"axis\" of justices on the Court, along with Justices Murphy, Douglas, and Black; the group would for years oppose Frankfurter's ideology of judicial restraint. Douglas, Murphy, and then Rutledge were the first justices to agree with Black's notion that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporated the Bill of Rights protection into it; this view would later become law.\n\nRutledge served on the court until his death. On August 27, 1949, Rutledge was vacationing in Maine. He had a stroke while driving his car and died two weeks later, aged fifty-five. His remains are interred at Green Mountain Cemetery in Boulder, Colorado.\n\nOne of Rutledge's law clerks, John Paul Stevens, was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1975. His tenure on the Court influenced Justice Stevens, who had helped Rutledge draft his dissent in \"Ahrens v. Clark\". In 1948, a 6-3 majority of the Supreme Court ruled that unless detained persons are within the physical jurisdiction of the District Court when they petition for a writ of habeas corpus, that court has no jurisdiction to hear the case. Rutledge dissented, arguing that instead of the jurisdiction deriving from the location of the prisoner, it should instead derive from the custodian, the person responsible for the imprisonment. John Paul Stevens later tracked this case and its application to case law. In 1973, the Supreme Court substantially overturned \"Ahrens\", ruling similarly to how Rutledge would have. Justice Rutledge's views were formally endorsed by the Supreme Court in 2004, when Justice John Stevens ruled in \"Rasul v. Bush\" that courts were to consider the location of the custodian, rather than the physical location of the prisoner themselves. This ruling allowed detainees in Guantanamo Bay to sue in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for a writ of habeas corpus.\n\nWhile on vacation in York, Maine, he died of a stroke while driving a car.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42480066", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42480066", "title": "Youth justice in New Zealand", "text": "Youth justice in New Zealand\n\nThe youth justice system in New Zealand comprises organs and processes that deal with offending by children aged 10–13 years and young people aged 14–16 years. These differ from general criminal processes, and are governed by different principles.\n\nNew Zealand has historically focused on a welfare model for youth offenders, which put the child's needs at the forefront. This often involved taking the child away from their family and by putting them into institutions.\n\nThe Children, Young Persons, and Their Families Act 1989 (CYPTFA) signified a shift away from this to a family-based process and justice model, which views state intervention as a last resort. The argument supporting this was that the community needed to be kept together, and these ties were important for helping youth.\n\nNew Zealand legislation differentiates justice processes for under-17-year-olds.\nThe CYPTFA governs these processes. They are diversion-focused, and include the dual aim of rehabilitation and accountability.\n\nOther legislation is also relevant, particularly the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 (NZBORA). This includes a child's right to be dealt with in a manner that takes into account their age.\n\nThe CYPTFA creates two separate justice processes for children and youth. This differentiation is based on the attitude that younger people are more vulnerable and have a more immature judgment, and this should be accounted for. The different processes recognise the child or youth's offending in a manner that acknowledges their higher needs and vulnerability. Thus, levels of culpability are determined by age group. However, major legislative changes now allow children to be prosecuted if the crime is sufficiently severe.\n\nThe Act aims to promote the well-being of children, young persons and their families. The process is aimed to reduce the levels of youth incarceration and constructively deal with issues and problems created by youth and children. This is done by holding the child or young person accountable for their behaviour and encouraging them to accept responsibility for their offending, while taking into account their needs and ensuring they are given the chance to develop beneficially from the experience.\n\nPrinciples governing youth justice reflect different objectives from traditional criminal prosecution. These are:\n\nA child under the age of ten cannot be convicted of an offence. If the child is aged 10 or 11, they can be prosecuted for murder or manslaughter. If the offender is aged 12 or 13, they can only be prosecuted for an offence if the maximum penalty is 14 years imprisonment or more, or if the maximum penalty is 10 years imprisonment or more if they are a repeat offender and the previous offence had a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment or more. All children aged between 10 and 13 have a rebuttable presumption of incapacity to commit a crime. Young persons aged 14 to 16 may be prosecuted for any crime, unless a higher age limit is stated in the specific legislation (e.g. people under 16 cannot be convicted of incest).\n\nIf the child is brought within the court system, the judge has a discretion to not use the criminal process and direct them towards social welfare.\n\nWhen the child offender does not fall into these categories, they are dealt with under the care and protection provisions of CYPTFA, or by the police, which are governed by youth justice principles.\n\nIf between 14 and 17, the court will have regard to the age of the offender. If the crime is dealt with in the Youth Court, then the Youth Justice Act and youth principles will apply. However the offender can be sent to the District Court or High Court for sentencing or trial, where the Sentencing Act 2002 applies. Under the Sentencing Act 2002, a child or young person under 17 cannot be sentenced to prison or home detention unless they commit a Category 4 offence (e.g. murder, manslaughter, crimes against the State) or an offence where the maximum penalty is 14 years imprisonment or more.\n\nThere are several international conventions that affect youth justice, most significantly the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child 1990 (UNCROC), which New Zealand ratified in 1993. This requires New Zealand to submit regular reports on the status of children's rights. The latest UN recommendations in response to this has expressed concern about the low age of criminal responsibility, and that NZ has lowered it from 14 to 12 for grave and repeated offences. There is also concern that CYPTFA only extends youth justice protections to 17 years, where UNCROC has defined a \"child\" up unto 18 years. Once young people turn 17, they are dealt with in adult courts, although age can be taken as a mitigating factor.\n\nCYPTFA established an alternative system of dealing with child and youth offenders through Family Group Conferences (FGC) and the Youth Court, with the exception of non-imprisonable traffic offences in the case of young persons.\nThis is combined with various policies employed by the police to decrease the use of the court system when possible.\n\nThe first step is the FGC, which is used as both a pre- and post-charge mechanism. They are designed to encourage collaborative decision-making by all affected parties, reflecting Maori custom. Their purpose is to provide recommendation and make decisions that are thought to be \"necessary or desirable in relation to the child or young person in respect of whom the conference was convened\". If a unanimous decision is not reached, the case can go to the youth court judge.\n\nPre-charge FGCs account for 40% of FGCs, and are employed to determine whether prosecution can be avoided. Post-charge, they determine how to deal with cases admitted or proved in the Youth Court.\n\nThere is limited data on the effectiveness of FGCs.\n\nThe focus on the family has been criticised as sometimes resulting in a tension between promoting the child’s development while also addressing underlying causes for their offending, such as their family. The system may not work well for those who come from dysfunctional families, as youth justice principles aim to keep the child with their family, but this is on the assumption that the family has the ability and the interest to control young people and believes offending is not acceptable. For young people such as these, the youth justice system may be better able to provide guidance.\n\nPolice play a major role in youth justice, and such cases are governed by the principle that criminal proceedings should not be used if there is an alternative way of dealing with the offending. This means that most child and youth apprehensions are dismissed by way of police warning, cautions, or diversion. 62% of youth crime is handled by police without moving onward to FGCs or Youth Court. Police have two statutory alternatives to the formal criminal justice process.\n\nPolice officers are able to issue a warning where appropriate and consider that sufficient. There will be written notice of the warning. Warnings may be issued when the police officer is satisfied the person is guilty, but do not need an admission of guilt.\n\nWarnings have been criticised as they may end up on the youth’s record regardless of whether the young person is guilty or not. Additionally, it may label them as acting with criminal behaviour when they did nothing.\n\nThese are a more formal alternative to warnings. This follows the Family Group Conference approach, and is one of the possible outcomes.\n\nThis is a possible police option and is widely used for minor child and youth offending. This is a discretionary response and offers a lot of flexibility to the Police Youth Aid who administers it. Practical examples of potential actions are:\n\nThere is no need for a FGC, and the process considers a number of criteria.\nUsing identity evidence as a bargaining tool has been questioned, as usually police are not able to hold such information unless the offender has been questioned.\n\nThe relationship between FGC and police diversion has been questioned. Diversion challenges the primacy of FGCs, as 62% of cases do not get to FGCs, and are instead dealt with by the police. The police refer around 6% of cases to FGCs, and outcomes here are agreed and implemented, typically without referral to the Court. The other 29% of cases involve youths being arrested and directly referred to the Youth Court, who have an obligation to refer all proved cases under its jurisdiction to a FGC for a recommendation. The reasoning for this is unclear, but it is questioned if it is useful to divert and keep the youth out of the system, or if this process is undermining the process and role of the family.\n\nPolice motives are also questioned. It is argued that police are avoiding FGCs because either they want to keep people out of the system or they do not trust it as an option.\n\nThe Youth Court is less formal than other courts, and the judge is more active in explaining the procedure as well as gathering data. The punishments are less severe, and are grouped depending on their restrictiveness into seven categories. The court has a stronger focus on restorative justice, reflected in the involvement of the victims, the young person's understanding and co-operation in the proceedings, acknowledgement of the power imbalanced by proving all young people with a lawyer, and the restorative justice outcomes promoted.\n\nThe Youth Court is a subdivision of the District Court and has the same general status and powers. Youth Court decisions are appealed to the High Court.\n\nYouth are over-represented in the criminal justice system. Young people aged 14–16 account for around 15% of all police arrests, which is second only to 17- to 20-year-olds. However, the number of apprehensions is decreasing.\n\nThe number and rate of youth appearing in court is also declining, with only the most serious cases reaching court. Nearly 80% of child and youth cases are dealt with by FGCs or police alternative actions, including diversions, before reaching court.\n\nIn line with adult statistics, the majority of youth appearing in court are male. While the rate of males appearing in court has substantially decreased in recent years, they still account for 79% of young people appearing in court.\n\nThe rate of females appearing in court has also decreased; however it is less marked that males.\n\nWhile the number of children and young people recorded as Māori has decreased, they are still over-represented in court. Around 20 percent of the youth population is Māori, yet Māori account for 54% of all children and youth in court.\n\nThe number of children and young people recorded as European appearing in court has decreased most substantially. Between 2002 and 2011, the rate dropped by 18%.\n\n"}
{"id": "195337", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=195337", "title": "Zigbee", "text": "Zigbee\n\nZigbee is an IEEE 802.15.4-based specification for a suite of high-level communication protocols used to create personal area networks with small, low-power digital radios, such as for home automation, medical device data collection, and other low-power low-bandwidth needs, designed for small scale projects which need wireless connection. Hence, Zigbee is a low-power, low data rate, and close proximity (i.e., personal area) wireless ad hoc network.\n\nThe technology defined by the Zigbee specification is intended to be simpler and less expensive than other wireless personal area networks (WPANs), such as Bluetooth or more general wireless networking such as Wi-Fi. Applications include wireless light switches, home energy monitors, traffic management systems, and other consumer and industrial equipment that requires short-range low-rate wireless data transfer.\n\nIts low power consumption limits transmission distances to 10–100 meters line-of-sight, depending on power output and environmental characteristics. Zigbee devices can transmit data over long distances by passing data through a mesh network of intermediate devices to reach more distant ones. Zigbee is typically used in low data rate applications that require long battery life and secure networking (Zigbee networks are secured by 128 bit symmetric encryption keys.) Zigbee has a defined rate of 250 kbit/s, best suited for intermittent data transmissions from a sensor or input device.\n\nZigbee was conceived in 1998, standardized in 2003, and revised in 2006. The name refers to the waggle dance of honey bees after their return to the beehive.\n\nZigbee is a low-cost, low-power, wireless mesh network standard targeted at battery-powered devices in wireless control and monitoring applications. Zigbee delivers low-latency communication. Zigbee chips are typically integrated with radios and with microcontrollers. Zigbee operates in the industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) radio bands: 2.4 GHz in most jurisdictions worldwide; though some devices also use 784 MHz in China, 868 MHz in Europe and 915 MHz in the USA and Australia, however even those regions and countries still use 2.4 GHz for most commercial Zigbee devices for home use. Data rates vary from 20 kbit/s (868 MHz band) to 250 kbit/s (2.4 GHz band).\n\nZigbee builds on the physical layer and media access control defined in IEEE standard 802.15.4 for low-rate wireless personal area networks (WPANs). The specification includes four additional key components: network layer, application layer, \"Zigbee Device Objects\" (ZDOs) and manufacturer-defined application objects. ZDOs are responsible for some tasks, including keeping track of device roles, managing requests to join a network, as well as device discovery and security.\n\nThe Zigbee network layer natively supports both star and tree networks, and generic mesh networking. Every network must have one coordinator device. Within star networks, the coordinator must be the central node. Both trees and meshes allow the use of Zigbee routers to extend communication at the network level. Another defining feature of Zigbee is facilities for carrying out secure communications, protecting establishment and transport of cryptographic keys, ciphering frames, and controlling device. It builds on the basic security framework defined in IEEE 802.15.4.\n\nZigbee-style self-organizing ad-hoc digital radio networks were conceived in the 1990s. The IEEE 802.15.4-2003 Zigbee specification was ratified on December 14, 2004. The Zigbee Alliance announced availability of Specification 1.0 on June 13, 2005, known as the \"Zigbee 2004 Specification\".\n\nIn September 2006, the \"Zigbee 2006 Specification\" was announced, obsoleting the 2004 stack The 2006 specification replaces the Message/Key Value Pair structure used in the 2004 stack with a \"cluster library\". The library is a set of standardised commands, organised under groups known as clusters with names such as \"Smart Energy\", \"Home Automation\", \"Zigbee Light Link\".\n\nIn January 2017 Zigbee Alliance renamed the library to \"Dotdot\" and announced it as a new protocol to be represented by an emoticon \"||:\" They also announced it will now additionally run over other network types using Internet Protocol and will interconnect with other standards such as Thread.\n\nZigbee PRO, also known as Zigbee 2007, was finalized in 2007. A Zigbee PRO device may join and operate on a legacy Zigbee network and vice versa. Due to differences in routing options, Zigbee PRO devices must become non-routing Zigbee end devices (ZEDs) on a legacy Zigbee network, and legacy Zigbee devices must become ZEDs on a Zigbee PRO network. It operates on not only the 2.4 GHz band, but also the sub-GHz band.\n\nZigbee protocols are intended for embedded applications requiring low power consumption and tolerating low data rates. The resulting network will use very little power—individual devices must have a battery life of at least two years to pass Zigbee certification.\n\nTypical application areas include:\n\nZigbee is not for situations with high mobility among nodes. Hence, it is not suitable for tactical ad hoc radio networks in the battlefield, where high data rate and high mobility is present and needed. \n\nEstablished in 2002, the Zigbee Alliance is a group of companies that maintain and publish the Zigbee standard. The term Zigbee is a registered trademark of this group, not a single technical standard. The Alliance publishes application profiles that allow multiple OEM vendors to create interoperable products. The relationship between IEEE 802.15.4 and Zigbee is similar to that between IEEE 802.11 and the Wi-Fi Alliance.\n\nThe Zigbee Alliance has three levels of membership: Adopter, Participant, and Promoter. The Adopter members are allowed access to completed Zigbee specifications and standards, and the Participant members have voting rights, play a role in Zigbee development, and have early access to specifications and standards for product development.\n\nThe requirements for membership in the Zigbee alliance cause problems for Free Software developers because the annual fee conflicts with the GNU General Public Licence. The requirement for the developer to join the Zigbee Alliance similarly conflicts with most other free software licenses.\n\nThe Zigbee Alliance board has been asked to make their license compatible with GPL, but refused. Bluetooth has GPL licensed implementations.\n\nThe first Zigbee Application Profile, Home Automation, was announced November 2, 2007. The current list of application profiles either published, or in development are:\n\n\n\nThe Zigbee Smart Energy V2.0 specifications define an Internet protocol to monitor, control, inform and automate the delivery and use of energy and water. It is an enhancement of the Zigbee Smart Energy version 1 specifications. It adds services for plug-in electric vehicle charging, installation, configuration and firmware download, prepay services, user information and messaging, load control, demand response and common information and application profile interfaces for wired and wireless networks. It is being developed by partners including:\nZigbee Smart Energy relies on Zigbee IP, a network layer that routes standard IPv6 traffic over IEEE 802.15.4 using 6LoWPAN header compression.\n\nIn 2009, the RF4CE (Radio Frequency for Consumer Electronics) Consortium and Zigbee Alliance agreed to deliver jointly a standard for radio frequency remote controls. Zigbee RF4CE is designed for a broad range of consumer electronics products, such as TVs and set-top boxes. It promised many advantages over existing remote control solutions, including richer communication and increased reliability, enhanced features and flexibility, interoperability, and no line-of-sight barrier.\nThe Zigbee RF4CE specification lifts off some networking weight and does not support all the mesh features, which is traded for smaller memory configurations for lower cost devices, such as remote control of consumer electronics.\n\nWith the introduction of the second Zigbee RF4CE application profile in 2012 and increased momentum in MSO market, the Zigbee RF4CE team provides an overview on current status of the standard, applications, and future of the technology.\n\nThe radio design used by Zigbee has few analog stages and uses digital circuits wherever possible.\n\nThough the radios themselves are inexpensive, the Zigbee Qualification Process involves a full validation of the requirements of the physical layer. All radios derived from the same validated semiconductor mask set would enjoy the same RF characteristics. An uncertified physical layer that malfunctions could cripple the battery lifespan of other devices on a Zigbee network. Zigbee radios have very tight constraints on power and bandwidth. Thus, radios are tested with guidance given by Clause 6 of the 802.15.4-2006 Standard. Products that integrate the radio and microcontroller into a single module are available.\n\nThis standard specifies operation in the unlicensed 2.4 to 2.4835 GHz (worldwide), 902 to 928 MHz (Americas and Australia) and 868 to 868.6 MHz (Europe) ISM bands. Sixteen channels are allocated in the 2.4 GHz band, with each channel spaced 5 MHz apart, though using only 2 MHz of bandwidth. The radios use direct-sequence spread spectrum coding, which is managed by the digital stream into the modulator. Binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) is used in the 868 and 915 MHz bands, and offset quadrature phase-shift keying (OQPSK) that transmits two bits per symbol is used in the 2.4 GHz band.\n\nThe raw, over-the-air data rate is 250 kbit/s per channel in the 2.4 GHz band, 40 kbit/s per channel in the 915 MHz band, and 20 kbit/s in the 868 MHz band. The actual data throughput will be less than the maximum specified bit rate due to the packet overhead and processing delays. For indoor applications at 2.4 GHz transmission distance may be 10–20 m, depending on the construction materials, the number of walls to be penetrated and the output power permitted in that geographical location. Outdoors with line-of-sight, range may be up to 1500 m depending on power output and environmental characteristics. The output power of the radios is generally 0-20 dBm (1-100 mW).\n\nZigbee devices are of three kinds:\n\nThe current Zigbee protocols support beacon and non-beacon enabled networks. In non-beacon-enabled networks, an unslotted CSMA/CA channel access mechanism is used. In this type of network, Zigbee Routers typically have their receivers continuously active, requiring a more robust power supply. However, this allows for heterogeneous networks in which some devices receive continuously while others only transmit when an external stimulus is detected. The typical example of a heterogeneous network is a wireless light switch: The Zigbee node at the lamp may constantly receive, since it is connected to the mains supply, while a battery-powered light switch would remain asleep until the switch is thrown. The switch then wakes up, sends a command to the lamp, receives an acknowledgment, and returns to sleep. In such a network the lamp node will be at least a Zigbee Router, if not the Zigbee Coordinator; the switch node is typically a Zigbee End Device.\n\nIn beacon-enabled networks, the special network nodes called Zigbee Routers transmit periodic beacons to confirm their presence to other network nodes. Nodes may sleep between beacons, thus lowering their duty cycle and extending their battery life. Beacon intervals depend on data rate; they may range from 15.36 milliseconds to 251.65824 seconds at 250 kbit/s, from 24 milliseconds to 393.216 seconds at 40 kbit/s and from 48 milliseconds to 786.432 seconds at 20 kbit/s. However, low duty cycle operation with long beacon intervals requires precise timing, which can conflict with the need for low product cost.\n\nIn general, the Zigbee protocols minimize the time the radio is on, so as to reduce power use. In beaconing networks, nodes only need to be active while a beacon is being transmitted. In non-beacon-enabled networks, power consumption is decidedly asymmetrical: Some devices are always active while others spend most of their time sleeping.\n\nExcept for the Smart Energy Profile 2.0, Zigbee devices are required to conform to the IEEE 802.15.4-2003 Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area Network (LR-WPAN) standard. The standard specifies the lower protocol layers—the physical layer (PHY), and the Media Access Control portion of the data link layer (DLL). The basic channel access mode is \"carrier sense, multiple access/collision avoidance\" (CSMA/CA). That is, the nodes talk in the same way that humans converse; they briefly check to see that no one is talking before he or she start, with three notable exceptions. Beacons are sent on a fixed timing schedule and do not use CSMA. Message acknowledgments also do not use CSMA. Finally, devices in beacon-enabled networks that have low latency real-time requirements may also use Guaranteed Time Slots (GTS), which by definition do not use CSMA.\n\nThe software is designed to be easy to develop on small, inexpensive microprocessors.

Its capabilities and structure are those typically associated to such network layers, including routing. The Network Layer 's function is exactly as it sounds. It deals with network functions such as connecting, disconnecting, and setting up networks. It will add a network, allocate addresses, and add/remove certain devices. This layer makes use of star, mesh and tree topologies. It adds an interface to the application layer.\n\nOn the one hand, the \"data entity\" creates and manages network layer data units from the payload of the application-layer and performs routing according to the current topology. On the other hand, there is the layer \"control\", which is used to handle configuration of new devices and establish new networks: it can determine whether a neighboring device belongs to the network and discovers new neighbors and routers. The control can also detect the presence of a receiver, which allows direct communication and MAC synchronization.\n\nThe routing protocol used by the network layer is AODV, which has similar properties to Associativity-Based Routing (ABR). Unlike AODV, ABR was a patented routing protocol invented in 1994 at Cambridge University, England. AODV was a working IETF draft, which consistently added features from a variety of suggestions and sources over time. In AODV, to find the destination device, AODV broadcasts out a route request to all of its neighbors. The neighbors then broadcast the request to their neighbors and onward until the destination is reached. Once the destination is reached, it sends its route reply via unicast transmission following the lowest cost path back to the source. This approach of route discovery is exactly similar to those of ABR, except that ABR does not use sequence number or distance vectors. Once the source receives the reply, it will update its routing table for the destination address of the next hop in the path and the path cost.\n\nThe application layer is the highest-level layer defined by the specification and is the effective interface of the Zigbee system to its end users. It comprises the majority of components added by the Zigbee specification: both ZDO and its management procedures, together with application objects defined by the manufacturer, are considered part of this layer. This layer binds tables, sends messages between bound devices, manages group addresses, reassembles packets and also transports data. It is responsible for providing service to Zigbee device profiles.\n\nThe \"ZDO\" (Zigbee Device Object), a protocol in the Zigbee protocol stack, is responsible for overall device management, security keys, and policies. It is responsible for defining the role of a device as either coordinator or end device, as mentioned above, but also for the discovery of new (one-hop) devices on the network and the identification of their offered services. It may then go on to establish secure links with external devices and reply to binding requests accordingly.\n\nThe \"application support sublayer\" (APS) is the other main standard component of the layer, and as such it offers a well-defined interface and control services. It works as a bridge between the network layer and the other elements of the application layer: it keeps up-to-date binding tables in the form of a database, which can be used to find appropriate devices depending on the services that are needed and those the different devices offer. As the union between both specified layers, it also routes messages across the layers of the protocol stack.\n\n An application may consist of communicating objects which cooperate to carry out the desired tasks. The focus of Zigbee is to distribute work among many different devices which reside within individual Zigbee nodes which in turn form a network (said work will typically be largely local to each device, for instance, the control of each household appliance).\n\nThe collection of objects that form the network communicates using the facilities provided by APS, supervised by ZDO interfaces. The application layer data service follows a typical request-confirm/indication-response structure. Within a single device, up to 240 application objects can exist, numbered in the range 1-240. 0 is reserved for the ZDO data interface and 255 for broadcast; the 241-254 range is not currently in use but may be in the future.\n\nTwo services are available for application objects to use (in Zigbee 1.0):\n\nAddressing is also part of the application layer. A network node consists of an 802.15.4-conformant radio transceiver and one or more device descriptions (basically collections of attributes which can be polled or set, or which can be monitored through events). The transceiver is the base for addressing, and devices within a node are specified by an \"endpoint identifier\" in the range 1-240.\n\nFor applications to communicate, their comprising devices must use a common application protocol (types of messages, formats and so on); these sets of conventions are grouped in \"profiles\". Furthermore, binding is decided upon by matching input and output cluster identifiers, unique within the context of a given profile and associated to an incoming or outgoing data flow in a device. Binding tables contain source and destination pairs.\n\nDepending on the available information, device discovery may follow different methods. When the network address is known, the IEEE address can be requested using unicast communication. When it is not, petitions are broadcast (the IEEE address being part of the response payload). End devices will simply respond with the requested address while a network coordinator or a router will also send the addresses of all the devices associated with it.\n\nThis extended discovery protocol permits external devices to find out about devices in a network and the services that they offer, which endpoints can report when queried by the discovering device (which has previously obtained their addresses). Matching services can also be used.\n\nThe use of cluster identifiers enforces the binding of complementary entities using the binding tables, which are maintained by Zigbee coordinators, as the table must always be available within a network and coordinators are most likely to have a permanent power supply. Backups, managed by higher-level layers, may be needed by some applications. Binding requires an established communication link; after it exists, whether to add a new node to the network is decided, according to the application and security policies.\n\nCommunication can happen right after the association. \"Direct addressing\" uses both radio address and endpoint identifier, whereas indirect addressing uses every relevant field (address, endpoint, cluster, and attribute) and requires that they are sent to the network coordinator, which maintains associations and translates requests for communication. \"Indirect addressing\" is particularly useful to keep some devices very simple and minimize their need for storage. Besides these two methods, \"broadcast\" to all endpoints in a device is available, and \"group addressing\" is used to communicate with groups of endpoints belonging to a set of devices.\n\nAs one of its defining features, Zigbee provides facilities for carrying out secure communications, protecting establishment and transport of cryptographic keys, cyphering frames, and controlling devices. It builds on the basic security framework defined in IEEE 802.15.4. This part of the architecture relies on the correct management of symmetric keys and the correct implementation of methods and security policies.\n\nThe basic mechanism to ensure confidentiality is the adequate protection of all keying material. Trust must be assumed in the initial installation of the keys, as well as in the processing of security information. For an implementation to globally work, its general conformance to specified behaviors is assumed.\n\nKeys are the cornerstone of the security architecture; as such their protection is of paramount importance, and keys are never supposed to be transported through an insecure channel. A momentary exception to this rule occurs during the initial phase of the addition to the network of a previously unconfigured device. The Zigbee network model must take particular care of security considerations, as ad hoc networks may be physically accessible to external devices. Also the state of the working environment cannot be predicted.\n\nWithin the protocol stack, different network layers are not cryptographically separated, so access policies are needed, and conventional design assumed. The open trust model within a device allows for key sharing, which notably decreases potential cost. Nevertheless, the layer which creates a frame is responsible for its security. If malicious devices may exist, every network layer payload must be ciphered, so unauthorized traffic can be immediately cut off. The exception, again, is the transmission of the network key, which confers a unified security layer to the grid, to a new connecting device.\n\nZigbee uses 128-bit keys to implement its security mechanisms. A key can be associated either to a network, being usable by both Zigbee layers and the MAC sublayer, or to a link, acquired through pre-installation, agreement or transport. Establishment of link keys is based on a master key which controls link key correspondence. Ultimately, at least, the initial master key must be obtained through a secure medium (transport or pre-installation), as the security of the whole network depends on it. Link and master keys are only visible to the application layer. Different services use different one-way variations of the link key to avoid leaks and security risks.\n\nKey distribution is one of the most important security functions of the network. A secure network will designate one special device which other devices trust for the distribution of security keys: the trust center. Ideally, devices will have the center trust address and initial master key preloaded; if a momentary vulnerability is allowed, it will be sent as described above. Typical applications without special security needs will use a network key provided by the trust center (through the initially insecure channel) to communicate.\n\nThus, the trust center maintains both the network key and provides point-to-point security. Devices will only accept communications originating from a key supplied by the trust center, except for the initial master key. The security architecture is distributed among the network layers as follows:\n\nThe security levels infrastructure is based on CCM*, which adds encryption- and integrity-only features to CCM.\n\nAccording to a German computer magazine website, Zigbee Home Automation 1.2 is using fallback keys for encryption negotiation which are known and cannot be changed. This makes the encryption highly vulnerable.\n\nNetwork simulators, like ns2, OMNeT++, OPNET, and NetSim can be used to simulate IEEE 802.15.4 Zigbee networks.\n\nThese simulators come with open source C or C++ libraries for users to modify. This way users can determine the validity of new algorithms before hardware implementation.\n\n\n"}
