The method of levying the tithe of animals is indicated: they were counted singly; and every tenth one that passed under the rod became the tithe animal (Leviticus ).\n\nThe Rabbis inferred from Deuteronomy that each tithe was to be taken of every year's produce separately, whether of crops, of cattle, or of anything else subject to tithing (\"Sifre\", Deut. 105; \"Terumot\" i. 5; \"Rosh Hashanah\" 8a, 12b). Also they fixed a particular day to mark the beginning of the year for tithing. The new year's day for the tithing of animals (Rosh Hashanah L'Ma'sar Behemah) is the first of Elul according to Rabbi Meir, or the first of Tishrei according to Rabbi Eleazar and Rabbi Simeon (\"Rosh Hashanah\" ).\n\nThe Sages ordained that animals should not be tithed in the present era when the Temple is not standing.\n\n"}

The doctrine is often applied to situations involving standardized contracts or where the parties are of unequal bargaining power, but is applicable to other cases. The doctrine is not, however, directly applicable to situations where the language at issue is mandated by law, as is often the case with insurance contracts and bills of lading.\n\nThe reasoning behind this rule is to encourage the drafter of a contract to be as clear and explicit as possible and to take into account as many foreseeable situations as it can.\n\nAdditionally, the rule reflects the court's inherent dislike of standard-form take-it-or-leave-it contracts also known as contracts of adhesion (e.g., standard form insurance contracts for individual consumers, residential leases, etc.). The court perceives such contracts to be the product of bargaining between parties in unfair or uneven positions. To mitigate this perceived unfairness, legal systems apply the doctrine of \"contra proferentem\"; giving the benefit of any doubt in favor of the party upon whom the contract was foisted. Some courts when seeking a particular result will use \"contra proferentem\" to take a strict approach against insurers and other powerful contracting parties and go so far as to interpret terms of the contract in favor of the other party, even where the meaning of a term would appear clear and unambiguous on its face, although this application is disfavored.\n\n\"Contra proferentem\" also places the cost of losses on the party who was in the best position to avoid the harm. This is generally the person who drafted the contract. An example of this is the insurance contract mentioned above, which is a good example of an adhesion contract. There, the insurance company is the party completely in control of the terms of the contract and is generally in a better position to, for example, avoid contractual forfeiture. This is a longstanding principle: see, for example, California Civil Code §1654 (“In cases of uncertainty ... the language of a contract should be interpreted most strongly against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist\"), which was enacted in 1872. Numerous other states have also codified the rule.\n\nThe principle has also been codified in international instruments such as the UNIDROIT Principles and the Principles of European Contract Law.\n\n"}

Credit counseling is most often done by \"Credit counseling agencies\" that are empowered by contract to act on behalf of the debtor to negotiate with creditors to resolve debt that is beyond a debtor's ability to pay. Some of the agencies are non-profits that charge at no or non-fee rates, while others can be for-profit and include high fees. Regulations on credit counseling and Credit counseling agencies varies by country and sometimes within regions of the countries themselves. In the United States, individuals filing Chapter 13 bankruptcy are required to receive counseling.\n\nIn the United States, the National Foundation for Credit Counseling was established in 1951. The modern practice known as ‘‘credit counseling’’ was initiated by creditor banks and credit card companies during the mid-1960s to address the growing volume of personal bankruptcies.\n\nAlthough there is variation from country to country and even in regions within country, consumer debt is primarily made up of home loans, credit card debt and car loans. Credit counseling includes an array of services to address consumer debt that is not within the debtor's ability to pay. In addition to education, a popular credit counseling option is the ‘‘Debt management plan’’ (‘‘DMP’’, known in the United Kingdom as the Individual voluntary arrangement or \"IVA\"). In order to initiate a DMP, a consumer would authorize the credit counselor to contact each of the consumer’s unsecured creditors and negotiate with each creditor to lower the consumer’s monthly payment amount, to lower the interest rate, and to waive any outstanding late fees. The debt was then ‘‘consolidated’’ into a single payment.\n\nCredit counselors can sometimes negotiate debt relief, where part or whole of an individual debt is forgiven. Another option is Debt consolidation, in which one new loan replaces multiple unsecured credit debts. The Debt-snowball method is a budgeting approach that addresses debt systematically.\n\nGlobal criticism of credit counseling comes primarily from predatory practices that take advantage of debtors that are already struggling. These practices include failing to meet required standards, charging unlawful or unreasonable fees, failing to provide affordable solutions for consumers, and neglecting to make customers aware of free debt services available elsewhere.\n\nIn the United States, Credit counseling agencies are loosely regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the nation’s consumer protection agency, which can sue companies that have deceived consumers about the cost, nature, or benefits of their services. Different states may regulate DMPs individually and Attorneys General are empowered to protect state citizens from fraud. Two professional associations represent Credit counselors: the National Foundation for Credit Counseling and the Association of Independent Consumer Credit Counseling Agencies.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Financial Conduct Authority is responsible for the regulation of consumer credit and has established a Debt Management Plan Protocol. It can impose fines for improper conduct.\n\nElsewhere in the European Union, regulation and non-regulation of Credit counseling agencies and their approaches, including DMPs, are widely varied. In Sweden, guidelines for credit counseling are loosely provided by the Swedish Confederation of Professional Employees (TCO) and creditors are encouraged to use them in lieu of the court system. In Ireland, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) provides debt resolution information directly to debtors. In Latvia, a debt advisory company called LAKRA works with employers to assist indebted employees.\n\nThe Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC) advises Canadians to do their research and find a trustworthy organization and a qualified counsellor. They suggest making sure an agency is in good standing with a provincial or national association. They recommend looking carefully at the agency's advertising to see if it sounds too good to be true. Claims or misrepresentations to look out for can include repaying only a fraction of your debt, quickly fixing your credit score, or claiming to be part of a government program. They also suggest consumers inquire about an agency's services, costs, and counsellor qualifications. The FCAC has also warns Canadians to be careful of companies offering to help them pay off their debt or repair their credit. Things to watch out for include guarantees to solve debt problems and using high interest loans to pay off debt. Some of these companies also claim that they can file a consumer proposal on behalf of a consumer. However, the FCAC points out that only a qualified licensed insolvency trustee can help someone with a consumer proposal or bankruptcy.\n\nThe National Credit Regulator (NCR) was established as the regulator under the National Credit Act No. 34 of 2005 (The Act) and is responsible for the regulation of the South African credit industry. It is tasked with carrying out education, research, policy development, registration of industry participants, investigation of complaints, and ensuring the enforcement of the Act. The NCR is also tasked with the registration of credit providers, credit bureau and debt counsellors; and with the enforcement of compliance with the Act. Debt Counselling was introduced and enforced in 2007. This enabled over-indebted consumers to seek relief in accordance to the National Credit Act.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "27496730", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27496730", "title": "Cy-près doctrine in English law", "text": "Cy-près doctrine in English law\n\nThe cy-pres doctrine in English law is an element of trusts law dealing with charitable trusts. The doctrine provides that when such a trust has failed because its purposes are either impossible or cannot be fulfilled, the High Court of Justice or Charity Commission can make an order redirecting the trust's funds to the nearest possible purpose. For charities with a worth under £5,000 and no land, the trustees (by a two-thirds majority) may make the decision to redirect the trust's funds. The doctrine was initially an element of ecclesiastical law, coming from the Norman French \"cy près comme possible\" (as close as possible), but similar and possibly ancestral provisions have been found in Roman law, both in the \"Corpus Juris Civilis\" and later Byzantine law.\n\nTrusts where the doctrine is applicable are divided into two groups; those with subsequent failure, where the trust's purpose has failed after it came into operation, and initial failure, where the trust's purposes are immediately invalid. Subsequent failure cases simply require the redirection of the funds to the nearest possible purpose, since there is no question of allowing the settlor's next of kin to inherit the money. Initial failure cases, however, require not just a decision on whether the purpose has failed, but also on whether the funds should be subject to cy-près or returned to the estate in a resulting trust. This is decided based on the charitable intention of the settlor, something determined on the facts of each individual case.\n\nThe cy-près doctrine is the idea that, where a charitable trust's purposes are impossible or cannot be fulfilled for whatever reason, the funds should be reapplied to purposes as close as possible to the trust's original goals. This is done through a formal application by the trustees, either to the High Court of Justice or the Charity Commission. This doctrine originated in ecclesiastical law, the name coming as a contraction of the Norman French \"cy près comme possible\" (as close as possible), It was originally justified in an ecclesiastical way; charitable gifts were provided to secure entry into heaven, and if the charitable gift failed, this would not be guaranteed. If it was re-purposed, however, entry would be granted. The local bishop, therefore, would usually simply apply the gift to the nearest possible purpose to the testator's original goals.\n\nSome evidence suggests that the doctrine descends from Roman law. The \"Corpus Juris Civilis\" mentions a process that redirected money collected to celebrate a person's life in some way that violated law to a purpose within the law. It also gives a similar justification: \"[I]t would be unjust that the amount which [the testator] has destined to that end should revert to the heirs. Therefore, let an investigation be made to ascertain how the trust may be employed so that the memory of the deceased may be preserved in some other and lawful manner.\" The Byzantine Empire used a system similar to cy-près when dealing with \"piae causae\", charitable corporations, whereby if the corporation fell its possessions were to be transferred to the Papal treasury and spent on a purpose as close as possible to that of the original corporation.\n\nPrior to the Charities Act 1960, situations where the cy-pres doctrine applied were limited to cases where the trust's purpose was either impossible or impracticable. The 1960 Act, however, provides in Section 13(1) (now part of the Charities Act 1993) that cy-près can apply where the original purposes have: \nThis definition was amended by the Charities Act 2006 to replace \"the spirit of the gift\" with \"the appropriate considerations,\" which are defined as \"(on the one hand) the spirit of the gift concerned, and (on the other) the social and economic circumstances prevailing at the time of the proposed alteration of the original purposes\". In the case of extremely small charitable trusts (where the charity has an income of less than £5,000 and holds no land) the trustees may agree by a two-thirds majority to transfer the property to another charity, without involving the High Court or Commission. This is contained in Sections 74-5 of the 1993 Act. Once the decision is reached, public notice must be given, and the Commission informed. Cy-près powers are now enacted in the Charities Act 2011.\n\nThe cy-près doctrine applies to two types of situations: subsequent failures and initial failures. Subsequent failures are where money has already been applied to a charitable purpose, and that purpose has failed. It does not allow the next of kin of the original donor to recover any money, as said in \"Re Wright\": \"Once money has been effectually dedicated to charity, whether in pursuance of a general or a particular charitable intent, the testator's next of kin or residuary legatees are forever excluded\". The courts instead simply determine whether or not the reason for failure falls within Section 13, based on the basic intention underlying the original gift.\n\nCases of initial failure are where, rather than an established charitable trust failing, a gift has failed at the moment of its creation by having an invalid purpose. This raises different questions, as it is a matter of deciding \"has the original charitable gift failed, and, if it has, can the money be applied cy-près or must it go on resulting trust to the settlor's estate\"?\n\nWhen deciding if a gift has failed, attention is first turned to the wording of the trust instrument. The terms of such documents are taken literally; if a particular organisation or purpose is given, the settlor's intention is considered to be no wider or narrower than this. A different approach is used when dealing with cases like \"Re Faraker\", which dealt with a situation where the charity named in the gift had been amalgamated with others. The Court of Appeal held that the amalgamated charities were entitled to the gift, since the charity named effectively continued as part of the amalgamated one. Farwell LJ wrote that, \"In all these cases one has to consider not so much the means to the end as the charitable end which is in view, and so long as the charitable end is well established the means are only machinery, and no alteration of the machinery can destroy the charitable trust for the benefit of which the machinery is provided.\"\n\nIn \"Re Finger\", Goff J made a distinction between gifts to incorporated bodies and gifts to unincorporated bodies. When a gift is to an unincorporated body, it must be treated, whatever the wording, as a gift to that body's purpose. This is because unincorporated bodies cannot possess things. If the body has ceased to exist but the purpose continues, the gift has not failed. Incorporated bodies on the other hand can possess property, and as such, as said by Buckley J in \"Re Vernon's Will Trust\", \"A bequest to a corporate body ... takes effect simply as a gift to that body beneficially, unless there are circumstances which show that the recipient is to take the gift as a trustee.\"\n\nOnce it has been decided that the gift has failed, the courts consider whether the gift may be applied cy-près. The gift must show charitable intention; that the settlor intended not just a gift to a particular (failed) purpose or organisation, but a more general charitable intention. This is something decided on the facts of each individual case, but some general principles are in place; external evidence is admissible to override any \"prima facie\" interpretation that a gift is for non-charitable purposes, as in \"Re Satterthwaite's Will Trusts\", and charitable intention can be found in cases where a non-existent charity is the recipient of the settlor's gift, as in \"Re Harwood\".\n\n"}

{"id": "26671572", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26671572", "title": "Dishonest assistance", "text": "Dishonest assistance\n\nDishonest assistance, or knowing assistance, is a type of third party liability under English trust law. It is usually seen as one of two liabilities established in \"Barnes v Addy,\" the other one being knowing receipt. To be liable for dishonest assistance, there must be a breach of trust or fiduciary duty by someone other than the defendant, the defendant must have helped that person in the breach, and the defendant must have a dishonest state of mind. The liability itself is well established, but the mental element of dishonesty is subject to considerable controversy which sprang from the House of Lords case \"Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley\".\n\nIt is a common belief that dishonest or knowing assistance originates from Lord Selbourne's judgment in \"Barnes v Addy\":\n\nAs can be seen, the judgment laid down two heads of liability: one based on receipt of trust property (knowing receipt) and the other on assisting with knowledge in a dishonest and fraudulent design (knowing assistance).\n\nLord Selbourne's statement has been heavily criticized, particularly on the requirement that the defaulting fiduciary / trustee has to be dishonest or fraudulent. A commentator noted that \"Fyler v Fyler\" and \"AG v The Corporation of Leicester\", two decisions on knowing assistance in the 1840s which predated \"Barnes v Addy\", did not mention the moral quality of the breach induced or assisted at all.\n\nAnother debate was regarding the type of knowledge that would suffice to impose liability. Peter Gibson J in \"Baden v Société Générale\" identified 5 categories of knowledge which was subject to much debate and led the courts into \"tortuous convolutions\".\n\nThe prevalent view is that liability for dishonest assistance is secondary. Therefore, the liability of the assistant is premised on that of the defaulting fiduciary / trustee and he/she will be jointly and severally liable with the fiduciary / trustee whom he/she assisted. However, Charles Mitchell recognized possible difficulties with this categorization: firstly, secondary liability means that the dishonest assistant will be liable for the disgorgement gains of the defaulting fiduciary / trustee, while the fiduciary / trustee will not be liable for secret profits of the dishonest assistant; secondly, the assessment of exemplary damages against the dishonest assistant will be based on that of the fiduciary / trustee which can be undesirable.\n\nThere are also views that liability for dishonest assistance should be primary. However, such views have yet to receive judicial endorsement.\n\nDishonest assistants have been frequently described by courts as constructive trustees. However, such classification is not without difficulty: dishonest assistance is often imposed even if there is no obviously identifiable property subject to the trust; also, in many cases of dishonest assistance property has reached the hands of innocent third parties who may not be under any obligation to restore it. Some commentators have sought to explain this on the basis that there is a type of constructive trust which can arise even if there is no identifiable trust property.\n\nHowever, the prevalent view is that dishonest assistance is a personal liability that does not result in an imposition of constructive trust. This view has the support of Lord Millett who remarked in \"Dubai Aluminium Co v Salaam\":\n\nThe trustee or fiduciary of the claimant must be liable for a breach of trust or fiduciary duty. It is sufficient if the trust in question is a resulting trust or constructive trust. \n\nPreviously, it was thought that the dishonest assistant would not be liable unless the defaulting trustee was also dishonest or fraudulent, but \"Royal Brunei Airlines v Tan\" confirmed that there is no such requirement in English law. However, the requirement of dishonest or fraudulent design on the part of the defaulting fiduciary / trustee is still part of the law in Australia.\n\nWhether a breach of trust should be required at all has been queried by a commentator, since no breach is required for the analogous tort of interference with contractual relations and if the fiduciary reasonably relies on the probity and competence of the dishonest assistant, the claimant would be left with no remedy.\n\nThis element is a question of fact as to whether the defendant has been accessory to the misfeasance or breach of trust in question.\n\nHistorically in England, liability would be imposed on persons who assisted in a breach of trust or fiduciary duty \"with knowledge\". Hence its previous name of \"knowing assistance\". It should be noted that knowledge is still the cornerstone of the liability in Australia and Canada. The modern English terminology emerged in \"Royal Brunei Airlines v Tan\" in which the Privy Council rejected knowledge as an element of the liability and replaced it with a requirement for dishonesty. After opting for the imposition of fault-based liability, Lord Nicholls said,\n\nHis Lordship went on to articulate a test for dishonesty, which is generally perceived to be an objective test with some subjective characteristics: \n\nHence, the conduct of the defendant is to be assessed according to an objective standard of dishonesty in light of the actual knowledge of the defendant. When undertaking such exercise, the court will also have regard to personal attributes of the defendant, such as his experience and intelligence, and the reason why he acted as he did. His Lordship then gave a few examples of dishonesty, such as deception, knowingly taking the property of others, participation in a transaction in light of knowledge that it involves a misapplication of trust assets, willful blindness etc.\n\nThe issue was later reconsidered in \"Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley\" in the House of Lords, which unfortunately returned a different answer. The majority in that case held that Lord Nicholls in \"Royal Brunei\" meant to say that, for a person to be held liable as an accessory to a breach of trust, he had to have acted dishonestly by the ordinary standards of reasonable and honest people and have been himself aware that by those standards he was acting dishonestly. This became known as the \"combined test\", namely a standard which requires both subjective and objective states of mind. Lord Hutton's reason for adopting the combined test is that a finding by a judge that a defendant has been dishonest is a grave finding, and it is particularly grave against a professional man. Therefore, in his view, a higher level of blameworthiness is required to impose liability in dishonest assistance.\n\nLord Millett delivered a dissenting judgment, maintaining that \"Royal Brunei\" decided that the test of dishonesty is objective, although account must be taken of subjective considerations such as the defendant’s experience and intelligence and his actual state of knowledge at the relevant time. But it is not necessary that he should actually have appreciated that he was acting dishonestly; it is sufficient that he was. The question is whether an honest person would appreciate that what he was doing was wrong or improper, not whether the defendant himself actually appreciated this. His Lordship gave 3 reasons for this:\n\nWhat Lord Hutton said in \"Twinsectra\" has now been reinterpreted and restated by the Privy Council in \"Barlow Clowes International v Eurotrust International\". In that case, Lord Hoffmann reaffirmed the objective test, i.e. the one maintained by Lord Millett in \"Twinsectra\", as the correct test for dishonesty. His Lordship interpreted Lord Hutton's reference to 'what he knows would offend normally acceptable standards of honest conduct' as meaning only that his knowledge of the transaction had to be such as to render his participation contrary to normally acceptable standards of honest conduct. His Lordship said that it is not necessary for the defendant to have reflections what those normally acceptable standards of honest conduct were. \n\nSubsequently, the lower English courts have adopted the test laid down in \"Barlow Clowes\", although theoretically it is not open to them to refuse to follow the House of Lords decision in \"Twinsectra\". In \"Abou-Rahmah v Abacha\" before the English Court of Appeal, Arden LJ endorsed \"Barlow Clowes\" as representing the current English law for 4 reasons:\nHowever, the other two judges, Pill LJ and Rix LJ, refused to get drawn into the controversy as it was unnecessary to decide on the proper test for dishonesty to dispose of the appeal. In fact, some commentators have suggested that Pill LJ seems to support the combined test in \"Twinsectra\", although he did not make it explicit.\n\nIn \"AG of Zambia v Meer Care & Desai\", Peter Smith J at the Chancery Division opined that the question of objective/subjective test is an over elaboration and endorsed the test set out in \"Royal Brunei\", which he regards as another way of posing the jury question \"was the defendant dishonest\". He disagreed with Lord Hutton's view in Twinsectra that Lord Millett was articulating a purely objective test. He also regarded Lord Hutton's justification for the combined test, that dishonesty is a grave finding against professionals, as erroneous since it is no less grave for a non professional to be accused of dishonesty and there had been plenty of dishonest professionals.\n\nThe test in \"Royal Brunei\" and \"Barlow Clowes\" has been accepted as the law in New Zealand in the New Zealand Court of Appeal case \"US International Marketing Ltd v National Bank of NZ Ltd\". However, one of the three judges (Tipping J) applied a reasonable person test as opposed to the honest person test in determining the question of dishonesty.\n\nIn \"Agip (Africa) Ltd v Jackson\" and \"Twinsectra v Yardley\", Lord Millett remarked that it is not necessary that the dishonest assistant should be aware of the identity of the victim or nature of the breach and knowledge that the money is not at the free disposal of the assisted person suffices to impose liability. Similarly, in \"Barlow Clowes\", Lord Hoffmann said it is unnecessary for the dishonest assistant to know of the existence of breach or the facts; it is enough if he /she knows or suspects he is assisting in misappropriation of money without knowing money is held on trust.\n\nWhat level of suspicion suffice to trigger the liability continues to trouble the courts. In \"Abou-Rahmah\", Arden LJ opined that the dishonest assistant is not dishonest if he only has general suspicions about impropriety as opposed to particular suspicions regarding specific transactions. However, Rix LJ thought otherwise and said that general suspicion is enough to trigger the liability.\n\nTraditionally, dishonest assistance and knowing receipt are seen as two distinct heads of liability: one is fault based, while the other is receipt based. However, there has been academic discussion as to whether they can be grouped together. Charles Mitchell proposes that if we adopt Peter Birk’s view regarding knowing receipt (that knowing receipt can be based on unjust enrichment as well as fault), there is a strong case for treating liability for dishonest assistance and fault-based knowing receipt as aspects of a single equitable wrong of interfering with another’s equitable rights – a wrong he called “equitable conversion”. Furthermore, Lord Nicholls has proposed extrajudicially that dishonesty is one of the bases for the liability for knowing receipt and that dishonest receipt can be grouped with dishonest assistance into dishonest participation in breach of trust.\n\n\n\n"}

Once pre-screened, passengers may reuse the ESTA approval for two years, although they may still need to complete the I-94W paper form for land entry.\n\nESTA adds a requirement for pre-authorization to the existing Visa Waiver Program.\n\nSince January 20, 2010, airlines have been forced (through fines) to require ESTA at check in.\n\nBefore September 8, 2010, ESTA was available for free from the official government websites. Since then, the Travel Promotion Act introduced a charge of $14. This is made up of $10 which goes to the Corporation for Travel Promotion and a $4 fee levied by the CBP for administration costs. The EU Ambassador to the United States John Bruton argued that it is illogical to think tourist numbers will go up if they are charged to enter the country.\nThe charge has also been described by critics in the European Parliament as little more than a way to fund advertisements for United States tourism.\n\nAs of November 2017, 38 countries participate in the Visa Waiver Program:\nVisitors may stay for 90 days in the United States which also includes the time spent in Canada, Mexico, Bermuda, or the islands in the Caribbean if the arrival was through the United States. The ESTA is only required if arriving by air or cruise ship. It is not required if arriving on a ferry between British Columbia (Vancouver and Victoria) and Washington State. If a passenger is arriving by land ESTA is not required.\n\nESTA holders who are dual citizens of Iran, Iraq, Sudan and Syria had their ESTAs revoked in January 2016, and will be required to apply for a regular tourist visa at a US foreign mission. ESTA holders who have traveled to Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria or Yemen on or after 1 March 2011 will not have their ESTAs revoked, but will be refused entry if their travel is discovered by the CBP on arrival unless they qualify for a waiver. The Secretary of Homeland Security may waive these restrictions if he determines that such a waiver is in the law enforcement or national security interests of the United States. Such waivers will be granted only on a case-by-case basis. As a general matter, categories of travelers who may be eligible for a waiver include individuals who traveled to these countries on behalf of international organizations, regional organizations, and sub-national governments on official duty; on behalf of a humanitarian NGO on official duty; or as a journalist for reporting purposes.\n\nThe leaders of the 27 EU member states agreed in their Bratislava Declaration and Roadmap on September 16, 2016, to set up an analogous EU Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS).\n\nThe U.S. Government recommends that travellers go online to submit an authorization request at least three days (72 hours) before travelling to the United States. This is not a requirement, and about 99% of applications are approved in 5 seconds. However, if a traveller is not eligible for visa-free travel, he or she will need to apply for a visa at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate, which is a substantially lengthier process that may require an interview with a U.S. Consular officer. As a result, opponents claim the new rules will delay last-minute business travel.\n\nEach travel authorization under ESTA can be valid for up to two years. However, a Visa Waiver Program traveler must obtain a new ESTA authorization if he or she is issued a new passport, or changes his or her name, gender or country of citizenship. In addition, a traveler must obtain a new ESTA authorization if any answer to the ESTA application eligibility questions changes.\n\nEntry under the Visa Waiver Program is only valid for a combined maximum stay in the USA and its surrounding countries of ninety days. Admission period cannot be extended under the program. If a longer stay is intended, a visa is required.\n\nESTA does not guarantee entry to the United States. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers make final determination of admissibility (entry) to the United States and may cancel/deny ESTA at any time during travel.\n\nSome websites offer to complete ESTA applications for a fee, often many times more than the required $14 fee charged by the US Government. Access and application through the official U.S. Government website are available to any passengers/visitors to the U.S. who qualify under the ESTA program. Prevention of such \"ESTA fee scams\" was made more difficult when the mandatory US Government fee was imposed, as previous public education efforts focused on getting out the message that ESTA applications were free of charge and anybody requesting payment was an unauthorized third-party.\n\nEven if one of the third-party websites is used, passengers themselves still have to complete the same form. Concerns have been raised that third-party sites could be used for identity theft, credit card fraud, or the distribution of malware.\n\nAdvertisements for paid services appeared at the top of Google searches for many years, until Google took steps to prevent this in most cases in late 2018.\n\n\n"}

In this context, the term \"environmental impact assessment\" (EIA) is usually used when applied to actual projects by individuals or companies and the term \"strategic environmental assessment\" (SEA) applies to policies, plans and programmes most often proposed by organs of state. Environmental assessments may be governed by rules of administrative procedure regarding public participation and documentation of decision making, and may be subject to judicial review. <section end=overview />\n\nThe purpose of the assessment is to ensure that decision makers consider the environmental impacts when deciding whether or not to proceed with a project. The International Association for Impact Assessment (IAIA) defines an environmental impact assessment as \"the process of identifying, predicting, evaluating and mitigating the biophysical, social, and other relevant effects of development proposals prior to major decisions being taken and commitments made\". EIAs are unique in that they do not require adherence to a predetermined environmental outcome, but rather they require decision makers to account for environmental values in their decisions and to justify those decisions in light of detailed environmental studies and public comments on the potential environmental impacts.\n\nEnvironmental impact assessments commenced in the 1960s, as part of increasing environmental awareness. EIAs involved a technical evaluation intended to contribute to more objective decision making. In the United States, environmental impact assessments obtained formal status in 1969, with enactment of the National Environmental Policy Act. EIAs have been used increasingly around the world. The number of \"Environmental Assessments\" filed every year \"has vastly overtaken the number of more rigorous Environmental Impact Statements (EIS).\" An Environmental Assessment is a \"mini-EIS designed to provide sufficient information to allow the agency to decide whether the preparation of a full-blown Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is necessary.\"\nEIA is an activity that is done to find out the impact that would be done before development will occur.\n\nGeneral and industry specific assessment methods are available including:\n\n\nAt the end of the project, an audit evaluates the accuracy of the EIA by comparing actual to predicted impacts. The objective is to make future EIAs more valid and effective. Two primary considerations are:\n\nAudits can be performed either as a rigorous assessment of the null hypothesis or with a simpler approach comparing what actually occurred against the predictions in the EIA document.\n\nAfter an EIA, the precautionary and polluter pays principles may be applied to decide whether to reject, modify or require strict liability or insurance coverage to a project, based on predicted harms.\n\nThe Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol is a sector specific method for checking the quality of Environmental and Social assessments and management plans.\n\nThe history of EIA in Australia could be linked to the enactment of the U.S. National Environment Policy Act (NEPA) in 1970, which made the preparation of environmental impact statements a requirement. In Australia, one might say that the EIA procedures were introduced at a State Level prior to that of the Commonwealth (Federal), with a majority of the states having divergent views to the Commonwealth. One of the pioneering states was New South Wales, whose State Pollution Control Commission issued EIA guidelines in 1974. At a Commonwealth (i.e. Federal) level, this was followed by passing of the \"Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974\" (Cth) in 1974. The \"Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999\" (Cth) (EPBC Act) superseded the \"Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974\" (Cth) and is the current central piece for EIA in Australia on a Commonwealth (i.e. Federal) level. An important point to note is that this federal legislation does not override the validity of the States or Territories environmental and development assessments and approvals; rather the EPBC Act runs as a parallel to the State/Territory Systems. Overlap between federal and state requirements is addressed via bilateral agreements or one-off accreditation of state processes, as provided for in the EPBC Act.\n\nThe EPBC Act provides a legal framework to protect and manage nationally and internationally important flora, fauna, ecological communities and heritage places-defined in the EPBC Act as matters of ‘National Environmental Significance’. Following are the nine matters of ‘National Environmental Significance’ to which the EPBC Act applies:\n\n\nIn addition to this, the EPBC Act aims at providing a streamlined national assessment and approval process for activities. These activities could be by the Commonwealth, or its agents, anywhere in the world or activities on Commonwealth land; and activities that are listed as having a ‘significant impact’ on matters of ‘national environment significance'.\n\nThe EPBC Act comes into play when a person (a ‘proponent') wants an action (often called a ‘proposal’ or ‘project’) assessed for environmental impacts under the EPBC Act, he or she must refer the project to the Department of the Environment and Energy (Commonwealth). This ‘referral’ is then released to the public, as well as relevant state, territory and Commonwealth ministers, for comment on whether the project is likely to have a significant impact on matters of national environmental significance. The Department of the Environment and Energy assess the process and makes recommendation to the minister or the delegate for the feasibility. The final discretion on the decision remains of the minister, which is not solely based on matters of ‘national environmental significance’ but also the consideration of social and economic impact of the project.\n\nThe Australian Government Minister for the Environment and Energy cannot intervene in a proposal if it has no significant impact on one of the eight matters of ‘national environmental significance’ despite the fact that there may be other undesirable environmental impacts. This is primarily due to the division of powers between the States and the Federal government and due to which the Australian Government environment minister cannot overturn a state decision.\n\nThere are strict civil and criminal penalties for the breach of EPBC Act. Depending on the kind of breach, civil penalty (maximum) may go up to $550,000 for an individual and $5.5 million for a body corporate, or for criminal penalty (maximum) of seven years imprisonment and/or penalty of $46,200.\n\nEIA provisions within Ministerial Authorities in the ACT are found in the Chapters 7 and 8 of the \"Planning and Development Act 2007\" (ACT). EIA in ACT was previously administered with the help of Part 4 of the Land (Planning and Environment) Act 1991 (Land Act) and Territory Plan (plan for land-use).\nNote that some EIA may occur in the ACT on Commonwealth land under the EPBC Act (Cth). Further provisions of the \"Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988\" (Cth) may also be applicable particularly to national land and \"designated areas\".\n\nIn New South Wales, the \"Environment Planning and Assessment Act 1979\" (EP&A Act) establishes two pathways for EIA. The first is under Division 5.2 of the EP&A Act, which provides for EIA of 'State Significant Infrastructure' projects (from June 2011, this Part replaced the previous Part 3A, which previously covered EIA of major projects). The second is under Part 4 of the EP&A Act dealing with development assessments for local, regional, and State Significant Developments (other than State Significant Infrastructure).\n\nThe EIA process in Northern Territory is chiefly administered under the Environmental Assessment Act (EAA). Although EAA is the primary tool for EIA in Northern Territory, there are further provisions for proposals in the Inquiries Act 1985 (NT).\n\nThere are four main EIA processes in Queensland. Firstly, under the Integrated Planning Act 1997 (IPA) for development projects other than mining. Secondly, under the Chapter 3 of the \"Environmental Protection Act 1994\" (Qld) (EP Act) for some mining and petroleum activities. Thirdly, under the \"State Development and Public Works Organisation Act 1971\" (Qld) (State Development Act) for ‘significant projects’. Finally, under the \"Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999\" (Cth) for ‘controlled actions’.\n\nSouth Australia (SA)\n\nThe local governing tool for EIA in South Australia is the \"Development Act 1993\" (SA). There are three levels of assessment possible under the Act in the form of an environment impact statement (EIS), a public environmental report (PER) or a Development Report (DR).\n\nIn Tasmania, an integrated system of legislation is used to govern development and approval process, this system is a mixture of the E\"nvironmental Management and Pollution Control Act 1994\" (Tas) (EMPC Act), \"Land Use Planning and Approvals Act 1993\" (Tas) (LUPA Act), \"State Policies and Projects Act 1993\" (Tas) (SPPA), and \"Resource Management and Planning Appeals Tribunal Act 1993\" (Tas).\n\nThe EIA process in Victoria is intertwined with the \"Environment Effects Act 1978\" (Vic) and the Ministerial Guidelines for Assessment of Environmental Effects (made under the s 10 of the EE Act).\n\nPart 4 of the \"Environmental Protection Act 1986\" (WA) provides the legislative framework for the EIA process in Western Australia. The EPA Act oversees the planning and development proposals and assesses their likely impacts on the environment.\n\nIn \"Friends of the Oldman River Society v. Canada (Minister of Transportation)\", La Forest J of the Supreme Court of Canada described environmental impact assessment in terms of the proper scope of federal jurisdiction with respect to environments matters,\nSupreme Court Justice La Forest cited , \"The basic concepts behind environmental assessment are simply stated: (1) early identification and evaluation of all potential environmental consequences of a proposed undertaking; (2) decision making that both guarantees the adequacy of this process and reconciles, to the greatest extent possible, the proponent’s development desires with environmental protection and preservation.\"\n\nLa Forest referred to and who described \"...environmental assessments as a planning tool with both an information-gathering and a decision-making component\" that provide \"...an objective basis for granting or denying approval for a proposed development.\"\n\nJustice La Forest addressed his concerns about the implications of Bill C-45 regarding public navigation rights on lakes and rivers that would contradict previous cases.\n\nThe Canadian Environmental Assessment Act 2012 (CEAA 2012) \"and its regulations establish the legislative basis for the federal practice of environmental assessment in most regions of Canada.\" CEAA 2012 came into force July 6, 2012 and replaces the former \"Canadian Environmental Assessment Act\" (1995). EA is defined as a planning tool to identify, understand, assess and mitigate, where possible, the environmental effects of a project.\n\nEnvironmental Lawyer Dianne Saxe argued that the CEAA 2012 \"allows the federal government to create mandatory timelines for assessments of even the largest and most important projects, regardless of public opposition.\" \n\nOn 3 August 2012 the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency nine \"designated projects\" with their timelines: Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipeline Joint Review Panel (JRP) 18 months; Marathon Platinum Group Metals and Copper Mine Project (JRP): 13 months; Site C Clean Energy Project (JRP) 8.5 months; Deep Geologic Repository Project (JRP) 17 months; Enbridge Northern Gateway Project (JRP) 18 months; Jackpine Mine Expansion Project (JRP) 11.5 months; Pierre River Mine Project: 8 months; New Prosperity Gold-Copper Mine Project (JRP) 7.5 months; Frontier Oil Sands Mine Project (JRP) 8.5 months; EnCana/Cenovus Shallow Gas Infill Project (JRP) 5 months.\n\nSaxe compares these timelines with environmental assessments for the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline. Thomas R. Berger, Royal Commissioner of the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline Inquiry (9 May 1977), worked extremely hard to ensure that industrial development on Aboriginal people's land resulted in benefits to those indigenous people.\n\nOn 22 April 2013, Official Opposition Environment critic Megan Leslie issued a statement claiming that the federal government's recent changes to \"fish habitat protection, the Navigable Waters Protection Act and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act\", along with gutting existing laws and making cuts to science and research, \"will be disastrous, not only for the environment, but also for Canadians’ health and economic prosperity.\" On 26 September 2012, Leslie argued that with the changes to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act that came into effect 6 July 2012, \"seismic testing, dams, wind farms and power plants\" no longer required any federal environmental assessment. She also claimed that because the CEAA 2012—which she claimed was rushed through Parliament—dismantled the CEAA 1995, the Oshawa ethanol plant project would no longer have a full federal environmental assessment. Mr. Peter Kent (Minister of the Environment) explained that the CEAA 2012 \"provides for the Government of Canada and the Environmental Assessment Agency to focus on the large and most significant projects that are being proposed across the country.\" The 2,000 to 3,000-plus smaller screenings that were in effect under CEAA 1995 became the \"responsibility of lower levels of government but are still subject to the same strict federal environmental laws.\" Anne Minh-Thu Quach, MP for Beauharnois—Salaberry, QC, argued that the mammoth budget bill dismantled 50 years of environmental protection without consulting Canadians about the \"colossal changes they are making to environmental assessments.\" She claimed that the federal government is entering into \"limited consultations, by invitation only, months after the damage was done.\"\n\nThe Environmental Impact Assessment Law (EIA Law) requires that an environmental impact assessment be completed prior to project construction. However, if a developer completely ignores this requirement and builds a project without submitting an environmental impact statement, the only penalty is that the environmental protection bureau (EPB) may require the developer to do a make-up environmental assessment. If the developer does not complete this make-up assessment within the designated time, only then is the EPB authorized to fine the developer. Even so, the possible fine is capped at a maximum of about US$25,000, a fraction of the overall cost of most major projects. The lack of more stringent enforcement mechanisms has resulted in a significant percentage of projects not completing legally required environmental impact assessments prior to construction.\n\nChina's State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) used the legislation to halt 30 projects in 2004, including three hydro-power plants under the Three Gorges Project Company. Although one month later (Note as a point of reference, that the typical EIA for a major project in the USA takes one to two years.), most of the 30 halted projects resumed their construction, reportedly having passed the environmental assessment, the fact that these key projects' construction was ever suspended was notable.\n\nA joint investigation by SEPA and the Ministry of Land and Resources in 2004 showed that 30–40% of the mining construction projects went through the procedure of environment impact assessment as required, while in some areas only 6–7% did so. This partly explains why China has witnessed so many mining accidents in recent years.\n\nSEPA alone cannot guarantee the full enforcement of environmental laws and regulations, observed Professor Wang Canfa, director of the centre to help environmental victims at China University of Political Science and Law. In fact, according to Wang, the rate of China's environmental laws and regulations that are actually enforced is estimated at barely 10%.\n\nEnvironmental Impact Assessment (EIA)\nEIA is implemented in Egypt under the umbrella of the Ministry of state for environmental affairs. The Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA) is responsible for the EIA services.\n\nIn June 1997, the responsibility of Egypt's first full-time Minister of State for Environmental Affairs was assigned as stated in the Presidential Decree no.275/1997. From thereon, the new ministry has focused, in close collaboration with the national and international development partners, on defining environmental policies, setting priorities and implementing initiatives within a context of sustainable development.\n\nAccording to the Law 4/1994 for the Protection of the Environment, the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA) was restructured with the new mandate to substitute the institution initially established in 1982. At the central level, EEAA represents the executive arm of the Ministry.\n\nThe purpose of EIA is to ensure the protection and conservation of the environment and natural resources including human health aspects against uncontrolled development. The long-term objective is to ensure a sustainable economic development that meets present needs without compromising future generations ability to meet their own needs. EIA is an important tool in the integrated environmental management approach.\n\nEIA must be performed for new establishments or projects and for expansions or renovations of existing establishments according to the Law for the Environment.\nA wide range of instruments exist in the Environmental policy of the European Union. Among them the European Union has established a mix of mandatory and discretionary procedures to assess environmental impacts. European Union Directive (85/337/EEC) on Environmental Impact Assessments (known as the \"EIA Directive\") was first introduced in 1985 and was amended in 1997. The directive was amended again in 2003, following EU signature of the 1998 Aarhus Convention, and once more in 2009. The initial Directive of 1985 and its three amendments have been codified in Directive 2011/92/EU of 13 December 2011.\nIn 2001, the issue was enlarged to the assessment of plans and programmes by the so-called \"Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive\" (2001/42/EC), which is now in force.\nUnder the EU directive, an EIA must provide certain information to comply. There are seven key areas that are required:\n\nAll projects are either classified as Annex 1 or Annex 2 projects. Those lying in Annex 1 are large scale developments such as motorways, chemical works, bridges, powerstations etc. These always require an EIA under the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive (85,337,EEC as amended). Annex 2 projects are smaller in scale than those referred to in Annex 1. Member States must determine whether these project shall be made subject to an assessment subject to a set of criteria set out in Annex 3 of codified Directive 2011/92/EU.\n\nEIA was implemented in Dutch legislation on September 1, 1987. The categories of projects that require an EIA are summarised in Dutch legislation, the Wet milieubeheer. The use of thresholds for activities makes sure that EIA is obligatory for those activities that may have considerable impacts on the environment.\n\nFor projects and plans that fit these criteria, an EIA report is required. The EIA report defines a.o. the proposed initiative, it makes clear the impact of that initiative on the environment and compares this with the impact of possible alternatives with less a negative impact.\n\nEIA in Hong Kong, since 1998, is regulated by the \"Environmental Impact Assessment Ordinance 1997\".\n\nThe original proposal to construct the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line overground across the Long Valley failed to get through EIA, and the Kowloon–Canton Railway Corporation had to change its plan and build the railway underground. In April 2011, the EIA of the Hong Kong section of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge was found to have breached the ordinance, and was declared unlawful. The appeal by the government was allowed in September 2011. However, it was estimated that this EIA court case had increased the construction cost of the Hong Kong section of the bridge by HK$6.5 billion in money-of-the-day prices.\n\nMinistry of Environment of the federal government of Iraq is in charge of issuing Environmental compliance certificate based on an EIA report prepared by professional consultant and thoroughly reviewed by MOE. Any project or activity prior to its establishment or even already existing project has to be approved and obtain such certificate from the MOE. Projects are classified into 3 categories; “A”, “B” and “C”. EIA report is usually obligatory for those projects and activities falling under categories “A” (large-scale) and “B” (small-scale) that may have considerable impacts on environment. An example of “A” category activities such as: dams and reservoirs, forestry production projects, industrial plants, irrigation, drainage and flood control, land clearance and leveling, port and harbor development, river basin development, thermal power and hydro-power development, manufacture, transportation and use of pesticides or other hazardous materials, hazardous waste management and disposal...etc. An example of “B” category activities such as: agro-industries, electrical transmission, renewable energy, rural electrification, tourism, rehabilitation or maintenance of highway or rural roads, rehabilitation or modification of existing industrial facilities...etc. preparation of EIA report is usually exempt for projects falling under category “C” that may have low to no impact on environment, and example of “C” category activities: small fish breeding pond, institutional development, most human resources projects...etc.\n\nThe main environmental legislations in Iraq are: Law No.64 for cities and land use (1965), Law No.21 for noise prevention (1966), Law No.25 for system of rivers and other water resources protection (1967), Law No.99 for ionized radiation (1980), Law No.89 for public health (drinking water provision, sanitation and environmental monitoring (1981), Law No.79 for protection and improvement of environment (1986), Environmental criteria for agricultural, industrial and public service projects (1990), Law No.3 for protection and improvement of environment (1997), Law No.2 for water systems protection (2001), Law No.44 for creation of Ministry of Environment instead of the council of protection and improvement of environment (2003), Law No.27 for environmental protection and improvement (2009), Law No.4 for protection of ambient air system (2012).\n\nMeanwhile, Environmental Protection and Improvement Board in the regional government of Kurdistan in the northern Iraq (Erbil, Duhok, Sulaimany and Garmyan) is responsible of issuing Environmental compliance certificate, the board was established according to law No.3 Environmental protection and improvement board in Iraqi Kurdistan Region (2010). The board is responsible of issuing such certificate for all projects and activities except of petroleum operation which EIA process is organized and implemented by the Ministry of Natural Resources of Kurdistan Regional government. The same Iraqi Environmental Legislations mentioned are adopted but the procedure of EIA in Iraqi-Kurdistan region government may differ from the one in the Federal government of Iraq.\n\nThe Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) of India has been in a great effort in Environmental Impact Assessment in India. The main laws in action are the Water Act(1974), the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act (1972), the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act (1981) and the Environment (Protection) Act (1986),Biological Diversity Act(2002). The responsible body for this is the Central Pollution Control Board.\nEnvironmental Impact Assessment (EIA) studies need a significant amount of primary and secondary environmental data. Primary data are those collected in the field to define the status of the environment (like air quality data, water quality data etc.). Secondary data are those collected over the years that can be used to understand the existing environmental scenario of the study area. The environmental impact assessment (EIA) studies are conducted over a short period of time and therefore the understanding of the environmental trends, based on a few months of primary data, has limitations. Ideally, the primary data must be considered along with the secondary data for complete understanding of the existing environmental status of the area. In many EIA studies, the secondary data needs could be as high as 80% of the total data requirement. EIC is the repository of one stop secondary data source for environmental impact assessment in India.\n\nThe Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) experience in India indicates that the lack of timely availability of reliable and authentic environmental data has been a major bottle neck in achieving the full benefits of EIA. The environment being a multi-disciplinary subject, a multitude of agencies are involved in collection of environmental data. However, no single organization in India tracks available data from these agencies and makes it available in one place in a form required by environmental impact assessment practitioners. Further, environmental data is not available in enhanced forms that improve the quality of the EIA. This makes it harder and more time-consuming to generate environmental impact assessments and receive timely environmental clearances from regulators. With this background, the Environmental Information Centre (EIC) has been set up to serve as a professionally managed clearing house of environmental information that can be used by MoEF, project proponents, consultants, NGOs and other stakeholders involved in the process of environmental impact assessment in India. EIC caters to the need of creating and disseminating of organized environmental data for various developmental initiatives all over the country.\n\nEIC stores data in GIS format and makes it available to all environmental impact assessment studies and to EIA stakeholders in a cost effective and timely manner. So that we can manage that in different proportions such as remedy measures etc.,\n\nRecycling culture and policy\nMinistry of Environment\n\nIn Malaysia, Section 34A, Environmental Quality Act, 1974 requires developments that have significant impact to the environment are required to conduct the Environmental impact assessment.\n\nIn Nepal, EIA has been integrated in major development projects since the early 1980s. In the planning history of Nepal, the sixth plan (1980–85), for the first time, recognized the need for EIA with the establishment of Environmental Impact Study Project (EISP) under the Department of Soil Conservation in 1982 to develop necessary instruments for integration of EIA in infrastructure\ndevelopment projects. However, the government of Nepal enunciated environment conservation related\npolicies in the seventh plan (NPC, 1985–1990). To enforce this policy and make necessary arrangements, a series of guidelines were developed, thereby incorporating the elements of environmental factors right from the project formulation stage of the development plans\nand projects and to avoid or minimize adverse effects on the ecological system. In addition, it has also emphasized that EIAs of industry, tourism, water resources, transportation, urbanization, agriculture, forest and other developmental projects be conducted.\n\nIn Nepal, the government's Environmental Impact Assessment Guideline of 1993 inspired the enactment of the Environment Protection Act (EPA) of 1997 and the Environment Protection Rules (EPR) of 1997 (EPA and EPR have been enforced since 24 and 26 June 1997 respectively in Nepal) to internalizing the environmental assessment system. The process institutionalized the EIA process in development proposals and enactment, which makes the integration of IEE and EIA legally binding to the prescribed projects. The projects, requiring EIA or IEE, are included in Schedules 1 and 2 of the EPR, 1997\n(GoN/MoLJPA 1997).\n\nIn New Zealand, EIA is usually referred to as \"Assessment of Environmental Effects\" (AEE). The first use of EIA's dates back to a Cabinet minute passed in 1974 called Environmental Protection and Enhancement Procedures. This had no legal force and only related to the activities of government departments. When the Resource Management Act was passed in 1991, an EIA was required as part of a resource consent application. Section 88 of the Act specifies that the AEE must include \"such detail as corresponds with the scale and significance of the effects that the activity may have on the environment\". While there is no duty to consult any person when making a resource consent application (Sections 36A and Schedule 4), proof of consultation is almost certain required by local councils when they decide whether or not to publicly notify the consent application under Section 93.\n\nAs of 2004, the state authority responsible for conducting the State EIA in Russia has been split between two Federal bodies: 1) Federal service for monitoring the use of natural resources – a part of the Russian Ministry for Natural Resources and Environment and 2) Federal Service for Ecological, Technological and Nuclear Control. The two main pieces of environmental legislation in Russia are: The Federal Law ‘On Ecological Expertise, 1995 and the ‘Regulations on Assessment of Impact from Intended Business and Other Activity on Environment in the Russian Federation, 2000.\n\nIn 2006, the parliament committee on ecology in conjunction with the Ministry for Natural Resources and Environment, created a working group to prepare a number of amendments to existing legislation to cover such topics as stringent project documentation for building of potentially environmentally damaging objects as well as building of projects on the territory of protected areas.\nThere has been some success in this area, as evidenced from abandonment of plans to construct a gas pipe-line through the only remaining habitat of the critically endangered Amur leopard in the Russian Far East.\n\nThe government's decision to hand over control over several important procedures, including state EIA in the field of all types of energy projects, to the Federal Service for Ecological, Technological and Nuclear Control had caused a major controversy and criticism from environmental groups that blamed the government for giving nuclear power industry control over the state EIA.\n\nNot surprisingly the main problem concerning State EIA in Russia is the clear differentiation of jurisdiction between the two above-mentioned Federal bodies.\n\nThe National Environmental Act, 1998 requires environmental impact assessment for large scale projects in sensitive areas. It is enforced by the Central Environmental Authority.\n\nThe new law of Ukraine on evaluation of impact on surroundings prescribes the requirements of environmental safety, rational use of national resources, minimizing of harmful impact on surroundings in the process of making managerial decisions about planned activity. The designing of the conclusion of evaluation of impact is a result of its conducting. The key moment of the law on evaluation of impact on surroundings is a substitution of conclusion of state environmental experise on the conclusion of evaluation of impact on surroundings. Business entity is forbidden to conduct or to start its planned activity without the conclusion of impact on surroundings.\n\nThe National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), enacted in 1970, established a policy of environmental impact assessment for federal agency actions, federally funded activities or federally permitted/licensed activities that in the U. S. is termed \"environmental review\" or simply \"the NEPA process.\" The law also created the Council on Environmental Quality, which promulgated regulations to codify the law's requirements. Under United States environmental law an Environmental Assessment (EA) is compiled to determine the need for an \"Environmental Impact Statement\" (EIS). Federal or federalized actions expected to subject or be subject to significant environmental impacts will publish a Notice of Intent to Prepare an EIS as soon as significance is known. Certain actions of federal agencies must be preceded by the NEPA process. Contrary to a widespread misconception, NEPA does not prohibit the federal government or its licensees/permittees from harming the environment, nor does it specify any penalty if an environmental impact assessment turns out to be inaccurate, intentionally or otherwise. NEPA requires that plausible statements as to the prospective impacts be disclosed in advance. The purpose of NEPA process is to ensure that the decision maker is fully informed of the environmental aspects and consequences prior to making the final decision.\n\nAn environmental assessment (EA) is an environmental analysis prepared pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act to determine whether a federal action would significantly affect the environment and thus require a more detailed \"Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)\". The certified release of an Environmental Assessment results in either a \"Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI)\" or an EIS.\n\nThe Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), which oversees the administration of NEPA, issued regulations for implementing the NEPA in 1979. Eccleston reports that the NEPA regulations barely mention preparation of EAs. This is because the EA was originally intended to be a simple document used in relatively rare instances where an agency was not sure if the potential significance of an action would be sufficient to trigger preparation of an EIS. But today, because EISs are so much longer and complicated to prepare, federal agencies are going to great effort to avoid preparing EISs by using EAs, even in cases where the use of EAs may be inappropriate. The ratio of EAs that are being issued compared to EISs is about 100 to 1.\n\nLikewise, even the preparation of an accurate EA is viewed today as an onerous burden by many entities responsible for the environmental review of a proposal. Federal agencies have responded by streamlining their regulations that implement NEPA environmental review, by defining categories of projects that by their well understood nature may be safely excluded from review under NEPA, and by drawing up lists of project types that have negligible material impact upon the environment and can thus be exempted.\n\nThe Environmental Assessment is a concise public document prepared by the federal action agency that serves to:\n\nThe Environmental Assessment includes a brief discussion of the purpose and need of the proposal and of its alternatives as required by NEPA 102(2)(E), and of the human environmental impacts resulting from and occurring to the proposed actions and alternatives considered practicable, plus a listing of studies conducted and agencies and stakeholders consulted to reach these conclusions. The action agency must approve an EA before it is made available to the public. The EA is made public through notices of availability by local, state, or regional clearing houses, often triggered by the purchase of a public notice advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in the proposed activity area.\n\nThe structure of a generic Environmental Assessment is as follows:\n\nThe EA becomes a draft public document when notice of it is published, usually in a newspaper of general circulation in the area affected by the proposal. There is a 15-day review period required for an Environmental Assessment (30 days if exceptional circumstances) while the document is made available for public commentary, and a similar time for any objection to improper process. Commenting on the Draft EA is typically done in writing or email, submitted to the lead action agency as published in the notice of availability. An EA does not require a public hearing for verbal comments. Following the mandated public comment period, the lead action agency responds to any comments, and certifies either a FONSI or a Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an EIS in its public environmental review record. The preparation of an EIS then generates a similar but more lengthy, involved and expensive process.\n\nThe adequacy of an environmental impact statement (EIS) can be challenged in federal court. Major proposed projects have been blocked because of an agency's failure to prepare an acceptable EIS. One prominent example was the Westway landfill and highway development in and along the Hudson River in New York City. Another prominent case involved the Sierra Club suing the Nevada Department of Transportation over its denial of the club's request to issue a supplemental EIS addressing air emissions of particulate matter and hazardous air pollutants in the case of widening U.S. Route 95 through Las Vegas. The case reached the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which led to construction on the highway being halted until the court's final decision. The case was settled prior to the court's final decision.\n\nSeveral state governments that have adopted \"little NEPAs,\" state laws imposing EIS requirements for particular state actions. Some of those state laws such as the California Environmental Quality Act refer to the required environmental impact study as an environmental impact report.\n\nThis variety of state requirements produces voluminous data not just upon impacts of individual projects, but also in insufficiently researched scientific domains. For example, in a seemingly routine \"Environmental Impact Report\" for the city of Monterey, California, information came to light that led to the official federal endangered species listing of Hickman's potentilla, a rare coastal wildflower.\n\nEnvironmental threats do not respect national borders. International pollution can have detrimental effects on the atmosphere, oceans, rivers, aquifers, farmland, the weather and biodiversity. Global climate change is transnational. Specific pollution threats include acid rain, radioactive contamination, debris in outer space, stratospheric ozone depletion and toxic oil spills. The Chernobyl disaster, precipitated by a nuclear accident on April 26, 1986, is a stark reminder of the devastating effects of transboundary nuclear pollution.\n\nEnvironmental protection is inherently a cross-border issue and has led to the creation of transnational regulation via multilateral and bilateral treaties. The United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (UNCHE or Stockholm Conference) held in Stockholm in 1972 and the United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development (UNCED or Rio Summit, Rio Conference, or Earth Summit) held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 were key in the creation of about 1,000 international instruments that include at least some provisions related to the environment and its protection.\n\nThe United Nations Economic Commission for Europe's Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context was negotiated to provide an international legal framework for transboundary EIA.\n\nHowever, as there is no universal legislature or administration with a comprehensive mandate, most international treaties exist parallel to one another and are further developed without the benefit of consideration being given to potential conflicts with other agreements. There is also the issue of international enforcement.\nThis has led to duplications and failures, in part due to an inability to enforce agreements. An example is the failure of many international \nfisheries regimes to restrict harvesting practises.\nApplication shall be achieved by the willing of counties authorities. / Aphro10\n\nAs per Jay \"et al.\", EIA is used as a decision aiding tool rather than decision making tool. There is growing dissent about them as their influence on decisions is limited. Improved training for practitioners, guidance on bestpractice and continuing research have all been proposed.\n\nEIAs have been criticized for excessively limiting their scope in space and time. No accepted procedure exists for determining such boundaries. The boundary refers to ‘the spatial and temporal boundary of the proposal’s effects’. This boundary is determined by the applicant and the lead assessor, but in practice, almost all EIAs address only direct and immediate on-site effects.\n\nDevelopment causes both direct and indirect effects. Consumption of goods and services, production, use and disposal of building materials and machinery, additional land use for activities of manufacturing and services, mining and refining, etc., all have environmental impacts. The indirect effects of development can be much higher than the direct effects examined by an EIA. Proposals such as airports or shipyards cause wide-ranging national and international effects, which should be covered in EIAs.\n\nBroadening the scope of EIA can benefit the conservation of threatened species. Instead of concentrating on the project site, some EIAs employed a habitat-based approach that focused on much broader relationships among humans and the environment. As a result, alternatives that reduce the negative effects to the population of whole species, rather than local subpopulations, can be assessed.\n\nThissen and Agusdinata have argued that little attention is given to the systematic identification and assessment of uncertainties in environmental studies which is critical in situations where uncertainty cannot be easily reduced by doing more research. In line with this, Maier et al. have concluded on the need to consider uncertainty at all stages of the decision-making process. In such a way decisions can be made with confidence or known uncertainty. These proposals are justified on data that shows that environmental assessments fail to predict accurately the impacts observed. Tenney et al. and Wood et al. have reported evidence of the intrinsic uncertainty attached to EIAs predictions from a number of case studies worldwide. The gathered evidence consisted of comparisons between predictions in EIAs and the impacts measured during, or following project implementation. In explaining this trend, Tenney et al. have highlighted major causes such as project changes, modelling errors, errors in data and assumptions taken and bias introduced by people in the projects analyzed.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13374290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13374290", "title": "European Civil Service", "text": "European Civil Service\n\nThe European Civil Service is a generic term applied to all staff serving the institutions and agencies of the European Union (EU). Although recruitment is sometimes done jointly, each institution is responsible for its own internal structures and hierarchies.\n\nThe rules, principles, standards and working conditions of the European civil service are set out in the \"Staff Regulations\".\n\nThe European Ombudsman has summarised the following five principles of public service which apply to all staff of the EU institutions:\n\nThe European Commission's civil service is headed by a Secretary General, currently Martin Selmayr who succeeded Alexander Italianer in March 2018. According to figures published by the Commission, 24,428 persons were employed by the Commission as officials and temporary agents in their 2016 budget. In addition to these, 9066 \"external staff\" were employed; these are largely people employed on time-limited contracts (called \"contractual agents\" in the jargon), staff seconded from national administrations (called \"Detached National Experts\"), or trainees (called \"stagiaires\"). The single largest DG is the Directorate-General for Translation, with 2261 staff.\n\nEuropean civil servants are sometimes referred to in the anglophone press as \"Eurocrats\" (a term coined by Richard Mayne, a journalist and personal assistant to the first Commission president, Walter Hallstein). High-ranking officials are sometimes referred to as \"European Mandarins\".. \n\nThese terms are sometimes erroneously used by the anglophone press, usually as a derogatory slur, to describe Members of the European Parliament, or European Commissioners. MEPs are directly elected representatives, whilst the European Commissioners, despite often being confused as civil servants, are politicians holding public office and accountable to the European Parliament. Much like government ministers at the national level, they instruct the policy direction of the civil service.\n\nThere are staff from all member states, with the largest group being Belgian (17.8% – 4,193), with French and Italian servants following with about 2,500 (10%).\n\nMost administration is based in the Belgian capital, Often, those states under-represented in the service tend to have more of their nationals in the higher ranks.\n\nThe qualifications needed to enter the European civil service depend on whether the job is a specialist one and the grade. One of the entry qualifications for the European civil service is that the candidate speak at least two of the official European languages, one of which must be English, French or German. Candidates whose mother tongue is English, French or German must pass the competition for entry in one of the other two official languages.\n\nPrior to their first promotion, officials must demonstrate competence in a third EU official language.\n\nA candidate also needs to have a first degree in any discipline. The services have traditionally hired candidates with degrees in Law, Economics, or Audit; competition is tougher for graduates of all other disciplines, although the procedure for the open competitions, known as \"Concours\", is now under review.\n\nStaff are divided into a set of grades: from AD 5, the most junior administrator grade, to AD 16, which is a director-general (AD = administrator). Alongside the AD category is AST (assistant). It is now possible for civil servants to be promoted from AST to AD grade, not previously possible (see below); however in practice the grades remain entrenched. While promotion is in theory according to merit, many management posts are now taken by officials 'parachuted in' from member states. Moreover, staff reforms introduced in 2004 have severely reduced the possibilities for career progression and have created divisions within the service, with pre-2004 entrants enjoying greater pay and privileges. According to the Commission's own internal statistics, even though new officials possess an average of eight years work experience, it would take an average of over 40 years to climb from AD 5 to AD 16.\n\nPrior to this new system, introduced in the 2000s (decade), civil servants were traditionally divided into four categories. \"A\" was policy making (what is now AD), \"B' was implementing, \"C\" was secretarial and \"D\" was drivers and messengers (B, C and D are now all part of the AST category). There were various grades in each category. The major ranks used to be in the form of A8 (new appointment without prior work experience) to A1 (director-general).\n\n They receive a minimum of 24 days of leave a year (maximum of 30), .\n\nThe lowest grades receive between €1.618,83 gross (FG 1 step 1) each month, while the highest grades (AD 15–16 – i.e. Directors General at the end of their career) receives between €14,822.86 and €16,094.79 a month. This salary is taxed by the EU, rather than at the national level. Taxation varies between 8% and 45% depending on individual circumstances. This is paid into the Community budget.\n\nEarnings are augmented by allowances, such as allowances for those living outside their own country, those who are the principal earner in their household, those with children in full-time education, and those who are moving home in order to take up a position or leaving the service.\nEarnings are also lowered by various additional taxes (i.e. \"Special Levy\" alias 'crisis levy' introduced in 1973 and increasing regularly every year) and indexes (for EU staff working out-side Brussels).\n\nFor a contribution of 2% basic salary, employees are provided with health insurance which covers a maximum of 85% of expenses (100% for serious injury). Employees have the right to a parental leave of six months per person and child during which they obtain an allowance and have (as of January 2014) the possibility of an extension by further 6 months with a smaller allowance.\n\nIn January 2010, The European Commission took the EU member states to court over the Member States' refusal to honour a long-standing formula under which wages for the staff of the European institutions are indexed to the salaries of national civil servants. The formula led to a salary adjustment of 3.7% but the Council, representing the member states, was only willing to grant a pay rise of 1.85%. In November 2010, the European Court of Justice ruled that there was no legal basis for the Council to set the pay rise to 1.85%. It has been noted that the ECJ judges who would decide in this case would be themselves to benefit from any salary increase agreed. To be noted that the index is published and applied one year and half later, and this delay cause the quarrels like in the 2010 (full crisis) where should be applied the adaptation related to the increases of wages of the national civil servants from 2007–8; while in 2011 the index was already negative (as the national wages has been lowered).\n\nEmployees contribute about 11.3% of their basic salary to a pension scheme. This scheme does not constitute a separate, ring-fenced pension fund; rather, pension payments are made from the general administrative budget of the Commission.\n\nPensions are paid as a percentage of the final basic salary, with a ceiling of 70%, at an accrual rate of 1.8% per year of service (with a higher accrual rate of 1.9% per year of service for those who entered service between 1 May 2004 and 31 December 2013, and 2% per year of service for those who entered service before 1 May 2004). The pensionable age is 66 years for staff entering service as of 1 January 2014, is between 63 and 65 years for those who entered service before 1 January 2014 but not earlier than 1 May 2004, and is between 60 and 65 years for those who entered service before 1 May 2004. Early retirement is possible as of 58 years but a pension reduction coefficient of 3.5% is applied for each year before the pensionable age, except that for staff in place on 1 January 2014 the pension reduction coefficient is 1.75 for years not worked above the age of 60.\n\nBefore 1 January 2014, the pensionable age had been 63 years for those who entered service on 1 May 2004 or later, and between 60 and 63 years for those who entered service before 1 May 2004. Early retirement was possible as of 55 years, albeit with a reduction of the pension due to the pension reduction coefficient of 3.5% per year before the pensionable age, except that a small percentage of officials could retire early without that pension reduction if it was in the interest of the service. To mitigate the changes implemented as of 2014, transitional pension rules were put in place for staff in place on 1 January 2014, which included setting the pensionable age for staff between 55 and 60 years of age on 1 January 2014 to lie between 60 and 61 years. Transition measures applied also to early retirement: Staff already aged 54 years or older on 1 January 2014 could still retire, with application of the pension reduction coefficient, in 2014 or 2015 at the age of 56 years or in 2016 at the age of 57 years.\n\nBefore 1 May 2004, the pensionable age had been 60 years, and when this age was raised in 2004, this was accompanied by transition measures so that it remained unchangedly at 60 for officials aged 50 or more as well as for officials who had already completed 20 years of service or more on 1 May 2004, and it varied from 60 years and 2 months to 62 years and 8 months for officials aged 30 to 49 on 1 May 2004.\n\nRecruitment is on the basis of competitions organised centrally by EPSO (European Personnel Selection Office) on the basis of qualifications and of the need for staff.\n\nDuring the 1980s, the Commission was primarily dominated by French, German and Italian cultural influences, including a strictly hierarchical organisation. Commissioners and Directors-General were referred to by their title (in French) with greater prestige for those of higher ranks. As one former servant, Derk Jan Eppink has put it, even after new staff had passed the tough entrance exams: \"Those at the top counted for everything. Those at the bottom counted for nothing.\" One example of this was the chef de cabinet of President Jacques Delors, Pascal Lamy, who was particularly notable for his immense influence over other civil servants. He became known as the \"Beast of the Berlaymont\", the \"Gendarme\" and the \"Exocet\" due to his habit of ordering civil servants, even Directors-General (head of departments) \"precisely what to do – or else.\" He was seen as ruling Delors's office with a \"rod of iron\", with no-one able to bypass or manipulate him and those who tried being \"banished to one of the less pleasant European postings\".\n\nHowever, since the enlargement of the EU, and therefore the arrival of staff from the many newer Member States, there has been a change in the culture of the civil service. New civil servants from northern and eastern states brought in new influences while the Commission's focus has shifted more to \"participation\" and \"consultation\". A more egalitarian culture took over, with Commissioners no longer having a \"status equivalent to a sun God\" and, with this new populism, the first women were appointed to the Commission in the 1990s and the service gained its first female secretary general in 2006 (Catherine Day). In stark contrast to the 1980s, it is not uncommon to see men without ties and children playing football in the corridors.\n\nIt has been alleged that, for want of a common administrative culture, European Civil Servants are held together by a \"common mission\" which gives DGs a particularly enthusiastic attitude to the production of draft legislation regardless of the intentions of the Commissioner. They are also notably bound by their common procedures, in the absence of a common administrative culture, which are best known by the Secretariat-General, thus considered a prestigious office, just below the President's cabinet.\n\nThere has been some criticism that the highly fragmented DG structure wastes a considerable amount of time in turf wars as the different departments and Commissioners compete with each other, as is the case in national administrations. Furthermore, the DGs can exercise considerable control over a Commissioner unless the Commissioner learns to assert control over his/her staff. The DGs work closely with the Commissioner's cabinet. While the DG has responsibility for preparation of work and documents, the cabinet has responsibility for giving the Commissioner political guidance. However, in practice both seek a share of each other's work. It has been alleged that some DGs try to influence decision making by providing Commissioners with briefing documents as late and large as possible, ensuring that the Commissioner has no time to do anything but accept the version of facts presented by the DG. In doing this the DG is competing with the cabinet, which acts as a \"bodyguard\" for the Commissioner.\n\nThe Commission is divided into departments known as Directorates-General (DGs or \"the services\"), each headed by a director-general, and various other services. Each covers a specific policy area or service such as External Relations or Translation and is under the responsibility of a European Commissioner. DGs prepare proposals for their Commissioners which can then be put forward for voting in the college of Commissioners.\n\nWhilst the Commission's DGs cover similar policy areas to the ministries in national governments, European Civil Servants have not necessarily been trained, or worked, in a national civil service before employment in the EU. On entry, they do not therefore share a common administrative culture.\n\nThe Directorates-General are divided into four groups: Policy DGs, External relations DGs, General Service DGs and Internal Service DGs. Internally, the DGs are referred to by their abbreviations; provided below.\n\n\n\nCenter for Adaptation of Civil Service to the Standards of EU – public institution established by the Decree of Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine to facilitate administrative reform in Ukraine and to enhance the adaptation of the civil service to the standards of the European Union.\n"}

The shooting renewed debate about gun control. The debates focused on requiring background checks on all firearm sales (called universal background checks), and on passing new and expanded assault weapon and high-capacity magazine bans.\n\nOn December 14, 2012, twenty children and seven adults were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. It was the deadliest primary or secondary school shooting, the third-deadliest mass shooting by a single person, and one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history.\n\nWithin hours of the shooting, a We the People user started a petition asking the White House to \"immediately address the issue of gun control through the introduction of legislation in Congress,\" and the gun control advocacy group the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence reported that an avalanche of donations caused its website to crash. That afternoon, President Barack Obama made a televised statement offering condolences on behalf of the nation to Connecticut governor, Dannel Malloy and saying, \"we're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics.\" Speaking at a December 16 memorial service in Newtown, Obama said he would \"use whatever power this office holds\" to prevent similar tragedies. By December 17, the White House petition had more than 150,000 signatures, and one week after the shooting it had almost 200,000, along with those on 30 similar petitions.\n\nA \"USA Today\"/Gallup poll conducted days after the shooting showed \"mixed results\" regarding public opinion on firearm laws. While public support for strengthening gun laws rose 15 percent compared to a similar poll in 2011, there had been \"little change in attitudes about some longstanding proposals, including the outlawing of assault rifles.\" A law requiring background checks for all gun-show sales was favored by 92 percent of Americans and a law banning the sale and possession of high-capacity magazines (defined by the poll as those capable of holding more than 10 rounds) was supported by 62 percent of Americans. A record-high 74 percent opposed a ban on handguns and 51 percent opposed banning assault weapons.\n\nOn December 19, 2012, President Obama announced the formation of an inter-agency gun-violence task force headed by Vice President Joe Biden. The task force held 22 meetings and collected ideas from 229 organizations.\n\nThe NRA and congressional Republicans said that violent video games were a large part of the problem, but those did not end up on the final list of recommendations. After meeting with Biden, the NRA issued a statement saying that it was \"disappointed with how little this meeting had to do with keeping our children safe and how much it had to do with an agenda to attack the Second Amendment.\"\nOn January 16, 2013, President Obama announced a plan for reducing gun violence in four parts: closing background check loopholes; banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines; making schools safer; and increasing access to mental health services. The plan included 23 executive actions, signed immediately by the president, and 12 proposals for Congress.\n\nThe executive actions signed by President Obama were:\n\nThe White House's proposed congressional actions were these:\n\nThe proposals were opposed by the NRA and the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), and opposition was expected by Republican and some Democratic legislators.\n\nOn December 21, 2012 - between the formation of Biden's task force and the announcement of Obama's proposals - Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the National Rifle Association (NRA), expressed the gun-rights group's sympathy for the families of Newtown. LaPierre said that gun-free school zones attract killers, and that \"the media demonize lawful gun owners, amplify their cries for more laws, and fill the national media with misinformation and dishonest thinking that only delay meaningful action.\" He said, \"The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,\" and that debating legislation that won't work would be a waste of time. He called on Congress \"to act immediately to appropriate whatever is necessary to put armed police officers in every single school in this nation\" so that every school in America would be safe when pupils returned to school in January 2013. LaPierre announced that the NRA would develop a National Model School Shield Program for every American school that wants it.\n\nAfter LaPierre's press conference, the Brady Campaign asked for donations to support its gun control advocacy and asked NRA members \"who believe like we do, that we are better than this\" to join its campaign. On January 8, 2013, former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot and injured in a 2011 shooting in Tucson, launched Americans for Responsible Solutions to raise money for gun control efforts to counter the influence of powerful pro-gun groups such as the NRA.\n\nOn January 24, 2013, Senator Dianne Feinstein and 24 Democratic cosponsors introduced , the Assault Weapons Ban of 2013 (AWB 2013). It was similar to the expired 1994 federal ban, but differed in that it used a one-feature test for a firearm to be considered an assault weapon, rather than the two-feature test of the 1994 ban. Gun-control advocates said the stricter test would make the weapons less appealing to gun enthusiasts. In addition, it would have banned: \nIt would have grandfathered in weapons legally owned on the day of enactment and exempted 2,258 specific firearms \"used for hunting or sporting purposes,\" of which only 33 were semiautomatic centerfire rifles.\n\nFeinstein wanted the grandfathered firearms registered under the National Firearms Act, which currently registers machineguns, silencers and short barreled shotguns.\n\nOn March 14, 2013, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved the bill, though it was not expected to clear the full Senate or the House. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid decided to leave the proposed ban out of the broader gun control bill, saying that it was unlikely to win 40 votes in the 100-member chamber and that it would jeopardize more widely supported proposals. On the morning of April 17, 2013, the bill failed on a vote of 40 to 60. It was supported by Democrat Reid and Republican Senator Mark Kirk, but 15 Democrats, one independent, and all the Republicans except Kirk voted against the ban.\n\nThe Manchin-Toomey Amendment was a bi-partisan piece of legislation sponsored by Joe Manchin, a Democrat, and Republican Sen. Pat Toomey that would require background checks on most private party firearm sales. The bill known as Manchin Amendment No. 715 was voted on and defeated on April 17, 2013 by a vote of 54 - 46. It needed 60 votes to pass.\n\n, only five states had passed stricter gun control laws, while ten states had passed laws that weakened restrictions on firearms.\n\nIn the early morning hours of April 4, 2013, the Connecticut General Assembly passed new restrictions to the state's existing assault weapons ban. Governor Dannel Malloy signed them into law later the same day. The law banned the sale or purchase of magazines capable of holding more than ten rounds of ammunition like those used in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, and required universal background checks for all firearm purchases.\n\nGun owners challenged the law, but federal judge Alfred Covello upheld the law, ruling it constitutional and writing, \"While the act burdens the plaintiffs' Second Amendment rights, it is substantially related to the important governmental interest of public safety and crime control.\" Gun owners said they would appeal.\n\nIn February 2014, the \"Hartford Courant\" reported that Connecticut had processed about 50,000 assault weapons certificates, but that anywhere from 50,000 to 350,000 remained unregistered. \"And that means,\" wrote the \"Courant's\" Dan Haar, \"as of Jan. 1, Connecticut has very likely created tens of thousands of newly minted criminals — perhaps 100,000 people, almost certainly at least 20,000 — who have broken no other laws.\" Frank Miniter wrote in an April 2014 \"Forbes\" op-ed \"that more than 300,000 Connecticut residents decided not to register their 'assault weapons,' moved them out of state, or sold them.\"\n\nIn January 2013, New York became the first U.S. state to act after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement (SAFE) Act passed in the state Senate 43-18 on January 15 and cleared the New York State Assembly after about five hours of debate on Tuesday, January 16. It was signed by Governor Andrew Cuomo one hour later. The act expanded the definition of assault weapons banned in New York, created a state database for pistol permits, reduced the maximum number of rounds legally allowed in magazines to seven from ten, and required universal background checks on all gun sales.\n\nA dozen Republican conference members voted for the measure, but its Senate Republican leader did not attend the signing ceremony. The NRA called the assembly's actions \"a secretive end run around the legislative and democratic process ... with no committee hearings and no public input,\" and said the law was \"draconian.\"\n\nIn a related move, the state comptroller announced that the state's pension fund would freeze its investments in publicly traded firearm manufacturers. The fund's holdings in Smith & Wesson had been sold in December, after the Connecticut shootings.\n\nProvisions of the SAFE Act have been challenged. On December 31, 2013, a federal court judge struck down the act's limit of seven rounds in magazines capable of holding 10, but upheld its expanded ban on assault weapons. As of April 2014 that decision was under appeal, and another challenge, that the bill was improperly fast-tracked, was dismissed by a trial-level judge. The plaintiff said that he will take that decision to the New York Court of Appeals.\n\nNon-compliance with this new law has been reported in New York. Frank Miniter wrote in an April 2014 \"Forbes\" op-ed that one million residents own \"assault weapons\" and \"high-capacity magazines\" (which he says are political terms). He wrote that many had decided to practice civil disobedience and not register their weapons, a class A misdemeanor with a potential sentence of one year in prison. \"USA Today\" reported that some owners threatened not to register their weapons, and that some chose to bypass registration by modifying or selling them before the April 15 deadline. State police say they cannot report how many people have registered. By law, they must keep their database of assault weapon owners private.\n\nLate on April 4, 2013, the Maryland General Assembly passed Governor Martin O'Malley's gun control bill, the Firearm Safety Act of 2013. It bans the purchase of 45 types of assault weapons and limits gun magazines to 10 rounds. It requires handgun licensing and fingerprinting for new gun owners, and bans those who have been involuntarily committed to a mental health facility from buying a gun.\n\n"}

{"id": "568942", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=568942", "title": "International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea", "text": "International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea\n\nThe International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea 1972 (COLREGs) are published by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and set out, among other things, the \"rules of the road\" or navigation rules to be followed by ships and other vessels at sea to prevent collisions between two or more vessels. COLREGs can also refer to the specific political line that divides inland waterways, which are subject to their own navigation rules, and coastal waterways which are subject to international navigation rules. The COLREGs are derived from a multilateral treaty called the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea.\n\nAlthough rules for navigating vessels inland may differ, the international rules specify that they should be as closely in line with the international rules as possible. In most of continental Europe, the Code Européen des Voies de la Navigation Intérieure (CEVNI, or the European Code for Navigation on Inland Waters) apply. In the United States, the rules for vessels navigating inland are published alongside the international rules.\n\nThe Racing Rules of Sailing, which govern the conduct of yacht and dinghy racing under the sanction of national sailing authorities which are members of the International Sailing Federation (ISAF), are based on the COLREGs, but differ in some important matters such as overtaking and right of way close to turning marks in competitive sailing.\n\nPrior to the development of a single set of international rules and practices, there existed separate practices and various conventions and informal procedures in different parts of the world, as advanced by various maritime nations. As a result, there were inconsistencies and even contradictions that gave rise to unintended collisions. Vessel navigation lights for operating in darkness as well as navigation marks also were not standardised, giving rise to dangerous confusion and ambiguity between vessels at risk of colliding.\n\nWith the advent of steam-powered ships in the mid-19th century, conventions for sailing vessel navigation had to be supplemented with conventions for power-driven vessel navigation. Sailing vessels are limited as to their manoeuvrability in that they cannot sail directly into the wind and cannot be readily navigated in the absence of wind. On the other hand, steamships can manoeuvre in all 360 degrees of direction and can be manoeuvred irrespective of the presence or absence of wind.\n\nIn 1840 in London, the Trinity House drew up a set of regulations which were enacted by Parliament in 1846. The Trinity House rules were included in the Steam Navigation Act 1846, and the Admiralty regulations regarding lights for steam ships were included in this statute in 1848. In 1849 Congress extended the light requirements to sailing vessels on US waters. In the UK in 1858 coloured sidelights were recommended for sailing vessels and fog signals were required to be given, by steam vessels on the ships whistle and by sailing vessels on the fog horn or bell, while a separate but similar action was also taken in the United States.\n\nIn 1850, English maritime Law was being adopted in the United States.\n\nAlso in 1850, courts in the England and the United States adopted common law pertaining to reasonable speed within the Assured Clear Distance Ahead.\n\nIn 1863 a new set of rules drawn up by the British Board of Trade, in consultation with the French government, came into force. By 1864 the regulations (or Articles) had been adopted by more than thirty maritime countries, including Germany and the United States (passed by the United States Congress as \"Rules to prevent Collisions at Sea.\" An act fixing certain rules and regulations for preventing collisions on the water. 29 April 1864, ch. 69. and signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln).\n\nIn 1867, Thomas Gray, assistant secretary to the Maritime Department of the Board of Trade, wrote \"The Rule of the Road\", a pamphlet that became famous for its well-known mnemonic verses.\n\nIn 1878, the United States codified its common law rules for preventing collisions.\n\nIn 1880, the 1863 Articles were supplemented with whistle signals and in 1884 a new set of international regulations was implemented.\n\nIn 1889 the United States convened the first international maritime conference in Washington, D.C. The resulting rules were adopted in 1890 and effected in 1897. Some minor changes were made during the 1910 Brussels Maritime Conference and some rule changes were proposed, but never ratified, at the 1929 International Conference on Safety of Life at Sea (S.O.L.A.S.) With the recommendation that the direction of a turn be referenced by the rudder instead of the helm or tiller being informally agreed by all maritime nations in 1935.\n\nThe 1948 S.O.L.A.S. International Conference made several recommendations, including the recognition of radar these were eventually ratified in 1952 and became effective in 1954. Further recommendations were made by a S.O.L.A.S. Conference in London in 1960 which became effective in 1965\n\nThe \"International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea\" were adopted as a convention of the International Maritime Organization on 20 October 1972 and entered into force on 15 July 1977. They were designed to update and replace the Collision Regulations of 1960, particularly with regard to Traffic Separation Schemes (TSS) following the first of these, introduced in the Strait of Dover in 1967. As of June 2013, the convention has been ratified by 155 states representing 98.7% of the tonnage of the world's merchant fleets.\n\nThey have been amended several times since their first adoption. In 1981 Rule 10 was amended with regard to dredging or surveying in traffic separation schemes. In 1987 amendments were made to several rules, including rule 1(e) for vessels of special construction; rule 3(h), vessels constrained by her draught and Rule 10(c), crossing traffic lanes. In 1989 Rule 10 was altered to stop unnecessary use of the inshore traffic zones associated with TSS. In 1993 amendments were made concerning the positioning of lights on vessels. In 2001 new rules were added relating to wing-in-ground-effect (WIG) craft and in 2007 the text of Annex IV (Distress signals) was rewritten.\n\nThe International Maritime Organization (IMO) convention, including the almost four dozen \"rules\" contained in the international regulations, must be adopted by each member country that is signatory to the convention—COLREG laws must exist within each jurisdiction. Thereafter, each IMO member country must designate an \"administration\"—national authority or agency—for implementing the provisions of the COLREG convention, as it applies to vessels over which the national authority has jurisdiction. Individual governing bodies must pass legislation to establish or assign such authority, as well as to create national navigation laws (and subsequent specific regulations) which conform to the international convention; each national administration is thereafter responsible for the implementation and enforcement of the regulations as it applies to ships and vessels under its legal authority. As well, each administrations are typically empowered to enact modifications that apply to vessels in waters under the national jurisdiction concerned, provided that any such modifications are not inconsistent with the COLREGs.\n\nTypically, the COLREG rules are incorporated within each nation's regulatory instruments \"by reference\". The rules are then specified in great detail in the regulations.\n\nThe full texts of current rules, as they apply in various national jurisdictions, are available in book form, and likewise from various national administration websites. The multiple books are thus in many languages, and not only provide the rules, but also provide discussion and examples related to interpreting the raw rules, including diagrams and hypothetical cases.\n\nCertain individuals are legally required to carry or possess a copy of the rules, such as the owners and/or operators of certain vessels, and individuals subject to the rules are expected be aware of them. Copies of the complete sets of regulations, each with their official wordings, are available from government and other maritime sources.\n\nThe UK version of the COLREGs is provided by the MCA, in the \"Merchant Shipping (Distress Signals and Prevention of Collisions) Regulations of 1996.\" They are distributed and accessed in the form of a \"Merchant Shipping Notice\" (MSN), which is used to convey mandatory information that must be complied with under UK legislation. These MSNs relate to Statutory Instruments and contain the technical detail of such regulations. Material published by the MCA is subject to Crown copyright protection, but the MCA allows it to be reproduced free of charge in any format or medium for research or private study, provided it is reproduced accurately and not used in a misleading context.\n\nThe US version of the COLREGs is provided by the US Coast Guard of the US Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThe Canadian version of the COLREGs is provided by Transport Canada, which regulates Canadian vessels.\n\nA commonly held misconception concerning the rules of marine navigation is that by following specific rules, a vessel can gain certain rights of way over other vessels. No vessel ever has absolute \"right of way\" over other vessels. Rather, there can be a \"give way\" (burdened) vessel and a \"stand on\" (privileged) vessel, or there may be two give way vessels with no stand on vessel. A stand on vessel does not have an absolute right of way over any give way vessel, for if there is a risk of collision, a stand on vessel may still be obliged (under Rule 2 and Rule 17) to give way so as to avoid it, if doing so will be effective and is practicable. Two power-driven vessels approaching each other head-to-head, are \"both\" deemed to be \"give way\" and both are required to alter course so as to avoid colliding with the other. Neither vessel has \"right of way\".\n\nThe summary below is based upon but is not identical to the published text.\n[Rule 2 is sometimes referred to as the \"General Prudential\" rule and provides for non-conformance with stated rules to prevent a collision, because what is paramount is to avoid or minimise the damaging effects of a collision, as opposed to blindly following the rules to the letter. The overall intent is to minimise actual collision taking place rather than rule compliance in and of itself, per se.]\nFor the purpose of these Rules, except where the context otherwise requires:\n\nIn determining a safe speed the following factors shall be among those taken into account:\n\n(a) By all vessels:\n(b) Additionally, by vessels with operational radar:\n\n\n\n\n\nSailing vessels underway and vessels under oars\nFishing Vessels\nVessels not under command or restricted in their ability to manoeuvre\n\n\nAny vessel (or class of vessel) provided that she complies with the requirements of the International Regulations for the Preventing of Collisions at Sea, 1960, the keel of which is laid or is at a corresponding stage of construction before the entry into force of these Regulations may be exempted from compliance therewith as follows:\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Refer to the Framework and Procedures for the IMO Member State Audit Scheme (resolution A.1067(28)).\n\nRule 40 Application\n\nContracting Parties shall use the provisions of the Code for Implementation in the execution of their obligations and responsibilities contained in the present Convention.\n\nRule 41 Verification of compliance\n\n(a) Every Contracting Party shall be subject to periodic audits by the Organization in accordance with the audit standard to verify compliance with and implementation of the present Convention.\n\n(b) The Secretary-General of the Organization shall have responsibility for administering the Audit Scheme, based on the guidelines developed by the Organization.*\n\n(c) Every Contracting Party shall have responsibility for facilitating the conduct of the audit and implementation of a programme of actions to address the findings, based on the guidelines developed by the Organization.*\n\n(d) Audit of all Contracting Parties shall be:\n\n(i) based on an overall schedule developed by the Secretary-General of the Organization, taking into account the guidelines developed by the Organization;* and\n\n(ii) conducted at periodic intervals, taking into account the guidelines developed by the Organization.*\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Refer to the Framework and Procedures for the IMO Member State Audit Scheme (resolution A.1067(28)).\"\n\n\n1.

It was founded in 2008 and by November 2014, KAT became the most visited BitTorrent directory in the world, overtaking The Pirate Bay, according to the site's Alexa ranking. KAT went offline on 20 July 2016 when the domain was seized by the U.S. government. The site's proxy servers were shut down by its staff at the same time.\n\nIn December 2016, former KAT staff members revived the KAT community by creating a website with its predecessor's features and appearance.\n\nKickassTorrents says that it complies with the DMCA and it removes infringing torrents reported by content owners.\n\nKAT was initially launched in November 2008 at the domain name kickasstorrents.com.\n\nOn 21 April 2011, KickassTorrents moved to the Philippines domain name kat.ph after a series of domain name seizures by the United States Department of Justice against Demonoid and Torrentz. The site later moved to several different domains, which the operators plan to do every six months, including ka.tt, kickass.to, kickass.so, kickasstorrents.im and kat.cr.\n\nOn 28 February 2013, Internet service providers (ISPs) in the United Kingdom were ordered by the High Court in London to block access to KickassTorrents, along with two other torrent sites. Judge Richard Arnold ruled that the site's design contributed to copyright infringement.\n\nOn 14 June 2013, the domain name was changed to Tonga domain name kickass.to as a part of the site's regular domain change.\n\nOn 23 June 2013, KAT was delisted from Google at the request of the MPAA. In late August 2013, KAT was blocked by Belgian ISPs. In January 2014, several Irish ISPs started blocking KAT. In February 2014, Twitter started blocking links to KAT, however by the end of February 2014, KAT was unblocked on Twitter. In June 2014, KAT was blocked in Malaysia by the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission for violating copyright law.\n\nIn December 2014, the site moved to the Somalia domain name kickass.so. Reports stated that it was moved as a result of site's regular domain change. On 9 February 2015, kickass.so was listed as \"banned\" on Whois, causing the site to go offline. Later that day, the site reverted to its former domain name kickass.to.\n\nOn 14 February 2015, it was found that messages mentioning \"kickass.to\" were blocked on Steam chat, but \"kickass.so\" and other popular torrent websites were not blocked, only flagged as \"potentially malicious\".\n\nOn 23 April 2015, the site moved to the Isle of Man based domain name kickasstorrents.im but was quickly taken down later that day and on 24 April it was moved to the Costa Rica based domain name kat.cr.\n\nBy July 2015, the kat.cr address had been removed from Google Search's results. After the removal, the top Google search result for KAT in many locations pointed to a fake KAT site that prompted visitors to download malware.\n\nIn October 2015, Portugal bypassed its courts by making a voluntary agreement between ISPs, rightsholders and the Ministry of Culture to block access to KAT and most of the other popular BitTorrent websites.\n\nAt the same time, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox blocked access to KAT because of security concerns with some of the ads pointing to malware. In April 2016, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox blocked KAT due to phishing concerns. Both blocks were later removed after KAT dealt with the concerns.\n\nIn June 2016, KAT added an official Tor network .onion address.\n\nOne of the main domains of the site went up for sale in August 2016.\n\nOn 20 July 2016, the United States Department of Justice announced that it had seized the KAT.cr domain and had identified its alleged owner. Artem Vaulin (), a 30-year-old Ukrainian man known online as \"tirm\", was detained in Poland after being charged with a four-count U.S. criminal indictment. The remaining domains were taken offline voluntarily after the KAT.cr domain name was seized. Following the seizure of the original KAT domain multiple unofficial mirrors have been put online. These have no connection to the original team who have been urging users to exercise caution. A number of these mirrors have since been taken down.\n\nVaulin was arrested after investigators cross-referenced an IP address he used for an iTunes transaction with an IP address used to log into KAT's Facebook page. The FBI also posed as an advertiser and obtained details of a bank account associated with the site. The investigation was led by special agent Jared Der-Yeghiayan, who also tracked down Ross Ulbricht, the operator of the online black market Silk Road.\n\nThe criminal complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois by Homeland Security Investigations, said that it was in possession of full copies of KAT's hard drives, including its email server. The investigation suggested that KAT made over $12 million per year in advertising revenue.\n\nIn late August 2016, the Department of Justice followed the complaint with a full grand jury indictment of Vaulin and two other defendants, Ievgen Kutsenko and Oleksandr Radostin; while Vaulin was still being held in Polish prison. Vaulin has both a Polish and US legal representation Ira Rothken as his lawyers to handle the allegations. In November 2016, a Polish appeals court refused to allow bail for Vaulin, stating the evidence provided by the US is sufficient to keep him in prison.\n\nIn mid-December 2016, some of the former KAT staff and moderators launched a website with a similar appearance as the original under the domain katcr.co.\n"}
{"id": "1797476", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1797476", "title": "Margot Frank", "text": "Margot Frank\n\nMargot Betti Frank (February 16, 1926 – February-March, 1945) was the eldest daughter of Otto Frank and Edith Frank and the elder sister of Anne Frank. Margot's deportation order from the Gestapo hastened the Frank family into hiding. According to the diary of her younger sister, Anne, Margot kept a diary of her own, but no trace of Margot's diary has ever been found. She died in Bergen-Belsen.\n\nMargot Betti Frank, named after maternal aunt Bettina Holländer (1898–1914), was born in Frankfurt, Germany, to Jewish parents, and lived in the outer suburbs of the city with her parents, Otto Frank and Edith Frank-Holländer, and also her younger sister Anne Frank, during the early years of her life.\n\nShe attended the Ludwig-Richter School in Frankfurt until the appointment of Adolf Hitler on January 30, 1933 to the position of chancellor in Germany brought an increase of anti-Jewish measures, among which was the expulsion of Jewish schoolchildren from non-denominational schools. In response to the rising tide of anti-semitism, the family decided to follow the 63,000 other Jews who had left Germany that year and immigrate to Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Edith Frank-Holländer and her daughters moved in with her mother in Aachen in June 1933 until Otto Frank found accommodation in Amsterdam. Margot and her mother left Germany to join him on December 5, 1933, followed by Anne in February 1934. Margot was enrolled in an elementary school on Amsterdam's Jekerstraat, close to their new address in Amsterdam South, and achieved excellent academic results until an anti-Jewish law imposed a year after the 1940 German invasion of the Netherlands demanded her removal to a Jewish lyceum. There she displayed the studiousness and intelligence which had made her noteworthy at her previous schools, and was remembered by former pupils as virtuous, reserved, and very obedient. In her diary, Anne recounted instances of their mother suggesting she emulate Margot, and although she wrote of admiring her sister in some respects for being handsome and clever, Anne sought to define her own individuality without role models. Margot is also shown to have a much better relationship with at least her mother, and had a much more modest and tolerant nature as opposed to Anne, who was determined and often spoke her mind.\n\nWhile Anne inherited her father's ambivalence towards the Torah, Margot followed her mother's example and became involved in Amsterdam's Jewish community. She took Hebrew classes, attended synagogue, and in 1941 joined a Dutch Zionist club for young people who wanted to immigrate to Palestine to found a Jewish state, where, according to Anne, she wished to become a midwife.\n\nOn July 5, 1942, she received a notice to report to a labor camp and the next day went into hiding with her family at her father's office building. They were later joined by four other Jewish refugees and remained hidden for two years until they were betrayed on August 4, 1944.\n\nAlong with the other occupants of the hiding place, Margot Frank was arrested by the Gestapo, and detained in their headquarters overnight before being taken to a cell in a nearby prison for three days. From here they were taken by train, on 8 August, to the Dutch Westerbork concentration camp. As the Frank family had failed to respond to Margot's call-up notice in 1942, and had been discovered in hiding, they (along with Fritz Pfeffer and the Van Pels family) were declared criminals by the camp's officials and detained in its punishment block to be sentenced to hard labor in the battery dismantling plant. They remained there until they were selected for Westerbork's last deportation to Auschwitz on September 3, 1944. Margot and Anne were transferred to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp on October 30, where both contracted typhus in the winter of 1944.\n\nMargot Frank died sometime in February 1945 at the age of 19 due to typhus. A few days later, Anne died due to the same illness. Janny Brandes-Brilleslijper and her sister Lientje buried them together in one of the camp's mass graves; in August 1945, once she came back to the Netherlands and recovered from typhus, Janny wrote to Otto Frank and informed him that both his daughters had died.\n\nOtto Frank was the only one to survive out of the eight people who went into hiding. When he returned to Amsterdam he was given Anne's diary by Miep Gies, which he later published as a remembrance to her. Along with Anne, Margot Frank also wrote a diary during their time in hiding (Anne mentioned her sister's diary in her diary) but Margot's diary was never found. However, many authors wrote fan-based diaries of Margot such as the novel \"The Silent Sister\" by Mazal Alouf-Mizrahi. Letters written by both Frank sisters to American pen pals were published in 2003. Buddy Elias (1925-2015) was Anne's first cousin and last surviving close relative.\n\n\n"}

Commission\n\nMicrosoft Corp v Commission (2007) T-201/04 is a case brought by the European Commission of the European Union (EU) against Microsoft for abuse of its dominant position in the market (according to competition law). It started as a complaint from Sun Microsystems over Microsoft's licensing practices in 1993, and eventually resulted in the EU ordering Microsoft to divulge certain information about its server products and release a version of Microsoft Windows without Windows Media Player. The European Commission especially focused on the interoperability issue.\n\nIn 1993, Novell claimed that Microsoft was blocking its competitors out of the market through anti-competitive practices. The complaint centered on the license practices at the time which required royalties from each computer sold by a supplier of Microsoft's operating system, whether or not the unit actually contained the Windows operating system. Microsoft reached a settlement in 1994, ending some of its license practices.\n\nIn 1998, Sun Microsystems raised a complaint about the lack of disclosure of some of the interfaces to Windows NT. The case widened when the EU examined how streaming media technologies were integrated with Windows.\n\nCiting ongoing abuse by Microsoft, the EU reached a preliminary decision in the case in 2003 and ordered the company to offer both a version of Windows without Windows Media Player and the information necessary for competing networking software to interact fully with Windows desktops and servers. In March 2004, the EU ordered Microsoft to pay €497 million ($794 million or £381 million), the largest fine ever handed out by the EU at the time, in addition to the previous penalties, which included 120 days to divulge the server information and 90 days to produce a version of Windows without Windows Media Player.\n\nThe next month Microsoft released a paper containing scathing commentary on the ruling including: \"The commission is seeking to make new law that will have an adverse impact on intellectual property rights and the ability of dominant firms to innovate.\" Microsoft paid the fine in full in July 2004.\n\nIn 2004, Neelie Kroes was appointed the European Commissioner for Competition; one of her first tasks was to oversee the fining brought onto Microsoft. Kroes has stated she believes open standards and open source are preferable to anything proprietary:\nMicrosoft has a compliant version of its flagship operating system without Windows Media Player available under the negotiated name \"Windows XP N\". In response to the server information requirement, Microsoft released the source code, but not the specifications, to Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 (SP1) to members of its Work Group Server Protocol Program (WSPP) on the day of the original deadline. Microsoft also appealed the case, and the EU had a week-long hearing over it. Neelie Kroes stated: \n\nMicrosoft stated in June 2006 that it had begun to provide the EU with the requested information, but according to the BBC the EU stated that it was too late.\n\nOn 12 July 2006, the EU fined Microsoft for an additional €280.5 million (US$448.58 million), €1.5 million (US$2.39 million) per day from 16 December 2005 to 20 June 2006. The EU threatened to increase the fine to €3 million ($4.81 million) per day on 31 July 2006 if Microsoft did not comply by then.\n\nOn 17 September 2007, Microsoft lost their appeal against the European Commission's case. The €497 million fine was upheld, as were the requirements regarding server interoperability information and bundling of Media Player. In addition, Microsoft has to pay 80% of the legal costs of the Commission, while the Commission has to pay 20% of the legal costs by Microsoft. However, the appeal court rejected the Commission ruling that an independent monitoring trustee should have unlimited access to internal company organization in the future. On 22 October 2007, Microsoft announced that it would comply and not appeal the decision any more, and Microsoft did not appeal within the required two months as of 17 November 2007.\n\nMicrosoft announced that it will demand 0.4% of the revenue (rather than 5.95%) in patent-licensing royalties, only from commercial vendors of interoperable software and promised not to seek patent royalties from individual open source developers. The interoperability information alone is available for a one-time fee of €10,000 (US$15,992).\n\nOn 27 February 2008, the EU fined Microsoft an additional €899 million (US$1.44 billion) for failure to comply with the March 2004 antitrust decision. This represented the largest penalty ever imposed in 50 years of EU competition policy until 2009, when the European Commission fined Intel €1.06 billion ($1.45 billion) for anti-competitive behaviour. This latest decision follows a prior €280.5 million fine for non-compliance, covering the period from 21 June 2006 until 21 October 2007. On 9 May 2008, Microsoft lodged an appeal in the European Court of First Instance seeking to overturn the €899 million fine, officially stating that it intended to use the action as a \"constructive effort to seek clarity from the court\".\n\nIn its 2008 Annual Report Microsoft stated:\nOn 27 June 2012, the General Court upheld the fine, but reduced it from €899 million to €860 million. The difference was due to a \"miscalculation\" by the European Commission. The commission's decision to fine Microsoft was not challenged by the court, saying the company had blocked fair access to its markets. E.U. competition commissioner, Joaquín Almunia, has said that such fines may not be effective in preventing anti-competitive behavior and that the commission now preferred to seek settlements that restrict businesses' plans instead. As such, \"The New York Times\" called the Microsoft decision \"a decision that could mark the end of an era in antitrust law in which regulators used big fines to bring technology giants to heel.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Microsoft said the company was \"disappointed with the court’s ruling\" and felt the company had \"resolved [the commissions'] competition law concerns\" in 2009, making the fine unnecessary. He declined to say whether Microsoft would file an appeal or not. Almunia called the ruling a vindication of the crackdown on Microsoft and warned \"The judgment confirms that the imposition of such penalty payments remains an important tool at the commission’s disposal.\" He also claimed that the commission's actions against Microsoft had allowed \"a range of innovative products that would otherwise not have seen the light of day\" to reach the market.\n\nThe fines will not be distributed to the companies that lost income due to Microsoft practices. The money paid in fines to the European Court goes back into the EU budget.\n\nIn May 2008, the EU announced it is going to investigate Microsoft Office's OpenDocument format support.\n\nIn January 2009, the European Commission announced it would investigate the bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows operating systems from Microsoft, saying \"Microsoft's tying of Internet Explorer to the Windows operating system harms competition between web browsers, undermines product innovation and ultimately reduces consumer choice.\" In response, Microsoft announced that it would not bundle Internet Explorer with Windows 7 E, the version of Windows 7 to be sold in Europe.\n\nOn 16 December 2009, the European Union agreed to allow competing browsers, with Microsoft providing a \"ballot box\" screen letting users choose one of twelve popular products listed in random order. The twelve browsers were\nAvant,\nChrome,\nFirefox,\nFlock,\nGreenBrowser,\nInternet Explorer,\nK-Meleon,\nMaxthon,\nOpera,\nSafari,\nSleipnir, and\nSlim which are accessible via BrowserChoice.eu. The automatic nature of the BrowserChoice.eu feature was dropped in Windows 7 Service Pack 1 in February 2011 and remained absent for 14 months despite Microsoft reporting that it was still present, subsequently described by Microsoft as a \"technical error\". As a result, in March 2013 the European Commission fined Microsoft €561 million to deter companies from reneging on settlement promises.\n\n\nTimelines:\n"}

Under the Minerals and Mining Law, mining companies must pay royalties; companies may also pay corporate taxes at standard rates. Companies are exempt from custom duties on accessories, equipment, machinery, and plants used for mining operations, but must pay local property taxes on their immovable properties. The 1986 mining law had been instrumental in attracting more than $5 billion in foreign investment to the Ghanaian mining industry between 1986 and 2002. The 1994 amendments reduced the 45% general mining corporate tax rate to 35%, which is the same as that imposed on other industries.\n\nOn December 15, 2005, the Ghanaian Parliament passed into law a new minerals and mining bill. Some of the provisions under the new Minerals and Mining Law, law No. 703, included access to mineral rights on a first-come, first-considered basis; a specific timeframe within which all applications are expected to be granted; the right for applicants to demand written reasons from the Minister if an application is rejected; the Government’s right to acquire land or authorize its occupation and use if the land is required for mining purposes; the establishment of a cadastral system for the administration of mineral rights; a provision establishing the range of royalty rates, which is not to be less than 3% or exceed 6% of total mining revenues; the Government’s right to obtain a 10% free-carried interest in mining leases; and the establishment of the period of duration of a mining lease, which is not to exceed 30 years and which may be renewed once for a period not to exceed an additional 30 years.\n\n"}

{"id": "33847678", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33847678", "title": "Mission to Prey", "text": "Mission to Prey\n\n\"Mission to Prey\" is the title of an episode of the RTÉ programme \"Prime Time Investigates\" broadcast in May 2011. It falsely accused an Irish catholic priest in Kenya of having fathered a child by engaging in child sexual abuse. It was described as \"one of the gravest editorial mistakes ever made\" in the history of RTÉ broadcasting.\n\nIn January 2011 reporter Aoife Kavanagh and producer Mark Lappin, on a research trip to Kenya, believed they had found evidence of a sexual scandal involving Fr. Kevin Reynolds, an Irish Catholic priest. Their sources accused Fr. Kevin Reynolds of raping a teenage girl and fathering her child in Kenya. The (alleged) mother of the child verified these allegations. After a second research trip by the two, the executive producer of Prime Time Investigates, the editor of current affairs, and the Managing Director of News all agreed to broadcast the programme. A later investigation identified their actions as \"groupthink\" - all members of the team responsible for the broadcast believed that Father Reynolds was guilty. The RTÉ legal department also vetted the program and, despite misgivings, agreed with broadcasting the programme. An offer by Father Reynolds to carry out a paternity test was ignored by the RTÉ team.\n\nThe programme caused uproar across Ireland when the truth was later revealed. As a result of the broadcast, Fr. Reynolds was removed from his home and from his parish ministry and his reputation was destroyed. It subsequently emerged that the allegations were baseless and that RTÉ had therefore defamed Fr. Kevin Reynolds. Director-General of RTÉ Noel Curran admitted the broadcasting of \"Mission to Prey\" was \"one of the gravest editorial mistakes ever made\" in RTÉ's history.\n\n\"Prime Times Investigates\" was initially suspended as a result of the scandal and it was later announced that the program would be terminated and replaced with a different investigative program. The fact that such damaging material could be aired on the national television network without adequate prior fact-checking caused a political scandal in Ireland, and the Irish government ordered a government inquiry into the matter (one of four separate investigations into the broadcast). RTÉ's managing director of news Ed Mulhall and current affairs editor Ken O'Shea were replaced by Cillian de Paor and Steve Carson respectively. Ed Mulhall retired, while O'Shea and others connected with the program were later assigned to other duties in RTÉ. In November 2011, the head of the Irish Missionary Union had said Kavanagh's continuing presence on \"Morning Ireland\" after being found guilty of defaming Fr. Kevin Reynolds was \"unfair and unjust\" and a demonstration of \"double standards\" in the media. However, Kavanagh waited the six months until the formal investigation report was published and resigned on the day that the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland's report was issued in May 2012.\n\nJustice Minister Alan Shatter initially supported \"Mission to Prey\" after it was broadcast in May 2011, and released a public statement of praise after it was aired, which he later retracted.\n\nAs a result of RTÉ's defamation of Fr. Kevin Reynolds, the family of a deceased Christian Brother, accused by RTÉ in the same \"Mission to Prey\" programme of having abused children, asked that his name also be cleared. There were calls for RTÉ to justify all allegations it had made against missionaries and there was a \"danger that the national broadcaster could be damaged far beyond what is necessary\".\n\nRTÉ refused to accept DNA evidence that Fr Reynolds was innocent and he was forced to take action. After the High Court found that the accusations were baseless and defamatory RTÉ were forced into apologizing to Fr Reynolds and paying substantial damages.\n\nThere was a \"public backlash\" over the standard of the televised apology. Among the most outspoken critics of RTÉ's botched apology was Fr. Sean McDonagh of the Association of Catholic Priests. RTÉ staff also expressed their ire during a showdown with Noel Curran. RTÉ rebroadcast the apology to Fr. Kevin Reynolds after the \"Nine O'Clock News\" on 25 November 2011 which it described as \"in response to concerns expressed by viewers\".\n\nRTÉ staff, including Mike Murphy, John Bowman and Sean O'Rourke, publicly criticised the serious libel.\n\nRTÉ was fined €200,000 by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) as a result of the defamation of Fr Kevin Reynolds following what the BAI said were serious breaches of the Broadcasting Act 2009. The BAI's report found that \"Second-hand repetition of gossip appears to have been treated as corroboration, as Ms Kavanagh did not appear to have met or questioned colleagues who according to the primary source, were aware of the allegations\". Aoife Kavanagh resigned from RTÉ on 4 May 2012.\n\nRichard Anthony Burke was accused in the same program of underage sex in Nigeria. He sued RTÉ for libel in 2015, claiming he and the accuser had only had adult consensual sex. RTÉ settled out of court, claiming to have paid part of Burke's costs but no damages.\n\n"}

The legislation was aimed at ensuring a stable market supply, and to provide cost-effective arbitration for vaccine injury claims. Under the NCVIA, the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP) was created to provide a federal no-fault system for compensating vaccine-related injuries or death by establishing a claim procedure involving the United States Court of Federal Claims and special masters.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, a controversy erupted related to the question of whether the whole-cell pertussis component caused permanent brain injury in rare cases, called pertussis vaccine encephalopathy. No studies showed a causal connection, and later studies showed no connection of any type between the DPT vaccine and permanent brain injury. The alleged vaccine-induced brain damage proved to be an unrelated condition, infantile epilepsy. In 1990, the \"Journal of the American Medical Association\" called the connection a \"myth\" and \"nonsense\". However, before that point, criticism of the studies showing no connection and a few well-publicized anecdotal reports of permanent disability that were blamed on the DPT vaccine gave rise to 1970s anti-DPT movements. In the United States, low profit margins and an increase in vaccine-related lawsuits led many manufacturers to stop producing the DPT vaccine by the early 1980s. By 1985, vaccine manufacturers had difficulty obtaining liability insurance. The price of DPT vaccine skyrocketed, leading providers to curtail purchases, limiting availability. Only one company was still manufacturing pertussis vaccine in the US by the end of 1985. In 1986, to correct the situation, Congress passed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA), which established a federal no-fault system to compensate victims of injury caused by mandated vaccines.\n\nThe NCVIA also mandates that all health care providers must report certain adverse events following vaccination to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).\n\nThe NCVIA also established a committee from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to review the existing literature on vaccine adverse events occurring after immunization, regardless of whether there was a direct link between events.\n\nAs a result of the NCVIA, the National Vaccine Program Office (NVPO) was established within the DHHS. The NVPO is responsible for coordinating immunization-related activities between all DHHS agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).\n\nThe NCVIA requires that all health care providers who administer vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b and varicella must provide a Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) to the vaccine recipient, their parent or legal guardian prior to each dose.\n\nA VIS must be given with every vaccination, including each dose in a multi-dose series. Each VIS contains a brief description of the disease, as well as the risks and benefits of the vaccine. Each VIS is developed by the CDC and distributed to state and local health departments as well as individual providers.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "43620318", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43620318", "title": "Platformism", "text": "Platformism\n\nPlatformism is a tendency (or organized school of thought) within the anarchist movement. It stresses the need for tightly organized anarchist organizations that are able to influence working class and peasant movements.\n\n\"Platformist\" groups reject the model of Leninist vanguardism. They instead aim to \"make anarchist ideas the leading ideas within the class struggle\". According to platformists, the four main principles by which an anarchist organisation should operate, are ideological unity, tactical unity, collective responsibility and federalism.\n\nIn general, platformist groups aim to win the widest possible influence for anarchist ideas and methods in the working class and peasantry—like especifismo groups, platformists orient towards the working class, rather than to the far-left. This usually entails a willingness to work in single-issue campaigns, trade unionism and community groups; and to fight for immediate reforms while linking this to a project of building popular consciousness and organisation. They therefore reject approaches that they believe will prevent this, such as insurrectionary anarchism, as well as \"views that dismiss activity in the unions\" or that dismiss anti-imperialist movements.\n\nThe name \"platformist\" derives from the 1926 \"Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)\". This was published by the Group of Russian Anarchists Abroad, in their journal \"Dielo Truda\" (\"Workers' Cause\" in Russian). The group, which consisted of exiled Russian anarchist veterans of the 1917 October Revolution (notably Nestor Makhno who played a leading role in the anarchist revolution in Ukraine of 1918–1921), based the \"Platform\" on their experiences of the revolution and the eventual victory of the Bolsheviks over the anarchists and other groups. The \"Platform\" attempted to address and explain the anarchist movement's failures during the Russian Revolution outside Ukraine. The document drew praise and criticism from anarchists worldwide and sparked a major debate within the anarchist movement.\n\nToday platformism is an important current in international anarchism. Around thirty platformist and especifista organisations are linked together in the Anarkismo.net project, including groups from Africa, Latin America, North America and Europe. At least in terms of the number of affiliated organisations (if not in actual membership in some countries), the Anarkismo network is larger than other anarchist international bodies, like the synthesist International of Anarchist Federations and the anarcho-syndicalist International Workers' Association. However, it is not a formal \"international\" and has no intention of competing with these other formations.\n\nThe \"Platform\" describes four key organisational features which distinguish platformism:\n\nThe \"Platform\" argues that \"[w]e have vital need of an organisation which, having attracted most of the participants in the anarchist movement, would establish a common tactical and political line for anarchism and thereby serve as a guide for the whole movement\". In short, unity meant unity of ideas and actions as opposed to unity on the basis of the anarchist label.\n\nThe \"Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)\" was written in 1926 by the Group of Russian Anarchists Abroad, a group of exiled Russian and Ukrainian anarchists in France who published the \"Dielo Truda\" journal. The pamphlet is an analysis of basic anarchist beliefs, a vision of an anarchist society and recommendations as to how an anarchist organisation should be structured.\n\nThe authors of the \"Platform\" insisted that its basic ideas were not new, but had a long anarchist pedigree. Platformism is not therefore a revision away from classical anarchism, or a new approach, but a \"restatement\" of existing positions.\n\nThey cited Peter Kropotkin arguing that \"the formation of an anarchist organisation in Russia, far from being prejudicial to the common revolutionary task, on the contrary it is desirable and useful to the very greatest degree\" and argued that Mikhail Bakunin's \"aspirations concerning organisations, as well as his activity\" in the First International, \"give us every right to view him as an active partisan of just such an organisation\". Indeed, \"practically all active anarchist militants fought against all dispersed activity, and desired an anarchist movement welded by unity of ends and means\".\n\nThe \"Platform\" used to be known in English as the \"Organisational Platform of the Libertarian Communists\", a result of its having been translated from the French edition popularized in the early 1970s. In his book \"Facing the Enemy: A history of Anarchist Organization from Proudhon to May 1968\" (p. 131), Alexandre Skirda attributes much of the controversy about the \"Platform\" to the original 1926 French translation made by its opponent Voline. Later translations to French have corrected some of the mistranslations and the latest English translation, made directly from the Russian original, reflects this.\n\nSome platformist organisations today are unhappy with the designation, often preferring to use descriptions such as \"anarchist communist\", \"social anarchist\", \"libertarian communist/socialist\" or even especifist. Most agree that the 1926 \"Platform\" was sorely lacking in certain areas and point out that it was a draft document, never intended to be adopted in its original form. The Italian Federation of Anarchist Communists (FdCA), for example, do not insist on the principle of \"tactical unity\", which according to them is impossible to achieve over a large area, preferring instead \"tactical homogeneity\".\n\nToday there are organisations inspired by the \"Platform\" in many countries, including:\n\nOrganisations inspired by the \"Platform\" were also among the founders of the now-defunct International Libertarian Solidarity network and its successor, the Anarkismo network, which is run collaboratively by roughly 30 platformist and especifista organisations around the world.\n\nThe \"Platform\" attracted strong criticism from some sectors on the anarchist movement of the time, including some of the most influential anarchists such as Voline, Errico Malatesta, Luigi Fabbri, Camillo Berneri, Max Nettlau, and Alexander Berkman, Emma Goldman and Gregori Maximoff.\n\nAs an alternative to platformism Voline and Sébastien Faure proposed synthesist anarchist federations, which they envisioned to form under the principles of anarchism without adjectives.\n\nIn place of the \"Platform's\" stress on tight political and organisational unity, the \"synthesist\" approach argued for a far looser organization that would maximise numbers i.e. a big tent approach. Platformists view such organisations as weak despite their numbers as the lack of common views means an inability to undertake common actions—defeating the purpose of a common organisation.\n\nWhile such criticisms indicated a direct rejection of the \"Platform's\" proposals, others seem to have arisen from misunderstandings.\n\nNotably, Malatesta initially believed that the \"Platform\" was \"typically authoritarian\" and \"far from helping to bring about the victory of anarchist communism, to which they aspire, could only falsify the anarchist spirit and lead to consequences that go against their intentions\".\n\nHowever, after further correspondence with Makhno—and after seeing a platformist group in formation—Malatesta concluded that he was actually in agreement with the positions of the \"Platform\", but had been confused by the language they had used: But all this is perhaps only a question of words.<br>\n<br>\nIn my reply to Makhno I already said: \"It may be that, by the term collective responsibility, you mean the agreement and solidarity that must exist among the members of an association. And if that is so, your expression would, in my opinion, amount to an improper use of language, and therefore, being only a question of words, we would be closer to understanding each other.\"<br>\n<br>\nAnd now, reading what the comrades of the 18e say, I find myself more or less in agreement with their way of conceiving the anarchist organisation (being very far from the authoritarian spirit which the \"Platform\" seemed to reveal) and I confirm my belief that behind the linguistic differences really lie identical positions.\n\n\n"}

Although Gaius only identifies a single type of contract \"in re\", it is commonly thought that there were four, as Justinian identifies: \"mutuum\" (loan for consumption), \"commodatum\" (loan for use), \"depositum\" (deposit) and \"pignus\" (pledge).\n\nEach varied about the expected standards of care, transfer of ownership, and other practicalities stemming from the purpose of each. They all involved the delivery or a physical thing, which is a defining characteristic. They were generally supplemented by the \"stipulatio\" and inominate contract, which allowed additional provisions such as interests to be added to contracts \"in re\" making them more suitable for commercial applications.\n\nJustinian identifies four types of real contract – contracts \"in re\" (in a thing) – \"mutuum\", \"commodatum\", \"depositum\" and \"pignus\". Common to all four was an agreement, and the delivery of a \"res corporalis\". They are in contrast to consensual and inominate contracts. Real contracts were of limited significance, although they are featured prominently in the works of jurists. If a \"stipulatio\" had to be created to cover any interest, then it could be used to cover the other elements of the transaction as well.\n\nGaius, however, only mentions one type of contract \"in re\": \"mutuum\". The others certainly existed in Gaius' time. The other three can be distinguished insofar as they are different from traditional concepts of debt from which real contracts developed, are bilateral, do not transfer ownership, are \"bona fide\" and praetorian in nature. Gaius can therefore be seen as writing at a developing time in the law, although why the others are not mentioned at all in the \"Institutes of Gaius\" is not known.\n\nA \"mutuum\" was a loan for consumption. It was the oldest contract \"in re\", growing in importance after 326 BC when the lex Poetalia was passed. It could be used by people without the right of \"commercium\" – a package of rights to participate in the \"ius civile\" and to undertake remedies. It involved the delivery of certain types of fungible goods, such as money, food, and drink. Ownership was transferred, as was possession. In a strict sense then, because ownership passed, it should not be considered a loan. The \"mutuum\" obliged the borrower not to return the thing itself, because its use would involve consumption, but a similar thing in quantity, quality and size.\n\nThe lender had a \"condictio\" action for the value of the thing if a similar thing was not returned as described. It was \"stricti iuris\" (\"strict law\") – the lender could not claim interest. Despite this, it became the standard arrangement for moneylenders in the Roman republic. Interest would instead have to be given in a \"stipulatio\", an additional contract. Rates of interest were heavily regulated by the state. As a \"mutuum\" did not place on the borrower any specific date on which to return the equivalent thing, this would also be given in a \"stipulatio\" if required. In the later law, the \"stipulatio\" replaced \"mutuum\" completely.\n\nThe borrower was bound to return the equivalent thing. As owner, he bore liability for loss, theft, or damage; they were irrelevant to his liability for the thing. Two exceptions were made, where repayment would be dependent on the success of the operation: the financing of a cargo ship, and the sponsorship of a professional athlete. Neither was liable if they did not succeed; the risk was born by the lender. \"Mutuum\" was unilateral and did not place the lender under any obligations or duties.\n\nA \"commodatum\" was a loan for use. It did not transfer ownership nor possession, and was also gratuitous (no interest could be charged). If interest was included, the agreement was instead either one of hire or an innominate contract. It was assumed to be for a \"reasonable time\" if this was not specified at the time of the agreement. Land could be the subject of a \"commodatum\" during the Classical period and later, though this was doubted before that. Perishables could not be loaned for use, unless they were to be used for display purposes only, or a small number of other exceptions. The lender under a \"commodatum\" did not have to be owner, since ownership was not transferred.\n\nA borrower was held (in most juristic texts) to a standard of \"culpa levis in abstracto\" – the borrower was liable if his or her conduct fell short of the \"diligentia\" (care) of a \"bonus paterfamilias\" – a good, respected, head of the family. Some commentators consider the relevant standard to have instead been that of a \"diligentissimus paterfamilias\" (\"most careful head-of-family\"), a higher standard. This may have developed from an earlier standard of \"custodia\". \"Custodia\" was a form of strict liability, where the only situation when the borrower would not be liable would be actions of a \"greater force\" (\"vis maior\") such a theft with force, or what is called in the modern English law and act of God. If the borrower was liable, then he had an action available against the thief (the \"actio furti\") or damager under the Lex Aquilia. Where the borrower was liable, Justinian at least gave the lender the choice of whether to sue the borrower \"in personam\" in breach of contract, or the thief or damager. The borrower was also liable for \"furtum\" if he misused the thing he had borrowed. If the borrowed thing had undisclosed defects which caused damage of which the lender was aware, then the lender would be liable under delict. The appropriate action for breach of contract was the \"actio commodati\". If the lender owed the borrower money relating to another contract or sale, then he could keep the borrowed thing and offset the cost against the debt He could also bring the \"actio commodati contraria\" if his expenses exceeded the value of the property borrowed.\n\nA \"depositum\" was a deposit for safekeeping. It did not transfer ownership nor possession, and was also gratuitous. Land could not be the subject of a deposit. If interest was included, then the deposit became a contract of hire. Since ownership did not pass, a thief could deposit. The depositee could not benefit from the deposit in any way. If the depositee used the thing, then this was considered theft by \"furtum usus\".\n\nIt appears that the depositee was held to \"culpa lata\" standard. This meant that the depositee was liable if found to have been grossly negligent: careless to the extent that bad faith could almost be assumed. \"Culpa lata\" was therefore similar to \"dolus\" (\"fraud\"). Indeed, some commentators consider \"dolus\" to be the appropriate standard. The parties could agree to vary the level of care expected of the depositee. A depositee was expected to return the thing on demand. Reasonable \"wear and tear\" was acceptable. The depositee was also bound to hand over any accretions of the thing, such as any young born to a deposited animal. The depositor was liable for any damage caused by the deposited thing, and the cost of transportation if the place that the things was to be returned differed from that where it was borrowed. The \"actio depositi\" was available to the depositor to seek return of his goods, with double damages awarded if the damage had been made in an emergency, such as during fire or riot. It resulted in \"infamia\" if the depositee was held liable. The depositee had the \"actio depositi contraria\" if expenses were paid. Originally, it seems that the expenses could be set against the value of the thing in the \"actio depositi\", but, if so, this ability came to an end in the time of Justinian.\n\nThere were two special types of deposit. The first was the \"depositum irregulare\" of fungibles, normally money. In contrast to a usual deposit, ownership did pass, granting more rights to the depositee to protect the property. It had to be returned on request, and the transferee could derive no benefit from it. The second was \"sequestrio\", whereby a thing whose ownerhsip was disputed was deposited with a third party, bound to return it to the successful party in a \"vindicatio\" or similar action. Because possession passed, both parties were prevented from usucapting until the disagreement was settled. It could be used in relation to land or movables.\n\nA \"pignus\" (\"pledge\") was a form of real security which transferred possession but not ownership. It often formed part of a mortgage or similar transaction.\n\nIt developed later than the similar \"fiducia\", where ownership was transferred as well as possession. Accordingly, the thing could be sold by the owner and deducted from the debt without recourse to the pledgor, and whilst it was owned by pledgee the pledgor had no right of use. It also required a formal conveyance. This is in contrast to the \"pignus\", which could be carried out by \"traditio\". \"Fiducia\" remained popular with lenders who enjoyed increased security, whereas a \"pignus\" was more useful to the pledger. \"Fiducia\" lasted until the late empire, but was increasingly eclipsed by \"pignus\".\n\nThe pledgee, if he was in physical control of the object (as was usually the case) was required to safeguard the thing. Like the borrower, a pledgee was held to the \"culpa levis in abstracto\" standard; again, this may have developed from \"custodia\". The pledgor was liable for damage done by his thing deposited, if he acted without the care of a \"bonus paterfamilias\". If the pledgee fell short of the expected standard, the contract was terminated immediately. The pledgee could claim for expenses incurred in maintaining the thing (such as an animal or slave). The pledgee had to set any profits derived from the thing against the outstanding debt. The pledge was repaid when the debt was settled, along with any accretions. The pledgor had no action without repayment. The pledgee did not have ownership, and therefore could not sell or destroy the thing, which was restrictive. A right of sale was typically agreed between the parties, to come into effect after a set time. So common was this that it was often considered implied. The amount would be deducted from the debt, interest and expenses added, and this could then be sued for under whichever contract had formed the debt.\n\n"}

{"id": "4243356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4243356", "title": "Rio Grande Compact", "text": "Rio Grande Compact\n\nThe Rio Grande Compact is an interstate compact signed in 1938 in the United States between the states of Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas, and approved by the United States Congress, to equitably apportion the waters of the Rio Grande Basin.\n\nThe treaty was ratified by Colorado's legislature on February 21, 1939, then by Texas and New Mexico's legislatures on March 1. It was finally adopted on December 19, 1939 after passing through Congress (as Public Act No. 96, 76) and being signed into law on May 31, 1939.\n\nThe act was amended at the thirteenth Annual Meeting, on February 25, 1952.\n\nColorado committed to deliver a certain amount of water to the New Mexico state line, based on water runoff as measured at four index stations located in the area of the Rio Grande's headwaters. The compact provides for an indexed schedule of required water deliveries from Colorado, based on gauged stream flows, and, under certain circumstances, a system of debits and credits in water deliveries that also permits water storage with the combined capacity of Elephant Butte and Caballo Reservoirs.\n\nThe compact also sets a minimum quality standard, as in the event that Colorado was to construct water projects later for the purpose of delivering water into the Rio Grande from the Closed Basin, the state would not be credited with the water delivered unless the sodium ions in the water do not exceed 45% of the total positive ions when the total dissolved solids in the water exceeds 350ppm.\n\nBetween 1939-1966, Colorado virtually ignored the compact. The result was that by 1966, due to Colorado's non-compliance with the Compact, Colorado owed New Mexico one-million acre feet (1.2 km³) of water, and New Mexico owed Texas . New Mexico and Texas collectively sued Colorado to try to force compliance, and between 1966–1967, the case progressed and was eventually heard by the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\nIn 1985, after several affluent years of water flow from the Rio Grande, the Elephant Butte and Caballo reservoirs reached capacity, having received more water than they could hold. The terms of the Compact state that once the Elephant Butte reservoir is filled, New Mexico and Colorado are immediately released from any water debt they have accrued. Colorado's debt to New Mexico at the time, of water, was immediately cleared, settling the balance between the two states, but leaving New Mexico in an unfortunate position in its debt to Texas.\n\nIn 1996, when the reservoir was again close to capacity, the New Mexico water districts below Elephant Butte authorized water from the reservoir to be pulled out and dumped in the New Mexico desert, to prevent the reservoir from spilling, and again clearing Colorado's water debt.\n\nThe stress now is on New Mexico to meet its obligations to Texas. During dryer years, New Mexico will be short about in its obligations, partially due to partial evaporation of the reservoir water before New Mexico can absorb it.\n\nThe Rio Grande Compact Commission, located in El Paso, Texas, administers the Rio Grande Compact. An employee of the USGS New Mexico Water Science Center serves as Secretary to the Compact. The principal duty of the Secretary is to compile streamflow and storage data used in the annual accounting computations performed by the Commission’s Engineer Advisers. The Secretary also compiles provisional streamflow and storage data on a monthly basis that are distributed to interested parties, and compiles and publishes an annual data report for the Commission.\n\nThe Texas Commission on Environmental Quality is Texas' representation to the Commission.\n\nDuring a 1999 United States House of Representatives investigation of inter-state water pacts, Bennett W. Raley offered testimony revealing that efforts to comply with the demands of the Compact could be threatening a critical habitat for the Rio Grande Silvery Minnow.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "216412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=216412", "title": "Roerich Pact", "text": "Roerich Pact\n\nThe Treaty on the Protection of Artistic and Scientific Institutions and Historic Monuments or Roerich Pact is an inter-American treaty. The most important idea of the Roerich Pact is the legal recognition that the defense of cultural objects is more important than the use or destruction of that culture for military purposes, and the protection of culture always has precedence over any military necessity.\n\nRussian painter and philosopher Nicholas Roerich (1874–1947) initiated the modern movement for the defense of cultural objects, for the idea of \"Peace of Civilizations\". Besides the recognition as one of the greatest Russian painters, Roerich's most notable achievement during his lifetime was the Roerich Pact signed on 15 April 1935 by the representatives of American states in the Oval Office of the White House (Washington, DC). It was the first international treaty signed in the Oval Office.\n\nNicholas Roerich was born on 9 October 9, 1874, in St. Petersburg. His parents encouraged him to study law, but seeing their son's inclination for painting, they allowed him to study both, which he did with much success. In 1900, Roerich went to Paris to take lessons from Fernand Cormon, the well known tutor of Van Gogh and Toulouse-Lautrec. Upon his return to St. Petersburg, he married Helena Shaposhnikova, who later developed the Agni Yoga philosophy. Soon Roerich became quite a successful painter. One of his paintings was purchased by Russian Tsar Nicolas II himself. Roerich also worked as stage and costume designer for several operas and ballets by Maurice Maeterlinck and Igor Stravinsky, premiered in St. Petersburg.\n\nIn 1917 Roerich went to live near a lake in Finland, to strengthen his health. After the border between Russia and Finland was closed in 1918 in the context of the October Revolution and Finnish Civil War, the family travelled across several Scandinavian countries to Great Britain and eventually left for North America in 1920. There, Roerich founded two cultural institutions: \"Cor Ardens\" (Flaming Heart, a fraternity of artists from several countries) and \"The Master Institute of United Arts\" (an organization for education, science, and philosophy).\n\nIn 1923, the Roerich Museum was founded in New York. In 1929, it moved to a new building. Presently, the Roerich Museum is located in Manhattan, at the corner of 107th Street and Riverside Drive. In 1929, Roerich's work towards the pact was recognised through a nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize.\nAfter leaving America, the Roerichs settled at Naggar in the Kullu Valley from which their estate looked towards the Himalayas. Here they established the Urusvati Institute which remains in Naggar with an exhibition about the pact. Nicholas Roerich died of a cardiac arrest on 13 December 1947.\n\nAn idea about the protection of cultural monuments was formulated for the first time by N.K. Roerich in 1899. During his excavations at Saint-Petersburg province, Roerich began to point to the necessity of protection of cultural monuments, which reproduce a world-view of ancient people for us.\n\nIn 1903, Roerich together with his wife Helena Ivanovna Roerich toured through forty ancient Russian cities, including Yaroslavl, Kostroma, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod, Vladimir, Suzdal, Yuriev-Polsky, Smolensk, Vilnius, Izborsk and Pskov. In 1904, proceeding the expedition, N.K.Roerich has visited Uglich, Kalyazin, Kashin and Tver. During these travels Roerich created a large series of architectural studies, created near 90 paintings of the visited sites. Later many Russian churches were destroyed and these paintings remain the only documenting images.\n\nSummarizing this trips, the painter admired the beauty of the ancient monuments. Roerich, expressing his feelings for the state of their protection, in his article \"Along the old times\" (1903): \"Last summer I had an occasion to see many our true antique and little love to it\".\n\nIn 1904, Roerich gave a report to the Emperor's Russian Archeologist Society about the sad state of historical monuments and the necessity to take prompt actions to protect them.\n\nDuring the Russian-Japan war (1904–1905), Roerich expressed an idea about the necessity of a special treaty for the protection of institutions and cultural monuments. In the course of several years after his travel in 1903-1904, Roerich repeatedly pointed out the state of antique monuments. He wrote several articles dedicated to the poor state of the churches. In the article \"Silent Pogroms\" (1911) Roerich wrote about the unskillful restoration of St. John the Forerunner Church at Yaroslavl: \"Who would defense a beautiful antique from mad pogroms? It is grievously when the antique dies. But it is more terrible when the antique remains disfigured, false, imitation...\".\n\nIn 1914, Roerich appealed to the high command of the Imperial Russian army, as well as the governments of the United States and France with an idea of conclusion of an international agreement aimed on the protection of cultural values during armed conflicts. He created a poster \"Enemy of Mankind\" denouncing the barbaric destruction of cultural monuments, and picture \"Glow\" expressing a protest against World War I.\n\nIn 1915, Roerich wrote a report for Russian Emperor Nicholas II and Great Prince Nicholas Nikolayevich containing an appeal to make real state measures for national protection of cultural values.\n\nIn 1929, Roerich, in cooperation with G.G. Shklyaver (a.k.a. Georges Chklaver), a doctor of international law and political sciences at Paris University prepared a project of the Pact for protection of cultural values. Simultaneously Roerich proposed a distinctive sign to identify the objects that are in need of protection – the Banner of Peace. It represents a white cloth with a red circle and three red circles inscribed in it.\n\nIn 1929 Roerich in collaboration with Paris University professor G.G. Shklyaver (a.k.a. Georges Chklaver) prepared a draft of an international treaty dedicated to protection of cultural values. The scheme was to be a cultural analog to the Red Cross for medical neutrality.\n\nIn 1930, text of draft agreement with accompanying Roerich's appeal to governments and peoples of all countries was published in press and distributed in government, scientific, artistic and educational institutions of the whole world. As a result, the committees supporting the Pact were established in many countries. The draft pact was approved by Committee for Museum affairs at League of Nations and also by the Committee of the Pan-American Union. Ultimately, the Pact was signed by 21 states in the Americas and was ratified by ten of them.\n\nIn the aftermath of World War II, the Roerich Pact played an important role in forming of international law standards and public activity in the field of protection of cultural heritage. In 1949, at the fourth UNESCO General Conference, a decision was accepted to begin the work for international law regulation in the field of cultural heritage protection in case of armed conflict.\n\nIdeas of Roerich Pact still are not implemented in the international law, especially its principle of the almost unlimited preference of the preservation of cultural values to the military necessity.\n\n1930 – A project together with N. Roerich's covering appeal to governments and peoples of all the countries was published and communicated to the governments, scientific, artistic and educational institutions of the world.\n\n1931 – An International Union of the Roerich Pact was founded at Bruges under the guidance of a member of Belgium Committee for monument protection .\n\n1932, 7–9 September - second International conference dedicated to the Roerich Pact had been organized at Bruges. Twenty two countries took part in its work. The Conference has resolved to found at Bruges a special institute for world assistance to implementation of the Roerich Pact ideas in public life. It also took a decision to appeal to all the countries to recognize the Pact as international treaty.\n\n1933, 15 November – Organizing Committee of third international Conference dedicated to the Roerich Pact visited the USA President F. Roosevelt.\n\n1934, 4 April – A report of special committee of Pan-American Union dedicated to Roerich Pact was approved.\n\n1935, 15 April – A Treaty named \"international pact for protection of artistic and scientific institutions, historic monuments, missions and collections\" (Roerich Pact) is concluded and signed by representatives of 21 American states at the White House, Washington. A distinctive sign for identification of the protected objects (Banner of Peace) proposed by Roerich was approved in the frameworks of the Pact.\n\nPresident F. Roosevelt talked in his radio speech:\n\"Presenting this Pact for signing by all the countries, we strive for that its world acceptance becomes a vital principle for preserving of modern civilization. This agreement has more profound significance than the text of this document\" [1].\n\n1937, October – First Congress of Baltic Roerich societies has resolved to create the committees of Roerich Pact in all Roerich societies of Baltic countries.\n\n1938, 17 November – the Banner of Peace was spread out in Karachi (India).\n\n1942 – The American-Russian culture association (ARCA) was formed in New York. Ernest Hemingway, Charlie Chaplin, Rockwell Kent, Norman Bel Geddes, Edmund Cooper, Serge Koussevitzky, Valeriy Ivanovich Tereshchenko were its active contributors. The association's activity was welcomed by world-known scientists Robert Andrews Millikan and Arthur Compton.\n\n1946, 23 January – first meeting of resumed New York Committee of the Pact and Banner of Peace has been conducted.\n\n1948, August – Indian government headed by Jawaharlal Nehru has decided to approve the Roerich Pact.\n\n1948-1949 – Italian association of Roerich Pact at Bologna has organized the work to support the Pact on a broad footing. Committees of the Roerich Pact and Banner of Peace worked in Italy, Belgium, Switzerland, France, England, Portugal, Brazil, Columbia, Uruguay, Bolivia and Cuba.\n\n1949 – 4th UNESCO general conference has taken a decision to begin a work for international-law regulation in the field of cultural values protection during the military actions.\n\n1950 – A New York Committee of the Roerich Pact has transferred all the documentation about the Pact to UNESCO. 5th session of general UNESCO conference entrusted the general director with preparation and sending of a draft of convention. Special committee of UNESCO has prepared the draft of international convention in view of given documents.\n\n1954, 14 May –U.N.O and UNESCO Conference in Hague has accepted the \"Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict\" and a protocol accompanying it. The Second protocol to the Hague convention was accepted in March 1999 due to initiative and close participation of UNESCO. A text of the Hague convention pointed directly on that the base for it acceptance is a principle of cultural values protection during the war established at the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 and also in the Roerich Pact. This Hague convention was signed by representatives from 37 countries.\n\n1970, 14 November – \"UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property\" was accepted at 16th session of general UNESCO conference in Paris.\n\n1972, 23 November – \"Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage\" was accepted at 17th session of general UNESCO conference in Paris.\n\n1974 – Alpinists from Novosibirsk hoisted the Banner of Peace on the Roerich peak near Belukha Mountain (Altai).\n\n1988, 6 May – Banner of Peace was hoisted at North Pole.\n\n1990, 11 February – Soviet cosmonauts Aleksandr Balandin and Anatoly Solovyev took the Banner of Peace on the board of orbital station \"Mir\".\n\n1995, 26 June – Banner of Peace was presented to Gebhardt von Moltke, deputy of secretary for political questions at NATO headquarters in Brussels.\n\n1997 – Banner of Peace was given to the crew of Soviet orbital station \"Soyuz-TM\" in the frameworks of scientific-enlightener project \"Banner of Peace\". It was delivered to orbital station \"Mir\" and remains in cosmos during two years (August 5, 1997 – August 28, 1999), accompanying the work of international crews.\n\n1998, 9 October – Banner of Peace was hoisted over the Centre-Museum named after N. Roerich in Moscow.\n\n1999, 5 January – Banner of Peace was presented to President of Kazakhstan Republic Nursultan Nazarbayev at President Palace (Almaty). Cosmonaut Alexey Leonov and Professor Sergey Kapitsa took part in the ceremony.\n- 26 March – Second protocol to \"Convention for protection of cultural values in case of armed conflict\" (Hague, 1954) was signed in Hague. The document was written by six languages: English, Arabic, Spanish, Chinese, Russian and French.\n\n2000, 8 January – Banner of Peace was established at Southern Pole.\n\n2003, 17 October – The Convention about protection of non-material cultural heritage was accepted by 32nd session of the General UNESCO conference.\n\n2004, 25 October – Banner of Peace from the board of cosmic station \"Mir\" was presented to Speaker of Indian Parliament Sri Somnath Chatterjee on the occasion of 100th Sviatoslav Roerich's Anniversary.\n\n\"Pax Cultura\" (\"Cultural Peace\" or \"Peace through Culture\") is the motto of the cultural artifact protection movement founded by Nicholas Roerich, and is symbolized by a maroon on white emblem consisting of three solid circles in a surrounding circle. On April 15, 1935 the Roerich Pact was signed by the United States and Latin American nations, agreeing that \"historic monuments, museums, scientific, artistic, educational and cultural institutions\" should be protected both in times of peace and war, and identified by their flying a distinctive flag, the \"Banner of Peace\", bearing the Pax Cultura emblem.\n\nAccording to the Roerich Museum, \"The Banner of Peace symbol has ancient origins. Perhaps its earliest known example appears on Stone Age amulets: three dots, without the enclosing circle. Roerich came across numerous later examples in various parts of the world, and knew that it represented a deep and sophisticated understanding of the triune nature of existence. But for the purposes of the Banner and the Pact, Roerich described the circle as representing the totality of culture, with the three dots being Art, Science, and Religion, three of the most embracing of human cultural activities. He also described the circle as representing the eternity of time, encompassing the past, present, and future. The sacred origins of the symbol, as an illustration of the trinities fundamental to all religions, remain central to the meaning of the Pact and the Banner today.\"\n\nThe Roerich Pact sign was superseded by the distinctive marking of cultural property as defined by the Hague Convention of 1954. However, the emblem of the Roerich Pact is still a valid protective sign in the relations between the ten states which are bound by the Pact.\n\nThe Roerich Pact is not only a relatively short multilateral treaty: it is a conglomerate of legal ideas about a new state order in which the state and the culture closely overlap. A measure of this complexity is the share of state budget annually spent on culture, art and\neducation, which in many countries exceeds military expenses.\n\nImportant in the framework of ideas of the Roerich Pact is the recognition that the safety of any foreign cultural object on the territory of a foreign state must be also respected and treated as a factor much higher in significance than military willingness to bomb, destroy or use it for military purposes.\n\nNicholas Roerich managed to continue and develop into a profound and feasible doctrine the famous maxim proclaimed by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, \"Beauty will save the World!\" Hence starts a very powerful Russian movement in the development of the concept of aesthetical statehood. The concept of the state as a work of art was first suggested in the 19th century by Jacob Burckhardt, who was Swiss historian of art, specializing in Italian Renaissance, and who gave this name to a chapter of one of his books. The concept itself had not been formulated to a completion and was expressed in a general idea that period, as well as their rulers, considered the achievements in culture and art as most important for securing the prestige both of their states and their own, which finally resulted in the unique Italian Renaissance art, literature, philosophy and science. Roerich produced ideas based on the approaches used by Burkhardt and Dostoevsky.\n\nRoerich, considered the care for future generations to be a cornerstone of the existence of the rule of law and the constitutional state. President of the USA, Franklin D. Roosevelt, in the speech upon the signature of the 'Roerich Pact' Treaty said: \"In opening this Pact to the adherence of the Nations of the world, we are endeavoring to make of universal application one of the principles vital to the preservation of modern civilization. This Treaty possesses a spiritual significance far deeper than the text of the instrument itself. It is important to realize that the Roerich Pact was only the first step towards the future development of a new legal culture. All written laws must conform to the universal unwritten principles of morality, fairness, and justice, equality, autonomy, dignity, and respect that is known as a higher law theory. The concrete conceptual provisions of Roerich's philosophical and legal concept of the state are based on the one of Rule According to Higher Law ideas that the primary duty of the state is to sustain and develop the spiritual unity of its citizens, by carefully preserving the best specimens of national cultural heritage, promoting universal culture and spiritual growth of all people, especially the young ones. At that, the major share of profits received by the state should be directed at the development of culture, which, as it was already mentioned, would lead to a further growth of economical prosperity.\n\nAccording to Roerich's concept, the state, as an instrument for the preservation and development of culture, the instrument defending both domestic and foreign cultural treasures, the instrument maintaining peace and avoiding wars, the instrument building a new civilization, based on the best cultural traditions of today and, therefore, spending the utmost economically reasonable assets for these purposes — all this can be explicitly and exclusively based on constitutional foundation.\n\nIn the broad sense the Roerich Pact is understood as not only a legal treaty but also as a whole complex of measures for the protection of cultural values suggested by N. Roerich. Consequently, the Roerich Pact has not only legal but also philosophic, enlightening, and evolutional significance since it reflects an idea of cultural protection in its many manifestations.\n\nCharacterizing the Roerich Pact, cosmonaut A.A. Leonov wrote:\n\nIf we are raising a culture and spirituality then it will help us to strengthen an economics, to make the policy moral and to stop the military conflicts. This is a significance of the Roerich Pact today. The more time is passed the more actual for the world it becomes. …\n\nDeveloping the Pact ideas N. Roerich has stated the thoughts about a role of community. The laws for culture protection in itself will not work if the community will not display an activity and interest to this. Later this thought was supported by academician D.S. Likhachev. He said:\n\n… I believe that the best and freely developing social forms of culture can unite creative constructive forces and improve a social life, thereby help the state to maintain high ideals of humanism and peacefulness in the people. …\n\nAt the first international conference of Roerich Pact in Bruges (September, 1931), N. Roerich proposed to create a World League of Culture. One of main aims of the League must be to train care of the nature.\n\nIn his article \"Pain of the Planet\" (1933) N. Roerich wrote: \"The call about culture, call about the world, and call about creativity and beauty reaches the ear which is strengthen by true values only. Understanding of life as self-improving for the people's good arises where the respect of the nature is valid. Therefore, the League of Culture together with main enlightener activity must wholesale explain a wise regard for the nature as an origin of merry work, wise joy, continuous cognition and creativity\".\n\nThe cultural community highly appreciates N. Roerich's thought about the implementation of World Day of Culture. N. Roerich wrote:\n\"… We shall hear about the world Day of Culture too when at all schools and enlightener societies simultaneously the day will dedicated to comprehension of the national and world cultural treasures…\"\n\n"}

{"id": "667436", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=667436", "title": "Seabed Arms Control Treaty", "text": "Seabed Arms Control Treaty\n\nThe Seabed Arms Control Treaty (or Seabed Treaty, formally the Treaty on the Prohibition of the Emplacement of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction on the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor and in the Subsoil thereof) is a multilateral agreement between the United States, Soviet Union (now Russia), United Kingdom, and 91 other countries banning the emplacement of nuclear weapons or \"weapons of mass destruction\" on the ocean floor beyond a 12-mile (22.2 km) coastal zone. It allows signatories to observe all seabed \"activities\" of any other signatory beyond the 12-mile zone to ensure compliance.\n\nLike the Antarctic Treaty, the Outer Space Treaty, and the Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone treaties, the Seabed Arms Control Treaty sought to prevent the introduction of international conflict and nuclear weapons into an area hitherto free of them. Reaching agreement on the seabed, however, involved problems not met in framing the other two agreements.\n\nIn the 1960s, advances in the technology of oceanography and greatly increased interest in the vast and virtually untapped resources of the ocean floor led to concern that the absence of clearly established rules of law might lead to strife. And there were concurrent fears that nations might use the seabed as a new environment for military installations, including those capable of launching nuclear weapons.\n\nIn keeping with a proposal submitted to the U.N. Secretary General by Ambassador Pardo of Malta in August 1967, the U.N. General Assembly, on 18 December 1967, established an ad hoc committee to study ways of reserving the seabed for peaceful purposes, with the objective of ensuring \"that the exploration and use of the seabed and the ocean floor should be conducted in accordance with the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations, in the interests of maintaining international peace and security and for the benefit of all mankind.\" The Committee was given permanent status the following year. At the same time, seabed-related military and arms control issues were referred to the Eighteen Nation Committee on Disarmament (ENDC) and its successor, the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament (CCD). In a message of 18 March 1969, President Nixon said the American delegation to the ENDC should seek discussion of the factors necessary for an international agreement prohibiting the emplacement of weapons of mass destruction on the seabed and ocean floor and pointed out that an agreement of this kind would, like the Antarctic and Outer Space treaties, \"prevent an arms race before it has a chance to start.\"\n\nThe Seabed Arms Control Treaty was opened for signature in Washington, London, and Moscow on 11 February 1971. It entered into force 18 May 1972, when the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and more than 22 nations had deposited instruments of ratification. As of October 2018, 94 current states are parties to the treaty, while another 21 have signed the treaty but have not completed ratification.\n\nMultiple dates indicate the different days in which states submitted their signature or deposition, which varied by location. This location is noted by: (L) for London, (M) for Moscow, and (W) for Washington.\n\nThe Republic of China (Taiwan), which is currently only recognized by , deposited their instruments of ratification of the treaty prior to the United State's decision to switch their recognition of the sole legitimate government of China from the Republic of China (ROC) to the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1971. When the PRC subsequently ratified the treaty, they described the ROC's ratification as \"illegal\". The ROC has committed itself to continue to adhere to the requirements of the treaty, and the United States has declared that they still consider them to be \"bound by its obligations\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "35797415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35797415", "title": "South African labour law", "text": "South African labour law\n\nSouth African labour law regulates the relationship between employers, employees and trade unions in the Republic of South Africa.\n\nThe Native Labour Regulations Act 1911 prohibited strikes by trade unions, introduced wage ceilings and a pass system for moving around jobs. Over 70,000 Chinese labourers were brought in, and used by landowners to undercut the wages of other workers. Among white workers, there was significant unrest, and major strikes took place in 1907, 1913, 1914 and 1922\n\nFor a period of sixteen years, from 1979 to 1995, several critical developments occurred in the field of labour law in South Africa, beginning with a radical change in the first of these years, when a significant Commission of Enquiry was held, resulting in the establishment of an Industrial Court, which was given extensive powers to mould, change, shape and develop the law. Prior to 1995, most labour relations were based on contracts. In 1995, much of the law developed by the Commission and the Industrial Court was put together in the Labour Relations Act 1995 (LRA). Since then, most labour law has been based on statute.\n\nPrior to 1995, an employee could be dismissed in terms of the contract of employment, which could permit any reason for dismissal. Since 1995, an employee may be dismissed only for misconduct, operational reasons and incapacity. The Labour Relations Act 1995 is a pivotal piece of legislation, as it recognises the need for fast and easy access to justice in labour disputes. The Industrial Court had the status of a High Court, and therefore was not accessible to all labourers.\n\n1995 also saw the introduction of the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) which is an administrative tribunal. The Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration endeavours first and foremost to conciliate between the parties. If it is unsuccessful in this, the matter moves on to arbitration. The entire process is very informal, and at no charge, and is therefore very accessible to labourers, who often use it: About 300 new cases are brought before the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration daily. In addition to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration, 1995 saw the introduction of bargaining councils, which allow for communication across the industry. A bargaining council is organised collectively and voluntarily, and must be registered. In order to be registered, an alternative-dispute-resolution mechanism, similar to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration, must be put in place.\n\nThe Labour Relations Act 1995 also regulated the issue of fairness, not only in termination but during employment, too. In 1998, however, most of the law on unfair labour practices was removed from the Labour Relations Act 1995 and put into the Employment Equity Act (EEA). The EEA also deals with issues such as fairness regarding a worker's human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status or disability, as well as the issue of affirmative action.\n\nThe Basic Conditions of Employment Act (BCEA), the Health and Safety Acts and the Skills Development Act, must be read with the EEA. The Skills Development Act provides that a small percentage of a labourer's salary must be contributed to the Department of Labour, enabling certain workshops to be run which are designed to develop skills.\n\nChapter 2 of the Constitution contains several provisions of relevance to employment and labour law:\n\n\nIt is important to interpret all labour legislation in light of the Constitution.\n\nSection 23 of the Constitution deals specifically with labour relations, providing that everyone has the right to fair labour practices, and specifically the right\n\n\nEvery employer, meanwhile, has the right\n\n\nEvery trade union and every employers’ organisation has the right\n\n\nFinally, every trade union, employers’ organisation and employer has the right to engage in collective bargaining.\n\nSection 23(1) is an unusual provision—only South Africa and Malawi expressly protect the right to fair labour practices — as it is so broad and overarching. An exact definition of fair labour practices is impossible, since this is a dynamic field of the law, rooted in socioeconomic rights. Section 23(1) refers to \"everyone,\" encompassing far more than merely employees and workers; it also includes would-be workers, employers and juristic persons.\n\nSection 23 is not entirely universal, however, as soldiers are excluded from its ambit insofar as they may not strike at a time of war.\n\nThe Labour Relations Act was promulgated as the \"national legislation\" referred to in subsections 23(5) and 23(6), which provide respectively that \"national legislation may be enacted to regulate collective bargaining,\" and that \"national legislation may recognise union security arrangements contained in collective agreements.\" Both subsections stipulate that, to the extent that such legislation may limit one of the rights in section 23, the limitation must comply with section 36(1), the limitations clause of the Constitution.\n\nThe current Basic Conditions of Employment Act is also designed to give effect to the right to fair labour practices. Both Acts are bolstered by the EEA, which replicates the equality clause in the Constitution in its totality, adding that one may not discriminate on the basis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status.\n\nThe general guarantee of fair labour practices has far-reaching effects on the civil courts’ approach to the interpretation of the rights of parties to employment contracts.\n\nAll courts are enjoined, when applying and developing the common law, to have due regard to the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights. This calls for a reconsideration of some of the assumptions underlying the common-law contract of employment, in particular the employer’s power of command and unfettered rights in respect of promotion and dismissal.\n\nFurthermore, the labour courts’ judgments on such contentious issues as the dismissal of striking workers are subject to review by the Constitutional Court, so long as the applicants have exhausted the procedures available to them under the labour legislation.\n\nIn \"NUMSA v Bader Bop\", the Constitutional Court overturned a decision of the Labour Appeal Court which restrictively interpreted the Labour Relations Act 1995. The court recognised the necessity of collective bargaining and bargaining councils which facilitate the establishment of trade unions. The court held that minority unions may not strike in support of demands for organisational rights reserved in the Act for majority unions.\n\nIn \"NEHAWU v University of Cape Town\", the Constitutional Court overturned another decision of the Labour Appeal Court which restrictively interpreted the Labour Relations Act 1995. It had been argued that the term \"everyone\" did not include a university or a company, but the court held otherwise. Furthermore, the court ruled that, under the original section 197 of the Labour Relations Act 1995, contracts of employment transferred automatically when businesses were transferred, irrespective of the wishes of the employers.\n\n\"SANDU v Minister of Defence\", another Constitutional Court, case Judge O’Reagan dealt with the concept of a \"worker,\" and held that, although the Labour Relations Act 1995 does not apply to South African National Defense Force (SANDF) members, they are still \"workers\" in terms of the Constitution, which protects the rights of every person in South Africa.\n\nThe first question to be asked, when seeking to resolve any labour law problem, is whether the parties are indeed \"employees\" and \"employers\" within the meaning of the applicable statute or the common law.\n\nThis has long been a difficult task in South Africa, as it is not always immediately apparent whether the parties have entered into the \"locatio conductio operarum\" (contract of employment) or merely the \"locatio conductio operis\" (contract of work).\n\nDistinguishing between these two kinds of contracts is critically important, as different legal consequences flow from the various forms of contract. Most important is that South African labour legislation applies only in respect of employees, who are entitled to social security benefits and have access to the statutory mechanisms if they wish to seek remedies for violations of their employment rights. Similarly, only employers are bound by the labour statutes, and are vicariously liable for the delicts of their employees.\n\nThe first source to be examined, when seeking to determine whether parties to a work relationship are employers and employees, is the contract into which they have entered.\n\nA contract of employment comes into existence when the parties conclude an agreement that conforms to the requirements of the \"locatio conductio operarum\". The contract of employment is traditionally defined as \"a contract between two persons, the master (employer) and the servant (employee), for the letting and hiring of the latter's services for reward, the master being able to supervise and control the servant’s work.\"\n\nThis, however, begs the question of how much supervision or control is required to distinguish between employees and independent contractors.\n\nReported judgments have indicated that the task of distinguishing employees and employers from parties to other contractual relationships entailing the provision of work, or the rendering of services, is not a matter of definition; classification of such contracts is a \"matter of substance, not merely of form.\"\n\nThe true nature of the contract, therefore, is determined from the relationship between the parties, not merely the label the parties have given their contract.\n\nStatutory definitions do not resolve the problem. \"Employee\" is defined\n\n\nThe difference between the Labour Relations Act 1995 and the EEA is that the Labour Relations Act 1995 excludes independent contractors only in section 213(a), while the EEA excludes independent contractors in both subsections. It is safe, however, to assume that even from the second part of the definition of an \"employee,\" as it appears in the Labour Relations Act 1995 or the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, independent contractors are implicitly excluded.\n\nAt the core of subsection (a) of both definitions lies a reference to the contract of employment: one person working for another in exchange for some form of remuneration.\n\nThe basic idea behind subsection (b) of both definitions is that employees are those people who place their capacity to work at the disposal of others. This is the essence of employment.\n\nThe case of \"Liberty Life Association of Africa v Niselow\" reiterates the law set out above and the interpretation of the definition of \"employee.\"\n\nLabour legislation does not define \"contract of service\" or the concept of \"work\" at all.\n\nThis means that it is necessary to look outside the legislation to determine the meaning of these terms, in order to distinguish between an employee and an independent contractor.\n\nThe courts have formulated a number of tests for drawing the distinction.\n\nThe control test focuses on the element of \"control\" exercised by the employer over the employee.\n\nThe power to control has traditionally been regarded as the hallmark of the employment contract. With the advent of highly skilled employees who are given free rein in performing their duties, the courts no longer insist on \"de facto\" control, as once they did, but recognise that a \"right\" to control is sufficient.\n\nThe courts initially applied the requirement of a right to control rather strictly, as in \"R v AMCA Services\", where the presiding officer spoke of \"a right to control, not only the end to be achieved by the other’s labour and the general lines to be followed, but the detailed manner in which the work is to be performed.\"\n\nIt is now clear, however, that the courts have in mind, a right to control only in principle. The employer not choosing to exercise that right does not render the contract something other than one of employment.\n\nThe application of the control test in isolation is entirely inadequate, as certain employees have a wide discretion as to how to perform their work. Such discretion does not alone render them independent contractors.\n\nThe ultimate difference between an employee and an independent contractor is that the principal has no legal right to prescribe the manner in which the independent contractor brings about the desired result, but may prescribe methods by which the employee works. In \"Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society v MacDonald\", the court held that the employee was subject to the control of the employer in the sense that the latter had the right to prescribe not only what work had to be done, but also the manner in which that work had to be done. The independent contractor, on the other hand, could be directed only as to what work must be done, not \"how\" it was to be done.\n\nIn any event, to define a contract in terms of one of its characteristics is tautological.\n\nThe organisation test was developed in French law and adopted by South African law in \"R v AMCA Services and Another\". It is based upon the assumption that whether or not one is an employee does not rest on submission to orders; it depends on whether the person is part and parcel of the organisation.\n\nIn other words, one looks at the extent to which a person (the worker) is integrated into the organisation of the other person (the employer), or whether the person is performing work inside the organisation of another.\n\nThe work of an independent contractor, although done for the business, is not integrated into it; it is only accessory to it.\n\nIf a person is incorporated into or related sufficiently to the organisation, that person will be regarded as an employee or a worker even though the employer might exercise little actual control over him.\n\nOne of the problems with this test is that it is not always possible to measure the extent of integration, or to determine what degree of integration is sufficient for someone to qualify as an employee.\n\nThe test was rejected by the Appellate Division in \"S v AMCA Services\" on the basis of it being too vague.\n\nThe deficiencies of the control and organisation tests led the courts to approach the question in the same way that they approach so many other problems: The relationship is viewed as a whole; a conclusion is drawn from the entire picture.\n\nIn \"Ongevallekommissaris v Onderlinge Versekeringsgenootskap AV-BOB\", although the court did not spell out exactly what may be included in the general picture, guidance may be derived from the English case of \"Ready Mixed Concrete v Minister of Pensions and National Insurance\", in which the presiding officer set out three possible components:\n\n\nWhen courts examine the \"other provisions of the contract,\" they will consider all relevant aspects of the relationship. These include:\n\n\nThe decisive difference between the control test and the dominant-impression test is that, in the latter, the existence or absence of control is only one of the factors to be taken into account.\n\nIn \"Smit v Workmen's Compensation Commissioner\", the court had to decide whether Smit, who had been employed as an \"agent\" for an insurance company, was an employee or not. He had been\n\n\nThe dominant-impression test was followed in this case, and Smit was held to not be an employee of the insurance company.\n\nIn \"Medical Association of SA v Minister of Health\", several district surgeons challenged the decision of the provincial MEC for Health for the Free State to terminate their contracts summarily as part of the restructuring of the district health service. The multiple or dominant impression test was followed, and the court used the factors discussed in \"Smit\" to assist it in obtaining the dominant impression that part-time district surgeons were in fact employees of the State.\n\nThe court held that the dominant-impression tests entails that one should have regard to all those considerations or \"indica\" which would contribute towards a determination of whether the contract is one of service or of work, and react to the impression one gets upon a consideration of all such \"indica\". The Labour Court based its decision on the following factors:\n\n\nThe test has been subjected to severe criticism. Etienne Mureinik has said that it test\n\noffers no guidance in answering the (legal) question whether the facts are of such a nature that the individual may be held to be servant within the meaning of the common law in difficult (penumbral) cases. Indeed, it is no test at all. To say that an employment contract is a contract which looks like one of employment sheds no light whatsoever on the legal nature of the relationship.\n\nThis criticism is based on the idea that it is not helpful to say a particular relationship exists because it looks like it does.\n\nIn other decisions, the courts appear to have resorted to what may be described as the \"productive capacity\" test.\n\nThis test was formulated in Martin Brassey’s article \"The Nature of Employment\" in the following terms:\n\nThe independent contractor “sells the job” whereas the employee “sells his hands” [... E]mployment is a relationship in which one person is obliged, by contract or otherwise, to place his or her capacity to work at the disposal of another [... A]n employee is to be distinguished from an independent contractor, who undertakes to deliver, not his or her capacity to produce, but the product of that capacity, the completed work.\n\nIn \"SA Broadcasting Corporation v McKenzie\", the Labour Appeal Court summarised the main differences between the contract of employment proper and what is called the \"contract of work\" (\"locatio conductio operis\"):\n\n\nThere is very little work that cannot be outsourced. Outsourcing is generally not supported by trade unions, who represent employees. If work is outsourced, the worker is an independent contractor. Political pressure was placed on government to move away from outsourcing and more towards employment.\n\nIn 2002, accordingly, a new presumption was added to the Labour Relations Act 1995, providing guidelines on when it has to be ascertained whether or not someone is an employee. This presumption was introduced as a part of significant amendments to the Labour Relations Act 1995 and the Basic Conditions of Employment Act in 2002.\n\nThe effect of this rebuttable presumption is that, if one or more of the list of factors is present, the person is presumed to be an employee unless and until the contrary is proven. Many of the factors and issues discussed by the courts in the cases above resurface again: The presumption is thus created\n\n\nThe legislative provision has been taken by some to be merely a restatement or summary of the principles laid down by the courts with the passing of time.\n\nAlthough this presumption is useful in determining whether a person is an employee or not, as it is closely linked to the principles and approaches developed by the courts, the Labour Court held, in \"Catlin v CCMA\", that section 200A does not do away with the principle that the true nature of the relationship between the parties must be gathered from the contract between them. Section 200A is not the starting point, therefore; the court held that it is necessary to consider the provisions of the contract before applying the presumptions.\n\nThe common-law concept of employment sets the scene for the interpretation of the Labour Relations Act 1995.\n\nThe contract of employment is the foundation of the relationship between an employee and his employer. It links the two parties in an employment relationship, irrespective of the form the contract takes.\n\nThe existence of an employment relationship is the starting point for the application of all labour law rules. Without an employment relationship between the parties, the rules of labour law do not apply.\n\nThe origin of South Africa's modern contract of employment lie in Roman law, where a distinction was made between the two types of contracts discussed above: \"locatio conductio operis\" and \"locatio conductio operarum\".\n\nIn terms of the common law, one does not have to have a written contract; therefore, not having the contract in written form is not a fatal flaw, as the contract can be verbal. There are, however, a number of statutes which require specific contracts of employment to be in writing. Section 29 of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, for example, states that the employer must supply the employee with certain written particulars concerning specific things, like hours worked and remuneration.\n\nLike any contract, the \"locatio conductio operarum\" commences when the parties have agreed to its essential terms, unless both parties have agreed to suspend its operation for a particular period. If the contract's operation is suspended, the employer is obliged to allow the employee to commence work on the specified date. Failure to do so, without good cause, constitutes a breach of contract at common law and a dismissal under the Labour Relations Act 1995. It is important, therefore, to determine what the essentials of the contract of employment are.\n\nStripped to its essence, the contract of employment today may be defined as an agreement between two parties, in terms of which one party (the employee) works for another (the employer) in exchange for remuneration. Although this definition appears to be simple, it contains a number of important principles, aspects and implications. When they are taken into account below, the definition of the employment contract may be expanded as follows:\n\nThe contract of employment is a voluntary agreement between two legal personae (the parties) in terms of which one party (the employee) places his or her personal services or labour potential at the disposal of the other party (the employer) for an indefinite or determined period in exchange for some form of fixed or ascertainable remuneration, which may include money and/or payments in kind. This entitles the employer to define the employee’s duties and to control the manner in which the employee discharges them.\n\nFirstly, it must be noted that the employment contract is based on agreement; the parties must enter into it voluntarily. This idea finds expression in section 13 of the Constitution, which provides that \"no one may be subjected to slavery, servitude or forced labour,\" and section 48 of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, which states that \"all forced labour is prohibited.\"\n\nAnother implication of the fact that the employment contract is based on agreement is that it is a contract, and therefore must comply with the requirements of our law for a valid contract. If it does not comply with these requirements, it will not be regarded as binding and enforceable.\n\nConsensus between the parties means that both must have a serious intention to create mutual rights and duties to which they will be legally bound. They must have each been fully aware of the nature of the duties, and that the other had this intention.\n\nAt common law, the parties are not required to observe any formalities. There is no requirement that the contract be in writing, but certain employment contracts are required by statute to be in writing, like those of merchant seamen and learners under the Skills Development Act. In addition, those of apprentices and candidate attorneys must also be registered with the appropriate authorities. Lastly, where parties wish to alter provisions of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, this must be done in writing.\n\nSecondly, one of the pivotal concepts in the initial definition is that of work. Generally, to work means to place one’s labour potential at the disposal and under the control of another. This means that, when we work, we offer our services to another person, and agree that the other person will be able to tell us what to do, when to do it, how to do it and where to do it.\n\nTo place your labour potential at the disposal of another means to offer your ability to perform certain tasks to another person, and to offer, at the same time to follow that person’s instructions.\n\nRemuneration normally takes the form of payment of money, or the provision of another benefit. (According to the common law, payment may be made in kind.)\n\nPayment may be made monthly, weekly, daily or even in irregular cash payments. The common law does not prescribe what form payment must take.\n\nThe Labour Relations Act 1995 contains a statutory definition of remuneration in section 213: \"any payment in money or in kind, or both in money and in kind, made or owing to any person in return for that person working for any other person, including the State.\"\n\nThe contract may state that remuneration is the \"normal going rate for a specific type of work,\" or state a specific amount or merely \"minimum wage.\"\n\nThe common law does not indicate minimum wages; these are usually set by collective-bargaining councils and are industry specific.\n\nThe contract of employment is a reciprocal contract. This means that one promise is made in exchange for another, and one obligation is incurred in exchange for the other. The employee works in exchange for remuneration; the employer remunerates the employee in exchange for the employee offering to place his labour potential at the disposal and under the control of the employer.\n\nTo summarise, the essential elements of the employment contract are as follows:\n\n\nAn employment relationship commences only when the parties conclude a contract of service. Prior to this, neither party has any rights against the other; they are merely a prospective employee and a prospective employer.\n\nThere are, however, two statutory exceptions to the principle that employers have no obligations to applicants for employment:\n\n\nIn addition to the three principle duties of the employer, discussed below, employers are further obliged to accord employees their rights in terms of the applicable contracts of service, collective agreements and legislation, as well as to adhere to certain statutory duties imposed in the interests of employees.\n\nThe employer’s obligation to receive the employee into service is the corollary of the employee’s duty to enter and remain in service.\n\nThe duty to receive employees into service does not mean that employers must necessarily provide employees with work to keep them busy, although this general rule is subject to some exceptions: where, for example, remuneration is based on the volume of work done, as in the case of piece-workers or salespersons working on commission, or where the failure to allow the employee to work degrades his status. A duty to provide work may also arise where the employer has contracted to train the employee in a particular profession or trade, as in the case of article clerks and apprentices.\n\nThe common law permits the suspension of an employee, suspected of some form of grave misconduct, while the matter is being investigated, but the employee is entitled to his remuneration during the period of suspension.\n\nEmployers may deny their employees access to the workplace, or otherwise prevent them from working, in the course of collective bargaining. This is known as a \"lock out,\" and is the employer’s equivalent of the employees’ strike. If a lock out is lawful—if, that is, it complies with the Labour Relations Act 1995—the employer is relieved of its obligation to pay the locked-out employees their wages.\n\nSince the contract of employment is personal, one employer cannot compel an employee to work for another if the first employer has no work for him, unless the first employer's business is transferred as a going concern.\n\nThis duty is so fundamental to the employment contract that the courts will assume, where there has been no agreement on remuneration, either that the contract is not a contract of employment, or else that the parties impliedly intended the payment of a reasonable sum according to the custom and practice of the industry and locality.\n\nThe duty to pay, and the commensurate right to remuneration, arises not from the actual performance of work, but from the tendering of service.\n\nIt has become a widespread practice for employers to make up remuneration \"packages\" for their higher-paid employees in a tax-effective way, by substituting various benefits (like housing and car allowances) for the cash component of the salary.\n\nThe periodicity of payment depends on the parties’ agreement or on custom.\n\nAn employer may not unilaterally deduct any amount from the remuneration to which an employee is entitled.\n\nIf the contract is terminated summarily for good cause, the employer must pay the employee for services rendered to the day of the dismissal. The same principle applies when the employee deserts mid-term before the end of a fixed-term contract or without proper notice.\n\nUnder the common law, employers are obliged to provide their employees with reasonably safe and healthy working conditions.\n\nThe scope of this duty extends to providing proper machinery and equipment, properly trained and competent supervisory staff, and a safe system of working.\n\nIf the employer fails to meet with this obligation, affected employees are not in breach of contract if they refuse to work until the dangerous situation is corrected.\n\nUnder the common law, employees had to rely on delict if the employer did not ensure that the working conditions were safe and healthy, but this was viewed to be imprecise, and the Legislature intervened. The situation is now governed by the Occupational Health and Safety Act, which implements strict liability on the employer, and states how much must be paid to the employee if accidents occur.\n\nIf the breach is material, the employee may claim damages. Provided it is a material breach, the employee may also cancel the contract of employment.\n\nThe employee may also claim specific performance. This was seldom granted in the past but is now considered an option.\n\nFinally, the employee may refuse to work, withholding labour until the contract is performed.\n\nThe main obligation of the employee under the contract is to place his personal services at the disposal of his employer.\n\nThe tender of service is a prerequisite to and the corollary of the employee’s right to claim payment of wages: \"no work, no pay.\" The reverse also applies: \"no pay, no work,\" so that employees who have not been paid may legitimately refuse to work without breaching their contracts.\n\nIf a number of workers engage in a concerted cessation of work for the purpose of obtaining some concession from their employer, they are deemed to be on strike. Under the common law, striking workers need not be paid. The common law also allowed employers summarily to dismiss striking employees, but this has since been changed by the Labour Relations Act 1995.\n\nSubject to the right to take such paid leave as has been agreed upon or conferred by statute, once employees have entered service, they remain obliged to render service until the contract of employment ends.\n\nIf the employee fails to render service (by desertion, absenteeism, abscondment, unpunctuality, etc.), the employer is entitled to deduct from the employee’s wage an amount proportional to the absence.\n\nEmployees are deemed by law to guarantee impliedly that they are capable of performing the tasks they agree to perform, and that they will carry them out with reasonable efficiency.\n\nWhere an employer seeks assurances about employees’ competence before taking them into service, the employees are bound by any representations they may make, whether those professions of competence are made by the employees themselves, or in testimonials of which they are aware.\n\nThe standard of competence employers are entitled to expect of their employees depends on the capacities in which the employees are engaged and the status and seniority accorded them.\n\nThe test for the standard of competence is that of persons comparable with the employees in question, having regard to training, experience and any special claims the employee might have made regarding his competence.\n\nWhere an employee has warranted that he possesses a particular degree of skill, he must satisfy that representation.\n\nEmployees are obliged to devote their energies and skills to furthering their employer’s business interests. They must devote all their normal working hours to the employer’s business; they may not, without the employer’s permission, simultaneously work for another employer during the hours they are contractually obliged to devote to their employer’s needs.\n\nThese duties arise because the relationship between the parties is of a fiduciary nature: Employees may not place themselves in positions where their own interests conflict with those of their employers and may not, by exercising their powers of agency, acquire interests or benefits without the knowledge of their employers.\n\nThe interests of Employees must be \"bona fide\": They may not work for another employer if its business interests are in conflict with those of the principle employer.\n\nIn the absence of a contrary provision in the contract, there is nothing to preclude employees from holding two compatible jobs, provided the second is not conducted during the working hours they are obliged to devote to the first job. Contractual provisions limiting employees’ moonlighting activities are, however, permissible.\n\nIn addition, employees may not compete with their employer’s business for their own account.\n\nRespect and obedience are regarded as an implied duty of every employee. Absence of the former renders the interpersonal relationship between employer and employee intolerable; denial of the latter undermines the employer’s right to decide how its employees will work.\n\nThe courts require all employees to show a reasonable degree of respect and courtesy to their employers, and to obey their employers’ reasonable and lawful instructions.\n\nRespect, being a disposition, is a quality that is difficult to define with precision. It is not to be equated with deference in a manner compatible with the subordinate position in which the employee by definition stands \"vis-à-vis\" the employer.\n\nMere failure on occasion to greet the employer or superiors will not place employees in breach of their obligation to show respect. Disrespect must be gross if it is to justify termination of the employment relationship, or so frequent as to suggest that the employee has repudiated the employer's lawful authority, or that it has rendered the continuation of the employment relationship \"intolerable.\"\n\nEach case must be considered on its own merits to establish whether these inferences may be drawn.\n\nUnless insolence is particularly gross, the proper sanction is a written warning in the first instance.\n\nThe employee’s duty of obedience applies only to work-related orders and generally during working hours and to those orders which are lawful and reasonable.\n\nEmployees are also entitled to disobey instructions that would subject them to personal dangers not normally connected with the performance of their duties.\n\nAn order is unlawful if it requires the employee to perform an illegal act or to do something that falls outside the scope of the contractual relationship.\n\nAny misconduct that renders the continuation of the employment relationship intolerable or unworkable, or undermines trust and confidence between employer and employee, is regarded as sufficient to justify dismissal, provided it is serious enough to offset the importance which the courts otherwise attach to the work security of employees. Examples of misconduct are insubordination, theft, fraud.\n\nWith regard to misconduct committed before the formation of the conduct (like the commission of a serious crime), the general principle is that there is no duty on prospective employees to disclose prejudicial information from their past to their future employers unless they are specifically asked to do so.\n\nA duty may arise, however, where the non-disclosure is material and amounts to fraud. Whether or not an employee may be dismissed for non-disclosure depends on whether or not the employment relationship can reasonably be sustained after the discovery of the past misdeed.\n\nThe employer may only dismiss the employee summarily for misconduct, incapacity or operational requirements. If damages are incurred as a result of a breach of one of these duties, the employer may claim compensation.\n\nThe Basic Conditions of Employment Act is aimed at low-income earners: those who earn less than R193,805 \"per annum\".\n\nNo matter what the contract itself says, the Basic Conditions of Employment Act is applicable as the minimum standard that must be achieved.\n\nThe Labour Relations Act 1995 deals with strikes and unions and the like; the Basic Conditions of Employment Act is a fall back option for those vulnerable workers who are not able to unionize due to various reasons, such as the kind of work they do. Domestic and farm workers are pertinent examples in the South African context.\n\nThe purpose of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act is to advance economic development by providing basic conditions of employment.\n\nThe Basic Conditions of Employment Act also contains the definition of an employee, so that issue, discussed above, is relevant here, too. The Minister is empowered to extend the provisions of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act to non-employees in specific circumstances. Even, therefore, if a domestic worker is not considered an employee in terms of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, the Minister may extend the provisions to her for her own protection.\n\nThe employer has no discretion to pay less than the minimum wage. As noted above, the Basic Conditions of Employment Act provides the minimum standard to be achieved; employers must, at the very least, abide by the Basic Conditions of Employment Act.\n\nMinimum wages are the result of bargaining councils in most circumstances, but some professions have no bargaining councils. Their minimum wage is therefore regulated by the Basic Conditions of Employment Act.\n\nA maximum of 45 hours per week is allowed to be worked. These stipulations (regarding hours) are not applicable on the following persons:\n\nOvertime is permitted on the basis of a voluntary agreement.\n\nPayment for overtime is 1½ times the normal wage.\n\nPayment for working on a Sunday is twice the normal wage if the employee is not expected in terms of his/her contract to work on Sundays, however if the employee is expected to work on Sundays in terms of his or her contract, the employee shall receive 1.5 times the normal wage.\n\nA worker is entitled to double pay only if it is stipulated in the employee's contract that he/ she is expected to work on public holidays.\n\nAn employee is entitled to one hour off for every 5 hours of work.\n\nAn employee is entitled to 36 consecutive hours off. Issues such as night work, holidays and public holidays are also covered.\n\nAn employee is entitled to 6 weeks off over a three-year period, it is often interpreted as one day for 26 days of work.\n\nAn employee is entitled to four months off in total, the leave must start at least 4 weeks prior to the expected birth date, and end at least 6 weeks after the expected date of birth. It does not, however, stipulate that this is paid leave. In terms of the Unemployment Insurance Fund, when a woman is on maternity leave, she is entitled to Unemployment Insurance Fund benefits for half the time spent away. Usually the employer will pay the other half, but this is not required in the Basic Conditions of Employment Act.\n\nIf the employee has been working for more than four months, he is entitled to 3 days family-responsibility leave, as in the case where there has been a death in his family.\n\nEmployers must keep records of the hours worked and remuneration awarded for each employee for at least three years.\n\nEmployees are to be paid in South African currency at the place of work (unless this is altered in the contract).\n\nEmployers may not deduct money from employees unless prior consent in writing is obtained.\n\nRegarding severance pay, in cases of retrenchments or dismissals for operational reasons, employees are entitled to one week’s pay for every year worked.\n\nThe Basic Conditions of Employment Act is the very minimum standard required by employers. Employers may award more, but never less, than what is stipulated.\n\nIf an employer gives more than the minimum, he may be locked into always giving more, as he must then abide by the required annual increases, which are based on a percentage of the current pay.\n\nAn employer may vary the provisions in the contract by\n\n\nIn the past, the concept of \"unfair labour practice\" was broadly defined. The Industrial Court (a specialist tribunal that exercised jurisdiction over alleged unfair labour practices) took several innovative approaches. The court formulated a set of rules to govern unfair dismissals. These rules are now contained in Chapter VIII of the Labour Relations Act 1995 and in the Code of Good Practice: Dismissal.\n\nThe employment relationship has three stages:\n\n\nUnfair conduct by the employer at the beginning of the relationship normally takes the form of unfair discrimination. Unfair conduct by the employer at the end of the relationship normally takes the form of unfair dismissal. Unfair conduct by the employer during the subsistence of the relationship will take the form of unfair labour practice.\n\nSection 186(2) of the Labour Relations Act 1995 defines an \"unfair labour practice\" as \"an unfair act or omission that arises between an employer and an employee,\" and involves\n\n\nThe first part of section 186(2) speaks of an unfair labour practice as any unfair act or omission that arises between an employer and an employee. Only persons who are already in employment, therefore, enjoy protection against unfair labour practices; only persons, that is, who fall within the definition of \"employee.\"\n\nThis concept may also cover ex-employees, if an employer refuses or fails to re-employ a former employee in terms of an agreement, for example.\n\nDue to the use of the word \"involving,\" the courts have held that the list of unfair labour practices, contained in section 186(2), is exhaustive. Therefore the definition of \"unfair labour practice\" in the current Labour Relations Act is considerably narrower than that of its predecessor, the Labour relations Act of 1956. This is because concepts such as unfair discrimination have been removed from its ambit and included in the EEA.\n\nThe fact that the list is exhaustive raises three issues, as the Constitution expressly affords everyone the right to fair labour practices:\n\n\nWith regard to the interpretation of this definition, the general principle is that legislation that limits constitutional rights must be interpreted in such a way as to minimise the limitation. The definition must be interpreted so as to give the maximum possible protection.\n\nWith regard to the freedom to rely directly on the Constitution, employees may rely directly on the Constitution to challenge practices not covered by the Labour Relations Act 1995, like transfers. This issue, however, remains to be developed by the courts.\n\nMany cases have been referred to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration and the courts in this regard. From these cases, three main issues arise:\n\n\nEmployers commonly use one of two systems to promote employees:\n\n\nThe second system is problematic. The Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration and the courts have held that it is not promotion at all, as the employee is nothing other than a job applicant.\n\nFirstly, in order to constitute a dispute concerning promotion or demotion, the aggrieved individual must be an employee of the employer to which he wishes to take action.\n\nSecondly, one must compare the current job held by the employee with the job applied for.\n\nFactors which are taken into account include any difference in remuneration levels, fringe benefits, status, levels of responsibility or authority or power, and the level of job security.\n\nIn \"Mashegoane v University of the North\", the dispute was whether the university’s refusal to appoint a lecturer to the position of Dean of a faculty involved a promotion. The legislation governing the university provided that Deans were appointed by the Senate acting on the recommendation of the Faculty Board. The university argued\n\n\nOnce the court established that the applicant was a current employee, it found that his salary would have remained the same, but that he would have received a Dean's allowance and would have had a car at his disposal; these were the only benefits. His status would have been considerably elevated. He would have had more responsibilities, authority and powers. In light of this, the appointment amounted to a promotion.\n\nIn \"Nawa v Department of Trade and Industry\", however, the court held that there was no promotion because there was no intention to change the existing terms and conditions of employment, even though there was an intention to change the way in which work was done.\n\nGenerally the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration and other institutions are quick to assume that there was indeed a promotion or demotion.\n\nDisputes concerning Promotion and Demotion generally involve employees being denied a higher-level post within the structure of the employer's organization or being stripped of status or benefits.\n\nGenerally, unfairness implies a failure to meet an objective standard, and includes arbitrary, capricious or inconsistent conduct, regardless of whether it is intentional or negligent.\n\nMere unhappiness on the part of the employee is not unfair.\n\nWith regard to substantive fairness, it may be difficult to justify the choice of a particular candidate in precise terms. An employer is at liberty to take into account subjective factors, such as performance at an interview, when considering an appointment or promotion. The employer must still provide reasons, however.\n\nWith regard to procedural fairness, the employer must follow its own procedures: If there is a practice of advertising the posts, it may not, without good reason, depart from that policy. An employee may challenge the composition and competency of a selection panel.\n\nExamples of unfairness include bias, nepotism and erroneous exclusion of an employee from a shortlist due to a mistake by the employer or selection committee.\n\nThe relief must be determined on terms deemed reasonable by the Commissioner.\n\nRelief may be in the form of a declaratory order, protective promotion, remitting the matter back to the employer for reconsideration, and reinstatement to a previous position (in the case of demotion).\n\nGuidelines may be gathered from the rules which govern the obligations of the employer before a fair decision to dismiss on the grounds of poor performance is reached, and also from the Code of Good Practice: Dismissals.\n\nIn this context, unfair conduct may include the failure to inform the employee properly about required performance standards, and the failure by an employer to afford the employee reasonable guidance, evaluation, training, counselling and instruction.\n\nAn employer may commit an unfair labour practice through unfair conduct relating to the provision of benefits.\n\nThis provision, contained in section 186(2)(a) of the Labour Relations Act 1995, does not appear to be problematic, but it has been beset by considerable uncertainties regarding the interpretation of \"benefits.\"\n\nEarly decisions of the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration attached a wide meaning to the term \"benefits.\"\n\nThe problem is complicated by section 65(1)(c) of the Labour Relations Act 1995, which provides that employees may not strike over issues that may be referred to arbitration in terms of the Labour Relations Act 1995. A dispute over \"benefits\" may be referred to arbitration. If \"benefits\" is given a wide meaning, and is taken to include remuneration, this would mean that employees may not strike over wages and salaries.\n\nThere are two approaches to resolving the problem of interpretation:\n\n\nGenerally the courts take a narrow approach to interpretation. They apply a combination of the two approaches above. It has been held that the term \"benefits\" in the definition of an unfair labour practice includes only benefits \"ex contractu\" and \"ex lege\": benefits that already exist in terms of a contract or law.\n\nThere is growing support for the notion that unfair labour practices should include not only disputes of right, but also disputes where there is an expectation of a right.\n\nThis prohibition has had little effect in practice. In view, however, of the obligations placed on employers in terms of the EEA and Skills Development Act, it may become more important in the future.\n\nGenerally employees may challenge the denial of training where such training is a prerequisite for advancement in the workplace.\n\nThere are two types of suspension:\n\n\nIn the context of section 186(2)(b), one must consider whether both types of suspension are covered, and what the requirements for a fair suspension are.\n\nInitially the view was taken that only punitive suspensions fell within the scope of the \"unfair labour practice,\" but this view was rejected by the Labour Court.\n\nThe Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration follows the Labour Court's view and assumes jurisdiction over both punitive and preventative suspensions.\n\nThe practice of preventative suspension is not in itself unfair so long as there is substantive and procedural fairness when the employer takes this decision.\n\nSubstantive fairness in this context refers to the reason for the suspension. The employer must have a reason for believing that the suspension is necessary. This could be, for example, where the seriousness of the misconduct creates rumours and suspicion, necessitating a suspension of the employee in order for work to carry on smoothly, or where the employer has reason to fear that the employee in question may interfere with the investigation or the witnesses. It may also be that the employer fears another recurrence of the misconduct, or that the seniority and authority of the employee in question has a bearing on the matter.\n\nProcedural fairness does not necessarily mean that the employee must be given a hearing before the suspension. At least, though, that the employer must inform him of the suspension, the reasons for it, and the conditions of the suspension.\n\nAs a general rule, the employer must continue remunerating the employee during the course of the suspension. If he were to cease remuneration, this would constitute a breach of contract.\n\nSuspension without pay is generally only possible if the employee consents, or if this is provided by legislation or the contract of employment itself.\n\nIf the suspension is grossly unfair, the employee may seek reinstatement as a remedy.\n\nWhere the unfairness is less serious, the employee may seek an alteration of the conditions of the suspension or require that the employer hold a disciplinary hearing within a specified time.\n\nOther disciplinary actions, like warnings, suspensions with or without pay, demotions and transfers, must also meet the requirement of fairness. The employer must be able to show that the warning, demotion or other disciplinary action was fair and appropriate in the circumstances.\n\nSection 186(2)(c) of the Labour Relations Act 1995 protects employees against a \"failure or refusal of an employer to reinstate or re-employ a former employee in terms of any agreement.\"\n\nThe wording is almost exactly the same as that in section 186(d), which deals with dismissal. Unlike section 186(2)(d), however, section 186(2)(c) does not deal with termination of employment; nor does it state that there must be an offer of re-employment to some employees and no offer in respect of others. Furthermore, section 186(2)(d) does not refer to an agreement; section 186(2)(c) does.\n\nAny occupational detriment an employee may suffer due to the making of a protected disclosure is an unfair labour practice.\n\n\"Occupational detriment\" and \"protected disclosure\" are defined in the Protected Disclosures Act.\n\n\"Occupational detriment\" includes, \"inter alia\", being subjected to disciplinary action; dismissed, suspended, demoted, harassed or intimidated; transferred against one's will, refused transfer or promotion, etc.\n\nOnce it is established that the employee has suffered an \"occupational detriment,\" it must be proved that the detriment was due to a protected disclosure. This means that there must be a protected disclosure, and that there must be causality between the disclosure and the detriment.\n\nAs far as causality is concerned, the Labour Relations Act 1995 requires that the detriment must be \"on account of\" the protected disclosure.\n\n\"Disclosure\" is defined as \"any disclosure of information regarding any conduct of an employer, or an employee of that employer, made by any employee who has reason to believe that the information concerned shows or tends to show one or more of the following:\n\n\nGenerally, such disclosures become protected when they are made to certain persons and offices under certain conditions:\n\n\nFurthermore, the employee must have reason to believe\n\n\nNot every disclosure made by an employee will be protected. Only gradually are the courts beginning to consider the nature of a protected disclosure and the protection to be afforded to employees.\n\nIn \"Grieve v Denel\", the employee was busy preparing a report for the employer’s board of directors relating to allegations of wrongdoing by a manager. The employee found himself charged with misconduct, suspended and told to attend a disciplinary enquiry. He approached the Labour Court for an interdict to stop the employer’s taking disciplinary action. The court held that the disclosures the employee intended to make were in good faith, and that, if the allegations were true, they could indicate possible criminal conduct. The disclosures were held to fall within the ambit of protection. The employer was ordered not to proceed with the pending disciplinary action.\n\nIn \"CWU v Mobile Telephone Networks\", the Labour Court held that an employee’s accusation of fraud by management did not constitute a protected disclosure; it was merely the employee’s opinion and was not supported by any facts.\n\nThe procedure for resolving unfair-labour-practice disputes is similar to the dispute resolution for unfair dismissals.\n\nFirst, the dispute must be referred to a bargaining council (or the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration if there is no bargaining council) for conciliation.\n\nIf conciliation does not succeed, the matter may be referred to arbitration.\n\nUnlike unfair dismissal disputes, unfair-labour-practice disputes are required, by section 191 of the Labour Relations Act 1995, to be referred within ninety days of the relevant act or omission, or ninety days from the date on which the employee became aware of the act or occurrence.\n\nIn terms of section 193(4) of the Labour Relations Act 1995, an arbitrator has the power to determine any unfair labour practice dispute on \"reasonable terms,\" which may include ordering reinstatement, re-employment or compensation (of up to twelve months' pay).\n\nThe onus is on the employee to prove all the elements of the alleged unfair labour practice in question.\n\nSeen generally, there are three mechanisms designed to protect the individual employee:\n\n\nThe fourth mechanism of protection is protection against unfair discrimination.\n\nThe Labour Relations Act 1995 was the first piece of legislation to deal with discrimination in the workplace.\n\nThe EEA also contains detailed provisions to counteract and eliminate discrimination in the workplace.\n\nThe Constitution, with its right to equality, provides an important constitutional context for employment equity. A consideration of this constitutional provision indicates that the elimination of discrimination has two bases:\n\n\nSection 6 of the EEA contains the main thrust of the Act's prohibition against unfair discrimination. It provides that\n\nno person may unfairly discriminate, directly or indirectly, against an employee, in any employment policy or practice, on one or more grounds, including race, gender, sex, pregnancy, marital status, family responsibility, ethnic or social origin, colour, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, HIV status, conscience, belief, political opinion, culture, language and birth.\n\nIt is not unfair discrimination\n\n\nHarassment of an employee is a form of unfair discrimination, and is prohibited on any of the above grounds.\n\nFurthermore, the EEA places a positive duty on every employer to take steps to promote equal opportunity in the workplace by eliminating unfair discrimination in any employment policy or practice. In certain circumstances there may be a duty on the employer to take reasonable measures to accommodate certain groups of employees.\n\nIn this regard, the Code of Good Practice: Key Aspects of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and Employment, together with the Code of Good Practice on the Employment of People with Disabilities, provides guidelines on how HIV/AIDS and disability should be dealt with and accommodated in the workplace.\n\nThis is the only legislative provision that mentions human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status as a prohibited ground of discrimination. Its inclusion makes section 6 of the EEA even wider than section 9 of the Constitution.\n\nSection 6 protects only an \"employee,\" but it does not speak only of an employer; it provides that \"no person\" may discriminate. This is broader, and may include, \"inter alia\", an independent pension fund or an independent medical aid scheme, or even a fellow employee.\n\nIn this regard, if an employee lodges a complaint of discrimination against another employee, and the employer does not consult in an attempt to eliminate the discrimination, the employer may be held liable.\n\nThe difference between discrimination and differentiation must always be kept in mind, as not all differentiations amount to discrimination. There may be a fair differentiation between employees on the basis, for example, of educational qualifications or experience or seniority.\n\nGenerally, differentiation will amount to discrimination if it is based on an unacceptable reason. Even if the discrimination suffered is not listed in section 6(1) of the EEA, it would amount to discrimination if, objectively, it is based on attributes and characteristics which have the potential to impair the fundamental human dignity of persons as human beings, or to affect them adversely in a comparably serious manner.\n\nOnce the employee has proven that there has been a differentiation, the EEA and Constitution provide that it is presumed to have been unfair discrimination. The employer then bears the onus of proving the differentiation to be fair.\n\nDiscrimination may be direct or indirect:\n\n\nThe EEA provides that harassment amounts to \"a form of unfair discrimination,\" and as such is prohibited. The most prevalent forms of harassment encountered in the workplace are\n\n\nOf these, sexual harassment is by far the most common.\n\nThe Code of Good Practice on Handling of Sexual Harassment Cases lists three types of conduct which could constitute sexual harassment:\n\n\nAnother way to define sexual harassment is to consider the effect of the harassment. Three types of harassment may be so identified:\n\n\nThe questions remain: From whose perspective does one analyse the conduct to see if it amounts to sexual harassment? What test does one apply? Does one look to the way in which the victim experienced the situation (a subjective test), or does one try to be more objective?\n\n\nDecided cases are inconsistent on which test should be used.\n\nThe Code of Good Practice states that sexual harassment is \"unwanted conduct of a sexual nature.\" This implies a subjective test. It goes on to say, however, that sexual attention will only become sexual harassment\n\n\nThe Code thus adopts a mixture of the subjective and the objective test.\n\nThe EEA states that the employer may be held liable if he was made aware of the conduct but did nothing, or did not do everything that could be expected of a reasonable employer.\n\nFurthermore, the Code provides that, as a first step in expressing concern about and commitment to dealing with the problem of sexual harassment, employers should issue a policy statement, stipulating the following:\n\n\nThe Code recommends that management be given a positive duty to implement the policy, and to take disciplinary action against employees who do not comply with it. A policy on sexual harassment should explain the procedure to be followed by employees who are victims of sexual harassment. The policy should also state the following:\n\n\nFinally, the Code recommends that policy statements on sexual harassment be communicated effectively to all employees.\n\nThe employee who resigns due to sexual harassment may argue that this was a constructive dismissal, which would provide grounds for finding an automatically unfair dismissal.\n\nA victim of harassment may institute a civil claim, based on delict, against the perpetrator; she may also institute a claim against the employer, based on the common-law principles of vicarious liability.\n\nThe EEA prohibits medical testing of an employee, unless\n\n\nTesting may be justifiable in the light of\n\n\nJob applicants are also protected from medical testing.\n\nThe EEA prohibits \"psychological and other similar assessments\" of employees, unless such an assessment\n\n\nThe EEA lists HIV status as one of the grounds on which an employee may not be discriminated against. South African Airways, for example, formerly had a policy of not employing HIV-positive employees as cabin attendants, partly because it believed that HIV-positive people could not have vaccinations, a requirement for international travel, and were at risk of infection, which might be transmitted to others.\n\nIn \"Hoffman v South African Airways\", the court found that people living with HIV constitute a minority, to which society has responded with intense prejudice, stigmatization and marginalization. Society's response has forced many of them not to reveal their HIV status, for fear of such prejudice, and has thus deprived them of the help they would otherwise have received. This stigmatization the court considered an assault on their dignity.\n\nThe EEA is designed to counteract\n\n\nSuch testing is prohibited unless it is held to be justifiable by the Labour Court, which may impose various conditions on such testing, including\n\n\nEmployers may make HIV testing available to employees as part of a \"wellness\" program, provided that it takes place confidentially and on the basis of informed consent. Authorisation from the Labour Court is not required for such testing.\n\nThe EEA does not forbid anonymous testing undertaken for epidemiological purposes, or to establish the prevalence of HIV/AIDS among the workforce.\n\nIn \"Joy Mining Machinery v NUMSA\", the court held that the following considerations should be taken into account in determining whether or not HIV testing is justifiable:\n\n\nThe court will also want to be informed about the following, which do not go to the question of justifiability, but which are also relevant to arriving at a proper decision:\n\n\nThere is also a Code of Good Practice on Key Aspects of HIV/AIDS and Employment, which provides guidelines to employers and employees on how to deal with HIV/AIDS in general.\n\nWith regard to HIV/AIDS and disability, the Code states that an employee who has become too ill to work may be dismissed on grounds of incapacity. A mental or physical impairment will constitute a disability only if it is \"substantially limiting\" in respect of entry into, or advancement in, employment.\n\nA dispute about unfair discrimination must be referred to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration for conciliation within six months of the alleged discriminatory act or omission.\n\nDisputes of this nature may not be referred to a bargaining council.\n\nIn referring the dispute to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration, the referring party must indicate that it has made a reasonable attempt to resolve the dispute, depending on the circumstances.\n\nIf conciliation fails, the matter may be referred to the Labour Court, unless the parties consent to the jurisdiction of the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration for arbitration.\n\nThe Labour Court may make any appropriate order that is \"just and equitable\" in the circumstances, including compensation, damages, and orders directing the employer to take preventative steps.\n\nAgain, once the employee proves that there was discrimination, the onus shifts to the employer to prove that the discrimination was fair.\n\nAlongside the prohibition against unfair discrimination, affirmative action is the second cornerstone of the EEA.\n\nAccording to section 2(b) of the EEA, the goal of affirmative action is to ensure the equitable representation of certain groups in all occupational categories and levels in the workplace.\n\n\"Equitable representation\" is not defined in the EEA, but section 42 states that it may be determined by a consideration of\n\n\nAffirmative action is, by its very nature, a temporary measure. Once the goal of equality in the workplace has been achieved, the reason for the measure will fall away.\n\nA potential beneficiary of affirmative action must meet two requirements:\n\n\nThere are, in this regard, four key definitions in the EEA:\n\n\nEmployees from one of the designated groups may approach the Labour Court, citing unfair discrimination, to enforce a lack of affirmative action. The Labour Court has held, however, that there is no \"individual\" right to affirmative action, which is collective in nature.\n\nThe prohibition of unfair discrimination applies to all employers, regardless of their size, but the affirmative-action provisions of the EEA apply only to \"designated employers.\"\n\nA \"designated employer\" is defined as follows:\n\n\nEmployers that do not fall within the ambit of this definition may still voluntarily indicate that they intend to comply with the Act.\n\nThe employment-equity plan is the centrepiece of the procedure for implementing affirmative action in the workplace.\n\nA designated employer has to consult with the workforce on\n\n\nThe analysis described above must also contain a profile of the employer's workforce. Using this profile, the employer must determine the degree of under-representation of people from designated groups in the various categories and levels.\n\nThe employment-equity plan must include\n\n\nIf there is an under-representation of people from designated groups, the plan must also outline\n\n\nA copy of the plan must be made available to employees. The designated employer must assign one or more senior manager the responsibility and authority and means to monitor and implement the plan.\n\nDesignated employers must submit reports to the Department of Labour:\n\n\nDesignated employers are required to submit a statement to the Employment Conditions Commission about the remuneration and benefits received by employees in each occupational category and level. If this statement reflects disproportionate income differentials, the employer must take steps progressively to reduce such differentials.\n\nThe EEA provides for four ways in which compliance with its affirmative-action provisions may be ensured:\n\n\nEmployment equity plans must include dispute-resolution procedures. Employers and employees must use these procedures first.\n\nA labour inspector, with reasonable grounds for believing that an employer is not complying with the EEA, may try to obtain a written undertaking from the employer that he will comply. If he refuses, the inspector may issue a compliance order, to which the employer may object within 21 days.\n\nThe Labour Court has the power\n\n\nDesignated employers who wish to enter into commercial contracts with organs of state must comply with the EEA. They must attach to their offer either\n\n\nIf these requirements are not met, the organ of state may reject the offer; it may even constitute grounds for the cancellation of a contract that has already been concluded.\n\nThe common law afforded the employee virtually no protection against unfair dismissal. Before the Labour Relations Act (LRA), as long as the employer gave the required period of notice, dismissal or probation was acceptable. The common law focused only on the lawfulness of the employment contract itself; the reason for the dismissal was irrelevant. The employer was not required to give the employee an explanation for the termination; nor was there any requirement that the dismissal be fair.\n\nThis had the effect of increasing the bargaining power of the employer, who could, essentially, do as he pleased, because of his more powerful position. The employer could threaten to dismiss the employee if the latter refused to accept less favourable terms and conditions of employment. The reason for this, it has been contended, is that, prior to 1980, this area of law was based on the incorrect assumption that there existed equal bargaining power between employer and employee.\n\nSouth Africa has since subscribed to international labour standards, in the form of International Labour Organization (ILO) instruments like the Termination of Employment Convention, 1982, which provides that an employer must have a fair reason to terminate the employment contract, and that the reason for dismissal must fall into one of three broad categories:\n\n\nMisconduct relates to the behaviour of the worker, usually involving some fault on his part, like insubordination, assault, theft, dishonesty, frequent late-coming or intimidation of co-workers.\n\nCapacity relates to the worker's ability to do his job. It includes incompetence or incapability for medical reasons (ill health or injury). It is viewed as a no-fault dismissal.\n\nOperational requirements relate not to the employee, but rather to the business enterprise of the employer. If an employee is dismissed on this ground, his is a no-fault dismissal. The most common form that this category takes is dismissal based on the economic needs of the business, or on the employer's need to restructure the organisation.\n\nThe Convention states further that employers must notify employees or their representatives that dismissal is contemplated, and must provide relevant information to them. The employer is obliged to consult regarding measures to minimise the number of dismissals, and also to mitigate the adverse effects of dismissal.\n\nUnfair dismissal is now governed by the Labour Relations Act. Some have argued that the Labour Relations Act undermines the flexibility required for the free market to exist. Others have argued that a restrictive labour law promotes job security, loyalty and incorporation into companies.\n\nThe Labour Relations Act provides for the right not to be unfairly dismissed or subjected to unfair labour practices.\n\nOnly employees have the right not to be unfairly dismissed; non-employees enjoy no such protection. The Labour Relations Act's approach to unfair dismissal may be summarised in the following three questions:\n\n\nThe employee has the onus to establish that there has in fact been a dismissal. If this is discharged, the onus shifts to the employer, who prove the fairness of the dismissal.\n\n\"Dismissal\" is the termination of the employment relationship by the employer, with or without notice. It can also entail\n\n\nAn employer who has dismissed a number of employees for the same or similar reasons, but who now offers to re-employ one or more of them, while refusing to re-employ another, will have dismissed the latter.\n\nThe statutory definition also recognises as constituting dismissal certain circumstances in which the \"employee\" terminates the employment relationship. This is known as constructive dismissal.\n\nWhere, for example, an employee terminates a contract of employment, with or without notice, because the employer has made continued employment intolerable for him, he will have been constructively dismissed.\n\nAn employee may also be regarded as having been constructively dismissed if he terminates a contract of employment, with or without notice, because his new employer, after a transfer of the business as a going concern, provided him with conditions or circumstances at work which are substantially less favourable than those provided by his former employer.\n\nSection 186(1)(a) of the Labour Relations Act refers to the standard form of dismissal. Either the employee is given notice of the termination, or his contract of employment is terminated by way of summary termination. Note, again, that only \"employees\" may be dismissed.\n\nThe requisite period of notice may be expressly stated in the contract itself, in terms of a statute such as the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, or even in terms of a collective agreement. In terms of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act,\n\n\nSummary termination by the employer may be justified if the employee has committed a serious or fundamental breach of a material term of the contract.\n\nIn \"CSIR v Fijen\", an employee and his employer had quarrelled during negotiations, with the employee declaring their relationship \"finished,\" and the employer interpreting this as a resignation. The employee subsequently denied having resigned; what he meant, he argued, was that the working relationship had become intolerable. The court held that, in the absence of a clear and unambiguous intention to quit, there could not have been a proper resignation. The employer, therefore, was mistaken in its interpretation of his words.\n\nThere were indications, in \"Ouwehand v Hout Bay Fishing\", that the employee would be retrenched. Representations were made to him that he should find other work. He stopped going to work, therefore, on the assumption that he had been dismissed. The court, however, held that he had resigned, because the onus is on the employee to show that he has been dismissed. The employee in this case did not discharge that onus.\n\nWhen dismissal may be effected is a question of some practical importance. It relates to the question regarding the commencement of employment: Does it commence when the contract is concluded, or rather when the employee starts working? The difficulty is that there may be a significant lapse of time between these two events.\n\nThe Labour Court held, in \"Whitehead v Woolworths\", that, to qualify as an employee, it was insufficient for the employee to prove that a contract of employment had been concluded. The conclusion of the contract merely gives rise to contractual claims; it does not confer the status of an employee or employer on the parties for the purposes of the Labour Relations Act. \"In terms of the definition,\" Waglay AJ found,\n\na person is only an employee when such person actually works for another person. The employee must therefore have rendered a service to another which services are not that [\"sic\"] of an independent contractor. In addition to working for another the employee must also \"receive\" or be \"entitled to receive\" remuneration. The remuneration referred to must correspondingly mean remuneration for work done or tendered to be done.\n\nTwo subsequent decisions of the Labour Court, in \"Jack v Director-General, Department of Environmental Affairs\" and \"Wyeth SA v Manqele\", have taken a different approach.\n\nThe rights and remedies of a job applicant were considered in \"Jack\", where the employer breached the contract by not allowing the party to commence work on the agreed date. The Labour Court, having examined the question of whether or not there was an employment relationship between the parties, decided that, once the parties have reached agreement on all the essential terms of the contract, it will be binding and enforceable.\n\nIn \"Wyeth\", employer and employee had concluded a written contract on 15 March providing that the employee would commence work on 1 April. Before work commenced, the employer informed the employee that it was no longer prepared to employ him. The Labour Court held that the term \"employee\" in the Labour Relations Act encompasses a person who has concluded a contract to work, and that such person would also enjoy protection against unfair dismissal. This is in line with a purposive interpretation of the definition of \"employee.\"\n\nThe employment relationship is wider than the employment contract. While the contract of employment is the foundation of the relationship, the relationship may begin before the employee commences working, and may endure for some time after the contract has been terminated. It ought also to be noted that, although abscondment by the employee constitutes a breach of contract, this by itself does not necessarily bring the contract to an end. Only when the employer \"accepts\" the employee's repudiation of the contract may it be said that there has been a dismissal.\n\nIn some cases, an employment relationship is terminated by neither the employer nor the employee, but by operation of law. This occurs, for example, when an employee's residence or work permit expires, and is sometimes called \"automatic dismissal.\"\n\nThe employee must have a \"reasonable\" expectation that the fixed-term contract will be renewed. He bears the onus of proving that the expectation of continued or permanent employment is reasonable. The test is objective, inquiring into whether or not a reasonable person would anticipate renewal in such circumstances.\n\nIn addition, the employer must have created the impression that such an expectation was justified. The following are among the ways in which the employer or his representative may create such an impression:\n\n\nThere must, then, be some form of \"prior promise or past practice.\" An offer on less favourable terms is also subject to the reasonable-expectation test.\n\nIn \"SA Rugby v CCMA\", the coach of the team indicated to certain players that he had \"plans for them.\" When it came to choosing the side, however, certain of those players were not even sent to training, and therefore were ineligible for the renewal of their contracts. It was held that the coach's representations to the players were such that they had a reasonable expectation of renewal.\n\nWhat about the reasonable expectation of a permanent position? In \"Dierks v Unisa\", the employee had been employed by means of a series of fixed-term contracts. He argued that he had been unfairly retrenched, and that he was entitled to a permanent position. It is important to draw a distinction between the employee's two expectations:\n\n\nThe court held that section 186(1)(b) relates to the first expectation only, but the Labour Court later found, in \"McInnes v Technikon Natal\", that its decision in \"Dierks\" had been incorrect. It took the view that the focus should be on the nature of the expectation, and whether or not in the circumstances the expectation was reasonable. \"In casu\", the employee genuinely believed that she would be doing the same work as before, the only difference being that her appointment would in future be permanent. In this case, the \"similar terms\" referred to included the reasonable expectation of permanent employment on similar terms.\n\nThe uncertainty continued with \"Auf Der Heyde v University of Cape Town\", where the Labour Court accepted that the approach in \"Dierks\" was correct, and that section 186(1)(b) did not include a reasonable expectation of permanent employment. This case, however, went on appeal, where the judge found it unnecessary in the circumstances to decide the issue.\n\nThe Basic Conditions of Employment Act provides for four months' maternity leave, but does not require that it be paid. It is possible, however, for an employee to make a claim in terms of the Unemployment Insurance (UIF) Act. Individual or collective agreements may provide for paid maternity leave.\n\nAn important concession in the Basic Conditions of Employment Act is that no employee may be expected to work for the first six weeks after the birth of her baby, but a midwife or medical practitioner may certify that she is fit to work if the employee wishes to do so. An employer's refusal to allow an employee to return to work after she has been on maternity leave (paid or unpaid) will now fall within the ambit of \"dismissal\" for the purposes of the Labour Relations Act. If an employee does not return to work within the period permitted, this will probably be viewed as abscondment, in which case the normal sanctions will apply.\n\nIn a sense, in cases of selective re-employment, the employment relationship continues even after the employment contract itself has been terminated. Three elements are essential:\n\n\nThe essential feature of a constructive dismissal is that the employee terminates the employment contract. His resignation is not entirely voluntary, however, as it is brought about or necessitated by the actions or omissions of the employer. These actions must be \"intolerable.\" The employee, in resigning, indicates that he would have carried on work indefinitely had not the intolerable situation been created.\n\nIn considering whether or not there has in fact been a constructive dismissal, the courts will ask the following questions:\n\n\nThis is a relatively new form of statutory dismissal, added in terms of the 2002 amendment to the LRA. If a business is transferred, the employees must be transferred with it, and employed on the same or similar terms and conditions. Failure on the part of the new employer to do so constitutes dismissal.\n\nThis area of the law is highly problematic. The LRA states that certain dismissals are automatically unfair; there is no argument as to their fairness. The compensation payable to an employee who has been dismissed for reasons that constitute automatic unfairness is up to 24 months' salary, depending on the circumstances. For a normal, merely unfair dismissal, the compensation is up to twelve months' salary.\n\nSection 187 of the LRA lists the reasons for which an employee may not be dismissed under any circumstances. Such dismissals are \"automatically unfair.\" Once it is proved that the employee has been dismissed for any of these reasons, the employer may not raise any defence save those provided for in the Act. Victims of automatically unfair dismissals will invariably be reinstated unless they choose compensation instead.\n\nSection 187(1)(d) is of particular importance. It designates as automatically unfair dismissals in response to the employee's taking action, or indicating an intention to take any action, against the employer by exercising any right conferred by the LRA, or by participating in any proceedings in terms of the LRA. Dismissal for any conduct regarding membership of a trade union, or for exercising the rights conferred by the labour legislation, is automatically unfair.\n\nThe rights referred to are found in section 5 of the LRA. They include lawful trade-union participation, non-compliance with an unlawful order and disclosure of information.\n\nIn \"CEPPWAWU & another v Glass & Aluminium\", hostility from the employer in the workplace led to a constructive dismissal. The hostility was very closely related to the employee's work as shop steward. The court held that the employer had made the employee's life unbearable due to the fact that he was a shop steward; the dismissal was therefore automatically unfair. The court noted that victims of automatically unfair dismissal will invariably be reinstated unless they choose compensation instead.\n\nThis is a factual dispute. Whether the facts give rise to an automatically unfair dismissal, or merely an unfair dismissal, depends on the circumstances of each case.\n\nSection 5 confers on employees a right to freedom of association and the right to belong to workplace forums. No employee may be dismissed for exercising these freedoms in any way: for example,\n\n\nSection 5 further prohibits prejudicing employees for failing or refusing to do anything that an employer may not lawfully require of him.\n\nNo dismissal is permitted for the disclosure of information which the employee is lawfully entitled or required to communicate to other persons, or for exercising any right or participating in any proceedings in terms of the LRA. The mere fact that employees are exercising a right under the LRA does not mean, however, that they are immunised against disciplinary action for misconduct committed outside the scope of their duties.\n\nThe LRA distinguishes between protected and unprotected strikes. The dismissal of an employee for participating in a protected strike is automatically unfair. Participants in protected strikes, however, may be dismissed for misconduct (assault, for example, or intimidation) during the course of the strike.\n\nIn cases where it is difficult to distinguish between a dismissal for striking and a dismissal for (by way of example) misconduct, the \"true\" and \"proximate\" cause of the dismissal must be identified.\n\nSection 65(5) provides that participation in a strike which does not comply with the provisions of the LRA is misconduct. It \"may constitute a fair reason for dismissal,\" but there are specific procedures to follow.\n\nIn terms of section 187(1)(c), employers may not threaten employees with disciplinary action if they do not comply with a demand: a salary decrease, for example. The Labour Court has considered situations in which employees are threatened with dismissal for refusing to accept unilateral amendments of their terms and conditions of employment by their employers. In this regard,\n\n\nEmployers may lock out employees (provided that they follow the proper procedure) as a bargaining strategy. A lock-out does not constitute dismissal, as the employees are still employed by the employer.\n\nThe difficulty is that an employer may argue that he has the right to dismiss, for operational reasons, those employees who do not accept such a demand. It can be factually difficult in such cases to determine what was the true reason for the dismissal.\n\nSection 187(1)(c) does not prevent employers from dismissing employees who refuse to accept a demand if the effect of that dismissal is to save other workers from retrenchment. Nor does this form of automatically unfair dismissal preclude an employer from dismissing a grossly insubordinate employee.\n\nIn \"Afrox Limited v SACWU & Others\", the company had a distribution system that resulted in its drivers working in excess of the overtime permitted by law. It decided to introduce a system of staggered shifts to overcome the problem. The employees, refusing to work under the new system, went on strike. They were subsequently dismissed for \"operational reasons\", as the deliveries from the branch that had been striking were outsourced. The employees contended that the real reason why they were fired was because they were on strike. The court held that, although the strike accelerated the dismissal, the workers did not comply with the Basic Conditions of Employment Act when they went on strike; therefore, regardless of the strike, the dismissal on operational reasons was upheld as fair.\n\nIn \"Fry's Metal v NUMSA\", the court held that the dismissal of employees who refuse to accept a demand does not infringe section 187(c) if the employer intends to get rid of the workers permanently. In this case, the dismissal was not in an attempt to force compliance; it had gone so far as to constitute operational reasons.\n\nIn \"CWIU v Algorax (Pty) Ltd\", Algorax had not formally declared a lock-out. The court held, therefore, that the employer had infringed section 187(1)(c), because it offered to reinstate the employees after dismissing them. Had Algorax formally declared the lock-out, it would seem that it could have kept the employees out for as long as it did without having to compensate them for unfair dismissal.\n\nIn retrenchment cases, it is difficult to decide when an employer is entitled to dismiss for insubordination when employees refuse to comply with instructions. One must distinguish between refusal to work and refusal to do work in the specific way required by the employer. A computer technician refusing to fix computers is refusing to work, but an employee refusing to use a particular computer programme is refusing to do work in a specific way.\n\nIf the employees are contractually obliged to perform the work demanded of them, and the employer's instructions are reasonable, the employees' refusal amounts to insubordination. It is not unfair to dismiss employees for refusing to comply with their employers' instructions to perform the work required by their contracts.\n\nWhat if the employee refuses to carry out an order not in accordance with the contract, but with how the employer runs his business? This will depend on the facts: If the instructions are reasonable, such refusal could amount to insubordination.\n\nIn \"Kroukam v SA Airlink\", Kroukam was an airline pilot who doubled as a shop steward. He was dismissed after deposing to an affidavit for the purposes of an urgent application by his union to have the company's senior manager committed for contempt of court. He was charged with a number of offences, including gross insubordination. The company claimed that he had divulged the content of an off-the-record discussion in his affidavit, and also that he had refused to submit to a health test required of pilots. The Labour Court ruled that this was not an automatically unfair dismissal. On appeal, however, the court held unanimously that the main or dominant reason for Kroukam's dismissal was his involvement in litigation against the company. The court held, accordingly, that such a dismissal was indeed automatically unfair.\n\nSection 187(1)(e) is one of a number of statutory provisions aimed at protecting women in employment. Prior to these types of provisions, a woman who left work to have a baby was largely at the mercy of her employer. Under the common law, her absence could be treated as a reason for termination of the contract.\n\nNow, according to the EEA and the LRA, dismissal is unlawful if it is for any reason regarding pregnancy or discrimination on the ground of pregnancy. The employee has no duty to inform her employer that she is pregnant; the employer has no right to ask and demand an answer. Accordingly, a woman may not now be dismissed in any circumstances merely because she is pregnant.\n\nSection 187(1)(e) also renders impermissible the dismissal of a woman on maternity leave (now up to four months under the new Basic Conditions of Employment Act).\n\nNothing precludes an employer from dismissing a pregnant employee for operational requirements, provided that the court can be persuaded that there was indeed a valid economic or related reason.\n\nIn \"Whitehead v Woolworths\", the court held that an employer may have regard to economic considerations, including the woman's availability to perform her services, when considering whether to employ a pregnant applicant.\n\nSection 187(1)(e) embraces any reason \"related to her pregnancy.\" It therefore includes reasonable absences for medical attention and changes in the woman's physical configuration, which may dispose certain employers to fire employees engaged in certain types of work.\n\nIf the main reason for the dismissal is the employee's pregnancy, the employer may not rely on an ancillary reason like the employee's alleged deceit in not disclosing her condition. Conversely, a pregnant woman may not rely on her pregnancy as a defence against conduct that constitutes a disciplinary offence.\n\nMashava, in \"Mashava v Cuzen & Woods Attorneys\", was admitted as a candidate attorney at the firm. At the time of her employment, she was pregnant. She did not disclose this. The firm accordingly dismissed her, but the court held that this was automatically unfair. The employer could not rely on her deceit regarding her condition as a reason for dismissal.\n\nFair dismissals are composed of two golden threads: substantive fairness and procedural fairness. Both must be present in order for the dismissal to be fair and in accordance with the labour legislation. Employees may be dismissed fairly only for misconduct, incapacity and operational reasons. Each of these has its own procedure, which must be followed.\n\nAny person considering whether or not the reason for dismissal is fair, or whether or not the dismissal was effected in accordance with a fair procedure, must take into account any relevant code of good practice issued in terms of the Act.\n\nDismissal is the most severe penalty that an employer may impose against an employee guilty of misconduct. In determining whether or not dismissal is appropriate in the circumstances of a case, the employer may have to weigh up a number of factors to come to a decision.\n\nGenerally, the employer has the right to maintain and enforce discipline in the workplace. This right has its origin in common law as an implied term in the contract of employment. It is also inextricably linked to the employee’s duty to obey all lawful and reasonable instructions, and is linked to the employer’s right to give instructions. Today the employer’s right to discipline is regulated to a certain degree by the LRA and the Code of Good Practice: Dismissal, annexed to the LRA as Schedule 8 (the Code).\n\nUnder the common law, the employer may summarily dismiss the employee if the latter’s misconduct is serious, or dismiss the employee merely by giving the required notice. Occasionally, the employer may prefer to impose a less severe penalty, but the employer’s action in imposing a penalty may not amount to a breach of contract. Suspension without pay or demotion, or ordering forfeiture of an agreed bonus or part of the wages, would constitute a breach of contract. The employer may, however, suspend the employee on full pay and give warnings.\n\nThe effectiveness of these penalties was questionable. Suspension on full pay, for example, was found to have little deterrent effect. In practice, the employer’s superior bargaining power, and his right to dismiss merely by giving notice, meant that the employer could \"convince\" the employee to agree to a penalty which would otherwise have amounted to a breach of contract.\n\nThe Code of Good Practice recognizes the employer’s common-law right to discipline employees by requiring, in item 3(1), that \"all employers should adopt disciplinary rules which establish the standard of conduct required of employees.\"\n\nIf an agreed disciplinary code exists in the workplace, item 1(2) of the Code stipulates that disciplinary action against employees must comply with the disciplinary code and procedure.\n\nIf, however, the disciplinary code was unilaterally introduced by the employer, or if no such code exists, regard must be had to the Code’s provisions. The employer’s own code must be measured against the provisions of the Code; in the absence of an employer code, the Code will constitute the minimum guidelines for discipline.\n\nThe Code accepts that the form of the employer’s disciplinary rules will vary according to the size and nature of the business, but these rules must be clear and made available to employees so that there is certainty as to what the employer expects from them and as to what sort of behavior will not be tolerated.\n\nA disciplinary code may take the form of a collective agreement between the employer and a trade union or unions; it may be a policy unilaterally imposed by the employer; or it may be incorporated into the terms and conditions of employment.\n\nVery often a recognition agreement, in terms of which the employer recognizes one or more trade unions as the collective bargaining agent of a certain category of employees, will include, as an annexure, an agreed disciplinary code and procedure. In this way, a disciplinary code and procedure obtains the status of a collective agreement.\n\nThe Code accepts that the content of a disciplinary code will vary according to the size and nature of the employer’s business. Some rules of conduct may be so well established and well known that it is unnecessary for the employer to communicate them to the employees. An employee who breaches such a rule cannot argue that the rule does not appear in the written disciplinary code. A rule will be so well established that it need not be communicated if the employees know that a particular act or omission will not be tolerated if the employer has always in the past disciplined employees who committed the particular act or omission.\n\nRules may also be considered to be well established by virtue of common-law contract principles, like a breach of the duty to act in good faith. Examples of acts and omissions that are held to constitute such a breach include\n\n\nEmployer disciplinary codes usually contain the disciplinary sanctions for each type of disciplinary infraction and the procedure to be followed.\n\nIn some cases, the industrial court has drawn a distinction between theft and petty pilfering, and has required that, to justify dismissal, the offence at issue should disclose a \"thieving propensity\" on the part of the employee. In Anglo American Farms Boschendal Restaurant v Komjwayo, however, this distinction was rejected. The court held that the true test was whether or not the employee’s action had the effect of rendering the relationship of employer and employee intolerable. Although it has been somewhat more lenient in some cases, the CCMA has generally followed a strict approach in cases of theft and other forms of dishonesty.\n\nDue to South Africa’s apartheid past, racist abuse is viewed in a particularly serious light. In Lebowa Platinum Mines v Hill, an employee was dismissed for calling another employee a \"bobbejaan\" (baboon). The court held the dismissal to be justified because the court found that the term had a racist connotation.\n\nIn terms of the common law, the employer may either condone the misconduct or elect to act against the employee. If the misconduct is of a sufficiently serious nature, the employer may decide to cancel the contract of employment and dismiss the employee.\n\nDismissal is only one of a number of penalties that the employer may impose against the guilty employee. Examples of other penalties are\n\n\nThe Code emphasizes the concept of corrective or progressive discipline. Item 3(2) requires that the employer try to correct employees’ behavior through a system of graduated disciplinary measures such as counselling and warnings. Formal disciplinary procedures do not have to be invoked every time a rule is broken. Informal advice and correction is the best way to deal with minor violations of work discipline.\n\nWarnings may be graded according to degrees of severity, as with a verbal warning for a first offence, then a first written warning, then a final written warning or suspension without pay or demotion, and finally dismissal, which is reserved for repeated offences or serious misconduct. Item 3(4) gives a list of examples of serious misconduct that may result in a disciplinary enquiry and possible dismissal for a first occurrence. The list includes\n\n\nAs stated before, section 188(1) of the LRA requires that, if misconduct is the reason for dismissal, it must be with fair reason. Item 7 of the Code provides some guidelines as to when misconduct will constitute a fair reason for dismissal. The following must be considered:\n\n\nThe guidelines in item 7 for a substantively fair dismissal are not hard and fast rules. The employer’s non-compliance with a particular guideline will not necessarily make the dismissal unfair. The question of whether or not non-compliance with a particular guideline is permissible depends on the circumstances.\n\nThere are two issues to be considered under this heading. In the first instance, it must be determined whether or not the rule existed; in the second, if the rule existed, it must be determined whether or not the employee contravened it.\n\nThe formulation of disciplinary rules is the responsibility of the employer. The most important source of these rules is a written disciplinary code or rules of conduct. If such a written code or set of rules exists, it must be examined to determine whether the rule which the employee is accused of having contravened is contained in that code. If the disciplinary code does not contain the rule under consideration, this may be an important indicator that such a rule does not exist in the particular workplace.\n\nIf the particular rule which the employee is accused of having contravened is not included in the written code, this does not necessarily mean that the employee’s dismissal is unfair.\n\nThe particular rule may be contained in\n\n\nLegislation such as the Occupational Health and Safety Act may also regulate the conduct of employees. Sections 14 and 15 impose a number of duties on employees, such as\n\n\nAnother important source for rules is the common law, which includes, for example, the duty to act in good faith.\n\nItem 7(a) of the Code provides that one may also consider whether the employee contravened a rule regulating conduct \"in, or of relevance to the workplace.\" The provision is broad enough to entitle the employer to proceed against the employee who has contravened a rule after working hours, or even outside the premises of the employer. The circumstances that this is possible are limited, however, to those situations where the misconduct in some way affects or is otherwise relevant to the employer’s business.\n\nOnce it has been established that the rule exists, the next issue to be addressed is whether or not the employee has contravened it. This is an issue which must be determined on the facts. If, for example, the employee is charged with unauthorised possession of company property, this must be proven in the circumstances.\n\nSection 192(2) of the LRA states that it is the employer who must prove that the dismissal was fair; therefore the employer must prove that the employee has contravened the rule. Neither the LRA nor the Code stipulates the standard by which the employer must prove the employee’s contravention of the rule, but it is submitted that the employer must prove the contravention on a balance of probabilities.\n\nThe LRA and the Code also do not stipulate on what facts the employer may rely to prove the contravention. The Industrial Court has given conflicting opinions on whether the employer is restricted to relying on those facts which are available at the time of the enquiry, or whether he may also rely on facts which came to light after the dismissal. It is submitted that the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration will probably adopt the second approach.\n\nOnce it is clear that the rule existed and the employee actually contravened it, attention must be focused on the rule itself. The first aspect which must be determined is whether the rule is valid or reasonable. This is a factual question. Generally a rule will be valid or reasonable if it is lawful and can be justified with reference to the needs and circumstances of the business. Factors which may determine whether or not a rule is justified include the following:\n\n\nAn important indicator of the validity or reasonableness of a rule is its inclusion in a disciplinary code that is contained in a collective agreement between the employer and a trade union. Unlike the rule the employer unilaterally enforces, this rule is the product of collective bargaining.\n\nThe reasonableness of a rule may be affected by the employer’s preparedness in the past to enforce it. If it has not been enforced in the past, it may be an indication that the employer does not regard the rule as reasonable. The employer’s failure to enforce a rule does not make that rule permanently invalid, however. It may regain its validity if the employer clearly and unequivocally informs the employees that the rule will be enforced in the future.\n\nThe fundamental issue is that the employer cannot act against the employee if the latter is unaware that the employer now regards a breach of the rule as serious.\n\nThe employee must have known, or could reasonably be expected to have been aware, of the rule. The rationale for this is that the employee should only be penalised for actions or omissions which the employee knew (at the time) were unacceptable. It is implied that the employee must also have known that a transgression of this rule may lead to dismissal.\n\nKnowledge of the rule may be achieved through\n\n\nCertain forms of misconduct may be so well known in the workplace that notification is unnecessary. This would be the case with theft assault, intimidation, insolence and insubordination.\n\nAn employer must, as far as possible, treat employees in the same way if they have committed the same or similar offences. The employer must be consistent, in other words, in meting out discipline.\n\nTwo types of inconsistency may be distinguished:\n\n\nInconsistency will not always be unfair. The employer can justify inconsistency through factors such as the employees’ different circumstances: length of service, for example, or disciplinary records and personal circumstances.\n\nIn SA Commercial Catering & Allied Workers Union v Bonus Building, the court held that, if a distinction is drawn between different employees, this distinction must be properly motivated; otherwise it will give rise to a perception of bias.\n\nThe court in City of Cape Town v Mashitho & Others found that, if an employer intends to discipline employees for misconduct which he has not disciplined them for in the past, the proper course is to make it known that such discipline will now be effected and the reasons for this change.\n\nWhether or not dismissal will be an appropriate sanction is a factual question. Item 3(5)-(6) of the Code lists factors to be taken into consideration. The employer should consider, in addition to the gravity of the misconduct, such factors as the employee’s circumstances (including length of service, previous disciplinary record and personal circumstances), the nature of the job and the circumstances of the infringement itself. The employer should apply the penalty of dismissal consistently with the way in which it has been applied to the same and other employees in the past, and consistently as between two or more employees who participate in the misconduct under consideration. All these factors must be considered and weighed up together to decide whether dismissal is justified or whether a less severe sanction would be more appropriate.\n\nIt has been submitted that, even if the commissioner does not consider dismissal to be the appropriate sanction after considering all these factors, the penalty of dismissal will stand if the commissioner or judge is satisfied that a reasonable employer could also have decided to dismiss under the circumstances.\n\nIn the case of Sidumo and Another v Rustenburg Platinum Mines Ltd and Others [2007] 12 BLLR 1097 (CC), however, a security guard at a mine was not abiding by the search procedures he was obliged to employ for the workers at the mine. There was video footage available as proof that he was not adequately searching the workers. The security guard was dismissed on the suspicion that he could be fraternising with the workers in order to steal from the mines. The CCMA having held that this sanction was too harsh, the case was appealed to the Labour Court and then to Labour Appeal Court. When the case reached the SCA, the court held that employers have a discretion to dismiss. If the employer acts reasonably, his decision must be upheld.\n\nOn appeal to the Constitutional Court, it was held that the commissioner who hears the appeal must decide afresh if the decision was fair or unfair; therefore, it is not appropriate to look to the reasonable employer. The SCA approach, therefore, was found to be wrong. The test is what the reasonable commissioner would have done in those circumstances. The court, then, is not bound by the choice made by the reasonable employer. The \"reasonable employer\" test is no longer used.\n\nThe more serious the misconduct, the greater the likelihood that dismissal is the appropriate penalty. The seriousness of the misconduct depends on a number of considerations:\n\n\nA serious offence does not automatically warrant the employee’s dismissal. It is not a \"knee-jerk response\" to all serious offences. There may be circumstances which have a tempering effect, not on the seriousness of the offence as such, but on the severity of the penalty: for example,\n\n\nIn the case of a brewery, the employer will be justified in taking a strict disciplinary approach regarding intoxication and the use of alcohol during working hours. A less strict approach to intoxication may be expected from an employer whose employees do not deal directly with the public or who do not work with dangerous machinery. This, however, does not mean that such an employer may never dismiss employees for intoxication; it only means that a greater measure of progressive discipline will be expected from such an employer.\n\nThese include the employee’s length of service, status within the undertaking, previous disciplinary record and personal circumstances.\n\nYears of service generally count in the employees favor. It must be noted, however, that the employer often puts a great deal of trust in an employee with long service; therefore, it could count against the employee if he breaches this trust after many years of service.\n\nThe employer will also expect a higher degree of responsible behavior from a supervisor or manager than from an ordinary worker.\n\nIf there is a previous warning on the employee’s personnel file, stating that he will be dismissed if the same offence is committed in future, dismissal may be fair if this occurs. A warning does not remain valid indefinitely. The employer and trade union may agree on the period for which a warning will remain valid, or the employer’s code may stipulate this. In the absence of such agreement or stipulation, the default position is that the warning remains valid for six months, unless the infraction is particularly serious, in which case it may remain valid for the duration of the employee’s service.\n\nOther personal circumstances which may be important include the employee’s age, marital status and number of dependents.\n\nThe employer must, as far as possible, treat employees the same if they have breached the same rule or rules which are similar: There must be consistency when meting out discipline.\n\nSection 188(1)(b) of the LRA requires that a dismissal for misconduct must be effected in accordance with a fair procedure, which entails a fair disciplinary enquiry. The LRA does not regulate a fair disciplinary enquiry. The employer’s disciplinary code and procedure usually prescribes the procedure to be followed and the manner in which the hearing should be conducted. The Code provides a number of guidelines for a fair enquiry in item 4: This is not a substitute for a disciplinary procedure but merely a template by which the fairness of a dismissal must be judged.\n\nNormally, the employer should conduct an investigation to determine whether there are grounds for dismissal. This does not need to be a formal enquiry. The employer should notify the employee of the allegations, using a form and language that the employee can reasonably understand. The employee should be allowed the opportunity to state a case in response to the allegations. The employee should also be entitled to a reasonable amount of time to prepare the response, and to the assistance of a trade union representative or fellow employee. After the enquiry, the employer should communicate the decision taken, and preferably furnish the employee with written notification of that decision.\n\nDiscipline against a trade union representative, or against an employee who is an office-bearer or official of a trade union, should not be instituted without first informing and consulting the trade union. If the employee is dismissed, the employee should be given the reason for dismissal and reminded of any rights to refer the matter to a council with jurisdiction or to the commission, or to any dispute resolution procedures established in terms of a collective agreement.\n\nIn exceptional circumstances, if the employer cannot reasonably be expected to comply with these guidelines, the employer may dispense with pre-dismissal procedures.\n\nThe purpose of the investigation is to determine whether or not there are grounds for dismissal. The investigation need not be a formal enquiry.\n\nThe employer must notify the employee of the allegations against him. The employer must use a form and language that the employee can reasonably understand. Usually the charge will be in writing and in the language which is commonly used in the workplace. Notice of the charge and of the disciplinary enquiry is usually given simultaneously and in the same document\n\nThe question of what is a \"reasonable time\" is a factual one. The nature and complexity of the charges will certainly be relevant in ascertaining whether the employee has had sufficient time. Whether the employee had assistance in preparing a response will also be relevant.\n\nThis is the core of procedural fairness in the context of dismissal for misconduct. The employee may dispute the facts on which the charges are based, or may plead guilty to the charges but argue that dismissal is not the appropriate sanction.\n\nThe employee is entitled to the assistance of a trade union representative or a fellow employee during the enquiry. \"Trade union representative\" is defined in section 213 of the LRA as a member of a trade union who is elected to represent employees in a workplace (commonly called a shop steward). \"Fellow employee\" includes a colleague, supervisor or even a director of the company for which the employee is working, provided that the director is also an employee.\n\nThe purpose of assistance is\n\n\nItem 4(1) does not provide for assistance by a legal practitioner, such as an advocate or attorney, but some disciplinary codes provide for legal representation under certain circumstances.\n\nThe decision as to whether or not an employee is guilty of the alleged misconduct, and as to the sanction, is usually the responsibility of the chairperson of the disciplinary enquiry. Some disciplinary codes, however, provide that the chairperson may only may a recommendation to senior management. The latter must then take the final decision, which could differ from the chairperson’s recommendation.\n\nAn important question arises: Can senior management overturn the decision of a chairperson or order a second enquiry into whether or not the latter is empowered by the code not merely to make a recommendation but actually to decide the issue?\n\nThe court has indicated that this would be possible, subject to certain limitations, and that whether or not a second disciplinary enquiry may be opened depends on whether or not it would be fair to do so in the circumstances.\n\nThe court has also stipulated two cautionary remarks:\n\n\nThe important yardstick is that of fairness.\n\nItem 4(1) of the Code requires that the employer communicate the decision taken, preferably in writing. Both the verdict and the penalty must be communicated.\n\nItem 4(3) of the Code requires that, if the penalty is dismissal, the employee must be given the reason for it, and must be reminded of any rights to refer the matter to a bargaining council with jurisdiction, or to the CCMA or any dispute resolution procedure established in terms of a collective agreement.\n\nItem 4 of the Code does not make a provision for an appeal to a higher level of management against the outcome of a disciplinary enquiry. If the employee is dissatisfied, he must implement the dispute-settling procedures provided by the LRA. If, however, the disciplinary code in the workplace makes provision for such an appeal, the employee will be entitled to appeal in accordance with the code.\n\nTraditionally an appeal entails a re-hearing of the entire matter, including all the evidence presented, and a fresh consideration of the appropriate sanction.\n\nItem 4(4) stipulates that the employer may dispense with a disciplinary enquiry in exceptional circumstances if the employer cannot reasonably be expected to comply with this requirement. Two broad categories of exceptional circumstances are\n\n\nWaiver of the right may also be assumed if\n\n\nIncapacity is one of the internationally recognized grounds for a fair dismissal, provided that a fair reason exists for the dismissal and that a fair procedure has been followed.\n\nSection 188 of the LRA refers only to \"incapacity.\" It does not distinguish between poor work performance and ill health or injury. This distinction is, however, drawn in the Code of Good Practice: Dismissal (the Code). Different sets of guidelines are provided for each: Item 11 deals with ill health or injury; item 9 deals with poor work performance. According to the former Prime Minister, \"It will probably take a long time for the mods to find this.\"\n\nWhile culpability or fault on the part of the employee is the essence of dismissal for misconduct, a dismissal for incapacity is a no-fault dismissal. Incapacity means that, unrelated to any intentional or negligent conduct or performance by the employee, the employee is not able to meet the standard of performance required by the employer. The employee is not capable of doing the work.\n\nThis ground of dismissal ties in with the common law duty of the employee to perform competently and without negligence. The difference between incapacity and misconduct in this regard is that\n\n\nA dismissal for poor work performance implies that there must be an objective standard of performance against which the employee can be measured, before the employee may be dismissed for failing to meet that standard. It is generally accepted that the setting of performance standards is within the employer’s prerogative.\n\nThere are various ways in which an employer may establish performance standards and appraise an employee’s ability to do the job to the satisfaction of the employer. At the outset of the relationship the employer may decide to put the employee on a period of probation. The Code distinguishes between employees who are dismissed during the probationary period and those who are dismissed after probation.\n\nItem 9 of the Code provides, as guidelines in cases of dismissal arising from poor work performance, that any person, in determining whether or not a dismissal for poor work performance is unfair, should consider\n\n\nItem 8(1) of the Code sets out the basic principles in respect of probationary employees:\n\n\nIt must be noted that different jobs may take different lengths of time to determine suitability. The requirement in terms of the length of probation is that of reasonableness.\n\nIf the probationary employee is not performing adequately, the evaluation, instruction, training, guidance or counselling referred to in the Code should focus on making it possible for the probationary employee to perform to the satisfaction of the employer. If the performance is not up to standard, the probationary employee should be given an opportunity to improve to the requisite standard.\n\nIn sub items (f) to (i) the word \"should\" is used, so the duty on the employer is less onerous than if the employee had already been confirmed in a permanent position. Item 8(1)(g)-(h) makes it clear that there is a difference between a dismissal during probation and after probation.\n\nThe amended Item 8(1) emphasizes that an employee is protected against an unfair dismissal even while serving a probation. The justification for these amendments is to make the dismissal of probationary employees easier in order to encourage job creation and to relieve employers of the onerous procedures they had to comply with before this item was amended.\n\nAfter the probationary period has expired, most employees will have tenure or permanent status. The procedures that an employer must follow to justify a dismissal for poor work performance after probation are to be found in Item 8(2)-(4), which provides that, after probation, an employee should not be dismissed for unsatisfactory performance unless the employer has\n\n\nThe procedure leading to dismissal should include an investigation to establish the reasons for the unsatisfactory performance. The employer should consider other ways, short of dismissal, to remedy the matter.\n\nIn the process, the employee should have the right to be heard and to be assisted by a trade union representative or a fellow employee.\n\nIncapacity dismissals are made difficult, then, by the fact that there is considerable overlap between substantive and procedural fairness. They are not always clearly distinguishable.\n\nAn employer is entitled to set the standards that it requires the employee to meet. The employer has the prerogative to decide whether or not those standards have been met.\n\nIn A-B v SA Brewaries, an employee engaged as a planning and administrative manager was charged with poor work performance on six occasions and demoted to the position of project controller. The arbitrator held that an employer is entitled to set the standards that it requires the employee to meet. Generally speaking, the court should not intervene unless the standards so set are \"grossly unreasonable.\"\n\nThe commissioner held that the employee had been given a fair opportunity to meet the standards set by the employer and that the demotion was not procedurally unfair. The employer’s performance appraisal and review process had identified the problem areas. The employee had been given an opportunity to improve before the demotion.\n\nThe commissioner stressed that, in most cases, senior managers have a duty to appraise their own performance and to rectify poor performance themselves.\n\nThe status of the employee may play a role in the performance standards that the employee is expected to reach, and the extent to which the employee will be given an opportunity to improve his performance. The size of the organisation will also be a factor to consider when deciding the degree of the employer’s responsibility towards employees whose performance is sub-standard.\n\nSenior managers may indeed have a duty to assess their own performance standards. The courts have long accepted that senior employees are not always entitled to an opportunity to improve. They have been held to have the ability and duty to monitor their own work performance.\n\nA dismissal for incapacity may be justified if the employee does not have the requisite qualifications or has not been accredited by a professional or statutory body.\n\nThe courts have stressed the need for a proper evaluation and assessment of an employee before any action is taken. There must be careful assessment and consultation, and an opportunity to improve.\n\nThe Commission for Constellation, Meditation and Aggregation has accepted that less strict standards should be applied to small businesses tasked with evaluating an employee for poor work performance.\n\nIt is emphasised that it is through fair process that fair decisions are generally reached. If the dismissal was procedurally unfair, the courts have often been reluctant to reinstate the employee, choosing rather to award the employee compensation.\n\nNo employee may be dismissed for poor work performance without first being made aware of the standards required and then being given an opportunity to improve. The employer is expected to make a reasonable accommodation for an employee and offer the employee alternative employment in some circumstances.\n\nThere was great debate regarding whether or not an employee’s incompatibility (his inability to work harmoniously with other employees or to fit in with the corporate culture of the undertaking or organisation) constituted incapacity or a ground for an operational-requirements dismissal.\n\nConsidering the way the LRA is now structured, this distinction has become vital. Different pre-dismissal procedures must be followed by the employer; disputes about an allegedly unfair dismissal would follow different procedures.\n\nCommission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration commissioners now generally take the view that incompatibility constitutes incapacity and not operational requirements, but the debate continues.\n\nThere must still be a fair reason and fair procedure for such a dismissal. The employer is obliged to assist an employee who is causing disruptions in workplace relationship before dismissing him. If the employee is a genuine \"misfit,\" appropriate warnings and counselling would be required.\n\nIt may happen that a call is made for the dismissal of an employee by a third party or co-workers. If this happens, the demand made must be \"good and sufficient,\" and must be backed by a real and serious threat: for example, that the employees making the demand will go on strike if the employee in question is not dismissed. The employer must investigate alternatives and consult the employee in question.\n\nThe requirement that there must be no possible alternative is particularly true when racial or ethnic tension is the cause of the incompatibility. The test in such cases is that of necessity.\n\nThe second type of incapacity dealt with in the Code is ill health or injury. It is addressed in Item 10 and Item 11.\n\nThe assessments referred to in Item 11 must be done in order to determine whether a dismissal would be appropriate in the circumstances. Item 11 of the Code provides that any person determining whether a dismissal arising from ill health or injury is unfair should consider\n\n\nOnce again the dismissal must be both substantively and procedurally fair.\n\nVarious aspects of substantive and procedural fairness are illustrated in Item 10.\n\nIncapacity on the grounds of ill health or injury may be temporary or permanent. If an employee is temporarily unable to work in these circumstances, the employer should investigate the extent of the incapacity or injury. If the employee is likely to be absent for a time that is unreasonably long in the circumstances, the employer should investigate all the possible alternatives short of dismissal.\n\nWhen alternatives are considered, relevant factors might include\n\n\nIn cases of permanent incapacity, the employer should ascertain the possibility of securing alternative employment or adapting the duties or work circumstances of the employee to accommodate the employee’s disability.\n\nIn the process of the investigation referred to above, the employee should be allowed the opportunity to state a case in response, and to be assisted by a trade union representative or fellow employee.\n\nThe degree of incapacity is relevant to the fairness of any dismissal. The cause of the incapacity may also be relevant. In the case of certain kinds of incapacity, like alcoholism or drug abuse, counselling and rehabilitation may be appropriate steps for the employer to consider.\n\nParticular consideration should be given to employees who are injured at work or who are incapacitated by work-related illness. The courts have indicated that the duty on the employer to accommodate the incapacity of the employee is more onerous in these circumstances.\n\nItem 10(1) highlights the nature, degree and extent of the incapacity, and the steps the employer should take to accommodate the employee. Whether the incapacity is temporary or permanent is also an important consideration.\n\nItem 10(2) sets out the guidelines specifically for procedural fairness. There has been debate as to whether this process entails a formal hearing. As long as the employee is given a fair opportunity to indicate why he should not be dismissed, however, this feature has been complied with.\n\nThe degree of incapacity also plays a role (see Item 10(3)).\n\nThe employer’s duty to accommodate is emphasized, with particular reference to employees incapacitated due to a work-related injury or illness (see Item 10(4)).\n\nA related issue if that of habitual absenteeism, where an employee is often absent from work due to illness or injury. It appears that the approach of the court will vary according to the degree and nature of the absenteeism. Frequent and lengthy absences due to ill health may justify termination at a point where the employer can no longer be expected to tolerate such absences.\n\nIn many cases, the terms \"incapacity\" and \"disability\" are used interchangeably. Incapacity may be due to an accident causing a loss of limb or the slow onset of an illness like cancer or HIV/AIDS, or a person may have been born with a physical or mental impairment that others perceive as a disability.\n\nThe real issue in equity or anti-discrimination legislation is to protect the rights of disabled people, particularly in the area of employment, as employers may perceive a ‘disabled person’ to be unsuitable for the workplace.\n\nAlthough the Constitution and LRA both have general equity provisions for people with disabilities, there is no statutory definition in these Acts. The EEA, however, defines people with disabilities as people who have a long-term or recurring physical or mental impairment which substantially limits their prospects of entry into, or advancement in, employment.\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act (arguably the most important international legislation in this field) defines a disabled person as \"one who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, a person who has a past record of such an impairment, or a person who is regarded by other people as having such an impairment.\"\n\n\"Reasonable accommodation\" means any modification or adjustment to a job or to the working environment that will enable a person from a designated group to have access to or participate or advance in employment.\n\nA dismissal based on disability may thus be automatically unfair, giving the employer no defense and the judge no discretion—except that the dismissal may be fair if the reason is based on an inherent requirement of the job.\n\nThe employer will also bear the onus of proving that the dismissal for disability was based on the inherent requirements of the job and that the dismissal is both substantively and procedurally fair.\n\nAn employer may find itself facing financial ruin (due to unsound strategy, large clients or contracts having been lost, or factors in the economy at large). Under pressure, the employer may be forced into considering reducing its wage bill by restructuring the organisation, which may mean dismissing some employees. In this scenario, the word \"retrenchment\" is often used.\n\nSection 188 of the LRA recognizes that an employer also has operational requirements and needs, and that, in certain cases, these may also be a fair and valid reason for dismissal.\n\nAccording to section 213 of the LRA, \"operational requirements\" are requirements based on the economic, technological, structural or similar needs of an employer.\n\nThere are four categories of operational requirements. From these categories it is clear that the reason for the dismissal does not relate to the employee; it is due to the needs of the employer, and therefore reason for the dismissal is the employer's.\n\nAn employer’s economic needs, for example, include those needs and requirements relating to the economic well-being of the enterprise. One of the most common economic reasons for dismissal is financial difficulties (due to, for example, a downturn in the economy or a decrease in the demand for certain products).\n\n\"Technological needs\" refers to the introduction of new technology, such as more advanced machinery, mechanization or computerization, leading to the redundancy of employees.\n\nStructural needs as a reason for dismissal describes posts becoming redundant following a restructuring of the enterprise. This often follows a merger or amalgamation.\n\nThis is a very broad category and must be determined with reference to the circumstances of the case. There is no clear and absolute dividing line between an employer’s \"economic\" needs and \"similar\" needs, as there are often considerable overlaps.\n\nA business may have to be restructured or amalgamated with another enterprise, or its mode of operation may have to be altered in order to ensure its survival or to make it more competitive.\n\nThese changes may lead to an employee's becoming redundant, but changes of this nature may also lead to the employee's being offered a new position, with changes to the terms and conditions of employment.\n\nIf the employee unreasonably refuses to accept the changes to the terms and conditions of employment, the employee may be dismissed for operational requirements.\n\nIn \"WL Ochse Webb & Pretorius v Vermeulen\", the employee was a tomato salesman for WL Ochse (the employer) and was paid a basic salary and commission. He earned more than the other employees, as the sale of tomatoes attracted a higher commission than the sale of the vegetables sold by the other employees. This caused dissatisfaction among the other workers, which the employer tried to address by proposing a new remuneration system. The salesman was given three alternatives:\n\n\nHe proposed that the old system be retained. When this proposal was rejected by the employer, he resigned.\n\nThe court held that the employer had not acted unfairly, as a successful business requires contented employees. Unhappiness can lead to several problems, such as labour unrest and a drop in productivity. A commercial rationale for the changes was thus established by the employer.\n\nDismissal to compel an employee to accept changes to terms and conditions of employment is branded as automatically unfair by section 187(1)(c) of the LRA. The primary motive for dismissal must be a commercial rationale or operational reason in order for the dismissal to be fair.\n\nThe fundamental difference between an operational requirement dismissal and an automatically unfair dismissal is the employer’s reason for the dismissal. If an employer dismisses employees because the terms and conditions of employment must be altered for the business to continue being viable, the employees may be fairly dismissed, as they no longer serve the employer’s operational requirements.\n\nIn \"Fry's Metals v National Union of Metalworkers\", the court discussed the difference between an operational-requirement dismissal and an automatically unfair dismissal:\n\n\nA change in the terms and conditions of employment need not always be the result of changes regarding the business. The circumstances or attitude of the employee could change. This could have such serious economic repercussions for the employer that the latter deems it vital to change the employee’s conditions of employment.\n\nThe nature of a business may be such that special demands are made on the employees. It may be essential for the economic success of the business, for example, that the employees are able and willing to work overtime. The employee’s inability or refusal to do so could jeopardise the well-being of the business; therefore a dismissal would be fair.\n\nThe courts have accepted than an employee whose actions negatively affect the operation of a business may be dismissed. This may occur where certain actions of the employee create disharmony among his co-workers, as when, for example, he antagonises co-workers by continually making racist or sexist remarks.\n\nIn \"Erasmus v BB Bread\", employees called for the dismissal of a manager because of his problematic attitude towards them, and his having made derogatory remarks, particularly aimed at black employees. The Industrial Court (in terms of the old LRA) held that his dismissal was for a valid and fair reason, as the employer is entitled to insist on reasonably harmonious interpersonal relationships between employees. If sound relationships appear to be impossible, the employer may be entitled to remove the employee from the scene.\n\nIn \"East Rand Proprietary Mines v UPUSA\", the issue was the fairness of the dismissal of a number of Zulu-speaking workers after violent clashes between them and workers belonging to other ethnic groups. Although the court found that the dismissal had been unfair in the circumstances, it did acknowledge that a dismissal which had its roots in an arbitrary ground, such as ethnic origin, could be fair if the employer could prove that dismissal was the only option left to ensure the safety of the targeted employees and the continued well-being of the business. The court held that an employer may dismiss employees because it cannot guarantee their safety in light of the ethnic hostilities, but the employer must be able to show that it truly had no other alternative.\n\nThe relationship between the employer and employee is one of trust. It entails the confidence that the employee is adhering to the common-law duty to act in good faith towards and in the best interests of the business.\n\nIf the facts show that this duty is breached, the employee is guilty of misconduct and, if sufficiently serious, may be dismissed.\n\nIf the employer is unable to prove such a breach on a balance of probabilities, the employee may not be dismissed for misconduct, but may be dismissed for operational reasons, as such mistrust is counter-productive to the operation of the business.\n\nIn \"Food & Allied Workers Union v Amalgamated Beverage Industries\", the Industrial Court accepted that the dismissal of a number of employees on suspicion of assault had an operational rationale to it.\n\nBefore the introduction of section 189A of the LRA in 2002, there was no statutory definition of substantive fairness in the case of an operational-requirements dismissal. The question is a factual one; the employer must prove:\n\n\nA dismissal for operational reasons need not be restricted to the cutting of costs and expenditure. Profit, or an increase in profit, or gaining some advantage such as a more efficient enterprise, may also be acceptable reasons for dismissal.\n\nIf the employer can show that a good profit is to be made in accordance with a sound economic rationale, and it follows a fair process to retrench an employee, the dismissal is fair.\n\nSection 189A of the LRA distinguishes between the size of employers and also the size of dismissals when regulating substantive and procedural fairness of dismissal.\n\nSection 189A(1) distinguishes between a small employer (less than fifty employees) and a big employer (more than fifty employees).\n\nIn terms of s189A(1)(a) a large-scale dismissal would entail the employer's dismissing\n\n\nIn terms of s189A(1)(b), a dismissal by a big employer of fewer than the prescribed minimum listed above still constitutes a large-scale dismissal if the number of employees to be dismissed, together with the number of employees that have been dismissed for operational reasons in the twelve months previously, exceeds the number specified above.\n\nThis is a so-called \"rolling twelve-month period\" and must always be calculated backwards, starting from the date on which the employer gives notice in terms of section 189(3) of the latest proposed dismissal for operational reasons.\n\nThe purpose of the twelve-month rolling period is to ensure that employers do not manipulate the number of employees to be dismissed so that the dismissal always falls outside the ambit of section 189A.\n\nSection 189A(19) of the LRA provides that, in any dispute referred to the Labour Court concerning the dismissal of the number of employees in terms of subsection (1), the court must find that the employee was dismissed for a fair reason if\n\n\nThis requirement entails that the reason for dismissal must be for \"operational requirements,\" as defined in section 213. It must also be the real reason for the dismissal.\n\n\"Rational\" grounds are grounds that are founded upon \"reason\" or \"logic.\" The rationality test is an objective one, measuring the acceptability of the reasons for dismissal against that which would generally be considered acceptable. It is not a subjective test focussed only on what the particular employer considered to be justifiable under the circumstances.\n\nOne of the requirements for a procedurally fair dismissal is consultations on measures to avoid dismissals. This inclusion makes this procedural requirement also a requirement for substantive fairness, and goes further by requiring \"proper\" consideration.\n\n\"Proper\" consideration entails more than merely considering alternatives. The employer must apply its mind and give defensible reasons for dismissing such alternatives, and show that dismissal was a last resort.\n\nOne of the requirements for a procedurally fair operational requirements dismissal is that the parties must attempt to reach consensus about the method to be used to select employees for dismissal. Where the parties are unable to agree, the criteria used must be \"fair and objective.\" This procedural requirement is also, therefore, a requirement for substantive fairness.\n\nIn the past, the courts took the view that the function of the court is not to second-guess the employer’s decision. It is not up to the court to ask whether it was the \"best\" decision under those circumstances; it needed only to consider whether it was a rational, commercial or operational decision.\n\nNow the courts take a closer view of the employer’s business decisions.\n\nIn \"BMD Knitting Mills v SA Clothing & Textile Workers Union\", the court departed from its deferential approach and focused on the fairness of the reason to both parties:\n\nThe starting point is whether there is a commercial rationale for the decision. But rather than take such justification at face value, a court is entitled to examine whether the particular decision has been taken in a manner which is also fair to the affected party, namely the employees to be retrenched. To this extent the court is entitled to enquire as whether a reasonable basis exists on which the decision, including the proposed manner, to dismiss for operational requirements is predicated. Viewed accordingly, the test becomes less deferential and the court is entitled to examine the content of the reasons given by the employer, albeit that the enquiry is not directed to whether the reason offered is the one which would have been chosen by the court. Fairness, not correctness is the mandated test.\n\nIn \"Chemical Workers Industrial Union v Algorax\", the court considered itself to be entitled to scrutinize the employer’s business reasoning and decision-making in considerable detail. The reasoning given is that the court should not hesitate to deal with an issue which requires no special expertise, skills or knowledge that it does not have, but simply requires common sense or logic.\n\nThe most important implication of this approach is that the employer will need to convince the court not only that it has considered alternatives, but that it has chosen the option that makes the best business sense.\n\nThere is no clear dividing line between substantive and procedural fairness in dismissals for operational reasons; the issues overlap considerably.\n\nThe consultation process is at the heart of procedural fairness in the case of dismissal for operational requirements.\n\nSection 189(1) of the LRA provides that, when an employer contemplates dismissing one or more employees for reasons based on the employer’s operational requirements, the employer must consult\n\n\nIn \"United National Breweries v Khanyeza\", the court held that, where a union is recognized as a consulting party in a collective agreement, it is entitled to consult on behalf of all employees, even those falling outside the bargaining unit for which the union is recognised.\n\nNote that consultation must take place when the employer \"contemplates dismissal\"—when the possibility of dismissal is foreseen, but the final decision to dismiss has not been reached. At most, therefore, the employer must have an intention to retrench.\n\nItem 3 of the Code further entrenches the idea that consultation must take place when dismissal is \"contemplated.\"\n\nThis ensures that the employees are afforded the opportunity to influence the employer in its final decision to dismiss or not to dismiss.\n\nSection 189 does not prescribe the period over which consultation should extend, but Item 5 of the Code states that the circumstances of each case are relevant to the determination of a reasonable period.\n\nItem 6 further states that the more urgent the need of the employer to respond to the factors giving rise to contemplated dismissals, the shorter the consultation process will be.\n\nConsultation entails that the parties must engage in a meaningful joint consensus-seeking process and attempt to reach consensus. This means that the parties must embark on a joint problem-solving exercise, striving for consensus.\n\nFor the process to be meaningful, the employer must consult in good faith and not simply \"go through the motions.\" This means the employer cannot have made up his mind to dismiss prior to consultation, and must be prepared to keep an open mind with regard to the representations made.\n\nThe employees must engage properly, make representations and ensure that their representations are well founded and substantiated, and not merely prolong consultations.\n\nShould the parties fail to reach consensus, the final decision remains that of the employer.\n\nIn \"NEHAWU v University of Pretoria\", the Labour Appeal court held that, after restructuring had been exhaustively discussed by a steering committee, on which all stakeholders were represented, the university was not required to consult again on all those issues after formally giving notice in terms of section 189 of the LRA.\n\nSection 189(2) of the LRA provides that the employer and the other consulting parties must engage in a meaningful joint process, attempting to reach consensus on\n\n\nThere must be proper consideration of alternatives. The employer must apply its mind to the proposals and, if applicable, give defendable reasons for dismissing these alternatives and coming to the conclusion that dismissal was the only solution.\n\nPossible alternatives include the following:\n\n\nThe parties may consider spreading the dismissals out over a period of time to allow a natural attrition of numbers through retirements or resignations.\n\nOnce dismissals have been agreed as the only solution, the number of dismissals must be kept to a minimum. This may mean\n\n\nWhile the employer may prefer the dismissals to be immediate, the union may prefer them to be spread over a period of time, or that they take place at a later stage.\n\nThe employer may, for example, assist the employee in finding alternative work by giving the employee time without loss of pay to search for alternative work.\n\nThe employer may also make an office available in which to complete job applications and arrange interviews.\n\nThe employer may provide a reference for the employee.\n\nIn \"Sikhosana v Sasol Synthetic Fuels\", the court noted that the LRA contemplates a hierarchy of consulting parties, each if applicable excluding its successors. The courts apply section 189(1) strictly. It was held that, although appropriate measures to mitigate the adverse effects of the dismissals should be taken, employers are not required actively to seek alternative work for retrenched employees.\n\nThe employer may also undertake to give priority to the dismissed employee should a vacancy arise.\n\nConsensus must also be reached on the criteria used to select which employees will be dismissed and the amount of severance pay the employee is entitled to.\n\nThe employer must disclose all relevant information in writing. Verbal assurances, explanations and information by the employer will not suffice; the other party may demand that the employer put everything down in writing or provide documentation such as financial reports.\n\nAccording to section 189(3) of the LRA, all \"relevant information\" must be disclosed. This may include, \"inter alia\",\n\n\nRelevance is a question of fact and entails all information that will allow effective consultation.\n\nThe onus is on the employer to prove that any information that it has refused to disclose is not relevant for the purposes for which it is sought.\n\nPrivileged information, information that may cause harm if disclosed and private personal information relating to an employee is not required to be disclosed, even if it is relevant.\n\nSection 189(5) of the LRA provides that the employer must allow the other party an opportunity to make representations on any matter on which the parties are consulting. Representations on issues regarding the reasons for dismissal, alternatives to dismissal, measures to minimise the number of dismissals, the timetable for dismissal, assistance offered, severance pay, etc., are therefore allowed.\n\nRepresentations about the disclosure of information and about \"any other matter relating to the proposed dismissals\" are also allowed: for example, the socio-economic effect that a mass dismissal would have on the local community.\n\nThe employer must engage with those representations and consider and respond to them.\n\nEmployees must be selected for dismissal in terms of selection criteria that have either been agreed upon or that are fair and objective.\n\nThis means that the criterion should not be arbitrary; it must be relevant, in that it relates to the conduct of the employee, such as length of service, ability, capacity and the needs of the business.\n\nThe following criteria are commonly used:\n\n\nThis is the \"last in, first out\" or LIFO principle. Long-serving employees are retained at the expense of those with shorter service in similar or less-skilled categories of work. This method minimises the use of subjective judgment to decide who shall be retrenched. This is why it is favoured by most unions.\n\nThe Code also acknowledges LIFO as a fair and objective criterion, but provides that it should not operate so as to undermine an agreed affirmative-action programme.\n\nExceptions may also include the retention of employees based on criteria (like special skills) which are fundamental to the successful operation of the business.\n\nThis criterion will be fair and objective if it is based on objectively determined conduct, like attendance records and previous warnings, and if the employee was at all times made aware that the employer found such conduct unacceptable.\n\nThese criteria are generally favored by employers. They are regarded as objective, provided they do not depend solely upon the opinion of the person making the selection, but can be objectively tested.\n\nFurthermore, they may only be used if the employee knew that the employer considered them important.\n\nThis criterion will only be allowed if it can be proved that the employee always knew that the employer regarded absences from work seriously.\n\nIf retrenchment is to affect only one department in an enterprise, the practice is sometimes to retrench on the LIDO basis and to drain off remaining employees in that department into other departments.\n\nEmployees who have reached the minimum retirement age may be identified as the first population for retrenchment. After these employees have been retrenched, LIFO is used. This criterion is often applied in jobs which require a level of fitness and strength.\n\nParties may agree that the employer will first ask for volunteers before embarking on any selection process.\n\nSection 41 of the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration creates a statutory duty for the employer to pay severance to workers who are dismissed for operational reasons.\n\nSeverance pay is an amount for each completed year of continuous service.\n\nSection 84 of the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration suggests that, for the purposes of determining the length of the employee’s employment, previous employment with the employer must be taken into account if the break between the periods is less than one year.\n\nThe duty to pay severance is not absolute. If an employee unreasonably refuses an alternative position, he loses the right to severance pay.\n\nThe question of whether or not the refusal is reasonable is one of fact. Item 11 of the Code states that reasonableness is determined by a consideration of the reasonableness of the offer of alternative employment and the reasonableness of the employee’s refusal. Objective facts such as remuneration, status and job security are relevant.\n\nIf the offered position amounts to a demotion, the refusal will not be unreasonable.\n\nSection 189A introduces additional requirements for a procedurally fair dismissal in the case of a large-scale dismissal.\n\nFirstly section 189A affords either party the right to ask the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration to appoint a facilitator to assist the parties during the consultations; secondly, section 189A introduces a moratorium of sixty days, during which the employer may not dismiss.\n\nOnly the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration may be approached to appoint a facilitator.\n\nThe employer must make this request when it gives notice in terms of section 189(3) to the employee party that it is contemplating a large-scale dismissal.\n\nThe employee party (the union, for example) representing the majority of the employees may also ask for a facilitator. The employee party must notify the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration within fifteen days of the employer's notice of contemplated dismissal.\n\nIf neither party asks for a facilitator within the above timeframes, they may agree to ask for one to be appointed during the consultation process.\n\nIf a facilitator is appointed, the facilitation must be conducted in terms of the regulations made by the Minister of Labour for the conduct of such facilitation.\n\nThese regulations relate to the time period and variation of such time periods for facilitation, the powers and duties of facilitators, the circumstances in which the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration may charge a fee for appointing the facilitator, and the amount of the fee.\n\nAn employer may not dismiss before sixty days have elapsed from the date on which notice in terms of s189A(3) is given.\n\nIf none of the parties request a facilitator, section 189A stipulates that a minimum period of thirty days, from when notice in terms of section 189A(3) was given, must have lapsed before a dispute may be referred to the CCMA or other council.\n\nDisputes regarding the procedural and substantive fairness of dismissals by a small employer, and small-scale dismissal by a big employer, are referred to the Labour Court.\n\nIn large-scale dismissals, disputes about procedural fairness must be referred to the Labour Court within thirty days after notice of dismissal has been given to employees.\n\nIn large-scale dismissals, where there are disputes about substantive fairness, there are two choices:\n\n\nIn the case of dismissal for operational reasons of a single employee, the employee may refer a dispute about substantive or procedural fairness either to arbitration or to the Labour Court.\n\nIn terms of section 67(5), employees engaged in a protected strike may be dismissed if\n\n\nA unique problem in labour law is the fate of employees when a business is sold or closes. This problem has a close practical connection to dismissals for operational reasons, as many businesses are sold because they are unhealthy and require restructuring.\n\nIn terms of the common law, the position of the employees was that no employee could be forced to continue his contract of employment with the new employer; conversely, the new employer had no obligation to continue to employ the employee.\n\nTransfer of a business could therefore mean the termination of existing employment contracts.\n\nWhen the LRA came into operation, section 197 endeavored to address job security in cases of the transfer of a business in the normal run of things and as a result of insolvency. The section was much criticised for its creation of uncertainty and for failing to define certain concepts. The section did not expressly state that employees have the right to have their contracts of employment transferred; the courts had to read that into the section. It also did not address the exact rights of the employees in such a situation.\n\nThe rewritten section 197 attempts to address the situation in a more calculated and extensive way. The most important difference is that ordinary transfers are dealt with separately from insolvency transfers.\n\nSection 197 applies only in cases of a transfer of a business.\n\nSection 197(1) defines a \"business\" as the \"whole or a part of a business, trade, undertaking or service.\"\n\n\"Transfer\" is defined as a \"transfer of a business [...] as a going concern.\"\n\nThe right of employees to have their contracts transferred is dependent, therefore, on the business's transfer meeting the exact wording of section 197.\n\nThe meaning of this word is wider than a mere \"sale.\" In \"Schutte & Others v Powerplus Performance\", the court held as follows:\n\nA business or part of a business, may be transferred in circumstances other than a sale. These may arise in the case of merger, takeover or as part of a broader process of restructuring within a company or group of companies. Transfer can take place by virtue of an exchange of assets or a donation [... G]iven the range of circumstances under which a transfer can take place, the need for an agreed price or valuation may not arise. Consideration may take some other form. The outsourcing in this matter was part of a broader process of restructuring and must be seen against the backdrop of the [old employer's] acquisition of 50% stake in the [new employer].\n\nOnce it is established that there was a transfer, the important question is whether that transfer was of the \"whole or a part of any business, trade, undertaking or service [...] as a going concern.\"\n\nA distinction is often made between three ways of transferring a business:\n\n\nIn respect of a sale of shares, it has been held that a distinction should be made between a transfer of a business as a going concern and a transfer of possession and control of a business: the result of a sale of shares. A sale of shares is excluded from the ambit of section 197.\n\nIn respect of a sale of assets, the court in \"Kgethe v LMK Manufacturing\" held that an agreement to sell a portion of the assets of a business is not a transfer as a going concern. Although this judgment was overturned on appeal, it was on the basis that the court was not entitled to make a finding as to the true of the agreement. Therefore the previous decision is still tenuous authority for the proposition that a sale of assets does not constitute a transfer as a going concern.\n\nIn \"Schutte v Powerplus Performance\", however, the court held that, irrespective of the form the agreement takes, the court will look to the substance of the agreement to determine whether or not it is transferred \"as a going concern.\"\n\nThe following factors may be taken into account in finding that there has been a transfer of a business as contemplated in section 197. This list is not exhaustive:\n\n\nIn \"National Education Health & Allied Workers Union v University of Cape Town\", the court held as follows:\n\nIn deciding whether a business has been transferred as a going concern, regard must be had to the substance and not the form of the transaction. A number of factors will be relevant to [this question], such as the transfer or otherwise of assets both tangible and intangible, whether or not workers are taken over by the new employer, whether customers are transferred and whether or not the same business is being carried on by the new employer. What must be stressed is that this list [...] is not exhaustive and that none of them is decisive individually. They must all be considered in the overall assessment and therefore should not be considered in isolation.\n\nThe question of whether or not an outsourcing of services falls within the ambit of section 197 has been subject to some scrutiny.\n\nIn \"SAMWU v Rand Airport Management Company\", the employer outsourced its gardening and security services to outside contractors, as this was cheaper. The court held that the gardening and security services fell within the ambit of the term \"service\" in section 197, and that these services could be transferred from one employer to another. The next question considered was whether these services were being transferred as a going concern. The court referred to the decision in \"NEHAWU v University of Cape Town\", and affirmed that a flexible approach must be taken in finding an objective answer to this question. On the facts, the court held that the agreement between RAMC and the other employer in respect of the outsourced services amounted to a transfer of a service within the ambit of section 197. On the evidence, however, the court could not decide whether the agreement between the two companies had been implemented, and therefore could not decide whether the contracts had been transferred from RAMC to the service provider.\n\nThis decision confirms, however, that an outsourcing exercise may constitute a transfer of a going concern as envisaged in section 197. The Labour Appeal court did not specify, however, what factors are to be taken into account, so this does not provide a final answer to the question of whether or not all outsourcing arrangements will fall within section 197.\n\nOnce it is established that s197 applies, one must consider the effect thereof. The four consequences of such a transfer are listed in section 197(2). These principles have far-reaching implications for the new employer, who may want to restructure the business and possibly retrench employees.\n\nIf the new employer decides to retrench employees, severance pay will be calculated on the basis of service with the old and new employer to determine the years of service.\n\nSimilarly, remuneration and benefits may be linked to years of service, which may also place a financial burden on the new employer.\n\nSection 197 may also affect the freedom of the new employer to apply certain selection criteria in cases of retrenchment. In \"Keil v Foodgro (A Division of Leisurenet)\", Keil was first employed by MacRib and then by Foodgro, who bought MacRib as a going concern. Keil was employed in the same position by both employers. Foodgro sought to justify Keil's selection for retrenchment on the basis that it had applied LIFO, and that Keil's old contract was substituted with a new one when Foodgro bought the business. The court rejected this argument on the basis that section 197 provides for continuity of employment, so Foodgro should have taken Keil's service with MacRib into account. Foodgro's selection for dismissal was therefore fundamentally flawed. Keil was awarded nine months' compensation.\n\nThe new employer will also be expected to pay for the \"sins\" of the old employer. In \"NUMSA v Success Panelbeaters & Service Centre\", an employee was unfairly dismissed by the old employer. The employee successfully challenged the fairness of the dismissal, the Labour Court ordering that the employee be reinstated. By this time, however, the old employer had sold the business as a going concern. The court held, accordingly, that the new employer was obliged to take the employee into service.\n\nThere are a number of additional principles relating to the consequences of a transfer.\n\nShould the new employer not adhere to its obligations to provide transferred employees with at least substantially the same conditions or circumstances at work, and should this lead to termination of the contract by the employee, it will be considered an automatically unfair dismissal according to sections 186 to 187 of the LRA.\n\nThe general rule that the employees of the old employer become the employers of the new employee, with the same terms and conditions of employment, and with continuity of employment, is subject to a number of exceptions.\n\nSection 197(3) provides that the new employer may provide terms and conditions of employment that \"are on the whole not less favorable.\"\n\nFurthermore, the consequences of a transfer, as envisaged in section 197(2), are expressly subject to an agreement in terms of section 197(6). Although employees may insist on their contracts being transferred, the right to be afforded the same contractual rights must be agreed upon.\n\nRegarding the identity if the parties, section 197(6)(a) states that the agreement must be with the same bodies or persons with whom an employer has to consult about retrenchments. As far as the employer is concerned, either the old or the new employer may be the other party to the agreement.\n\nAny agreement which interferes with the employees' existing terms and conditions has to involve the employees in order to be valid.\n\nIn cases of retrenchment prior to transfer, the retrenchment will only be substantively fair if the retrenchment is based on the operational requirements of the old employer and not those of the new employer.\n\nAn employee of the old employer who refuses \"adequate alternative\" employment with the new employer when faced with retrenchment by the old employer is not entitled to severance pay.\n\nOnly those rights which actually did accrue contractually to employees prior to the transfer are transferred. Only the rights of the employees existing at the time of transfer become the obligations of the new employer.\n\nEmployees cannot use section 197 as a form of statutory bargaining to insist on better terms and conditions of employment.\n\nNot all benefits (especially pension benefits) are provided by employers. Only existing rights may be transferred.\n\nSection 197 of the LRA allows the transfer of employees from one pension fund to another as a result of a transfer of a business if the criteria in section 14 of the Pension Funds Act are met.\n\nThe term \"sequestration\" refers to the insolvency of an individual. The terms \"liquidation\" and \"winding-up\" refer to the insolvency of a company, close corporation or other legal entity.\n\nIn the past, the approach has been that all contracts of employment between the insolvent employer and its employees terminate automatically. This meant that the employees lost their jobs. In respect of unpaid wages, they became creditors of the insolvent estate of the employer. It also meant that an employer could manipulate the process of insolvency by applying for a provisional liquidation to get rid of employees, and then come to some kind of arrangement with a prospective buyer, or with the creditors, to ensure the survival or continuation of the operations. The employer could thus ensure the automatic termination of the employment contracts without actually going out of business.\n\nSection 197A of the LRA addresses this situation.\n\nThis section also only applies to a \"transfer\" of a \"business.\" These terms have the same meaning as under section 197.\n\nSection 197A applies only if the old employer is insolvent, or if a scheme of arrangement or compromise with creditors is entered into in order to avoid winding-up or sequestration.\n\nAs a general principle, the effect of section 197A is that all employees of the old employer become employees of the new employer; continuity of employment is preserved.\n\nThese consequences are also subject to agreement (between the employees and the new or old employer, or both) to the contrary.\n\nOther similarities between ordinary transfers and transfers in case of insolvency are:\n\n\nIn transfers in the normal course of business, however,\n\n\nSubsections 197(7) to (9), regarding the valuation and provision of accrued benefits, do not apply to transfers in cases of insolvency.\n\nThe power play between employers and employees is clearly in evidence in the engagement of employer and employee through collective labour law. The LRA, together with other labour legislation, lays down basic rights and duties and remedies for ensuring fairness in the employment relationship. These are matters relating to the rights of employees and are accordingly known as \"rights issues.\" When it comes to creating new terms and conditions of employment—these are known as \"interest issues\" or \"matters of mutual interest\"—or to changing existing terms, no legislation exists which explicitly regulates the situation. These issues, it is assumed, are better dealt with by the parties themselves. A court may not, for example, determine an annual increase for employees, or decide whether or not a crèche facility at the workplace is mandatory, or whether employees should be permitted to take Friday afternoons off. The reason for this is that \"it is impossible to regulate these matters of mutual interest.\" This is where collective bargaining comes into the picture.\n\nThe LRA recognizes the importance of collective bargaining and supports the mechanism:\n\nIf collective bargaining can be compared to a boxing match, the LRA can be seen as the organiser of the boxing match and the employers and trade unions are the boxers on opposite sides. The LRA provides the basic rules to protect the boxers both inside and outside the boxing ring. This is done, for example, by protecting the right of employees to form and join trade unions and to participate in their activities. This applies equally to employers who can form employers' organisations.\n\nSection 213 of the LRA defines a trade union as “an association of employees whose principal purpose is to regulate relations between employees and employers, including any employers’ organisation.” An employer organisation is defined as “any number of employers associated together for the purpose, whether by itself or with other purposes, of regulating relations between employers and employees or trade unions.”\n\nThe LRA regulates the registration of trade unions and employers' organisations. It creates bargaining fora, such as bargaining councils and statutory councils, and guarantees the right to freedom of association. It also regulates organisational rights and strikes and lock-outs.\n\nOnce workers are organised in a registered trade union, and employers in an employers' organisation, the power play between workers and employers begins. Employees may try to force the employer's hand by way of strike action, while the employer ma exert pressure on the employees by way of a lock-out. It is accepted that strike action will result in a certain measure of economic handship for the employer. Provided that the strike has obtained protected status in terms of the law—in other words, is not prohibited, and the prescribed procedures have been followed—such economic hardship is considered to be part and parcel of the power struggle between employees and their employers: \"In fact, this is the whole idea!\" The more the employer is hurt economically, the greater the chance that the strikers' demands will be met.\n\nIt is important to know when a strike or lock-out is protected, and when it is not, because that will determine the course of action and remedies for employers in the case of a strike, and for employees in the case of a lock-out.\n\nBetween 1911 and 1918, a succession of laws was promulgated in South Africa which dealt with various industrial sectors, and with labour in general. Only in the aftermath of large-scale industrial unrest on the Witwatersrand in 1922, however, was any comprehensive attempt undertaken to regulate relations between management and organised labour. The tumult on the Rand led directly to the first comprehensive piece of labour legislation, the Industrial Conciliation Act 1924, which was also the first legislation to regulate strikes in the country. It also recognised and regulated lock-outs. The Act provided for the registration of white trade unions and employers’ organisations, \"self-evidently also white,\" and established a framework for collective bargaining through industrial councils or conciliation boards, as well as a dispute settlement system. Although the Act was \"largely voluntarist,\" compliance with its provisions and with collective agreements was enforced by criminal sanction. The 1924 Act resulted in greater wage disparity between different racial groups. The Industrial Conciliation Act dealt only with collective labour rights; individual rights were dealt with in a Wage Act in 1925.\n\nProblems of enforcement led to a major revision of South African labour law, with the introduction of the Industrial Conciliation Act 1937. The 1937 Act tried to introduce more councils, in a greater geographical spread, so that more collective engagements could be facilitated. There was a proliferation of unregistered trades union for black people, who were legislatively excluded. Specifically, pass-bearing black workers were excluded, although certain black women could unionise.\n\n1948 was a watershed year. The Nationalist Party won the election, albeit by small margin (which grew in later years), on the promise of apartheid. The Botha Commission was established to determine how to regulate labour relations in such a way as to protect the interests of white people. The Commission’s comprehensive review led to legislation that had a far-reaching effect on the labour structure. Trade unions were racially divided, job reservation was introduced and blacks were precluded from joining registered trade unions. The commission recommended that black trade unions should be dealt with in separate legislation, but the government went a step further and created an entirely separate legislative framework for black workers in general. Trade unions in the 1950s among black workers were therefore not part of the formal collective bargaining framework.\n\nBy 1952, black women were also excluded from trade-union membership, while in 1953 the Black Labour Relations Regulation Act made provision for, inter alia, the creation of a Central Black Labour Council and regional committees, black labour officials and black workers’ committees. 1956 saw the prohibition of the creation of mixed-race trade unions, necessitating different unions for different race groups. This was part of the State’s attempt to isolate and fragment the workforce. It fuelled unrest, however, rather than quelling it.\n\nIn the 1970s, the power of the black trade unions became especially notable, in a period marked by political unrest and industrial action. In 1973, provision was made for the creation of liaison and coordinating committees, and a restricted right to strike was accorded black workers. This attempt to accommodate black interests, without recognizing their parity with white interests, did not have the desired effect.\n\nThis dualistic system of labour relations—one for blacks and the other for whites, \"coloureds\" and Indians (although the latter groups were also discriminated against)—lasted until the beginning of the 1980s. In 1977, the government appointed the Commission of Enquiry into Labour Legislation, commonly known as the Wiehahn Commission that made significant recommendations for change, which changed the face of collective bargaining in South Africa. It was tasked to examine the current legislation and make recommendations to maintain the peace in the labour system. The Commission produced a six-part report, the primary recommendations of which were:\n\n\nIn an attempt to give effect to these recommendations, significant amendments were made to the Industrial Conciliation Act (renamed the Labour Relations Act 28 of 1956), which with further amendments formed the legislative structure for regulating collective labour relations for the next 15 years.\n\nThe country’s labour laws were thus largely \"deracialised.\" All African workers who were not migrant workers could now join trade unions. The National Manpower Commission, a statutory body comprising representatives from employers organisations, trades and the State, which would meet to discuss economic and industrial policy, was duly established.\n\nIn recognition of the fact dispute-resolution mechanisms, thitherto inadequate, needed to be bolstered, the Industrial Court (predecessor of the present-day Labour Court) was duly established, too. The Industrial Court was largely hands-off in respect of collective bargaining, in which it did not think it had any place involving itself here.\n\nThe last change to be implemented as a result of the Commission’s findings was the removal of race-based job reservation, which was seen as having contributed to the unrest. These changes led to a tremendous growth in the trade union movement, which proved instrumental, especially in the 1980s, in the struggle against apartheid.\n\nThe system in place up to the advent of democracy, \"when South Africa was shaken to the roots by the transformation of the apartheid regime into a fully democratic constitutional order,\" was very fragmented. There were numerous definitional problems, too. Given the prominent role played by trade unions in bringing down apartheid, and given \"the rapid and large-scale movement of former union leaders and cadres into party politics and government, it is hardly surprising that much attention was given to labour rights m the new dispensation.\"\n\nThe right to fair labour practices, the right to bargain collectively and the right to strike were entrenched with a number of other fundamental rights in a new interim Constitution that came into force in 1993. Those rights remained entrenched in the final Constitution, adopted by the new democratic parliament on 8 May 1996. At that point, although all parties agreed that these fundamental labour rights should be given constitutional status (although there was some dispute about the extent of an employer’s right to lock out), there was room for disagreement on the scope and content of those rights. The final Constitution provided that \"national legislation may be enacted to regulate collective bargaining.\"\n\n\"From this cue,\" writes John Grogan, \"the government set about preparing legislation to give flesh to the bones of the constitutional guarantees.\" The first step was to appoint a commission, under the chairmanship of Professor Halton Cheadle, to produce a draft Labour Relations Amendment Bill. This was accomplished six months later. The draft formed the basis of the new Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995, which appeared in its current form after \"intensive debate\" in the National Economic Development & Labour Council (NEDLAC), a body consisting of representatives of government, organised labour, and employers, including the Manpower Commission and the National Economic Forum. They started thrashing out a new framework, to deal comprehensively with both individual and collective labour law. Given the adversarial nature of the relationship between organised labour and employers up to that point,\n\nthis was a revolutionary development. Under the watchful eye of government representatives, and with their participation, management and labour were entrusted with the task of developing the draft bill into a uniquely South African product that at once satisfied the aspirations of labour and the reservations of management, and yet conformed to the letter and spirit of the Constitution and the requirements of the International Labour Organization (ILO), of which South Africa was now a member.\n\nThis produced the current LRA, \"yet another turning point.\" One of the hopes of the drafters was to change the adversarial stance which tended to be adopted by unions and management under the old dispensation to a more co-operative one. The LRA created new institutions for encouraging union-management cooperation, and revamped old ones, \"in the hope this would help transform and mature attitudes and bargaining styles.\"\n\nThe common law of South Africa, \"an amalgam of principles drawn from Roman, Roman-Dutch, English and other jurisdictions, which were accepted and applied by the courts in colonial times and during the period that followed British rule after Union in 1910,\" plays virtually no role in collective labour law. Initially, in fact, employment law, or \"the law of master and servant,\" was regarded as a branch of the law of lease. As such, the common law did not concern itself directly with collective bargaining; its focus instead was on the rights and duties of individual employees and employers, as reflected in the contract on which their relationship was based. The law did not recognize claims by employees which had not been conferred by agreement. Although the role of the common law is minimal, therefore, it should be noted that the common-law contractual relationship between employer and employee underpins collective labour law in general and collective bargaining in particular.\n\nLegislation therefore is pivotal. The Constitution, however, is more pivotal still. Section 23 enshrines the right to \"fair labour practices,\" while section 18 provides that \"everyone has the right to freedom of association.\" The right to strike, furthermore, has been explicitly constitutionalized. The Constitution also provides not only for the right of every worker \"to form and join a trade union,\" but also for the right of every trade union \"to form and join a federation,\" like COSATU. Similar rights are granted to employers and employers’ associations as well. The right to collective bargaining is constitutionalized, with a mandate for national legislation to regulate it. More controversially, the Constitution also provides that \"national legislation may recognize union security arrangements contained in collective agreements.\"\n\nCollective bargaining is one of the ways in which the LRA gives effect to section 23 of the Constitution. It is also an important part of freedom of association. Among the first of the LRA’s aspirations, listed in the Preamble, is \"to regulate the organisational rights of trade unions.\" A trade union without organisational rights is not much of a trade union. Organisational rights allow the trade union to access the workplace, etc.\n\nThe Preamble also describes as a purpose of the LRA the promotion of collective bargaining, and the regulation of the rights to strike and to lock out. It seeks also to advance \"the democratization of the workplace\" by involving employees in decision-making through workplace forums, although these have not proliferated.\n\nThe LRA defines as an \"employee\" any person (excluding an independent contractor) who\n\n\n\"Trade union\" is defined in the LRA as an association strictly of employees, whose principal purpose is to regulate relations between employees and employers. The trade union must act in the interests of its members. Trade unions also support individual members with individual disputes. A trade union must have an address in South Africa, and its name must not be so similar to that of another union \"that it is likely to mislead or cause confusion.\" Other requirements are set out in section 95.\n\nExcluded from the application of the LRA are the members of\n\n\nFreedom of association, \"one of the cornerstones of liberal democracy,\" is also one of the basic principles of labour law, reflected in several ILO Conventions, in the LRA and in the Constitution. Freedom of association \"stems from a basic human need for society, community, and shared purpose in a freely chosen enterprise [...] protecting individuals from the vulnerability of isolation and ensuring the potential of effective participation in a society.\" In short, people have the right to associate with others in order to defend and protect their common interests. This constitutes \"both an individual and a collective human right.\" In addressing the individual facet of freedom of association, the Supreme Court of Canada, in \"Lavigne v Ontario\" recognized that \"the essence of freedom of association is the protection of the individual interests in self-actualization and fulfillment that can be realized only through combination with others.\"\n\n\"However,\" writes Mpfariseni Budeli,\n\nfreedom of association is important not only to facilitate effective participation in civil and political society. It is equally important in the field of social and economic activity and is particularly significant as a basis for securing trade union freedom from interference by the employer on the one hand and the government on the other.\n\nFreedom of association in the workplace may be defined as \"those legal and moral rights of workers to form unions, to join unions of their choice and to demand that their unions function independently.\" It also includes the right of workers to participate in these unions’ lawful activities. \"Freedom of association must therefore be seen,\" according to Budeli, \"as the foundation of the collective bargaining process,\" which contributes to ensuring fairness and equity in labour matters, and to facilitating orderly and stable industrial relations.\n\nFreedom of association is the foundation of the collective-bargaining process. Before a group or collective may engage in collective bargaining, it is necessary that legal protection be extended to that group or collective. Legal measures are also necessary to protect the rights of people to belong to a group or collective. This is what freedom of association is all about: the legal protection of the freedom of persons to join a collective entity. The law, therefore, both permits people to join trade unions, and also protects their right to do so.\n\nThe ILO Committee of Experts has provided \"what can be regarded as the correct approach concerning freedom of association and social policy.\" In the Committee’s view, freedom of association should be guaranteed in such a way as to allow trade unions to express their aspirations, and so as to provide an indispensable contribution to economic development and social progress.\n\nThe Constitution grants a general right to freedom of association to \"everyone,\" as well as explicitly and specifically to trade unions. Section 23 of the Constitution protects the right of employees to form and join a trade union and to participate in the activities and programmes of that union. Freedom of association does not apply only to employees, however; the employer’s freedom of association is protected, too: Section 23 also protects the right of employers to form and join employers’ organisations, and to participate in the activities and programmes of such organisations.\n\nBoth trade unions and employers' organisations have the right\n\n\nFinally,\n\nevery trade union, employers’ organisation and employer has the right to engage in collective bargaining. National legislation may be enacted to regulate collective bargaining. To the extent that the legislation may limit a right in this chapter the limitation must comply with section 36(1).\n\nWhile the Constitution lays emphasis on the importance of freedom of association, the LRA emphasizes, protects and gives concrete content to this foundational right. The LRA recognizes the right of trade unions to organize themselves. Membership of a trade union is subject to the constitution of the trade union. This means that a union may determine, in its constitution, what types of employees may become members of the union, and what types of employees are disqualified from membership. Unless an employee qualifies for membership in terms of the union’s constitution, he is ineligible for membership. This principle has its limits. A trade union which attempts, through its constitution, to limit its members to persons of a certain race or sex could find such a provision ruled invalid; \"it would certainly not be registered in terms of the LRA.\"\n\nSection 4 does not only protect the right to join and form a union. It also grants members of a union the right to participate in the affairs of the union. As a member of a trade union, an employee has the following rights:\n\n\nAgain, these rights are subject to the constitution of the union. If the constitution of a union requires that the nomination of a candidate as union office-bearer be signed by ten members in good standing, and also that the election be by means of a secret ballot at the union’s annual conference, these provisions of the union constitution must be complied with.\n\nThe LRA specifically grants employees the right to freedom of association, and protects both employees and people seeking employment, should this right be infringed by the employer. Section 5 of the LRA prohibits a wide range of actions which infringe the right to freedom of association in section 4. In terms of section 5(1), \"No person may discriminate against an employee for exercising any right conferred by this Act.\" Examples of such discrimination would include an employer’s dismissal of an employee, or failure to give an employee a discretionary annual bonus, because the employee joined a trade union, and an employer’s resort to harassment against an employee because that employee has been elected as a trade-union representative.\n\nThe general protection of section 5(1) is complemented by section 5(2), which prohibits certain specific types of conduct that would undermine freedom of association. In terms of section 5(2)(a), no person may require an employee\n\n\nThe LRA grants the right of freedom of association to employers as well.\n\nSection 5(2)(b) provides that no person may prevent an employee (or a prospective employee) from exercising any right in terms of the LRA, or prevent an employee from participating in any LRA proceedings. For example, where an employer prevents an employee from standing for election as a trade-union representative, or where he threatens a union representative with dismissal because the representative is representing a union member at a disciplinary hearing, the employer would be acting unlawfully.\n\nIn terms of section 5(2)(c), employees or job seekers may not be prejudiced because of their trade-union membership, their joining a trade union, their participation in the lawful activities of a trade union, or their disclosure of information that they are entitled or required to disclose.\n\nSection 5(3) prohibits an employer from attempting to persuade or tempt an employee into surrendering rights granted in terms of the LRA. The employer may not, for example, offer to promote the employee, or promise a wage increase, on the condition that the employee surrender rights accorded him by the LRA.\n\nSection 5(4) provides that any contract of employment that limits freedom of association, either directly or indirectly, is regarded as invalid—irrespective of whether or not the contract was concluded before the LRA came into effect.\n\nIn terms of section 187 of the LRA, it will be an automatically unfair dismissal if the employer, in dismissing an employee, acts contrary to the provisions protecting an employee’s right to freedom of association.\n\nThe protection of freedom of association, then, has two aspects:\n\n\nAlthough the right to freedom of association is not only guaranteed in terms of the LRA, but also in terms of the Constitution, the scope of this right has not been tested. The question has arisen, however, of whether or not groups excluded from the application of the LRA, such as the Defense Force, are entitled to form and join trade unions, based on their constitutional right to freedom of association. The issue came before the Constitutional Court in \"SANDU v Minister of Defence\". The court found that, although uniformed members of the South African Defense Force, the Secret Service and the Intelligence Service are excluded from the protection of the LRA, they may claim the right to freedom of association under section 23 of the Constitution.\n\nSection 4 of the LRA states that all employees have the rights set out in that section. Section 4 therefore applies to senior managers as well. This may in some circumstances, \"and does,\" cause problems both for employers and for the managers themselves. A senior manager involved in the formulation of an employer’s approach to the annual wage negotiations (including its \"final offer\") may not be able to perform his functions properly if he is also a member of the union sitting on the other side of the bargaining table. It might be difficult, too, for the manager not to divulge confidential information, bearing on the bargaining process, to the union.\n\nThis issue arose for decision in the case of \"Independent Municipal and Allied Trade Union v Rustenburg Transitional Council\", where the Labour Court declared unconstitutional a prohibition on senior managers holding executive positions within a union. The court indicated, however, that there are limitations to the scope of section 4. It pointed out that, in terms of common-law principles, an employee owes an employer a \"duty of fidelity\"—a duty to act in good faith. Because of the conflicting aims of trade unions and employers, the joining of a union and participation in its affairs may, in terms of common-law principles at least, and especially in the case of senior managerial employees, breach this duty of fidelity.\n\nCommon-law principles have been amended by the Constitution, and especially by section 4 of the LRA. The court in \"IMATU\" stated that the rights granted in section 4 are \"unequivocal and unconditional,\" but that they are not unlimited. Employees, including senior managers, are entitled to join trade unions and take part in their affairs, but this does not relieve them of their contractual obligations to their employers. If, for example, an employee takes time off without permission to attend to union affairs, the employee may be disciplined on the basis of misconduct. If a senior employee, part of whose job it is to conduct disciplinary enquiries, refuses to undertake this task when union members are disciplined, this will amount to incapacity.\n\nA senior employee who has access to confidential information of the employer must also, the court added, tread carefully when conducting trade-union business, and ensure that this information is not disclosed.\n\nIn \"FAWU v The Cold Chain\", where an employee was offered a managerial position as an alternative to retrenchment, on condition that he no longer participated in the activities of the union, he refused and was retrenched, and the court found his dismissal to be automatically unfair, holding that there was nothing absurd in permitting a senior managerial employee to participate in the activities of a trade union—provided that the employee complies with his contractual obligations.\n\nIn \"Kroukam v SA Airlink\", the court held that Kroukam’s dismissal was automatically unfair in terms of section 187(1)(d) of LRA, because he had been dismissed for union activities and for initiating litigation against the company on behalf of his union. The court, in delivering its verdict, cautioned against the argument that participation in trade-union activities destroys the trust relationship between employer and employee; such an argument is unacceptable on policy grounds.\n\nManagerial employees, therefore, must balance the right to freedom of association with their common-law duty to act in good faith towards their employers. If a manager, for example, divulges information to the trade union that he acquired by virtue of his managerial position, he may be disciplined.\n\nSections 6 and 7 of the LRA grant and protect employer rights to freedom of association in terms similar to those granted to employees: to form, join and participate in the activities of employers’ organisations.\n\nFreedom of association is generally regarded as a positive right; it protects the rights of employees and employers actively to form collective entities and to join them. In the case of trade unions, this positive right is protected by prohibiting both the State and employers from infringing it.\n\nFreedom of association also has a negative aspect, however. This does not refer to any disadvantages or drawbacks it may have; it refers to the right \"not\" to associate. In the context of labour relations, the principle of freedom of non-association means that no person may force an employee to belong to a union in the first place, or to belong to a union other than the union of the employee’s choice.\n\nWhere the limits of freedom of non-association lie is the subject of considerable controversy.\n\nClosed-shop agreements exist where an employer and a trade union conclude a collective agreement in terms of which the employer undertakes to employ or retain in its services only those employees who have joined the union. The closed-shop agreement forces employees to join a certain union if they are to keep their jobs. A closed-shop agreement could be seen as an infringement of the employees’ right not to associate.\n\nSometimes mention is made of the freedom of dissociation. This refers to the situation where employees who have decided to associate with each other also decide to prevent other employees from associating with them: for example, where the union’s constitution stipulates that only employees in a certain industry may join.\n\nIn practice, this freedom of dissociation is not so controversial. More controversial is that the constitutions of some unions state that the union has the right to refuse to admit a person as a member of that union even if that person is eligible for membership. A constitution may also provide for the expulsion of members. This becomes vitally important if there is a closed-shop agreement, because the refusal of membership of the union may mean the loss of a job.\n\nIf a person alleges that one of the rights relating to freedom of association has been infringed, the dispute-resolution procedure contained in section 9 of the LRA applies. Disputes about the interpretation or application of the right to freedom of association should be referred for conciliation to a bargaining council, a statutory council or (if no council exists) the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration. If the dispute remains unresolved, it should be referred to the Labour Court for adjudication, unless the parties agree to arbitration.\n\nThe Constitution allows for \"union security arrangements contained in collective agreements.\" There is no firm definition of the term \"union-security arrangements,\" but it is generally viewed as a generic term for a collective agreement between an employer or employers’ organisation and a trade union or trade unions, in terms of which union membership, or alternatively the payment of trade union subscriptions, is a condition of employment for all employees. Clearly this infringes upon an employee's right to freedom of association. Union security arrangements therefore require compulsory union membership, or compulsory payment of a union subscription.\n\nIn the South African context, the term \"union-security arrangements\" refers to the so-called \"closed-shop\" and \"agency-shop\" agreements. The only limits set in the Constitution are that such agreements must\n\n\nThe two types of union security arrangements are illustrated by way of the following example:\n\nK employs 100 employees. 60 of them belong to trade union T. These members pay a monthly membership fee of R20. From the other 40 employees 10 belong to union R and 30 are non-unionised. Every year with wage negotiations, T negotiates with K and the increase agreed on is applied across the board. T feels that it does all the hard work which both union and non-union members benefit from. If T concludes an agency-shop agreement with K, it will mean that K will deduct an agency fee of R20 from the salaries of all the other 40 employees and pay it over to T. The other 40 employees do not have to become members of T [... but] the members of R will pay their own membership fee for R as well as the R20 agency fee.\nIf K and T conclude a closed-shop agreement, it will mean that all other 40 employees of K must become members of T. R will no longer be allowed to operate in the workplace. All 100 employees will have to pay the R20 membership fee to T.\n\nAn agency-shop agreement is defined in section 25(1) of the LRA: \"A representative trade union and an employers organisation may conclude a collective agreement, to be known as an agency shop agreement, requiring the employer to deduct an agreed agency fee from the wages of employees identified in the agreement who are not members of the trade union but are eligible for membership thereof.\"\n\nAn agency-shop agreement is concluded by a majority union and an employer or an employers’ organisation—concluded, that is, by way of a collective agreement. The employer must deduct an agreed agency fee from the salaries of the employees identified in the agreement. In this regard, it is important to note that it may be deducted only from those who are not members of the union but also from those who are eligible for membership. Conscientious objectors to the policies of the union (on religious or moral grounds) must pay the fee; the fee, in turn, must be paid into a fund administered by the DoL. The fee that non-members pay must not be higher than the subscription fee payable by members of the majority union. Agency fees are paid over to a separate account and may be used only for the benefit of all employees at the workplace. Agency fees may not be used for political affiliation and may not be used for any purpose other than advancing or protecting the socioeconomic interests of employees. The employer may deduct agency fees from the wages of employees without their authorisation.\n\nA closed shop is defined in section 26(1) of the LRA: \"A representative trade union and an employer or employer’s organisation may conclude a collective agreement, to be known as a closed-shop agreement, requiring that all employees covered by the agreement be members of the trade union.\"\n\nA closed-shop agreement is concluded by a majority union and an employer or an employers' organisation, by way of a collective agreement. The employees to be covered by the agreement must have a ballot before a closed-shop agreement is concluded. Two thirds of the employees (who will potentially be covered) who voted must have voted in favour of the agreement. Union subscription fees may not be used for political affiliation; they may be used only to advance the socioeconomic interests of the employees. Employees who were already employed when the closed-shop agreement came into effect, along with conscious objectors, may not be dismissed for refusing to join the union which is a party to a closed-shop agreement. A closed-shop agreement may be terminated if a majority of the employees votes for its termination. It is not unfair to dismiss an employee for refusing to join a union which is a party to a closed-shop agreement, or who is refused union membership, or has been expelled from a union which is a party to the agreement—provided that the refusal or expulsion is in accordance with the union’s constitution, and provided that the reason for the refusal or expulsion is a fair one.\n\nAn employee may not be required to be a member of a majority union before the commencement of employment. The latter is called a post entry closed-shop agreement. The opposite of this is a pre-entry closed-shop agreement: that is, a closed-shop agreement that requires an employee to be a member of a majority trade union before employment. Pre-entry closed shops are not allowed in South Africa.\n\nThere is an important difference between the two: In the agency shop, employees are not compelled to be or to become members of the trade union. In the closed shop, however, all employees who are covered by the collective agreement must be or must become members of the trade union.\n\nThe reason for these agreements relates to the nature and practice of collective bargaining. Under certain circumstances, employees who are not members of a trade union will be bound by the provisions of an agreement entered into by the union. In other circumstances, the employer may, in the interests of administrative convenience, extend the provisions of a collective agreement to non-union members. In effect, employees who are not members of the trade union may derive benefits from a collective agreement entered into by a union. \"Understandably,\" unions have reservations about this state of affairs. These non-union employees are sometimes called \"free riders,\" because they derive benefits for free: They do not pay union subscriptions, but they still obtain the benefits of the union’s collective bargaining. This is the main argument in favour of forcing employees either to belong to a union (in the case of closed-shop agreements) or to pay a fee (in the case of agency-shop agreements).\n\nThose who support union-security arrangements argue that they are necessary to avoid free riders. Furthermore, there is a view that they encourage \"responsible\" unionism. They support collective bargaining by aiding the development of strong and representative trade unions. Such arrangements are said to give union organizers a sense of security, and to enable them to devote themselves to the long-term interest of their members, \"instead of collecting subscriptions and trying to persuade reluctant employees to join.\" For some, the main justification for union-security arrangements is that they add to the power of the unions during the collective-bargaining process, creating a more effective counterbalance to the naturally superior economic power of the corporate employer. This they do by preventing the defection of members during wage bargaining which may lead to strike action.\n\nThere may also be some benefit in such arrangements for the employer. If all employees belong to one union (or contribute to that union), the employer need only deal with that specific union. As a collective-bargaining relationship grows, a certain pattern and consistency of collective bargaining can thus be formed.\n\nOn the other hand, those who consider that the unions already possess monopoly status and excessive power see union security arrangements, particularly the closed shop, \"as a main cause of undesirable state of affairs at the workplace.\" The main arguments against union security arrangements are,\n\n\nThe two ILO Conventions on freedom of association and collective bargaining do not make any express reference to the notion of union-security arrangements. The ILO Committee also left it to the practice and regulation of each state to authorise and, where necessary, to regulate the use of union-security clauses in practice.\n\nAccording to the Committee, union security arrangements are compatible with the ILO Conventions on freedom of association, provided that they are the results of free negotiations between workers’ organisations and employers. As long as this is the case, then, the international body will not interfere with them, provided that the law of a particular country does not go so far as to impose them generally and make union membership compulsory. However, when trade union security clauses are imposed by the law itself, then the right to join an organization of one's own choosing is compromised, and those provisions will be incompatible with the ILO Convention. Accordingly ILO member states are at liberty to include or not to include in their constitutions and labour legislation provisions regulating union-security arrangements.\n\nDespite the arguments in favour of agency shops and closed shops, it would appear \"prima facie\" that these types of agreement do infringe the employee’s freedom of association. Particularly in the case of a closed shop, an employee is no longer free not to associate: The employee \"must\" belong to a specific trade union. Employees are no longer free to choose which union they want to belong to, or even if they want to belong to a union at all. If the employee is not a member of a particular trade union, or if he loses his trade-union membership in terms of the union’s constitution, the employee may end up out of a job.\n\nIt has been argued, accordingly, that the closed-shop agreement amounts to an infringement of the employee’s freedom of association, as protected by sections 18 and 23 of the Constitution. The situation is different in the case of agency shops: The employee still has the freedom to choose whether or not he wants to belong to the union which is party to the collective agreement—\"that is if the employee wants to belong to a union in the first place.\"\n\nThe solution to this problem lies in a constitutional provision, section 23(6) of the Constitution, which provides that \"national Legislation may recognize union security arrangements contained in collective agreements. To the extent that the legislation may limit a right in this Chapter, the limitation must comply with s 36(1).\" In other words, union-security arrangements are permitted within the scheme of constitutional rights, and these arrangements may be recognized by national legislation (the LRA).\n\nAgency shops and closed shops, then, are not \"automatically\" unconstitutional, but a limitation of any right by a union-security arrangement must comply with section 36(1) of the Constitution, which provides that a fundamental right, such as freedom of association, may be limited by legislation as long as that limitation is reasonable and justifiable in an open and democratic society based on human dignity, equality and freedom. Section 36(1) contains a list of the factors that must be considered:\n\n\nApplied to agency and closed shops, the purpose of these arrangements is, at least in part, to enhance collective bargaining by the development of strong and powerful trade unions and stable bargaining relationships. (Collective bargaining is also protected by section 23 of the Constitution.)\n\nWhile agency shops do not represent all that serious an infringement of freedom of association, it is clear that the closed-shop agreement does. The question (which still awaits an answer) is whether or not it is really necessary to force employees to become members of a union, especially when a less restrictive method—that is, the agency shop—exists.\n\nDisputes about collective agreements (including closed- and agency-shop agreements) must be referred to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration for conciliation. If conciliation fails, any party to the dispute may refer the matter to arbitration. By way of exception, the LRA makes provision in this context for an appeal against an award issued by the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration commissioner. The arbitration award may be taken on appeal to the Labour Court.\n\nThe LRA does not impose a legal obligation on employers to bargain collectively with unions. The law encourages collective bargaining; it does not compel it. One of the ways it seeks to do this is by enabling trade unions to acquire organisational rights in certain circumstances. The granting of organisational rights to a trade union is seen as a way of enabling that trade union to establish a collective-bargaining relationship with an employer or employer’s organisation.\n\nThe trade union is the essential instrument for engaging in collective bargaining. The LRA sets certain minimum rights for trade unions (which may be expanded upon by agreement) in their engagement with employers. These organisational rights are granted to unions by the LRA to enable them to function more effectively, to build support at the workplace, and thereby to lay the foundations of a collective-bargaining relationship with the employer.\n\nIf the union, through the acquisition of organisational rights, gains sufficient membership and a significant presence in the workplace or industry, an employer or employers’ organisation may be persuaded to \"recognize\" the union for the purpose of collective bargaining.\n\nOrganisational rights are granted only to registered trade unions. The LRA does not compel trade unions and employers’ organisations to register, but it does encourage registration. It does this by granting most of the rights in the LRA only to registered unions. For instance, only a registered union may\n\n\nRegistration is not a prerequisite for protected strike action.\n\nOnce a trade union or employers' organisation has complied with the requirements set out in the LRA, the Registrar of Labour Relations must register the union or organisation. In respect of unions, there are four requirements to be met:\n\n\nThe first three requirements apply also in the case of an employers’ organisation; the last one, given the overlap, obviously does not.\n\nThe LRA makes provision for granting of five types of organisational rights. Other organisational rights may also be granted which are not referred to in the LRA; these must be obtained through negotiation and agreement. The five types of organisational rights made provision for in the LRA are listed and discussed below:\n\n\nThe logical place for contact between union representatives and the members they represent, as well as prospective members whom the union might recruit, is in the workplace. Section 12 of the LRA states that a registered trade union, sufficiently representative, has the right of access to the workplace. This right allows the union\n\n\nThe purpose of this access is for the union to recruit new members, to communicate with existing ones and to serve the interests of union members in other ways.\n\nThe right of access refers to access for union officials, to be clear, not just anyone who is affiliated with union. Nor do such officials also not have free rein. The right of access is not unlimited. Section 12(4) states that the exercise of the union’s right of access to the workplace may be subject to such conditions, as regards time and place, as are reasonable and necessary to protect life and property, or to prevent the undue disruption of work.\n\nIn the case of domestic workers, there is no right of access to workplace, given the intimate nature of the workplace.\n\nThis is the primary source of income for unions. Section 13 of the LRA grants unions the right to stop-order facilities. Union fees are used to perform the work and functions of the union, to hire officers and offices, and to provide training. There is no stipulation in the LRA or in related regulations as to how much unions are allowed to charge, but usually it is not much. The amount is determined by the constitution of the trade union.\n\nPayment is voluntary: A member of a registered and sufficiently representative union may authorize the employer, in writing, to deduct union subscriptions from his wages. Usually this is done on the union membership form. The employer should start to make the deductions agreed to as soon as possible, and should pay the subscription over to the union not later than the fifteenth day of each month.\n\nThe employee may subsequently revoke authorization, however, on written notice of a month, to both the employer and the trade union. At end of that period, employer must stop making the deduction.\n\nWhen paying deductions to the trade union, the employer must also furnish union with\n\n\nShop stewards are union representatives, \"the infantry of the trade union.\" They play a very important role in industrial relations, being in the best position to represent the union in the workplace and to relay information about the workplace to the union. They look after the day-to-day operation of the union and the protection and assistance of workers with their work-related problems. Their statutory role is to ensure compliance with the law and with collective agreements.\n\nSection 14 of the LRA provides that members of a registered trade union, provided that the union represents the majority of employees in the workplace, are entitled to elect trade-union representatives if the union has at least ten members in the workplace. The nomination, election, terms of office and removal from office of representatives are governed by the union’s constitution.\n\nThe number of representatives is determined according to the number of union members in the specific workplace. For example, if there are only between ten and fifty union members, there will be two representatives. The amount increases on a sliding scale. The maximum number of representatives is twenty.\n\nThe functions of union representatives are set out in section 14(4) of the LRA:\n\n\nShop stewards are employed by the employer, not by the union. Grogan describes \"the difficult position in which shop stewards find themselves,\" keeping two sets of books, or attempting \"to serve two masters,\" their employer and their trade union—masters whose interests are often diametrically opposed. \"This situation is particularly difficult,\" writes Grogan, \"when shop stewards also occupy supervisory or managerial positions.\" The courts have held, however, that employers may not for this reason forbid managerial employees from being elected as shop stewards; the most they can do is to discipline them if their union role actually prevents them from performing their managerial duties properly.\n\nThe distinction between union officials and union representatives (like shop stewards) is an important one. Trade-union officials are employees of the trade union; they perform various duties for the trade union in this capacity. Trade-union representatives, on the other hand, remain employees of the particular employer at the workplace, although they also represent the union in various ways within the workplace where they are employed.\n\nSection 14(5) of LRA entitles the trade-union representative to \"reasonable\" time off, during working hours, without loss of pay, to perform union functions and be trained in any subject relevant to performance of those functions. The meaning of \"reasonable\" in relation to paid time off is not stated in the Act.\n\nAttendance at union conferences and meetings may require the office-bearer to be absent from work. In terms of section 15(1), the office-bearer of a registered, sufficiently representative trade union is entitled to take reasonable leave during working hours for the purpose of performing the functions of his office. In terms of section 15(2), the union and employer may agree on the number of days’ leave, the number of days’ paid leave and the conditions attached to any leave. If the union and the employer are unable to reach an agreement, the dispute may be determined by an award made in terms of section 21 of the LRA.\n\nNo benchmark for shop stewards’ leave emerges from the decided cases, but arbitrators have generally accepted ten days per annum as \"reasonable.\" Employers may take disciplinary action against shop stewards if they exceed or abuse their powers by, for example, intimidating employees, including other shop stewards. Employers are entitled to refuse to deal with shop stewards if they have committed serious misconduct.\n\nItem 4(2) of the Code of Good Practice: Dismissal, seeks to discourage victimization of shop stewards by requiring employers to inform and \"consult\" their unions before taking disciplinary action against them for any reason. A number of cases concerning the dismissal of shop stewards have reached the courts. The approach in such cases is to determine\n\n\nIf it does, the dismissal is ‘automatically’ unfair, and the shop steward will invariably be reinstated.\n\nFor a trade union to do its job effectively, it may need access to certain information. Section 16 provides for the provision of information both to trade-union representatives and to trade unions. Only registered unions which represent the majority of the employees in the workplace are entitled to rely on section 16.\n\nOnly relevant information must be disclosed: That is to say, in terms of section 16(2), all relevant information that will allow the representative trade union to engage effectively in consultation or collective bargaining must be disclosed. The information must be relevant to the effective performance of functions in terms of section 14(4). There is, in other words, an important link between the information required and the function of the representative. Often the requirement of \"relevance\" means relevance to the performance of a specific task.\n\nTypically the information in question is in the hands of the employer. A common example is production plans or plans for restructuring, which will affect or cause retrenchment.\n\nThe registered majority union has a right to information when the employer is actually involved in consultation or bargaining with the union, or when consultation or bargaining is about to start. For example, at annual wage negotiations, the employer may argue that its financial position, both short- and long-term, is poor. The trade union may dispute this and demand that all relevant information on which the employer bases this argument be disclosed. The employer would then have to furnish, for example, proof of cancellation of orders, and reasons for such cancellation, any existing and possible new orders, and financial statements.\n\nThe employer, however, cannot be expected to disclose information which\n\n\nIf the employer regards certain types of information as confidential, it must notify the union of this fact.\n\nDisputes on the disclosure of information are to be referred to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration, which will attempt to settle the dispute through conciliation and, failing that, arbitration.\n\nWhether a trade union is entitled to organisational rights depends on the level of representativeness of the trade union in the workplace, which can be either majority representation or \"sufficient\" representation. If a union represents the majority of workers, it will have access to all organisational rights. If the union is sufficiently representative, it will have access only to certain organisational rights: the rights of access, leave and stop-order facilities. The rights to elect shop stewards and to disclosure of information, on the other hand, are reserved for unions that have as members the majority of the employees in the workplace.\n\nUsually, only a single union will be seeking organisational rights, but two or more unions may also act together to do so.\n\nWhere the union has a majority, representing 50 per cent plus one, or more, of all employees in the workplace, it enjoys the following organisational rights:\n\n\nWhere the union is \"sufficiently represented,\" it represents less than the majority of employees in the workplace. There is no fixed rule as to \"sufficient representation;\" it is decided on a case-by-case basis. A sufficiently representative union enjoys the following organisational rights:\n\n\nIf the union is a member of a bargaining council, it enjoys the following organisational rights:\n\n\nIf it is a minority union, it may enforce its rights through collective bargaining and industrial action. Two or more trade unions may act jointly to acquire rights.\n\nThe LRA does not define \"sufficient representation,\" but it does give guidelines. Factors to be taken into account would include the nature of the workplace and the industry involved, as well as the presence or absence of other unions with membership in the workplace. The approximate figure is thirty per cent.\n\nIn \"UPUSA v Komming Knitting\", the Commissioner extended the right to access the workplace, together with the right to deductions of union subscriptions, to a union which, at the time of the award, represented just seven employees out of 31. The Commissioner made this decision on the basis\n\n\nThe Commissioner held that the union seemed capable of recruiting a majority of the workers at the workplace.\n\nIn \"SACTWU v Marley\", the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration refused organisational rights to a union with 42 per cent representivity, on the basis that another union represented 56 per cent of employees in the workplace, and because the employer had a long association with the other union, which included an agency-shop agreement.\n\nIn \"NUMSA v Feltex Foam\", the question was whether differing degrees of \"sufficient representativeness\" could be set for different organisational rights: a higher degree for gaining access to workplace, for example, than for stop-order facilities. The Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration held that there have to be very special circumstances to allow him to distinguish between such rights. If the arbitrator is prepared to grant one of these rights, in other words, there would have to be special circumstances to justify a refusal to grant any of the others.\n\nIn \"Organisation of Labour Affairs v Old Mutual Life Assurance\", the Commissioner was prepared to order the employer to grant access to the workplace and stop-order facilities to a union with level of representivity which would not ordinarily have permitted the granting of these rights, on the basis that the rights had been granted to other unions with lower representivity. A similar approach was adopted in \"Group 4 Falck v DUSWO\".\n\nThe effect of these decisions is that, when an employer grants organisational rights to a union with, for example, only ten per cent representivity, the employer cannot really argue that another union seeking organisation rights must have at least thirty per cent.\n\nSection 18 allows an employer and majority union in a workplace, as well as parties to a bargaining council, to establish by collective agreement the level of representativeness required for the purposes of gaining access, deductions and leave at a particular workplace.\n\nThe only limit is that the agreed threshold must be applied equally to all unions seeking to exercise any, or all, of these rights.\n\nThe \"workplace\" is defined in section 213 of LRA. There is a distinction to be drawn, in this regard, between the public service and the private sector.\n\n\nIf the private employer has two businesses, independent of each other by reason of size or function or organisation, the place where the employees work in connection with each independent operation constitutes the workplace for that operation. This foresees the possibility that geographically distinct operations may constitute one workplace. Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration commissioners been unwilling to accept too easily that geographically distinct places of work constitute separate workplaces.\n\nIn \"Speciality Stores v SACCAWU\", the Labour Court was loath to find, in the absence of proof by the trade union, that different stores of a retailer constituted different workplaces. The court also made it clear that the onus rests on the union to prove that two operations are two different workplaces.\n\nEmployers and majority unions are permitted to conclude collective agreements that set thresholds for the acquisition of rights under sections 12 (union access to the workplace), 13 (stop-orders) and 15 (time off). This right is conferred by section 18 (\"Right to establish thresholds of representativeness\"), which reads as follows:\n\n(1) An employer and a registered trade union whose members are a majority of the employees employed by that employer in a workplace, or the parties to a bargaining council, may conclude a collective agreement establishing a threshold of representativeness required in respect of one or more of the organisational rights referred to in sections 12, 13 and 15.\n(2) A collective agreement concluded in terms of subsection (1) is not binding unless the thresholds of representativeness in the collective agreement are applied equally to any registered trade union seeking any of the organisational rights referred to in that subsection.\n\nA threshold agreement, then, is an agreement to restrict certain rights to unions with a certain percentage of representation. The idea is to prevent union fragmentation, and to make bargaining genuinely collective.\n\nTrade unions may acquire organisational rights in the following ways:\n\n\nThe LRA makes provision in section 20 for a registered trade union and an employer or employers' organisation to conclude a collective agreement that regulates organisational rights. This means that, even if the trade union is not representative, it could have organisational rights on which the parties agreed.\n\nThis route generally begins with an approach by the union to the employer, and a request that it grant the union organisational rights. Section 20 does not prescribe any representivity requirements before the employer will be entitled to grant such rights in a collective agreement. Even a union with only a small degree of representivity, therefore, may obtain organisational rights.\n\nIn terms of section 19 of the LRA, a registered trade union, if party to a bargaining council, automatically acquires the right of access to the premises, together with the right to have trade union subscriptions deducted by stop orders, in respect of all workplaces falling within the jurisdiction of the bargaining council. Again, it does not matter, for the purposes of this route, how representative the union is in the specific workplace. A union acquires these rights irrespective of whether it is sufficiently representative or not.\n\nBriefly, the section-21 procedure involves notice by the union to the employer of its intention to seek organisational rights, consultation between union and employer in an attempt to reach a collective agreement, and referral by the union of a dispute, if any, to the CCMA, which will attempt to settle the matter through conciliation, failing which it will arbitrate the dispute and issue a binding award. The union in this case must be registered, and must enjoy a certain level of representation in the workplace.\n\nThe onus rests on the union to notify the employer, in writing, that it intends to seek the organisational rights conferred by the Act. The notice must contain the following information:\n\n\nThe notice must be accompanied by a certified copy of the trade union registration certificate.\n\nWithin thirty days of receiving the notice, employer must meet with the union. The parties must then try to conclude a collective agreement regulating the manner in which the organisational rights will be exercised. The employer may refuse to grant union rights on the grounds there is a dispute as to what constitutes a \"workplace,\" or because the employer argues that the union does not enjoy the required degree of representativeness.\n\nIf the parties fail to conclude a collective agreement, either of the parties may refer the dispute, in writing, to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration for conciliation. If conciliation fails, either party may request that the dispute be arbitrated. The CCMA has jurisdiction to arbitrate only if the union has complied with all the provisions of section 21, which are peremptory. Failure by the union to comply with them will mean that Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration may not deal with the dispute.\n\nThe CCMA commissioner will be called upon to decide whether or not the union is representative. Section 21 authorizes him to make inquiries, conduct a ballot and take all other relevant information into account.\n\nOnce the actual number of members has been established, section 21(8) provides that the commissioner\n\n\nHere the LRA gives \"clear legislative support for the principle of majoritarianism.\"\n\nIn this regard, the commissioner must consider\n\n\nIf the employer is of the opinion that the union is no longer representative, it may refer matter to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration, requesting that it withdraw the organisational rights. The commissioner may withdraw any of the organisational rights once conferred which are exercised by any other registered trade union in respect of that workplace, if that other union has ceased to be a representative union.\n\nIn order to determine the membership or support of the registered trade union, the Commissioner may\n\n\nThe employer must co-operate with the Commissioner and make available any information and facilities that are reasonably necessary for this purpose. An employer who alleges that a union is no longer a representative trade union may apply to the CCMA to withdraw any of the organisational rights previously granted.\n\nIn summary, the section 21 procedure runs as follows:\n\n\nThe LRA Amendment Bill now before parliament proposes to amend section 21. Section 8A of the proposed amendment would allow a non-majority trade union to bring shop stewards into the workplace.\n\nThe LRA would prohibit a strike in support of a demand that the employer grant all or some organisational rights to a union, because such a dispute may be referred to arbitration in terms of section 21. Section 65(2)(a) specifically \"permits\" a union which would otherwise have the right to refer a dispute about organisational rights to arbitration in terms of section 21 to embark on strike action in an attempt to force employer to grant these rights.\n\nA trade union, including a minority union, may therefore strike in support of a demand for organisational rights even if it does not meet the statutory threshold for acquiring such rights. Except for the right to information, in fact, organisational rights are the only rights conferred by the LRA over which strikes are permitted.\n\nThis is the consequence of \"NUMSA v Bader Bop\", where NUMSA, although not a majority union, sought to acquire the right to elect shop stewards by striking. The lower courts were divided. A divided Labour Appeal Court held that minority unions could not do strike for such a right because,\n\n\nThis judgment was overturned by the Constitutional Court, however, which held that the minority unions may strike in support of demands for organisational rights to which they are not entitled under the LRA.\n\nThe Constitutional Court found that nothing in section 20 of the LRA precludes a collective agreement granting collective-bargaining rights, even if the qualification for representativity is not met. The court's interpretation of this was that, if a minority union asks for, but does not succeed in acquiring, the organisational rights in question, and if conciliation subsequently fails, the dispute-resolution mechanism is to strike for it.\n\nThis judgment has been severely criticized.\n\nIf the union uses the strike remedy, but is unsuccessful in forcing employer to grant the rights, the union loses the right to use the section-21 procedure for one year from date on which notice was given of the intention to go on strike.\n\nIf there is a dispute about the interpretation of organisational rights, any party may refer the dispute in writing to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration for conciliation and, if conciliation fails, for arbitration.\n\nDisputes about disclosure of information follow the same route. In determining the dispute, the Commissioner must strike a balance between the employer’s right to privacy and the interests of sound collective bargaining. The Commissioner has a fairly wide discretion to make a suitable award to achieve this.\n\nThe legal rules relating to freedom of association and organisational rights are all aimed at making collective bargaining possible. There are specific rules that govern the collective bargaining process and the result thereof: collective agreements.\n\nNeither the Constitution nor the LRA defines \"collective bargaining.\" This is primarily because the law does not impose a legal duty to bargain on employers and trade unions.\n\nCollective bargaining must be understood as a process. The process of collective bargaining entails negotiations between the two parties:\n\n\nBroadly, then, the collective-bargaining process may be defined as a process whereby employers (or employers’ organisations) bargain with employee representatives (trade unions) about terms and conditions of employment, and about other matters of mutual interest.\n\nUnlike mere consultation, collective bargaining presumes a willingness from each party, not only to listen to and consider the representations of the other party, but also to abandon its own fixed positions where possible, in order to find common ground.\n\nBargaining occurs, \"inter alia\",\n\n\nBargaining, then, is a dynamic process.\n\nCollective bargaining is mainly concerned with disputes of interest, but not to the exclusion of disputes of right.\n\nThe word \"collective\" refers to the fact that employees join together in trade unions to increase their power in bargaining with employers over wages, working conditions and any other matters of mutual interest between them. It is important to note that, on the workers' side, only trade unions may engage in collective bargaining. Although a single employer can engage in collective bargaining, an individual employee cannot, by definition, engage in collective bargaining.\n\nIf successful, collective bargaining leads to a settlement and the conclusion of a collective agreement. If it fails, there are several options available to the employer or the union, including\n\n\nWhen a trade union enters into the collective-bargaining process, it will normally have one of three objectives in mind:\n\n\nThe LRA makes provision for the establishment of two institutions within which collective bargaining may take place:\n\n\nThe establishment, composition and function of bargaining councils and statutory councils are regulated in some detail by the LRA. Employers and trade unions remain free, however, to agree to their own collective-bargaining fora and procedures. The Act, however, does not regulate this \"non-statutory collective bargaining\" in any detail; it is left to the employer and the trade union to reach agreement on issues such as\n\n\nThe only facet of this type of bargaining regulated by the LRA is the legal effect and binding nature of collective agreements entered into.\n\nIt could be argued that the constitutional right to bargain collectively (s 23(5)) includes both a legally enforceable right to bargain collectively, as well as a corresponding duty to bargain collectively on the other party to the relationship. Since the LRA does not create a duty to bargain, this may give rise to the argument that the Act does not go far enough in protecting and giving content to the constitutional right. This debate may have to be solved by the courts in the future. For now, however, there is no general duty to bargain on employers and trade unions in terms of the LRA. An employer may refuse to engage with a trade union; in turn, the trade union may take strike action.\n\nThe question of whether the constitutional right to bargain collectively includes a duty on the other party has arisen in connection with one group of persons not covered by the Act: members of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF). In three separate disputes, the High Court had to consider whether the South African National Defense Force Union (SANDU) may rely on the provisions of section 23 in order to obtain a court order to require the State to bargain collectively with it. These decisions, and their arguments, were contradictory.\n\nThe SCA, on appeal, held that the constitutional provision does not impose a judicially enforceable duty to bargain on employers or employees. On further appeal, however, the Constitutional court left the question open. It did point out, however, that the contrary approach could create difficulties. It came close, then, to agreeing with the SCA that no duty to bargain collectively exists in South African labour law.\n\nAlthough the LRA does not compel parties to bargain with each other, it encourages collective bargaining through the granting of organisational rights, the right to establish bargaining institutions and closed-shop and agency-shop agreements. Should an employer refuse to bargain, the Act allows for strike action by employees to convince the employer to bargain. A refusal to bargain includes:\n\n\nDisputes regarding refusal to bargain must first be referred to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration for an advisory award. An advisory award provides guidance only; it is not binding on the parties.\n\nCollective bargaining is performed by bargaining agents, namely trade unions and employers’ organisations. The LRA sets requirements for unions and organisations relating to registration. A trade union is defined as an association of employees whose principal purpose is to regulate the relations between employers or employers’ organisations and employees. Only employees may be members of a trade union. Job seekers and ex-employees may not be members of a trade union.\n\nTo qualify as a trade union, an association of employees need not be registered. Registration is beneficial, however, since only a registered trade union is entitled to rights, such as the right to\n\n\nThe powers and functions of a bargaining council are outlined in section 28 of the LRA. A bargaining council has three main functions:\n\n\nCollective bargaining can take place at plant level, sector level or industry level. The LRA encourages collective bargaining at sector or industry level. Provision is made for the establishment of bargaining councils for a particular sector. It is at this level that bargaining will take place in bargaining councils. Moreover, bargaining councils may be established in the private as well as the public sector. The private sector is the economic sector in which the State is not the employer; in the public sector, the State is the employer.\n\ndisputes.\nand incapacity: A bargaining council may conciliate and arbitrate these disputes by way of the con-arb procedure.\n\nThe main goal of collective bargaining between an employer and a trade union is to reach consensus about certain matters and formalise their relationship by means of a collective agreement. A collective agreement regulates the rights and duties of parties, as well as the terms and conditions of the employment of workers.\n\nIn terms of section 213 of the LRA, a collective agreement is a written agreement concerning terms and conditions of employment or any other matter of mutual interest concluded by one or more registered trade unions, on the one hand and, on the other\n\n\nThe parties, therefore, are\n\n\nThere are three important elements that distinguish a collective agreement from any other agreement between employees and employers:\n\n\nA collective agreement need not be signed by the parties to the agreement to be valid. All that is required is that the agreement be in writing. It is not even necessary that the collective agreement be contained in a single document. It would, however, be advisable for the parties to the agreement to sign a single written document, as this would assist in eliminating later disputes as to whether or not an agreement was actually entered into, and what the content of the agreement was.\n\nOnly registered unions may be parties to collective agreements, but a union being unregistered does not mean that the union may not conclude an agreement with an employer; it simply means that the agreement will fall outside the scope of the LRA, and will not be enforceable in terms of the LRA. A single employer may conclude a collective agreement; a single employee cannot. The reason for this is the inequality of power between an employer and a single employee, and that a single employee is not a \"collective\".\n\nThe definition also states what topics must be regulated by a collective agreement. It must deal with the terms and conditions of employment, and other matters of mutual interest between the parties. Terms and conditions of employment relate to those substantive provisions of the employment relationship, like working hours, remuneration and leave. Collective agreements can also regulate the granting of organisational rights to registered unions.\n\nA distinction must be drawn between parties to the agreement and members of the parties to the agreement. Section 23 of the LRA provides that the following entities or persons are bound by a collective agreement:\n\n\nA collective agreement binds for the whole period of the collective agreement every person bond in terms of section (1)(c) who was a member at the time it became binding, or who becomes a member after it became binding, whether or not that person continues to be a member of the registered trade union or registered employers’ organisation for the duration of the collective agreement.\n\nWhere applicable, a collective agreement varies any contract of employment between an employee and an employer if they are both bound by the collective agreement.\n\nUnless the collective agreement provides otherwise, any party to a collective agreement that is concluded for an indefinite period may terminate the agreement by giving reasonable notice in writing to the other parties.\n\nTo encourage workers’ participation in the workplace, the concept of a \"workplace forum\" has been introduced by the LRA. A workplace forum is an in-house institution promoting workers’ participation in decision making at the workplace. Workplace fora are intended to deal with non-wage-related issues such as restructuring, introduction of new technology, new work methods, and the like.\n\nIt is important not to confuse a trade union and a workplace forum, as the latter is not a bargaining structure:\n\n\nAll employees, including non-union members, may be members of a forum. Senior managerial employees, however, may not be members of a forum. Only registered trade unions or trade unions acting jointly, representing the majority of all employees employed in the workplace, may apply for the establishment of a forum.\n\nA forum may be established in any workplace of employers with more than 100 employees, either through a collective agreement or through the intervention of the CCMA. Only larger employers, therefore, will be involved in fora.\n\nA forum must meet regularly. Its functions are to consult on certain matters and to have joint decision making on other matters.\n\nConsultation entails that the employer\n\n\nConsultation must take place before the employer implements any proposal.\n\nJoint decision making requires the employer to consult and reach consensus with a forum.\n\nMatters for consultation include (unless they are regulated by a collective agreement) proposals relating to\n\n\nA bargaining council or a representative union and an employer may conclude a collective agreement granting a forum the right to be consulted about additional matters that fall within the council’s registered scope.\n\nMatters for joint decision making cannot be regulated by a collective agreement. Matters for joint decision making relate to\n\n\nA representative union and the employer may also enter into a collective agreement conferring on the forum joint decision making in respect of additional matters or removing other matters.\n\nIn fulfilling its duties to consult and to have joint decision making, an employer is required to disclose all relevant information that will allow the forum to participate effectively in consultation and joint decision making. The employer is not obliged to disclose information, however,\n\n\nDisputes about disclosure of information must be referred to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration. If parties fail to resolve the dispute through conciliation, any party to the dispute may request arbitration.\n\nThe Commissioner will not compel the employer to disclose \"irrelevant\" information.\n\nDespite the potentially important influence that a forum may have on a workplace, few such forums are found in practice. This is due to employers' viewing fora as an inroad to managerial prerogative, and the concern of unions that fora will undermine collective bargaining structures.\n\nAt the end of a collective-bargaining session or process, parties may either reach an agreement or fail to do so. If an agreement is reached, a collective agreement is concluded. If no agreement is reached, parties may agree on mediation or arbitration, or decide to exert pressure on each other through industrial action.\n\nIndustrial action, sometimes also called collective action, generally refers to employees acting together to force the hand of the employer, but employers, too, for the purposes of industrial action, employers may act individually or collectively with other employers to lock out employees. Industrial action for employees can take the form of strikes, secondary strikes, pickets and protest action, while employers have recourse to lock-outs.\n\nStrikes and lock-outs are a reality in the workplace—\"just like friction in a marriage is a reality.\" Conflict in the workplace—\"and in a marriage\"—is not necessarily negative:\n\nIt gives the parties an opportunity to reaffirm their different bargaining strengths and positions. Conflict becomes problematic only if matters get out of hand as a result of the power struggle. That will then undermine the purpose of the conflict.\nAnother problematic aspect of conflict is that once parties are in a stand-off, the matter will not be resolved without a \"loser\" and a \"winner\". In the long run, this may lead to a deterioration of the relationship and it may even spark further friction about other issues.\n\nIn the workplace, again \"just like in a marriage,\" the law seeks \"to ensure healthy and productive conflict that can lead to the resolution of matters of mutual interest.\" The LRA sets out the manner in which this is to be done by regulating various types of industrial action.\n\nIn the past few years, South Africa has seen a high level of industrial action. The Department of Labour has reported that working days lost to work stoppages in 2010 were the highest ever, with approximately 20,674,737 working days lost from about 74 work stoppages; in 2009, there were only 51.\n\nThe right to strike is clearly protected in South Africa through the Constitution, which guarantees that \"every worker has the right [...] to strike.\" The Constitution does not give employers the right to lock out employees. Employers’ right to lock-out is implied in the Constitution’s express protection of the right to bargain collectively. The LRA provides, however, in section 64(1), that every employee has the right to strike, and that every employer has recourse to a lock-out.\n\nNeither the right to strike nor the right to a lock-out is directly protected in terms of an ILO Convention, but it is indirectly done through ILO Convention 87 and ILO Convention 98, which were both ratified by South Africa.\n\nBoth strikes and lock-outs are essential elements of collective bargaining, but \"such rights should be used only as measures of last resort.\" Strikes are used by employees to back up their demands in promoting and defending their employment-related interests; lock-outs are used by employers to back up their employment-related demands.\n\nIn matters of industrial action, \"it is important to know what type of action to take.\" Different types of industrial action serve different purposes. The purpose of the employer or the employees will determine the type of action to be taken:\n\n\nNot only is it important to ensure that the right type of action is chosen; it is important \"also to ensure that the action will be protected by the LRA.\" In the case of a protected strike or lock-out—it used to be called a \"legal\" strike or lock-out under the 1956 LRA—the parties taking part in the action are not guilty of breach of contract and cannot be dismissed for that reason. The court may not order an interdict to stop the action from continuing, and the participants in the industrial action will not be held liable for compensation for the work stoppage.\n\nNo right is unlimited. Rights may be limited in the interests of society or by the rights of others. Section 36(1) of the Constitution provides for the limitation of rights in terms of law of general application. The LRA is such a law. It limits the right to strike.\n\nStrikes and lock-outs are not automatically protected, as there are some hurdles that employees and employers have to cross before their actions will be protected:\n\n\nIt is important that the actions taken by employees and employers fall within the definitions of a strike or a lock-out. Action that does not amount to a strike or a lock-out will not enjoy protection in terms of the LRA. This is the first hurdle to be crossed by employees and unions for a protected strike, and by employers for a protected lock-out. This hurdle stands on two legs:\n\n\n\"Strike\" is defined as follows:\n\nthe partial or complete concerted refusal to work, or the retardation or obstruction of work, by persons who are or have been employed by the same employer or by different employers, for the purposes of remedying a grievance or resolving a dispute in respect of any matter of mutual interest between employer and employee and every reference to work in this definition includes overtime work, whether it is voluntary or compulsory.\n\nExcept for \"protest action,\" any intentional refusal to work will amount to misconduct unless it can be regarded as strike action in terms of the above definition. In order to qualify as strike action, the employees must comply with the following three elements contained in the definition:\n\n\nThere must be a refusal to work in order for an action to qualify as a strike. This is the first hurdle that employees must cross. The refusal to work must be\n\n\nThe action may be partial (in that the employees still perform some of their duties), or complete (in that the employees do not perform any of their duties), or the retardation of work (where employees work, but at a reduced pace), or obstruction of work (where employees disturb production through their actions). A refusal by employees to work overtime also constitutes a strike, whether the overtime is compulsory (required by a contract or by a collective agreement) or voluntary.\n\nAlthough the Constitution grants individual workers the right to strike, the right itself cannot be exercised individually. The action must be\n\n\nAn individual employee cannot engage in a strike. More than one person must be involved in order for the action to constitute a strike. The action must be carried out by people acting together who are or have been employed by the same employer or by different employers (as in the case of an industry-wide strike). The action is thus directed at the employer or employers. If, for example, employees refuse to work because they have a demand against a union, that will not amount to strike action. An exception exists in respect of secondary strikes.\n\nThe refusal to work must be for the common purpose of remedying a grievance or resolving a dispute in respect of any matter of mutual interest between the employer and employee. A grievance or an issue in dispute in respect of a matter of mutual interest must exist, therefore, before an action may be deemed a strike. Where there is no grievance or dispute against the employer, there cannot be a strike. While the concept of \"mutual interest\" is not defined in the LRA, it was described as \"whatever can be fairly and reasonably regarded as calculated to promote the well-being of the trade concerned.\"\n\nMatters of mutual interest may include, for example,\n\n\nAn important indication that a matter is one of mutual interest would be that the matter can be dealt with through collective bargaining. For example, political issues or demands against the State do not qualify, unless the State is the employer and the demands relate to the State’s role as employer. These political issues or demands should be dealt with by way of protest action.\n\nWhile employees have the right to strike in terms of the Constitution and the LRA, employers do not have a right to lock-out, but they do have recourse to a lock-out in terms of section 64 of the LRA.\n\n\"Lock-out\" is defined as\n\nthe exclusion by an employer of employees from the employer’s workplace, for the purpose of compelling the employees to accept a demand in respect of any matter of mutual interest between employer and employee, whether or not the employer breaches those employees’ contracts of employment in the course of or for the purpose of that exclusion.\n\nTo constitute a lock-out, the employer’s action must contain the following two elements:\n\n\nThe second hurdle to be crossed in order for a strike or lock-out to be regarded as protected is that certain procedural requirements must be complied with. This hurdle stands on the three legs prescribed by section 64(1):\n\n\nThe LRA defines an \"issue in dispute\" as \"the demand, the grievance, or the dispute that forms the subject matter of the strike or lock-out.\" The issue in dispute must fall within the definition of a strike (or lock-out). In other words, the demand, grievance or dispute about which the employees strike (or the employer locks out) must relate to a matter of mutual interest.\n\nThe LRA requires that parties must try to resolve the issue. It requires that the parties first refer the dispute to a bargaining council (if there is one for that sector). If no bargaining council exists, the dispute must be referred to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration for conciliation.\n\nThe bargaining council or the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration must attempt to resolve the dispute through conciliation within thirty days of the referral. If the parties to the dispute reach an agreement, the dispute is resolved. If no agreement is reached, the conciliator must issue a certificate to indicate that the matter has not been resolved. After this (or after thirty days have gone by since referral of the dispute for conciliation), the parties can give notice of the proposed strike (or lock-out).\n\nIf conciliation fails, or thirty days have passed since the referral of the dispute, at least 48 hours’ written notice must be given of the commencement of the strike or lock-out.

{"id": "978991", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=978991", "title": "Stamp act", "text": "Stamp act\n\nA stamp act is any legislation that requires a tax to be paid on the transfer of certain documents. Those who pay the tax receive an official stamp on their documents, making them legal documents. A variety of products have been covered by stamp acts including playing cards, dice, patent medicines, cheques, mortgages, contracts, marriage licenses and newspapers. The items often have to be physically stamped at approved government offices following payment of the duty, although methods involving annual payment of a fixed sum or purchase of adhesive stamps are more practical and common.\n\nThis system of taxation was first devised in the Netherlands in 1624 after a public competition to find a new form of tax. Stamp acts have been enforced in many countries, including Australia, Canada, People's Republic of China, Ireland, India, Malaysia, Israel, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.\n\nThe taxes raised under a stamp act are called stamp duty.\n\nStamps acts were enacted in various Australian states in 1878, 1882, 1886, 1890, and 1894, with amendments from 1892 to 1907. According to these acts, stamps were required on many types of business transactions: negotiable instruments, promissory notes, bills of lading, and receipts.\n\nIn Western Australia, duties of this type were overhauled in the Western Australian Stamp Act 1921, which took effect on 1 January 2010. In South Australia, the Stamp Duties Act 1923 was first enacted in 1923, then revised or amended almost yearly until its current version of 2017.\n\nA stamp duty was first introduced in England in 1694 following the Dutch model as \"An act for granting to Their Majesties several duties on Vellum, Parchment and Paper for 10 years, towards carrying on the war against France\" (5 & 6 Will. & Mar. c. 21). The duty ranged between 1 penny to several shillings on a number of different legal documents including insurance policies, documents used as evidence in courts, grants of honour, grants of probate and letters of administration. It raised around £50,000 a year and although it was initially a temporary measure, it proved so successful that its use was continued.\n\nThe Stamp Act of 1712 was an act passed in the United Kingdom on 1 August 1712 to create a new tax on publishers, particularly of newspapers. The initial assessed rate of tax was one penny per whole newspaper sheet, a halfpenny for a half sheet, and one shilling per advertisement contained within. Other than newspapers, it required that all pamphlets, legal documents, commercial bills, advertisements, and other papers be issued the tax. The act was increased in 1797 with greater taxes and wider spectrum of materials affected, reached its height around 1815 during the \"taxes on knowledge\" struggle, reduced in 1836, and repealed in 1855.\n\nThe stamp tax was a tax on each newspaper and thus hit cheaper papers and popular readership harder than wealthy consumers, because it formed a higher proportion of the purchase price. The act had a chilling effect on publishers; the tax is blamed for the decline of English literature critical of the government during the period, notably with \"The Spectator\" ending the same year of the tax's enactment. Its repeal in 1855 allowed a cheap press again.\n\nAll the above Acts were superseded by the Stamp Duties Management Act 1891 and the Stamp Act 1891, which still constitute the bulk of UK law on stamp duties today.\n\nFrom 1914 to 1928, the Director of Stamping at the Stamp Office oversaw the production of \"Treasury Notes\" (a type of banknote, not to be confused with US Treasury notes). These were issued for denominations of £1 and 10's to enable coins to be removed from circulation and were not convertible to gold. Existing Bank of England banknotes in higher denominations continued to circulate alongside the Treasury Notes. In 1963 production of postage stamps passed to the General Post Office.\n\nThe Finance Act 1986 introduced Stamp Duty Reserve Tax. From October 27, 1986, the charge was imposed on 'closing' transactions at the London Stock Exchange which until then had been transactions where no document was used and therefore exempt from Stamp Duty.\n\nA public display of Stamp Office artifacts and records was held at the Courtauld Institute in 1994 to commemorate the three hundredth anniversary of the introduction of UK Stamp Duty. The Stamp Office was also awarded the Charter Mark by John Major's Advisory Committee as a reward for its public service.\n\nStamp duties are the oldest taxes still raised by the HM Revenue and Customs.\n\nIsrael used to have a stamp duty on signed documents, which was regulated by the 1961 \"Stamp Tax on Documents\" (Law 5731-1961), the 1965 \"Stamp Tax on Documents Regulations\", and subsequent Additions. The stamp duty was repealed as of 2006.\n\nAs part of domestic taxation, the PRC includes a stamp tax as one of the \"behavioural taxes\". Foreign investors are also subject to a stamp tax. Stamp taxes in China are governed by \"Provisional Regulations of the People's Republic of China Concerning Stamp Tax Detailed Rules for Its Implementation\", implemented in 1988. In 1997, stamp taxes produced revenue of 26.63 billion yuan and comprised 3.6% of China's gross domestic product.\n\nAfter Great Britain was victorious over France in the Seven Years' War – which manifested in America as the French and Indian War – a small Stamp Act was enacted that covered of all sorts of documents. The Stamp Act 1765 (short title \"Duties in American Colonies Act 1765\"; 5 George III, c. 12) was a direct tax imposed by the British Parliament on the colonies of British America. The act required that many printed materials in the colonies be produced on stamped paper produced in London and carrying an embossed revenue stamp. These printed materials were on every legal document, magazine, and newspaper, plus many other types of paper used throughout the colonies, including playing cards. Unlike previous taxes, the stamp tax had to be paid in valid British currency, not in colonial paper money. \n\nThe purpose of the tax was to help pay for troops stationed in North America. The British government felt that the colonies were the primary beneficiaries of this military presence, and the colonial population should pay at least a portion of the expense. The colonists claimed their constitutional rights were violated since only their own colonial legislatures could levy taxes. The colonies sent no representatives to Parliament, and therefore had no influence over what taxes were raised, how they were levied, or how they would be spent. Some opponents of the Stamp Act distinguished between \"internal\" taxes like the stamp duty, which they claimed Parliament had no right to impose, and revenue legitimately raised through the regulation on trade. In general, however, most colonists considered the Act to be a violation of their rights as Englishmen to be taxed without their consent – consent that only the colonial legislatures could grant because Americans were unrepresented in Parliament. The rallying cry of \"No Taxation without Representation\" reflected an increasingly major grievance that led to the American Revolution. The Americans saw no need for the troops or the taxes; the British saw colonial defiance of their lawful rulers.\n\nThe Stamp Act met great resistance in the colonies. Colonial assemblies sent petitions and protests. Local protest groups, led by colonial merchants and landowners, established connections through correspondence – the so-called \"Committees of Correspondence – that created a loose coalition extending from New England to Georgia. British goods were boycotted. Opposition to the tax also took the form of violence and intimidation. Custom houses and tax collectors were attacked. Protests and demonstrations initiated by the newly formed Sons of Liberty often turned violent and destructive as the masses became involved. A word used frequently by colonists was \"liberty\" during the Stamp Act upheaval. Opponents of the new tax staged mock funerals in which \"liberty's\" coffin was carried to a burial ground. They insisted that liberty could not be \"taken away without consent.\"\n\nA more reasoned approach was taken by some elements. James Otis, Jr. wrote the most influential protest, \"The Rights of the British Colonies Asserted and Proved\". Otis, the radical leader in Massachusetts, convinced the Massachusetts assembly to send a circular letter to the other colonies, which called for an inter-colonial meeting to plan tempered resistance. The Stamp Act Congress convened in New York City on October 7, 1765, with nine colonies in attendance; others would likely have participated if earlier notice had been provided. The Stamp Act Congress was another step in the process of attempted common problem-solving. The Albany Congress in 1754 had been held at the urging of royal officials as a forum for voicing constitutional concerns and afforded the more conservative critics of British policy some hope of regaining control of events from the unruly mobs in the streets of many cities; in contrast, the Stamp Act Congress was strictly a colonial affair, reflecting the first significant joint colonial response to any British measure. Delegates to the Stamp Act Congress approved a fourteen-point \"Declaration of Rights and Grievances\" as a petition to the Parliament and the King, formulated largely by John Dickinson of Pennsylvania. The statement echoed the recent resolves of the Virginia House of Burgesses, which argued that colonial taxation could only be carried on by their own assemblies. The delegates singled out the Stamp Act and the use of the vice-admiralty courts for special criticism, yet ended their statement with a pledge of loyalty to the King.\n\nOpposition to the Stamp Act was not limited to the colonies. In Canada, Nova Scotia largely ignored the Act; they allowed ships bearing unstamped papers to enter its ports, and business continued unabated after the distributors ran out of stamps. Newfoundland experienced some protests and petitions based on legislation dating back to the reign of Edward VI forbidding any sort of duties on the importation of goods related to its fisheries. The Caribbean colonies also protested. Political opposition was expressed in a number of colonies, including Barbados and Antigua, and by absentee landowners living in Britain. The worst violence took place on St. Kitts and Nevis, with rioting and blockage of stamp delivery. Montserrat and Antigua also succeeded in avoiding the use of stamps. In Jamaica there was also vocal opposition, and much evasion of the stamps. British merchants and manufacturers, whose exports to the colonies were threatened by colonial boycotts, also pressured Parliament.\n\nThe act was repealed in early 1766, although the Declaratory Act maintained Parliament's right to tax the colonies.\n\n\"Revenue stamps\" were revived in the United States during the American Civil War. In 1862, the United States (Union) government began taxing a variety of goods, services, and legal dealings, in an effort to raise revenue for the great costs of the war. To confirm that taxes were paid a \"revenue stamp\" was purchased and appropriately affixed to the taxable item. This excise tax continued until the federal government finished paying the war debt in 1883, at which time the tax was repealed.\n\nIn 1898, revenue stamps were again issued, to provide funding for the Spanish–American War. Tax was levied on a wide range of goods and services including alcohol, tobacco, tea, and other amusements and also on various legal and business transactions such as stock certificates, bills of lading, manifests, and marine insurance. To pay these tax duties revenue tax stamps were purchased and affixed to the taxable item or respective certificate.\n\nRevenue stamps were issued at irregular intervals for alcohol products, tobacco products, matches, proprietary medicines, and perfumes. Revenue stamps were finally discontinued on December 31, 1967.\n"}
{"id": "4347189", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4347189", "title": "Suspect classification", "text": "Suspect classification\n\nIn American jurisprudence, a suspect classification is any classification of groups meeting a series of criteria suggesting they are likely the subject of discrimination. These classes receive closer scrutiny by courts when an Equal Protection claim alleging unconstitutional discrimination is asserted against a law, regulation, or other government action, or sometimes private action.\n\nStrict scrutiny is applied to government actions that affect groups that fall under a \"suspect classification.\" The US Supreme Court has mentioned a variety of criteria that, in some combination, may qualify a group as a suspect classification, but the Court has not declared that any particular set of criteria are either necessary or sufficient to qualify.\n\nSome of the criteria that have been cited include:\n\nThe Supreme Court established the judicial precedent for suspect classifications in the cases of \"Hirabayashi v. United States\", 320 U.S. 81 and \"Korematsu v. United States\", 323 U.S. 214 (1944). The Supreme Court recognizes race, national origin, religion and alienage as suspect classes; it therefore analyzes any government action that discriminates against these classes under strict scrutiny.\n\nIn \"Perry v. Schwarzenegger\", the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in its Findings of Fact commented that sexual orientation could be considered a suspect class but, on the facts presented Proposition 8 failed even to satisfy the much more deferential rational basis review. The U.S. District Court for the District of Nebraska held the same in \"Citizens for Equal Protection v. Bruning\", but was reversed on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.\n\nAs the law currently stands, neither sexual orientation nor gender identity is considered a federal suspect class, although many states do consider them such. \n\nAlienage, or the state of being an alien, i.e. a non-citizen of the United States, is a unique category. For purposes of state law, legal aliens are a suspect class (\"Graham v. Richardson\", 403 U.S. 365 (1971)). As such, state actions are analyzed according to strict scrutiny. In contrast, because the United States Congress has the power to regulate immigration, federal government action that discriminates based on alienage will receive rational basis scrutiny. State acts that affect unlawful immigrants are generally analyzed with rational basis review unless the topic is education of children, in which case they are analyzed under intermediate scrutiny based on \"Plyler v. Doe\", 457 U.S. 202 (1982).\n\nIntermediate scrutiny is applied to groups that fall under a \"quasi-suspect classification.\" Gender and legitimacy of birth have been held to be quasi-suspect classes. In 2012, the U.S. District Court for \nNorthern California discussed this type of classification, but applied heightened scrutiny without specifically labeling gays and lesbians a suspect or quasi-suspect class in its decision. Striking down Section 3 of DOMA as unconstitutional in \"Windsor v. United States\" (2012), the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals held sexual orientation to be a quasi-suspect classification, and determined that laws that classify people on such basis should be subject to intermediate scrutiny. It was the first time a federal court had applied quasi-suspect classification in a sexual orientation case. The Supreme Court however has not decided whether sexual orientation fits into any identified class.\n\nRational basis scrutiny is applied to all other discriminatory statutes. Rational basis scrutiny currently covers all other discriminatory criteria—\"e.g.\", age, disability, wealth, political preference, political affiliation, or felons.\n\nTo satisfy the strict scrutiny, suspect classifications such as race, alienage, or national origin must be necessary to promote a compelling state interest when there is no less restrictive alternative method available to accomplish the government (state's) interest.\n\nThe practical result of this legal doctrine is that government sponsored discrimination on the account of a citizen's race, skin color, ethnicity, religion, or national origin is almost always unconstitutional, unless it is a compelling, narrowly tailored and temporary piece of legislation dealing with national security, defense, or affirmative action. \"Korematsu v. United States\", regarding Japanese internment, and \"Grutter v. Bollinger\", upholding affirmative action based upon racial diversity, are the only cases in which a racially discriminatory law has been upheld under the strict scrutiny test.\n\nStrict scrutiny is also applied to restrictions of any fundamental right, regardless of the group involved.\n\nWhen intermediate scrutiny is involved, the courts are more likely to oppose the discriminatory law when compared to a rational basis review particularly if a law is based on gender. However, a court will likely uphold a discriminatory law under intermediate scrutiny if the law has an exceedingly persuasive justification and applies to real, fact-based, or biological differences between the sexes. Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan, 102 S.Ct. 3331 (1982), Nguyen v. INS, 121 S.Ct. 2053 (2001).\n\nWhen rational basis review is used, it means that the classification is one that overwhelmingly tends to be rational, e.g. distinguishing criminals from non-criminals. This leads to wide political discretion and a focus of judicial resources to other cases where the classification employed tends to be more suspicious, and thus close judicial balancing is needed.\n\nThe Supreme Court's holdings impose a minimum standard to which each State must adhere. Hence, a State law that discriminates against citizens because of their race, must be reviewed by the applicable State and inferior federal courts using the strict scrutiny basis of review. A State may, generally, choose to give its citizens more rights or protections than the minimum federal standard when considering state law. For example, in 2008 the Supreme Court of California used the strict scrutiny basis of review to strike down a California statute denying legal recognition of same-sex marriages.\n\nCalifornia classifies sexual orientation as a suspect class under state law. Connecticut and Iowa classify sexual orientation as a quasi-suspect class under their respective state laws.\n"}

If the contestant successfully avoided the police, he won the car. The car chase was done in the real Moscow streets, and had to obey traffic laws. At its peak, the show had 60 million viewers per episode.\n\nThe show was created with the cooperation of the Russian police, and the police chasing the \"thief\" were real officers.

{"id": "52201540", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52201540", "title": "Treaty of Tsarskoye Selo", "text": "Treaty of Tsarskoye Selo\n\nThe Treaty of Tsarskoye Selo was a territorial and dynastic treaty between the Russian Empire and the Kingdom of Denmark. Signed on 1 June 1773, it transferred control of ducal Schleswig-Holstein to the Danish crown in return for Russian control of the County of Oldenburg and adjacent lands within the Holy Roman Empire. The treaty reduced the fragmentation of Danish territory and led to an alliance—The Eternal Alliance ()—between Denmark and Russia that lasted into the Napoleonic Wars, effectively ending in 1809, when Russian diplomats suggested to Sweden that Norway be a possible compensation for Finland.\n\nIn 1448 the Count of Oldenburg was elected King of Denmark and took the throne as Christian I. He assigned Oldenburg to his brother, Gerhard, in 1454, and that brother's descendants in the House of Oldenburg continued to rule the county for the next two centuries. For supporting him in the Schmalkaldic War, Emperor Charles V gave the Oldenburgers control of the town of Delmenhorst, which adjoins Oldenburg on the left bank of the Weser, in 1547. After Count Anthony Günther died childless in 1667, these territories began to be ruled by the kings of Denmark in personal union.\n\nIn 1460, upon his election as Duke of Holstein, King Christian I promulgated the Treaty of Ribe, affirming that Schleswig (a Danish fief) and Holstein (part of the Holy Roman Empire) were to remain \"forever undivided\" in return for his recognition by the region's noble estates as the rightful ruler of Schleswig-Holstein. From that time forward, Denmark and Schleswig-Holstein were ruled in personal union by the Danish kings for nearly a century. Then, in 1544 King Christian III of Denmark partitioned the two duchies between himself and his two half-brothers, John and Adolf, in an unusual way that would shape Danish politics for centuries.\n\nSchleswig-Holstein's noble estates remained opposed to the actual division of the region, so the revenues of the duchies were divided into three equal shares by assigning the revenues of particular areas and landed estates to particular brothers. The piecemeal assignment of the estates left Holstein and Schleswig with a patchwork of political boundaries, inhibiting any future separation of the regions, as intended by the estates. The rule in the duchies thus became a condominium of the king and the two dukes. Duke John died childless, and his share in the region was divided between his brothers' lines, but Duke Adolf's descendants in the House of Holstein-Gottorp, who ruled not only the ducal share of Schleswig-Holstein but also the Prince-Bishopric of Lübeck, became rivals to the Danish kings.\n\nBy the mid-17th century the so-called \"Gottorp Question\" of Holstein's relationship with the crown threatened the stability of the Danish kingdom, as the dukes of Holstein-Gottorp allied themselves with Sweden and other foreign powers against Denmark. During the minority of Duke Charles Frederick, Schleswig-Holstein's government affairs were entrusted to Minister Georg Heinrich von Görtz, who supported Sweden in the Great Northern War; in that war's aftermath, Denmark seized the duke's territory in Schleswig and ended Sweden's patronage of Holstein-Gottorp with the 1720 Treaty of Frederiksborg.\n\nDuke Charles Frederick, now only of Holstein-Gottorp, sought support for the recovery of Schleswig in Russia, and in 1725 he married Tsarevna Anna, the daughter of Tsar Peter the Great and sister of Tsarina Elizabeth of Russia. In 1742 the childless Empress Elizabeth appointed her nephew, Charles Peter Ulrich (Charles Frederick and Anna's son), to be her successor in Russia. After her death in 1762, this Duke of Holstein ascended the throne as Tsar Peter III of Russia; Holstein was now ruled in personal union by the Emperor of Russia.\n\nPeter, now both Duke of Holstein-Gottorp and Russian Emperor, dispatched minister Caspar von Saldern to the Danish court to demand the recovery of his former ducal territory in Schleswig. At the time of Peter's accession Russia was already fighting in the Seven Years' War, but he directed troops into Pomerania to threaten war against Denmark if Schleswig were not restored. The Danish government under Johann Hartwig Ernst von Bernstorff refused to relinquish Schleswig, and Russian and Danish troops faced off in Mecklenburg; but, on 9 July 1762, before fighting began or any agreement could be reached, Peter was overthrown by his wife, who took control of Russia as Tsarina Catherine II.\n\nEmpress Catherine reversed Russia's stance, withdrawing her husband's ultimatum and even entering an alliance with Denmark in 1765. She transferred the Duchy of Holstein to her minor son, Grand Duke Paul (later Tsar Paul I of Russia), and instructed her representative, von Saldern, to negotiate a peaceful solution to the Schleswig-Holstein conflict with his Danish counterpart, Foreign Minister Andreas Peter Bernstorff. The negotiators reached a provisional agreement in 1767.\n\nGrand Duke Paul would renounce the House of Romanov's claims in Schleswig-Holstein and transfer the ducal lands in Holstein to King Christian VII of Denmark, ending the Duchy of Holstein-Gottorp; in return Denmark would reaffirm its alliance with Russia, pay a sizable indemnity, and give Paul control of the County of Oldenburg and other hereditary Oldenburg lands in the Holy Roman Empire. The agreement was accepted by Catherine in 1767; after he came of age, Grand Duke Paul ratified the treaty on 1 June 1773 at the Russian imperial family's residence in Tsarskoye Selo, south of Saint Petersburg. On 12 August Russia and Denmark signed a further treaty of alliance against Sweden, and the bargain was complete.\n\nThe territorial exchange placed the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein under a single sovereign, the Danish King, and ended the political and dynastic conflicts that had divided the region since its partition two centuries earlier. The establishment of full, direct control over this strategically significant borderland strengthened Denmark's geopolitical position considerably and marked a major step toward Denmark's emergence as a centralized, unitary state. The treaty of alliance which shortly followed tied Denmark's foreign policy to Russia's and led directly to Danish involvement in the Theatre War of 1788–1789 and the Dano-Swedish War of 1808–09.\n\nOn the Russian side, the exchange allowed Catherine to turn Denmark from an enemy into an ally, furthering Nikita Ivanovich Panin's policy of building a Northern Accord to balance the power of Bourbon France; a stronger Denmark would also help to contain Sweden (Russia's chief rival in the Baltic Sea region). In 1774, Grand Duke Paul (at the urging of his mother) transferred the German lands obtained from the exchange to his great-uncle, Frederick August, and in 1777 they were united within a newly declared Duchy of Oldenburg. The Duchy of Oldenburg would remain connected to the Russian Empire until its annexation by Napoleon's French Empire in 1810.\n\n"}

He was nominated with only a plurality of votes in the Republican primary (2982 votes, to 2679 for Ervin Schneeberg and 613 for Henry Gefke); but had less trouble in the general election, defeating Democrat Stanley Lieberman by 15,685 to 6778.
