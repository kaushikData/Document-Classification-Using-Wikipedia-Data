Previous armistices had been agreed with Bulgaria, the Ottoman Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Also known as the Armistice of Compiègne from the place where it was signed at 5:45 a.m. by the French Marshal Foch, it came into force at 11 a.m. Paris time on 11 November 1918 (\"the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month\") and marked a victory for the Allies and a defeat for Germany, although not formally a surrender.\n\nThe actual terms, largely written by the Allied Supreme Commander, Marshal Ferdinand Foch, included the cessation of hostilities, the withdrawal of German forces to behind the Rhine, Allied occupation of the Rhineland and bridgeheads further east, the preservation of infrastructure, the surrender of aircraft, warships, and military materiel, the release of Allied prisoners of war and interned civilians, eventual reparations, no release of German prisoners and no relaxation of the naval blockade of Germany.\n\nAlthough the armistice ended the fighting, it needed to be prolonged three times until the Treaty of Versailles, which was signed on 28 June 1919, took effect on 10 January 1920.\n\nOn 29 September 1918 the German Supreme Army Command informed Kaiser Wilhelm II and the Imperial Chancellor, Count Georg von Hertling at Imperial Army Headquarters in Spa of occupied Belgium, that the military situation facing Germany was hopeless. Quartermaster General Erich Ludendorff, probably fearing a breakthrough, claimed that he could not guarantee that the front would hold for another two hours and demanded a request be given to the Entente for an immediate ceasefire. In addition, he recommended the acceptance of the main demands of US president Woodrow Wilson (the Fourteen Points) including putting the Imperial Government on a democratic footing, hoping for more favorable peace terms. This enabled him to save the face of the Imperial German Army and put the responsibility for the capitulation and its consequences squarely into the hands of the democratic parties and the parliament. He expressed his view to officers of his staff on 1 October: \"They now must lie on the bed that they've made for us.\"\n\nOn 3 October, the liberal Prince Maximilian of Baden was appointed Chancellor of Germany (prime minister), replacing Georg von Hertling in order to negotiate an armistice. After long conversations with the Kaiser and evaluations of the political and military situations in the Reich, by 5 October 1918, the German government sent a message to President Wilson to negotiate terms on the basis of a recent speech of his and the earlier declared \"Fourteen Points\". In the subsequent two exchanges, Wilson's allusions \"failed to convey the idea that the Kaiser's abdication was an essential condition for peace. The leading statesmen of the Reich were not yet ready to contemplate such a monstrous possibility.\" As a precondition for negotiations, Wilson demanded the retreat of Germany from all occupied territories, the cessation of submarine activities and the Kaiser's abdication, writing on 23 October: \"If the Government of the United States must deal with the military masters and the monarchical autocrats of Germany now, or if it is likely to have to deal with them later in regard to the international obligations of the German Empire, it must demand not peace negotiations but surrender.\"\n\nIn late October, Ludendorff, in a sudden change of mind, declared the conditions of the Allies unacceptable. He now demanded to resume the war which he himself had declared lost only one month earlier. However the German soldiers were pressing to get home. It was scarcely possible to arouse their readiness for battle anew, and desertions were on the increase. The Imperial Government stayed on course and Ludendorff was replaced by Wilhelm Groener. On 5 November, the Allies agreed to take up negotiations for a truce, now also demanding reparation payments.\n\nThe latest note from Wilson was received in Berlin on 6 November. That same day, the delegation led by Matthias Erzberger departed for France.\n\nA much bigger obstacle, which contributed to the five-week delay in the signing of the Armistice and to the resulting social deterioration in Europe, was the fact that the French, British and Italian governments had no desire to accept the \"Fourteen Points\" and President Wilson's subsequent promises. For example, they assumed that the de-militarization suggested by Wilson would be limited to the Central Powers. There were also contradictions with their post-War plans that did not include a consistent implementation of the ideal of national self-determination. As Czernin points out:\n\nThe sailors' revolt which took place during the night of 29 to 30 October 1918 in the naval port of Wilhelmshaven spread across the whole country within days and led to the proclamation of a republic on 9 November 1918 and to the announcement of the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II.\nHowever in various areas soldiers challenged the authority of their officers and on occasion established Soldiers' Councils. Thus for example the Brussels Soldiers' Council was set up by revolutionary soldiers on 9 November 1918.\n\nAlso on 9 November, Max von Baden handed over the office of Chancellor to Friedrich Ebert, a Social Democrat. Ebert's SPD and Erzberger's Catholic Centre Party had enjoyed an uneasy relationship with the Imperial government since Bismarck's era in the 1870s and 1880s. They were well represented in the Imperial Reichstag, which had little power over the government, and had been calling for a negotiated peace since 1917. Their prominence in the peace negotiations would cause the new Weimar Republic to lack legitimacy in right-wing and militarist eyes.\n\nThe Armistice was the result of a hurried and desperate process. The German delegation headed by Matthias Erzberger crossed the front line in five cars and was escorted for ten hours across the devastated war zone of Northern France, arriving on the morning of 8 November. They were then taken to the secret destination aboard Ferdinand Foch's private train parked in a railway siding in the forest of Compiègne.\n\nFoch appeared only twice in the three days of negotiations: on the first day, to ask the German delegation what they wanted, and on the last day, to see to the signatures. The Germans were handed the list of Allied demands and given 72 hours to agree. The German delegation discussed the Allied terms not with Foch, but with other French and Allied officers. The Armistice amounted to complete German demilitarization (see list below), with few promises made by the Allies in return. The naval blockade of Germany was not completely lifted until complete peace terms could be agreed upon.\n\nThere was no question of negotiation. The Germans were able to correct a few impossible demands (for example, the decommissioning of more submarines than their fleet possessed), extended the schedule for the withdrawal and registered their formal protest at the harshness of Allied terms. But they were in no position to refuse to sign. On Sunday 10 November, they were shown newspapers from Paris to inform them that the Kaiser had abdicated. That same day, Ebert instructed Erzberger to sign. The cabinet had earlier received a message from Hindenburg, requesting that the armistice be signed even if the Allied conditions could not be improved on.\n\nThe Armistice was agreed upon at 5:00 a.m. on 11 November, to come into effect at 11:00 a.m. Paris time (noon German time), for which reason the occasion is sometimes referred to as \"the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month\". Signatures were made between 5:12 a.m. and 5:20 a.m., Paris time.\n\nThe occupation of the Rhineland took place following the Armistice. The occupying armies consisted of American, Belgian, British, and French forces.\n\nThe Armistice was prolonged three times before peace was finally ratified. During this period it was also developed.\nPeace was ratified at 4:15 p.m. on 10 January 1920.\n\nFor the Allies, the personnel involved were all military. The two signatories were:\nOther members of the delegation included:\n\nFor Germany, the four signatories were:\n\nAmong its 34 clauses, the armistice contained the following major points:\n\nA. Western Front\n\n\nB. Eastern and African Fronts\n\n\nC. At sea\n\n\nD. General\n\n\nThe British public was notified of the armistice by a subjoined official communiqué issued from the Press Bureau at 10:20 a.m., when British Prime Minister David Lloyd George announced: \"The armistice was signed at five o'clock this morning, and hostilities are to cease on all fronts at 11 a.m. to-day.\" An official communique was published by the United States at 2:30 pm: \"In accordance with the terms of the Armistice, hostilities on the fronts of the American armies were suspended at eleven o'clock this morning.\"\n\nNews of the armistice being signed was officially announced towards 9 a.m. in Paris. One hour later, Foch, accompanied by a British admiral, presented himself at the Ministry of War, where he was immediately received by Georges Clemenceau, the Prime Minister of France. At 10:50 a.m., Foch issued this general order: \"Hostilities will cease on the whole front as from November 11 at 11 o'clock French time The Allied troops will not, until further order, go beyond the line reached on that date and at that hour.\" Five minutes later, Clemenceau, Foch and the British admiral went to the Élysée Palace. At the first shot fired from the Eiffel Tower, the Ministry of War and the Élysée Palace displayed flags, while bells around Paris rang. Five hundred students gathered in front of the Ministry and called upon Clemenceau, who appeared on the balcony. Clemenceau exclaimed \"Vive la France!\"—the crowd echoed him. At 11:00 a.m., the first peace-gunshot was fired from Fort Mont-Valérien, which told the population of Paris that the armistice was concluded, but the population were already aware of it from official circles and newspapers.\n\nAlthough the information about the imminent ceasefire had spread among the forces at the front in the hours before, fighting in many sections of the front continued right until the appointed hour. At 11 a.m. there was some spontaneous fraternization between the two sides. But in general, reactions were muted. A British corporal reported: \"...the Germans came from their trenches, bowed to us and then went away. That was it. There was nothing with which we could celebrate, except cookies.\" On the Allied side, euphoria and exultation were rare. There was some cheering and applause, but the dominant feeling was silence and emptiness after 52 exhausting months of war.\n\nThe peace between the Allies and Germany was subsequently settled in 1919, by the Paris Peace Conference and the Treaty of Versailles that same year.\n\nMany artillery units continued to fire on German targets to avoid having to haul away their spare ammunition. The Allies also wished to ensure that, should fighting restart, they would be in the most favourable position. Consequently, there were 10,944 casualties, of whom 2,738 men died, on the last day of the war.\n\nAn example of the determination of the Allies to maintain pressure until the last minute, but also to adhere strictly to the Armistice terms, was Battery 4 of the US Navy's long-range 14-inch railway guns firing its last shot at 10:57:30 am from the Verdun area, timed to land far behind the German front line just before the scheduled Armistice.\n\nAugustin Trébuchon was the last Frenchman to die when he was shot on his way to tell fellow soldiers, who were attempting an assault across the Meuse river, that hot soup would be served after the ceasefire. He was killed at 10:45 a.m.\n\nEarlier, the last soldier from the UK to die, George Edwin Ellison of the 5th Royal Irish Lancers, was killed that morning at around 9:30 a.m. while scouting on the outskirts of Mons, Belgium.\n\nThe final Canadian, and Commonwealth, soldier to die, Private George Lawrence Price, was shot and killed by a sniper while part of a force advancing into the Belgian town of Ville-sur-Haine just two minutes before the armistice to the north of Mons at 10:58 a.m., to be recognized as one of the last killed with a monument to his name.\n\nHenry Gunther, an American, is generally recognized as the last soldier killed in action in World War I. He was killed 60 seconds before the armistice came into force while charging astonished German troops who were aware the Armistice was nearly upon them. He had been despondent over his recent reduction in rank and was apparently trying to redeem his reputation.\n\nNews of the armistice only reached African forces, the King's African Rifles, still fighting with great success in today's Zambia about a fortnight later. The German and British commanders then had to agree on the protocols for their own armistice ceremony.<br>\n\nCelebration of the Armistice became the centrepiece of memories of the war, along with salutes to the unknown soldier. Nations built monuments to the dead and the heroic soldiers, but seldom to the generals and admirals. 11 November is commemorated annually in many countries under various names such as Armistice Day, Remembrance Day, Veterans Day, and in Poland it is Independence Day.\n\nThe end of the Second World War in China (end of the Second Sino-Japanese War) formally took place on 9 September 1945 at 9:00 (the ninth hour of the ninth day of the ninth month). The date was chosen in echo of the Armistice of 11 November 1918 (on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month); and because \"nine\" is homophone of the word for \"long lasting\" in Chinese (to suggest that the peace won would last forever).\n\nThe myth that the German Army was stabbed in the back, by the Social Democratic government that was formed in November 1918, was created by reviews in the German press that grossly misrepresented British Major-General Frederick Maurice's book, \"The Last Four Months\". \"Ludendorff made use of the reviews to convince Hindenburg.\"\n\n\nInformational notes\nCitations\nBibliography\n\nFurther reading\n"}
{"id": "705899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=705899", "title": "Attainder", "text": "Attainder\n\nIn English criminal law, attainder or attinctura was the metaphorical \"stain\" or \"corruption of blood\" which arose from being condemned for a serious capital crime (felony or treason). It entailed losing not only one's life, property and hereditary titles, but typically also the right to pass them on to one's heirs. Both men and women condemned of capital crimes could be attainted.\n\nAttainder by confession resulted from a guilty plea at the bar before judges or before the coroner in sanctuary. Attainder by verdict resulted from conviction by jury. Attainder by process resulted from a legislative act outlawing a fugitive. The last form is obsolete in England (and prohibited in the United States), and the other forms have been abolished.\n\nMedieval and Renaissance English monarchs used acts of attainder to deprive nobles of their lands and often their lives. Once attainted, the descendants of the noble could no longer inherit his lands or income. Attainder essentially amounted to the legal death of the attainted's family.\n\nMonarchs typically used attainders against political enemies and those who posed potential threats to the king's position and security. The attainder eliminated any advantage the noble would have in a court of law; nobles were exempt from many of the techniques used to try commoners, including torture. Likewise, in many cases of attainder, the king could coerce the parliament into approving the attainder and there would be a lower or non-existent burden of proof (evidence) than there would be in court.\n\nPrior to the Tudors, most rulers reversed their attainders in return for promises of loyalty. For example, Henry VI reversed all 21 attainders, Edward IV 86 of 120, and Richard III 99 of 100. However, this changed with Henry VII, as described below.\n\nRegnants who used attainder include:\n\n\n\nOnce attainted, nobles were considered commoners, and as such, could be subjected to the same treatments, including torture and methods of execution. For example, commoners could be burned at the stake, whereas nobles could not.\n\nOften, nobles would refer to the act of being attainted (and then executed) as the person's \"destruction\".\n\nIn the Westminster system, a bill of attainder is a bill passed by Parliament to attaint persons who are accused of high treason, or, in rare cases, a lesser crime. A person attainted need not have been convicted of treason in a court of law; in fact, the attainder process is a method of declaring a person a fugitive.\n\nA rumour circulated that a bill of attainder against Thomas Jefferson occurred in 1774 because of his authorship of \"A Summary View of the Rights of British America\".\n\nA bill of attainder was last passed in Britain in 1798, against Lord Edward FitzGerald. Attainders by confession, verdict and process were abolished in the United Kingdom by the Forfeiture Act 1870 (33 & 34 Vict., c.23).\n\nSection 9 of Article One of the United States Constitution provides that no bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed by Congress. The following section forbids states from passing them.\n\nCorruption of blood is one of the consequences of attainder. The descendants of an attainted person could not inherit either from the attainted person (whose property had been forfeited by the attainder) or from their other relatives through him. For example, if a person is executed for a crime leaving innocent children, the property of the criminal is forfeited to the crown and will not pass to the children. If the criminal's innocent father subsequently dies, the property inherited by the criminal from the father cannot be inherited by the criminal's children either: it will be distributed among other family members.\n\nThe United States Constitution prohibits corruption of blood as a punishment for treason. In England and Wales corruption of blood has been abolished.\n\n"}

The law commenced on 1 January 2011, replacing 20 different consumer laws across the Commonwealth and the states and territories, although certain other Acts continue to be in force.\n\nThe Australian Consumer Law was developed by agreement of the Council of Australian Governments.\n\nThe provisions of the Australian Consumer Law broadly reflects the provisions previously afforded by the \"Trade Practices Act 1974\", although some additional protections have been added. The Australian Consumer Law also generally reflects most of the consumer protection provisions of the fair trading legislation in each state and territory.\n\nThe ACL has a broad definition as to who is a \"consumer\", and it includes anyone who acquires:\n\nA person is still defined as a \"consumer\" if the good was acquired for purposes of re-supply or for the purpose of using or transforming it in trade or commerce. It accordingly extends protections relating to business behaviour, product safety and quality to businesses and farms with regard to the areas covered above.\n\nCertain provisions possess different scope in their application:\n\nThese provisions are vigorously enforced. In December 2014, the Federal Court of Australia, on the application of the ACCC, issued a $10 million pecuniary penalty order against Coles Supermarkets in relation to two connected proceedings arising from payment demands by Coles to which it was not entitled by threatening harm to the suppliers that did not comply with such demands.\n\nThe ACL is administered and enforced jointly by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the State and Territory consumer protection agencies, with the involvement of Australian Securities and Investment Commission on financial services matters.\n\nThe following matters are regulated federally, by virtue of the corporations power:\n\nFederal jurisdiction also extends to conduct outside Australia by bodies corporate incorporated or carrying on business in Australia, Australian citizens, and persons ordinarily resident in Australia.\n\nAll other matters subject to the ACL are handled by the States.\n\nImplementing identical consumer protection laws at Commonwealth and state/territory levels promotes consistency between jurisdictions. It will also make it easier for the Federal Parliament to amend the provisions which will then be reflected in the laws of the states and territories without the parliaments of each jurisdiction needing to debate and enact the amendments separately, although the states and territories reserve the right not to implement any amendments within their own jurisdiction.\n\n"}

For current practice, as well as a discussion of similar processes in other churches, see the article on canonization. This article describes the process as it was in 1914, before the promulgation of the \"Codex Iuris Canonici\" (\"Code of Canon Law\") of 1983.\n\nThe causes of martyrs were considered somewhat differently from those of confessors, for some points of the process.\n\nTill later the Second Vatican Council, the conclusive act of the canon practice and procedure of canonization, were:\nThe Saint shall Church Consecrated with his name, or be prayed as the intercessor during a Votive Mass.\n\nIn order to secure beatification, the most important and difficult step in the process of canonization, the regular procedure was as follows:\n\n\n\nThis procedure was followed in all cases of formal beatification in causes of both confessors and martyrs proposed in the ordinary way (\"per viam non cultus\"). Those proposed as coming under the definition of cases excepted (\"casus excepti\"\") by Pope Urban VIII were treated differently. In such cases proof is required that an immemorial public veneration for at least 100 years before the promulgation in 1640 of the decrees of Pope Urban VIII had been paid the servant of God, whether as a confessor or martyr. Such cause was proposed under the title of \"confirmation of veneration\" (\"de confirmatione cultus\"); it was considered in an ordinary meeting of the Congregation of Rites. When the difficulties of the Promotor of the Faith had been satisfied, a Pontifical decree confirming the \"cultus\" was promulgated. Beatification of this kind was denominated \"equivalent\" or \"virtual\".\n\nThe canonization of confessors or martyrs might be taken up as soon as two miracles were reported to have been worked at their intercession, after the pontifical permission of public veneration as described above. At this stage it was only required that the two miracles worked after the permission awarding a public cultus be discussed in three meetings of the congregation. The discussion proceeded in the ordinary way; if the miracles were confirmed, another meeting (\"super tuto\") was held. The pope then issued a Bull of Canonization in which he not only permitted, but commanded, the public cultus, or veneration, of the saint.\n\nIt may be easily conjectured that considerable time must elapse before any cause of beatification or canonization could be conducted, from the first steps of the information, inquiry, or process, to the issuing of the decree super tuto. According to the constitution of this Congregation, more than one important discussion (\"dubia maiora\") could not be proposed at the same time. It must be remembered:\n\n\nTo execute all this business there was but one weekly meeting (\"congressus\"), a kind of minor congregation in which only the cardinal prefect and the major officials voted; in it less important and practical questions were settled regarding rites as well as causes, and answers were given, and rescripts which the Pope afterwards verbally approved. The other meetings of the congregation (ordinary, rotal, and \"upon virtues and miracles\") might be as few as sixteen in the course of the year. Some other cause must therefore be found for the slow progress of causes of beatification or canonization than a lack of good will or activity on the part of the Congregation of Rites.\n\n"}

The act provides that unclaimed bodies of dead persons cast ashore from the sea should be removed by the churchwardens and overseers of the parish, and decently interred in consecrated ground.\n\nThe passage of the 1808 act was one of the consequences of the wreck of the Royal Navy frigate HMS \"Anson\" in Mount's Bay in 1807. Prior to the passage of this act it was customary to unceremoniously bury drowned seamen without shroud or coffin and in unconsecrated ground. However the burial in this manner of the many dead from the \"Anson\", and the length of time that many of the bodies remained unburied, caused controversy and led to a local solicitor, Thomas Grylls, drafting a new law to provide more decent treatment for drowned seamen. This law was introduced to parliament by John Hearle Tremayne, Member of Parliament for Cornwall, and was enacted in 1808.\n\nA monument to the drowned sailors, and to the passing of Grylls' Act, stands near the entrance to the harbour of Porthleven. The construction of this harbour was another of the consequences of the loss of the \"Anson\".\n\nThis act was amended by the Burial of Drowned Persons Act 1886 (citation \"49 & 50 Vict c.20\"), to extend its applicability to bodies found in, or cast on shore from, all tidal or navigable waters. This was needed following the case of the wreck of the Princess Alice, when various parishes refused to pay the cost of interment. The parish was responsible for burial, under the Burial of Drowned Persons Act, and a fee of 5 shillings (a crown) was also paid by the parish for the recovery of drowned bodies.\n"}

{"id": "28020276", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28020276", "title": "Case bond", "text": "Case bond\n\nA case bond is an investment in a legal claim.\n\nMore specifically, it is a non-recourse purchase of an assignment interest in a legal cause of action. A case bond provides a litigant with money prior to a monetary recovery. In return, the case bond accrues fees until there is a recovery which triggers the satisfaction of the assignment interest. If there is no recovery in the underlying claim or lawsuit the case bond self terminates and the obligation to satisfy its terms expire. Typically, case bonds are used by litigants to cover the costs of daily living expenses, medical bills and litigation costs.\n\nThis investment vehicle was first developed in the late 1990s due to the need for funding to claimants in lawsuits prior to a recovery due to the extended lengths of time involved with litigation. A case bond is a type of structured investment product; it varies in size based on the anticipated value of a potential resolution in a pending lawsuit or claim securitized solely by any proceeds recovered.\n\nHistorically, a third party investing in a lawsuit was a problem.\n\nIn the Common law of England, the practice of financing lawsuits was connected with champerty and maintenance, which was a practice whereby the investor would become involved in the lawsuit. Lawsuits were won through intimidation and other methods rather than the merit of the case.\n\nEnglish common law was incorporated into the statutes of many states, thus the states inherited the rules prohibiting this practice. However, the definition of Champerty and/or Maintenance differs between states. In many states, it is no longer part of the law, in favor of existing laws regarding legal fees and recognizing existing laws regarding investment and financing in general. It is also important to note that in some instances, the retraction of these laws was due to the belief that the modern judicial system is not susceptible to the pressures exerted on medieval English judges.\n\nThe original laws stemmed from the fact that the third party would or could interfere with the justice system.\n\nIn a case bond, the third party does not get involved with the lawsuit at all. The purpose of the investor in a case bond is to allow the plaintiff to continue life without the requirement of a settlement due solely to a lack of funds (which is often the case). Historically in the US, the plaintiff has often been \"caught\" in a lawsuit that could be won or settled for a large figure, but simply cannot support him/herself long enough to see the lawsuit through to its end. In many cases a defendant has been aware of this situation and has relied upon it to coerce the plaintiff to settle for a much lower figure than would otherwise be possible.\n\nWith the present system of case bonds, there is a lack of \"urgency\" for the plaintiff to settle out of court for lower amounts than those they would owe based on the amount of the case bond already in force. For example: if a plaintiff were required to pay $10,000 to the case bond investor based on the contractual case bond amount, settling for less than $10,000 would not be possible. This creates a problem for the defendant and possibly even for the plaintiff's attorney if they are considering settling for a lower amount. So, the purpose of the case bond is to reduce the \"urgency\" or \"need\" of the plaintiff to settle for a lower amount.\n\nLawsuit venture capitalism is different from a case bond in that it occurs before the lawsuit begins. It is arguable that in many cases the lawsuit would not have been filed without the introduction of the 3rd party. A case bond requires that a case already be filed and \"underway\".\n\nLitigation funding is different from a case bond in that it is primarily used for support of the lawsuit itself, or related items such as expert fees and court fees. A case bond is only linked to the case by the simple nature of the possibility of payout at the end, should the case be successful. while litigation funding may or may not be dependent upon the outcome and may involve fee recovery being attached. Litigation funding may also be required in a case where a contingency fee-based attorney is not available.\n\nLegal finance is the category in which a case bond will be found. A case bond is one distinct type of legal finance or legal funding.\n\nMaintenance \"...is directed against those who, for an improper motive, often described as wanton or officious intermeddling, become involved with disputes (litigation) of others in which the maintainer has no interest whatsoever and where the assistance he or she renders to one or the other parties is without justification or excuse.\"\n\nChamperty \"...is an egregious form of maintenance in which there is the added element that the maintainer shares in the profits of the litigation. Importantly, without maintenance there can be no champerty.\"\n\nUnlike the above, a case bond is merely supplied, with no involvement on the part of the investor(s) in the bond (therefore there is no meddling).\n"}

The primary function of paralegals is to assist attorneys in the delivery of legal services. According to the American Bar Association: “A legal assistant or paralegal is a person, qualified by education, training and/or work experience who is employed or retained by a lawyer, law office, corporation, governmental agency or other entity and who performs specifically delegated substantive legal work for which a lawyer is responsible.” Because certification programs are voluntary in most states, a paralegal may find work in the field without obtaining certification. Additionally, requirements for certification may vary by state.\n\nIn the United States \"paralegal\" and \"legal assistant\" are frequently used interchangeably. At the August 1997 ABA Annual Meeting, the ABA's policy making body, the House of Delegates, adopted the current definition of \"legal assistant/paralegal\", as recommended by the Standing Committee on Legal Assistants. The current definition reads as follows: \"A legal assistant or paralegal is a person, qualified by education, training or work experience who is employed or retained by a lawyer, law office, corporation, governmental agency or other entity and who performs specifically delegated substantive legal work for which a lawyer is responsible.\n\nThe current definition of \"legal assistant/paralegal\" replaces the definition adopted by the ABA Board of Governors in 1986. It adds the term \"paralegal\" since the terms \"legal assistant\" and \"paralegal\" are, in practice, used interchangeably. The term that is preferred generally depends on what part of the country one is from. The current definition streamlines the 1986 definition and more accurately reflects how legal assistants are presently being utilized in the delivery of legal services.\" \n\nDespite the American Bar Association's position on this matter, there is no consensus in the legal field as a whole regarding the specific duties of paralegals/legal assistants and some law firms and legal departments still maintain paralegal and legal assistant as separate job titles.\n\nAccording to the American Bar Association, there is a distinction between \"certified\" paralegals and \"certificated\" paralegals and the terms are not interchangeable. Certified Paralegals have passed a professional exam and certificated paralegals have completed a paralegal program or other preparatory education through an academic institution. Certificated paralegals are generally eligible to take one of several certification exams after graduating from an approved paralegal program.\n\nOccasionally, paralegals mistakenly refer to themselves as an \"ABA Certified Paralegal\" in reference to the certificate that they were given upon completion of paralegal school. This is entirely different from certification. A certificate from paralegal school is a Certificate of Completion. The paralegal school these paralegals attended has been approved by the ABA. Out of approximately 1500 or so paralegal schools in the U.S., only about 280 have been approved by the ABA. The school must meet certain qualifications set down by the ABA and pay upfront and annual fees to maintain its approval status. When a student completes the 4 month, 2-year or 4-year program, they are given a certificate of completion but are not certified.*\n\nCP or CLA is the post-nominal credential in the United States earnedy by paralegals who have passed the Certified Paralegal Exam and have met up education and experience requirements for certification as a CP or CLA. The CP and CLA credential is recognized by the American Bar Association and State Bars.\n\nTo become a CP in the United States, the candidate voluntarily passes the Certified Paralegal Exam (CP Exam). The Certified Paralegal program - the oldest in the United States - was established in 1976 and is administered by the National Association of Legal Assistants (NALA). The CP designation is a certification duly registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (No. 78213275)\n\nThe term \"certified paralegal\" is not owned by NALA or any other organization (just as the term \"Certified Public Account\" is not owned by the various organizations that offer accountant certification). The term is not proprietary to NALA, only the certification mark is (image and mark information is available via the U.S. Patent Office: http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&state=4802:l0lqo1.2.1 and via NALA).\n\nAccording to Legal Assistant Today magazine, the CP Exam has a 45-50% pass rate.\n\nAfter a paralegal obtains the CP credential, he or she is eligible to participate in the Advanced Paralegal Certification program. The credential awarded after successful completion of the program is the \"ACP\" credential. A CP must complete an ACP course and pass an exam which demonstrates advanced knowledge in the specific practice area or areas of practice in which the course is taken \n\nThe National Federation of Paralegal Associations, or NFPA, offers two certification programs. Their Paralegal Advanced \nCompetency Exam (PACE®) was established in 1996. Their Paralegal CORE Competency Exam (PCCE™) was established in 2011. A paralegal who completes the certification process through the NFPA earns the credential Registered Paralegal (RP) for completion of the PACE Exam and Core Registered Paralegal (CRP) for completion of the PCCE Exam. The Paralegal CORE Competency Exam™ (PCCE™) was developed to assess the knowledge, skills and ability of early-career and entry-level paralegals. The PACE exam consists of hypothetical questions testing advanced application of general knowledge, paralegal experience, and critical analysis obtained only by a higher level of education and actual work experience. The RP and CRP credentials is recognized by the American Bar Association and State Bars.\n\nThe Association for Legal Professionals, or NALS, previously National Association of Legal Secretaries, offers the Professional Paralegal \nExam established in 2004. A paralegal who completes the certification process through NALS earns the credential Professional Paralegal (PP). The PP credential is recognized by the American Bar Association and State Bars.\n\nThe American Alliance of Paralegals (AAPI) awards the designation American Alliance Certified Paralegal (AACP). The AACP credential is recognized by the American Bar Association and State Bars.\n\nThe American Bar Association recognizes national certification set forth above and the voluntary state specific certifications of the:\n\n\nAlthough California does not certify paralegals in general, California legislation (AB 1761) makes it unlawful for persons to identify themselves as paralegals unless they meet certain requirements. Paralegals must also complete continuing legal education every two years in order to lawfully perform services or identify as a paralegal.\n\nA comparison chart for the various national level paralegal certifications is available on the NFPA website.\n\nAll certifying bodies require applicants to complete a special examination containing ethics to become certified. Most exams require the knowledge of the American Bar Association's Model Rules of Professional Conduct . NALA also has its own Code of Ethics and Professional Responsibility.\n\nAll certifying bodies require applicants to take continuing legal education courses in order to renew their certification. Credentials may be revoked from certified paralegals who fail to meet the recertification requirements. The paralegal must then retake the certifying exam again to use the credential.\n\n"}
{"id": "317425", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=317425", "title": "Circumstantial evidence", "text": "Circumstantial evidence\n\nCircumstantial evidence is evidence that relies on an inference to connect it to a conclusion of fact—such as a fingerprint at the scene of a crime. By contrast, direct evidence supports the truth of an assertion directly—i.e., without need for any additional evidence or inference.\n\nOn its own, circumstantial evidence allows for more than one explanation. Different pieces of circumstantial evidence may be required, so that each corroborates the conclusions drawn from the others. Together, they may more strongly support one particular inference over another. An explanation involving circumstantial evidence becomes more likely once alternative explanations have been ruled out.\n\nCircumstantial evidence allows a trier of fact to infer that a fact exists. In criminal law, the inference is made by the trier of fact in order to support the truth of an assertion (of guilt or absence of guilt).\n\nTestimony can be direct evidence or it can be circumstantial. For example, a witness saying that she saw a defendant stab a victim is providing direct evidence. By contrast, a witness who says that she saw the defendant enter a house, that she heard screaming, and that she saw the defendant leave with a bloody knife gives circumstantial evidence. It is the necessity for inference, and not the obviousness of a conclusion, that determines whether evidence is circumstantial.\n\nForensic evidence supplied by an expert witness is usually treated as circumstantial evidence. For example, a forensic scientist may provide results of ballistic tests proving that the defendant’s firearm fired the bullets that killed the victim, but not necessarily that the defendant fired the shots.\n\nCircumstantial evidence is especially important in civil and criminal cases where direct evidence is lacking. \n\nCircumstantial evidence is used in civil courts to establish or refute liability. It is usually the most common form of evidence, for example in product liability cases and road traffic accidents. Forensic analysis of skid marks can frequently allow a reconstruction of the accident. By measuring the length of such marks and using dynamic analysis of the car and road conditions at the time of the accident, it may be found that a driver underestimated his or her speed. Forensic science and forensic engineering are common as much in civil cases as in criminal.\n\nCircumstantial evidence is used in criminal courts to establish guilt or innocence through reasoning. \n\nWith obvious exceptions (immature, incompetent, or mentally ill individuals), most criminals try to avoid generating direct evidence. Hence, the prosecution usually must resort to circumstantial evidence to prove the existence of \"mens rea\", or intent. The same goes for the plaintiff's establishing the negligence of tortfeasors in tort law to recover damages from them.\n\nOne example of circumstantial evidence is the behavior of a person around the time of an alleged offense. In the case of someone charged with theft of money, were the suspect seen in a shopping spree purchasing expensive items shortly after the time of the alleged theft, the spree might prove to be circumstantial evidence of the individual's guilt.\n\nOther examples of circumstantial evidence are fingerprint analysis, blood analysis or DNA analysis of the evidence found at the scene of a crime. These types of evidence may strongly point to a certain conclusion when taken into consideration with other facts—but if not directly witnessed by someone when the crime was committed, they are still considered circumstantial. However, when proved by expert witnesses, they are usually sufficient to decide a case, especially in the absence of any direct evidence. Owing to subsequent developments in forensic methods, old undecided cases (or cold cases) are frequently resolved.\n\nA popular misconception is that circumstantial evidence is less valid or less important than direct evidence. This is only partly true: direct evidence is popularly assumed to be the most powerful. Many successful criminal prosecutions rely largely or entirely on circumstantial evidence, and civil charges are frequently based on circumstantial or indirect evidence. \n\nIndeed, the common metaphor for the strongest possible evidence in any case—the \"smoking gun\"—is an example of proof based on circumstantial evidence. Similarly, fingerprint evidence, videotapes, sound recordings, photographs, and many other examples of physical evidence that support the drawing of an inference, i.e., circumstantial evidence, are considered very strong possible evidence.\n\nIn practice, circumstantial evidence can have an advantage over direct evidence in that it can come from multiple sources that check and reinforce each other. Eyewitness testimony can be inaccurate at times, and many persons have been convicted on the basis of perjured or otherwise mistaken testimony. Thus, strong circumstantial evidence can provide a more reliable basis for a verdict. Circumstantial evidence normally requires a witness, such as the police officer who found the evidence, or an expert who examined it, to lay the foundation for its admission. This witness, sometimes known as the sponsor or the authenticating witness, is giving direct (eyewitness) testimony, and could present credibility problems in the same way that any eyewitness does.\n\nEyewitness testimony is frequently unreliable, or subject to conflict or outright fabrication. For example, the RMS \"Titanic\" sank in the presence of approximately 700 witnesses. For many years, there was vigorous debate on whether the ship broke into two before sinking. It was not until the ship was found, in September 1985, that the truth was known.\n\nHowever, there is often more than one logical conclusion inferable from the same set of circumstances. In cases where one conclusion implies a defendant's guilt and another his innocence, the \"benefit of the doubt\" principle would apply. Indeed, if the circumstantial evidence suggests a possibility of innocence, the prosecution has the burden of disproving that possibility.\n\nMuch of the evidence against convicted Timothy McVeigh was circumstantial. Speaking about McVeigh's trial, Robert Precht said, \"the prosecution's use of indirect evidence is no cause for worry.\" The 2004 murder trial of Scott Peterson was another high-profile conviction based heavily on circumstantial evidence. Another case that relied on circumstantial evidence was that of Nelson Serrano. The 2015 murder trial of Ivan Chan Man-sum was a conviction based solely on circumstantial evidence without finding the body.\n\n"}
{"id": "5131785", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5131785", "title": "Damage waiver", "text": "Damage waiver\n\nDamage waiver or, as it is often referred to, collision damage waiver (CDW) or loss damage waiver (LDW), is optional damage insurance coverage that is available to you when you rent a car.\n\nCar rental companies treat the CDW as a waiver of their right to make the renter pay for damages to the car.\n\nIn many countries, it is a legal requirement to have CDW insurance included in the basic car rental rate. It covers the rented car. Some rental companies also offer liability insurance and coverage of towing charges. Terms and prices vary. Alternatives to the CDW include other car insurance policies, some coverage from credit card issuers (Visa, MasterCard, etc.) and some travel insurance.\n\nIf the car damages property or injures someone, the customer or other insurance must pay for the damages (i.e., is \"held liable\"). US car rental companies sometimes include minimum liability insurance required by law in the basic rental charge. Hertz includes it in all states except California, but will subrogate any damages against the driver (meaning the car is insured to the state minimum but the driver will pay for all damages paid by Hertz). Avis includes it in all states except California and Texas, at least for renters who lack their own coverage. Other companies do not publicize where they include liability insurance in the basic rental charge. Some car rental companies offer more liability insurance for a fee.\n\nWithin Canada, all auto rentals are required by law to include a minimum of $200,000 in third-party liability insurance, regardless of whether the renter has their own auto insurance or not. Most rental agencies thus do not provide a third-party liability insurance option, and simply factor in the premium as part of fixed cost of rental.\n\nWhen a customer does not pay the car rental company to waive damage, and a rented car is stolen, or damaged by accident, vandalism, weather (hail), etc., the customer or other insurance must pay to the rental company the full cost of repair, plus administrative charges and, in some states, loss of use. From some companies, in some states and countries, there are charges for towing, storage, impound, administrative fees and diminution of value of the car (Avis, Budget, National, Thrifty). Some companies even say they alone will decide the diminution (Dollar, Hertz\").\n\nThe rental company's damage waiver normally covers accidental damage and towing a damaged vehicle, as long as the renter complies with the rental contract (such as authorized drivers, locations, no racing) and with the damage waiver (such as police report). Waivers may also cover theft, vandalism, loss of use, and liability. The renter often has a choice among different coverages for different fees.\n\nDamage waivers are not necessarily complete. They may have deductibles (also called excess) and limits on the amount covered. Liability coverage always has limits.\n\nThe descriptions above come from rental company websites, under headings like Policies, FAQ, Coverage, or More.\nDamage Waivers can be bought from the car rental company in most countries, or through a car hire excess insurer in the UK, or through travel insurers. Coverage from the car rental company may be required if the renter lacks proof of coverage elsewhere.\n\nCDW meets the basic definition of insurance, since it transfers some risk from the car renter to the rental company. However rental companies do not call it insurance, since it is a waiver between the renter and the company. Rental companies are not licensed or regulated as insurers. There are also no claims made. Rental companies treat CDW as a waiver of their right to make the renter pay for damage to the vehicle.\n\nSome credit card issuers (Visa, MasterCard, etc.,) offer insurance for theft or damage to rented cars. A few of the cards (noted in the table below) offer \"primary\" insurance, so the driver does not need to file a claim with his or her personal insurance. More cards offer \"secondary insurance.\" This means that if the renter has personal or business vehicle insurance with appropriate coverage, then that insurance will pay first. Then the credit card issuer will pay the primary insurance's deductible and will address any large claims above the primary insurance limit.\n\nIf the renter has no other vehicle insurance for the specific claim (no insurance at all, or not in the relevant country, or no collision insurance, etc.), the credit card company (if it offers coverage) will pay the whole amount, up to its limits.\n\nAll four credit card companies listed below cover \"collision damage\" with some of their cards. Visa and some MasterCards and American Express cards also cover \"theft\", while other MasterCards and American Express cards include \"theft, vandalism, hitting a deer or chipping a window\" (sources at bottom of table).\n\nOther issues important to some renters are that Visa and MasterCard only cover rental contracts of \"15 days\" or less (not even the first 15 days of longer rentals). Some American Express and MasterCards are not useful on \"dirt or gravel roads\", since they exclude \"damage sustained on any surface, other than a bound surface such as concrete or tarmac\". \n\nMasterCard and Visa in the United States say they cover \"Physical damage and/or theft\", but an introductory paragraph for some MasterCards and all Visa cards limits this to \"collision or theft,\" so vandalism and hail are excluded. It may be ambiguous whether deer impacts and glass chips are covered as \"collisions.\" MasterCards from Bank of America and MBNA generally have a simpler opening paragraph, which leaves coverage in place for any physical damage.\n\nEven among these brands, some cards lack coverage entirely, especially debit cards and cards with low credit limits. The AmEx Platinum Cash Rebate card, for example, has no coverage. MasterCard \"Standard\" cards lack coverage, while \"Premier\", \"Gold\" and \"Platinum\" cards vary in their coverage. Citi® / AAdvantage®, Citi ThankYou®, Citi® Dividend or Citi CashReturns® MasterCard-branded cards are notable for providing coverage worldwide without geographic exclusions, while most other MasterCard, Visa and American Express cards exclude coverage in Ireland, Israel, Jamaica.\n\nThese schemes apply to cards issued in the US, Trinidad and Tobago, and apparently nowhere else. In addition, no credit card will cover a rental that is being billed to a third party, such as in the event that an insurance company is being directly billed for the rental.\n\nThe following table is an effort at a summary, though not guaranteed. Coverage is complex and changes periodically. Telephone staff do not know the changes. Formal insurance policies govern and are not easily available to cardholders, who are only given summaries, like the links below.\n\n\"Loss of use\" and administration fees are often advertised as covered by credit cards. However, credit card companies pay these items only if the rental car company provides proof. If rental car company does not provide proof, there seems little reason for the renter to pay either.\n\n"}

{"id": "4625207", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4625207", "title": "Deferred tax", "text": "Deferred tax\n\nA notional asset or liability to reflect corporate income taxation on a basis that is the same or more similar to recognition of profits than the taxation treatment. Deferred tax liabilities can arise as a result of corporate taxation treatment of capital expenditure being more rapid than the accounting depreciation treatment. Deferred tax assets can arise due to net loss carry-overs, which are only recorded as asset if it is deemed more likely than not that the asset will be used in future fiscal periods. Different countries may also allow or require discounting of the assets or particularly liabilities. There are often disclosure requirements for potential liabilities and assets that are not actually recognised as an asset or liability.\n\nIf an item in the profit and loss account is never chargeable or allowable for tax or is chargeable or allowable for tax purposes but never appears in the profit and loss account then this is a permanent difference. A permanent difference does not give rise to deferred tax.\n\nIf items are chargeable or allowable for tax purposes but in different periods to when the income or expense is recognised then this gives rise to temporary differences. Temporary difference do give rise to potential deferred tax, but the rules on whether the deferred asset or liability is actually recognised can vary.\n\nTemporary differences are usually calculated on the differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability recognized in the statements of financial position and the amount attributed to that asset or liability for tax at the beginning and end of the year. The differences in the charges to the profit and loss account compared to the amounts taxable or allowable can also be calculated and should reconcile the change in position at the beginning and end of the year.\n\nThe basic principle of accounting for deferred tax under a temporary difference approach can be illustrated using a common example in which a company has fixed assets that qualify for tax depreciation.\n\nThe following example assumes that a company purchases an asset for $1,000 which is depreciated for accounting purposes on a straight-line basis of five years of $200/year. The company claims tax depreciation of 25% per year on a reducing balance basis. The applicable rate of corporate income tax is assumed to be 35%, and the net value is subtracted.\n\nAs the tax value, or tax base, is lower than the accounting value, or book value, in years 1 and 2, the company should recognize a deferred tax liability. This also reflects that the company has claimed tax depreciation in excess of the expense for accounting depreciation recorded in its accounts, whereas in the future the company should claim less tax depreciation in total than accounting depreciation in its accounts.\n\nIn years 3 and 4, the tax value exceeds the accounting value, therefore the company should recognise a deferred tax asset (subject to it having sufficient forecast profits so that it is able to use future tax deductions). This reflects that the company expects to be able to claim tax depreciation in excess of accounting depreciation.\n\nIn many cases the deferred tax outcome will be similar for a temporary difference or timing difference approach. However, differences can arise such as in relation to revaluation of fixed assets qualifying for tax depreciation, which gives rise to a deferred tax asset under a balance sheet approach, but in general should have no impact under a timing difference approach.\n\nDeferred tax is relevant to the matching principle.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities generally arise where tax relief is provided in advance of an accounting expense/unpaid liabilities, or income is accrued but not taxed until received\n\nDeferred tax assets generally arise where tax relief is provided after an expense is deducted for accounting purposes:\n\n\nAn asset on a company's balance sheet that may be used to reduce any subsequent period's income tax expense. Deferred tax assets can arise due to net loss carryover.\n\nModern accounting standards typically require that a company provides for deferred tax in accordance with either the temporary difference or timing difference approach. Where a deferred tax liability or asset is recognised, the liability or asset should reduce over time (subject to new differences arising) as the temporary or timing difference reverses.\n\nUnder International Financial Reporting Standards, deferred tax should be accounted for using the principles in IAS 12: Income Taxes, which is similar (but not identical) to SFAS 109 under US GAAP. Both these accounting standards require a temporary difference approach.\n\nOther accounting standards which deal with deferred tax include:\n\n\nManagement has an obligation to accurately report the true state of the company, and to make judgements and estimations where necessary. In the context of tax assets and liabilities, there must be a reasonable likelihood that the tax difference may be realised in future years.\n\nFor example, a tax asset may appear on the company's accounts due to losses in previous years (if carry-forward of tax losses is allowed). In this case a deferred tax asset should be recognised if and only if the management considered that there will be sufficient future taxable profit to use the tax loss. If it becomes clear that the company does not expect to make profits in future years, the value of the tax asset has been \"impaired\": in the estimation of management, the likelihood that this tax loss can be used in the future has significantly fallen.\n\nIn cases where the carrying value of tax assets or liabilities has changed, the company may need to do a write down, and in certain cases involving in particular a fundamental error, a restatement of its financial results from previous years. Such write-downs may involve either significant income or expenditure being recorded in the company's profit and loss for the financial year in which the write-down takes place.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19307978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19307978", "title": "Equal Justice for United States Military Personnel legislation", "text": "Equal Justice for United States Military Personnel legislation\n\nSince 2005, federal legislation has been introduced in the 109th Congress, 110th Congress, 111th Congress and the 112th Congress to amend Title 28 United States Code section 1259 to allow members of the United States Armed Forces to appeal court-martial convictions when the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces denies a petition for grant of review or extraordinary relief. In the 112th Congress the Equal Justice for Our Military Act of 2011, H.R. 3133 was introduced in the House of Representatives and the Equal Justice for Our Military Act of 2011, S. 1664 was introduced in the Senate. Both bills are currently pending.\n\nSince the establishment of the Supreme Court by the United States Constitution in 1789, Congress has not allowed service members direct appeal to the nation’s highest federal court should the service member be convicted by courts-martial. In 1950 Congress created the modern military justice system by enacting, in 1951, the Uniform Code of Military Justice. In 1984 Congress passed the Military Justice Act of 1983, that gave service members limited access to the Supreme Court. Under existing law, Title 28 United States Code section 1259, a service member may appeal to the Supreme Court in death penalty cases or if review is granted by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF) - which happens about twenty percent of the time. Also, the government can appeal any ruling in which the service member prevails by having the individual service judge advocate general certify an issue for appeal.\n\nCAAF, as initially established in 1951 (known then as \"Court of Military Appeals\") was the final authority on cases arising under the military justice system, except for a limited number of cases considered by the Supreme Court under collateral proceedings, such as through writs of habeas corpus.\n\nIn March 2004, Norbert Basil MacLean III, a former United States Navy cryptologist, began to petition Congress to permit all court-martialed service members access to the Supreme Court. Under MacLean's proposal, which Rep Davis (D-Calif.) and Senator Feinstein (D-Calif.) adapted as introduced bills in the House of Representatives and Senate, service members would be able to access the nation's highest court if CAAF denied a grant of review or relief in extraordinary writ and writ-appeal cases.\n\nAn August 2006 report issued by the American Bar Association (ABA) showed that ninety percent of all court-martialed service members whose cases were eligible for review by the court could not have Supreme Court review because the court had either denied a grant of a petition for review or denied extraordinary relief. The ABA called on Congress in 2006 to change the law and permit all court-martialed service members the right of review in the high court.\n\n\nOn April 23, 2004, the House Armed Services Committee sent a bipartisan letter, written by Reps. Davis (D-Calif.) and John Michael McHugh (R-NY), to The Pentagon asking for feedback on MacLean's proposal. Then-Principal Deputy General Counsel Daniel J. Dell'Orto wrote to lawmakers opposing MacLean's proposal of Supreme Court access for service members. According to the \"Los Angeles Daily Journal\", Dell'Orto stated that changing the law and giving service members greater Supreme Court access would only serve to burden the nation's highest court. Rep. Davis first introduced the \"Equal Justice for Our Military Act\" on March 17, 2005, in the 109th Congress. After its introduction the bill was opposed by the Bush administration through then-Department of Defense General Counsel William J. Haynes, II. Haynes wrote to Congress in opposition stating \"there is no apparent justification to modify the current review process, thereby increasing the burden upon the Supreme Court and counsel to address the myriad of matters that would be encountered with expanded certiorari jurisdiction.\" The bill failed in the 109th Congress.\n\nAt the behest of MacLean, Legislative Research Inc. (\"LRI\"), based in California, developed two decades of military justice statistics to present to Congress. LRI completed its study in March 2006. In August 2006, the American Bar Association (\"ABA\") issued a report and unanimously passed a resolution urging Congress to correct the law and permit U.S. armed forces members equal access to the Supreme Court. The ABA report references military justice statistics compiled as a direct result of MacLean's work on this issue noting that: \"CAAF denies petitions for grant of review and petitions for relief far more often than it grants them. While there is significant variation from year to year, in 2004-05, petitions for review were denied in 78.3 percent (581) of the cases and granted in 19.54 percent (145) of the cases. Petitions for grants of extraordinary relief were denied in 70.45 percent (31) of the cases and granted in 4.55 percent (2) of the cases. Equally sobering, the statistical compilation reveals that during the same time-period, there were 7,564 court-martial convictions and only 799 petitions for grant of review granted by CAAF.\"\n\nReps. Susan A. Davis, (D-Calif.) and Ike Skelton (D-Mo.) of the House Armed Services Committee reintroduced the bill that had previously failed in the last Congress entitled the \"Equal Justice for Our Military Act of 2007\", H.R. 3174. The reintroduced bill was in broader form and included not only denials for extraordinary writs but also petitions for direct review. It would amend 28 U.S.C. sections 1259(3) and (4) so that if the Court of Appeals denied review or relief to a service member an appeal could be taken to the Supreme Court. Six days after H.R. 3174's introduction, it received bipartisan support by Rep. Rodney Alexander (R-La.), a U.S. Air Force Reserve veteran, who signed on as cosponsor.\n\nOn September 17, 2007, a companion bill, identical to the House bill, was introduced in the Senate by Senators Feinstein (D-Calif.), then-Republican Arlen Specter, and Russ Feingold (D-Wis.), entitled \"Equal Justice for United States Military Personnel Act of 2007\". When the Senate returned from its 2008 summer recess, Senator Hillary Clinton (D-NY), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, signed on as cosponsor to the bill. On September 11, 2008 the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously voted to approve S. 2052. The next day S. 2052 was placed on the Legislative Calendar of the Senate.\n\nOn September 27, 2008, the House of Representatives debated and passed, by two-thirds voice vote, the \"Equal Justice for Our Military Act of 2007\", H.R. 3174. Rep. Lamar S. Smith (R-Tx.), the Ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee opposed the bill during floor debate arguing, among other things, that there were no hearings in the House Judiciary Committee. It was expected that the U.S. Senate would take up the House passed H.R. 3174 during the week of December 8, 2008. However, several print media and blogs had reported opposition by at least one Republican Senator who blocked a Senate floor vote on the bill.\n\nEarly in the 111th Congress two identical bills were introduced in both the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate to give servicemembers the same right to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court as civilian citizens. On January 15, 2009, Rep. Davis (D-Calif.) Chairwoman of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Military Personnel|Subcommittee on Military Personnel of the House Armed Services Committee reintroduced the bill in the 111th Congress as the \"Equal Justice for Our Military Act of 2009\", H.R. 569. H.R. 569 was referred to the House Judiciary Committee. Identical legislation was also introduced on January 30, 2009, when Senators Feinstein (D-Calif.), then-Republican Arlen Specter and Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) reintroduced the Senate bill in the 111th Congress as the \"Equal Justice for United States Military Personnel Act of 2009\", S. 357. The language of the reintroduced bills were the same as the previous bills in 110th Congress. Both the House and Senate bills were also the same language as MacLean first proposed to Congress in 2004.\n\nIn March 2009 before a joint session of the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committees, Ira Novoselsky, the national commander of the Jewish War Veterans of the United States of America announced that JWV was making the House bill and the issue of Supreme Court access for service members a legislative priority. Novoselsky asked the Veteran's Committee to weigh in on the important issue and stated that \"JWV supports legislation that will restore due process and equal treatment under the law for our service members and veterans\".\n\nOn June 11, 2009, the Subcommittee on Courts and Competition Policy of the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary held a hearing on H.R. 569. Witnesses who appeared before the subcommittee included retired Army Major General John D. Alternburg, Jr., Rep. Davis, and attorney Dwight H. Sullivan. Davis and Sullivan testified in support of the bill. Altenburg testified in opposition of the bill.\n\nOn July 30, 2009, the House Subcommittee on Courts and Competition Policy held a mark up on H.R. 569 and approved the bill for full House Judiciary Committee action.\n\nOn January 27, 2010, the full House Judiciary Committee, by voice vote, favorably reported H.R. 569 to the House of Representatives.\n\nOn July 14, 2010, a U.S. House of Representatives Report was filed which amended H.R. 569 and changed its name to the \"Equal Justice for Our Military Act of 2010\". H.R. 569 was placed on the Union Calendar of the U.S. House of Representatives. The House Report refers to MacLean in footnotes. One in particular states that \"during the full Committee mark-up of H.R. 569, Members of the Minority charged that the bill was introduced primarily for the benefit of a single individual, former Navy Officer Norbert Basil MacLean, III. In fact, a number of individuals and organizations have taken note of the inherent injustice of the current law. Additionally, it should be pointed out that H.R. 569 applies only to courts-martial that were initiated on or after the effective date of the Act, which thereby forecloses any personal benefit to Mr. MacLean, whose court-martial was concluded well before this legislation was introduced.\"\n\nThe Equal Justice for Our Military Act of 2011 has been introduced in the House of Representatives as H.R. 3133 and in the Senate as S. 1664. Currently, no action has been taken on either bill.\n\nOn October 6, 2008, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) issued a report entitled \"Supreme Court Appellate Jurisdiction Over Military Court Cases.\" The CRS report noted that under existing law the CAAF \"functions as a gatekeeper for military appellants' access to Supreme Court review.\" The report further noted that \"if the CAAF denies an appeal, the U.S. Supreme Court will typically lack the authority to review the decision. In contrast, criminal appellants in Article III courts have an automatic right of appeal to federal courts of appeals and then a right to petition the Supreme Court for review.\" On January 30, 2009, the CRS issued a second report also entitled \"Supreme Court Appellate Jurisdiction Over Military Court Case.\" This CRS report discusses HR 569 in the 111th Congress.\n\nThe United States Congressional Budget Office (CBO) issued a cost estimate on October 22, 2008, regarding the Equal Justice for United States Military Personnel Act of 2007, S.2052, 110th Congress. The CBO estimated costs to be approximately $1 million a year if S.2052 was enacted which would include the workload of Department of Defense attorneys and Supreme Court clerks. Further it estimates a possible additional $1 million to $2 million in appropriated funds for the Department of Defense to defend a case in the Supreme Court if a servicemember petitioned the high court for a writ of certiorari. However, the CBO determined that by enacting S.2052 there would be no direct spending and it would impose no costs on local, state or tribal governments.\n\nOn October 27, 2008, the \"Press-Enterprise\" noted in an article that the cost to the average family if S.2052 was enacted would be $0.16. On the topic of costs related to an increase in workload, the American Bar Association stated in a letter to House leaders that \"to those that argue that permitting equal access to the courts will create workload problems, we emphatically respond that nothing is more important than the provision of fundamental due process to our service members.\"\n\nOn June 11, 2009, Washington, DC attorney Dwight H. Sullivan testified before a House Judiciary subcommittee that the costs, should HR 569 (111th Congress) be passed, would be approximately $1,000 per case.\n\nOn February 2, 2010, the CBO issued a cost estimate on HR 569. The CBO's estimate indicates that \"Based on information provided by the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Supreme Court, CBO estimates that implementing the bill would increase the workload of DoD attorneys and Supreme Court clerks and would cost less than $1 million each year, assuming the availability of appropriated funds. We expect that the bill would make several hundred service members eligible to file petitions each year, but that only a small portion of those individuals would pursue review by the Supreme Court (based on the experience of individuals whose cases currently qualify for Supreme Court review). CBO cannot predict whether the Supreme Court would grant review of any particular petition. If the Supreme Court agreed to review any petitions, DoD would probably spend no more than $1 million in any year from appropriated funds to defend those cases. (Any such amounts would depend on the number and complexity of such cases.) Enacting H.R. 569 would not affect direct spending or revenues.\" The February 2010 estimate was considerably less in estimated costs compared to the previous CBO estimate in 2008.\n\nThe major opponents and proponents of the legislation are:\n\nThe following are opponents to the legislation and have either testified before Congress or sent letters in opposition which are part of the Congressional record:\n\nIn 2002 the \"Army Times\" editorial board was critical of the Department of Defense (DoD) trying to prevent servicemembers from accessing the federal courts regarding military personnel issues. William J. Haynes II had submitted various proposals to Congress, in the DoD 2002 budget proposal, to not allow service members access to the federal courts to challenge military personnel issues such as promotions, retention actions, separations, retirement, enlistments and re-enlistements.\n\nA front page article in the \"Los Angeles Daily Journal\" reported that Haynes opposed giving members of the U.S. Armed Forces access to the Supreme Court of the United States if they are court-martialed. In February 2006, he wrote letters to Congress opposing the \"Equal Justice for Our Military Act\", which was pending in the 109th Congress. Haynes opined that \"there is no apparent justification to modify the current review process, thereby increasing the burden upon the Supreme Court and counsel to address the myriad of matters that would be encountered with expanded certiorari jurisdiction.\" The next month, in March 2006, Navy veteran Norbert Basil MacLean III lobbied lawmakers with twenty-two years of military justice statistics showing that over 80 percent of all court-martialed service members are shut out of seeking U.S. Supreme Court review. In August 2006, the American Bar Association issued a report and passed a resolution urging Congress to give servicemembers Supreme Court access.\n\nIn July 2007 Representative Susan A. Davis (D-Calif.) reintroduced the \"Equal Justice for Our Military Act of 2007\", HR.3174. And in September 2007 Senators Dianne Feinstein and Arlen Specter introduced bipartisan identical legislation entitled the \"Equal Justice for United States Military Personnel Act of 2007\", S.2052 in the Senate. On September 27, 2008, during floor debate on HR 3174 in the U.S. House of Representatives Rep. Lamar S. Smith (R-Texas) cited a February 6, 2006, Haynes letter in support of his opposition to servicemembers having equal access to the U.S. Supreme Court. After debate the House passed HR 3174 by voice vote of a two-thirds majority.\n\nOn September 27, 2008, Representative Lamar S. Smith (R-Texas) in a House floor debate on the \"Equal Justice for Our Military Act of 2007\", HR 3174, opposed granting access to the Supreme Court of the United States to members of the U.S. Armed Forces. Smith had argued, among other things, that there had been no hearings in the House Judiciary Committee on the subject and for this and other reasons he opposed the legislation being considered on the House suspension calendar. In his floor debate, Smith cited a February 6, 2006, letter of former Department of Defense General Counsel William J. Haynes, II, who also opposed access of servicemembers to the Supreme Court. HR 3174 subsequently passed in the House by a two-thirds voice vote.\n\nThe following are proponents to the legislation and have either testified before Congress or sent letters in support which are part of the Congressional record:\n\nAfter MacLean was precluded from Supreme Court access by operation of 28 U.S.C. 1259(4), and learning that other service members were also, he began his advocacy to change the law. MacLean first started to petition Members of the 108th Congress in March 2004 to amend the law and permit service members access to the Supreme Court. MacLean's proposal, which was included in the HASC letter to the Defense Department, was simple: to permit a petition for writ of certiorari to be filed by any member of the U.S. Armed Forces who was denied review or relief by the CAAF. This concept would bring the Armed Forces court in line with other federal Courts of Appeal concerning Supreme Court review of federal criminal convictions. MacLean's proposal would afford service members full procedural due process protections in appellate review of courts-martial to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe \"Los Angeles Daily Journal\", the \"San Francisco Daily Journal\", the \"Los Angeles Times\" and the \"Legal Times\" published MacLean's commentary calling upon Congress to take action on pending bills allowing for service members to access the Supreme Court.\n\nU.S. Department of Defense officials in the George W. Bush administration were critical of MacLean's proposal to Congress. Department of Defense Principal Deputy General Counsel Daniel J. Dell'Orto indicated opposition to the issue of access to the Supreme Court for members of the U.S. Armed Forces. The House Armed Services Committee wrote a letter to the Defense Department attaching correspondence from MacLean on the inequity. Dell'Orto wrote back to the Armed Services committee criticizing MacLean's proposal for fear it would \"increase the burden upon the Supreme Court.\" In 2006 then-Department of Defense General Counsel William J. Haynes, II was critical of MacLean's proposal and indicated that the Bush administration opposes giving servicemembers equal access to the Supreme Court. In February 2006 Haynes opined to Congress that \"there is no apparent justification to modify the current review process, thereby increasing the burden upon the Supreme Court and counsel to address the myriad of matters that would be encountered with expanded certiorari jurisdiction.\"\n\nAfter the House of Representatives passed the \"Equal Justice for Our Military Act of 2007\", Robert E. Reed, an associate general counsel at the Department of Defense in the George W. Bush administration told \"The New York Times\" the legislation would increase the burdens on the Supreme Court and Defense Department lawyers, adding that supporters were not taking a “panoramic view.” “A lot of those supporters are only looking at this as a motherhood, apple pie sort of issue,” he said. “There’s a logic and a rationale to this. We’re not just trying to be mean and difficult for the defendants.” Reed's comment to \"The New York Times\" may have been in response to MacLean's 2007 comment to the \"San Diego Union Tribune\" when he (MacLean) said \"I think there is a high likelihood that this bill will pass because voting against it would be like voting against Mom and warm apple pie.” Finally, Reed told \"The New York Times\" “It’s the same old people with the same old arguments and the same propositions.”\n\nDespite critics in the George W. Bush administration, in 2005, the press secretary for Rep. Davis said in the \"Los Angeles Daily Journal\" that after considering MacLean's arguments, Davis believes both prosecution and defense should have equal opportunity to appeal to the Supreme Court. \"He brought up a very important issue of equality under the law,\" Aaron Hunter, press secretary said.\n\nThe American Bar Association mentioned MacLean in its resolution and report to Congress in 2006 which urged the law be changed to permit members of the U.S. Armed Forces to have equal access to the Supreme Court. The ABA report references MacLean's work on military justice statistics.\n\nDuring a 5 June 2009 House Judiciary subcommittee hearing on H.R. 569 (111th Congress), Rep. Davis made reference to MacLean in her testimony as \"a tireless champion for this issue and other military justice reform on behalf of the service members and veterans that fall under the jurisdiction of those [military courts of appeal].\"\n\nThe following organizations support service members' access to the Supreme Court:\n\nThree retired chief judges of the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces support the proposed legislation:\n"}

{"id": "1125811", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1125811", "title": "Fascist symbolism", "text": "Fascist symbolism\n\nAs there have been many different manifestations of fascism, especially during the interwar years, there were also many different symbols of fascist movements. Fascist symbolism typically involved nationalist imagery.\n\nOrganized fascist movements have militarist-appearing uniforms for their members; use national symbols, historical symbols of a nation as symbols of their movement; and use orchestrated rallies for propaganda purposes. Fascist movements are led by a \"Leader\" (i.e. \"Duce\", \"Führer\", \"Caudillo\" and so on) who is publicly idolized in propaganda as the nation's saviour. A number of fascist movements use a straight-armed salute.\n\nThe use of symbols, graphics, and other artifacts created by fascist, authoritarian and totalitarian governments has been noted as a key aspect of their propaganda. Most Fascist movements adopted symbols of Ancient Roman or Greek origin, for example the German use of Roman standards during rallies, the Italian adoption of the \"fasces\" symbol, the Spanish \"Falange\" from the Spanish word for \"Phalanx\".\n\nThe original symbol of fascism, in Italy under Benito Mussolini, was the fasces. This is an ancient Imperial Roman symbol of power carried by lictors in front of magistrates; a bundle of sticks featuring an axe, indicating the power over life and death. Before the Italian Fascists adopted the fasces, the symbol had been used by Italian political organizations of various political ideologies (ranging from socialist to nationalist), called Fascio (\"leagues\") as a symbol of strength through unity.\n\nItalian Fascism utilized the color black as a symbol of their movement, black being the color of the uniforms of their paramilitaries, known as Blackshirts. The blackshirt derived from Italy's daredevil elite shock troops known as the \"Arditi\", soldiers who were specifically trained for a life of violence and wore unique blackshirt uniforms. The colour black as used by the Arditi, symbolized death.\n\nFascist Italy was not officially racist, unlike its World War II Axis partner of Nazi Germany. But it equally gave importance to the purity of race, as Mussolini at multiple times expressed alarm towards a possible extinction of white people. Consolidation of gained territory in the northeast of Italy led to state-sanctioned persecution and ethnic cleansing of Slovenes, while closer ties with Hitler caused Mussolini to collaborate in sending Italian Jews to die in the Holocaust.\n\nIn a 1921 speech in Bologna (Italy), Mussolini stated, \"Fascism was born... out of a profound, perennial need of this our Aryan and Mediterranean race\". Mussolini was concerned with the low birth rates of the white race in contrast to the African and Asian races. In 1928, he noted the high birth-rate of blacks in the United States, and that they had surpassed the population of whites in certain areas, such as Harlem in New York City. He described their greater racial consciousness in comparison with American whites as contributing to their growing strength.\n\nOther symbols used by the Italian Fascists included the \"aquila\", the Capitoline Wolf, and the SPQR motto, each related to Italy's ancient Roman cultural history, which the Fascists attempted to resurrect.\n\nThe nature of German fascism, as encapsulated in Nazism was similar to Italian Fascism ideologically and borrowed symbolism from the Italian Fascists such as the use of mass rallies, the straight-armed Roman salute, and the use of pageantry. Nazism was different from Italian Fascism in that it was officially racist. Its symbol was the swastika, at the time a commonly seen symbol in the world that had experienced a revival in use in the western world in the early 20th century. German völkisch Nationalists claimed the swastika was a symbol of the Aryan race, who they claimed were the foundation of Germanic civilization and were superior to all other races.\n\nAs the Italian Fascists adapted elements of their ethnic heritage to fuel a sense of Nationalism by use of symbolism, so did Nazi Germany. Turn-of-the-century German-Austrian mystic and author Guido von List was a big influence on Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, who introduced various ancient Germanic symbols (filtered through von List's writings) most thoroughly into the SS, including the stylized double Sig Rune (von List's then-contemporary Armanen rune version of the ancient \"sowilo\" rune) for the organization itself.\n\nThe black-white-red tricolor of the German Empire was utilized as the color scheme of the Nazi flag. The color brown was the identifying color of Nazism (and fascism in general), due to it being the color of the SA paramilitaries (also known as Brownshirts).\n\nOther historical symbols that were already in use by the German Army to varying degrees prior to the Nazi Germany, such as the Wolfsangel and Totenkopf, were also used in a new, more industrialized manner on uniforms and insignia.\n\nAlthough the swastika was a popular symbol in art prior to the regimental use by Nazi Germany and has a long heritage in many other cultures throughout history - and although many of the symbols used by the Nazis were ancient or commonly used prior to the advent of Nazi Germany - because of association with Nazi use, the swastika is often considered synonymous with National Socialism and some of the other symbols still carry a negative post-World War II stigma in some Western countries, to the point where some of the symbols are banned from display altogether.\n\nThe fascist Falange in Spain utilized the yoke and arrows as their symbol. It historically served as the symbol of the shield of the monarchy of Ferdinand and Isabella and subsequent Catholic monarchs, representing a united Spain and the \"symbol of the heroic virtues of the race\". The original uniform of the \"Falangistas\" was the blue shirt – derived from the blue overalls of industrial workers – which was later combined with the red beret of the Carlists to represent their merger by Franco.\n\nOrganized fascist movements typically use military-like uniforms with the symbol of their movement on them.\n\nIn Italy, the Italian Fascist movement in 1919 wore black military-like uniforms, and were nicknamed Blackshirts. In power, uniforms during the Fascist era extended to both the party and the military which typically bore \"fasces\" or an eagle clutching a \"fasces\" on their caps or on the left arm section of the uniform.\n\nIn Germany, the fascist Nazi movement was similar to the Italian Fascists in that they initially used a specifically colored uniform for their movement, the tan-brown colored uniform of the SA paramilitary group earned the group and the Nazis themselves the nickname of the Brownshirts. The Nazis used the swastika for their uniforms and copied the Italian Fascists' uniforms, with an eagle clutching a wreathed swastika instead of a fasces, and a Nazi flag arm sash on the left arm section of the uniform for party members.\n\nOther fascist countries largely copied the symbolism of the Italian Fascists and German Nazis for their movements. Like them, their uniforms looked typically like military uniforms with Nationalist type insignia of the movement. The Spanish Falange adopted dark blue shirts for their party members, symbolizing Spanish workers, many of whom wore blue shirts. Berets were also used, representing their Carlist supporters. The Spanish Blue Division expeditionary volunteers sent to the Eastern Front of WW2 in (relatively indirect) support of the Germans likewise wore blue shirts, berets and their army trousers.\n\nMany other fascist movements did not win power or were relatively minor regimes in comparison and their symbolism is not well-remembered today in many parts of the world, although the BUF's Flash and Circle was later used by the non-fascist People's Action Party of Singapore.\n\n\nSome neo-Nazi organizations continue to use the swastika, but many have moved away from such inflammatory symbols of early fascism. Some neo-fascist groups use symbols that are reminiscent of the swastika or other cultural or ancestral symbols that may evoke nationalistic sentiment but do not carry the same racist connotations.\n\n\nOpponents of fascism have identified symbols seen in a pejorative manner such as the jackboot.\n\nSome of these symbols are also used by a variety of non-fascist movements and organizations. The swastika has been a notable symbol in Jainism, Buddhism, and Hinduism, as well as in modern pagan religions, such as in Germanic neopaganism. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) states:\nFasces are used in the national emblem of France, the coat of arms and wordmark of the Swedish Police and the Swedish Security Service, the coat of arms of the Swiss Canton of St. Gallen, and the coat of arms of the Spanish Civil Guard.\n\n\n"}

Framework decisions were similar to directives in that they required member states to achieve particular results without dictating the means of achieving that result. However unlike directives, framework decisions were not capable of direct effect, they were only subject to the optional jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and enforcement proceedings could not be taken by the European Commission for any failure to transpose a framework decision into domestic law.\n\nFramework decisions were created in the Amsterdam Treaty and replaced joint actions which were legal instruments available under the Maastricht Treaty. The Lisbon Treaty abolished framework decisions and the EU can now enact directives and regulations in the area of criminal justice by means of the ordinary legislative procedure.\n\nThe legal basis for framework decisions was Article 34 of the Treaty on European Union. As amended by the Treaty of Nice and before being repealed by the Lisbon Treaty this Article read:\n\nThe continued basis for framework decisions is set out in transitional provisions of the Lisbon Treaty. Article 9 of the Protocol on Transitional Provisions provides that:\n\nThe European Court of Justice only had jurisdiction to make preliminary rulings on the interpretation of framework decisions when a member state made a declaration under the (pre-Lisbon) Treaty on European Union indicating the circumstances in which the Court could exercise such a jurisdiction. All member states except Ireland and the United Kingdom made such a declaration.\n\nThe European Commission could not bring enforcement proceedings against member states for failing to implement a framework decision or for implementing it incorrectly. Although the Court did have jurisdiction to resolve disagreements between member states concerning the interpretation of framework decisions and to hear annulment proceedings regarding their validity.\n\nAs of the coming into force of the Lisbon Treaty the \"status quo ante\" regarding preliminary rulings and enforcement proceedings were preserved for a transitional period of five years although this transitional period ceases to apply to a framework decision which has been amended after the Lisbon's coming into force. After the transitional period has expired on 30 November 2014, preliminary rulings and enforcement proceedings have become possible.\n\nHowever the United Kingdom negotiated an opt-out from the continued legal force of framework decisions which it may put into effect no later that six months before the expiry of the transitional period by so notifying the Council of the European Union. In October 2012 the UK government announced that it intended to exercise this opt-out and then selectively opt back into certain measures. Unless this decision is reversed, all framework decisions which are not amended during the transitional period but which are still in force will cease to apply to the UK from 1 December 2014.\n\nThe following is an exhaustive list the 34 framework decision which were adopted between 1999 and 2009:\n\n\n"}

Berea College, 161 S.W. 204 (Ky. 1913), was a case heard before the Kentucky Court of Appeals wherein a restaurant owner sued a college when the college issued a new policy forbidding students from patronizing establishments not owned by the college.\n\nAround September 1, 1911, J.S. Gott—a businessman in Berea, Kentucky—purchased a restaurant located across a street from Berea College. A restaurant had been at that location for some years, and primarily subsisted on business from students from the college. Unbeknownst to Gott, during the 1911 summer vacation, the college authorities had revised the student code. Previously, the student code had forbidden students from entering \"any place of ill repute, liquor saloons, gambling houses\" or similar places. Beginning with the fall semester, which started September 11, 1911, the college promulgated the updated student code, which forbade students from entering \"eating houses and places of amusement in Berea[] not controlled by the college\". The punishment for any violation was immediate dismissal. Shortly after the new code was published, some students who continued to patronize Gott's restaurant were caught and expelled.\n\nOn September 20, Gott filed suit against the college, obtaining an injunction to enjoin enforcement of the rule, and initially seeking $500 in damages. He later requested an additional $1,500, claiming that the college had slandered him by telling the student body that Gott was a bootlegger. In the proceedings that followed, the injunction was dissolved, and the Gott's petition was ultimately dismissed. He appealed the dismissal.\n\nThe court acknowledged that Gott's business had been much reduced after the rule was effected but the question was whether the college's actions were unlawful. The court first determined that because Berea College was acting in loco parentis, the college did have the authority to issue the rule and that students at the college were obligated to conform their behavior to the rule since a \"...college or university may prescribe requirements for admission and rules for the conduct of its students, and one who enters as a student impliedly agrees to conform to such rules of government.\"\n\nThe court noted that a public institution, one supported \"from the public treasure\" had more exacting criteria to meet but since Berea College was a private institution, the above implied contract between student and college was sufficient.\n\nNext the court reviewed the relationship between Gott and Berea College to determine if there was a contractual relationship which the college had broken but found none. Finally, the court reviewed the question of unreasonable, malicious, or wrongful restraint of trade by the actions of the college but could find no evidence of such.\n\n\n"}

These mainly include tax exemptions and tax credits, and additional perks that range from access to bus lanes to waivers on fees (charging, parking, tolls, etc.). The amount of these incentives usually depend on battery size and the vehicle all-electric range, and some countries extend the benefits to fuel cell vehicles, and electric vehicle conversions of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. The IEA determined that, as of 2016, 0.2% of all passenger vehicles (approximately 2 million) currently on the road worldwide are electric.\n\nThe world's total final consumption of energy by sector represented 9,426 Million Tonnes of Oil Equivalent (Mtoe) in 2014, 28% of which is attributed to transport alone, accounting for an increase of 5% from 1971 statistics. Moreover, 23% of energy-related Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions worldwide are also attributable to transport. Thus, the electrification of the transport sector represents an area of opportunity for governments to cut their GHG emissions, which is why they are starting to champion policies that increase plug-in hybrid electric vehicles adoption rates. \n\nThe Chinese government adopted a plan in 2009 with the goal of turning the country into one of the leaders of all-electric and hybrid vehicles by 2012. The government's intention was to create a world-leading industry that would produce jobs and exports, and to reduce urban pollution and its oil dependence. However, a study found that even though local air pollution would be reduced by replacing a gasoline car with a similar-size electric car, it would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by only 19%, as China uses coal for 75% of its electricity production.\n\nThe Chinese government uses the term new energy vehicles (NEVs) to designate plug-in electric vehicles, and only pure electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles are subject to purchase incentives. On June 1, 2010, the Chinese government announced a trial program to provide incentives up to 60,000 yuan (~ in June 2011) for private purchase of new battery electric vehicles and 50,000 yuan (~ in June 2011) for plug-in hybrids in five cities. The cities participating in the pilot program are Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hangzhou, Hefei and Changchun. The subsidies are paid directly to automakers rather than consumers, but the government expects that vehicle prices will be reduced accordingly. The amount of the subsidy will be reduced once 50,000 units are sold. In addition to the subsidy, the Chinese government is planning to introduce, beginning on January 1, 2012, an exemption from annual taxes for pure electric, fuel-cell, and plug-in hybrid vehicles. Hybrid vehicles will be eligible for a 50% reduction only.\n\nIn 2011, only 8,159 electric cars were sold in China despite a 120,000 yuan subsidy.\nUnsubsidized lead-acid EVs are produced without government approval at a rate of more than 30,000 per year in Shandong and requires no driving license because the top speed is less than 50 km/h. They cost 31,600 yuan and have been the target of criticism from major car manufacturers.\n\nA mid-September joint announcement in 2013 by the National Development and Reform Commission and finance, science, and industry ministries confirmed that the central government will provide a maximum of toward the purchase of an all-electric passenger vehicle and up to for an electric bus. The subsidies are part of the government's efforts to address China's problematic air pollution.\n\nAs a result of the government support and new incentives issued in 2014, production of new energy vehicles between January and August reached 31,137 units, up 328% from the same period of 2013. Domestic production during the first eight months of 2014 includes 6,621 plug-in hybrid sedans and 16,276 all-electric cars.\n\nAdditionally, to further electric vehicle production, China passed measures to greatly increase the number of electric vehicles on the road. Original policy declared that companies with vehicles sales of over 30,000 vehicles must comply with new rules around NEVs. Each company was required to fulfill a number of NEV credits, as much as 8% by the year 2018. This target was later pushed to 2019, with a requirement of 12% by 2020. These credits are granted by the fuel efficiency and weight of the vehicles, so more fuel efficient vehicles count for more credits. Originally, these credits were granted according to the vehicles' range, however the final policy provided a more continuous way of determine credits. The breakdown of credits in the original proposal are given below:\n\nIn the final policy, credits were instead given by the formula: (0.012 × electric range + 0.8) × adjustment factor. These credits were capped at 6. Additionally, these credits can be bought and sold.\n\nIn February 2018, to further promote energy-efficient electric vehicles, China raised subsidies for electric vehicles meeting additional range requirements. Electric vehicle incentives for cars with at least 400 km of range increased from 44,000 yuan to 50,000 yuan, while vehicles with less than 150 km of range have been removed from the list of vehicles qualifying for an incentive. Changes were also made to the incentive structure for electric buses and trucks. Buses are now required to have a range of at least 150 km and have energy consumption of less than 0.7 Wh/km·kg.\n\nIn November 2010, the Government of India (GoI), through the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), announced a subsidy of million for electric vehicles. The subsidy provided benefits up to 20% on the ex-factory price, with a maximum benefit of on electric cars, on two-wheelers, on high speed two-wheelers, for electric minibuses, and for three-wheelers. To claim the subsidy, manufacturers needed to certify that 30% of the components were made in India. The scheme ended on 31 March 2012.\n\nIn April 2014, the Indian government announced a new plan to provide subsidies for hybrid and electric vehicles. The plan will have subsidies up to for cars and on two-wheelers. India aims to have seven million electric vehicles on the road by 2020.\n\nThere is no subsidy or incentive for hybrids and imported vehicles, which acts as a deterrent to new entrants. To meet the stated GoI objectives under the Paris Accord, the GoI has set deadline for 'Only Electric Vehicle (Manufacturing)' by 2030. Although highly ambitious as it may seem, there is growing recognition among policy makers to incentivise electric vehicle manufacturing under the 'Make In India ' policy, and a new framework policy for this was to be released by year end, 2017. Moreover, infrastructure for electric vehicle charging is also being considered; provided either through existing energy retailers like fuel pumps or by subsidising manufacturers' investments in the field.\n\nTesla Motors has been offered tax incentives and potential financial backing via Special Purpose Vehicles ('SPV's) to establish a domestic manufacturing unit in India. Although, there are local sourcing norms of 30%, electric vehicle entrants have been exempted. Yet much will depends on governments plan to subsidise the vehicle, due their high upfront cost, that will determine any potential shift in the market.\n\nAccording to an OECD report, India is regarded as a country providing the least subsidies, compared to other major markets, to renewable energy in electric vehicle and that may hamper the governments target of achieving the all electric target by 2030.\n\nVarious state governments and cities provide their own subsidies:\n\nThe Japanese government introduced the first electric vehicle incentive program in 1996, and it was integrated in 1998 with the Clean Energy Vehicles Introduction Project, which provided subsidies and tax discounts for the purchase of electric, natural gas, methanol and hybrid electric vehicles. The project provided a purchase subsidy of up to 50% the incremental costs of a clean energy vehicle as compared with the price of a conventional engine vehicle. This program was extended until 2003.\n\nIn May 2009 the National Diet passed the \"Green Vehicle Purchasing Promotion Measure\" that went into effect on June 19, 2009, but retroactive to April 10, 2009. The program established tax deductions and exemptions for environmentally friendly and fuel efficient vehicles, according to a set of stipulated environmental performance criteria, and the requirements are applied equally to both foreign and domestic produced vehicles. The program provides purchasing subsidies for two type of cases, consumers purchasing a new passenger car without trade-in (non-replacement program), and for those consumers buying a new car trading an used car registered 13 years ago or earlier (scrappage program).\n\nNew next generation vehicles, including electric and fuel cell vehicles, plug-in hybrids, hybrid electric vehicles, clean diesel and natural gas vehicles are exempted from both the acquisition tax and the tonnage tax. Acquisition taxes on used vehicles will be reduced by 1.6% to 2.7%, or between 150,000 yen (~US$1,600) and 300,000 yen (~US$3,200). Electric and fuel cell vehicles have a 2.7% reduction while plug-in hybrids have a 2.4% reduction.\n\nThese incentives are effected from April 1, 2009 until March 31, 2012 for the acquisition tax which is paid once at the time of purchase. The tonnage tax reductions are in effect from April 1, 2009 until April 30, 2012 and the incentive is applicable once, at the time of the first mandatory inspection, three years after the vehicle purchase. As an example, the amount exempted for the purchase of a new next generation vehicle is 81,000 yen (~US$975) corresponding to the acquisition tax, and 22,500 yen (~US$271) for the tonnage tax, for a total of 103,500 yen (~US$1,246).\n\nConsumers purchasing new next generation electric vehicles, including fuel cell vehicles, benefited from a 50% reduction of the annual automobile tax. These incentives were in effect from April 1, 2009 until March 31, 2010, applicable only once.\n\nSubsidies for purchases of new environmentally friendly vehicles without scrapping a used car are 100,000 yen (~US$1,100) for the purchase of a standard or small car, and 50,000 yen (~US$550) for the purchase of a mini or kei vehicle. Subsidies for purchasing trucks and buses meeting the stipulated fuel efficiency and emission criteria vary between 200,000 yen (~US$2,100) to 900,000 yen (~US$9,600).\n\nSubsidies for purchases of new environmentally friendly vehicles in the case of owners scrapping a 13-year or older vehicle are 250,000 yen (~US$2,700) for the purchase of a standard or small car, and 125,000 yen (~US$1,300) for the purchase of a mini or kei vehicle. Subsidies for purchasing trucks and buses meeting the stipulated fuel efficiency and emission criteria vary between 400,000 yen (~US$4,300) to 1,800,000 yen (~US$19,000).\n\nAll incentives for new purchases with or without trading were applicable in Japan's fiscal year 2009, from April 1, 2009 through March 31, 2010.\n\nUnder President Duterte's administration, the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion Act was signed into law, which has exemptions made for anyone buying an electric vehicle alongside hybrids.\n\nIn July 2016, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy announced a plan to make electric car batteries run longer, build a network of charging stations and make electric car purchases and ownership more affordable. The government expects that the current and future policy programs will help increase the electric car market share in South Korea to 0.5% in 2017, up from 0.2% in 2015, and to achieve 5.3% in 2020.\n\nThe government subsidy has in place a one-time purchase subsidy for electric cars. Effective July 8, 2016, the subsidy was increased to 14 million won () from 12 million won (). Also starting in 2016, the purchase tax surcharges of electric cars will be reduced, and all-electric car drivers will benefit from reductions in insurance premiums, expressway tolls and parking fees. The government plan calls for the deployment of fast charging stations in 2020 to be available at an average of one within a two-kilometer radius in the capital city of Seoul. In addition, 30,000 slow charging stations will be strategically located at about 4,000 apartment complexes nationwide by 2020.\n\nThe government's plan also includes the development of an electric car battery, beginning in 2016, with energy density high enough to more than double the travel distance on a charge to . The government expects to increase the global market share of South Korean electric cars to match that of South Korean gasoline and diesel cars, which reached 8.5% based on sales by South Korea's two main car exporters, Hyundai Motor Company and Kia Motors.\n\nElectrification of transport (electromobility) figures prominently in the Green Car Initiative (GCI), included in the European Economic Recovery Plan. DG TREN is supporting a large European \"electromobility\" project on EVs and related infrastructure with a total budget of around as part of the Green Car Initiative.\n\nThere are measures to promote efficient vehicles in the Directive 2009/33/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of clean and energy-efficient road transport vehicles and in the Directive 2006/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 on energy end-use efficiency and energy services.\n\nAs of April 2011, 15 of the 27 European Union member states provide tax incentives for electrically chargeable vehicles, which includes all Western European countries plus the Czech Republic and Romania. Also 17 countries levy carbon dioxide related taxes on passenger cars as a disincentive. The incentives consist of tax reductions and exemptions, as well as of bonus payments for buyers of PEVs, hybrid vehicles, and some alternative fuel vehicles.\n\nElectric vehicles are exempted from the fuel consumption tax, levied upon the first registration, and from the monthly vehicle tax. In addition to tax breaks, hybrid vehicles and other alternative fuel vehicles benefit from a fuel consumption tax that pays bonuses to passenger cars with low carbon dioxide output. Alternative fuel vehicles, including hybrids, qualify for as much as (around ) in annual bonuses. This bonus was valid from 1 July 2008 until 31 August 2012. Additionally, cars with no carbon emissions qualify for a deduction of the VAT (Value-Added Tax), as of January 2016.\n\nThe Belgian government established a personal income tax deduction of 30% of the purchase price including VAT of a new electric vehicle, up to €9,190. Plug-in hybrids are not eligible. This tax incentive ended on December 31, 2012. There is also available a tax deduction up to 40% for investments in external recharging stations publicly accessible, to a maximum of €250. The Wallonia regional government has an additional eco-bonus for cars registered before December 31, 2011.\n\nElectric vehicles, including cars, motorbikes and mopeds, are exempt from the annual circulation tax.\n\nVehicles with emissions less than 120 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer are exempt from paying registration taxes.\nElectric, hybrid and other alternative fuel vehicles used for business purposes are exempt from the road tax.\n\nIn 2016, battery electric vehicles lost access to their registration tax exemption. The registration tax will gradually be phased back in until 2020. there are only 7,000 electric cars in Denmark.\n\nNo grants towards the purchase of Plug-In or Electric vehicles as of 2016. Electric vehicles are exempt from the city public parking fees and can use bus lanes.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2014 Estonia has allocated a total of in grants towards the purchase of battery electric vehicles (ended 7 August 2014). From 2011 to 2014, KredEx has allocated grants totaling ; the average grant per car was . The grant has helped the purchase of over 650 electric cars in Estonia. At that time, a country-wide quick charging network (CHAdeMO 500V/120A and Type2 400V/32A) was established.\n\nThe Prime Minister of Finland (2003–2010) Mr. Matti Vanhanen has mentioned that he wants to see more electric cars on Finnish roads as soon as possible and with any cost to the governmental car related tax incomes. Charging at home from motor and cabin heating outlets (common in all Nordic countries) has been determined to be a possible load on the grid, although this load is expected to mainly take place at night when overall demand is lower. If all cars in Finland run totally on electricity, it will add 7-9 TWh annually to the load, which corresponds to 10% of Finland's annual consumption.\nOn-line route planners like http://www.uppladdning.nu/ list a daily growing number of free charging outlets set up by merchants and private individuals, making it possible to drive an EV for free from Helsinki through Sweden all the way to Copenhagen.\n\nFor the period of 2018-2021, €6,000,000 annually will be allocated towards the purchase of electric cars and conversion of petrol cars to E85 and gas. An individual registering a new electric car in the period 1.1.2018-30.11.2021 is eligible for a grant of €2,000, if the purchase price of the car is €50,000 or less.\n\nIn the end of 2017, there were 1,449 electric cars registered in Finland.\n\nSince 2008 France has a bonus-malus system offering a financial incentive, or bonus, for the purchase of cars with low carbon emissions, and a fee, or malus, for the purchase of high-emission vehicles. The bonus applies to private and company vehicles purchased on or after 5 December 2007 and are deduced from the purchase price of the vehicle. The malus penalty applies to all vehicles registered after 1 January 2008, and is added at the time of registration. Since 2009, every family with more than two children receives a deduction from the malus of 20 g of per km per child.\n\nUntil July 31, 2012, a premium up to , under the bonus-malus system, was granted for the purchase of new cars with emissions of 60 g/km or less which benefited all-electric cars and any plug-in hybrid with such low emissions. Vehicles emitting up to 125 g/km or less, such as conventional hybrids and natural gas vehicles, were granted up to . The incentive could not exceed 20% of the sales price including VAT, increased with the cost of the battery if it is rented.\n\nEffective on August 1, 2012, the government increased the bonus for electric cars up to but capped at 30% of the vehicle price including VAT. The price includes any battery leasing charges, and therefore, electric cars which need a battery leasing contract also are eligible for the bonus. For example, an electric car sold for including VAT was eligible for the maximum bonus of . The emission level for the maximum bonus was raised to 20 g/km or less. Cars with emission levels between 20 and 50 g/km were eligible to a bonus of up to , and between 50 and 60 g/km were eligible to a bonus of up to . After this limit, the bonus dropped to .\n\nThe fee schedule for the bonus-malus was modified in 2013. Effective November 1, 2013, the bonus was reduced from to for all-electrics and any other vehicle with emissions of less than 21 g/km. Vehicles emitting between 21 and 60 g/km, such as plug-in hybrids and conventional hybrids, were eligible to a bonus up to , and for emissions between 61 and 90 g/km up to , down from . Effective January 1, 2014, the fee schedule for the malus was increased to a maximum penalty of from for vehicles emitting over 200 g/km. Flex-fuel vehicles remained exempt from the malus fee. A neutral class applies to vehicles emitting between 91-130 g/km.\n\n\nFrom April 1, 2015, a super-bonus was introduced, increasing the financial incentive to a cumulative total of , consisting of the regular bonus of for purchasing a pure electric car, plus up to for customers scrapping a diesel-powered car in circulation before 1 January 2001. In the case of plug-in hybrids with emission levels between 21 and 60 g/km, the purchase bonus was plus the scrapping premium of . Also a specific grant was introduced for families which are below the income tax threshold who buy an ordinary new or second hand car below certain emission thresholds or a hybrid or electric car.\n\nEffective January 4, 2016, the bonus limited to 27% of the purchase price of vehicles emitting up to 20 g/km was kept. This bonus corresponds to pure electric vehicles and those equipped with a range extender. Vehicles emitting between 21 and 60 g/km are entitled to a bonus. This bonus corresponds to the majority of plug-in hybrids. Conventional hybrid passenger cars emitting between 61 and 110 g/km with sufficient level of hybridization, with an electric motor with an output power of not be less than 10 kW, are entitle to a bonus. Diesel-powered hybrids, such as the PSA Hybrid4, are no longer eligible for the bonus, even if the car emits less than 110 g/km of .\n\nThe combined super-bonus for the purchase or lease of a new all-electric car was maintained. To be eligible for the additional scrappage bonus, the old diesel-powered car have to be owned for at least a year and in circulation before 1 January 2006. The new vehicle must not be sold within 6 months of acquisition or have traveled less than .\n\nThe scrappage bonus for the purchase of an all-electric car was maintained at , while the bonus for plug-in hybrid car emitting between 21 and 60 g/km was set at . Only individuals or professionals are eligible for the scrappage bonus. Commercial vehicles are not eligible. Neither demonstration vehicles are eligible to the superbonus unless the vehicles are sold or leased within one year following the date of first registration. , the scrappage bonus of for trading in old diesel-powered cars has been granted to more than 10,000 purchase transactions.\n\n, the government proposal to be in force from 1 January 2017 provides that the super-bonus for scrapping a diesel vehicle over 10 years-old will be renewed. However, the bonus for the purchase of a pure electric car will drop to from in 2016, but to compensate, the additional scrappage bonus will be increased to from in 2016. Also, the government plans to introduce a purchase price cap to the vehicles eligible for the bonus, and to introduce a new bonus for two-wheeled motor vehicles. For the more polluting vehicles, the government intends to increase the maximum malus fee to from in 2016 for vehicles emitting more than 191 g/km, lowering the limit from 200 g/km in 2016.\n\nThe government intends to maintain the purchase bonus for plug-in hybrids with a emission level between 21 and 60 g/km. However, the proposal does not include anything about the conversion premium for scrapping a 10-year-old diesel car for the purchase of a plug-in hybrid. The purchase bonus for non-rechargeable hybrid vehicles will be eliminated.\n\n\"Nationale Plattform Elektromobilität\" (NPE) is a German government initiative to develop Germany into a leading market for electric mobility. In May 2010, under its National Program for Electric Mobility, Chancellor Angela Merkel set the goal to bring 1 million electric vehicles on German roads by 2020. However, the government also announced that it would not provide subsidies to the sales of plug-in electric cars but instead it will only fund research in the area of electric mobility. Electric vehicles and plug-ins are exempt from the annual circulation tax for a period of five years from the date of their first registration. In 2016, the annual circulation tax exemption was extended from five to ten years, backdated to 1 January 2016.\n\nThe private use of a company car is treated as taxable income in Germany and measured at a flat monthly rate of 1% of the vehicle's gross list price. So plug-in electric cars have been at a disadvantage since their price tag can be as much as double that of a car using a conventional internal combustion engine due to the high cost of the battery. In June 2013 German legislators approved a law that ends the tax disadvantage for corporate plug-in electric cars. The law, backdated to 1 January 2013, allows private users to offset the list price with per unit of battery size, expressed in kilowatt hours (kWh). The maximum offset was set at corresponding to a 20 kWh battery. The amount one can offset will sink annually by per kilowatt hour. The range criteria will rise to starting in 2018. As part of the package of financial incentives approved in 2016, private owners of plug-in electric vehicles that charge their cars in their employer premises are exempted from declaring this perk as a cash benefit in their income tax return. Employers who provide this perk are allowed to discount from their income tax a 25% of the lump sum value of the cash benefit. These two fiscal benefits apply only from 1 January 2017 until the end of 2020.\n\nIn August 2014, the federal government announced its plan to introduce non-monetary incentives through new legislation to be effective by 1 February 2015. The proposed user benefits include measures to privilege battery-powered cars, fuel cell vehicles and some plug-in hybrids, just like Norway does, by granting local governments the authority to allow these vehicles into bus lanes, and to offer free parking and reserved parking spaces in locations with charging points. Not all plug-in hybrids will qualify for the benefits, only those with emissions of no more than 50 g/km or an all-electric range of over are eligible.\n\nAccording to the fourth progress report of the German National Electric Mobility Platform, only about 24,000 plug-in electric cars are on German roads by the end of November 2014, well behind the target of 100,000 unit goal set for 2014. As a result, Chancellor Angela Merkel recognized in December 2014 that the government has to provide more incentives to meet the goal of having 1 million electric cars on the country's roads by 2020. Among others, and based on the recommendations of the report, the federal government is considering to offer a tax break for zero-emission company cars, more subsidies to expand charging infrastructure, particularly to deploy more public fast chargers, and more public funding for research and development of the next generation of rechargeable batteries.\n\n\nAt the beginning of 2016, German politicians from the three parties in Mrs. Merkel's ruling coalition and auto executives began talks to introduce a subsidy for green car buyers worth up to () to boost sales of electric and plug-in hybrid cars. , the German government proposal is for the auto industry to cover 40% of the cost of the purchase subsidy. Private buyers would get the full subsidy, while corporate buyers would receive for each electric car, and the program is expected to run until 2020, the deadline set to achieve the goal of 1 million electric cars on German roads. Incentives will fall by each year. In March 2016, Nissan Europe announced its support to the green car incentive and its commitment to double the government's E-premium incentive when buying a Nissan electric car, with a reduction of the purchase price of the same amount of the subsidy. Nissan Center Europe CEO said \"\"we remain convinced that the goal of one million electric cars by 2020 is still achievable\".\" According to Nissan if from now on electric car sales double every year until 2020, it is still possible to achieve the government goal.\n\nAn incentive scheme to promote plug-in electric vehicle adoption was approved in April 2016 with a budget of (). A total of () is reserved for the purchase subsidies, which are expected to run until all the money is disbursed, estimated to last until 2019 at the latest. Another () are budgeted to finance the deployment of charging stations in cities and on autobahn highway stops. And another () would go toward purchasing electric cars for federal government fleets. The program is aimed to promote the sale of 400,000 electric vehicles. The cost of the purchase incentive is shared equally between the government and automakers. Electric car buyers get a () discount while buyers of plug-in hybrid vehicles get a discount of (). Premium cars, such as the Tesla Model S and BMW i8, are not eligible to the incentive because there is a cap of () for the purchase price. Only electric vehicles purchased after 18 May 2016 are eligible for the bonus and the owner must keep the new electric car at least nine months. The same rule applies for leasing.\n\n, BMW, Citroën, Daimler, Ford, Hyundai, Kia, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Peugeot, Renault, Toyota, Volkswagen, and Volvo had signed up to participate in the scheme. In May 2016, Nissan announced the company decided to raise the bonus with an additional () to () for customers of its all-electric Leaf car and e-NV200 utility van. The online application system to claim the bonus went into effect on 2 July 2016. , a total of 26 plug-in electric cars and vans are eligible for the purchase bonus. According to the Federal Office of Economics and Export Control (BAFA), a total of 4,451 applications have been made for the government subsidy for the purchase of a plug-in electric model , consisting of 2,650 all-electrics and 1,801 plug-in hybrids. , the federal states with the most claims are Bayern (1,130), Baden-Württemberg (873), and Nordrhein-Westfalen (726).\n\n, the following 26 plug-in electric cars and vans are eligible for the purchase bonus: Audi A3 e-tron, BMW 225xe, BMW 330e, BMW i3, Citroën Berlingo Electric, Citroën C-Zero, Ford Focus Electric, Kia Soul EV, Mercedes-Benz B-Class Electric Drive (B 250e), Mercedes-Benz C350 e, Mitsubishi i-MiEV, Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEV, Nissan e-NV200 5- and 7-seater Combi, Nissan Leaf, Peugeot iOn, Peugeot Partner Electric, Renault Kangoo Z.E., Renault Zoe, Smart Fortwo electric drive, Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid, Volkswagen e-Golf, Volkswagen e-Up!, Volkswagen Golf GTE, Volkswagen Passat GTE, and Volvo V60 Plug-in Hybrid.\n\nFrom 2011 to June 2016, all electric vehicles were exempt from the registration tax. From 1 July 2016 onwards the registration tax for hybrid vehicles was reduced to 50%.\n\nAll hybrid and electric vehicles are exempt from registration tax. The Government announced that from October 27, 2016, electric vehicles would be eligible for a 21% rebate of the gross purchase price, capped at a ( at the December 2016 exchange rate). Furthermore, to promote electric cars, the Government has added some other regulatory incentives, such as green license plates, and simplified tax and regulations on electric charge points. By 2020, the Government expects that there will be 30,000 environmentally friendly cars on Hungarian roads.\n\nAll electric vehicles are exempt from VAT up to , and the tax is applied at the normal rate for the remainder of the price. Electric vehicles also get free parking in the city center for up to 90 minutes, which also applies to cars with emissions of less than 120 g/km and weigh less than 1,200 kg, which excludes several electric cars such as the Tesla Model S.\n\nSeries production EVs were exempted from VRT until December 2012. The VRT exemption was replaced by a €5000 credit against the tax. Annual motor tax for EVs is €120. The Government has set a target of 10% for all vehicles on Irish roads to be electric by 2020.\n\nThe ESB eCar electric vehicle charging network serves as the main charging network for the island of Ireland and has rapidly expanded in recent years. Currently the network is free to use with an RFID card provided by ESB to EV owners who wish to use the network. The network aims to provide rapid charging every 30 km on major routes and as of 2015 has almost 2000 standard charging points (all provide connection via IEC 62196 Type 2 Mennekes, around half are 22 kW with the remainder a mix of 3.6 kW and 7.4 kW). There are around 100 CHAdeMO rapid chargers with over 70 located outside the Dublin Metro area. All rapid chargers installed since mid-2014 have been triple standard CHAdeMO/Combined Charging System/AC 43 kW. Four rapid chargers in Dublin and two rapid chargers in Belfast were co-funded by the EU as part of the UK/Ireland RCN program. The UK charging network operated by Ecotricity has a single CHAdeMO only rapid charger at IKEA Belfast. This is the sole rapid charger on the island that is not part of the ESB eCars network.\n\nSustainable Energy Authority of Ireland offers a government grant of up to €5,000 for the purchase of a new electric car. Electric and hybrid vehicles had a reduction of up to off the registration tax between July 2008 and December 2010. However this grant is only available on vehicles on an approved list of models which must be sold by a dealer registered for the scheme. No grant applies where a vehicle is imported privately. The grant is reduced to €3,800 for business purchasers or those who require finance to purchase the vehicle, however some importers will report financed private sales as cash sales to acquire the full grant.\n\n, plug-in electric car purchasers are eligible for a government credit worth up to (about ). Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT), up to is also waived for electric cars. Also, all-electric car owners pay the lowest rate of annual road tax, which is based on emissions. In addition, the first 2,000 electric cars registered in Ireland are eligible for installation of a free home-charging points worth about (about ).\n\nElectric vehicles are exempt from the annual circulation tax or ownership tax for five years from the date of their first registration. Thereafter, EVs benefit from a 75% reduction of the tax rate applied to equivalent gasoline-powered vehicles. In the region of Lombardy, electric vehicles are exempt from the annual ownership tax.\n\nElectric vehicles, including cars, goods vehicles, buses, and motorcycles, are exempt from payment of the Vehicle Operation Tax. \n\nBuyers of electric vehicles and other vehicles emitting 60 g/km or less of carbon dioxide are eligible to receive a premium of (around ), this premium ended 31 December 2011. In order to qualify for the rebate, the owner must have concluded an agreement to buy electricity from renewable energy.\n\nBuyers of electric vehicles and plug in hybrids are eligible to receive (around ) from the Monegasque Government. In addition vehicles owners are allowed to park free at any public parking facility.\n\nConsidering the potential of plug-in electric vehicles in the country due to its relative small size and geography, the Dutch government set a target of 15,000 to 20,000 electric vehicles with three or more wheels on the roads in 2015; 200,000 vehicles in 2020; and 1 million vehicles in 2025. The first government target was achieved in 2013, two years earlier, thanks to the sales peak that occurred at the end of 2013. According to official figures, 30,086 plug-in electric vehicles with three or more wheels have been registered in the country through 31 December 2013.\n\nInitially, the Dutch government set incentives such as the total exemption of the registration fee and road taxes, which resulted in savings of approximately for private car owners over four years, and for corporate owners over five years. Other vehicles including hybrid electric vehicles were also exempt from these taxes if they emit less than 95 g/km for diesel-powered vehicles, or less than 110 g/km for gasoline-powered vehicles. The exemption from the registration tax ended on January 1, 2014, and thereafter, all-electric vehicles pay a 4% registration fee and plug-in hybrids a 7% fee.\n\nIn addition, the national government offers through the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment a subsidy on the purchase of all-electric taxis or delivery vans. This subsidy increases to per vehicle in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht, and Arnhem-Nijmegen metropolitan area. An additional subsidy is offered by several local government for the purchase of full electric taxis and vans, in Amsterdam and in Limburg and Tilburg.\n\nIn Amsterdam EV owners also have access to parking spaces reserved for battery electric vehicles, so they avoid the current wait for a parking place in Amsterdam, which can reach up to 10 years in some parts of the city. Free charging is also offered in public parking spaces. EV owners in the city of Rotterdam are entitled to one year of free parking in downtown and enjoy subsidies of up to if they install a home charger using green electricity. The city also introduced in 2014 a scrappage program to remove old polluting vehicles to improve air quality in the city. Rotterdam offers a incentive for business buyers to replace the old vehicles with all-electric vehicles. The subsidy is only available to the first 5,000 applicants that buy an eligible vehicle before the end of December 2013.\nOther factors contributing to the rapid adoption of plug-in electric vehicles are the relative small size of the country, which reduces range anxiety (the Netherlands stretches about east to west); a long tradition of environmental activism; high gasoline prices ( per gallon as of January 2013), which make the cost of running a car on electricity five times cheaper; and also some EV leasing programs provide free or discounted gasoline-powered vehicles for those who want to take a vacation driving long distances. With all of these incentives and tax breaks, plug-in electric cars have similar driving costs to conventional cars.\n\nInitially, sales of plug-in electric car were lower than expected, and during 2012 the segment captured a market share of less than 1% of new car sales in the country. As a result of the end of the total exemption of the registration fee, the segment sales peaked at the end of 2013, and plug-in electric car sales reached a market share of 5.34% of new car sales in 2013. The total cost of the tax exemptions for the Dutch treasury of the more than 22,000 plug-in electric vehicles sold in 2013 was estimated at ().\n\nThe Parliament of Norway set the goal to reach 50,000 zero emission vehicles by 2018. Among the existing incentives, all-electric cars are exempt in Norway from all non-recurring vehicle fees, including purchase taxes, which are extremely high for ordinary cars, and 25% VAT on purchase, together making electric car purchase price competitive with conventional cars. As an example, by early 2013 the price of the top selling Nissan Leaf is 240,690 kroner (around ) while the purchase price of the 1.3-lt Volkswagen Golf is 238,000 Krone (about ). Electric vehicles are also exempt from the annual road tax, all public parking fees, and toll payments, as well as being able to use bus lanes.\n\nGovernment officials reserved in 1999 the \"EL\" prefix for exclusive use of all-electric vehicles in order to be able to enforce on the road the benefits available to EVs. As the \"EL\" series is set to end at \"EL 99999\" (most vehicles in the country have five-digit registration numbers between 10000 and 99999), the Norwegian Public Roads agency opted for the prefix \"EK\" in the second series of plates, to signify \"elektrisk kjøretøy\", Norwegian for electric vehicle. And because the sale of electric vehicles is expected to continue at a rapid pace, meaning that the second phase of license plates is likely to run out as well, the \"EV\" prefix has been set aside for future electric cars. In July 2016, as the stock of \"EL\" prefix plates was almost depleted, the first electric vehicles registered with the new \"EK\" series were on the road.\n\nUntil June 2013, plug-in hybrids have not been eligible for these benefits. Because the Norwegian tax system levies higher taxes to heavier vehicles, plug-in hybrids are more expensive than similar conventional cars due to the extra weight of the battery pack and its additional electric components. Beginning on 1 July 2013, the existing weight allowance for conventional hybrids and plug-in hybrids of 10% will be increased to 15% for PHEVs.\n\nIn September 2013 the Norwegian Parliament approved, as part of the revised 2014 budget, an exemption from the 25% VAT for leasing electric vehicles effective on 1 January 2014. However, , the exemption has not gone into effect because the Minister of Finance decided to defer the measure, pending a formal consultation with the EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA) to ensure that the VAT exemption for leasing was not in violation of the European Economic Area Agreement. The government's loss of revenue due to the still not implemented leasing exemption is estimated at about 47 million krone (around ) per year. One Member of Parliament has criticized the government for the delay. He had argued that the initial VAT exemption for all electric vehicles was never approved in ESA. In addition, an ESA spokesman confirmed that the Government has not sent any request , nor has ESA received any complaints about Norway's original EV tax exemption. The MP said he will demand that the decision be implemented when Parliament meets in October 2014.\n\nThe target of 50,000 electric cars on Norwegian roads was reached on 20 April 2015, more than two years earlier than expected. In early March 2015 negotiations began among parties represented in the Parliament to define the future of all motor vehicles and fuel taxes. The Liberal Party wanted all the benefits to continue beyond the established quota. The Ministry of Finance also made a comprehensive review of all motor vehicle taxes. The two purchase tax exemptions cost the government about 3 billion krone (around ) in lost revenue just in 2014, and up to 4 billion krone (around ) if all the other benefits are accounted for. Despite passing the established cap of 50,000 electric cars, the tax benefits were expected to continue at least until the end of 2016.\n\nIn May 2015 the Government decided to keep the existing incentives through 2017, and the political parties in Parliament agreed to reduced and phase out some of the incentives. Beginning in January 2018, electric car owners will be required to pay half of the yearly road license fee and the full rate as of 2020. The value-added tax (VAT) exemption for electric cars will end in 2018, but replaced by a new scheme, which may be subjected to a ceiling that could be reduced as technology develops. The agreement also gave local authorities the right to decide whether electric cars can park for free and use public transport lanes.\n\nIn March 2016, the Ministry of Transport issued new regulations for parking in locations with access to the general public. The new parking regulations, that go into effect on January 1, 2017, terminated the free parking for zero-emission vehicles, but established that Municipalities can introduce payment exemption for electric and hydrogen powered motor vehicles on municipal parking locations. , the city councils of Trondheim and Tønsberg decided to introduce full payment for EVs from 2017; the cities of Bodø and Tromsø will introduce payment for parking in downton but exempted parking outside the city's center; and the cities of Oslo, Mandal and Drammen decided to keep free parking for zero-emission vehicles.\n\nThe Portuguese Government launched in early 2008 a national Programme for Electric Mobility called Mobi.E.\n\nMobi.E is deploying a national electric mobility system. The system was designed to be scalable and used in multiple geographies, overcoming the current situation of lack of communication among the different electric mobility experiences that are being deployed in Europe. By the first semester of 2011, a wide public network of 1 300 normal and 50 fast charging points will be fully implemented in the main 25 cities of the country.\n\nEVs are fully exempt from both the Vehicle Tax due upon purchase (Imposto Sobre Veículos) and the annual Circulation Tax (Imposto Único de Circulação). Personal income tax provides an allowance of EUR 803 upon the purchase of EVs. EVs are exempt from the 5%-10% company car tax rates which are part of the Corporation Income Tax. The Budget Law provides for an increase of the depreciation costs related to the purchase of EVs for the purpose of Corporation Income Tax.\n\nPortugal established a government subsidy of €5,000 for the first 5,000 new electric cars sold in the country. In addition, there is in place a €1,500 incentive if the consumer turns in a used car as part of the down payment for the new electric car. Electric cars are also exempt from the registration tax.\n\n, Romania offers a government grant of up to 25% of the price (up to a maximum of ) for the purchase of a new electric car. Furthermore, through the cash-for-clunkers program (scrappage program), those who wish to purchase an electric car will receive vouchers of over €5,000 total in return for their used car. For hybrid vehicles, with or without plug-in capabilities, a €550 grant is offered, plus an additional €160 grant for hybrid vehicles emitting under 100g/km of . Combined with the cash-for-clunkers program, the total grant is up to €2200.\nElectric and hybrid vehicles are exempt from the environmental tax, which also acts as a registration tax.\nFrom March 2015, electric vehicles are also exempt from the annual tax, while hybrid vehicles have a 95% reduction.\n\nIn 2016, the \"Rabla Plus\" program offered a government grant of for the purchase of a new electric car. In 2017, the \"Rabla Plus\" grant program increased to EUR 10,000 for the purchase of a pure electric vehicle (BEV). Furthermore, car owners will receive an additional if they end their registration of a car older than eight years.\n\nSpain's government aimed to have 1 million electric cars on the roads by 2014 as part of a plan to cut energy consumption and dependence on expensive imports, Industry Minister Miguel Sebastián said.\n\nIn May 2011 the Spanish government approved a () fund for year 2011 to promote electric vehicles. The incentives include direct subsidies for the acquisition of new electric cars for up to 25% of the purchase price, before tax, to a maximum of €6,000 per vehicle (US$8,600), and 25% of the gross purchase price of other electric vehicles such as buses and vans, with a maximum of €15,000 or €30,000, depending on the range and type of vehicle. Several regional government grant incentives for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles including electric and hybrid vehicles. In Aragón, Asturias, Baleares, Madrid, Navarra, Valencia, Castilla-La Mancha, Murcia, Castilla y León electric vehicles are eligible to a €6,000 tax incentive and hybrids to €2,000.\n\nIn September 2011 the Swedish government approved a program, effective starting in January 2012, to provide a subsidy of per car for the purchase of electric cars and other \"super green cars\" with ultra-low carbon emissions (below 50 grams of carbon dioxide per km). There is also an exemption from the annual circulation tax for the first five years from the date of their first registration that benefits owners of electric vehicles with an energy consumption of 37 kWh per 100 km or less, and hybrid vehicles with emissions of 120 g/km or less. In addition, for both electric and hybrid vehicles, the taxable value of the car for the purposes of calculating the benefit in kind of a company car under personal income tax is reduced by 40% compared with the corresponding or comparable gasoline- or diesel-powered car. The reduction of the taxable value has a cap of per year.\n\n, a total of 5,028 new \"super clean cars\" had been registered in the country since January 2012, and because the government allocated funds for a total of 5,000 super clean cars between 2012 and 2014, the fund has been exhausted. BIL Sweden, the national association for the automobile industry, requested the government an additional to cover the subsidy for another 2,500 registrations of new super clean cars between August and December 2014. In December 2014 the Riksdagen, the Swedish parliament, approved an appropriation of to finance the super clean car subsidies in 2015. The appropriation for 2015, according to the parliamentary decision and subsequent government decision, was to also be used for the retroactive payment of the super green cars registered in 2014 that did not receive the subsidy.\n\nThe Government raised the appropriation for the super green car rebate by for 2015 and by for 2016. Beginning in 2016, only zero emissions cars are entitled to receive the full premium, while other super green cars, plug-in hybrids, receive half premium. The exemption for the first five years of ownership from the annual circulation tax is still in place. In 2016, in order to promote the introduction of electricity-powered buses in the market, the Government planned to allocate for 2016 and per year between 2017 and 2019 to introduce an electric bus premium.\n\nTwo alternative proposals are being considered by the Swedish government regarding the introduction of a bonus-malus system. Both proposals entail changes to vehicle and car benefit taxation and the premium system for purchases of new cars. An official inquiry report was due by 29 April 2016. The goal is for the system to enter into force on 1 January 2017.\nThe new bonus-malus system, starting 1 july 2018, will offer electric car buyers a bonus of 60 000 SEK.\n\nSwitzerland has a car import tax which is 4% of the purchase price (before adding the VAT) which is waived for electric cars. Since Switzerland consists of 26 cantons which have their own legislature, additional incentives for plug-in electric vehicles differ between the respective regions. The current list can be downloaded from the website of the Swiss Department of Energy.\n\nThere are no additional incentives on the actual purchase price, but some cantons offer road tax cuts. The Swiss road tax is a yearly recurring fixed amount calculated based on the specifications of the tax payers car. Currently, only the cantons Glarus (GL), Solothurn (SO), Ticino (TI) and Zurich (ZH) are completely waiving the tax for plug-in electric vehicles.\n\n\nBased on a usual car with the following specification:\n\nThe resulting tax to be paid per year will be . Hence when calculating with a life expectancy of 10 years, the car owner in this example might save around when buying a plug-in electric car.\n\nHowever, since the tax on fossil fuels are relatively high in all European countries, including Switzerland, there is still an indirect, but quite strong incentive for car buyers to decide for energy efficient vehicles.\n\nBased on the following examples:\n\nThe resulting taxes on the burned fuels will be around per year, which results in over the car's 10-year lifetime.\n\nThe Plug-in Car Grant started on 1 January 2011 and is available across the UK. The program reduces the up-front cost of eligible cars by providing a 25% grant towards the cost of new plug-in cars capped at (). From 1 April 2015, the purchase price cap was raised to cover up to 35% discount of the vehicle's recommended retail price, up to the already existing limit. This change means electric cars priced under will be able to take advantage of most or all of the £5,000 discount. Both private and business fleet buyers are eligible for this grant, which is received at the point of purchase and the subsidy is claimed back by the manufacturer afterwards. The subsidy programme is managed in a similar way to the grant made as part of the 2009 Car Scrappage Scheme, allowing consumers to buy an eligible car discounted at the point of purchase with the subsidy claimed back by the manufacturer afterwards.\n\nThe government announced in April 2014 that funding for the full grant of up to will remain in place until either 50,000 grants have been issued or 2017, whichever is first. As forecasts estimated that the scheme will reach its 50,000 limit around November 2015, the government announced in August 2015 that the Plug-in Car Grant will continue until at least February 2016 for all plug-in cars with emissions of 75 g/km of under. The Government also announced that a minimum of () has been made available to continue the Plug-in Car Grant.\n\nVehicles eligible for the subsidy must meet the following criteria:\n\nIn February 2015 the government announced that to take account of rapidly developing technology, and the growing range of ULEVs on the British market, the criteria for the plug-in car grant was updated and from April 2015, eligible ultra-low emission vehicles (ULEVs) must meet criteria in one of the following categories depending on emission levels and zero-emission-capable mileage, with a technology neutral approach, which means that hydrogen fuel cell cars are also eligible for the grant:\n\nIn December 2015, the Department for Transport (DfT) announced that Plug-in car grant was extended until March 2018 to encourage more than 100,000 UK motorists to buy cleaner vehicles. A total funding of (~) is available for the extension. To reflect the changes in the British market, the criteria for the Plug-in Car Grant was updated and the maximum grant drops from (~) to (~). For the extension, the amount of the grant is linked in directly with the Office for Low Emission Vehicles three vehicle categories issued in April 2015. The eligible ultra-low emission vehicles (ULEVs) must meet criteria in one of three categories depending on emission levels ( emissions bands between 50 and 75g/km) and zero-emission-capable mileage (minimum of ), with a technology neutral approach, which means that hydrogen fuel cell cars are eligible for the grant. The updated scheme went into force on 1 March 2016.\n\nA price cap is in place, with all Category 1 plug-in vehicles eligible for the full grant no matter what their purchase price, while Category 2 and 3 models with a list price of more than (~) are eligible for the grant. Vehicles with a zero-emission range of at least (category 1), including hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, get a full (~), but plug-in hybrids (categories 2 and 3) costing under (~) receive (~). Under the extended scheme, some plug-in hybrid sports car are no longer be eligible for the grant, such as the BMW i8 because of its (~) purchase price tag. The grant scheme will come under review when a cumulative total of 40,000 Category 1 claims, and 45,000 Category 2 and 3 combined sales have been made. Both these totals will include cars sold before March 2016.\n\n, the following 31 cars available in the British market are eligible for the grant according to their category:\n\nBMW i3, BYD e6, Citroen C-Zero, Ford Focus Electric, Hyundai Ioniq Electric, Kia Soul EV, Mahindra e2o, Mercedes-Benz B-Class Electric Drive, Nissan e-NV200 5- and 7-seater Combi, Nissan Leaf, Peugeot iOn, Renault Fluence Z.E., Renault Zoe, Smart Fortwo electric drive, Tesla Model S, Toyota Mirai, Volkswagen e-Golf, and Volkswagen e-Up!.\n\nAudi A3 e-tron (MY 2016 only), BMW 225xe, BMW 330e, Kia Optima PHEV, Mercedes-Benz C350 e, Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEV (except GX3h 4Work), Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid, Vauxhall Ampera, Volkswagen Golf GTE, Volkswagen Passat GTE, Volvo V60 Plug-in Hybrid (D5 and D6 Twin Engine), and Volvo XC90 T8 Twin Engine Momentum.\n\nCategory 2 or 3 vehicles with a recommended retail price over £60,000 aren't eligible for a grant. This includes: BMW i8 (category 2), Mercedes-Benz S500 Plug-in Hybrid (category 3), and Porsche Panamera S E-Hybrid (category 3).\n\nThe Tesla Roadster was not included in the government's list of eligible vehicles for the plug-in electric car grant. Tesla Motors stated that the company applied for the scheme, but did not complete its application.\n\nIn addition to the extension of the Plug-in Grant, the government also announced it will continue the \"Electric Vehicle Homecharge Scheme.\" Starting in March 2016 owners of ultra-low emission vehicles who install a dedicated charge point at their home, covering roughly half the average cost, will get (~) towards the cost of installing the charging point, rather than the previous (~) maximum.\n\nThe Plug-In Car Grant began in February 2012. Van buyers can receive 20% - up to - off the cost of a plug-in van. To be eligible for the scheme, vans have to meet performance criteria to ensure safety, range, and ultra-low tailpipe emissions. Consumers, both business and private will receive the discount at the point of purchase. The Plug-In Van Grant scheme was extended in October 2016 to make electric trucks above 3.5 tonnes eligible for grants of up to , when businesses switch their large trucks to an electric vehicle. The government also announced their commitment for an additional to the scheme so that all vans and trucks meeting the eligibility requirements can benefit from the grant scheme. The extension of the Plug-In Van grant means that N2 vans (3.5 – 12 tonnes gross weight) and N3 vans (over 12 tonnes gross weight) are now eligible.\nThe eligibility criteria for vans with a gross weight of 3.5 tonnes or less (N1 van) are:\n\nor extra evidence of battery performance to show reasonable performance after 3 years of use\n\n, the number of claims made through the Plug-in Van Grant scheme totaled 2,938 units since the launch of the programme in 2012, up from 1,906 made by the end of December 2015. the following nine vans are eligible for the grant: BD Otomotive eTraffic, BD Otomotiv eDucato, Citroën Berlingo, Mercedes-Benz Vito E-Cell, Mitsubishi Outlander GX3h 4Work, Nissan e-NV200, Peugeot ePartner, Renault Kangoo Z.E., and Smith Electric Edison.\n\nThe number of eligible registered plug-in electric vehicles passed the 25,000 unit milestone in January 2015. , the number of eligible registered plug-in electric cars that have benefited with the subsidy totaled 94,541 units since the launch of the programme in 2011. , the number of claims made through the Plug-in Van Grant scheme totaled 2,938 units since the launch of the programme in 2012. About 90,000 plug-in electric vehicles have been registered in the UK up until December 2016, including over 85,000 plug-in hybrids and all-electric cars, and about 4,000 plug-in commercial vans. Not all vehicles were eligible for the grant schemes.\n\nOn 19 November 2009, Andrew Adonis, the Secretary of State for Transport, announced a scheme called \"Plugged-in-Places\", making available £30 million to be shared between three and six cities to investigate further the viability of providing power supply for electric vehicles, and encouraging local government and business to participate and bid for funds.\n\nThe UK government is supporting the \"Plugged-In Places\" program to install vehicle recharging points across the UK. The scheme offers match-funding to consortia of businesses and public sector partners to support the installation of EV recharging infrastructure in lead places across the UK. There are eight Plugged-In Places:East of England; Greater Manchester; London; Midlands; Milton Keynes; North East;\n\nAll-electric vehicles (BEVs) and eligible plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) qualify for a 100% discount from the London congestion charge. A plug-in electric drive vehicle qualifies if the vehicle is registered with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and has a fuel type of 'electric', or alternatively, if the vehicle is a 'plug-in hybrid' and is on the Government's list of PHEVs eligible for the OLEV grant. , approved PHEVs include all extended-range cars such as the BMW i3 with range extender and Vauxhall Ampera, and plug-in hybrids that emit 75g/km or less of and that meet the Euro 5 standard for air quality, such as the Audi A3 Sportback e-tron, BMW i8, Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEV, and Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid.\n\nThe original Greener Vehicle Discount was substituted by the Ultra Low Emission Discount (ULED) scheme that went into effect on 1 July 2013. The ULED introduced more stringent emission standards that limited the free access to the congestion charge zone to any car or van that emits 75g/km or less of CO and meets the Euro 5 emission standards for air quality. there are no internal combustion-only vehicles that meet this criteria. The measure is designed to limit the growing number of diesel vehicles on London's roads. Mayor Boris Johnson approved the new scheme in April 2013, after taking into account a number of comments received during the 12-week public consultation that took place. About 20,000 owners of vehicles registered for the Greener Vehicle Discount by June 2013 were granted a three-year sunset period (until 24 June 2016) before they have to pay the full congestion charge.\n\nThe Ontario Ministry of Transportation (MTO) established the Electric Vehicle Incentive Program (EVIP) – later renamed the Electric and Hydrogen Vehicle Incentive Program (EHVIP) in 2010. To qualify, Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) had to be purchased or leased from a seller in Ontario and owned or leased for at least 12 months. Leased vehicles with 12 month terms received 33% of the incentive, 24-month lease terms received 66%, and lease terms 36 months or longer received the full incentive. Vehicles were required to be on a government-developed list of approved vehicles to qualify, and vehicles with a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of or greater were not eligible for the incentive. Electric vehicles with a battery size of 5 -16 kWh were eligible for incentives from to . Vehicles with a battery size exceeding 16 kWh qualified for to . Vehicles with five or more seats were eligible for an additional . Demonstration vehicles under a specified mileage and used exclusively for test drives at dealerships or leasing companies were also eligible. Applications for incentives were required to be submitted within 3 months of the vehicle's provincial registration. Prior to the cancellation of the program, the Government of Ontario included rebates of up to for electric and hybrid vehicles. The EHVIP was financed by proceeds from Ontario's participation with Quebec and California in the Western Climate Initiative (WCI) cap-and-trade program. \n\nThe program (and the companion incentive program to encourage private businesses to install charging stations) was cancelled on July 11, 2018 after the government of Premier Doug Ford began the withdrawal of Ontario from the WCI. Rebates will still be issued for vehicles if either of the following conditions are met: the vehicle was delivered to the consumer, registered, and plated on or before July 11; or the vehicle is currently in the inventory of a dealership or was ordered from the manufacturer on or before July 11, provided that the vehicle is delivered to the consumer, registered, and plated by September 10.\n\nElectric vehicles in Ontario are eligible for special license plates, officially called Green Vehicle License Plates, from the Ministry of Transportation. In addition to a green colour scheme distinct from the province's typical blue and white license plates, these green plates permit BEV and PHEV owners to travel in the province's high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) and travel at no cost in the high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes, regardless of the number of passengers in the vehicle.\n\nQuebec began offering rebates of up to (~ ) beginning on January 1, 2012, for the purchase of new plug-in electric vehicles equipped with a minimum of 4 kWh battery, and new hybrid electric vehicles were eligible for a rebate. All-electric vehicles with high-capacity battery packs were eligible for the full rebate, and lower incentives were set for low-range electric cars and plug-in hybrids. Quebec's government earmarked (~ ) for the program, and the maximum rebate amount was set to be slowly reduced every year until a maximum of in 2015, but the rebates would continue until the fund runs out. There was also a ceiling for the maximum number of eligible vehicles: 10,000 for all-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids, and 5,000 for conventional hybrids.\n\nIn November 2013, the provincial government announced its decision to earmark in 2014 an additional (~ ) to fund a three-year extension to the electric-vehicle rebate program. The maximum rebate was kept at , but a graded scale was introduced in order to spread the incentive over 10,000 or more vehicles. Quebec's government also set the goal to deploy 12,500 more electric vehicles in the province by 2017, consisting of 10,200 consumer cars, 325 taxis, and 2,000 government-fleet vehicles. Also, incentives were issued for \"greening\" 525 taxis, aimed to introduce 325 plug-in vehicles (275 plug-in hybrids and 50 all-electrics) and 200 conventional hybrids. The purchase incentives start at for battery-electric taxis, for plug-in hybrids, and for conventional hybrids, with the rebate declining over time. The province planned to also subsidize 125 Level 2 stations for the taxi industry, paying 75% of the cost up to , and pay for the majority of costs to fund 10 Level 3 chargers for taxis.\n\nAlso in 2013, the provincial government announced it support to deploy 5,000 new charging stations. A total of 500 stations were to be located around various cities and along the province's so-called Electric Circuit route, another 1,000 near government buildings, and 3,500 at various workplaces for employee use. Businesses are eligible for a 75% rebate on installation costs up to for Level 1 or Level 2 charging stations. In addition, a 50% rebate will continue to be offered to individuals for installation of home charging stations, with a maximum of . Also the government announced an initiative for the gradual electrification of the provincial government's own vehicle fleet. The goal is to replace vehicles of the provincial government's 34 ministers (cabinet-level officials) with plug-in hybrid or pure electric vehicles by March 2017. The government expects to bring 2,000 plug-in vehicles into the provincial fleet over the same time.\n\nIn October 2016, the National Assembly of Quebec passed a new zero emission vehicle legislation that obliges any carmaker who sells in the Canadian province more than 4,500 new vehicles per year over a three-year average, to offer their customers a minimum number of plug-in hybrid and all-electric models. Under the new law, 3.5% of the total number of autos sold by carmakers in Quebec have to be zero emissions vehicles (ZEV) starting in 2018, rising to 15.5% in 2020. A tradable credit system was created for those carmakers not fulfilling their quotas to avoid financial penalties. The quotas will be determined by Quebec's Ministry of Sustainable Development. Quebec became the first Canadian province to pass such legislation, joining ten U.S. states, including California, that have similar ZEV laws. Quebec aims to have 100,000 zero emission vehicles on the road by 2020. Initially, the provincial government set the goal in 2011 to have 300,000 plug-in vehicles on the roads by 2020.\n\nAs of April 1, 2015, British Columbia's Clean Energy Vehicle (CEV) Program, funded by the Government of British Columbia and administered by the New Car Dealers of British Columbia industry group, was renewed with funding for approximately 1250 to 1500 vehicles. This program will expire on March 31, 2020 or when the in new funding is depleted. The current levels of incentives are: for an EV (min.15 kWh capacity), for a plug-in hybrid or an extended range vehicle with a smaller battery capacity (min. 4 kWh capacity) and up to for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, these amounts may be reduced annually. All vehicles must be new and purchased in BC, each claim is processed by the dealer at the Point of Sale and deducted from the vehicle price. The previous program that provided funding to cover part of the cost of installing home EV charging equipment has been discontinued. There is also a separate provincially funded \"SCRAP-IT\" program with incentives for scrapping model year 2000 or earlier, conventional gas powered vehicles. Basic incentives range from bus passes to coop car-share membership credits, or in cash. However, there is also the option of applying for a rebate cheque (plus off the Point of Sale purchase price) when buying a new or used EV (min.15 kWh capacity). The \"SCRAP-IT\" rebate program currently brings the combined provincial incentives available to buyers of a qualifying new EV in BC to .\n\nThe Government of British Columbia had announced the \"LiveSmart BC\" program, which started offering rebates of up to per eligible clean energy vehicle commencing on December 1, 2011. The incentives were available until March 31, 2013 or until available funding were depleted, whichever came first. Available funds were enough to provide incentives for approximately 1,370 vehicles. Battery electric vehicles, fuel cell vehicles and plug-in hybrids with battery capacity of 15.0 kWh and above are eligible for a incentive. Also effective December 1, 2011, rebates of up to per qualifying electric vehicle charging equipment were available to B.C. residents who had purchased a clean energy vehicle. As of February 14, 2014, the Point of Sale Incentive Program and Residential Electric Charging Station Program had depleted their budgets and were no longer accepting applications for rebates prior to the Point of Sale incentive program being re-funded in April 2015.\n\nSince 2016, PHEV and BEV owners can apply for a special decal which permits access to high-occupancy vehicle lanes regardless of the number of passengers in the vehicle.\n\nMexico has set a minimum goal of clean energies as part of the electric power generation mix in for the next years (25% in 2018, 30% in 2021 and 35% in 2024) as a strategy to reach Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emission cuts. Energy efficiency is also regarded as one of the greater cost-benefit potential alternatives to achieve GHG reduction. Moreover, the transport sector in Mexico represents 44.7% of the total final consumption of energy, almost 17% more than the world average (28%). Thus, replacing low fuel efficient transport with alternative fuels is regarded as a considerable contribution to reduce 50% of its GHG emissions by the year 2050, as established by the General Law on Climate Change commitments. Therefore, incentives for PHEVs have been created both at regional and federal levels to decrease cost of ownership for the end-consumers.\n\nMinimum fuel efficiency by vehicle class\nIn Mexico, there are several existing incentives regarding Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV) at a federal level. Fiscal incentives for end-consumers include higher daily lease tax deductions per car ($285 versus $200 MXN), higher tax deduction caps per car ($250,000 versus $175,000 MXN), and fiscal credits for up to 30% of investments for charging stations located in public places. Furthermore, PHEVs are exempt of the tax on new vehicles (paid by the manufacturer, assembler or dealer).\n\nAlso, the electrical power service contract for residential charging stations can be independent of household consumption under a commercial rate, which can save up to 40% on electricity compared to consolidating billing in the same meter.\n\nIn Mexico City, Mexico State and Jalisco, PHEVs are exempt from vehicular emission verification. They can instead obtain an exempt hologram which unbounds them from the restrictions imposed by the vehicular emission verification programs, which limits car usage. PHEVs are also exempt of the annual ownership vehicle tax in Baja California, Durango, Mexico City, Mexico State, Nayarit, Tlaxcala and Queretaro. In Mexico City, they also have right to a 50% discount on other contributions (permits, concessions, registry, etc.), and models from 2002 to 2017 pay only an endorsement right for vehicle control services. Finally, in Mexico City, PHEVs also have preferential parking in private and public parking lots.\n\nAs of January 2017, in Mexico there were 700 public access charging stations for PHEVs that are privately owned. The Ministry of Energy and the state owned electric power utility, Comision Federal de Electricidad, will destine $25 million MXN to install 100 more charging stations through 2017-2018 in the metropolitan areas of Guadalajara, Monterrey and Mexico City. As of now, users of the existing network can charge their PHEVs for free, as the cost of electricity is absorbed by the owners of the establishments where the charging stations are located.\n\nIn his 2011 State of the Union address, President Barack Obama set the goal for the U.S. to become the first country to have one million electric vehicles on the road by 2015. For this purpose, his administration pledged billion in federal grants to support the development of next-generation electric vehicles and batteries. The funds were allocated as follows: $1.5 billion in grants to U.S. based manufacturers to produce highly efficient batteries and their components; up to $500 million in grants to U.S. based manufacturers to produce other components needed for electric vehicles, such as electric motors and other components; and up to $400 million to demonstrate and evaluate plug-in hybrids and other electric infrastructure concepts—like truck stop charging station, electric rail, and training for technicians to build and repair electric vehicles (greencollar jobs).\n\nConsidering that actual plug-in car sales were lower than initially expected, as of early 2013, several industry observers have concluded that Obama's one million goal was unattainable. As of December 2016, approximately 542,000 EVs have been sold to date in the U.S. According to a July 2012 study by Pike Research, cumulative sales will reach the one million goal set by the Obama Administration only in 2018, while other analysts agree that the goal could be achieved in 2018. With only about 400,000 plug-in electric cars sold in the United States by the end of December 2015, Secretary of Energy, Ernest Moniz, said in January 2016 that the one million goal may not be reached until 2020. According to the Secretary purchases have fallen well below President Barack Obama's goal due to low gasoline prices, which had a negative impact on sales. Also improvements in battery technology are required as lowering battery costs is \"absolutely critical\" to boost electric vehicle sales. U.S. cumulative plug-in sales since 2008 achieved the 500,000 unit milestone in August 2016.\n\nIn March 2018, a group of America's largest electric utilities sided with U.S. automakers and asked Congress to preserve the tax credit in order to support the continued growth of sales of electric vehicles. Currently, there are hundreds of thousands of electric vehicles on the road. However, the auto industry is approaching a point at which the tax incentives will begin to expire. According to \"Daily Energy Insider\", \"The utilities' efforts occur at a time when growth in electric sales is sluggish and electric companies see a possible opportunity to apply the latest battery technology to help serve their customers.\"\n\nThe Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 granted tax credits for new qualified plug-in electric drive motor vehicles. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) also authorized federal tax credits for converted plug-ins, though the credit is lower than for new PEVs. American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 (ACES) also has extensive provisions for electric cars. The bill calls for all electric utilities to, \"develop a plan to support the use of plug-in electric drive vehicles, including heavy-duty hybrid electric vehicles\". The bill also provides for \"smart grid integration,\" allowing for more efficient, effective delivery of electricity to accommodate the additional demands of plug-in electric vehicles. Finally, the bill allows for the Department of Energy to fund projects that support the development of PEVs and smart grid technology and infrastructure.\n\nAs defined by the 2009 ACES Act, a PEV is a vehicle which draws propulsion energy from a traction battery with at least 4 kwh of capacity and uses an offboard source of energy to recharge such battery. The tax credit for new plug-in electric vehicles is worth $2,500 plus $417 for each kilowatt-hour of battery capacity over 4 kwh, and the portion of the credit determined by battery capacity cannot exceed $5,000. Therefore, the maximum amount of the credit allowed for a new PEV is $7,500. Both the Nissan Leaf electric vehicle and the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid, launched in December 2010, are eligible for the maximum $7,500 tax credit. The Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid, released in January 2012, is eligible for a $2,500 tax credit due to its smaller battery capacity of 5.2 kWh. All Tesla cars and Chevrolet Bolts are eligible for the 7,500 tax credit.\n\nAs granted by the 2009 ACES Act, electric vehicles produced after 2010 are eligible for an IRS tax credit from $2,500 to $7,500. There are some limitations and rules however that go along with the applied tax credit from electric vehicles. When an electric vehicle is leased, the tax credit is held by the manufacturer offering the lease, not by the lessee. Other restrictions that affect PEV tax credit include limitation of credit for electric vehicles used in reselling purposes, terms requiring the vehicle to remain in the United States, and production by qualified sellers.\n\n\nThese granted tax credits on PEV vehicles will phase out once 200,000 plug-in vehicles are sold in the U.S. During this phase out period after 200,000 plug-in car sales, qualified producers will experience a drop in a tax credit of $7,500 to $3,750 for the next 6 months followed by a drop to $1,875 for another 6 months until the credit is ran out completely.\n\nThe qualified plug-in electric vehicle credit phases out for a PEV manufacturer over the one-year period beginning with the second calendar quarter after the calendar quarter in which at least 200,000 qualifying vehicles from that manufacturer have been sold for use in the U.S. Cumulative sales started counting sales after December 31, 2009. After reaching the cap, qualifying PEVs for one quarter still earn the full credit, the second quarter after that quarter PEVS are eligible for 50% of the credit for six months, then 25% of the credit for another six months and finally the credit is phased out.\n\nIn July 2018, Tesla Inc. was the first plug-in manufacturer to pass 200,000 sales and the full tax credit will be available until the end 2018, with the phase out beginning in January 2019. , General Motors combined sales of plug-in electric vehicles in the U.S. totaled 196,986 units and are expected to pass 200,000 early in 2019. Thereafter, the applicable tax credit reduces gradually until it is completely phase out beginning on January 1, 2020.\n\nA 2013 study published in the journal \"Energy Policy\" determined that current federal subsidies are \"not aligned with the goal of decreased gasoline consumption in a consistent and efficient manner.\" In particular, hybrid-vehicle credit is given according to battery capacity rather than on the vehicle's all-electric range. Across the battery-capacity and charging-infrastructure scenarios examined, the lowest-cost solution is for more drivers to switch to traditional hybrid electrics or low-capacity plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). Installing charging infrastructure would provide lower gasoline savings per dollar spent than paying for increased PHEV battery capacity.\n\nA 2016 study conducted by researchers from the University of California, Davis found that the federal tax credit was the reason behind more than 30% of the plug-in electric sales. The impact of the federal tax incentive is higher among owners of the Nissan Leaf, with up to 49% of sales attributable to the federal incentive. The study, based on a stated preference survey of more than 2,882 plug-in vehicle owners in 11 states, also found that the federal tax credit shifts buyers from internal combustion engine vehicles to plug-in vehicles and advances the purchase timing of new vehicles by a year or more.\n\nThe 2009 ARRA provided a tax credit for plug-in electric drive conversion kits. The credit is equal to 10% of the cost of converting a vehicle to a qualified plug-in electric vehicle and in service after February 17, 2009. The maximum amount of the credit is $4,000. The credit does not apply to conversions made after December 31, 2011.\n\nThrough 2010, there was a federal tax credit equal to 50% of the cost to buy and install a home-based charging station with a maximum credit of for each station. Businesses qualified for tax credits up to $50,000 for larger installations. These credits expired on December 31, 2010, but were extended through 2013 with a reduced tax credit equal to 30% with a maximum credit of up to for each station for individuals and up to for commercial buyers.\n\nTwo separate initiatives were pursued in 2011 to transform the tax credit into an instant cash rebate; these did not pass. The objective of both initiatives was to make new qualifying plug-in electric cars more accessible to buyers by making the incentive more effective. The rebate would have been available at the point of sale allowing consumers to avoid a wait of up to a year to apply the tax credit against income tax returns. The first initiative was from Senator Debbie Stabenow who reintroduced the \"Charging America Forward Act.\" This bill was introduced in August 2010 but was not voted by the full Senate. The bill would have turned the tax credit into a rebate worth up to for plug-in electric vehicles and also would have provided businesses with a tax credit for purchasing medium or heavy duty plug-in hybrid trucks. The other initiative was from the Obama Administration and was submitted in the FY2012 Budget as a provision to transform the existing credit into a rebate that would have been claimable by dealers and passed along to the consumers, this was not included in the Budget.\n\nAnother change plug-in tax credit was proposed by Senator Carl Levin and Representative Sander Levin who proposed to raise the existing cap on the number of plug-in vehicles eligible for the tax credit. The proposal would have raised that limit from the existing 200,000 PEVs per manufacturer to 500,000 units, this was not passed.\n\nIn March 2014 the Obama Administration included a provision in the FY2015 Budget to increase the maximum tax credit for plug-in electric vehicles and other advanced vehicles to . However, the new maximum tax credit would not apply to luxury vehicles with a sales price of over , which would be capped at . The proposal sought to remove the 200,000 vehicle cap per manufacturer after which the credit phases out over a year. Instead, the incentives would begin to phase out—falling to 75% of the current credit—starting in 2019 for all manufacturers, and would be completely phased out by 2022; this did not get included in the Budget.\n\nIn November 2017, House Republicans proposed scrapping the $7,500 tax credit as part of a sweeping tax overhaul, but the final bill passed left the credit intact.\n\nThe Clean Vehicle Rebate Project (CVRP), initially funded with a total of million by the California Environmental Protection Agency's Air Resources Board (ARB), was established in order to promote the production and use of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs), including plug-in electric and fuel cell vehicles. The program was created from Assembly Bill 118 that was signed by Governor Schwarzenegger in October 2007. The funding is provided on a first-come, first-served basis, and the project is expected to go through 2015.\nEligible vehicles include only new ARB-certified or approved zero-emission or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. A list of eligible vehicles can be found on the California Center for Sustainable Energy web site. Among the eligible vehicles are neighborhood electric vehicles, battery electric, plug-in hybrid electric, and fuel cell vehicles including cars, trucks, medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicles, and zero-emission motorcycles. Vehicles must be purchased or leased on or after March 15, 2010. Rebates of up to $5,000 per light-duty vehicle are available for individuals and business owners who purchase or lease new eligible vehicles. Certain zero-emission commercial vehicles are also eligible for rebates up to $20,000.\n\nAs of early September 2012, private individuals accounted for 88% of rebate funds reimbursed. As of early March 2013, CARB has issued about 18,000 rebates totaling million. However, CARB notices that approximately 2,300 Chevrolet Volts were sold in California before the Volt became eligible for the rebate in February 2012. As a result of the rebate and other existing incentives, such as allowing solo drivers in HOV lanes, California is the leading PEV market in the United States with about 40% of all new plug-in electric vehicles sold nationwide during 2011 and 2012, while the state represents about 10% of all new car sales in the country.\n\n, a total of 52,264 clean vehicle rebates have been issued by the CVRP, for a total of disbursed, with only remaining for fiscal year 2013-2014. , the CVRP was facing an estimated funding shortfall for the 2013-14 fiscal year, and uncertainty about additional funding for the 2014-15 fiscal year. CARB staff presented a proposal to the board to overcome the funding shortage and also to facilitate the rebates to benefit buyers in disadvantaged communities who live in areas with bad air quality or who can't afford high-end electric cars.\n\nA bill signed into law in September 2014, mandated the CARB to draft a financial plan to meet California's goal of putting one million vehicles on the road while making sure that disadvantaged communities can participate. CARB had to change the Clean Vehicle Rebate program to provide an extra credit for low-income drivers who wish to purchase or lease an electric car. CARB also provides assistance to carsharing programs in low-income neighborhoods and install charging stations in apartment buildings in those communities. Under bill SB 1275, low-income residents who agree to scrap older, polluting cars will also get a clean vehicle rebate on top of existing payments for junking smog-producing vehicles.\n\nAnother bill signed into law in September 2014, AB 1721, grants clean air vehicles free or reduced rates in high-occupancy toll lanes (HOT) lanes. AB 2565 facilitates access to charging stations by requiring commercial and residential property owners to approve installation if the charging station meets requirements and complies with the owner's process for approving a modification to the property.\n\n, California added income-based caps to its rebate system. Buyers with incomes less than 300% of the Federal poverty level will get up to for a plug-in hybrid, for an all-electric car, and for a hydrogen fuel-cell car and the rebate scales down until Californian buyers with incomes over are no longer are eligible for incentives on hybrids or electric cars, however can get . As of March 2016, the Center for Sustainable Energy has issued more than $291 million in the CVRP for over 137,200 vehicles since 2010.\n\nThe income-base caps went into effect on 1 November 2016. Residents will not be eligible for rebates if their gross annual income exceeds for single tax filers, for head of household filers and for joint filers. These limits do not apply to the purchase of fuel cell electric vehicles, which represent less than 1% of rebate applications.\n\nThe standard tax credits (on eligible cars) are $1,500 for plug-in hybrids, $2,500 for all-electrics, and $5,000 for fuel cell cars.\n\nIn California a vehicle that meets specified emissions standards may be issued Clean Air Vehicle (CAV) decals that allow the vehicle to be operated by a single occupant in California's high-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV), or carpool or diamond lanes. All-electric vehicles are classified as Federal Inherently Low Emission Vehicles (ILEVs), and as zero emissions vehicles are entitled to an unlimited number of white CAV stickers. Green CAV stickers were initially available to a limited number of applicants that purchased or leased cars meeting California's Enhanced Advanced Technology Partial Zero Emission Vehicle (Enhanced AT PZEV) or Transitional Zero-Emission Vehicle (TZEV) requirements, for which plug-in hybrids classify. The green car sticker cap was increased several times, and since September 2016 the cap was removed.\n\nResearch performed in 2015 by the UCLA Luskin Center for Innovation found that access to HOV lanes has a significant impact on plug-in car sales. Researchers linked automobile sales to a sample of more than 7,000 of the 8,057 census tracts in California for the study, including Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Diego and San Francisco. The study concluded that the ability to use potentially time-saving HOV lanes prompted the purchase of more than 24,000 plug-in electric cars and hybrids in the four urban areas from 2010 to 2013, or about 40% of the total of such vehicles. The UCLA researcher concluded that without the policy giving plug-in vehicles access to HOV lanes, total plug-in sales in the same study areas would have been only 36,692 for the three-year period.\n\n, 37 states and Washington, D.C. have established incentives and tax exemptions for BEVs and PHEVs, or utility-rate breaks, and other non-monetary incentives such as free parking and high-occupancy vehicle lane access. All states are eligible for the $7,500 income tax credit.\n\nIn Australia, the Federal Government offers no direct incentives for electric vehicle ownership and imposes a substantial financial \"disincentive\" by way of a Federal Luxury Car Tax that is applied on new vehicles valued over a certain threshold (in 2014–15, this was A$61,884). The application threshold for this tax is increased to A$75,375 for fuel efficient vehicles - defined as those with a fuel consumption rating under 7 litres per 100 kilometres. By definition, electric vehicles which do not use conventional fuel sources are covered by this classification.\n\nMotor vehicle registrations in Australia are the responsibility of the state and territory governments. Two of these jurisdictions offer incentives or rebates for electric vehicles:\n\n\n\nElectric powered vehicles are entitled to 20% discount on registration. The owner pays 20% less on the cost of the annual registration component, however must pay the full fee for compulsory third party insurance, road rescue fee, road safety contribution.\n\nThere are no electric vehicle incentives in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania or the Northern Territory.\n\nElectric and hybrid vehicles are exempt from customs duties since 2017.\n\n\n"}

The case is notable because of the High Court's interpretation of the Flags, Emblems, and Names Protection Act 1981 in a manner consistent with the Bill of Rights Act 1990. Justice Ellen France held that \"the prohibition of flag burning under the Act was a breach of the right to freedom of expression, and such a limit was not justified under s 5 of the Bill of Rights.\"\n\nOn 10 March 2003 between 500 and 1000 people marched through central Wellington in protest at a visit of Australian Prime Minister John Howard to the New Zealand Parliament. The protest was against the Australian Government's support for the United States-led invasion of Iraq. During the protest Hopkinson held the New Zealand flag on a pole upside down and a Mr Phillips lit the flag with a cigarette lighter resulting in a fireball and a column of flame 2 metres high.\n\nAs a result of the protest, Wellington schoolteacher Paul Hopkinson became the first person ever to be prosecuted under the Flags, Emblems, and Names Protection Act 1981 after burning a New Zealand flag at an anti-war protest in March 2003. Hopkinson was convicted in November in the Wellington District Court of an offence under s 11(1)(b) of the Flags, Emblems, and Names Protection Act 1981; destroying the New Zealand flag with the intention of dishonouring it. Judge Noble ruled that Hopkinson had deliberately disrespected the flag to gain attention as he \"sought to add weight to the effects of the protest\".\n\nHopkinson appealed the conviction on the basis that the District Court had failed to correctly interpret the Flags, Emblems and Names Protection Act 1981 in a manner consistent with the right to freedom of expression and of peaceful assembly under ss 14 and 16 of the Bill of Rights Act 1990.\n\nSection 6 of the Bill of Rights required the Court to adopt a meaning of the word \"dishonour\" that could be read consistently with the Bill of Rights. Justice Ellen France held, [81] Looking at the statutory scheme as a whole, there is some support for the respondent's view that there is just the one tenable meaning, namely, that adopted by the District Court Judge. However, the better view is that the statute does allow of the narrower meaning of “vilify”. If that meaning is adopted, as s 6 of the Bill of Rights demands that it must, I consider s 11(1)(b) can be read consistently with the Bill of Rights. However, I do not accept the respondent's submission that the appellant's conduct would fall foul of this narrower definition of “dishonour”, that is, one limited to dishonour in the sense of vilifying. That would have required some additional action on the appellant's part beyond a symbolic burning of the flag. My decision is of course confined to this particular appellant's conduct. What other conduct may come within this narrower interpretation of “dishonour” is a matter for a different case.[82] On this basis, that is, that the prohibition on the appellant's conduct is not a justified limit on the right to freedom of expression and does not come within the proper Bill of Rights consistent interpretation of s 11(1)(b), the appellant's conviction cannot stand.\n\n"}

The question eventually went all the way to the Permanent Court of International Justice in the form of the Eastern Greenland Case in 1933.\n\nIn a meeting, Denmark agreed not to object to any claim to Spitsbergen which Norway might submit at an upcoming peace conference, if Norway would not oppose the Danish claim at the same conference to the whole of Greenland.

It was active from 1860 to World War II.\n\nItalian irredentists were citizens of Savoy who considered themselves to have ties with the House of Savoy dynasty. Savoy was the original territory of the duke of Savoy that later became King of Italy's House of Savoy. Since the Renaissance the area rules over Piedmont and had for regional capital the town of (Chambéry). The official language of Savoy was French since the 15th century, and was divided administratively in Savoie Propre (Chambéry), Chablais (Thonon), Faucigny (Bonneville), Genevois (Annecy), Maurienne (Saint Jean de Maurienne) and Tarentaise (Moûtiers).\nVaugelas, a native of the duchy became one of the most renowned French linguist.\n\nIn spring 1860 the area was annexed to France after a referendum and the administrative boundaries changed, but most of the Savoyard population demonstrated against the annexation. Indeed, the final vote count on the referendum announced by the Court of Appeals was 130,839 in favour of annexation to France, 235 opposed and 71 void, showing an unbelievable complete support for French nationalism (that motivated strong criticism about rigged results).\nAt the beginning of the year 1860, more than 3,000 persons demonstrated in Chambéry against the annexation to France rumours. On 16 March 1860, the provinces of Northern Savoy (Chablais, Faucigny and Genevois) sent to Victor Emmanuel II, to Napoleon III, and to the Swiss Federal Council a declaration - sent under the presentation of a manifesto together with petitions - where they were saying that they did not wish to become French and shown their preference to remain united to the Kingdom of Sardinia (or be annexed to Switzerland in the case a separation with Sardinia was unavoidable).\nGiuseppe Garibaldi complained about the referendum that allowed France to annex Savoy and Nice, and a group of his followers (between the Italian Savoyards) took refuge in Italy in the following years. With a 99.8% vote in favour of joining France, there were allegations of vote-rigging\n\nSome opposition to French rule was manifest when, in 1919, France officially (but contrary to the annexation treaty) ended the military neutrality of the parts of the country of Savoy that had originally been agreed to at the Congress of Vienna, and also eliminated the free trade zone - both treaty articles having been broken unofficially in World War I. France was condemned in 1932 by the international court for noncompliance with the measures of the treaty of Turin, regarding the countries of Savoy and Nice. Indeed, in 1871 a strong break away movement appeared in north and central Savoy against the annexation. The Republican Committee of the town of Bonneville considered that \"the 1860 vote, was the result of imperial pressure, and not the free demonstration of the will of our country\" and called for a new Referendum: France sent 10,000 troops to Savoy to restore order.\n\nIn the Kingdom of Italy was founded after 1861 the \"Associazione Oriundi Savoiardi e Nizzardi Italiani\"\n, an association of the Italian Savoyards that lasted one century until 1966.\n\nDuring the fascist period in the early 1940s, organizations were created that promoted the unification of Savoy to the Kingdom of Italy. The fascist members were nearly one hundred in 1942, concentrated mainly in Grenoble and Chambéry.\n\nWhen Italy occupied Savoy in November 1942 these fascist groups claimed that nearly 10,000 Savoyards demanded the unification to Italy, but nothing was done mainly because the King of Italy opposed it.\n\nAfter World War II all the organizations of the Irredentist Savoyards were outlawed by the French authorities of Charles de Gaulle.\n\nMost of the remaining Irredentist Savoyards supported in the 1950s and 1960s the development of autonomistic political organizations of Savoy, like the Mouvement Région Savoie (Savoy Regional Movement).\n\nOnly in 1940 did the Italian Savoyards fulfilled their irredentism, and some small areas bordering the Alps were annexed by Italy. The initial zone was 832 km² and contained 28,500 inhabitants.\n\nIn November 1942, in conjunction with \"Case Anton\", the German occupation of most of Vichy France, the Royal Italian Army (\"Regio Esercito\") expanded its occupation zone. Italian forces took control of Grenoble, Nice, the Rhône River delta, and nearly all of Savoy.\n\nA process of Italianization of the schools in Savoy was started, but was never fully implemented. Only a few Italian Savoyards were voluntarily enrolled in the Italian Army through fascist organizations like the Camicie Nere, most of them rejoined the resistance and fought against the invaders.\n\nMost of the Irredentist Savoyards helped actively the Jews in the occupied zone in Savoy, a region that acted as a refuge for Jews fleeing persecution in Vichy France during World War II.\n\nThe projects to unify Savoy to the Kingdom of Italy were supported by the fascist Savoyards of Grenoble, but nothing was done even because in September 1943 Nazi Germany substituted Italy in the occupation of Savoy.\n\nSavoyards historically have spoken a dialect related to the Arpitan language: the Savoyard dialect. Arpitan is spoken in France, in Switzerland and in Italy. However, French is the predominant language today.\n\nDuring the fascist occupation in 1940-1943, Italian authorities promoted a process of Italianization of all the people of Savoy, mainly related to the use of Italian in substitution of the Savoyard dialect.\n\n\n\n"}

Stinson Jr., a Democrat, on the 26th District Court.\n\nA graduate of Jena High School in Jena in Central Louisiana, Thompson obtained degrees in real estate and insurance from the University of Louisiana at Monroe (1988) and the Juris Doctor from Tulane University Law School in New Orleans (1995). He was affiliated with Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. While living in Monroe, he was from 1989 to 1992 the ULM (then Northeast Louisiana University) Associate Director of Development. He was also a reserve officer with the Monroe Police Department and an insurance agent for Troy & Nichols Mortgage Company. After obtaining his law degree with honors from Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana, he relocated to Bossier City to engage in the practice of law and is active in the bar association. He is a member of the large Cypress Baptist Baptist Church of Benton. He is affiliated with the National Rifle Association and was a district director of the Norwela Council of the Boy Scouts of America. In 2004, he was the president of the Bossier Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThompson and his wife, the former Toni Estelle Hurst, reside in Benton, the Bossier Parish parish seat, where the 26th Judicial District Court convenes. The couple has two children, Lillie and Rowe Thompson.\n\nThompson was elected to the House in 2011, when the term-limited incumbent, fellow Republican Jane H. Smith of Bossier City, ran instead, unsuccessfully, for the Louisiana State Senate. Thompson defeated fellow Republican, Michael Durrell \"Duke\" Lowrie (born April 1970), 4,991 (56.8 percent) to 3,803 (43.3 percent). Smith, meanwhile, was defeated by the Republican businessman Barrow Peacock of Shreveport for the Senate seat vacated by B. L. \"Buddy\" Shaw.\n\nIn 2008, Thompson was an unsuccessful candidate for the United States House of Representatives for Louisiana's 4th congressional district. The seat opened when the incumbent Jim McCrery stepped down to become a lobbyist. Thompson finished in third place in the primary. The position went to the Republican physician and businessman John C. Fleming of Minden, who held it until 2017.\n\nIn the spring of 2012, Representative Thompson amended an anti-bullying bill sponsored by Patricia Smith, a Democrat from Baton Rouge. Conservative opponents of the bill claimed the measure is at odds with freedom of speech rulings by the United States Supreme Court. Thompson offered an amendment, which removed those sections of the bill that specify prohibitions against bullying in regard to only sexual orientation, disabilities, and race. Smith said that the Thompson amendment effectively killed the focus of the legislation, and she withdrew it from further consideration. Thompson opposed bullying in schools for any reason and worked to protect the educational opportunities of all children.\n\nRepresentative Thompson served on the House Education, Homeland Security, Ways and Means, and Military and Veterans Affairs committees. He also sits on the Joint House and Senate Committee on Homeland Security. Thompson was a leader in the Louisiana legislature to address the over 17 millions pounds of propellant improperly and illegally stored at Camp Minden near Doyline, Louisiana.\n\nMike Johnson, a Republican lawyer from Benton, was unopposed in the special election held in February 2015 to choose Thompson's successor in the House. Johnson is not the U.S. representative for the 4th congressional district.\n\nIn 2017, plaintiffs James Wheat and Danny Brinson, after their arrests in Bossier City for violating a state statute forbidding panhandling, filled a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana against Bossier Parish Sheriff Julian Curtis Whittington and all judges of the 26th Judicial District Court, including Chief Judge Parker Self and Judge Thompson. Wheat and Brinson allege that Bossier Parish unjustly jails defendants who cannot pay for bail or the required $40 fee to the office of the public defender. Nor does Bossier Parish permit defendants to seek a lowering of the bail amount, which is instead automatically set by the court. The suit claims that the parish has for years violated a \"bedrock principle of our legal system that a person cannot be detained or imprisoned solely for their inability to pay a fee. Such an incarceration violates the substantive due process and equal protection clauses of the Constitution.\"\n"}

When at the academy, he was brutally assaulted and then expelled after being falsely accused and convicted of faking the incident. Over sixty years after his death, his name was formally cleared when he was posthumously commissioned by President Bill Clinton.\n\nWhittaker was born into slavery on the Chesnut Plantation in Camden, South Carolina. He studied privately with Richard Greener, the first African American to graduate from Harvard college. Whittaker later attended the University of South Carolina, then a freedmen's school. He was appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1876 after receiving an appointment from South Carolina Representative Solomon L. Hoge. For most of his time at West Point, he was the only black cadet, and he was ostracized by his white peers.\n\nIn the morning of April 5, 1880, he was found tied to his bed, unconscious, bleeding, and bruised. His hands and face had been cut by a razor, and burned pages from his Bible were strewn about his room. Whittaker told administrators that he had been attacked by three fellow cadets, but his account of the morning was not believed. West Point administrators said that he had fabricated the attack to win sympathy. Initially, Whittacker was held by a court of inquiry, where he was defended by Martin I. Townsend and his old friend, Richard Greener and finally granted a court-martial. After more than a year of nationally publicized hearings, Whittaker was found guilty in an 1881 court martial and expelled from West Point. The prosecuting attorney was West Point Judge Advocate Major Asa Bird Gardiner, later a Sachem of Tammany Hall in New York and disgraced New York District Attorney, who blatantly talked of the \"inferior\" and \"superior\" races and commented that \"Negroes are noted for their ability to sham and feign.\" His defense was led by Daniel Henry Chamberlain assisted by Greener. Though the verdict was overturned in 1883 by President Chester A. Arthur, West Point reinstated the expulsion on the grounds that Whittaker had failed an exam.\n\nIn his later life, Whittaker was a teacher, lawyer, high school principal in Oklahoma City, and psychology professor in South Carolina. He died in Orangeburg, South Carolina in 1931. Whittaker was buried at Orangeburg Cemetery.\nHis sons, Johnson Whittaker Jr. and Miller Whittaker, both served as Army officers in World War I. In addition, a grandson joined the all-black Tuskegee Airmen in World War II and a great-grandson served as a first lieutenant in the Vietnam-era Army.\n\nIn the 1970s, a book about Whittaker by John Marszalek, a historian at Mississippi State University, drew attention to his case. In 1994, a television movie based on the book aired, which generated momentum for the movement to award Whittaker a posthumous commission.\n\nOn July 25, 1995, President Bill Clinton awarded the commission to Whittaker's heirs, saying, \"We cannot undo history. But today, finally, we can pay tribute to a great American and we can acknowledge a great injustice.\"\n\n\"\" is a 1994 TV movie about the case.\n\"Matter of Honor\", a stage play by Michael Chepiga retelling Whittaker's story while at West Point, was produced at the Pasadena Playhouse in Pasadena, California, in September 2007.\n\n\n"}

Also, most countries recognize moral rights that are not alienable from the work, that is, a purchaser of rights in the work does not have the right to relabel it as if someone else had written it. While the USA does not recognize moral rights, it does have complex de facto standards such as the WGA screenwriting credit system which are actually more demanding and rigorous in specific industries.\n"}

Jim (1915) 26 C.C.C. 236, was a decision by the British Columbia Supreme Court on Aboriginal (\"Indian\") hunting and provincial game laws. The Court found that Aboriginal hunting on Indian reserves is primarily federal jurisdiction, relating to section 91(24) of the British North America Act, 1867 which assigns \"Indians, and Lands reserved for the Indians\" to the federal government.\n\nThe case involved an Aboriginal Chief named Edward Jim of the North Saanich tribe. In Victoria, British Columbia in 1914 a police magistrate convicted him of possession of a part of a deer in violation of the provincial Game Protection Act. Jim had hunted the deer on a reserve and used the meat in his home. Jim fought the charges against him by saying he had treaty rights, and that the British North America Act and federal Indian Act ensured the province could not apply this law to Aboriginals.\n\nJustice Hunter, on the BC Supreme Court, found that the conviction should be overturned. He pointed to section 91(24) of the British North America Act to note that \"Indians\" are under federal jurisdiction. The federal government had then enacted the Indian Act, and it stated that \"Indian lands\" are \"managed\" by the Governor in Council. Hunter interpreted the word \"managed\" to be broad in its application, and it should include governing hunting and fishing on reserves (Indian lands). Hunter also noted the federal government did regulate Aboriginal hunting in other provinces, suggesting it would have jurisdiction in British Columbia as well. The fact that there was no such regulation in British Columbia at the time possibly related to treaties.\n\nGenerally, provincial laws apply to Aboriginals. Provincial laws do not apply when they affect \"Indianness,\" primary Aboriginal issues. As constitutional scholar Peter Hogg writes, \"Hunting on a reserve is such a significant element of traditional Indian ways that it should probably be free of provincial regulation.\" He points to \"R. v. Jim\" to back this up. As for hunting outside reserves, the Supreme Court of Canada case \"Kruger and al. v. The Queen\" (1978) suggested this was not \"Indianness,\" whereas \"Dick v. The Queen\" (1985) suggested it was.\n\n\n"}

The office of such an official may be referred to as the deeds registry or deeds office. In the United States, the recorder of deeds is often an elected county office and is called the county recorder. In some U.S. states, the functions of a recorder of deeds are a responsibility of the county clerk (or the county's clerk of court), and the official may be called a clerk-recorder or recorder-clerk.\n\nThe recorder of deeds provides a single location in which records of real property rights are recorded and may be researched by interested parties. The record of deeds often maintains documents regularly recorded by the recorder of deeds, including deeds, mortgages, mechanic's liens, releases and plats, among others. To allow full access to deeds recorded throughout the office history, several indexes may be maintained, which include grantor–grantee indexes, tract indexes, and plat maps. Storage methods to record registry entries include paper, microform, and computer.\n\nThe principles of statutory, case, and common law are given effect by the recorder of deeds, insofar as it relates to vested ownership in land and other real rights. Because estate in land can be held in so many complex ways, a single deeds registry provides some clarity, even though it cannot \"guarantee\" those real property rights.\n\nThe legal certainty provided by a title deed issued under the registration of the recorder of deeds is of great significance to all parties who hold, or wish to acquire rights in real property. Certainty of title is the basis for the investment of massive amounts of money in real estate development for residential, commercial, industrial and agricultural use each year. This is why the meticulous recording of registration information by the recorder of deeds is so important.\n\nEach document recorded against title to real estate can be examined and the portion of the bundle of rights that it includes can be determined. These records can assist interested parties in researching the history of land and the chain of title for any property and purpose.\n\nThe Registry of Deeds exists in almost all cities and municipalities in the Philippines and it has a primary duty of registering and keeping all documents pertaining to transfer of real property and issuance of certificates of land title, whether original, transfer or condominium as well as chattel mortgage papers. The said agency is under the supervision of the Land Registration Authority, Department of Justice.\n\nThe South African system of deeds registry is unique in that it is associated with tenure security. When conveyancers transfer title, they are expected to follow rigid procedures which involve ensuring the title and the property comply with all the relevant legislation and regulations, leading to a high degree of certainty and accuracy. Recent concerns about the standard of legal education in South Africa, however, has raised concerns about whether this is still the case. The South African Registrar of Deeds is responsible for the national system of deeds offices which, through a juristic foundation and long-standing practices and procedures, has the effect of “guaranteeing” title.\n\nThe Deeds Registries Act and Sectional Titles Act are applied to regulate the deeds registry system, and form the foundation of land registration in South Africa.\n\nIn the U.S., most recorders of deeds are elected officials who serve the area of a county or equivalent jurisdiction.\n\nIn some states, the recorder of deeds may also act as a public posting place for documents that are not directly related to estates in land, such as corporate charters, military discharges, Uniform Commercial Code records, applications for marriage licenses, and judgments.\n\nDeeds in a few states of the U.S. are maintained under the Torrens title system or some limited implementation of it. (For example: Minnesota, some property in Massachusetts, Colorado, Hawaii, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, and Washington.)\n\nOther U.S. states maintain their deeds under common law; typically, they are filed in chronological order with a grantor/grantee index.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecording process:\n\nDirectory:\n\nOrganizations:\n\nSpecific offices:\n\nCommercial Online Providers:\n\nSoftware and Service Providers:\n\nSouth Africa:\n\nUkraine:\n"}

During World War I, German military law enabled military courts to try not only soldiers but also civilians held to have violated the military law. In the post-war Weimar Republic (1919-1933), the separate jurisdiction for military personnel was abolished by the law of 17 August 1920, based on Article 106 of the Weimar Constitution. \n\nAfter the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, courts-martial were reinstated by law of May 12, with effect from 1 January 1934.

By ordinance of 18 May 1940, proceedings against civilians were handed over to \"Sondergericht\" courts; from 29 January 1943, the \"People's Court\" (\"Volksgerichtshof\") had exclusive jurisdiction over all accusations of public \"Wehrkraftzersetzung\" and intentionally evading military service.\n\nThe President of the \"Reichskriegsgericht\" was able to affirm or to set aside a judgement; as was Hitler in his capacity as commander-in-chief of the Wehrmacht.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1215840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1215840", "title": "Replevin", "text": "Replevin\n\nReplevin () or claim and delivery (sometimes called revendication) is a legal remedy which enables a person to recover personal property taken wrongfully or unlawfully, pending a final determination by a court of law, and to obtain compensation for resulting losses.\n\nThe word \"replevin\" is of Anglo-Norman origin and is the noun form of the verb \"replevy\". This comes from the Old French \"replevir\", derived from \"plevir\" (\"to pledge\"), which is derived from the Latin \"replegiare\" (\"to redeem a thing taken by another\").\n\nIn \"The Law of Torts\", John Fleming has written:\n\nIn common law, several types of action existed with respect to deprivation of possession (being subdivided into the wrongful taking of chattels and the unjust detention of them, even where the original taking was lawful):\n\n\nAt common law, the ordinary action for the recovery of goods wrongfully taken was originally one of detinue, but no means of immediate recovery was possible until the action was tried. Replevin arose to deal with the matter of the illegal distress of goods for rent or \"damage feasant\", in order to procure their restoration to the owner. Illegal distress has been held to occur where:\n\n\nReplevin will not lie where if any part of the rent claimed was due, but this defence is not effective where the only rent claimed by the landlord is not recoverable by distress.\n\nIt has been held that replevin applies to any wrongful taking of goods and chattel.\n\nA party seeking relief may elect to adjudicate the right to possession prior to obtaining immediate relief to obtain the property in question. In such cases, replevin actions are still designed to afford the petitioning party a relatively speedy process for obtaining judgment, as compared to typical lawsuits. The summary remedy afforded by replevin statutes can be thwarted by defendants who contest the claimant's right to possession, by contesting the plaintiff's complaint, and insisting on traditional litigation involving discovery, and in some cases, trial by jury.\n\nReplevin actions are often filed by secured creditors seeking to take possession of collateral securing loans or other debt instruments, such as retail installment contracts. A common example is where an automobile finance company initiates a replevin action to gain possession of a vehicle, following payment default. Replevin actions are usually employed when the lender cannot find the collateral, or cannot peacefully obtain it through self-help repossession. Replevin actions may also be pursued by true owners of property, e.g., consignors seeking return of consigned property that the party in possession will not relinquish for one reason or another.\n\nReplevin is an action of civil law, not criminal law. Therefore, because of the differing burden of proof, a defendant found not guilty of criminal theft may nevertheless be required to return the disputed item or items in civil court.\n\nReplevin does not provide compensation for any monetary loss arising from the loss of use of some income-producing property item. Note also that replevin involves return of an actual specific item or items, not monetary compensation for loss. Thus, it would not normally be used in a case regarding a sum of money, as distinct from the loss of a rare coin, for instance, where the return of the actual coin itself was at issue. In occasional cases of no particular numismatic interest, however, \"e.g.,\" a bag of money whose contents have not yet been counted, an action may be filed to recover the actual coins and/or bills in question if they are still together.\n\nThe question of replevin becomes moot should the item in question no longer exist as an entity, \"i.e.\" if it is destroyed, or in the case of a bag of money, for instance, if the money has been spent. For this reason, the item is normally seized by the court when the action is filed and held until the decision is reached to prevent the waste of a legal action over a nonexistent object and, further, to ensure that the item in question is not destroyed, spent, etc., during the action. This can be used to force a settlement from the defendant, just or unjust, as he or she is deprived of the use of the disputed object for the duration of the action; if this results in a financial loss, the defendant may find it advantageous to merely pay a relatively small settlement and have the item returned quickly.\n\nReplevin remains the modern action, albeit defined by statute, for recovery of chattels pending a decision of the right of possession. It lies only where the possession was taken from the plaintiff, whether under colour of legal process or otherwise, by an act having the nature of a trespass.\n\nOne of the oldest actions in the royal courts, replevin had its roots in the law of customary courts, and its formal origin can be attributed to Glanvil, Chief Justiciar of England during the reign of Henry II (1154–1189). Strictly speaking, replevin in its original form was a provisional remedy. Its provision was to procure for the plaintiff the return of chattels taken out of his possession until the right to their possession could be decided by a court of law. No doubt, it was designed to avoid quarrels likely to cause a breach of the peace pending a settlement of the dispute about the right to possession. In other words, the rule of law was beginning to replace that of local force of arms and personal conflict as the resolution of disputes over chattels. The action was in direct succession to the efforts made to regulate self-help, which were the origin of the law of tort. The form of legal recourse was in connection of distress (\"distractio\"). This was the practice of taking some chattel from the peasant or underling until some action was performed. In the medieval era the services for which distress could be levied were numerous, since the incidents of tenure were then very numerous. Distress was also leviable as \"damage feasant\". When animals strayed and did damage to a neighbor, they could be retained until the damage was made good. Whether or not the distress was levied for rent or for livestock \"damage feasant\", the owner of the animals could obtain their release by giving \"gage and pledge\" – a form of security that the damage would be made good. One peculiarity of distraint lay in the fact that the distrainor did not get any form of legal possession. The goods and chattels were considered to be in the custody of the law. As a result, there was no taking of possession by the distrainor that was unlawful, since no possession was technically inferred.\n\nThe action in replevin began to appear in the thirteenth century. It seems clear that originally the action of replevin lay simply where the question to be determined was that of wrongful distress. Excess and abuse of distress was punished.\n\nSince the distrainor did not get possession he was not originally liable in trespass, and the spheres of the two forms of action remained distinct. During the fourteenth century, after some vacillation by judges, it was held that the plaintiff could elect which remedy he chose when the chattels had been distrained. It was also held that replevin could be used in place of the writ of \"trespass de bonis aspotatis\" (trespass by the asportation of goods). In reality, there is little evidence this substitution ever occurred with any frequency, if at all. The rule involved interference with the possession of a chattel by the rightful owner. In 1856, \"Mennie v. Blake\" summarized the law of replevin by stating, \"... it seems clear that replevin is not maintainable unless in a case in which there has been first a taking out of the possession of the owner. This stands upon authority and the reason of the thing\".\n\nThe mere claim by the distrainor that he had a right to the chattels distrained was a technicality that ended the action in replevin. It was then necessary to re-file using a new writ invented in the early fourteenth century, called the writ \"de proprietate probanda\" – a writ \"concerning the proof of ownership\".\n\nDuring the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the action of trover also arose, which largely replaced that of trespass in the matter of wrongful distress. Replevin and trover never completely coincided, because there was a limitation on replevin.\n\nUntil the Common Law Procedure Act 1854 came into effect in England and Wales, a defendant was able to exercise an option of paying damages instead of restoring the actual goods.\n\nSection 65 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 made provision for the common law rules governing replevin in England and Wales to be replaced, although this provision did not become effective until 6 April 2014.\n\nReplevin actions are common and fall into two types of action: if immediate possession of the property is sought and if the party filing the action is content to wait for an adjudication of final rights. In a case in which immediate possession of property is sought, the petitioning creditor is often required to post a bond to protect the defendant against wrongful detention. That approach can be a very powerful weapon in a case of someone holding property wrongly because it deprives the holder of the use of the property while the case is awaiting trial, thereby putting pressure on the holder to settle the matter quickly.\n\nThis replevin process falls into two stages:\n\nReplevin is used when the party having the right of property cannot simply invoke self-help and take the property back. If the party has the ability to do so directly, the action is referred to as repossession. For example, in the states of Wisconsin and Louisiana, if a person who finances an automobile, becomes a registered owner of that vehicle and fails to make payments as agreed, the lienholder cannot simply repossess the vehicle. The lienholder must go to court and obtain an order of replevin.\n\nIn many cases, parties initiating a replevin action will elect not to gain immediate possession of the collateral or other wrongfully-held property and will instead file the replevin action without posting a bond. Once service of process is achieved, the defendant will likely be required to attend a court hearing on a specific date, then the parties' rights to possession will be adjudicated. A plaintiff creditor can typically prevail in the case by offering testimony and business records showing the borrower/defendant's obligation to pay, and default in payment. The Court will thereafter issue a judgment and authorize issuance of a writ of replevin, which is served by a sheriff's deputy, working in conjunction with persons hired or employed by the creditor to take the collateral or other property into its possession. The sheriff's role is to keep the peace and allow the creditor to get its property, without threat from the borrower. Once the creditor takes the property into its possession, it can sell the collateral, and apply the proceeds to the debt owed by the borrower.\n\nIn other cases, replevy is used to prevent damages that may occur from the continued use of an item, such as a public utility meter. In the case of non-payment of a public utility, a meter is typically left on the premise to allow reconnection should the balance due be paid, or if the person owing the bill sells the premise to another person who does not owe arrears to the utility, however, it is possible for one to reconnect the device and continue obtaining the commodity in question. In such cases, the utility could seek replevin for the utility meter itself, thereby preventing this practice.\n\nIn the 1899 case of \"McGregor v. McGregor\", Irving J of the British Columbia Supreme Court wrote:\n\nProvisions analogous to replevin in the case of distraint are found in the Civil Code of Quebec and St Lucia (arts. 1888 et seq.), which was reproduced in substance from French law, which is also in force in Mauritius. There are analogous provisions in the Spanish Civil Code (art. 1922).\n\nSimilar provisions are also found in:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In January 1977, Annie Walsh was beaten to death in her home in Manchester, England and Brown was first interrogated and beaten by the police officers investigating this crime. Under duress, Brown signed a confession and was found guilty at trial. He maintained his innocence throughout his prison sentence even going so far as denying himself parole by not admitting to the crime. He was released on appeal in 2002 and is thought to be one of the longest serving victims of a miscarriage of justice in the United Kingdom.\n\nBrown grew up in Kilbowie in Dumbartonshire and was placed into care when he was nine years old by his mother after he witnessed his dad beating her up. At the age of 15 he took himself out of care and returned home where he and his father \"came to blows\". His dad threw him out soon afterwards. Brown admits that he partook in a life of petty crime. He later moved to Manchester to make \"a fresh start\" after going to a football match in the city. Whilst in Manchester he met a girl, Cathy Shaw, who later became his girlfriend.\n\nOn 31 January 1977, factory worker Annie Walsh, who was 51 at the time, was found battered to death in her flat in Charles Berry Crescent, Hulme, Greater Manchester by a man who had come to read the electricity meter. She had been hit over the head sixteen times and her blood was splattered over the furniture, walls and ceiling. A Home Office pathologist estimated that she had lain undiscovered for two to three days after the murder, (she was last seen alive on 28 January 1977). Police were so concerned about the frenzied nature of the attack that they consulted mental units in case someone had escaped.\n\nIn May 1977, the police went to the flat that Brown shared with his girlfriend Cathy; it was in the same block of flats where Annie Walsh had lived and been murdered. He was originally arrested for non-payment of a fine and was taken in for questioning without his rights being read to him and held for 32 hours without legal representation. At the trial, Brown stated that the confession was beaten and coerced out of him and when he did ask for a lawyer, he was told by the policemen that \"only guilty men need a lawyer\".\n\nThe trial was presided over by Judge Helenus Milmo who directed the jury's attention to the fact that it came down to whether or not they believed the police, or whether they believed Brown was innocent. The jury convicted Brown of murder and Judge Milmo sentenced him to life with a minimum term of 15 years.\n\nBrown appealed the sentencing in 1978, but the appeal was turned down. An appeal was lodged again with then Home Secretary, Michael Howard in 1993, but this was also denied in the following year.\n\nWhilst in prison, Brown was caught in what Simon Hattenstone, writing in The Guardian, describes as \"the Miscarriage of Justice Catch-22\" (the Innocent prisoner's dilemma); because he would not admit his guilt in the crime for which he was imprisoned, he could not be rehabilitated and be deemed fit to be put in front of a parole board. Brown refused the chance of parole from a point of view that investigative journalist Eamonn O'Neill called a point of logic; \"how could he be paroled for a crime that he did not commit?\".\n\nWhilst in prison, Brown shared a cell with Paul Hill, one of the Guildford Four, who, after having his conviction quashed and then released, later campaigned against Brown's miscarriage of justice. The case was again referred to the Court of Appeal in 2002 by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC).\n\nAn appeal court in November 2002 decided that Brown should be allowed to go free after declaring his conviction unsafe. The appeal was due to be heard over two days, but the judges at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, quashed the conviction within minutes when the Counsel for the Crown explained that he could not argue the case on the evidence presented before the court; the appeal lasted only 18 minutes before it was deemed an 'unsafe conviction'. \n\nThe appeal court had heard evidence that the fibres on Walsh's coat had not matched to Brown, but to another man who was questioned about the murder at the same time. This evidence was not given in court. Linguistic analysis of Brown's confession was given in evidence stating that it could not have been dictated to the police officers by Brown as the police had said. A pair of blood-soaked jeans had also been used against Brown in his interrogation with the police claiming they were the ones that Brown had used in the murder. In fact, they belonged to a woman who had suffered a miscarriage in them and the police knew this. The sight of the jeans being presented in court made Brown burst into tears as he had known the woman who had had the miscarriage in them; this was misinterpreted as guilt of the murder on his part by the people in the court.\n\nThe three judges presiding over Brown's 2002 appeal heard evidence which, in their summing up, prompted them to describe the arresting officers in Brown's case to be part of a \"culture of corruption and a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice\".\n\nDetective Superintendent Peter Topping of Greater Manchester Police had written a report in the 1980s detailing corruption practices within the force during the 1970s and beyond. Despite the report containing circumstantial evidence that could have alleviated Brown's time in prison, it was not made available to his legal team until a few days before the Court of Appeal quashed his conviction because of a Public-Interest Immunity certificate concerning the report.\n\nSince his release, Brown has been campaigning for reforms to the legal system. He was also given compensation for his 25-year prison sentence, of which the government demanded back £100,000 for which they deemed payment for bed and board whilst he was in prison. Brown is believed to be one of the longest serving victims of a miscarriage of justice in the United Kingdom.\n\nCathy Shaw, Brown's girlfriend in 1977, died in 1992 at the age of 35 from alcohol poisoning. Brown and Shaw's family both attribute her death to how his conviction affected her.\n\nIt was later revealed that Brown could not take legal action against any of the police officers who were responsible for his fake confession or beatings. An investigation found \"insufficient evidence\" of misconduct in relation to Brown's detention, interviews or arrest. Detective Chief Inspector Jack Butler was sentenced to four years in jail after being found guilty of accepting bribes and perverting the course of justice in 1983, but that was in relation to another case not related to Robert Brown's. At Brown's Court of Appeal hearing in 2002, his defending counsel said of Butler that \"not only was he involved in corruption himself but he presided over a conspiracy of corruption amongst other officers at Platt Lane police station [in Fallowfield, Manchester] between 1973 and 1979.\" Butler resigned from the police force in 1983.\n\nIn September 2004, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) informed Robert Brown that there would be no prosecution of the police officers involved in his arrest and interrogation. In the same year, Channel 4 screened a documentary about Brown's case which was entitled \"Picking Up the Pieces\". A review in The Guardian described it as \"searing stuff\".\n\nIn early 2005, Greater Manchester Police announced that they had reopened the investigation into Annie Walsh's murder.\n\n"}

The fabric was, in the past, presented as a gift of honour (\"Mana Phee\") to the soldiers for their bravery in a successful war, and to the praise-worthy chiefs of the Nagas of Manipur by the king of Manipur. It is a product which is protected under the GI registration and is now made throughout the Indian state of Manipur.\n\nThe fabric has been registered for protection under the Geographical indication of the Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement. It was registered as \"Shaphee Lanphee\" under the Geographical Indications Act 1999 of the Government of India, with registration confirmed by the Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks under Class – 25 – Clothing vide application number 371 dated 19 December 2011, and also for Wangkhei Phee (GI no.372) and Moirang Phee (GI no.373). The Government of Manipur was expected to register 1,000 weavers in respect of manufacturing Shaphee Lanphee within six months from the date of registration as per decision of the Consultative Committee meeting.\n\nThe literal meaning of the fabric 'Shaphee' is \"the fabric of animal and war\". It is exclusivity a product of Khoisnam lineage. It is said that the king saw a man of Khoisnam clan wearing this Shaphee Lanphee and riding a horse. The king then adopted it as a form of honouring brave Naga Chiefs of Manipur. According to manuscript titled \"Loiyumba Silyen\", King Loiyumba (1074–1122 AD) authorised this product to be woven by the Khoisnam family. The product was revived in the 20th century with the efforts of Maisnam Nalini Devi, a weaver from Wangkhei Yonglan, her sister Maisnam Anita and their mother Keinahanbi who had both won the state award in 1992 for promoting this product. Nalini also won the Master Crafts Person award in 2009 for promoting this craft.\n\nShaphee Lamphee embroidery is done over a black coloured cloth with red border. The motifs embroidered on the fabric consists of several designs, and some of the common designs adopted are: of animals such as \"\"shamu\" (elephant), \"shagol\" (horse), \"iroichi\" (buffalo horn), \"wahong\" (peacock), and \"Nga\" (fish); planets such as \"numit\"\" (sun), \"tha\" (moon); \"Thawanmichak\" (star) ; and also \"phantup\" (magical seat, \"ta\" (spear) – these designs are done in a set pattern and sequence of operation. The embroidery is done by hand using needle and yarns of cotton. It has a width of 110–132 cm and length of 225–230 cm and generally weighs 1854 grams. The yarn used are 2/20S cotton and 2/34S acrylic with wrap made with 2/20S cotton and weft woven from 2/20S cotton. The yarn used in embroidery is 2/20S cotton, mercerized and 2/40S.\n\nThe fabric is revered for its religious significance in view of the motifs crafted on them. The core part of the fabric has red colour representing sun, the white strips at both borders denoting the cosmos of sky and the stars, and symbols of moon and sun assigned to mother and father. Some of these motifs are indicative of relationship between the celestial bodies and the Meitei King; particularly the magical seat and the elephant linked to the royalty and the spear heads and the fishes indicative of the mythology of king Naothingkhong (663–763 AD).\n\nThe yarn used to make the fabric is a derivative of \"Lashing\" (Cotton ball) and “Kabrang” (Mulberry cocoon). These are also extracted from the bark of the tree species locally known as \"Santhak\" (\"Urtica sp.\"). The local fibre is then made into threads by spinning and then dyed using plants and bark. The dyed yarn is subject to sizing by applying starch made of rice, and then stretched across using a bamboo rod which is followed by winding into bobbin.\n\nWeaving of the fabric is done on a \"Loin and Frame Loom\" and motifs are made with needle work without frame using Manipuri cotton or occasionally silk threads.\n\nIn order to exercise quality control of the product made by weavers, following the GI registration of the fabric, an inspection agency has been instituted with nine members drawn from the government departments, societies and master craftsmen.\n"}
{"id": "2932451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2932451", "title": "South Korean nationality law", "text": "South Korean nationality law\n\nSouth Korean nationality law defines who is a South Korean citizen, as well as the procedures by which one may be naturalized into South Korean citizenship or renounce it.\n\nSouth Korean nationality is automatically acquired in a number of ways:\n\n\nUnder the Constitution of South Korea, North Korean citizens are also recognized as South Korean nationals. However, in practice, a formal evaluation needs to take place which requires documentary proof of North Korean nationality. Additionally, North Korean citizens do not have automatic protection from South Korea per se, since those with criminal histories are not accepted as South Korean citizens.\n\nSeparate from the Nationality Law, the Overseas Koreans Law defines the term \"Overseas Korean\" as referring to South Korean nationals who reside overseas as well as \"Koreans with a Foreign Nationality.\" The latter group is composed of former South Korean nationals who gave up their South Korean nationality (but barring those who did so to deliberately evade military service, at least until age 36) and children and grandchildren of former South Korean nationals. It is important to note that not every descendant of a South Korean can be counted as an \"Overseas Korean\" or \"Korean with a Foreign Nationality\" under this law. For example, a 25-year-old man who was born a South Korean national overseas but whose birth was unreported will have no documentation to prove his status as a former South Korean national, and can only gain status as an Overseas Korean if one of his parents or grandparents gave up South Korean nationality. Also, those who fall under Article 7 of the Addenda (Special Cases of Acquisition of Nationality for Persons of Maternal Line By Adoption of Jus Sanguinis to Both Lines of Parents) but failed to acquire South Korean nationality are not able to gain the status of an Overseas Korean unless the mother or a maternal grandparent has lost South Korean nationality.\n\nKoreans in Japan who have South Korean nationality and Special Permanent Residence in Japan do not have a Resident registration number and cannot apply for a new passport from a South Korean embassy while outside Japan.\n\nThere are three types of naturalization under South Korean law:\n\n\nThose who acquire South Korean nationality by naturalization normally must give up foreign nationality within six months or forfeit South Korean nationality. An exception to this is draft-age males, who must complete or be exempted from military service before being allowed to forfeit Korean nationality.\n\nThe first person to naturalize as a South Korean citizen was a Taiwanese immigrant in 1957. From then until 2000, there were an average of just 34 naturalizations per year. In the decade that followed, these numbers increased sharply to an average of 9,816 per year, and by January 2011 the cumulative number of naturalized citizens over the years had reached 100,000. Chinese immigrants formed 79% of these, followed by Vietnamese (9.2%), Filipinos (5.2%), and Taiwanese (2.1%).\n\nFormer South Korean nationals can reacquire South Korean nationality by applying for reacquisition of nationality. However, this will reinstate the military service duty, if applicable to the national, and also requires forfeiting any foreign nationality within 6 months.\n\nVisa requirements for South Korean citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of Republic of Korea. In 2014, South Korean citizens have visa-free or visa on arrival access to 172 countries and territories, ranking the South Korean passport 3rd in the world according to the Visa Restrictions Index.\n\nIn 2010, the South Korean government legalized dual citizenship for some South Koreans who have acquired another nationality/citizenship, as well as foreigners who lived in South Korea for five years (two years if married to a South Korean).\n\nA revised nationality law passed on 21 April 2010, by the National Assembly of South Korea and in effect since 1 January 2011, granted a limited number of persons dual citizenship.\n\nThese persons include:\n\n\nThere are transitional provisions for those who fit under the first category but had already forfeited one nationality.\n\n\nAs of December 2010, an application for dual citizenship can only be made inside the Republic of Korea and requires the applicant to currently hold an F-series visa. This would normally be an F-5 visa (Permanent Residency) or an F-4 visa (for former Korean nationals and their descendants, including Korean adoptees) or F-2 or F-6 visa (for spouses of Korean nationals). In the case of South Korean adoptees living abroad (e.g., in the U.S.), application to restore Korean citizenship, and thus obtain dual nationality, shall only be made while living in the Republic of Korea.\n\nDual citizenship holders:\n\nSouth Korea's first nationality law, Law No. 16, was enacted by the 1st Constituent Assembly, and took effect on 20 December 1948. The most recent total amendment of the law, Law No. 8435, was enacted by the 17th National Assembly and took effect on 17 May 2007.\n\nPrior to 2011, the South Korean government did not permit dual citizenship after the age of 21. Koreans with dual citizenship under South Korean law who work or study in South Korea were legally obliged by South Korea to choose one or the other citizenship soon after reaching that age.\n\nIn addition, South Korean men over the age of 18, including men born overseas to a parent with South Korean citizenship, were subject to compulsory military service in the South Korean armed forces. From a law that was effective since 2005, a male dual citizen could not be allowed to abandon his South Korean citizenship until he finished his military service, or had received a special exemption from military service. In several cases, American men of South Korean descent had been drafted into the South Korean army upon visiting the country, despite having never been to South Korea before.

In full, it was entitled an \"Act how aged, poor and impotent Persons, compelled to live by Alms, shall be ordered; and how Vagabonds and Beggars shall be punished.”\n\nUnder this act, vagabonds were subject to the harsher punishment of whipping, rather than the stocks. However, it also created provisions for those who were unable to work due to sickness, age, or disability. These \"impotent\" beggars could become licensed to beg by their local Justices of the Peace. For this reason, this statute is recognized as the first English poor law to be at least partially aimed at providing relief, rather than punishing vagrancy, because it made the Justices of the Peace responsible for the licensed poor within their district.\n"}

The idea is to make file sharing networks subscribe-only for a small fee and then distribute the collected money among the artists based on the popularity of their work. It has been endorsed since 2003 by the EFF. \n\nArguably Spotify is an implementation of this idea, although it is not marketed as a file-sharing network and also allows ad-supported free use in addition to paid use.\n\n\n\n"}
