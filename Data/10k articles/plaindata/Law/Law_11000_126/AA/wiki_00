It is seen also as an attempt to put pressure on Liechtenstein, one of the remaining uncooperative tax havens, as identified by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Money Laundering of the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, along with Andorra and Monaco, in 2007.\n\nMillions of euros belonging to hundreds of citizens living in Germany were channeled into the LGT Bank and other banks in Liechtenstein, taking advantage of Liechtenstein-based trusts to evade paying taxes in Germany. According to the prosecutor's office these trusts \"have been created apparently only to evade paying taxes.\" According to the law in Liechtenstein, such trusts allow the separation of monetary assets from their owners and are kept anonymously. In contrast to trusts of most other countries, Liechtenstein trusts can be revoked at any time and the assets will be returned to the owner. Furthermore, such trusts as well as their maintaining shell entities are only charged 0.1% (minimum 1,000 Swiss francs) annually. Liechtenstein thus is known to be a tax haven.\n\nAccording to the lead prosecuting office responsible for economic crime in Bochum, which is supported by prosecuting offices in other towns as well as the criminal police, currently about 600 to 700 individuals are suspected in the investigations. In addition, search warrants have been issued. An official confirmation about the total number of suspects and amount of money involved has not yet been issued. According to the prosecutors, current investigations provide a \"very high level of evidence.\"\n\nThe affair became known on February 14, 2008, when a raid was conducted against Klaus Zumwinkel, the chief executive of Deutsche Post AG, under the suspicion that he evaded about 1 million € ($1.46 million) in taxes. Pressured by the government, Zumwinkel resigned from his position. Similarly a number of other individuals have been under investigation for months, and the appearance that the well-to-do have ways and means to evade the German tax laws has caused complaints about inequality.\n\nAccording to a report by the \"Süddeutsche Zeitung\", Heinrich Kieber, a bank computer technician, sold a CD with incriminating bank information to the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND, English: Federal Intelligence Service), which handed the material over to the tax investigation office in Wuppertal. Kieber was paid €4.2 million by the Federal Ministry of Finance for the data on which the investigation is based. Facing death threats, the informant is currently in hiding and has asked for police protection. Kieber is wanted by Interpol. The \"Wall Street Journal\" indicated on February 19, 2008, the name of the informant who apparently lives now in Australia and had sold the data to tax ministries of a number of countries, including the United States.\n\nA number of raids were conducted in Hamburg, Munich, Frankfurt and other cities. Several banks were searched including Bankhaus Metzler, the Hauck & Aufhäuser bank, Dresdner Bank, UBS in Munich and the Berenberg Bank in Hamburg. In the meantime revenue offices also noted a higher number of voluntary self-incriminations - this will avoid or reduce punitive damages - for possible tax evasions by people with financial assets in Liechtenstein.\n\nWhile the BND received the data in 2006, the LGT Group indicated that in 2002 secret information had been stolen but the informant had been caught and tried in 2003, and all material had been returned.\n\nThe informant also had sold data to the government of the United States. After the affair broke open, Senator Carl Levin, chairman of a senate investigations committee, indicated his intention to probe to what degree American citizens have used the LGT bank to evade taxes. In July 2008 the U.S. Subcommittee determined that the offshore tax haven saved $100 billion per year for the U.S. taxpayer. Specifically mentioned were Switzerland's UBS AG and Liechtenstein's LGT Group. The report indicates that the LGT Group contributed to a \"culture of secrecy and deception\". According to the report UBS holds 1,000 declared accounts versus 19,000 that are not declared to the IRS. The report recommended a number of steps including tighter regulations for financial institutions.\n\nAccording to the LGT Bank some 20 Finns had evaded tax in Finland via accounts containing €50-60 million in deposited funds. This was the largest known tax avoidance case in Finland. Most names are secret. According to Helsingin Sanomat in Sept/Oct 2013 Lichtenstein tax havens accounts include funds of Casimir Ehrnrooth (see UPM, YIT, Jaakko Pöyry and Guggenheim Helsinki Plan) Bertel Paulig (coffee, spices) and a construction company owners in Turku.\n\nSeventeen Finns paid additional taxes totalling €10 million. The taxpayers initiated actions in the Administrative Court. The decisions are not public. According to Finnish law the cost of hidden taxes can be up to 30%. In two cases shown for the reporters the administrative Court acted ca 1% interest rate payment. In one case hidden funds were in total €483.000 and acted additional tax was €4.350. In addition to this, tax payers must pay the avoided taxes and an interest of the tax funds not paid in time. According to the Supreme Administrative Court of Finland no other legal procedures are possible, than collecting the hidden tax and its 1% interest rate.\n\nOn February 24, 2008, it became apparent that secret bank information had also been sold to the British tax authorities and that about 100 individuals in the UK are at risk for investigations for tax evasion.\nThe informant also provided the governments of Australia, Canada and France with data. On February 26 it became known that the German government was willing to share relevant data of the about 4,500 accounts with other governments; two third of these accounts belong to accounts of non-German individuals or entities. Fiscal authorities in Ireland, Belgium, Finland, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden indicated interest, and while the Danish government initially declined - it considered the material to have been stolen - it appears to have reversed its position. The governments of the Czech Republic and Spain have also announced investigations derived from Germany's list. India, however, has thus far not considered Germany's offer despite reports that many wealthy Indian citizens might have accounts in the bank.\n\nThe principality of Liechtenstein is directly affected by the affair as the LGT Bank is owned by the reigning princely family of Liechtenstein. The affair overshadowed the previously planned visit of Otmar Hasler, the Prime Minister of Liechtenstein, to Berlin on February 19, 2008, to meet with the Minister of Finance, Peer Steinbrück, and the Chancellor, Angela Merkel. Merkel asked for help in the investigation and cooperation in prevention of tax evasion, pointing out that Liechtenstein provided the US Internal Revenue Service with some data but not the German Ministry of Finances.\n\nThe newspaper \"Die Welt\" described the event as a \"government crisis\". The Regent of Liechtenstein, Alois, Hereditary Prince of Liechtenstein, called the investigations an \"attack\" on Liechtenstein by the Federal Republic and is considering legal remedies. The German government has been criticized for working with secret bank data that was stolen by the informant.\nThe head prosecutor of Liechtenstein Robert Wallner initiated an indictment \"against unknown perpetrators for the violation of company secrets for a foreign country\". Also, two lawyers in Berlin initiated lawsuits against the BND and the Federal government claiming among others \"infidelity toward the taxpayer\" and \"spying of data\".\n\nThe German government, on the other hand, is considering a coordinated international action: according to internal sources of the Ministry of Finances Liechtenstein supposedly lives to \"a good part from the business of evading taxes\". The government may consider a number of possible actions: Liechtenstein is about to join the Schengen Agreement which would eliminate its border controls towards Austria, and Germany's consent is required; Germany could impose fees on transfers of currency, place taxes on business activities of its citizens in Liechtenstein, and require them to prove that their activities there are legitimate. Furthermore, it counts on the support of other governments who also feel the sting of tax evasion.\n\nQuestions have also been raised within Germany as to the internal legality of the matter. Concerns have been voiced that the actions taken by BND were outside the agency's national security (and constitutional) remit, with attention also focusing on the wider ethical debate as to whether BND was justified in paying a €4m bribe to a bank official in a foreign country (with financing and approval from both the German chancellery and finance ministry). In March 2009 Germany announced that it will not grant judicial assistance to Liechtenstein in the prosecution of the assumed perpetrator, claiming Ordre public overrides its duty to do so under the European Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement.\n\nLiechtenstein entered negotiations with a number of countries to discuss tax avoidance issues. It reached an agreement with the United Kingdom in 2009 that will allow the about 5,000 British customers of Liechtenstein's banks that hold for them about ₤2-3 billion in secret accounts to come clear with British tax authorities under terms of a significantly reduced penalty. The agreement would open up Liechtenstein's banks to greater transparency, but remains controversial in Liechtenstein; some banks fear that clients will just move their money elsewhere.\n\n"}

Montana, is a Montana Supreme Court case, argued on September 2, 2009, and decided on December 31, 2009, that addressed the question of whether the state's constitution guaranteed terminally ill patients a right to lethal prescription medication from their physicians. The Montana Supreme Court sidestepped the question of if medical aid in dying is guaranteed under Montana State Constitution, but it instead ruled, on narrower grounds, that neither legal precedent nor the state's statute deem such assistance to be against public policy or illegal. Montana is one of seven states in which aid in dying is authorized. The others are California, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, Hawaii and Vermont: it is authorized in the District of Columbia as well.\n\nThe original lawsuit was brought by four Montana physicians (Stephen Speckart, C. Paul Loehnen, Lar Autio, and George Risi, Jr., M.D.s), Compassion & Choices and Robert Baxter, a seventy-six-year-old truck driver from Billings, Montana, who was dying of lymphocytic leukemia. The plaintiffs asked the court to confirm a constitutional right \"to receive and provide aid in dying\". The state argued that \"the Constitution confers no right to aid in ending one’s life.\" Judge Dorothy McCarter, of Montana's First Judicial District Court, ruled in favor of the plaintiffs on December 5, 2008, stating that the \"constitutional rights of individual privacy and human dignity, taken together, encompass the right of a competent terminally-ill patient to die with dignity.\" Baxter died that same day.\n\nThe Montana Attorney General appealed the case to the state supreme court. Oral arguments were heard on September 2, 2009.\n\nAmicus briefs filed on behalf of those asking the court to grant the constitutional right to receive/provide aid in dying include human rights groups, women's rights groups, The American Medical Women's Association/American Medical Students Association, clergy, legal scholars, thirty-one Montana state legislators and bioethicists, among others.\n\nAmong the groups filing amicus briefs on behalf of the state were the Alliance Defense Fund on behalf of the Family Research Council, Americans United for Life, the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, disability rights group Not Dead Yet, and the Catholic Medical Association. \n\nThe Montana Medical Association issued a statement opposing physician-assisted suicide, but refused to file an \"amicus brief\" in the appeal.\n\nOn Dec. 31, 2009, the Montana Supreme Court ruled in favor of Baxter. Although they did not address the constitutional question, they ruled on narrower grounds saying that \"nothing in Montana Supreme Court precedent or Montana statutes indicating that physician aid in dying is against public policy.\" \n\nSince the Montana Supreme Court chose only to rule on statutory grounds, groups opposed to medical aid in dying have since tried to overturn the decision at the legislature. Likewise proponents of aid in dying have sought to have the detailed provisions found in other states codified.\n\nIn 2013, Montana Doctor Eric Kress, M.D. became the first physician to speak publicly about providing aid in dying for qualified patients who request the medication.And in 2015 Erwin Byrnes became the first patient to speak publicly about his plans to take the medication, saying “We have to be kind of the driver of our own bus.”\n\nIn 2015 The Journal of Palliative Medicine published Clinical Criteria for Physician Aid in Dying for doctors to use as guidance in states like Montana, where provisions are not detailed in statute.\n\n"}

It is often used to refer to the valuation of such client following.\n\nSince most U.S. law firms are organized as limited liability partnerships or professional corporations, each partner is usually responsible for cultivating his or her own clients in that partner's specific area of focus, e.g. litigation, tax or securities. In the competitive legal market, especially in large city markets, partners are evaluated by committees of their fellow partners with assistance of non-legal market and financial professionals both in-house and outside the firm on a yearly basis and set guidelines on billable targets. An equity partner with a stagnant or declining book of business can be \"de-equitized\" or demoted from the status of a partner who receives a share of the firm's profits to that of a salaried partner or counsel.\n\nFirms seeking to expand often retain outside legal recruiters and specify the minimum book of business they require for a lateral candidate, usually between $1–$3 million in larger legal markets. When a partner resigns from his or her law firm, American Bar Association and local bar rules require his or her clients to be notified, giving them a chance to decide whether to follow the lawyer to the new firm, or stay. Given the fierce competition among law firms in the past 20 years, anecdotal reports suggest that partners are informing their clients before handing in their resignations to determine how much of their business is portable.\n\nA conflict of interest check is also an important step before a book of business can be considered portable. For example, a partner whose primary clients are insurance policyholders would generally be unable to take most of his book of business to a firm that represents insurers.\n\n\n"}

It is an aggravated form of dangerous driving. It is currently created by section 1 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (as substituted by the Road Traffic Act 1991).\n\nSection 1 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (as substituted by section 1 of the Road Traffic Act 1991), creates the offences of causing death by dangerous driving:\n\nSee Dangerous driving#\"Dangerously\"\n\nCausing death by dangerous driving is an indictable-only offence.\n\nA person convicted of causing death by dangerous driving is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years. Disqualification for a minimum of two years is obligatory on conviction. Endorsement is obligatory on conviction. The offence carries three to eleven penalty points (when the defendant is exceptionally not disqualified).\n\nThe Court of Appeal in R v Cooksley and others gave guidelines for cases where death is caused by dangerous driving. In R v Richardson the Court of Appeal reassessed the starting point set out in R v Cooksley taking into consideration the increase in the maximum penalty. The relevant starting points identified in Cooksley should be reassessed as follows: \n\nWhen a court disqualifies a person on conviction for causing death by dangerous driving, it must order an extended retest.\n\nPart I of Schedule 2 to the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988 originally provided that a person convicted of this offence was liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years. It was amended by section 67(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 1993 on 16 August 1993 so as to increase the maximum term to ten years.\n\nThe Road Safety Act 2006 introduced two new offences, of \"causing death by careless, or inconsiderate driving\" and a distinct offence for causing (any) death by driving when unlicensed, or disqualified.\n\nThis offence was formerly created by section 1 of the Road Traffic Act 1972. But it was abolished by section 50 of the Criminal Law Act 1977.\n\nIn New South Wales and Western Australia, \"Dangerous driving occasioning death\" is an equivalent to \"Causing death by dangerous driving\".\n\nThe person's driving privileges, in Western Australia, will be suspended for at least 2 years, from the date of conviction. Should any of the following \"Circumstances of aggravation\" be proven, in a trial for dangerous driving occasioning death, it is possible for the driver to receive a prison sentence of up to and including 20 years:\n\nIf a defendant is tried in District Court for dangerous driving occasioning death, but none of the circumstances of aggravation can be proven, the maximum imprisonment is 10 years. A conviction in Magistrates Court can result in imprisonment of up to and including 3 years.\n\nIn NSW, the maximum term of imprisonment, for a conviction of dangerous driving occasioning death, is:\n\nThe equivalent, in Queensland, to \"Causing death by dangerous driving\", is \"Dangerous operation of a vehicle causing death\". Under Section 328A of the Queensland Criminal Code, the maximum penalties, for this offence, are:\n\nDriving disqualifications handed down by Australian courts, whether inside or outside Queensland, will result in the suspension of Queensland driving privileges. Disqualifications for dangerous operation of a vehicle causing death are included.\n\nIn Canada, the Criminal Code has several road traffic offences equivalent to causing death by dangerous driving. The basic offence, \"\", has a maximum penalty of 14 years' imprisonment. If the driver is convicted of failing to stop for police, criminal negligence, street racing, a hit and run or drink-driving, in addition to dangerous driving, and a death resulted, the maximum penalty is life imprisonment. \nA person's Canada-wide driving privileges will be suspended, for any Criminal Code driving conviction, although lengths of suspensions vary by province and territory. In some cases, a driver's licence can be taken away permanently after a certain number of Criminal Code driving convictions, as in the province of Ontario.\n\nSome provinces and American states have agreements to mutually recognize road traffic offences that occur out-of-province or out-of-state. Traffic violations that occur in Michigan and New York for vehicular homicide are counted, for licence suspension purposes, on a person's Ontario driving record. Vehicular homicide convictions in Maine and New York are counted on a driver's Quebec driving record (see also \"United States\" above).\n\nAn equivalent, under Republic of Ireland traffic laws, to causing death by dangerous driving, is \"Dangerous driving causing death\". The maximum period of imprisonment, for such a conviction, is 10 years. The minimum licence suspension is 5 years. The UK and Republic of Ireland are parties to the 1998 EU Convention on Driving Disqualifications (98/C 216/01) and therefore convictions for dangerous driving causing death in the UK are counted on a person's Republic of Ireland driving record.\n\nIn many American states, vehicular homicide is an equivalent to causing death by dangerous driving. Maximum prison sentences and licence suspension lengths vary by state.\n\nVehicular homicide, under the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986, is often classified as a \"major violation\", with the following minimum CDL suspensions applicable country-wide:\n\nSome states, such as Florida and Virginia, count out-of-state traffic violations, so long as they occurred anywhere else in the United States, the same as traffic violations that occurred in the state in which the driver was licensed. Vehicular homicide convictions are included.\n\nOther states, such as New York and Maine, count some traffic violations that occur in Canada, the same as if those violations had occurred in those states. Vehicular homicide convictions are included. Permanent revocation of driving privileges is possible, particularly for holders of driving licences issued in North Carolina or New York, after a vehicular homicide conviction.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "601066", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=601066", "title": "City of Boerne v. Flores", "text": "City of Boerne v. Flores\n\nCity of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507 (1997), was a US Supreme Court case concerning the scope of Congress's enforcement power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. The case also had a significant impact on historic preservation.\n\nThe basis for dispute arose when the Catholic Archbishop of San Antonio, Patrick Flores, applied for a building permit to enlarge his 1923 mission-style St. Peter's Church in Boerne, Texas. The building was located in a historic district and considered a contributing property. Local zoning authorities denied the permit, citing an ordinance governing additions and new construction in a historic district. The Archbishop brought suit, challenging the ruling under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) of 1993. Flores argued that his congregation had outgrown the existing structure, rendering the ruling a substantial burden on the free exercise of religion without a compelling state interest.\n\nRFRA had been crafted as a direct response to the Supreme Court's decision in \"Employment Division v. Smith\", when the Court had upheld, against a First Amendment challenge, an Oregon law criminalizing peyote use, which was used in Native American religious rituals. The State of Oregon won on the basis that the drug laws were \"non-discriminatory laws of general applicability.\"\n\nReligious groups became concerned that this case would be cited as precedent for further regulation of common religious practices and lobbied Congress for legislative protection. RFRA provided a strict scrutiny standard, requiring narrowly tailored regulation serving a compelling government interest in any case substantially burdening the free exercise of religion, regardless of the intent and general applicability of the law.\n\nThe RFRA applies to all laws passed by Congress prior to its enactment and to all future laws that are not explicitly exempted.(42 U.S. Code § 2000bb–3) Congress' power to do so was not challenged. Congress also applied the law to state and local governments, the City of Boerne in this case, relying on the Fourteenth Amendment, particularly Section 5: \"The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.\"\n\nThe City of Boerne was successful at the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas; the judge struck down the RFRA as unconstitutional. Flores appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which found the RFRA constitutional and reversed the District Court's decision. Boerne filed a \"certiorari\" petition to the Supreme Court. The National Trust for Historic Preservation, among other preservation organizations, filed briefs in support of Boerne.\n\nThe Court, in an opinion by Justice Anthony Kennedy, struck down RFRA as it applies to the states as an unconstitutional use of Congress's enforcement powers. The Court held that it holds the sole power to define the substantive rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment—a definition to which Congress may not add and from which it may not subtract. Congress could not constitutionally enact RFRA because the law was not designed to have \"congruence and proportionality\" with the substantive rights that the Court had defined. Although Congress could enact \"remedial\" or \"prophylactic\" legislation to guarantee rights not exactly congruent with those defined by the Court, it could only do so in order to more effectively prevent, deter, or correct violations of those rights actually guaranteed by the Court. RFRA was seen disproportionate in its effects compared to its objective. Justice Kennedy wrote:\nMoreover, remedial or prophylactic legislation \"still\" had to show \"congruence and proportionality\" between the end it aimed to reach (that is, the violations it aimed to correct), and the means it chose to reach those ends—that is, the penalties or prohibitions it enacted to prevent or correct those violations. Because RFRA was not reasonably remedial or prophylactic, it was unconstitutional.\n\n\"Boerne\" is important for several reasons. One reason is that it introduced a completely new test for deciding whether Congress had exceeded its section-five powers: the \"congruence and proportionality\" test, a test that has proven to have great importance in the context of the Eleventh Amendment. Another reason was that it explicitly declared that the Court alone has the ability to state which rights are protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. Yet another was that it had First Amendment consequences too, in that it spelled the end for any legislative attempts to overturn \"Employment Division v. Smith\".\n\nThe \"congruence and proportionality\" requirement replaced the previous theory advanced in \"Katzenbach v. Morgan\" that the Equal Protection Clause is \"a positive grant of legislative power authorizing Congress to exercise its discretion in determining the need for and nature of legislation to secure Fourteenth Amendment guarantees.\" Before the 1997 \"Boerne\" decision, \"Katzenbach v. Morgan\" was often interpreted as allowing Congress to go beyond, but not fall short of, the Court's interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause.\nBut that is not how the majority opinion in \"Boerne\" interpreted \"Katzenbach\":\n\nThe holding of \"Boerne\" said that only the Court could interpret the Constitution, in order to maintain the \"traditional separation of powers between Congress and the Judiciary.\" Also, \"Boerne\" relied on arguments for protecting the rights that pertain to state governments based on \"enumerated powers.\" The intent of \"Boerne\" was to prevent \"a considerable congressional intrusion into the States' traditional prerogatives and general authority.\" The holding of \"Boerne\" specifically mentioned the state action doctrine of the \"Civil Rights Cases\" as a Court interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause that limits the \"remedial or preventive\" power of Congress.\n\nThis case has been used to claim that the federal RFRA is \"unconstitutional\". The constitutionality of one aspect of RFRA as applied to the federal government was confirmed on February 21, 2006, as the Supreme Court ruled against the government in \"Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal\", , which involved the use of an otherwise illegal substance in a religious ceremony, stating that the federal government must show a compelling state interest in restricting religious conduct.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision in \"City of Boerne\" made a significant impact on the states' abilities to enforce laws, including those pertaining to historic preservation. Under RFRA, an otherwise neutral state law—such as zoning, or historic preservation ordinances—needed to be scrutinized if its enforcement involved a religious group or individual. Therefore, by declaring extension of RFRA to apply against state laws unconstitutional, the ability of the states to establish and maintain historic preservation ordinances was made easier. However, in 2000, Congress enacted the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, in which it used the Spending Clause to require, for localities that receive federal funding, land use laws to accommodate religious freedom, essentially, as if RFRA had been ruled applicable to state law.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1753454", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1753454", "title": "Dividend imputation", "text": "Dividend imputation\n\nDividend imputation is a corporate tax system in which some or all of the tax paid by a company may be attributed, or imputed, to the shareholders by way of a tax credit to reduce the income tax payable on a distribution. In comparison to the classical system, it reduces or eliminates the tax disadvantages of distributing dividends to shareholders by only requiring them to pay the difference between the corporate rate and their marginal rate.\n\nAustralia, Malta and New Zealand have imputation systems. Chile, Canada, Korea and the United Kingdom have a partial imputation system. Germany had a dividend imputation system until 2000 and France until 2004. Other jurisdictions (Singapore, for example) achieve a similar result by not taxing dividends at all. The difference under this arrangement is that shareholders obtain a tax benefit even though the company may not have paid any tax at the corporate level, and it also benefits non-resident shareholders. The imputation system effectively taxes the company profit at the shareholders' average tax rates.\n\nThe objective of the dividend imputation system is to eliminate double taxation of company profits, once at the corporate level and again on distribution as dividend to shareholders. More specifically, it is intended to create a \"level playing field\" by taxing the same activity in the same way, irrespective of the business structure being used, namely a company or trust, sole trader or partnership.\n\nThe Australian tax system allows companies to determine the proportion of franking credits to attach to the dividends paid. A franking credit is a nominal unit of tax paid by companies using dividend imputation. Franking credits are passed on to shareholders along with dividends.\n\nAustralian-resident shareholders include in their assessable income the grossed-up dividend amount (being the total of the dividend payable plus the associated franking credits). The income tax payable by the shareholders is calculated, and the franking credits are applied to offset the tax payable. In Australia and New Zealand the end result is the elimination of double taxation of company profits.\n\nDividend imputation was introduced in 1987, one of a number of tax reforms by the Hawke–Keating Labor Government. Prior to that a company would pay company tax on its profits and if it then paid a dividend, that dividend was taxed again as income for the shareholder, i.e. a part owner of the company, a form of double taxation.\n\nIn 1997 the eligibility rules (below) were introduced by the Howard–Costello Liberal Government, with a $2,000 small shareholder exemption. In 1999 that exemption was raised to the present $5,000. In 2000, franking credits became fully refundable, not just reducing tax liability to zero. In 2002, preferential dividend streaming was banned. In 2003, New Zealand companies could elect to join the system for Australian tax they paid.\n\nSay, a company makes profit of $100 and pays company tax of $30 (at 2006 rates) and records the $30 in the franking account. The $30 is paid to the tax office.\n\nThe company now has $70 left to pay a dividend, either in the same year or later years. When it does so, it may attach a franking credit from its franking account, in proportion to the tax rate. So if it pays a $70 dividend it could attach $30 of franking credits. When the dividend is paid, the franking account is debited by $30.\n\nAn eligible shareholder receiving a franked dividend declares the cash amount plus the franking credit as income, and is credited with the franking credit against their final tax bill. The effect is as if the tax office reversed the company tax by giving back the $30 to the shareholder and had them treat the original $100 of profit as income, in the shareholder's hands, like the company was merely a conduit.\n\nThus company profits going to eligible shareholders are taxed just once. Profits are either retained by the company and taxed there at the corporate rate, or paid out later as dividends and instead they're taxed at the shareholder's rate.\n\nDividends may still be paid by a company when it has no franking credits (perhaps because it has been making tax losses), this is called an \"unfranked dividend\". Or it may pay a franked portion and an unfranked portion, known as \"partly franked\". An unfranked dividend (or the unfranked portion) is ordinary income in the hands of the shareholder.\n\nA franking credit on dividends received after 1 July 2000 are refundable tax credits. It is a form of tax paid, which can reduce a taxpayer's total tax liability, and any excess is refunded. For example, an individual with income below the tax-free threshold ($18,200 since 2011/12) pays no tax at all and can get the franking credits back in full, after a tax return is lodged.\n\nPrior to 1 July 2000 such excess franking credits were lost. For example, an individual at that time paying no tax would get nothing back, they merely kept the cash part of the dividend received.\n\nThe easiest way for an investor to value a franked dividend is to think of the franking credit as part of the income they receive. The investor doesn't get it in cash, only as a kind of IOU from the tax office, but nonetheless it and the cash portion make up pre-tax income. Thus a franked dividend of $0.70 plus $0.30 credit is exactly equivalent to an unfranked dividend of $1.00, or to bank interest of $1.00, or any other ordinary income of that amount. (It's exactly equivalent because franking is fully refundable, as described above.)\n\nFranked dividends are often described as a \"tax effective\" form of income. The basis for this is that the cash $0.70 looks like it's taxed at a lower rate than other income. For example, for an individual on the top rate of 48.5% (for 2006) the calculation is $0.70 plus $0.30 credit is $1.00 on which $0.485 tax is payable, but less the $0.30 credit makes $0.185 net tax, which is just 26.4% of the original $0.70. Conversely, an individual on the 20% marginal tax rate actually gets a $0.10 rebate. In this latter case, the rebate looks very much like negative tax.\n\nThere's nothing inherently wrong with the latter way of thinking about franked dividends, and it is frequently made to demonstrate how franking benefits the investor, but it can be argued a grossing-up like the former is better when comparing yields across different investment opportunities.\n\nThere are restrictions on who can use franking credits. Those who cannot must simply declare as income the cash dividend amount they receive. The restrictions are designed to prevent the trading of franking credits between different taxpayers. An eligible shareholder is one who either\n\n\nOr who\n\n\nThus franking credits are not available to short-term traders, only to longer term holders, but with small holders exempted provided it's for their own benefit.\n\nThe small shareholder exemption is not a \"first $5000\", but rather once the $5000 threshold is passed the rule is inoperative and all one's shares are under the holding period rule.\n\nFor the holding period rule, parcels of shares bought and sold at different times are reckoned on a \"first in, last out\" basis. Each sale is taken to be of the most recently purchased shares. This prevents a taxpayer buying just before a dividend, selling just after, and asserting it was older shares sold (to try to fulfill the holding period).\n\nThis \"first in, last out\" reckoning may be contrasted with capital gains tax. For capital gains the shareholder can nominate what parcel was sold from among those bought at different times.\n\nA dividend received by a company shareholder is income of the receiving company, but the dividend income is not grossed-up for the franking credit nor is the receiving company entitled to claim the franking credit as a tax credit. Instead, the franking credit is added directly to the receiving company's franking account, and can be paid out in the same way as franking credits generated by the receiving company.\n\nThis transfer of credits has made the previous \"intercorporate rebates\" allowances redundant. Those rebates had avoided double taxation on dividends paid from one company to another company. Those rebates were part of the original 1936 Taxation Act (section 46), meaning that the principle of eliminating double taxation has been present to some degree in Australian income tax law for a very long time.\n\nThe company tax rate has changed a few times since the introduction of dividend imputation. In each case transitional rules have been made to maintain the principle of reversing the original tax paid, even if the tax rate has changed. This has been either by separate franking accounts for separate rates (e.g. class A 39%, class B 33%), or making an adjusting recalculation of the credits (e.g. into class C 30%).\n\nNew Zealand companies can apply to join the Australian dividend imputation system (from 2003). Doing so allows them to attach Australian franking credits to their dividends, for Australian tax they have paid. Those credits can then be used by shareholders who are Australian taxpayers, the same as dividends from an Australian company.\n\nThere are certain anti-tax-avoidance rules to prevent New Zealand companies deliberately streaming Australian franking credits towards their Australian shareholders; credits must be distributed on a pro-rata basis.\n\nNote that it is only Australian franking credits which can be used by an Australian taxpayer. New Zealand imputation credits on dividends paid to an Australian shareholder cannot be used against that shareholder's Australian taxes.\n\nA company is not obliged to attach franking credits to its dividends. But it costs the company nothing to do so, and the credits will benefit eligible shareholders, so it is usual to attach the maximum available. It's actually possible for a company to attach more than it has, but doing so attracts tax penalties that mean this is not worthwhile.\n\nIn the past it was permissible for corporations to direct the flow of franking credits preferentially to one type of shareholder over another so that each may benefit the most as fits their tax circumstances. For example, foreign shareholders cannot use franking credits (they can't be offset against withholding tax) but Australian shareholders can. This practice, known as \"dividend streaming\", became illegal in 2002, whereafter all dividends within a given time frame must now be franked to a similar (but need not be identical) degree irrespective of shareholder location or which class of shares held.\n\nTo a large extent, dividend imputation makes company tax irrelevant. This is because every dollar that a company pays in company tax can be claimed by the shareholder as franking credit, with no net revenue flowing to the government. (There are exceptions which include profits retained by the company that are never paid as dividends, and payments to international investors.)\n\nWhen gross company tax is reported by Treasury, it is unclear whether the number generally includes the effect of the corresponding franking credits.\n\nOne effect is that this has reduced the effectiveness of tax incentives for corporations. If a corporation was given a tax break then its incomes thus released from taxation would not generate franking credits precisely because no tax was paid. In turn, this meant that the shareholders received fewer credits along with their dividends, meaning in turn that they had to pay more tax.\n\nThe net result is that each tax break a corporation itself got was countered by a matching increase in the tax burden of shareholders, leaving shareholders in exactly the same position had no tax break been received by the corporation. Thus, to the extent that corporate directors acted so as to increase shareholder wealth, tax incentives would not influence corporate behaviour.\n\nNew Zealand introduced a dividend imputation system in 1989. It operates on similar principles to the Australian system. A shareholder receiving a dividend from a company is entitled to an \"imputation credit\", which represents tax paid by the company, and is used to reduce or eliminate the shareholder's income tax liability.\n\nFrom 1973 to 1999, the UK operated an imputation system, with shareholders able to claim a tax credit reflecting advance corporation tax (ACT) paid by a company when a distribution was made. A company could set off ACT against the company's annual corporation tax liability, subject to limitations.\n\nIn 1999 ACT was abolished. Shareholders receiving a dividend were still entitled to a tax credit to offset their tax liability, but the tax credit no longer necessarily represented tax paid by the company, and could not be refunded to the shareholder. The tax credit was abolished as of 6 April 2016 and replaced with a tax-free dividend allowance of £5,000.\n\n\n"}

Bernard argues that interventions in Rwanda and Nigeria, which adapted American dispute prevention and resolution methods to African media and dispute resolution traditions, may provide a better fit and forum for the U.S. to address eliminationist media messages and their impact on society.\n\nTheodore N. Kaufman self-published \"Germany Must Perish!\" in the United States in 1941. In the 104-page book, Kaufman advocated genocide through forced sterilization of all Germans and the territorial disassociation of Germany. The obscure book received very little attention in the US, but was eventually cited by the Nazi regime as proof of a vast Jewish conspiracy to annihilate Germany and Germans (Kaufman was a Jew). The Nazis published quotes from the book in wartime propaganda, pretending that the book was indicative of the views of the Allied Powers, which in turn was added justification for Nazi Germany's continued persecution of the Jews as part of the Holocaust.\n\nDuring the 1991–2002 Algerian Civil War the predominant faction of the conflict's first phase was known as \"les éradicateurs\" for their ideology and for their rural and urban tactics.

{"id": "1864057", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1864057", "title": "Entitlement theory", "text": "Entitlement theory\n\nEntitlement theory is a theory of distributive justice and private property created by Robert Nozick in his book \"Anarchy, State, and Utopia\". The theory is Nozick's attempt to describe \"justice in holdings\" (Nozick 1974:150)—or what can be said about and done with the property people own when viewed from a principle of justice.\n\nNozick's entitlement theory comprises three main principles:\n\n\nNozick believes that if the world were wholly just, only the first two principles would be needed, as \"the following inductive definition would exhaustively cover the subject of justice in holdings\":\n\nThus, entitlement theory would imply \"a distribution is just if everyone is entitled to the holdings they possess under the distribution\" (Nozick 1974:151). However, not everyone follows these rules: \"some people steal from others, or defraud them, or enslave them, seizing their product and preventing them from living as they choose, or forcibly exclude others from competing in exchanges\" (Nozick 1974:152). Thus the third principle of rectification is needed.\n\nEntitlement theory is based on John Locke's ideas. Under entitlement theory, people are represented as ends in themselves and equals, as Kant claimed, though different people may own (i.e. be entitled to) different amounts of property. Nozick's ideas create a strong system of private property and a free-market economy. The only just transaction is a voluntary one. Taxation of the rich to support full robust social programs for the poor is unjust because the state is acquiring money by force instead of through a voluntary transaction. However, Nozick's ideas can endorse the creation of a minimal social program for the poor. Every person in the state of nature can achieve a certain level of welfare according to their own abilities. This level of welfare, while not equal, must be maintained via the Lockean proviso. Given the justice of acquisition condition and the Lockean proviso, \"It is conceivable that in the normal operation of the economy, a private property regime might at some times, for some people, fail to provide access to this level of welfare when left to itself. If so, then justice—as the libertarian understands it—demands that the state act to correct the distribution of welfare generated by the spontaneous play of market forces.\"\n\nEntitlement theory contrasts sharply with the Principles of Justice in Rawls' \"A Theory of Justice\", which states that each person has an equal claim to basic rights and liberties, and that inequality should only be permitted to the degree that such inequality is \"reasonably expected to be to everyone's advantage\" (Rawls 1999: 53). There is a further provision that such inequalities are only permissible insofar as there is an equality of opportunity to benefit from these inequalities. Nozick instead argues that people who have or produce certain things have rights over them: \"on an entitlement view, [production and distribution] are not ... separate questions ... things come into the world already attached to people having entitlements over them\" (Nozick 1974:160). Nozick believes that unjustly taking someone's holdings violates their rights. \"Holdings to which ... people are entitled may not be seized, even to provide equality of opportunity for others\" (Nozick 1974:235). Thus, a system which works to reduce the rightfully earned holdings of some so that they can be equally distributed to others is immoral.\n\nIn his later work, \"The Examined Life\", Nozick reflects that entitlement theory's defense of people's holdings may have some problems, in that it could eventually lead to the vast majority of resources being pooled in the hands of the extremely skilled, or, through gifts and inheritance, in the hands of the extremely skilled's friends and children. Nozick says\n\nFurthermore, the notion of taxation being inherently unjust, and market transactions being inherently just, depends on the notion that they actually are as involuntary or voluntary as they appear: in a nation that permits free emigration of its citizens, taxation is not entirely involuntary, while market transactions for necessary goods and services can hardly be said to be entirely voluntary, and if the wealthy, or organized labor, or those in control of de facto industry standards are able to exert undue influence on such a market, they frequently skew those transactions to favor their own interests.\n\n"}
{"id": "18935471", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18935471", "title": "Fair dealing", "text": "Fair dealing\n\nFair dealing is a limitation and exception to the exclusive right granted by copyright law to the author of a creative work. Fair dealing is found in many of the common law jurisdictions of the Commonwealth of Nations.\n\nFair dealing is an enumerated set of possible defences against an action for infringement of an exclusive right of copyright. Unlike the related United States doctrine of fair use, fair dealing cannot apply to any act which does not fall within one of these categories, although common law courts in some jurisdictions are less stringent than others in this regard. In practice, however, such courts might rule that actions with a commercial character, which might be naïvely assumed to fall into one of these categories, were in fact infringements of copyright, as fair dealing is not as flexible a concept as the American concept of fair use.\n\nIn Australia, the grounds for fair dealing are:\n\n\nRegarding fair dealing under Crown copyright the Australian \"Copyright Act\" 1968, ss.176-178. Section 182A (inserted by Act 154 of 1980, s.23) provides that the copyright, including any prerogative right or privilege of the Crown in the nature of copyright, in Acts, Ordinances, regulations etc., and judgments of Federal or State courts and certain other tribunals, is not infringed by the making, by reprographic reproduction, of one copy of the whole or part of that work for a particular purpose (this does not apply where charge for copy exceeds cost).\n\nRegarding the re-use of copyrighted images or drawings, the Australian \"Copyright Act\" does not impose a 10%-limit under its fair dealing provisions \"for the purpose of research and study\". Instead, each and every such use for research or study must be evaluated individually to determine whether it is fair, similar to the notion of fair use in U.S. copyright law. Among the criteria used to determine the fairness of a use are the purpose and character of the dealing, the nature of the work, the possibility of obtaining the work commercially within a reasonable time, the effect of the use on the potential market for the work or on its value, and how much of a work is copied.\n\nIn 2006, a federal law (\"Copyright Amendment Act\" 2006 (Cth) No. 158, 2006) enabled parody and satire to qualify as fair dealing under federal copyright law in certain circumstances.\n\nThe amendments in 2006 also added a number of other very specific and quite limited exceptions to copyright for personal use of AV material, including those popularly known as time shifting (s111) and format shifting (s110AA).\n\nSeveral government enquiries have recommended that Australia change to a Fair Use system - two of the recommendations were specifically in response to the stricter copyright rules introduced as part of the Australia–United States Free Trade Agreement (AUSFTA), while the most recent two, by the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) and the Productivity Commission (PC) were with reference to strengthening Australia's \"digital economy\".\n\nThe Canadian concept of fair dealing is similar to that in the UK and Australia. The fair dealing clauses of the Canadian \"Copyright Act\" allow users to engage in certain activities relating to research, private study, education, parody, satire, criticism, review, or news reporting. With respect to criticism, review, and news reporting, the user must mention the source of the material, along with the name of the author, performer, maker, or broadcaster for the dealing to be fair.\n\nPrior to 2011, fair dealing in Canada was not definitely found to contain exceptions for parody (unlike fair use in the United States), but the Copyright Act has since been amended to include parody and satire (along with educational use) under its fair dealing provisions. Previously, a Quebec Court of Appeal in \"Les productions Avanti Cine Video v. Favreau\" (4 Aug 1999) had recognized that parody could potentially be a 'critique', however it refused to recognize the exception in that circumstance.\n\nThe 2004 ruling by the Supreme Court of Canada in \"CCH Canadian Ltd. v. Law Society of Upper Canada\" has gone far in clarifying the concept of fair dealing in Canada. In considering fair dealing the Court makes the following general observation:\n\nIt is important to clarify some general considerations about exceptions to copyright infringement. Procedurally, a defendant is required to prove that his or her dealing with a work has been fair; however, the fair dealing exception is perhaps more properly understood as an integral part of the Copyright Act than simply a defence. Any act falling within the fair dealing exception will not be an infringement of copyright. The fair dealing exception, like other exceptions in the Copyright Act, is a user's right. In order to maintain the proper balance between the rights of a copyright owner and users' interests, it must not be interpreted restrictively.\n\nFurthermore, by taking \"a liberal approach to the enumerated purposes of the dealing\", the Court has made fair dealing more flexible, reducing the gap between this provision and US fair use\nIt then establishes six principal criteria for evaluating fair dealing.\n\nThough the Supreme Court outlined these six criteria, it noted that in some contexts, factors other than those listed may be relevant in determining whether a particular dealing is fair.\n\nOn June 2, 2010, the Government of Canada introduced Bill C-32, An Act to amend the Copyright Act. A summary of the changes proposed by this bill in terms of fair dealing notes that C-32 \"expands the scope of the fair dealing exception at section 29 of the Act to include new purposes: education, parody or satire\". The stated aims of the revised bill were also to \"permit businesses, educators and libraries to make greater use of copyright material in digital form\". Bill C-32 had not passed by the time the minority Conservative government faced a vote of no-confidence and subsequently fell on March 25, 2011.\n\nOn September 29, 2011, the bill was re-introduced to the Forty-first Parliament as Bill C-11. With the backing of a majority Conservative government, this version of the Copyright Modernization Act has passed into law. Simply put, the fair dealing amendment in Section 29 of Bill C-11 expands the first criteria for evaluating fair dealing - the Purpose of the Dealing - to include education, and parody or satire, in addition to research, private study, criticism and review.\n\nIn a press release on the Government of Canada's Balanced Copyright site, the Honourable James Moore, Minister of Canadian Heritage and Official Languages, notes that the revamped bill \"delivers a common-sense balance between the interests of consumers and the rights of the creative community\". Critics of the bill point to \"excessively restrictive digital lock amendments\" that they claim will create a situation where people \"are entitled to use copyrighted content lawfully but [are] prevented from doing so\".\n\nIn New Zealand, fair dealing includes some copying for private study, research, criticism, review, and news reporting. Sections 42 and 43 of the Copyright Act 1994 set out the types of copying that qualify. The criteria are perhaps most similar to those applying in the UK, although commercial research can still count as fair dealing in New Zealand. Incidental copying, while allowed, is not defined as \"fair dealing\" under the Act. As in Canada, fair dealing is not an infringement of copyright.\n\nThe factors determining whether copying for research or private study is judged to be fair dealing in New Zealand are its purpose, its effect on the potential market or value of the work copied, the nature of the work, the amount copied in relation to the whole work, and whether or not the work could have been obtained in a reasonable time at an ordinary commercial price.\n\nUnder the provisions for \"fair dealing\" in the Copyright Act, Chapter 63 of Singapore Statutes, a certain amount of copying for legitimate purposes, such as for the purpose of research or education, is permissible as long as it is a \"fair dealing\".\n\nIn deciding whether the use is a fair dealing, the following factors will be considered\n\nIn other cases, a fair dealing for the purpose of criticism or review; for the purpose reporting of news; for the purpose of judicial proceedings or professional advice would not constitute an infringement. In the case of criticism or review and the reporting of news, a sufficient acknowledgment of the work is required.\n\nThe reporting of the news could be by any means of communication to the public.\n\nIt is not an infringement if a person makes a copy from an original copy of a computer program which he or she owns for the purpose of using that duplicate copy as a back-up.\n\nA fair dealing with any work (except computer programmes) is allowed in India for the purposes of -\n\nThe term fair dealing has not been defined anywhere in the Copyright Act 1957. However, the concept of 'fair dealing' has been discussed in different judgments, including the decision of the Supreme Court of India in \"Academy of General Education v. B. Malini Mallya\" (2009) and the decision of the High Court of Kerala in \"Civic Chandran v. Ammini Amma\".\n\n\"Civic Chandran and Ors. v. C.Ammini Amma and Ors.\" is a 1996 Kerala High Court judgement that deals with the concept of fair dealing in India. In the case, a drama called \"Ningal Enne Communistakki\" was written by Thoppil Bhasi in Malayalam. It dealt with some of the burning social and political problems of those days, especially espoused by the then Communist Party of India to come to Power in Kerala during the assembly elections in 1957. The plaintiff brought a claim in this suit because the defendant, according to the plaintiff, had fabricated another drama called \"Ningal Aare Communistakki\", which was a counter drama to the drama written by Thoppil Bhasi and had been published in the 1995 annual issue of Ïndia Today\". It was alleged that the defendant had copied substantial portions of the original drama in his work and such reproduction was done without true creative intention and to take advantage of the creative talent and labour of Thoppil Bhasi. The defendant on the other hand, claimed that the counter drama is a new literary innovation 'where a play is counter-posed by using the very same theme and characters. The counter drama was written for the purpose to provide critical analysis of the original drama and to show how the ultimate purpose intended by Thoppil Bhasi has failed. Hence, copying of certain portions can only be treated as 'fair dealing'. The lower court ruled in the favor of the plaintiff and said, \"Copying down or extracting substantial portions of the drama, and using the same characters and dialogues of the drama with some comments here and there through two-three characters in the counter-drama cannot be treated as fair dealing for the purpose of criticism\". Thus, he was not provided any protection under section 52 of the Copyright Act.\n\nAn appeal was filed against this judgement in the Kerala High Court, where the Court looked at the case while referring to sections 14,51 and 52 of Copyright Act. Herein, the defendant claimed that since there was high probability of the defence of fair dealing being applicable in the case, irreparable injury that could have been caused, especially, looking at the current political scenario in Kerala, which would also show a lack of balance of convenience. If the counter-drama is not staged, there essence would be lost. Plaintiffs’ argued that the lower court’s decision should not be reversed unless the same is found to be completely illegal or perverse.\n\nThe Indian Copyright Act does not provide for a definition for 'fair dealing' but section 52(1)(a) and (b) specifically refers to fair dealing of the work and not the reproduction of the work. Hence, the court needs to take into account the following 3 aspects:\na) The quantum and value of the matter taken in relation to the comments or criticism;\nb) The purpose for which it was taken; and\nc) The likelihood of competition between the two works.\n\nAlong with the aforementioned aspects, the balancing aspect given in the case \"American Cyanamid v. Ethicon\" by Lord Diplock should be taken into account. As this suit was filed for granting interim injunction, the following also needs to be taken into account:\na) Establishment of a prima facie case;\nb) The balance of convenience;\nc) Irreparable injury likely to be caused in case the injunction is refused.\n\nSubsequently, the Court relied on the decision given in \"Hubbard v Vosper\", wherein Lord Denning had clarified that fair dealing is a question of degree. The number and extent of extracts and quotations and the use made of them need to be given due consideration. Also. there was also some reliance placed on \"R.G. Anand v. M/s Delux Films and Ors.\", wherein it was stated that the safest and the surest test to determine copyright infringement is to see if the spectator, after having seen both the works, gets an unmistakable impression that the subsequent work appears to be a copy of the original. \nAfter analysing every scene of the counter drama and the drama, the Court reached the conclusion that the scenes and characters were not borrowed from the original drama for the purpose of reproduction in a substantial manner. The real objective of the counter-drama was to criticize the ideology depicted in the drama and to show how the drama had been unsuccessful in achieving the targets it had purported to have aimed for. It also said that there was enough material in the counter-drama to show that the Defendant had used labour and skill of his own and the differences between the original drama and the counter-drama could not be considered inconsequential. The portions of the original drama which were copied in the counter-drama were taken only to make the criticism more effective. Thus, no prima facie case could be established against the defendant. Also, there is no competition between the drama and the counter-drama. Moreover, if the injunction is granted, it would cause irreparable injury to the Defendants as they had made all arrangements to stage the counter drama and a huge amount of money was spent in that.\n\nHence, the decision of the Additional District Judge was reversed and it was held that even if the copying was of substantial portions, the same could be excused as it constituted fair dealing, as it was also in public interest.\n\nIn South Africa, fair dealing is dealt with in the Copyright Act of 1978 (Act 98 of 1978, including subsequent amendments). Fair dealing itself is described in section 12(1) of the Act, whereas sections 13 to 19 explains various exceptions to copyright. Section 20 deals with the author's moral rights, which, if infringed, may also impact on a fair dealing ruling.\n\nAccording to this Act,\n\nCopyright shall not be infringed by any fair dealing with a literary or musical work\nProvided that, in the case of paragraphs (b) and (c)(i), the source shall be mentioned, as well as the name of the author if it appears on the work.\n\nSection 12 mentions both \"fair dealing\" and \"fair practice\", and it would seem that these two terms are equivalents. Musical works are compositions (i.e. manuscripts), not music recordings. The fair dealing exceptions do not apply to music recordings.\n\nUnder the \"Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988\" (CDPA), fair dealing is limited to the following purposes: research and private study (both must be non-commercial), criticism / review / quotation, and news reporting (sections 29, 30, 178); as well as parody, caricature and pastiche (section 30A) and illustration for teaching. Although not actually defined as a fair dealing, incidental inclusion of a copyrighted work in an artistic work, sound recording, film, broadcast or cable programme doesn't infringe copyright. Since 2014 the UK has protected the fair dealing exceptions from override by contracts or contractual terms and conditions.\n\nContrary to the often stated view, the provisions of section 29 of the CDPA do \"not\" state the amount of an in-copyright work that may be copied for the purposes of non-commercial research or private study or to single copies of the work, where the copies are made by the researcher or student himself. Such restrictions only apply to copies made by or on behalf of a librarian (by virtue of s. 40), or by a person, other than the researcher or student himself, who knows or has reason to believe that \"it will result in copies of substantially the same material being provided to more than one person at substantially the same time and for substantially the same purpose\" (by virtue of parag. s. 29(3)b).\n\nFor copying beyond the boundaries of fair dealing, universities and schools in the UK obtain licences from a national copyright collective, the UK Copyright Licensing Agency (CLA). Under these licences, multiple copies of portions of copyrighted works can be made for educational purposes.\n\nThe UK is the only Member State of the European Union that does not have a private copy exception, since the High Court has quashed the relevant regulations in \"British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (Basca) and Others v. Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills\". Consequently, now commonplace activities such as format shifting (saving one's music contained in their CDs on their MP3 players or on their smartphones) have become illegal.\n\nThe parallel concept in United States copyright law is fair use. The term \"fair dealing\" has a different meaning in the U.S. It is a duty of full disclosure imposed upon corporate officers, fiduciaries, and parties to contracts. In the reported cases, it usually arises in the context of the \"implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,\" which underlies the tort cause of action for insurance bad faith.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13807736", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13807736", "title": "History of Bolivian nationality", "text": "History of Bolivian nationality\n\nHistorically, a major issue for the Bolivian nationality movement has been citizenship for indigenous peoples. Over time, the rights for the indigenous peoples in Bolivia have increased, including giving political voice and property rights. Presently, the indigenous peoples are denied full citizenship.\n\nAn integral facet of the nationality movement in Bolivia concerns itself with the question of indigenous peoples. In part, the desire for independence from Spain stemmed from the growing mass of Indians and other indigenous groups within Bolivia who were in the process of reacquiring an identity that was not linked to Europe. While their subjugation and ostracization from the political arena is well catalogued, the fact remains that for a significant portion of Bolivia’s modern history natives were excluded from citizenship rights as well. The Spanish colony had shaped sociocultural diversity in its inception by establishing a dual-republic model: that of the Spaniards, which was dominant, and that of the Indians, “which paid the first its tribute and its labor.”\n\nFurthermore, the establishment of “regimes of social order” created categories of belonging and “otherness” that continue into the modern era. According to Deborah Yashar, author of \"Contesting Citizenship in Latin America: The Rise of Indigenous Movements and the Postliberal Challenge\", although indigenous peoples constitute a majority of the population in Bolivia, politicians are prone to use them as tools in the political process, essentially furthering their subjugated status. Conversely, however, the inclusion of native imagery is often utilized to create a sense of national identity, even though the indigenous peoples are excluded from participating in it. For example, urban elites tend to identify with indigenous imagery in order to distinguish themselves as Bolivian, although this serves as a contradiction, as they will vigorously attempt to draw distinctions between themselves and ‘real’ indigenous peoples. In fact, it is “through the interplay of racial discrimination and gender hierarchy that the national ideal is constructed and … that racialized class inequality is reproduced and reinforced.”\n\nHowever, this course is shifting, as regional movements in both Andean and Amazonian Bolivia emerge to defend the local autonomy of separate native groups. An example of the need to protect the local autonomy is witnessed in the rise of state intervention in the Amazon, where previously this autonomy had fared well without state presence. The end result of these movements was the forging and introduction of ethnic politics into the political debate. While these did not reshape the entire political process, issues that began to dominate the national discourse included territorial autonomy, legal pluralism, and land reform, among other indigenous concerns.\n\nThis in turn led to demanding equal positions in the nascent democracy created in the late twentieth century. However, there were three developments that impeded the rise of true indigenous autonomy in the political sphere. First of all, the success of “indigenous reforms” depended largely on the political will of the sitting Bolivian president. Second, political party competition was a significant obstacle, in that the various political parties already entrenched in the system would attempt to ensnare the indigenous movements, which had the effect of weakening the individual interest groups. By participating in electoral politics, the indigenous movement could be torn asunder, where factions and disagreements could be fomented over which party to support.\n\nFor most of the nineteenth century, when the question of citizenship began to rise to the fore, there existed in Bolivia two distinct entities, namely those with power and the indigenous groups. The desire of the native groups to be more than simply hard laborers began to cause a rift in Bolivian society; as early as 1826, a British vice-consular secretary noted that there were strong disintegrative forces at work within the republic, related to physical, cultural and regional diversity. There were many reasons for the discontent among the native Bolivians, as well as for the fear among the ruling elite. One example is that the major urban centers were situated in the midst of the Aymara and Quechua communities, which were two of the more influential indigenous groups.\n\nHowever, of the more incendiary problems, the territorial issue was the more prominent, as it was an area of contention for many Bolivians. In the early nineteenth century, the indigenous population of Bolivia was divided between a servile tenantry who lived on landed estates and those communal members who inhabited independent communities, called \"ayllus\". According to the first national census in 1846, over half the population lived on these communal landholdings; the significance in this is that peasant communities still held approximately half the land as well as half the population, whereas the servile tenantry was steadily declining. Seeing as how the indigenous population paid significant tributary taxes on all revenues, it became advantageous for the Bolivian republic to continue the system of official tributary and territorial identification as a basis of “Indianness,” rather than abolish the arrangement. The tributary system had been instituted as a result of economic collapse, Bolivia being an especially weakened and economically depressed country as the independence era drew to a close. Furthermore, there existed a serious social stratification among indigenous communities, reinforced by the early republic: at the top were situated those living in ayllus, followed by the servile tenantry, with peasant freeholders situated on the bottom.\n\nWhile all enjoyed a relatively institutionalized relationship with regards to the law and the governing bureaucracy, the main separation lay in the fact that the first two social castes held a vested interest in the tributary system, while the landless peasant did not. This led to a rapid decline in tributary populations, as these individuals would evade tax collectors and the official tax rolls. Therefore, to be perceived as Indian, or as truly indigenous, was not simply a legal and administrative tool, but rather a facet of everyday practices. In fact, indigenous tribes began to advocate for a “hybrid tributary-citizenship status,” which was firmly entrenched with land holdings; in other words, to hold land meant obtaining some variant of official citizenship.\n\nEventually, however, this limited ideal for inclusive citizenship coupled with various failed attempts at land reform was insufficient to satisfy the native groups who wished to partake more fully in a growing economy. The government attempted at various moments during the 1860s to introduce Indian land reforms, which were met with stiff opposition. The 1863 decree by President Jose Maria de Acha dealt with revisiting idealized forms of Indian land tenure. Acha advocated the subdivision of communal plots leading to a participation in a free market economy, where natives would buy and sell households at will, a practice that many believed would increase agricultural production and lead many Indians to becoming prosperous yeomen. However, the government also stipulated that the Indian must “civilize,” by which it was understood that new households must conform to certain accepted norms, such that they be “comfortable, spacious and ventilated houses,” or the construction of state approved educational facilities would need to be undertaken. The government faced stiff opposition from indigenous groups and the venture was dropped until the land reforms were forced upon the population by subsequent governments in 1866 and 1868. In adopting these land reforms, the government demonstrated its ignorance of Indian culture within its own borders: by hoping that the indigenous peoples would adapt easily and sell off vast tracts of land to the highest bidder, thereby putting wastelands into production and easily increasing state revenues, they failed to consider traditional practices of land rotation. More important to the Indians claims to citizenship, however, was the land reformers’ plan to strengthen the image of the Indian as peasant, whereby any claims to citizenship would be dictated and controlled by the state: socializing them to perform manual labor, to stay in the countryside, in all an attempt to civilize the Indians on the government’s terms.\n\nThis was not accepted quietly. The most active group in pursuing greater participation in acquiring citizenship rights was the Aymara, who would challenge the tributary system by day via official legal means, whereas at night they would embark upon guerrilla tactics to oppose the changes in land tenure being enforced by the government.\n\nThis law saw the culmination of a decade of struggle between the various native groups and the government. It set the basic terms for Indian landholding that would continue up to the mid-twentieth century. While the law conceded the right of individual landownership to Indians, it also abolished the community as a juridical entity. Rather, this radical law dismantled the tributary system that had existed for decades, replaced instead by a universal property tax. Unfortunately, Indians lost the modicum of power that they had held as ethnic mediators; henceforth, they would be juridical subjects of civil law, “directly subject to the authority of white and mestizo agents and to the siege of the land market.”\n\nAs South American states strengthened up to the mid-twentieth century, so too did the ideals attached to the notion of citizenship and belonging. Throughout, the hardness or flexibility of “ethnic hierarchies continued to be influenced through specific local power, socioeconomic, and demographic structures.” In regions where a dominant white had exercised excessive authority for many decades over a broad majority of subordinated ethnic groups, as in the case of Bolivia, ethnic hierarchies tended to remain more closed. However, the mid-twentieth century saw the emergence of indigenous intellectuals who desired to design, in the words of Jacobsen and de Losada, a “racial order for the nation capable of overcoming what they saw as the degenerate, corrupt, and chaotic Bolivian republic of the nineteenth century.”\n\nThe change in attitudes and the desire to obtain an improved version of citizenship for indigenous groups began in the early stages of the twentieth century. At this point in time, Bolivian intellectuals began to distance themselves from racial theories that had long been imported from old Europe, and began to examine their own multicultural heritage. One of the proposed methods to accomplish this was to propose new reforms that would genuinely benefit the Indian races within Bolivia, in the hopes that the entire state could benefit. One theory that emerged was the cultural nationalism of Franz Tamayo. Although taking a superior stance, he advocated the introduction of “educator-civilizers,” who would help uplift the indigenous peoples from their lack of citizenship rights; however, the Indian would have to earn his place within the nation-state through “productive labor, patriotic service, and civic virtues.” In other words, Tamayo envisioned a social compact between the state and indigenous tribes, wherein citizenship was provided in exchange for the conversion of the Indian into something resembling the ruling classes.\n\nHowever, although the clean-cut version of creating a common citizenship and nationality seemed easy to accomplish, the reality remained that nation building is a complex undertaking. This is especially true when the object of nationalization is located the margins or even outside the boundaries of national belonging, owing to cultural practices and issues of race, class and gender. By the end of the first decade of the twentieth century, it became obvious that the indigenous populations were not becoming consumed by the assimilationist attempt. The problem, as in the nineteenth century, was a question of Indian land ownership. Intensifying agrarian battles led to a growing amount of litigation and political campaigning by indigenous authorities, which had the effect of generating a type of official acknowledgement of their status and citizenship within Bolivia. In a sense, the native groups used the weapons of the state to fashion a sense of belonging that rendered official their claims to citizenship rights. This led in turn to the growing movement of local and ethnic authorities mounting their own political discourses from below the mainstream political ideologies, from which they began to contest the political discourses and practices currently in place. This emerging national network began to demand rights to land, to education, and to full citizenship. However, it would take several decades before any real headway could be made, but the groundwork had been laid.\n\nFor a brief moment, there seemed to be hope for the indigenous political movement. In 1953, a party known as the \"Movimiento Nacionalist Revolucionaria\" (MNR, Nationalist Revolutionary Movement) had led a national revolution coupled with an agrarian reform; this in turn was succeeded by over three decades of military rule, where a Peasant-Military treaty was signed. The Aymara population collaborated closely with these regimes, in large part by stifling subversive attitudes. Their reward for their loyalty was universal suffrage, as well as the ability to impose their own style of local government in extensive agricultural areas.\n\nHowever, indigenous tribes still emerged in the 1980s with the desire to eradicate the exploitation and oppression of the Aymara and other indigenous peoples that had not been addressed by any government since the early twentieth century. By and large, the Aymara were elected by popular acclaim to lead indigenous groups to larger citizenship; the Aymara, for their part, renewed their support for the MNR. By the 1990s, the MNR saw resurgence in popularity, their candidate winning the presidential election in 1993. Upon his victory, he stated that “marginalization, inequality, and discrimination will be diminished in Bolivia, so as to yield to the building of a multicultural, multiethnic and plurinational country.” The future for indigenous peoples seemed bright indeed. Unfortunately, although the native movement was allied with the winning party, their inherent political weakness prevented them from enjoying full advantage of its access to the government.\n\nWith enthusiasm and expectations concerning their acceptance into full citizenship running so high, there was bound to be disappointment. With the first consecutive elected governments for decades, the first governments in Bolivia were more occupied with facing the challenge of mounting debts and weak economies than rectify the citizenship status of indigenous peoples, even if these same peoples had lent the party enough clout to ascend to governance. In fact, for most of the nineties, each successive government faced a different national crisis that required full attention. For the most part, although the future is brighter than it was in the nineteenth century, as indigenous peoples now have political voice as well as property rights, native peoples in Bolivia continue to be frustrated and exempt from full citizenship status.\n"}

The Supreme Court ruled that the INEC can not disqualify candidates, so Abubakar's name was added to ballots at the last minute.\n\nOn the subject of election irregularities, INEC spokesman Philip Umeadi said on April 19 that \"We are not sitting on any crisis in Nigeria.\".\nThe mission of INEC is to serve as an independent and effective EMB committed to the conduct of free, fair and credible elections for sustainable democracy in Nigeria. The vision of INEC is to be one of the best Election Management Bodies (EMB) in the world that meets the aspirations of the Nigerian people.\n\nThe origin of the INEC goes back to the period before Independence when the Electoral Commission of Nigeria was established to conduct 1959 elections. The Federal Electoral Commission (FEDECO), established in 1960 conducted the immediate post-independence federal and regional elections of 1964 and 1965. The electoral body was dissolved after the military coup of 1966. In 1978, the Federal Electoral Commission was constituted by the regime of General Olusegun Obasanjo, organizing the elections of 1979 which ushered in the Nigerian Second Republic under the leadership of Alhaji Shehu Shagari. It also conducted the general elections of 1983.\n\nIn December 1995, the military government of General Sani Abacha established the National Electoral Commission of Nigeria which conducted another set of elections. These elected institutions were not inaugurated before the sudden death of General Abacha on June 1998 aborted the process. In 1998 General Abdulsalam Abubakar's Administration dissolved NECON and established the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). INEC organized the transitional elections that ushered in the Nigerian Fourth Republic on May 29, 1999.\n\nIn January 2015, the \"#BringBackOurGirls group has raised the alarm over plans by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to exclude Chibok and some communities currently under the control of the Boko Haram from getting the permanent voter cards (PVCs) for the February elections.\"\n\nThe chairmen of the first Nigerian Federal Electoral Commission was Chief Eyo Esua (1964–1966) in the First Republic. When General Olusegun Obasanjo prepared for a return to civilian power in the Second Republic, he established a new Federal Electoral Commission headed by Chief Michael Ani to supervise the 1979 elections. Ani was succeeded by Justice Victor Ovie Whisky.\nDuring the Ibrahim Babangida and Sani Abacha regimes, which attempted returns to democracy, the National Electoral Commission of Nigeria was headed by Professor Eme Awa (1987–1989), Professor Humphrey Nwosu (1989–1993), Professor Okon Uya and Chief Sumner Dagogo-Jack (1994–1998).\n\nGeneral Abdulsalami Abubakar established the current INEC, with Justice Ephraim Akpata as chairman.\nAkpata had to deal with 26 political associations, giving only nine provisional registration as political parties for the 1998/1999 elections, eventually whittled down to three parties.\nDespite efforts to ensure free and fair elections, the process drew serious criticism from international observers.\nAfter Akpata died in January 2000, the government of President Olusegun Obasanjo appointed Abel Guobadia Nigeria's Chief Electoral Officer, a position that was confirmed by the Nigerian Senate in May 2000.\nGuobadia was responsible for the 2003 elections, which were marred by widespread violence and other irregularities.\n\nIn June 2005, Guobadia retired and was succeeded by Professor Maurice Iwu. Soon after being appointed, Iwu announced that foreign monitors would not be allowed during elections, but only foreign election observers. This decision was condemned by politicians and civil society groups who called for his immediate removal from office.\nThe conduct of the 2007 elections was again criticized as falling below acceptable democratic standards.\n\nOn 8 June, 2010, Professor Attahiru Muhammadu Jega was nominated by President Goodluck Jonathan as the new INEC Chairman, subject to Senate confirmation, as a replacement for Iwu, who had vacated the post on 28 April 2010. Jega's nomination as INEC chairman followed approval by a meeting of the National Council of State called by President Jonathan and attended by former heads of state Yakubu Gowon, Muhammadu Buhari, Ibrahim Babangida, Abdulsalami Abubakar, Ernest Shonekan, Olusegun Obasanjo and Shehu Shagari.\nThe Senate President David Mark, Speaker of the House of Representatives Oladimeji Bankole, and most of the state Governors also attended the meeting.\nUnanimous approval by the council of the nominee for this critical appointment avoided controversy about whether or not the President should appoint the chairman of the INEC.\nReactions to the announcement from a broad spectrum of political leaders and organisations were positive, although some voiced concern that it could be too late to implement real reforms before the 2011 elections.\n\nDuring the campaigning for the 2015 Nigerian general election, Attahiru Jega \"faced fierce criticism from both the opposition and the ruling party.\"\nAttahiru Jega's five-year term came to an end on June 30, 2015, and though he was qualified for re-appointment, the chances of such became remote given the allegations of bias against him by campaign officials of President Goodluck.\n\n"}

The “marry-your-rapist” law is a legal way for such a rapist to avoid punishment and prosecution. Although the terms for this phenomenon were only coined in the 2010s, the practice has existed in a number of legal systems in history, and continues to exist in some societies today in various forms. Such laws were common around the world until the 1970s. Since the late 20th century, the remaining laws of this type have been increasingly challenged and repealed in a number of countries. \nProponents of rape-marriage laws argue that they shield the survivor and her family from the shame of rape. As a result, many women do not report their sexual assault because they fear this shame, and the possibility of being murdered by a fellow family member. If a woman simply marries her rapist, she preserves her family name and avoids a life of sexual shame. In a study conducted in Taiwan in August 2000, 35 rape survivors were interviewed to analyze the trauma that was undergone by these women, as well as any sexual shame or anxiety they may have felt as a result of their assault. The results of this study show that these women feared being vocal about their assault, felt guilty for shaming their families, experienced sexual shame and self blame, and developed negative views of themselves as women. Those who are against rape-marriage laws do not think victims should be left feeling this way after they have suffered an attack, or feel the need to cover up the assault by marrying the perpetrator. Opponents claim the laws promote impunity for rape, and further victimize rape survivors. Thus, the \"social\" value of women, as proponents assign to family honour, female chastity and marital status, clashes with opponents' claim of women's right to \"individual\" happiness, freedom and sexual autonomy. According to Purna Sen, the policy director for UN Women, these laws were passed to normalise the unlawful sexual activities. They make the sexual relations more respectable in the society because it is considered problematic in a few cultures. Countries who have these laws fall under the category of undeveloped countries and conservative countries.\n\nTraditionally, the marriage of the perpetrator and the victim after the rape was often seen as an appropriate 'resolution' of the situation. Among ancient cultures virginity was highly prized, and a woman who had been raped had little chance of marrying. These laws forced the rapist to provide for their victim. One such provision can be found in the Biblical Book of Deuteronomy 22:28-29 (written around the 7th century BCE), wherein sexual intercourse between a man and an unbetrothed virgin woman outside the city is considered wrongful. Irrespective of whether or not the woman had given consent to the sexual act, or will give consent to marriage, the man is given the option of marrying her by paying her parents a dowry to settle the matter.\n\nIn medieval Europe, for example, a man could 'rape' a woman, after which she could choose or be pressured to marry her attacker, because she was considered to be a damaged commodity, diminishing her marital prospects. In this specific context, however, the term 'rape' could also refer to elopement: a woman would give her consent to being abducted by the man she loved, and thus avoid asking permission from her parents to marry him.\n\nCiting Biblical injunctions (particularly Exodus 22:16–17 and Deuteronomy 22:25–30), Calvinist Geneva (1536–1564) permitted a single woman's father to consent to her marriage to her rapist, after which the husband would have no right to divorce; the woman had no explicitly stated separate right to refuse. The only consequence that the rapist faced was to pay a fine to the father of the woman that he raped. According to the Johannah Stiebert, women that were not engaged were not able to consent, so rape became a matter of male superiority.\n\nIn several Middle Eastern and North African countries, marry-the-rapist laws that were adopted upon achieving independence in the mid-20th century, were carried over from various earlier periods. The origins of these laws are to be traced to a mixture of pre-existing local Arab traditions, Ottoman imperial laws and European (French and British) colonial laws. These practices were also seen in Asian countries, such as India. Traditionally, a woman was considered to be the property of her father. If she was raped, she was considered damaged property “so the rapist must either pay ‘compensation’ or accept the damaged goods” and marry the victim. To avoid paying the family, the perpetrator often chose to marry the victim, who “had absolutely no choice but to marry the rapist and spend the rest of the life” with them. In this way, some might argue that the victim of the assault had a harsher punishment than their attacker. Now, looking at India’s Penal Code, the legislation “makes it amply clear that marriage does not act as an absolving factor in case of rape”.\n\nMarry-your-rapist laws were common around the world until the 1970s. Since the late 20th century, the remaining laws of this type have been increasingly challenged and repealed in a number of countries.\n\nBy 1997, 15 Latin American countries had laws that exonerated a rapist if he offered to marry the victim and she accepted. These countries were Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru (since 1924), Paraguay, the Dominican Republic, Uruguay and Venezuela. Costa Rica exonerated a rapist if he expresses an intention to marry the victim, even if she did not accept. The law in Peru was modified in 1991 to absolve all co-defendants in a gang rape case if any one of them married the victim. By 2017, all but four of these countries have definitively repealed these laws. Colombia repealed the law in 1997, Peru and Chile in 1999, Brazil and Uruguay in 2005, Nicaragua and Guatemala in 2006, Costa Rica in 2007, Panama in 2008, Argentina in 2012, Ecuador in 2014. Italy had similar laws until 1981.\n\nIn 2017, a World Bank Group report claimed there were 12 countries left with marry-your-rapist laws: Angola, Bahrain, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Palestine, the Philippines, Syria, and Tunisia. By July 2017, marry-your-rapist laws still existed – but were being challenged – in Algeria, Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, the Philippines, Syria and Tajikistan, amongst others, according to various media.\n\nThe practice of forcing victims of rape to marry their rapists continues even in many countries where the laws allowing this have been abolished, or never explicitly existed to begin with. This is the case, for example, in Ethiopia, where marriage by abduction remains common, despite it being illegal under the new 2004 Criminal Code. In Afghanistan, while formally there is no law, \"in practice it is not uncommon for a prosecution to be dropped if marriage is offered by the perpetrator or his family.\" Similar to Afghanistan, Somaliland also did not previously have any laws; however, it still wasn’t uncommon for a rape victim’s family to pressure them into marrying the perpetrator.\n\nSeveral human rights organisations such as Human Rights Watch, and the United Nations Human Rights High Commission have strongly criticised \"marry your rapist laws\" in other parts of the world. These organisations have been working towards abolishing this kind of laws, and in several cases they have been successful. However, the opposition to the “marry-your-rapist” laws has been less significant than the other demands made by women’s groups to criminalize marital rape altogether.\n\nArticle 353 of the Bahrain Penal Code, dating from 1958, has undergone several amendments since its adoption. It states that if a perpetrator marries the victim before the final sentencing is pronounced, the charges will be dropped and criminal proceedings will be suspended. The law has been under hard criticism from the international community in the early 21st century. Parliament voted to abolish it on 31 May 2016, and the Bahraini government started the discussions of abolishing or reforming Article 353, and reached a final decision to repeal the article. However, the government was still examining the law by December 2016. As of July 2017, the government was only willing to repeal the marriage option in case of a gang rape.\n\nIn 1999, Article 291 of the Egypt Penal Code was repealed by former president Hosni Mubarak by a presidential decree. The original article had been adopted in 1904 and inspired by a French provision. The original article allowed any individual who committed sexual assault to avoid penalty if he entered into marriage with the female victim. “In the Egyptian parliamentary debate surrounding the decree to remove the ‘‘marriage loophole,’’ some lawmakers have objected to altering the existing law on the grounds that it provided raped women with their only chance to marry, since after having been raped, no other man would want them (‘‘Egypt’s president voids law setting free rapists who marry victim,’’ Associated Press, 5 April 1999, n.p.). Rape law has, in statute and in practice, privileged the protection of social order over the provision of individual criminal justice.”\n\n“In 1996 the Assembly of El Salvador repealed an old law that exonerated a rapist if he offered to marry the victim and she accepted.” However, many rapists still had the ability to get away with rape by marrying the victim according to a law made in 1994 known as Article 14, which stated that as a general rule, persons under eighteen years of age can not marry, but established in the second paragraph, that exceptionally they can contract marriage if they are pubescent, they already have a child in common, or if the woman is pregnant. This law was abolished in 2017.\n\nArticle 427 of Iraq's penal code, in its current form dating from 1969, states that if the perpetrator lawfully marries the victim, any legal action becomes void. Following parliamentary votes in favour of the abolition of similar laws in Lebanon, Jordan and Tunisia in 2017, women's rights activists made efforts to put the issue on the political agenda during the campaign for the Iraqi parliamentary election, 2018.\n\nArticle 544 of the Italian Criminal Code considered rape an offence against 'public morality', not against an individual person. If the perpetrator married his victim, even if she was a minor, any sexual offence would lapse. Neither the law nor society made a distinction between such premarital rape on the one hand, and consensual elopement (in Sicily commonly called \"fuitina\") on the other. Socially, the victim was put under heavy pressure to agree to marrying her rapist; the alternative was being shunned for the rest of her life as \"una donna svergognata\": a \"woman without honour\" (literally: a shameless woman). The victim was held responsible for the humilation of losing her virginity out of wedlock, bringing shame upon herself and her family. If she agreed to marry her attacker, it was thus considered a \"reparational marriage\" (\"matrimonio riparatore\"), that restored her family's honour.\n\nIn 1966, Franca Viola was one of the first women to refuse a \"reparational marriage\" publicly. Franca Viola was only 17 years old when she was raped with the intention of marriage in 1965. The aftermath of her trial ruled that rapists were no longer able to avoid punishment through the marriage of their victims. In 1981, Italy eventually repealed Article 544.\n\nArticle 308 in the Jordanian Penal Code was voted to be abolished by Parliament on 1 August 2017. The article allowed for an aggressor of sexual assault to avoid persecution and punishment if he married the victim. The article was amended in 2016, barring full pardon in cases of rape but keeping a loophole clause that pardoned perpetrators if they married the victim if she is aged between 15 and 18 and if the assault was regarded as “consensual.” Early in 2017, the 10-person Royal Committee for Developing the Judiciary and Enhancing the Rule of Law presented King Abdullah a report recommending the closing of the loophole. The article was abolished in a \"historic vote\" by the House of Representatives of the Parliament on 1 August 2017. Article 308 of the Jordanian reformatory code implies that a rapist can escape punishment on the off chance that he consents to wed his victim. Only if the marriage lasts under three years does he need to serve his time. Through 2010 and 2013, a sum of 159 attackers strolled free along the lines of their punishment. Due to family and social pressures the rape victim chooses to settle the matter by marrying the rapist. “The law has permitted such a resolution out of recognition of the cultural value placed upon female virginity at marriage; despoiled girls and women are a source of shame for their families, innocent of wrongdoing though they may be.” Even though settling the case by marrying the rapist is viewed as a practical solution, the attackers frequently separate from their spouses/casualties not long after in the wake of wedding to stay away from criminal accusations.“The marriage loophole was created and used for the purpose of providing social problem solving rather than criminal justice, and it addressed the social practices surrounding raped women and family honour, rather than the crimes against individual women. The problem of the social existence of a raped woman is settled by having the rape victim disappear, to be replaced by a wife.” Marital rape that takes place behind closed doors remains legal in Jordan.\n\nTo resolve these issues there is an Islamic charity called “the Chastity Society” (Al-‘Af¯af). The director of the society, Dr. Mufid Sarhan explained that “falling marriage rates were socially disruptive and threatened to draw youths into illegitimate sexual relations, and he blamed the situation on a combination of government mismanagement and backward societal expectations that put marriage out of reach for many. To mitigate the disruptive potential of the crisis, the Chastity Society organized an annual mass wedding as a more efficient and cost-effective alternative to traditional weddings and worked with the Jordan Islamic Bank to dispense millions of dinar in interest-free loans to young couples. Led by President Abdul-Latif Arabiyyat (former head of the Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood’s political wing, the Islamic Action Front), the society presented itself as an alternative to the family and the state, which were rendered deficient in its view because of their inability to properly channel the sexual relationships of Jordanian youth. Through its knowledge production and broader activism, the Chastity Society used the state’s Sharia Court data as evidence of the state’s failure to legitimate the marriages of its citizens—and, hence, as evidence of the moral inadequacy of the state itself.” \n\nArticle 522 of the Lebanon Penal Code became a part of the law in the 1940s and stated that rape was a punishable offense, where the attacker could receive up to seven years in prison. However, no criminal prosecution would take place if the perpetrator and their victim got married, and stayed married for a minimum of three years. In 2017, Article 522 of the Lebanon Penal Code, which had been labelled a \"rape law\" was repealed and Articles 505 and 518 are to be reexamined. After Article 522 was repealed, it was argued by many that the law still lived on through Articles 505 and 518. Article 505 involves the act of sex with a minor, while Article 518 deals with the seduction of a minor accompanied by the promise of marriage.\n\nMalaysia does not have a rape-marriage law, but nearly did by judicial ruling in 2015–16. The Sessions Court verdict that a man accused of two counts of statutory rape of a 14-year-old girl from Petra Jaya in the Malaysian part of Borneo in October 2015, would escape punishment because he claimed to have married his victim, was overruled by the High Court in Sabah and Sarawak in August 2016 after large-scale protests argued this would set a dangerous precedent for child rapists to escape punishment. Because Malaysia does not have a law against marital rape, it is not uncommon for a rapist to marry their victim after an attack, then claim that the assault happened after they were married. Perpetrators can indeed be punished for acts of sexual violence if they are not married to their victim, but the absence of a law against marital rape provides a loophole, allowing rapists to marry their victims to avoid punishment.\n\nIn 2012, Morocco amended Article 475, which provided between one- to five-year prison sentence for a perpetrator that abducted or deceived a minor with no resort to violence or threat, or attempted to do so. The Article included a second clause that permitted the withdrawal of a persecution if the perpetrator married the girl or woman. A number of protests and campaigns took place in Morocco prior to the abolition of the Article. The Parliament abolished the law in 2014 as it was considered to be at odds with the 2011 constitution.\n\nSince being annexed by Egypt in 1959, the Gaza Strip has applied Egyptian penal law Articles 290 and 291, although these have been repealed in Egypt itself in 1999. After being annexed by Jordan in 1950, the West Bank has applied the 1960 Jordanian penal law Article 308. It is unclear how often the law was applied in practice. Ikhlas Sufan, director of a Nablus victims of violence shelter, told Human Rights Watch that \"between 2011 and 2017 prosecution for rape has been halted in 60 cases – in which the shelter was helping the women – after the alleged rapist agreed to marry the victim. In 15 of these cases the women later divorced these men.\" After an activist campaign put pressure on the Palestinian Authority, president Mahmoud Abbas eventually signed Law no. 5 of 2018 on 14 March 2018, which repealed article 308 of the 1960 Penal Code enforced in the West Bank. However, because the Gaza Strip is de facto controlled by Hamas, the Egyptian-derived marry-your-rapist law still applies there.\n\nAfter gaining independence in 1821, the first draft of the Peruvian penal code included a section specifically focused on the violence against women. This section encompassed a certain legal code that was meant to protect the “virginity” of women. It was not until 1924 when legislation was passed which stated that rapists were legally able to be exempt from sexual assault charges through a loophole. In cases of rape and to serve as a punishment for the perpetrator, the victim was required to enter into a marriage with their rapist. The notion that marriage could possibly restore a raped woman’s honor has been linked to the countries historical, patriarchal, and gender norms. In 1991, this law was modified to absolve co-conspirators in a gang rape case if one of them marries the victim. These laws were enacted upon the belief that it would protect the honor of both the victim and their family.\n\nAccording to cultural beliefs, instead of losing her virginity because of immoral behavior, a woman -or her father- retains the ability to claim that the act had taken place due to coercion, thereby saving the victims personal virtue. Marriage, in turn, would solve the problem of a lost virginity and possible illegitimate child, thus returning honor to the family. Peruvian government started to design and implement policies against domestic violence in 1988 after research showed them to have one of the highest rates of domestic violence against women ranking them 16th in the world. Per research, statistics from several Peruvian institutions, including emergency centers, police reports, and the Ministry for Women and Social Development, approximately 68,818 reports of sexual assaults were received during a ten-year span, which averages to an estimate of 18.8 cases that are reported per day.\n\nOn April 3, 1997, The Peruvian Congress voted to repeal the 1924 law that allowed rapists to be exonerated from sexual assault charges if they married their victims. The bill was passed by a vote of 86 to 1. According to congresswoman Beatriz Merino, who sponsored the bill, “This is a great victory for Peruvian women, and also for Peruvian men, since all of us together can celebrate the end of this embarrassment”.\n\nSomali law draws its inspiration from civil law, Islamic law and xeer. As of 2018, most cases of rape and sexual assault in Somalia are still settled through xeer, which is the country's native traditional \"cast-based dispute resolution system in which traditional male elders dispense justice according to customary laws.\" Following the customs of xeer, it is common for a 'diya' (a fine of money, camels or goats) to be paid by the rapist's family to the rape survivor's family, but in extreme scenarios, the victim is forced to marry her rapist.\n\nSince January 1991, Somalia has been in a state of civil war, without a functioning central government that controls the entire country. The northwestern region of Somaliland unilaterally declared independence in May 1991, while the northeastern region of Puntland unilaterally declared its regional autonomy within Somalia in 1998; both gradually evolved their own legal systems, and made efforts to outlaw the practice of forcing a rape victim to marry her attacker in the late 2010s.\n\nThe self-declared autonomous region of Puntland adopted a Sexual Offences Act in 2017, that criminalised all forms of sexual violence against women.\n\nThe unrecognised state of Somaliland, which declared its independence in 1991 but is internationally still considered part of Somalia, did not have any law explicitly allowing rapists to marry their victims in order to go free. However, since the practice is in fact occurring, which a number of politicians have found undesirable, efforts have been undertaken to formally ban it. In January 2018, the government “introduced a bill to outlaw rape and other violent sexual crimes for the first time in its history, which would see rapists imprisoned for up to 30 years”. The bill was approved by the lower house of Parliament. The president of Somaliland, Musa Bihi Adbi, hoped that this law will help to eliminate violence against women throughout the country.\n\nSyria’s family and criminal law are based on Sharia and as a result women and men are treated unequally under many of the current laws in place. This can be seen in the laws concerning rape as rapists can escape punishment if the victim agrees to marriage as stated in Article 508 of the penal code, \"If there is a contracted marriage between the man who commits rape, sexual abuse, kidnapping, sexual harassment and the victim, then there is no charge or the punishment is stopped”. This law is particularly harmful because many victims are pressured into marrying their rapist due to societal pressures. Unlike some other countries, rapists cannot marry victims that are too young to get married, even in cases of pregnancy and, in fact, receive an extended prison sentence.\n\nIn July 2017, Tunisia repealed Article 227 of its Criminal Code which provided a rapist the exemption to avoid all investigations or legal consequences if he married his victim. This repeal of the “marry-your-rapist” law was part of a much larger law in Tunisia to outlaw all violence against women. In a 2010 study by the National Office of Family and Population, 47% of Tunisian women reported being victims of violence. In an event that occurred in 2016, a young man raped his 13-year-old step-sister and married her after she became pregnant. An alleged rapist was able to end his prosecution if he married his victim. The court ruled that this was allowed under Article 277, which has since been removed. The backlash that was received after this ruling contributed to the repeal of the Article in 2017. The new law encompasses all forms of violence or discrimination against women, such as psychological abuse or economic discrimination, and is thus a breakthroughs for women’s rights in Tunisia. The same law criminalizes marital rape, classifying it as a crime in its own right, and has been commended for its preventative measures to the issue of violence.\n\nBackground\n\nUnder the Ben Ali regime, women's rights were not given much importance. Women made up only 20% of Tunisia’s work force, and they were constrained to low-paying, insecure jobs. Rural Tunisian women also faced deprivation and hardship. Freedoms of expression and association were limited. Heavy restrictions on registration to work for women’s organizations and political parties were in place. The overwhelming participation of women during the Tunisian revolution in 2011 made way for transformative changes in Tunisian politics in regards to gender. Tunisia has since been a symbol of advancement of women’s rights in the Arab world, being one of the first countries to establish women’s voting rights, right to abortion, right to divorce and outlawing polygamy. At the outset of the revolution, women were as active as men in demanding equal access to jobs, education and basic rights and freedoms. Women were heavily involved in the drafting of the new constitution after the revolution, which guarantees equality based on gender in at least one area. Article 21 of the constitution states that \"All male and female citizens have the same rights and duties. They are equal before the law without discrimination.\" Candidate quotas were introduced in Article 16, which guaranteed equal representation of women in politics. Considering the importance given to women’s rights, many considered the repeal of the “marry-your-rapist” law a matter of time. When Article 277 was repealed, Bochra Belhaj, a parliament member, passed out celebratory jasmine blossoms.\n\nArticle 116 of the Penal Code and Articles 22 and 23 of the executive order nº 15.032 of Uruguay were repealed in 2006. The articles stated that in crimes of sexual assault, statutory rape, abduction, and disrespect of modesty, the penalty would be extinguished in cases where the assailant and the victim made a matrimonial contract.\n\nA certain phenomenon that resembles marry-your-rapist laws exists in some U.S. states, notably Missouri and formerly Florida. This results from loopholes in laws that allow for marriage below the age of consent, thus circumventing statutory rape laws.\n\nThe age of consent in Missouri is 17. According to a March 2018 article in the \"Journal Star (Peoria)\", more than 300 men aged 21 or older married with 15-year-old girls in the state of Missouri between 1999 and 2015. For the men who had premarital sex with the girls they later married, this would constitute statutory rape according to Missouri law, which defines statutory rape as \"anyone 21 or older having sex with someone younger than 17 outside of marriage\". However, sex is legal within marriage, even with a minor, and Missouri allows marriage from the age of 15. This creates a loophole by which statutory rape can be covered up if the marriage is concluded before the authorities find out sexual intercourse has taken place (especially if it resulted in a pregnancy). This allows for the suspect to be exempt from prosecution (for example, imprisonment and having to register as a sex offender). Social pressure could be put on the alleged victim to agree to marry her statutory rapist to make him avoid punishment. Moreover, because Missouri's age loophole, a number of out-of-state couples come to Missouri to marry.\n\nThe age of consent in Florida is 18. However, until March 2018, the state of Florida allowed marriage without any minimum age for a girl if she was pregnant and a judge approved of the marriage. In this manner, the man who impregnated her could avoid being prosecuted for statutory rape. The current law requires anyone seeking marriage to be at least 18 years old, or 17 with the other partner not being more than two years older and the minor having received parental consent; pregnancy is no longer a factor.\n\n\"Note: The table can be sorted alphabetically or chronologically using the icons.\"\n"}

She had three sisters and two brothers, and attended West Division High School. She graduated from Chicago Normal School, a teachers' college, and taught for five years, before deciding to attend law school, at the age of 25. In 1892, she enrolled at Northwestern University School of Law, from which she graduated; she was admitted to the Illinois Bar by 1894. \n\nKnown as a social reformer, during the Progressive Era, Mary Bartelme devoted much of her life to the reform of juvenile laws and the welfare of children. In 1897, she was named Cook County Public Guardian, the first woman in this post. She became known throughout Illinois as a tireless advocate for children; her compassion for the girls who came before her earned her the nickname \"Mother Barthelme.\" She would later acquire another nickname-- \"Suitcase Mary,\" because when she sent girls to foster homes, she always provided them with clean clothes, packed in a new suitcase.\n\nBartelme believed that there was dramatic social neglect of girls, that parents must speak frankly with their daughters about sex, and that poverty was the main cause of delinquency. In May 1912, she was named an Assistant Judge in the Juvenile Court of Cook County. Then, in March 1913 Bartelme convened a special Girls' Court, which heard cases of delinquent and dependent girls, many of them prostitutes. All personnel in this closed court were female, which was felt to encourage a more open discussion of sexual and other private matters. Bartelme later established three Mary Clubs for girls who were not able to return to their parents, supported by volunteer services, as an alternative to state institutions. The first two clubs, which started in 1914 and 1916, accepted white girls; the last one, started in 1921, accepted girls of color. More than 2,000 girls passed through these group homes in a space of ten years.\n\nIn late 1923, she was elected Judge of the Circuit Court of Cook County, and she was re-elected in 1927. After a distinguished career, she retired in June 1933. Prior to her official retirement, in May, more than 2000 well-wishers honored her with a luncheon, at which she was praised for her many achievements.\n\nAfter she retired, Judge Bartelme moved to the west coast, residing in Carmel, California, where she lived with a niece. She occasionally returned to Chicago for a visit. In California, she continued to do speaking engagements, discussing the need to improve the juvenile justice system. She died in late July 1954, at age 88. One of her final requests was that upon her death, in lieu of flowers, donations would be made to the Mary Bartelme Clubs, which were still in operation.\n\nMary Bartelme would later be described as the single most important person in the first 25 years of the Cook County Juvenile Court, the first juvenile court established in the U.S.\n\nIn September 1957, a new Chicago elementary school that was named for her opened. It was able to accommodate more than 400 students. The school was located on Ridge in Rogers Park. It was torn down sometime in the 1970s to make way for a senior citizen apartment home.\n\nMary Bartelme Park, in the West Loop area of Chicago, is also named in her honor.\n\n"}
{"id": "4314203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4314203", "title": "Master (judiciary)", "text": "Master (judiciary)\n\nA master is a judge in the courts of England and in numerous other jurisdictions based on the common law tradition. A master's jurisdiction is generally confined to civil proceedings and is a subset of that of a justice. Masters are typically involved in hearing trials, case management, and in some jurisdictions dispute resolution or adjudication of specific issues referred by judges.\n\nBesides the courts of England and Wales, masters may be found in the Republic of Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, several Caribbean countries and a number of Canadian provinces. Several state courts in the United States utilize masters or similar officers and also make extensive use of special masters.\n\nJudicial officials exercising a master's jurisdiction are in some jurisdictions referred to as Registrars and Deputy Registrars.\n\nIn England and Wales a master is a sworn judge in the High Court having a jurisdiction similar to that of a Justice of the High Court in civil matters within the division of the court to which the master is appointed. The role of a master in the High Court of Justice of England and Wales is concerned primarily with trial and case management of High Court civil claims in London excluding committals to prison, judicial review and criminal cases. There are masters in the Queen's Bench and Chancery Divisions and the Costs Office (Taxing Masters/Costs Judges) and their roles differ slightly.\n\nSuch a person is addressed in court as, for example, \"Master Smith\". This is so whether the master is male or female, or as either 'Master' or 'Judge'. A similar type of master exists in the Court system of Northern Ireland, in several Canadian and Australian jurisdictions as well as in other countries whose court system is based on that of England.\n\nThe office of master is of ancient origins dating from at least the 12th century, though masters in Chancery were abolished in the 19th century and a new office of Chancery Master was recreated later. There are masters in the Chancery and Queen's Bench divisions of the High Court of Justice and the Costs Office of the High Court. The Senior Master of the Queen's Bench Division also bears the title of Queen's Remembrancer which is one of the oldest judicial offices in England.\n\nIn the Inns of Court, the members of the governing body are known as \"Masters of the Bench\" or, more commonly, \"benchers\". In the context of the functions they perform in that capacity (but not otherwise) they will be known as, for example, \"Master Smith\" (whether they are male or female). This will be so even if in other contexts they use a higher title: hence, a High Court Judge who is a Master of the Bench will be known in his or her Inn as \"Master Smith\", in private life as Sir John Smith, and on the bench as Mr Justice Smith; likewise a law lord will be known in the inn as \"Master Woolf\" even if he is privately and professionally known by the peerage title of \"Lord Woolf\".\n\nThe High Court's Registrar, Senior Deputy Registrars and Deputy Registrars serve as Masters of the High Court in civil cases in the court's Court of First Instance.\n\nUnder the Court Officers Act 1926, the Master of the High Court and taxing masters are not judges but rather \"quasi-judicial office holders\".\n\nIn Canada the structure of the court system is primarily a provincial responsibility and the superior courts of the provinces have different names. Masters are found in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta, the Court of Queen's Bench of Manitoba and the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. There are part-time taxing masters in the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador. There is a similar office of prothonotary in the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island and in the Federal Court.\n\nThe jurisdiction of a Master is fixed by provincial statute and the rules of court. Masters are appointed by the provincial government. As a result, while Masters sit in a superior court, they do not have the \"inherent jurisdiction\" of the judges of those courts, who are appointed by the federal government and whose authority is derived from the Constitution of Canada and the Crown. Their jurisdiction is usually limited to procedural and Interlocutory matters heard in chambers. Consequently, though of the superior court, Masters are concurrently subordinate to the judges of that court insofar as application of judicial precedent is concerned. Masters commonly also sit as Registrars in Bankruptcy.\n\nIn the Federal Court of Canada, a judicial officer with much the same powers as a Master is called a Prothonotary.\n\nTraditionally a Master is referred to as \"Master Smith\" or, in court, as \"Master\". In some jurisdictions, Masters are now referred to as \"your honour\".\n\nMasters and Prothonotaries are independent judicial officers although they do not have the full level of security of tenure afforded to federally appointed judges.\n\nIn Alberta, British Columbia and Manitoba, masters have the same terms of appointment as provincial judges. This was formerly the case in Ontario as well but after the High Court of Justice and District Courts were merged, in 1986 a new office of Case Management Master was created.\n\nIn Ontario Case Management Masters have all of the authority of traditional masters as well as additional jurisdiction to manage actions and engage in dispute resolution processes. They are appointed by Order in Council and can only be removed for cause by the Chief Justice following a formal disciplinary process.\n\nIn Ontario the distinction between \"chambers\" and \"court\" has been abolished. When masters preside they sit as the court and their function is to perform tasks that would otherwise fall to superior court judges. Besides the jurisdiction to hear most interlocutory motions in civil matters, case management masters in Ontario also preside at status hearings, case conferences and pre-trials. They frequently act as referees to hear trials in construction lien matters, mortgage references or issues referred by judges. Case management masters also provide dispute resolution services and sit as Registrars in Bankruptcy.\n\nIn the High Court of New Zealand, Associate Judges perform the same role as Masters in the High Court of Justice in England and Wales. They were previously referred to as Masters, however the title was changed on 20 May 2004, and all existing Masters were renamed Associate Judges.\n\nThe Masters are the junior judges on the High Court of Fiji.\n\n"}
{"id": "50922806", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50922806", "title": "Matal v. Tam", "text": "Matal v. Tam\n\nMatal v. Tam, 582 U.S. ___ (2017) (previously known as Lee v. Tam), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court affirmed unanimously the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that the provisions of the Lanham Act's prohibiting the registration of trademarks that may \"disparage\" persons, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols with the United States Patent and Trademark Office violated the First Amendment.\n\nBefore the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington D.C., the case was titled \"In Re Tam\". This case was heard on appeal after Simon Tam applied for a trademark registration on the mark \"The Slants\" for his band from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) and was denied. The PTO interpreted the likely meaning of \"The Slants\" as a term to refer to people of Asian descent, despite claims from the band that the actual meaning referred to their perspective and that they were repurposing the term from an offensive slur. The PTO used anecdotal sources like Urban Dictionary to support their claims, while ignoring survey data, linguistics experts, and legal declarations from Asian American community leaders. The opinion was heard en banc by the Federal Circuit and the majority, which was written by Circuit Judge Moore, determined that the Disparaging Provision () of the Lanham Act is unconstitutional and found that Simon Tam was entitled to trademark registration. Tam was represented by John C. Connell of Archer & Greiner and Ron Coleman and Joel MacMull, now of Mandelbaum Salsburg.\n\nThe United States government petitioned the United States Supreme Court for writ of certiorari, which was granted in September 2016. In addition to this case, there was another case before the Fourth Circuit, \"Pro-Football, Inc. v. Blackhorse\", 112 F. Supp. 3d 439 (E.D. Va. 2015) to decide the same issue of whether or not the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act is unconstitutional. Despite an attempt by Pro Football to merge the two cases, the Supreme Court refused to grant the motion. \n\nSection 2(a)'s ban on the federal registration of \"immoral\" or \"scandalous\" marks originated in the trademark legislation of the Lanham Act. A disparaging mark is a mark which \"dishonors by comparison with what is inferior, slights, deprecates, degrades, or affects or injures by unjust comparison.\"\n\nSimon Tam is the founder and bassist for the Asian-American dance-rock band The Slants. Tam named his band The Slants to \"reclaim\" and \"take ownership\" of Asian stereotypes. On March 5, 2010, Tam filed his first application to register THE SLANTS. After several appeals, the application was eventually abandoned. On November 14, 2011, Tam filed his second application (App. No. 85/472,044) seeking to register the mark THE SLANTS for \"Entertainment in the nature of live performances by a musical band,\" based on his use of the mark since 2006. The examiner refused to register Tam's mark, finding it likely disparaging to \"persons of Asian descent\" under § 2(a). The examiner found that the mark likely referred to people of Asian descent in a disparaging way, explaining that the term \"slants\" had \"a long history of being used to deride and mock a physical feature\" of people of Asian descent. The examiner found that a substantial composite of persons of Asian descent might find the term offensive precisely because it was being used by an Asian American band, saying: “Here, the evidence is uncontested that applicant is a founding member of a band that is self described as being composed of members of Asian descent...Thus, the association of the term SLANTS with those of Asian descent is evidenced by how the applicant uses the work - as the name of an all Asian-American band.”\n\nDue to this determination, Tam decided to appeal before the Federal Circuit.\n\nNo trademark by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished from the goods of others shall be refused registration on the principal register on account of its nature unless it—<br><br>(a) Consists of or comprises immoral, deceptive, or scandalous matter; or matter which may disparage or falsely suggest a connection with persons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols, or bring them into contempt, or disrepute; or a geographical indication which, when used on or in connection with wines or spirits, identifies a place other than the origin of the goods and is first used on or in connection with wines or spirits by the applicant on or after one year after the date on which the WTO Agreement (as defined in section 3501(9) of title 19) enters into force with respect to the United States.\n\nViewpoint discrimination occurs when the government is not only banning certain content or topics, but certain ideas. The test for viewpoint discrimination is “[o]ther things being equal, viewpoint discrimination occurs when government allows one message while prohibiting the messages of those who can reasonably be expected to respond.” Additionally, viewpoint discrimination involves intent to discourage one viewpoint and advance another. The general concern being that the government will try to eradicate, not just content from the marketplace, but certain viewpoints—whether positive or negative. If something rises to the level of viewpoint-based discrimination, it is deemed to be unconstitutional.\n\nIn \"Reed v. Town of Gilbert\", the court said that, “Government regulation of speech is content based if a law applies to particular speech because of the topic discussed or the idea or message expressed.” The Court further determined that, “This commonsense meaning of the phrase ‘content based’ requires a court to consider whether a regulation of speech ‘on its face’ draws distinctions based on the message a speaker conveys.” For that reason, content-based discrimination is presumptively invalid and if something is found to be discriminating on the basis of content, it must survive strict scrutiny.\n\nAccording to Nat’l Assoc. of Mfrs. v. Taylor: “[t]o satisfy strict scrutiny, the government must establish three elements: (1) \"the interests the government proffers in support\" of the statute must be \"properly characterized as 'compelling'\"; (2) the statute must \"effectively advance [] those interests\"; and (3) the statute must be \"narrowly tailored to advance the compelling interests asserted.\"\n\nFor \"Central Hudson\" to apply, the court would have to determine that the statute at issue deals with commercial speech. From \"Central Hudson\", the Supreme Court developed a four-part test to determine whether a statute should pass muster. The test looks to see: (1) Whether the expression is protected by the First Amendment—for it to fall here, it must concern lawful activity and not be misleading; (2) whether the asserted governmental interest is substantial; (3) whether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted; and (4) whether the regulation is no more extensive than necessary to serve that interest—there must be a “reasonable fit” between the government's ends and the means of achieving those ends.\n\nIn order for something to be classified as government speech, the court looks at four factors: (1) the central purpose of the program in which the speech in question occurs; (2) the degree of editorial control exercised by the government or private entities over the content of the speech; (3) the identity of the literal speaker; and (4) whether the government or the private entity bears the ultimate responsibility for the content of the speech.\n\nThe central issue before the Federal Circuit was to determine whether or not the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act is unconstitutional and should therefore be voided. Under the case name \"In Re Tam\", 808 F.3d 1321 (Fed. Cir. 2015), Circuit Judge Moore decided that the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act is unconstitutional for various reasons and that Tam should be granted trademark protection on THE SLANTS.\n\nThe court determined that the Lanham Act was viewpoint-based discriminatory because whenever the government chooses to deny trademark protection to a mark, it is doing so because of the message the mark conveys. The government tried to defend their position before the Federal Circuit by saying that they should be able to deny protection to the most \"vile\" racial epithets and images; however, the Federal Circuit said that \"When the government discriminates against speech because it disapproves of the message conveyed by the speech, it discriminates on the basis of viewpoint.\" The Federal Circuit bolstered their stance that it is viewpoint discriminatory because the PTO refused to register \"The Slants\"; however, the PTO has registered marks such as \"Celebrasians\" and \"Asian Efficiency\". The Federal Circuit found the only difference between marks such as \"The Slants\" versus \"Celebrasians\" and \"Asian Efficiency\" is the messages conveyed. The Slants could be seen as being derogatory towards those of Asian descent versus positive. Since the court determined that the disparaging provision is viewpoint discriminatory, then it is immediately unconstitutional.\n\nIn the alternative, the Federal Circuit determined that the disparaging provision is content-based discriminatory, in addition to viewpoint-discriminatory. Additionally, the Federal Circuit came to the determination that even though trademarks inherently deal more with commercial speech versus expressive speech, that when the government cancels a mark under the disparaging provision, it is affecting more of the expressive aspects of speech and not the commerciality of it. Therefore, the Federal Circuit found that if the disparaging provision is not found to be viewpoint discriminatory (in light of a higher court potentially overturning parts of this case) that it must be content-based discriminatory and must survive strict scrutiny unless an exception applied.\n\nThe government raised the argument that the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act should be reviewed under intermediate scrutiny by way of the \"Central Hudson\" test, because the inherent nature of trademarks are commercial. However, the Federal Circuit determined that when the PTO chooses to cancel trademarks under the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act, it is usually because of their expressive components and not their commercial components. The Federal Circuit went on to say that commercial speech mixed with expressive speech should be treated as expressive under deciding whether to apply strict or intermediate scrutiny. Therefore, the Federal Circuit decided that strict scrutiny should be applied.\n\nIn the Federal Circuit's effort to show the unconstitutionality of the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act, they chose to analyze the provision under the \"Central Hudson\" intermediate scrutiny. The part of the \"Central Hudson\" test that the Federal Circuit failed the Lanham Act on was the \"legitimate Interest\" element (See above).\n\nFor this element, the government raised three arguments for why they had a legitimate interest:\n\nThe Federal Circuit determined that none of the arguments raised by the government created a legitimate enough interest to pass the \"Central Hudson\" test. Since it does not pass the \"Central Hudson\" test, the Federal Circuit determined that it would also not pass strict scrutiny, since strict scrutiny requires a statute to rise to a higher standard.\n\nThe Government raised the argument that the Lanham Act should be classified as a Government Subsidy and therefore exempt from the strict scrutiny requirement. The Federal Circuit ultimately determined that no taxpayer dollars are used in registering trademarks, that it is completely user-funded in their application fees; therefore, the Federal Circuit determined that this does not fall under the government subsidy exception to strict scrutiny.\n\nThe Government also raised the argument that the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act is government speech and should therefore fall outside of the purview of the first amendment. The government argues this because of the ability to place the \"®\" or \"TM\" on the registered mark. The government found this argument to be without merit. The Federal Circuit said that the only message the government conveys when a mark is registered with the PTO is that \"a mark is registered.\" The court cited many reasons for their determination, but, most prominently, was a policy consideration. The Court was concerned that if they allowed this argument to win the day, then it would also affect other areas of law, such as Copyright and Patent law. The general concern being that the government could then control what they would and would not grant protections to and would therefore affect the types of speech expressed; this would have the effect of abridging free speech, which is a violation of the first amendment.\n\nIn addition to agreeing with Circuit Judge Moore's opinion, Judge O'Malley added that she believes the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act is unconstitutional under the vagueness doctrine too.\n\nCircuit Judge Dyk generally agrees with the opinion of the majority in that the disparaging provision of the Lanham Act is unconstitutional; however, in his view, the majority err in going \"beyond the facts of this case and holding the statute facially unconstitutional as applied to purely commercial speech.\" Judge Dyk also believed that many trademarks lack expressive characteristics that would merit First Amendment protection and therefore the analysis should be under the \"Central Hudson\" test and not strict scrutiny.\n\nJudge Lourie disagreed with the majority in many ways outlined below:\n\nJudge Reyna disagreed with the majority in the sense that trademark are exclusively commercial speech and should therefore be analyzed under the \"Central Hudson\" test and intermediate scrutiny. From here, Judge Reyna determined that the government does have a legitimate interest in promoting the orderly flow of commerce and therefore, should pass intermediate scrutiny. Judge Reyna stated that when you balance the legitimate interest of the disparaging provision versus how narrowly tailored the statute is, that it makes sense that the Lanham Act should survive scrutiny.\n\nThe United States Patent and Trademark Office appealed the decision to the United States Supreme Court, presenting the following question in its petition for certiorari: \"whether the disparagement provision in 15 U.S.C. 1052(a) is facially invalid under the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment\"? The Supreme Court agreed to grant certiorari in September 2016. Oral arguments were heard on January 18, 2017. \n\nOn June 19, 2017 the Supreme Court delivered judgment in favor of Tam, voting unanimously to affirm the lower court. The majority opinion stated \"The disparagement clause violates the First Amendment’s Free Speech Clause. Contrary to the Government’s contention, trademarks are private, not government speech.\"\n\nThis decision is another ruling that strikes down 'Hate Speech' laws that violate the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause. Justice Samuel Alito writes in this unanimous decision:Speech that demeans on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, age, disability, or any other similar ground is hateful; but the proudest boast of our free speech jurisprudence is that we protect the freedom to express “the thought that we hate.” \"United States \"v. \"Schwimmer\", 279 U. S. 644, 655 (1929) (Holmes, J., dissenting).Justice Neil Gorsuch was not yet a member of the court during the oral argument, so he did not participate in the decision.\n\n\n"}

An omnibus bill is a single document that is accepted in a single vote by a legislature but packages together several measures into one or combines diverse subjects.\n\nBecause of their large size and scope, omnibus bills limit opportunities for debate and scrutiny. Historically, omnibus bills have sometimes been used to pass controversial amendments. For this reason, some consider omnibus bills to be anti-democratic.\n\nIn the United States, examples include reconciliation bills, combined appropriations bills, and private relief and claims bills.\n\nOmnibus legislation is routinely used by the United States Congress to group together the budgets of all departments in one year in an omnibus spending bill. For example, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 was designed to help reduce the federal deficit by approximately $496 billion over five years through restructuring of the tax code.\n\nDuring the 19th century, there were three notable omnibus bills.\n\nThe Compromise of 1850 had five disparate provisions designed by Sen. Henry Clay of Kentucky. His purpose was to pacify sectional differences that threatened to provoke the secession of the slave states. The Fugitive Slave Act was the most infamous of the five compromise components, and was almost universally excoriated by abolitionists, the chief exception being Sen. Daniel Webster of Massachusetts who prioritized preservation of the Union. Sen. Thomas Hart Benton, a Missouri slaveholder, opposed the omnibus compromise as an \"unmanageable mass of incongruous bills, each an impediment to the other...\" Nonetheless, the bill passed Congress and accomplished its purpose. Disunion and civil war were delayed for a decade.\n\nThe Omnibus Act of June 1868 admitted seven southern States as having satisfied the requirements of the Reconstruction Acts.\n\nThe Omnibus Act of February 22, 1889, provided for the admission of four new states to the Union — North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana and Washington.\n\nIn Canada one famous omnibus bill became the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1968-69, a 126-page, 120-clause amendment to the Criminal Code, which dealt with issues as diverse as homosexuality, prostitution, abortion, gambling, gun control and drunk driving. Likewise, Jobs and Growth Act (2012). In the Republic of Ireland, the Second Amendment of the Constitution was an omnibus constitutional law, enacted in 1941, that made many unrelated changes to the country's fundamental law.\n\nSimilarly, in New Zealand, an omnibus bill was passed in November 2016 that enacted legislation required for New Zealand to enter the Trans Pacific Partnership.\n\nSection 55 of the Constitution of Australia requires that laws imposing taxation \"deal only with the imposition of taxation\" and \"deal with one subject of taxation only\" (except those relating to customs and excise); other purported provisions in a piece of tax legislation are of no legal effect. This does not outlaw all omnibus bills, but renders unconstitutional any omnibus bill imposing taxation.\n\n"}

Thus probate researchers must have extensive knowledge of the law to know which family members are legally entitled to inherit. They also employ specialized genealogical and investigative techniques to search public records and databases to identify the extended family of the deceased, often starting with no more than a name and date of death and in some cases looking for relatives as distant as second cousins. In many cases the heirs that are finally identified have little or no knowledge of the person from whom they are inheriting.\n\nProbate researchers are hired by solicitors in the United Kingdom, or Estate Attorneys in the United States. It is also common for them to independently review many cases to find a single case with missing or unknown heirs.\n\nThe BBC has made nine series (180 programs) of Heir Hunters, shown on UK BBC TV about a number of UK companies.

It served over the period 16 November 2006 through 23 November 2012 i.e. one (1) year and seven (7) calendar days (which ended with the appointment and swearing in of the new PRBoA Chairman, who heads the 2nd reconstituted PRBoA).\n\nThe PRBoA is one of 46 Professional Regulatory Boards (PRBs) under the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) of the Republic of the Philippines and served as the primary spokes-entity for the nine (9) Professional Regulatory Boards (\"PRBs\") making up the Philippine (PH) Technology Professions i.e. the built and natural environment professions of agriculture, architecture, chemistry, environmental planning, forestry, interior design, landscape architecture and master plumbing. The State-regulated professions of architecture, environmental planning, interior design, landscape architecture and master plumbing are also collectively considered as the environmental design professions.\n\nThe PRBoA as an entity is under the administrative control and supervision of the PRC, a quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative entity that forms part of the executive branch of the Philippine Government. As such, it does not act independently on matters involving the regulation of the practice of the profession of architecture in the Philippines. The reconstituted PRBoA is a collegial body and is active in the areas of executive action relating to the implementation and enforcement of \"Republic Act\" No. 9266 (otherwise known as the Philippine \"\"Architecture Act\" of 2004\"), its implementing rules and regulations (IRR) and derivative regulations e.g. other executive issuances of the PRBoA through the PRC.\n\nThe 16 November 2006 to 23 November 2012 reconstituted PRBoA was composed of three (2) privately practicing architects (working only on a part-time engagement as PRBoA members):\n\nFrom 2009 through 2012/ 2013, all three (3) 2006-2012 PRBoA Members served in a holdover capacity, until their respective replacements were appointed by the President of the Republic of the Philippines (PH).\n\nAs of 23 November 2012, the 2006-2012 reconstituted PRBoA regulated the practice of about 30,000 PH-registered architects (RAs) nationwide/ overseas i.e. natural (not juridical) persons. Of this number of RAs, it is conservatively estimated that less than half (approx. 14,000) have valid licenses to practice i.e. a Registered and Licensed Architect (RLA) and that up to 50.0% of said RLAs may already working outside the country. The PRBoA also regulates the practice of foreign architects (FA) i.e. only as natural (not as juridical) persons, wishing to engage in the professional practice of architecture for any building project on Philippine soil for a limited period of time and of architectural firms (sole/single proprietorships, partnerships, corporations, associations and joint ventures). Only individual foreign architects/ FAs (not foreign architectural firms/ FAFs) are allowed to practice architecture in the Philippines together with counterpart Filipino RLAs and only if they are issued a special/ temporary permit (STP) in accordance with R.A. No. 9266. The PRBoA supports the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Architects Register and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations/ ASEAN Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA) and its ASEAN Architects' Council (AAC) for borderless architectural practice/s, as qualified under the protocols/agreements and as qualified by valid and subsisting laws on architectural practice in the Philippines.\n\nThe PRBoA also administers the Licensure Examination for Architects (LEA) given twice in Manila annually by the Philippine Government and of Foreign LEAs (FLEAs) given as part of the now annual PRC Special Professional Licensure Board Examinations (SPLBEs) in such countries as Saudi Arabia (KSA), Qatar, Dubai and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for expatriate Filipinos (overseas Filipino workers or \"OFWs\"). Over the past six (6) years, the LEA mortality rate ranged from 49.0% to 68% per examination. Over the past 57 years of the regulation of Philippine architectural practice, only an average of about 400 annually are granted certificates and licenses to practice. With the elimination of manual drafting in the LEA subject of Architectural Design and Site Planning (ADSP) starting in late 2009 and with other LEA/ FLEA-related reforms, the LEA/ FLEA passing rates have more or less stabilized at 50 - 52%.\n\nAmong the executive concerns being presently addressed/ already addressed by the 2006 - 2012 reconstituted PRBoA are: 1) general information dissemination concerning the laws/ regulations on architectural practice, 2) enforcement mechanisms against illegal practitioners (non-RAs and non-RLAs) and 3) the completion of the amendments to the 1979 Standards of Professional Practice/SPP (otherwise known as the Architect's National Code/ ANC) in 2010. Among the quasi-judicial responsibilities being discharged by the PRBoA include the hearing of and the promulgation of decisions on administrative cases filed against RAs or RLAs and the review of cases against illegal practitioners for endorsement to prosecutors and Philippine courts.\n\nThe practice of architecture in the Philippines is only a professional privilege that is granted to individuals and firms (natural and juridical persons), duly registered and licensed in accordance with Philippine law i.e. limited only to RLAs and registered architectural firms (RAFs). It was never a right accorded to RAs nor to any other State-regulated and licensed professional (RLP), specifically certain PH civil engineers (CEs) and their organizations who/ which insist that they too can exercise the same professional privileges as RLAs. In the case of RLAs, such an exclusive professional privilege can be suspended or revoked by the PRBoA for cause/s provided under law and only in accordance with due process.\n\nThe preparation, signing and sealing of architectural plans and documents are only for RLAs and not for any other RLP or other unqualified entities under PH law (specifically PH civil engineers and other unregistered persons as defined by law, specifically by R.A. No. 9266). As such, the 2006 - 2012 reconstituted PRBoA has actively campaigned since early 2007 for the full implementation and enforcement of the pertinent provisions under R.A. No. 9266, which all limit the preparation, signing and sealing of architectural plans and documents only to RLAs and which mandate all officials of the PH national and local governments to fully implement and enforce the said provisions. This means that even RAs who have not updated their licenses to practice architecture are prohibited from practicing until such time that they are able to renew such licenses (in the form of renewable identification/ ID cards).\n\nAmong the legal steps taken by the PRBoA to fully implement and enforce R.A. No. 9266 include the filing of graft charges against national and local government officials who refuse to implement and enforce R.A. No. 9266 and the harmonized provisions of the 2004 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of P.D. No. 1096 (the 1977 National Building Code of the Philippines/ NBCP). Also impleaded in the said suits are private individuals who willfully resist or violate the said laws.\n\nAmong the legislative initiatives of the 2006 - 2012 reconstituted PRBoA are participation in collaborative efforts to repeal the 1977 National Building Code of the Philippines (NBCP or Presidential Decree No. 1096), the amendment of anti-graft laws, the review of bills that tend to undermine professional architectural practice, the professionalization of the Local Government Unit (LGU) position of Building Official (BO) and Assistant Building Official (ABO), bills on non-mobile billboards, consulting service regulation and various other related concerns.\n"}

She came as a dependent of her father who had a student visa. The father left in 2003 but Tigere remained with her mother who over-stayed. The UK Border Agency became aware of this situation in 2010 and granted them temporary permission to remain which became discretionary leave to remain in 2012. Tigere will be entitled to apply for indefinite leave to remain in 2018 but until that time she was unable to apply for a student loan despite achieving three A-Levels and a place at Northumbria University to study International Business Management.\n\nThe case was brought on behalf of Tigere by Public Interest Lawyers who argued that the policy was an infringement of Tigere's right to education under Article 2 of the First Protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights. This provision reads \"[n]o person shall be denied the right to education\" and the negative formulation does mean that there is no automatic entitlement to public support. However Tigere argued that this ought to be read in line with Article 14 of the Convention that states her rights \"shall be secured without discrimination on any ground\" (in this case her immigration status).\n\nThe High Court found in favour of Tigere and held that the blanket ban on her eligibility for a student loan based on her immigration status was a disproportionate interference on her right to education and also constituted discrimination under Article 14.\n\nThe Secretary of State appealed the decision to the Court of Appeal which held that the case concerned an area of \"national strategic policy for the distribution of scarce resources in a field of great social importance\" and therefore a wide margin of appreciation should be afforded to government policy. With this in mind the appeal was allowed.\n\nThe Supreme Court allowed Ms. Tigere's appeal by a majority of three to two. Lady Hale (with whom Lord Kerr agreed) gave the leading judgment and concluded:\n\nLord Hughes offered a concurring judgment but slightly disagreed with Lady Hale by suggesting that any future rules drawn up by the Secretary of State would not necessarily have to include an 'exceptional case' discretion. In particular he noted:\nThe joint minority judgment handed down by Lords Reed and Sumption argued that the appropriate test is whether the scheme is 'manifestly without foundation' and concluded that:\nSolicitor Paul Heron, of Public Interest Lawyers, said: \n\n“My client is a talented and brave individual and is a credit to the comprehensive school system in Britain.\n\nShe has worked hard to obtain excellent grades. Yet she had been denied her opportunity to go to university for the past two years. She has faced this government down.\n\nThe regulations which were introduced by the last Tory/Liberal government made absolutely no economic sense and appear to have been dreamed up in a Daily Mail think tank.”\n\nThe Coram Children’s Legal Centre provided evidence for the hearing. Their solicitor, Alison East, said:\n\nThe Daily Express noted that the judgment came \"as figures revealed that students from the European Union have dodged paying back £43million in taxpayer-funded loans.\"\n\nJust for Kids Law intervened in the case and estimated that between 600-1,000 students were affected by the restrictions each year.

{"id": "6544610", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6544610", "title": "Red Shirts (United States)", "text": "Red Shirts (United States)\n\nThe Red Shirts or Redshirts of the Southern United States were white supremacist paramilitary groups that were active in the late 19th century in the last years and after the end of the Reconstruction era of the United States. Red Shirt groups originated in Mississippi in 1875, when Democratic Party private terror units adopted red shirts to make themselves more visible and threatening to Southern Republicans, both whites and freedmen. Similar groups in the Carolinas also adopted red shirts.\n\nAmong the most prominent Red Shirts were the supporters of Democratic Party candidate Wade Hampton during the campaigns for the South Carolina gubernatorial elections of 1876 and 1878. The Red Shirts were one of several paramilitary organizations, such as the White League in Louisiana, arising from the continuing efforts of white Democrats to regain political power in the South in the 1870s. These groups acted as \"the military arm of the Democratic Party.\"\n\nWhile sometimes engaging in violent acts of terrorism, the Red Shirts, the White League, rifle clubs, and similar groups in the late nineteenth century worked openly and were better organized than the secret vigilante groups such as the Ku Klux Klan. They used organization, intimidation and force to achieve political purposes of restoring the Democrats to power, overturning Republicans, and repressing civil and voting rights of freedmen. During the 1876, 1898 and 1900 campaigns in North Carolina, the Red Shirts played prominent roles in intimidating non-Democratic Party voters.\n\nAccording to E. Merton Coulter in \"The South During Reconstruction\" (1947), the red shirt was adopted in Mississippi in 1875 by \"southern brigadiers\" of the Democratic Party who were opposed to black Republicans. The Red Shirts disrupted Republican rallies, intimidated or assassinated black leaders, and discouraged and suppressed black voting at the polls.\n\nMen wearing red shirts appeared in Charleston, South Carolina on August 25, 1876, during a Democratic torchlight parade. It was to mock the \"waving the bloody shirt\" speech by Benjamin Franklin Butler of Massachusetts, in which he was falsely claimed to have held up a shirt stained with the blood of a carpetbagger whipped by the Ku Klux Klan during the Reconstruction Era. \"Waving the bloody shirt\" became an idiom in the South, attributed to rhetoric by Republican politicians such as Oliver Hazard Perry Morton in the Senate, who used emotional accounts of injustices done to Northern soldiers and carpetbaggers to bolster support for the Republicans' Reconstruction policies in South Carolina. The red shirt symbolism quickly spread. Suspects accused in the Hamburg Massacre wore red shirts as they marched on September 5 to their arraignment in Aiken, South Carolina. Martin Gary, the organizer in South Carolina of the Democratic campaign in 1876, mandated that his supporters were to wear red shirts at all party rallies and functions.\n\nWearing a red shirt became a source of pride and resistance to Republican rule for white Democrats in South Carolina. Women sewed red flannel shirts and made other garments of red. It also became fashionable for women to wear red ribbons in their hair or about their waists. Young men adopted the red shirts to express militancy after being too young to have fought in the Civil War.\n\nState Democrats organized parades and rallies in every county of South Carolina. Many of the participants were armed and mounted; all wore red. Mounted men gave an impression of greater power and numbers. When Wade Hampton and other Democrats spoke, the Red Shirts would respond enthusiastically, shouting the campaign slogan, \"Hurrah for Hampton.\" This created a massive spectacle that united and motivated his followers.\n\nRed Shirts sought to intimidate both white and black watchers into voting for the Democrats or not at all. The Red Shirts and similar groups were especially active in those states with an African-American majority. They broke up Republican meetings, disrupted their organizing, and intimidated black voters at the polls. Many freedmen stopped voting from fear, and others voted for Democrats under pressure. The Red Shirts did not hesitate to use violence, nor did the other private militia groups. In the Piedmont counties of Aiken, Edgefield, and Barnwell, freedmen who voted were driven from their homes and whipped, while some of their leaders were murdered. During the 1876 presidential election, Democrats in Edgefield and Laurens counties voted \"early and often\", while freedmen were barred from the polls.\n\nArmed and mounted Red Shirts accompanied Hampton on his tour of the state. They attended Republican meetings and would demand equal time, but they usually only stood in silence. At times, Red Shirts would hold a barbecue nearby to lure Republicans and try to convince them to vote for the Democratic ticket.\n\nHampton positioned himself as a statesman, promising support for education and offering protection from violence that Governor Daniel Henry Chamberlain did not seem able to provide. Few freedmen voted for Hampton, and most remained loyal to the Republican Party of Abraham Lincoln. The 1876 campaign was the \"most tumultuous in South Carolina's history.\" \"An anti-Reconstruction historian later estimated that 150 Negroes were murdered in South Carolina during the campaign.\"\n\nAfter the election on November 7, a protracted dispute between Chamberlain and Hampton ensued as both claimed victory. Because of the massive election fraud, Edmund William McGregor Mackey, a Republican member of the South Carolina House of Representatives, called upon the \"Hunkidori Club\" from Charleston to eject Democratic members from Edgefield and Laurens counties from the House. Word spread through the state. By December 3, approximately 5,000 Red Shirts assembled at the State House to defend the Democrats. Hampton appealed for calm and the Red Shirts dispersed.\n\nAs a result of a national political compromise, President Rutherford B. Hayes ordered the removal of the Union Army from the state on April 3, 1877. The white Democrats completed their political takeover of South Carolina. In the gubernatorial election of 1878, the Red Shirts made a nominal appearance as Hampton was re-elected without opposition.\n\nFuture South Carolina Democratic politicians, such as Benjamin Tillman and Ellison D. Smith, proudly claimed their association in their youth with the Red Shirts as a \"bona fide\" for white supremacy.\n\nRed Shirts were active again around the 1896 and 1898 elections, allied with the Democrats' appeals to voters to support white supremacy, in an effort to avoid voters moving to the Populist fusion candidate, as some had done in the 1896 gubernatorial election.\n\nThe Red Shirts were part of a Democratic campaign to oppose the interracial coalition of Republicans and Populists, which had gained control of the state legislature in the 1894 election and elected a Republican governor in 1896. Such biracial coalitions had also occurred in other states across the South, in some cases overturning or threatening white Democratic control of state legislatures. Upper-class and middle-class white populations feared the empowerment of freedmen and poor whites. To break up the coalition, white Democrats used intimidation and outright violence to reduce black Republican voting and regained control of the state legislature in 1896.\n\nIntimidation and violence against blacks increased prior to the 1898 election throughout the state, especially in black-majority counties. On November 4, 1898, the \"Raleigh News & Observer\" noted,\n\nIn Wilmington, a biracial coalition of Republicans won the offices of mayor and aldermen in 1898. The mayor and two-thirds of the aldermen were white, elected from a black-majority city. But local white Democrats wanted power and took it six days after the election in the Wilmington Insurrection of 1898, the largest recognized \"coup d'état\" in United States history. After overthrowing the government, the mob attacked black areas of the city and killed numerous blacks, burning down houses, schools and churches. So many blacks left Wilmington permanently that the demographics changed, resulting in a white-majority city.\n\nWhite Democrats controlling the state legislature drafted an amendment to the state constitution that disfranchised most African Americans and many poor whites by establishing requirements for poll taxes and literacy tests, which raised barriers to voter registration. In 1900, the amendment was adopted by a statewide popular referendum in which black-voter turnout was suppressed.\n\nFrom 1896 to 1904, black voter turnout in North Carolina was reduced to near zero by the combination of such voter registration provisions together with more complicated rules for voting. This followed a pattern of similar state actions across the South, starting with the state of Mississippi's new constitution in 1890. After a generation of white supremacy, many people forgot that North Carolina once had thriving middle-class blacks.\n\nDue to the feelings of political devaluation among many white Democrats in North Carolina, the Democratic party and Red Shirts made it their goal to restore full and total power. The Red Shirts intimidated black voters by threat and outright attack, and practically eliminated the black vote in the state. Red Shirts were first spotted in North Carolina during the October 21, 1898, rally in Fayetteville. At this rally Benjamin Tillman, a prominent South Carolina Red Shirts leader, gave a speech that was followed by a plethora of Red Shirt activities in the state of North Carolina. The North Carolina Red Shirts were a conglomerate of all social classes, including teachers, farmers, merchants and some elite members of the Democratic Party. From that day on, Red Shirts chapters were particularly active in the southeastern part of North Carolina, including \"New Hanover, Brunswick, Columbus, and Robeson counties,\" all of which geographically lie next to the South Carolina border and had large black populations.\n\nTheir early activities were part of initiating the white supremacy movements of 1898 and 1900. These arose in reaction to the increase in election of numerous local and state black government officials in the State of North Carolina between the years of 1894 and 1897. This increase in the number of black officials forced the \"frightened and desperate Democratic Party\" to initiate the white supremacy campaign in which the Red Shirts would become integral partners. Unlike the Ku Klux Klan, the Red Shirts collaborated only with the Democratic Party. They operated openly, as they wanted the North Carolina population and non-Democrats to know the identities of their members. By the end of the election in 1898, they proved to be a potent political force.\n\nDuring the initial reign of Red Shirts terror, the senator of North Carolina, Sen. Jeter Pritchard (R), wrote to Pres. McKinley asking, \"Will you send deputy United States Marshal to preserve the peace?\" The Red Shirts used the tactics of intimidation and sometimes violence to suppress voting by non-Democrats. With the rise in intimidation by the Red Shirts, both blacks and threatened whites were buying weaponry to protect themselves. Pritchard noted in his letter that the Red Shirts were most active \"in counties where colored people predominate,\" and the paramilitary group targeted blacks.\n\nGov. Daniel L. Russell (R) said that along the southern edge of the state, \"armed and lawless\" men had taken over due to the increase in crimes and violent activities. The Red Shirts often disrupted many non-Democratic political meeting via \"threats, intimidation, and actual violence\". Through their intimidation, the Red Shirts successfully deterred many members of the counties from registering to vote in the 1898 state election. Due to the citizens being fearful to register, Gov. Russell issued a proclamation on October 26, 1898, asking all \"Ill-disposed persons ... to immediately desist from all unlawful practices ... Turbulent conduct, and to preserve peace.\" Governor Russell's proclamation did not sit well with the Red Shirts; they increased their activity.\n\nThe week before the 1898 election, the Red Shirts' activities were non-stop, and the threats were so recurrent that many Republicans and Fusionist speakers canceled their engagements; the entire Republican Fusion ticket withdrew in New Hanover County. A few days before the election on November 2, 1898, the \"Morning Star\" newspaper of Wilmington reported a large rally with the Red Shirt affiliate Claude Kitchin as the fiery speaker. The rally involved 1,000 men with red shirts who marched for 10 miles in the predominantly black areas of Richmond County, North Carolina. Their goal was \"to show their determination to rid themselves of Negro rule.\" The paper reported that \"many Negroes [had] taken their names from the registration list.\"\n\nDuring the November 8, 1898, election, Red Shirts enforced their previous activities by riding around the voting precincts on their horses, with rifles and shotguns ready, to deter all Republicans, Fusionists and African Americans from the polls. The Red Shirts' activity helped the Democrats win with a 25,000 majority, as headlined in the \"News and Observer.\" A large celebration on November 15 was organized by Josephus Daniels to commemorate \"white supremacy and rescuing the state from Negro-rule.\"\n\nThe election of 1900 was a special election because there was one held in August and another held in November. The white supremacy theme was repeated, with sayings such as \"White Rule for TarHeels,\" \"White Supremacy\", and \"No Negro Rule\". The Red Shirts and Democrats would ensure their win during the August special election, which was a Democratic ploy to disfranchise the black vote. The Democrat and Red Shirts felt that if they could \"demoralize black leaders,\" the black vote would decrease. On the day of the disfranchisement election in August, one prominent black leader, Abe Middleton, a former Republican county chairman of Duplin County, was symbolically \"killed\" when his wife found a \"pasteboard coffin\" in their garden. During a post-election hearing, Middleton testified that there was an increase in shooting near his home. Though the incidents did not faze Middleton, members of the black community saw this activity and refrained from voting. The intimidation activities of the Red Shirts were so successful that many African Americans abandoned their homes, some seeking refugee in swamps, as recounted by Dave Kennedy, a black voter of Duplin County.\n\nThe Red Shirts also continued to attack white Republicans and other opponents to the Democrats. \"The New York Times\", in an August 2, 1900, article, noted that the day before the election, the Red Shirts disrupted the speech of Mr. Teague and demolished the platform on which he spoke. The Red Shirts were indirectly supported by many law enforcement officials, who failed to take action against them in most counties throughout the state. Later, as Teague was traveling to Dunn County, during his canvassing tour of the state, he was kidnapped by the Red Shirts and driven out of town. Among other prominent non-Democratic speakers, Marion Butler and others were disrupted by the throwing of rotten eggs. Due to the increasingly disruptive activities of the Red Shirts, the Republican Party chairman of Johnson County sent a request for troops to Gov. Russell.\n\nOn the day of the 1900 election, the Red Shirts were even more obvious than in 1898. They rode around the voting polls with their guns and horses, intimidating blacks and other Republicans. The success of the disfranchisement of black votes in the August 1900 election, ultimately resulted in the November Democratic gubernatorial win of Charles Brantley Aycock over Adams, the Republican. The vote of 186,650 to 126,296 was noted as \"the largest majority ever given to a gubernatorial candidate\".\n\nAfter the Democratic win in November, the Red Shirts disappeared from public view. Because their members were primarily poor whites, the Democratic Party of elitist whites parted ways with the group. Thus the prevalence of Red Shirts declined upon the inauguration of Gov. Aycock.\n\nThe League of the South of South Carolina has a specialized membership category known as \"Red Shirts\". The Red Shirts have organized demonstrations in support of the Confederate flag, against the establishment of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, and against politicians they regard as \"scalawags\" and \"carpetbaggers\" such as Lindsey Graham, Bob Inglis and John McCain, and attorney Morris Dees. They supported the candidacy of John Cobin and conducted mock trials of Abraham Lincoln and William Tecumseh Sherman.\n\nAccording to their application for membership, Red Shirt goals include implementing \"God's laws as the acceptable standard of behavior\"; eliminating all federal \"control and influence in South Carolina\"; reducing the size and scope of government at all levels; and promoting and instituting \"Southern culture relying on Biblical truth\".\n\n\n\n"}

They have been held in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Saudi Arabia. A royal commission is similar in function to a commission of enquiry (or inquiry) found in other countries such as Ireland, South Africa, and regions such as Hong Kong. It has considerable powers, generally greater even than those of a judge but restricted to the terms of reference of the commission. The commission is created by the head of state (the sovereign, or his/her representative in the form of a governor-general or governor) on the advice of the government and formally appointed by letters patent. In practice—unlike lesser forms of inquiry—once a commission has started the government cannot stop it. Consequently, governments are usually very careful about framing the terms of reference and generally include in them a date by which the commission must finish.\n\nRoyal commissions are called to look into matters of great importance and usually controversy. These can be matters such as government structure, the treatment of minorities, events of considerable public concern or economic questions. Many royal commissions last many years and, often, a different government is left to respond to the findings. \n\nIn Australia—and particularly New South Wales—royal commissions have been investigations into police and government corruption and organised crime using the very broad coercive powers of the royal commissioner to defeat the protective systems that powerful, but corrupt, public officials had used to shield themselves from conventional investigation.\n\nRoyal commissions are usually chaired by one or more notable figures. Because of their quasi-judicial powers the commissioners are often retired or serving judges. They usually involve research into an issue, consultations with experts both within and outside government and public consultations as well. The warrant may grant immense investigatory powers, including summoning witnesses under oath, offering of indemnities, seizing of documents and other evidence (sometimes including those normally protected, such as classified information), holding hearings \"in camera\" if necessary and—in a few cases—compelling all government officials to aid in the execution of the Commission. The results of Royal Commissions are published in reports, often massive, of findings containing policy recommendations. (Due to the verbose nature of the titles of these formal documents – for example, the Royal commission into whether there has been corrupt or criminal conduct by any Western Australian Police Officer – they are commonly known by the name of the commission's chair.) While these reports are often quite influential, with the government enacting some or all recommendations into law, the work of some commissions have been almost completely ignored by the government. In other cases, where the commissioner has departed from the Warranted terms, the commission has been dissolved by a superior court.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "39104703", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39104703", "title": "Slavery in international law", "text": "Slavery in international law\n\nSlavery in international law is governed by a number of treaties, conventions and declarations. Foremost among these is the \"Universal Declaration on Human Rights\" (1948) that states in Article 4: “no one should be held in slavery or servitude, slavery in all of its forms should be eliminated.”\n\nProtection from slavery is reiterated in the Slavery Convention. This is affected by the Optional Protocol to the Abolition of Slavery and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). The ICCPR, governed by the Human Rights Committee, is responsible for internationally monitoring present conditions of slavery.\n\nAbolitionism has its roots in the 1807 Abolition of Slavery Act of Great Britain. Many academics in the field perceive this as the beginning of the end of the traditional form of slavery: chattel slavery. In the 19th century, Britain controlled the majority of the world through its colonies. Consequently, in passing this law to abolish slavery, the British Parliament abolished slavery in the vast majority of its colonies. \n\nCustomarily, freedoms from slavery can also be found prior to the 19th century under the phrase \"freedom from oppression and tyranny.\" Because slavery is a condition of complete and total submission of one person to another, often with the exertion of force or power of the owner over the submissive, the phrase \"freedom from oppression and tyranny\" accurately encompasses the right to freedom from slavery. \n\nThe United States Declaration of Independence, the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, the African Charter of Human Rights, and the Constitution of South Africa all present the idea that human beings should be free from tyranny and oppression. Although slavery continued to persist in some countries after these documents were written – namely, the United States, in which slavery continued until the adoption of the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865 – the underlying norm of this right is present. Through customary practice and the abolition of slavery, the international community has adopted the right of each person to be free from slavery.\n\nThe first large-scale move to abolish slavery by the international community came in 1926 with the Slavery Convention and again in 1957 when the Supplementary Convention came into power. The 1926 Slavery Convention provides the first international definition of slavery as:\n\nAlthough this document provides the concrete definition of slavery, its definition is limited in the types of slavery it includes. Instead, it is descriptive of chattel slavery, most commonly understood as the plantation slavery in the United States in the 18th and 19th centuries, even though chattel slavery was significantly more widespread and was not limited to one country alone. It is for this reason that the 1956 Supplementary Convention on Slavery was signed. It gives a more comprehensive definition of slavery to include debt bondage, serfdom, or any practice where a woman is promised or given into marriage on payment of money and is without the right to refuse the marriage, the husband of a woman has the right to transfer her to another person, a woman is liable to be inherited by another upon the death of her husband, or any practice where a child under 18 years of ages is exploited for his or her labour. The 1956 Supplementary Convention on Slavery came into force on April 30, 1957 and of 2002 there were 97 states partied to the convention.\n\nThe Slavery Convention and its supplementary document are beneficial in providing an international definition of slavery; however, there is no significant enforcement behind these documents. Both are declarations made by the collaboration of the international community, and agreements that signatories would modify their national laws in accordance with the convention, with the assistance of the United Nations if necessary; however, there are no consequences outlined in either document that provide incentive for signatories to abide by the convention\n\nThe Human Rights Committee is governed by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which entered into force on March 23, 1976. Article 8 of this Covenant states: “No one shall be held in slavery; slavery and the slave trade in all their forms shall be prohibited. No one shall be held in servitude. No one shall be required to perform force or compulsory labour.\" The ICCPR outlines, in part IV, the obligations of states to uphold the freedom from slavery. All states are required to submit regular reports to the Committee on how the rights of the Covenant are being implemented. A state’s initial report must be within one year of acceding the Covenant and after this, whenever the committee requests a report (usually every four years). In addition to the submission of reports, article 41 of the Covenant makes it possible for the Committee to consider inter-state complaints, and furthermore, the First Optional Protocol to the Covenant give the Committee the capacity investigate individual complaints with regards to violations of the Covenant by state parties.\n\nSince coming into force, the Human Rights Committee has commented on conditions of slavery in numerous countries and has provided these countries with recommendations as to how they should proceed to abolish slavery. In Mali, the committee noted that the State party has not taken clear action in response the reports of slavery like practices and hereditary servitude in the country. In acknowledging this, the committee recommended that the state should conduct research to determine if these conditions of slavery still exist, and if they do to take action. The committee also noted concerns of child trafficking into Côte d'Ivoire, where children were then being subjected to forced labour and slavery. In response to this phenomenon, the committee recommended that the Malian government take measures to prosecute the perpetrators of this traffic, and research more precise details regarding this situation for the committee analysis.\n\nThe committee observed situations of trafficking of human beings, namely women and children, in Serbia, and corresponding reports that the perpetrators of these acts were going unpunished. The committee recommended that the Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) in collaboration with the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government (PISG) should ensure that there is adequate investigation of these crimes and victims have access to lawyers, health care, and other forms of assistance.\n\nThe Human Rights Committee monitored trafficking in Norway. Here the committee recognizes that Norway has adopted the previous positive measures previously suggested; however, it notes that there are still reports of human trafficking, particularly women, and of female genital mutilation. The committee recommends further measures be taken to eradicate practices, as well as those to protect victims and witnesses.\n\nDebt bondage is the most common form of slavery today. It is a condition in which a person “pledges him or herself against a loan of money, but the length and nature of the service is undefined, and the labor does not diminish the original debt.” Debt bondage was included and defined as a form of slavery under the 1956 Supplementary Convention on Slavery. However, its many modern forms continue to include pawning, peonage, and worker debt. In India, debt bondage has been illegal since 1976; however, due to widespread poverty in the country, it continues to exist, as a man may need a loan to finance a wedding, funeral, medicine, fertilizer, or a fine. Because the interest rates on these debts as so high, debts are often inherited and children may replace their fathers or siblings. Debt bondage can also be incurred by specific industries – quarrying, carpet-making, agriculture, and fisheries – where the cost of equipment and supplies falls on the worker who needs a loan to pay for them.\n\nForced prostitution and sexual slavery are considered contemporary manifestations of this historical crime, and can be found anywhere in the world. Women are often entrapped by deceit or coercion with the promise of better life and remain entrapped by force or debt bondage. Forced marriage can also be considered a form of slavery, notably when the bride has no right or opportunity to refuse marriage. This form of marriage can also result out of a kidnapping of girls in order to sell them as brides, a widespread phenomena in China. Once married and raped, there girls are often kept under lock and key until they have a child, at which time they will be less likely to leave because they do not want to abandon their child.\n\nChild slavery is also considered a contemporary form of slavery, although its does come with debate as to what constitutes child slavery. However, child prostitution is widely considered a form of slavery in which children, mostly from South East Asia, South Asia, and Latin America, “are sold by their parents either because they are destitute, have too many mouths to feed, or are simply greedy”. On the other hand, in some cases of child prostitution, when parents give their children up to traffickers, they are deceived into believing that their child will earn good money, get an education, or learn a trade.\n\nForced labour can also be imposed by governments who “conscript their own subjects and put them to work for minimal, or no pay, and for varying lengths of time”. When imposed by governments, forced labour does not include military conscription or penal labour. Forced labour can, likewise, be used simply to cut production costs by private and public industries (e.g. cocoa plantations), or can be a form of involuntary servitude in the private sector – sweatshops. Bales refers to this type of slavery as contract slavery, where “contracts are offered which guarantee employment, perhaps in a workshop or factory, but when the workers are taken to their place of employment they discover that they have instead been taken into slavery...it is a way of making slavery seem legitimate and necessary”.\n\n"}

{"id": "51816809", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51816809", "title": "The Ford Heights Four", "text": "The Ford Heights Four\n\nThe Ford Heights Four (Verneal Jimerson, Dennis Williams, Kenneth Adams and Willie Rainge) were formerly imprisoned convicts, who were falsely accused and convicted of the double murder of Lawrence Lionberg and Carol Schmal in Ford Heights, Illinois and later exonerated. Jimerson and Williams were sentenced to death, Adams to 75 years in jail and Rainge to life. Following the murder in 1978, the four spent almost two decades in prison before being released in 1996. This miscarriage of justice was due to false forensic testimony, coercion of a prosecution witness, perjury by another witness who had an incentive to lie, and prosecution and police misconduct. The DNA evidence uncovered in the investigation to clear their names eventually lead to the arrest and conviction of the real killers.\n\nOn May 11, 1978, 28 year old Lawrence Lionberg (who was working a night shift at a Homewood, Illinois gas station) and his 23 year old fiancé Carol Schmal were kidnapped. Schmal was raped several times and both were shot in the back of the head. There was a public outcry at the brutal murder.\n\nThe four suspects were tried in 1978. A witness, Charles McCraney, claimed to have seen Williams, Rainge and Adams near the crime scene area in Ford Heights (at the time called East Chicago Heights) at the time of the crime. A state expert witness, Michael Podlecki, said that at least one of the rapists was type A secretor blood (shared by 25% of the population) and Williams and Adams had Type A secretor blood (an independent forensic witness found in 1987 that Williams and Adams actually had non-secretor blood). Podlecki also claimed that hairs from the back of Williams car were consistent with Lionberg and Schmal. No other physical evidence matched the suspects to the crime. A convict, David Jackson, testified that he had overheard Williams and Rainge in jail discussing the murder and rape (Jackson later admitted he had fabricated this evidence because he was offered a deal by the authorities). The prosecution eliminated all black jurors from the trial (the defendants were all black and the murder victims were white). The police did not inform the defense that a witness, Marvin Simpson, heard shots and identified four men running from the murder scene - Arthur Robinson, Juan Rodriguez, Ira and Dennis Johnson (these four were later found to be the real killers). Family members of the Ford Four testified they were elsewhere at the time of the murder. The defendants' lawyer, Archie B. Weston, was ineffective, was the subject of a legal disciplinary hearing at the time and was later disbarred from being a lawyer for another offense. A witness, Paula Gray, (with an IQ of 55), testified to prosecutors that she had seen the defendants shoot the victims and rape Schmal. However, she withdrew her evidence before the court case and prosecutors charged her with murder and perjury. Williams was sentenced to death, while Adams was sentenced to 75 years, Rainge to life, and Paula Gray to 50 years in 1978. Jimerson could not be charged as McCraney had not mentioned Jimerson in his testimony and Paula Gray had withdrawn her testimony.\n\nOn appeal, the Illinois supreme court reversed the convictions of Williams and Rainge in 1982 because the defendants lawyer was incompetent and was the subject of a legal disciplinary hearing. Prosecutors offered Paula Gray a deal to get out of jail if she testified she had seen Jimerson, Williams and Rainge shoot the victims and rape Schmal and she accepted. In 1985 McCraney had changed his evidence to include seeing Jimerson who was sentenced to death. In 1987 Williams was sentenced to death and Rainge to life at a retrial. Paula Gray was released from prison in 1987.\n\nThree female students, including Laura Sullivan who is now an award-winning investigative correspondent for NPR, working under Professor David Protess of the Northwestern University Medill School of Journalism investigated this case and found the Marvin Simpson witness statement testifying seeing Robinson, Rodriguez, Ira and Dennis Johnson fleeing from the murder scene. Jackson and Paula Gray recanted their evidence. The students also got DNA tests done which showed Jimerson, Williams, Adams and Rainge were innocent and, eventually, that Robinson, Rodriguez, Ira and Dennis Johnson were guilty and three of them confessed (Dennis Johnson had died by then). The Ford Heights Four were exonerated and freed in 1996.\n\nThe Ford Heights Four received $36 million in 1999 in civil rights damages from Cook County - the largest settlement in US history at the time.\n\nGeorge Ryan the Governor of Illinois, declared a moratorium on the state's death penalty in 2000 citing the Ford Heights Four as one example of men who would have been executed if it had not been for the unpaid work of the Northwestern University journalism professors and students.\n\n\n"}

Based on the terms of the treaty, the two countries agreed to define the border of their respective colonies on the island of Santo Domingo in the Caribbean Sea which they shared ownership of. Spain made substantial gains in the upper Artibonite Valley in middle section of the island. The new border was to be marked by border stones. It was signed at Aranjuez Palace near Madrid in Spain. It was one of a number of diplomatic agreements signed at the palace in the eighteenth century and should not be confused with the 1779 Treaty of Aranjuez between the two states which led to Spain's entry into the American War of Independence.\n\nThe northernmost and southernmost part of the international border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic still conforms to the boundaries between French and Spanish colonies agreed to in the Treaty of Aranjuez. However, in the 20th century, the middle portion of the boundary was changed to make it closer to a straight north–south line and thereby transferred a large portion of Hispaniola from the Dominican Republic to Haiti. An original boundary stone is on display in the Museo de las Casas Reales, Santo Domingo.\n\n\n"}

It is paired with and referred to collectively as . It is managed by Hello Work.\n\nJapanese unemployment insurance is closer to the US or Canadian \"user pays\" system than the taxpayer funded systems in place in countries such as the United Kingdom, New Zealand, or Australia. It is paid for by contributions by both the employer and employee.\n\nWorkers enrolling in unemployment insurance must be working at least 20 hours per week, and to expect to be employed for at least 31 days. Employees who are dispatched to Japan from overseas and who already have coverage in a similar scheme are not required to enroll in Japanese unemployment insurance.\n\nOn leaving a job, employees are supposed to be given a \"Rishoku-hyo\" document showing their ID number (the same number is supposed to be used by later employers), employment periods, and pay (which contributions are linked to). The reason for leaving is also documented separately.\n\nPremiums are calculated as a certain percentage of each worker's total wage. Under the latest revision in April 2016, the insurance premium rate is 1.10% (the employer paying 0.7% and the worker paying 0.4%) with the exception of a few kinds of jobs.\n\nThe circumstances under which an employee left their position affect eligibility, timing, and amount of benefits. The length of time that unemployed workers can receive benefits depends on the age of the employee, and how long they have been employed and paying in.\n\nIt is supposed to be compulsory for most full-time employees. If they have been enrolled for at least six months and are fired or made redundant, leave the company at the end of their contract, or their contract is non-renewed, the now-unemployed worker will receive unemployment insurance. If a worker quit of their own accord they may have to wait between one and three months before receiving any payment.\n\nIn July 2016 Japan's unemployment rate was 3%. Japan's unemployment rate has remained relatively low over the years. However July 2016 set the record low in twenty-one years. Despite this recent record low unemployment, Japan has record high job availability. Japan's unemployment rate might fall even lower based on their job availability. Japan's welfare state utilizes an egalitarian principle designed at providing equal aid to all individuals. This style facilitates maintaining low unemployment percentage, high job availability percentage, and a growing economy. Although unemployment rates are dynamic there are many intervening variables correlating to its growth or decline.\n\n"}

It remains in force in England and Wales, and anyone found to be sleeping in a public place or to be trying to beg for money can be arrested.\n\nContemporary critics, including William Wilberforce, condemned the Act for being a catch-all offence because it did not consider the circumstances as to why an individual might be placed in such a predicament.\n\nThe law was enacted to deal with the increasing numbers of homeless and penniless urban poor in England and Wales following the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. Nine years after the Battle of Waterloo the British Army and British Navy had undergone a massive reduction in size, leaving large numbers of discharged military personnel without jobs or accommodation. Many were living rough on the streets or in makeshift camps. At the same time a massive influx of economic migrants from Ireland and Scotland arrived in England, especially London, in search of work. Politicians in the unreformed House of Commons became concerned that parish constables were becoming ineffective in controlling these \"vagrants\". Further, the medieval pass laws which gave itinerant travelling people free movement through a given district were considered to be no longer effective.\n\nPunishment for the wide definition of vagrancy (including prostitution) was up to one month's hard labour. \n\nThe Act of 1824 was amended several times, most notably by the Vagrancy Act 1838, which introduced a number of new public order offences covering acts that were deemed at the time to be likely to cause moral outrage. It contained a provision for the prosecution of \"every Person wilfully exposing to view, in any Street... or public Place, any obscene Print, Picture, or other indecent Exhibition\". \n\nAlthough the Act of 1824 originally applied only to England and Wales, Section 4 of the Act, which dealt mainly with vagrancy and begging, was extended to Scotland and Ireland by section 15 of the Prevention of Crimes Act 1871.\n\nThe Vagrancy Act 1898 prohibited soliciting or importuning for immoral purposes. Originally intended as a measure against prostitution, in practice the legislation was almost solely used to convict men for gay sex.\n\nThe Criminal Law Amendment Act 1912, extended provisions of the 1824 Act to Scotland and Ireland, and gave further protection to women and girls through the suppression of brothels.\n\nCertain sections of the original Vagrancy Act 1824 remain in force in England and Wales. However ss.3 and 4 were repealed by Vagrancy Offences (Repeal) Act 1981, effectively legalising or decriminalising 'begging' in all circumstances. In 1982 the entire Act was repealed in Scotland by the Civic Government (Scotland) Act. Section 18 of the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990 (Ireland) repealed section 4 of the 1824 Act (begging and vagrancy) in Ireland.\n\nUnder the Act discharged military personnel continue to be granted exemption certificates allowing them to appeal for alms under certain circumstances.\n\nIn 1988 some 573 people were prosecuted and convicted under the Act in England and Wales. In May 1990 the National Association of Probation Officers carried out a survey of prosecutions under the Act. That survey revealed that 1,250 prosecutions had been dealt with in 14 magistrates courts in Central London in 1988, which represented an enormous leap in the number of prosecutions under the Act, especially in London.\n\nIn 2014 three men were arrested and charged under Section 4 of the 1824 Vagrancy Act for stealing food that had been put in skips and bins outside an Iceland supermarket in Kentish Town, North London. Paul May, William James and Jason Chan were due to stand trial after allegedly taking cheese, tomatoes and cakes worth £33 from bins behind the shop. The Iceland chain denied any involvement in contacting the police, and in a public statement it questioned why the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) felt that it was in the public interest to pursue a case against the three individuals.\nThe three men, all of no fixed address, were due to attend a hearing at Highbury Magistrates' Court on 3 February 2014. However, before that date the CPS announced its decision to drop the case, stating that it felt it had not given due weight to the public interest factors tending against prosecution.\n\n"}
