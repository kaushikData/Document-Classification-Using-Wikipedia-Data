These killings were documented in aerial surveys conducted from May through August 2006 and total at least 100 animals. This region has a four decade history of illegal killing of this species; in fact, the Chad population was over 300,000 animals as recently as 1970 and has been reduced to approximately 10,000 as of 2006. The African elephant nominally has Chadian governmental protection, but the implementation practices of the government (backed with certain EU help) have been insufficient to stem the slaughter by poachers. The species African Bush Elephant (\"Loxodonta africana\") occurs in several countries of Eastern Africa.\n\nThe most recent aerial surveys were conducted from August 3–11, 2006, overseen by J. Michael Fay, a Wildlife Conservation Society conservationist and National Geographic explorer-in-residence. They found five separate massacre sites. Zakouma is considered \"one of the last bastions of wildlife in all of central Africa\". Commissioned by the government of Chad and Project CRUSSE (Conservation and Rational Utilization of Sudan-Sahelian Ecosystems), Fay conducted surveys In 2005 and 2006 of elephants within Zakouma, and found populations to decline from 3885 to 3020 animals, significantly offsetting the precipitous increase of the previous six months, although the counting error could not be fully assessed.\n\nFay reported that he saw five men at a base camp, who ran when his airplane approached. At another time he saw one man on horseback with an automatic weapon, who fired on his airplane. \"Zakouma elephants are getting massacred right before our eyes.\", Fay relayed to reporters. \"We hadn't been in the air more than two hours when we saw our first carcass. It was fresh, maybe just a few weeks old, not far from the park headquarters, and the animal's face had been chopped off, the tusks removed.\" Fay and National Geographic photographer Michael Nichols documented what they found in Ivory Wars, Last Stand in Zakouma.\n\nZakouma National Park is located between Sarh and Am Timan, in the southeastern part of Chad. Created in 1963, it was Chad's first national park, and has an area of almost 3000 square kilometres. It is entirely surrounded by the Bahr Salamat Faunal Reserve. Zakouma was neglected during the period of civil conflict, but a restoration programme, supported by the European Union, began in 1989 and is continuing in 2006.\n\nElephants within the park have protection from the Chadian government, but the elephants who migrate outside Zakouma to forage in the rainy season, are not subject to the same patrol protection as within the park. According to Stephen Sautner of the Wildlife Conservation Society: \"All hunting of elephants in Chad is illegal, and the sale of ivory has been banned since 1989, though black-market trade is increasing.\"\n\nKilling elephants for ivory has been a major cause of the decline of the African elephant population since at least the 1970s. Most of the ivory harvested is imported into China and Thailand. For example, between 1996 and 2002 forty-five tonnes of ivory in transit to China were seized by authorities. China agreed to reduce imports of ivory; however a Chinese official Chen Jianwei has indicated that many Chinese people are confused about the legality of ivory imports.\n\nZakouma is about 260 kilometres west of the conflict area of Darfur, and is in the path of recent warfare in Chad, thus overall security is low and the national border is \"porous in this isolated region.\"\n\nIn response to this devastating event, The WILD Foundation partnered with The Wildlife Conservation Society and others to deter and detain poachers using aircraft surveillance. The aircraft will focus on park borders, where elephants are not protected. Learn more about this rapid response conservation effort\n\n\n"}

Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.\n\nNo specific right of access to information was enshrined in the 1982 Turkish Constitution that in Article 26 instead refers to the right of free expression, including the \"right to receive information\". In the 2001 amended Constitution, Article 74 specifically refers to the right to information establishing that everyone has the right to obtain information. Following the 2010 Constitutional amendments, the right to appeal to the Ombudsperson is also provided.\nAccess to public information is regulated by the Law on the Right to Information, Law No: 4982 of 2004. The law was introduced in the framework of the negotiations for accession to the European Union.\n\nOn September 21, 2016, the Open Government Partnership (OGP) Steering Committee designated the inactive status of Turkey with regard to the OGP action plan which included, among other objectives, an improvement of the possibility to access public information for Turkish citizens. The Steering Committee found that the Turkish government acted contrary to OGP process for two consecutive action plan cycles.\n\nIn addition to Law No: 4982, in 2004 a circular by the Prime Minister on “The exercise of the right of petition and access to information” was also enacted (Circular No. 25356). It identifies the basis of this policy in the principle called “citizen oriented approach in public services”.\n\nAccording to Law No: 4982, the law applies to any natural and legal person who are entitled to apply to the institutions by way of exercising the right to information. Foreign residents can exercise the right “on the condition that the information that they require is related to them or the field of their activities and on the basis of the principle of reciprocity”.\n\nThe law applies to “any written, printed or copied file, document, book, journal, brochure, etude, letter, software, instruction, sketch, plan, film, photograph, tape and video cassette, map of the institutions and the information, news and other data that are recorded and saved in electronic format that are within the scope of (the) law”.\n\nGovernment bodies are required to respond in 15 working days. They must provide either a certified copy of the document or when it is not possible to make a copy, applicants can examine them at the institution.\n\nInitially, the Right to Information Assessment (Review) Council (\"Bilgi Edinme Değerlendirme Kurulu\"- BEDK) provided very poor information about its activities and decisions. It started to publish all information on its decision only in 2008 with the launch of its website. The BEDK jurisdiction on appeals for denials to requests of information was originally limited to cases relating to national security and state economic interests. In November 2005, the Law was amended in order to allow any kind of appeal. According to the 2016 EC progress report, the Board of Review of Access to Information was effective in its role of reviewing applicants' appeals and in publishing related decisions online. The report also notes that, however, there is no quality assurance in the responses given to applicants.\n\nAccording to Decision No. 2016/1 of August 4, 2016 on “Applications for Information on Measures and Transactions within the Context of Emergency State Decentralization Laws”, the applicants who ask for information and documents relating with (i) persons who are removed from the public service and (ii) institutions and organizations which are closed down under the Decree Laws in the State of Emergency Law, are excluded from the scope of the right to obtain information.\n\nAccording to the 2016 European Commission (EC) Progress Report on Turkey, the Law on access to public information is not fully aligned with international standards. Another problem highlighted by the EC is the failure to adopt pending legislation on state and trade secrets, which prevents to balance between confidentiality and transparency when assessing freedom of information requests.\n\nUnder Articles No. 20- 28 of Law No. 4982, the right to information can be restricted if such information refers to:\n\nIn practice, protection of state secrets, commercial secrets and privacy were among the most common grounds for rejecting a request. According to an expert, all these conditions largely nullify the legal provisions which are intended to protect the right to public information in Turkey.\n\nThe exercise of the right of access to public information is particularly problematic in the Turkish context, where the management of public affairs is characterized by a secretive approach to power and politics, and several problems affect the exercise of the right of free expression and media freedom. The situation has been deteriorating with the state of exception following the attempted coupt of July 15, 2016, entailing severe limitations to media freedom and to dissemination of information, press freedom limitations, sanctions against newspapers and journalists, censorship and self-censorship.\n\nA right to information request can be made using the BIMER website (\"Başbakanlık İletişim Merkezi\"), active since 2006.\n\nIn 2014, only 2,7% of requests for access to information were rejected, against 3,4% in 2013. The share of appeals refused by the Board of Review of the Access to Information fell from 50,6% in 2013 to 36,3% in 2014. According to the European Commission, more than 2 million applications a year for access to information were submitted both in 2015 and 2016. The percentage of requests refused remained small, approximately 3.7% up to June 2016 compared with 3% in 2015.\n\nRegarding the right to access information for lawyers, especially when they are assisting defendants accused with terrorism charges, they face serious problems. Their access to documents pertaining to the case can be restricted before the trial.\n\nOn September 21, 2016, the Steering Committee of the Open Government Partnership (OGP) designated the inactive status of Turkey, for acting contrary to OGP process for two consecutive action plan cycles. The OGP action plan included, among other objectives, an improvement of the possibility to access public information for Turkish citizens. The decision follows a resolution approved unanimously by the OGP Steering Committee during their May 4, 2016 ministerial level meeting in Cape Town, South Africa. That resolution called for the government of Turkey to take steps to re-engage in OGP, including the development of a National Action with broad civil society participation by September 1, 2016.\n\n\n"}

One application in which it may be useful is in Mobile ad hoc networking (MANET). \n\nAdaptive QoS routing is a cross-layer optimization adaptive routing mechanism. The cross-layer mechanism provides up-to-date local QoS information for the adaptive routing algorithm, by considering the impacts of node mobility and lower-layer link performance. The multiple QoS requirements are satisfied by adaptively using forward error correction and multipath routing mechanisms, based on the current network status. The complete routing mechanism includes three parts: (1) a modified dynamic source routing algorithm that handles route discovery and the collection of QoS related parameters; (2) a local statistical computation and link monitoring function located in each node; and (3) an integrated\ndecision-making system to calculate the number of routing paths, coding parity length, and traffic distribution rates. \n\nA wireless ad hoc network consists of a collection of mobile nodes interconnected by multihop wireless paths with wireless transmitters and receivers. Such networks can be spontaneously created and operated in a self-organized manner, because they do not rely upon any preexisting network infrastructure.\n\nThe emergence of multimedia applications in communications has generated the need to provide\nmobile quality-of-service (QoS) support in ad hoc networks, and such applications require a stable path to guarantee QoS requirements. However, the topology of ad hoc networks is highly dynamic due to the unpredictable node mobility. In addition, wireless channel bandwidth is limited. So, QoS provisioning in such networks is complex and challenging.\n\nQoS routing usually involves two tasks: collecting and maintaining up-to-date state information about the network and finding feasible paths for a connection based on its QoS requirements. Many approaches currently exist to perform QoS routing, most of which consist of routing across the Network layer of the OSI model only. Some approaches utilize both the Network and Data link layer but do not consider the cross layer behaviors. This makes quantifying the QoS parameters difficult and leads to considerations of QoS but does not guarantee QoS. \n\nTo address this problem, appropriate cross-layer cooperation is required. Adaptive QoS schemes provide QoS information by factoring the impacts of node mobility and lower-layer link parameters into QoS performance. \n\nMost QoS approaches tend to focus on only one QoS parameter (e.g., packet loss, end-to-end delay, and bandwidth). For example, while many of the QoS-related schemes are successful in reducing packet loss by adding redundancy in the packet, they do this at the expense of end-to-end delay. Because packet loss and end-to-end delay are inversely related, it may not be possible to find a path that simultaneously satisfies the delay, packet loss, and bandwidth constraints. Some proposed QoS routing algorithms do consider multiple metrics, but without considering cross-layer cooperation. Multipath routing is another type of QoS routing that has received much attention, since it can provide load balancing, fault tolerance, and higher aggregate bandwidth. Although this approach decreases packet loss and end-to-end delay, it is only efficient and reliable if a relationship can be found between the number of paths and QoS constraints.\n\nTo implement an adaptive multipath routing scheme, three functions distributed in different parts of the network are needed. First, a modified dynamic source routing function is needed. It handles route discovery and collecting the local QoS-related information along the selected\nroutes. Second, there is a local statistical computation and link monitoring function located in each node. This function is used to support the above routing function. It will manage\nand build the local routing information in each node, which includes a QoS-related table. The third function will be in charge of the final decision-making process. The adaptive\nrouting parameters are derived from the decision-making algorithm based on the QoS constraints. They are the number N of selected paths, parity length k of the FEC, code and the set {R} of the traffic distribution rates on each path. With these functions, adaptive multipath QoS routing is implemented.\n\nQoS requirements can be based on either a delay or a delay and bandwidth requirement, or a packet loss requirement. FEC parity length is derived from the difference between the QoS\ndelay requirement and the average delay on selected paths under the packet-loss constraint. Average packet loss under this FEC scheme is achieved by using multiple routing paths.\nAt the same time, the packet distribution rate on each path is determined under fair packet-loss and load-balance principles. Routing maintenance under the same QoS guarantees\nis achieved without increasing its computational complexity.This required to be understand.\n\nThree functions (routing function, local statistic computation and monitoring function, and integrated decisionmaking function) are implemented in the different parts of the mobile network. Due to the distributed structure, the computation and implementation complexity of the\nrouting scheme are reduced. Also, since routes are discovered based on the up-to-date local information and selected by the optimization computation, routing parameters (e.g., number of paths, FEC parity length, and traffic distribution rate) are dynamic and optimized. In addition\nto supporting multiple QoS requirements, traffic balancing and bandwidth resources are factored into our decisionmaking process. The distributed structure of the local QoS statistics used in the routing enables this QoS support mechanism to be scalable in mobile networks. Simulation\nresults indicate that the performance (i.e., packet loss and end-to-end delay) are much better and less susceptible to the state changes (i.e., node mobility, transmission power, channel characteristics, and the traffic pattern) of the network, compared to a nonadaptive routing strategy.\n\n\nAdaptive QoS Routing by Cross-Layer Cooperation in Ad Hoc Networks Hongxia Sun & Herman Hughes, EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking May 2005, Adaptive QoS Routing\n"}

The Code's Article 156(a) targets those who deliberately, in public, express feelings of hostility, hatred, or contempt against religions with the purpose of preventing others from adhering to any religion, and targets those who disgrace a religion. The penalty for violating Article 156(a) is a maximum of five years' imprisonment.\n\nArticle 156(a) is the complement to a decree enacted by President Sukarno and implemented by President Soeharto, namely, Presidential Decree No. 1/PNPS/1965 on the Prevention of Blasphemy and Abuse of Religions. Article 1 of the decree prohibits the \"deviant interpretation\" of religious teachings, and mandates the President to dissolve any organisation practicing deviant teachings. Until the end of the 20th century, Indonesian society was tolerant of Islam (88% of the population), Roman Catholicism, Protestantism, Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism, Judaism, and animism. The Government was tolerant of persons with no religion, but does not count them in any census.\n\nArticle 29 of Indonesia's Constitution stipulates \"the state is based on the belief in the one supreme God.\" The Constitution does not dictate which religion's version of God should be worshipped. In January 2006, the Ministry of Religious Affairs accorded official status to six religions: Islam, Catholicism, Protestantism, Buddhism, Hinduism and Confucianism. On 9 December 2006, the House of Representatives passed a new civil registration bill requiring citizens to identify themselves on government ID cards as a member of one of the six religions.\n\nThe Government formed a body of Muslim advisors, the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) in 1975, and continues to fund and appoint its members. The MUI is not formally a government body but it is influential. The Government considers the MUI's \"fatawa\" when making decisions or drafting legislation. In July 2005, the MUI issued a fatwa that condemned the sect of Ahmadiyya as a heresy. In June 2008, the Ministry of Religious Affairs and the Home Ministry issued a Joint Ministerial Letter regarding the Ahmadiyya. The letter told authorities to restrict Ahmadiyya activities to private worship, and to prevent the Amadhi Muslims from proselytising. Provincial governors in West Sumatra, South Sumatra, and West Nusa Tenggara banned all Ahmadiyya activity.\n\nIndonesia's laws and policies have produced many instances where members of one religion have persecuted the members of other religions or of other sects. The authorities have not brought to justice many perpetrators of crimes. Crimes are commonly justified by the perpetrators as actions against hatred, heresy, blasphemy, or deviance.\n\nIn October 2009, a group of petitioners, including some human rights groups, requested that Indonesia's Constitutional Court review the 1965 Law on Blasphemy. On 19 April 2010, the Court announced its refusal to make the review. \"If the Blasphemy Law was scrapped before a new law was enacted ... it was feared that misuses and contempt of religion would occur and trigger conflicts in society,\" Justice Akil Mochtar said. The Court offered an interpretation of the Law. The interpretation says the state recognises six religions, and \"leaves alone\" the followers of other religions.\n\n\n"}

Atlantic Cement Co., was a New York court case in which New York's highest court considered whether permanent damages were an appropriate remedy in lieu of a permanent injunction. The case was one of the first and most influential instances of a court applying permanent damages. It is widely referenced in law and economics research and case law.\n\nLand owners with property adjacent to a cement plant had sued, alleging that dirt, smoke and vibration issuing from it constituted nuisance. The trial court agreed and awarded damages, but rejected the request for an injunction to cut off the problem.\n\nOn appeal, the court observed that ordinarily, \"where a nuisance has been found and where there has been any substantial damage shown by the party complaining, an injunction will be granted.\" Following that path would result in closing the plant, however, and the court sought to avoid that \"drastic remedy.\" Instead, it engaged in a cost-balancing analysis, contrasting the trial court's finding that the total permanent damages done to all plaintiffs was $185,000 with Atlantic Cement's investment in the plant (upwards of $45,000,000) and more than 350 jobs at stake. \"The parties could settle this private litigation at any time if defendant paid enough money and the imminent threat of closing the plant would build up the pressure on defendant,\" the court observed:\n\n[G]rant[ing] the injunction unless defendant pays plaintiffs such permanent damages as may be fixed by the court seems to do justice between the contending parties. All of the attributions of economic loss to the properties on which plaintiffs' complaints are based will have been redressed ... [and i]t seems reasonable to think that the risk of being required to pay permanent damages to injured property owners by cement plant owners would itself be a reasonably effective spur to research for improved techniques to minimize nuisance.\n\nThe judges also discussed the concept of “servitude on land.” Servitude, in property law, ties rights and obligations to ownership of land so that they run with the land to successive owners. The majority described the damage imposed by the cement plant as a servitude on the land. They claimed that payment of permanent damages would constitute full compensation for the servitude placed on the land. The dissenting opinion posited that imposing a servitude on land where the impairment continues for a private use is unconstitutional. The author cited the state constitution—“private property shall not be taken for public use”—remarking that it does not mention private use and concluding that “the permanent impairment of private property for private purposes is not authorized in the absence of clearly demonstrated public benefit.” However, the majority's interpretation of the damage placed on the land by the nuisance held.\n\nThe trial court was ordered \"to grant an injunction which shall be vacated upon payment by defendant of ... permanent damage[s] to the respective plaintiffs.\"\n\nThe case is often cited as an illustration of the law and economics approach in nuisance law and property law. The court granted an injunction against the cement plant for nuisance, but permitted the plant to pay permanent damages after which the court would vacate the injunction. In essence, the court permitted the plant to pay the net present value of its effects and to continue polluting.\n"}

Most of the emphasis of bankruptcy law in the British Virgin Islands relates to corporate insolvency rather than personal bankruptcy. As an offshore financial centre, the British Virgin Islands has many times more resident companies than citizens, and accordingly the courts spend more time dealing with corporate insolvency and reorganisation.\n\nThe Insolvency Act largely eschews the rescue culture and emphasises the protection of creditors' rights (and in particular secured creditors' rights) over other stakeholders in a bankruptcy and the rehabilitation and protection of businesses as a going concern. This reflects the large number of structured finance vehicles incorporated in the jurisdiction which employ leveraged finance, but do not otherwise trade or have any employees.\n\nBankruptcy of individuals is usually referred to as \"personal bankruptcy\" in the British Virgin Islands, whereas the bankruptcy of corporations is referred to as \"corporate insolvency\". The legislation largely deals with both separately, although there are some common provisions.\n\nPrior to the Insolvency Act coming into force on 1 January 2004, bankruptcy legislation in the British Virgin Islands was divided between the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 8) and the Companies Act (Cap 285). The previous legislation was largely piecemeal, and eventually resulted in a comprehensive review which led to the enactment of the 2003 statute.\n\nAfter the coming into force of the Insolvency Act 2003 (and the repeal of earlier legislation) the country had to wait nearly 18 months for the Insolvency Rules 2005 to come into force. In practice this meant that no bankruptcies were possible, because the delegation of certain key provisions, including the particulars of preferred creditors, were deferred to the rules.\n\nWhere an individual is unable to pay or provide for his debts he may be placed in bankruptcy by an order of the court.\n\nA court in the British Virgin Islands may make a bankruptcy order against an individual if:\n\nIn order to make an application for an order it is necessary to show that on the date of the application the debtor was:\n\nOnce appointed pursuant to an order the trustee in bankruptcy will collect in the assets of the debtor except for certain special assets protected by law, sell those assets and then distribute the proceeds to the creditors of the bankrupt \"pari passu\". That distribution discharges the claims of the creditors against the bankrupt individual, and all other creditors who would have claimed in the bankruptcy. The individual is thereafter discharged from bankruptcy.\n\nWhere a company is unable to pay or provide for its debts it may be placed in liquidation either voluntary by a resolution of members or compulsorily by an order of the court. British Virgin Islands law uses the phrase \"in liquidation\" in preference to the term \"winding-up\" used in other jurisdictions.\n\nA company is treated as insolvent, and liable to have a liquidator appointed if:\n\nLiquidation is a class right, and so the court will not make an order if it is opposed by a majority of creditors.\n\nOnce a liquidator is appointed, his duty to is collect in all of the assets of the company, liquidate them and pay or provide for the claims of the company's creditors \"pari passu\". Once a liquidator is appointed, creditors may not commence or continue legal proceedings against the company.\n\nAt the conclusion of the liquidation the company is dissolved.\n\nWhere the assets of the company are in jeopardy, or where the company has engaged in misconduct, it is possible to seek the appointment of a provisional liquidator.\n\nFor both individual and creditors, where any creditor also owes money a company or an individual who goes into liquidation or bankruptcy, then upon the making of the order the sums due between the parties are set-off so that only a net sum due is owed either to the creditor or the insolvent party. However, the benefit of that provision can be waived by the creditor so long as any waiver does not operate to the prejudice of other creditors. Where a person has actual notice of the insolvency of another party at the time they extended credit, they cannot set-off any obligations owed if that other party subsequently goes into bankruptcy.\n\nCreditors of a person are entitled to enter into subordination agreement to reorder the priority of claims against an insolvent party upon the bankruptcy of that party.\n\nThe Insolvency Act has incorporated ISDA Model Netting legislation (pre-2007 form) and so any netting agreement relating to financial contracts will prevail over the statutory insolvency set-off provisions. Financial contracts for these purposes are defined in some detail in the Insolvency Rules.\n\nThe Insolvency Act is \"predicated heavily towards the protection of secured creditors' rights\". Secured creditors are not ordinarily subject to the usual stays and delays on creditors' rights when enforcing a valid security interest.\n\nSimilarly, provisions such as creditors' arrangements and recognition of foreign insolvency representatives are circumscribed to the extent that they interfere with the rights of secured creditors.\n\nAlthough the Insolvency Act does not focus on rehabilitation of financially distressed companies, the legislation does contain various provisions for corporate rescue.\n\nPart II of the Insolvency Act provides for creditors' arrangements, whereby the creditors of an individual or a company may, by a 75% vote, approve an arrangement which may enable the company to continue trading. This is subject to the rights of the secured and preferred creditors.\n\nPart III of the Insolvency Act deals with administration orders, designed to enable a trading company to have breathing space to deal with its creditors. If a company had granted a floating charge the court may not make an administration order without the consent of the holder.\n\nA company may also enter into a scheme of arrangement whereby a compromise between the company and its creditors may be sanctioned by the court if approved by 75% in value and a majority in number of the company's creditors.\n\nFor both personal and corporate bankruptcy, the Insolvency Act provides that certain transactions entered into in the \"twilight\" period prior to bankruptcy may be challenged by a liquidator by application to the court.\n\nIn each case (except for extortionate credit) the bankrupt must have either been insolvent at the time of entering into the transaction or the transaction must have caused them to become insolvent.\n\nThe relevant vulnerability period is the period prior to the commencement of liquidation (for companies) or the presentation of a petition for a bankruptcy order (in the case of individuals). The vulnerability period is extended for transactions involving persons who are connected persons to the bankrupt.\n\nThe voidable transactions regime contains certain provisions designed to protect bona fide attempts to provide credit to financially distressed companies and individuals. These provisions are presumed not to apply to transactions involving connected persons.\n\nInsolvency practitioners are required to be licensed in the British Virgin Islands in order to act as a liquidator, administrator, administrative receiver or supervisor of a creditors' arrangement. A foreign insolvency practitioner may act jointly with a licensed insolvency practitioner provided that (a) the Financial Services Commission has been notified in advance of the proposed appointment in writing and has not objected within the statutory time limit.\n\nMost corporate insolvencies in the British Virgin Islands involve a cross border element. The Insolvency Act contains two parts dealing with cross-border insolvency. Part XVIII is based upon the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency, The provisions do not sit easily within the remaining structure of the Insolvency Act as they are predicated on the centre of main interest (or \"COMI\") concept, which is otherwise unknown under British Virgin Islands law, and that Part has not yet been brought into force. Part XIX deals with orders in aid of foreign insolvency proceedings. Those provisions have been utilised by the British Virgin Islands courts on a number of occasions, including most notably recognising and assisting Irving Picard in the British Virgin Islands during the Madoff investment scandal.\n\n"}

{"id": "647856", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=647856", "title": "Exclusion Crisis", "text": "Exclusion Crisis\n\nThe Exclusion Crisis ran from 1679 through 1681 in the reign of King Charles II of England, Scotland and Ireland. Three Exclusion bills sought to exclude the King's brother and heir presumptive, James, Duke of York, from the thrones of England, Scotland and Ireland because he was Roman Catholic. None became law. Two new parties formed. The Tories were opposed to this exclusion while the \"Country Party\", who were soon to be called the Whigs, supported it.\nIn 1673, when he refused to take the oath prescribed by the new Test Act, it became publicly known that the Duke of York was a Roman Catholic. His secretary, Edward Colman, had been named by Titus Oates during the Popish Plot (1678) as a conspirator to subvert the kingdom. Members of the Anglican English establishment could see that in France a Catholic king was ruling in an absolutist way, and a movement gathered strength to avoid such a form of monarchy from developing in England, as many feared it would if James were to succeed his brother Charles, who had no legitimate children. Sir Henry Capel summarised the general feeling of the country when he said in a parliamentary debate in the House of Commons of England on 27 April 1679:\nThe occasion which brought these sentiments to a head was the impeachment of Thomas Osborne, Earl of Danby, as a scapegoat for a scandal by which Louis XIV bought the neutrality of Charles's government with an outright bribe. Charles dissolved the Cavalier Parliament, but the new Parliament which assembled on 6 March 1679 was even more hostile to the king and to his unfortunate minister, thus Danby was committed to the Tower of London.\n\nOn 15 May 1679, the supporters of Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, introduced the Exclusion bill in the Commons with the intention of excluding James from the succession to the throne. A fringe group there began to support the claim to the throne of Charles's illegitimate – but Protestant – son, the Duke of Monmouth. As it seemed likely that the bill would pass in the House of Commons, Charles exercised his royal prerogative to dissolve Parliament again. Successive Parliaments attempted to pass such a bill, and were likewise dissolved.\nWhile it should be treated with caution, the Exclusion Crisis is often identified as the point at which discernible political parties first emerged in England. Those who supported petitions asking Charles to recall Parliament and complete the passage of the Exclusion Bill were known as 'Petitioners' and later became Whigs. Those who opposed the Bill or so-called Abhorrers developed into the Tories.\n\nThe nature of politics in this period is illustrated by the fact that Shaftesbury, who opposed James due to his similarities to the absolutist Catholic French regime was supported financially by Louis XIV of France who saw benefit in deepening English internal divisions. The Popish Plot was used by the Whigs to mobilise support but moderates grew increasingly concerned by the hysteria it generated which caused the execution of 22 'conspirators' and accused the Queen of conspiring to poison her husband. Many of Shaftesbury's supporters like the Earl of Huntingdon now switched sides and after two failed attempts to pass the Bill, Charles succeeded in labelling the Whigs as subversives. Louis now switched financial support to Charles, allowing him to dissolve the 1681 Oxford Parliament. It was not called again during his reign, depriving the Whigs of their main source of political support, i.e., government patronage; the failed 1683 Rye House Plot then completed their isolation.\n\nOne long-lasting result of the crisis was the codification of the writ of Habeas Corpus: the one concrete achievement of the short-lived Habeas Corpus Parliament of 1679 before it was dissolved. In passing this act, the Whig leaders were concerned for their own persons, apprehensive (correctly) that the King would try to move against them through the courts. But the act far outlived the specific crisis, having long-term implications for the British legal system (and later, the American one).\n\nRobert Neill's 1972 historical novel \"The Golden Days\" depicts the Exclusion Crisis as experienced by two Members of Parliament representing a rural constituency. Sir Harry Burnaby is a staunch Royalist who had been knighted for having helped Charles II's Restoration; his neighbor and fellow MP is Richard Gibson, an ex-Colonel in Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army, and an outspoken member of the Green Ribbon Club and of the emerging Whig party. Despite their sharp political differences, Burnaby and Gibson come to deeply respect each other, and they share the anxiety lest the unfolding crisis escalate beyond control and England be plunged again into all-out civil war. Eventually, Burnaby's son marries Gibson's daughter, with the full blessing of both fathers.\n\n"}

Such claims are not recognized by any authority, and have no legal standing. Nevertheless, some private individuals and organizations have claimed ownership of celestial bodies, such as the Moon, and are actively involved in \"selling\" parts of them through certificates of ownership termed \"Lunar deeds\", \"Martian deeds\" or similar.\n\nThe topic of real estate on celestial objects has been present since the 1890s. Dean Lindsay made claims for all extraterrestrial objects on June 15, 1936. The public sent offers to buy objects from him as well.\n\nThe United Nations sponsored 1967 \"Outer Space Treaty\" established all of outer space as an international commons by describing it as the \"province of all mankind\" and forbidding all the nations from claiming territorial sovereignty. Article VI vests the responsibility for activities in space to States Parties, regardless of whether they are carried out by governments or non-governmental entities. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 had been ratified by 102 countries by 2013, including all the major space-faring nations. It has also been signed but not yet ratified by 26 other nations.\n\nA subsequent treaty document, the international Moon Treaty—finalised in 1979 (just five countries had ratified it by 1984, but five countries was sufficient for it to be considered officially \"in force\")—went further and forbade private ownership of extraterrestrial real estate. This agreement has not been widely ratified. with only 18 countries having ratified it by 2018.\n\nSeveral individuals and private organizations claimed ownership of the moon and other extraterrestrial bodies, but no such claims have yet been recognized. A white paper by the Competitive Enterprise Institute suggested legislation whereby the US would recognize claims made by private entities, American and others, which meet certain conditions regarding habitation and transportation. \n\nA number of individuals and organisations offer schemes or plans claiming to allow people to purchase portions of the Moon or other celestial bodies. Though the details of some of the schemes' legal arguments vary, one goes so far as to state that although the Outer Space Treaty, which entered force in 1967, forbids countries from claiming celestial bodies, there is no such provision forbidding private individuals from doing so. However, Article VI of this treaty states \"The activities of non-governmental entities in outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, shall require authorization and continuing supervision by the appropriate State Party to the Treaty.\" Thus, while it does not explicitly prohibit such schemes, the treaty does require they be authorized by the schemers' government.\n\nThe short story \"The Man Who Sold the Moon\" by Robert A. Heinlein, which was written in 1949, offers a portrayal regarding such plans or schemes, and created the concept of a Lunar Republic. Heinlein's \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" also makes reference to a space law case called the \"Larkin Decision\".\n\nA space ownership issue of current practical importance is the allocation of slots for satellites in geostationary orbit. This is managed by the International Telecommunication Union. The 1976 Declaration of the First Meeting of Equatorial Countries, also known as the Bogotá Declaration, signed by several countries located on the Earth's equator, attempted to assert sovereignty over those portions of the geostationary orbit that continuously lie over the signatory nation's territory. These claims did not receive wider international support or recognition and were subsequently largely abandoned.\n\nChilean lawyer Jenaro Gajardo Vera became famous for his 1953 claim of ownership of the Moon.\n\nMartin Juergens from Germany claims that the Moon has belonged to his family since July 15, 1756, when the Prussian king Frederick the Great presented it to his ancestor Aul Juergens as a symbolic gesture of gratitude for services rendered, and decreed that it should pass to the youngest born son.\n\nA. Dean Lindsay made claims for all extraterrestrial objects on June 15, 1936, and sent a letter to Pittsburgh Notary Public along with a deed and money for establishment of the property. The public sent offers to buy objects from him as well. He had previously made claims on the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.\n\nJames T. Mangan (1896–1970) was a famous eccentric, public relations man and best-selling author on self-help topics who publicly claimed ownership of outer space in 1948. Mangan founded what he called the \"Nation of Celestial Space\" and registered it with the Recorder of Deeds and Titles of Cook County, Illinois, on January 1, 1949.\n\nRobert R. Coles, former chairman of New York's Hayden Planetarium, started \"the interplanetary Development Corporation\" and sold lots on the moon for one dollar per acre.\n\nDennis Hope, an American entrepreneur, sells extraterrestrial real estate. In 1980, he started his own business, the Lunar Embassy Commission. As of 2009 Hope claimed to have sold 2.5M 1-acre plots on the Moon, for around US$20 per acre. He allocates land to be sold by closing his eyes and randomly pointing to a map of the Moon. He claims two former US presidents as customers, stating Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan had aides purchase the plots on the moon.\n\nIn 1997, Adam Ismail, Mustafa Khalil and Abdullah al-Umari, three men from Yemen, sued NASA for invading Mars. They claim that they \"inherited the planet from our ancestors 3,000 years ago\", before Muhammad. They based their argument on mythologies of the Himyaritic and Sabaean civilizations that existed several thousand years B.C.\n\nGregory W. Nemitz claimed ownership of Asteroid 433 Eros, on which NEAR Shoemaker landed in 2001. His company, called \"Orbital Development\", issued NASA an invoice of $20 for parking the spacecraft at the asteroid. NASA declined to pay, citing the lack of legal standing.\n\nRichard Garriott, computer game designer and astronaut's son, legitimately purchased the Lunokhod 2 lunar lander from the Russian Space Agency. Since then he jokingly claimed the rest of the Moon in the name of his gaming character, Lord British.\n\n\n"}

The Convention entered into force on 12 January 1951. It defines genocide in legal terms, and is the culmination of years of campaigning by lawyer Raphael Lemkin. All participating countries are advised to prevent and punish actions of genocide in war and in peacetime. As of December 2017, 149 states have ratified or acceded to the treaty, most recently Benin on 2 November 2017. One state, the Dominican Republic, has signed but not ratified the treaty.\n\nArticle 2 of the Convention defines genocide as\n\nArticle 3 defines the crimes that can be punished under the convention:\n\nThe convention was passed to outlaw actions similar to the Holocaust by Nazi Germany during World War II. The first draft of the Convention included political killings, but the USSR along with some other nations would not accept that actions against groups identified as holding similar political opinions or social status would constitute genocide, so these stipulations were subsequently removed in a political and diplomatic compromise.\n\nProvisos granting immunity from prosecution for genocide without its consent were made by Bahrain, Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, the United States, Vietnam, Yemen, and Yugoslavia. Prior to the United States Senate's ratification of the convention, Senator William Proxmire spoke in favor of the treaty to the Senate every day it was in session between 1967 and 1986.\n\n\nSeveral countries opposed this article, considering that the convention should apply to Non-Self-Governing Territories:\n\nThe opposition of those countries were in turn opposed by:\n\nIn 1988, following the campaign of chemical weapons attacks and mass killings of Kurdish persons in northern Iraq, legislation was proposed to the United States House of Representatives, in the, \"Prevention of Genocide Act\". The bill was defeated to allegations of \"inappropriate terms\" such as \"genocide\". Contemporary scholars and international organizations widely consider the Anfal Campaign to have been genocide following the Iran-Iraq war, killing tens of thousands of Kurds. Saddam Hussein was charged individual with genocide though executed prior to a return for the charge. Associates of Hussein such as \"Chemical Ali\", and others have been widely accused of genocide and the events widely cited as one of the atrocities most commonly associated with the Hussein regime.\n\nThe first time that the 1948 law was enforced occurred on 2 September 1998 when the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda found Jean-Paul Akayesu, the former mayor of a small town in Rwanda, guilty of nine counts of genocide. The lead prosecutor in this case was Pierre-Richard Prosper. Two days later, Jean Kambanda became the first head of government to be convicted of genocide.\n\nThe first state and parties to be found in breach of the Genocide convention was Serbia and Montenegro, and numerous Bosnian Serb leaders. In the \"Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro\" case the International Court of Justice presented its judgment on 26 February 2007. It cleared Serbia of direct involvement in genocide during the Bosnian war.\nInternational Tribunal findings, have addressed two allegations of genocidal events, including the 1992 Ethnic Cleansing Campaign in municipalities throughout Bosnia, as well as the convictions found in regards to the Srebrenica Massacre of 1995 in which the tribunal found, \"Bosnian Serb forces committed genocide, they targeted for extinction, the 40,000 Bosnian Muslims of Srebrenica ... the trial chamber refers to the crimes by their appropriate name, genocide ...\". Individual convictions applicable to the 1992 Ethnic Cleansings have not been secured however. A number domestic courts and legislatures have found these events to have met the criteria of genocide, and the ICTY found the acts of, and intent to destroy to have been satisfied, the \"Dolus Specialis\" still in question and before the MICT, UN war crimes court. but ruled that Belgrade did breach international law by failing to prevent the 1995 Srebrenica genocide, and for failing to try or transfer the persons accused of genocide to the ICTY, in order to comply with its obligations under Articles I and VI of the Genocide Convention, in particular in respect of General Ratko Mladić.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council is the organization entitled to mandate the International Criminal Court with investigations relating to breaches of the genocide convention.\n\nAt present (2018) the procedure relating to Darfur, Sudan, opened in 2005, is the only genocide related pending one. Warrants to arrest Omar Hassan Ahmad Al Bashir, president of the Republic of Sudan, were issued in 2009 and 2010. The case remains in the Pre-Trial stage as the suspect is still at large.\n\nOne of the first accusations of genocide submitted to the UN after the Convention entered into force concerned treatment of Black Americans. The Civil Rights Congress drafted a 237-page petition arguing that even after 1945, the United States had been responsible for hundreds of wrongful deaths, both legal and extra-legal, as well as numerous other genocidal abuses. Leaders from the Black community, including William Patterson, Paul Robeson, and W. E. B. DuBois presented this petition to the UN in December 1951. However, this accusation was a domestic political act by the Civil Rights Congress, without any reservations that a formal charge would be levied against the U.S.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "49092077", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49092077", "title": "Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission", "text": "Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission\n\nThe Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission was established in 2004 based on the events of November 3, 1979. On that date, the Communist Workers Party (CWP) led by Robert Johnson gathered at the Morningside Homes in Greensboro, North Carolina, to protest for social and economic justice along with protesting against the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). The chant that united the 40–50 protesters was “death to the Klan”. Shortly after 11 am, a nine-vehicle convoy that contained 37 members of the KKK and the American Nazi Party arrived. After a short skirmish, the KKK and American Nazis retrieved their firearms and 88 seconds later, five protesters lay dead and ten others were wounded. During the marking of the 20th anniversary of the events that became known as the “Greensboro massacre”, the idea was raised to bring closure and to bring to light the truth to the events of November 3, 1979. Within five years, The Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission was formed by mainly private and local donations. The seven commissioners in 2006 released their report, which condemned not only the KKK and the American Nazi Party, but also the Greensboro Police Department and the city itself for being responsible for the events of November 3, 1979, and the subsequent cover-up.\n\nOn November 3, 1979, a group numbering between 40 to 50 demonstrators arrived at the Morningside Housing projects in Greensboro, North Carolina at 11 a.m. for a peaceful march, aimed at advancing social, economic and racial justice and to protest against the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). The march, organized by Nelson Johnson of the Communist Workers Party and set to begin at twelve noon, was confronted by a convoy of nine vehicles, containing 37 members of the KKK and the American Nazi Party. These members proceeded to leave their vehicles, confronted the protesters with long pieces of lumber, igniting a violent fight. After a short skirmish, members of the KKK and the American Nazi Party retreated to their vehicles and retrieved their firearms, including shotguns, semi-automatic rifles, and pistols. A number of individuals began to fire their weapons, lasting a span of eighty-eight seconds, at the protesters. Five protesters, Cesar Cauce, Dr. James Waller, Sandra Smith, Bill Simpson and Dr. Michael Nathan, were killed, and ten others wounded. Nelson Johnson was, for his part, tackled by law enforcement, detained, and ultimately arrested for starting a riot. Johnson later stated, “I knew that in the depths of my soul that we had been set up.” A curfew was immediately implemented at the Morningside neighborhood, followed by the deployment of the North Carolina National Guard, and public service announcements to deter anyone from participating in any further marches.\nAt a neighboring area adjacent to the Morningside Housing Project, Claudette Burroughs-White was home when a child ran up to her and informed her of the events he witnessed. “I thought he was losing his mind. When I found out that it was the truth, I was just so angry. It was scary that in broad daylight the Klan was shooting. You start gathering up your children and say come in this house until we find out what’s going on. [The fact that] you can look on television and see people just shooting people, and at the end of all of that, nobody gets a day in prison time. It is still unbelievable. It is just unbelievable.”\nThese events, termed the “Greensboro Massacre,” were captured live by the press and profiled on national news outlets including the CBS Evening News, anchored by Walter Cronkite. The “Greensboro Massacre” would ironically be quickly overshadowed the following day with the onset of the Iran Hostage Crisis.\nFuneral services for the protesters were attended by upwards of 800 people, with 1,000 law enforcement officials specifically assigned to maintain social order in Greensboro.\n\nThe impetus for the establishment of the Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission emerged in conjunction with the twentieth anniversary of the events of November 3, 1979. The driving force behind the creation of the commission was to objectively review precisely what transpired that day. For years, rumours circulated suggesting that the Greensboro Police Department was directly involved, and that the city, in order to protect its police department and itself, immediately undertook steps following the massacre to initiate a cover up. A commission, its supporters argued, could bring closure to the families of the deceased, as well as the remaining survivors.\nBetween November 3, 1979, and November 3, 1999, three significant criminal and civil cases directly pertaining to the “Greensboro Massacre” unfolded. In the case of the first two trials – the second of which was a federal court case – all-white juries acquitted the accused parties, despite eyewitness testimony and above all, video news footage of the KKK and the American Nazi Party shooting at the crowd of protesters. The third trial case, focusing on the death of one of the “Greensboro Massacre” victims, resulted in the conviction of two Greensboro Police officers, four Klansmen, and two members of the American Nazi Party. The city of Greensboro was ordered to pay $351,500 in restitution. This judicial finding and associated financial penalty suggested that the city of Greensboro and its police department were more prominently involved and directly aware of the events of November 3, 1979, than previously suggested. These reasons directly contributed to the establishment of the Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission.\nThe Greensboro Truth and Community Reconciliation Project, or simply “the Project”, founded in November 1999, called for an independent truth and reconciliation commission to be created to investigate the events of November 3, 1979. The principal and most immediate issue confronting the establishment of a potential commission was the ability to secure necessary funding to undertake the required work. Significant funding primary was ultimately donated by the Andrus Family Fund, with the International Center for Transitional Justice providing supplementary financial support. The overriding objectives of the Andrus Family Fund and the Project itself were not punitive in nature; they were not seeking to legally or financially sanction the responsible parties (i.e., the KKK and the American Nazi Party), but instead sought to identify constructive avenues designed to facilitate societal reconciliation. This reconciliation, it was held, could be most fully realized by utilizing an approach that objectively examined the truth surrounding the Greensboro Massacre. It was later decided in October 2002, to remove the term “Massacre” in respect to the victims and survivors. On January 10, 2003, 32 prominent Greensboro community members with ties to both the city and county government, including then city councilor Claudette Burroughs-White, declared their support for the establishment of a truth and reconciliation commission.\nA process was identified for the selection of seven volunteer commissioners to serve on what would come to be known as the Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The mandate of the Commission was decidedly specific – no matter how painful it might prove to be, its core mission would be to reveal and disseminate the truth. From a total of 67 nominees put forward in February 2004, the selection committee was given 90 days to agree on 7 commissioners. This committee, in considering applicants, was empowered to consider an applicant’s character and relationship to Greensboro. Specific characteristics that the selection committee sought out included “demonstrating commitment to the values of truth, reconciliation, equity and justice; will commit to seek the truth; will commit to not allow outside forces to taint the work/report of the commissioners; interest in racial, socio-economic, religious and gender diversity; and knowledge of human rights and legal framework.” \nOn May 27, 2004, the seven commissioners (five women and two men) were publicly announced; the list included Muktha Jost, Bob Peters, Barbara Walker, Pat Clark, Cynthia Brown, Angela Lawrence, and Mark Sills. Three (Jost, Brown and Lawrence) were African American, and Lawrence, Sills (who also served on the selection committee) and Brown were native North Carolinians.\n\nInitially, the commission encountered significant difficulty in collecting statements from the survivors, as many individuals were wary of the commission's mandate and its ability to effect durable social change. The commission was ultimately successful in securing the cooperation of survivors by conducting one-on-one interviews. This resulted in the collection of 145 oral statements. The commission also granted requests from a dozen individuals (who wished to remain anonymous), to include their statements in the final report. Included in the oral statements were testimonials of 17 demonstrators and 14 people from the-then Morningside Homes (which were demolished in 2002), along with 7 written accounts. The Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission was also successful in obtaining statements from six current or former Greensboro police officers, five current or former members of the KKK and the American Nazi Party, and a judge. Three public hearings were held (two at local area universities, and one at a high school), each of which transpired over a two-day period (Friday and Saturday). For the commissioners' safety, each public hearing featured a significant police presence. \nFollowing the conclusion of the first hearing, Bongani Finca, a commissioner on the South Africa Truth and Reconciliation Commission reminded commissioners that, “your credibility is on the line; you need to be pressing for answers. You can be respectful, but you need to ask tougher questions.” \nThe ability of the commission, however, to secure additional statements was constrained by a range of factors:\nMembers of the Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission, in the course of their work, realized that there was not a consensus in Greensboro on which parties or specific actions were culpable, nor on who constituted a victim.\n\nOn May 25, 2006, the commission “held a ceremony in the chapel at Bennett College for Women to release its final report to the public.” Totaling in excess of 500 pages, the commission’s report found that Nelson Johnson did indeed plan the march, which was state-wide, for the stated purposes of promoting social, economic and racial justice. Johnson had also followed proper procedure by applying for a parade permit from the Greensboro Police Department, listing Morningside Homes as the starting point for the march. The police, however, gave their informant, Klan member Eddie Dawson, a copy of the permit which provided the exact route and time of the march. The report also revealed that the police were well aware of the history between, on the one hand, the KKK and the American Nazi Party, and the Communist Workers Party (CWP) on the other. There had been an earlier confrontation between the groups in China Grove, North Carolina, and it was clear that the KKK and the American Nazi Party were purposely looking for an opportunity to exact revenge. The police also knew that it was the intention of both the KKK and the American Nazi Party to confront the protesters, make an attempt to prevent the march from occurring, and above all, that members from each group would very likely be armed with firearms. The police further knew that if the march was in fact disrupted, that Klan and American Nazi Party members would be acting in direct violation of the protesters' right of free speech and their right to assemble, both of which are protected in the First Amendment of the United States constitution. In advance of the march, Johnson was required by the Greensboro police to sign a form agreeing that he and his fellow protesters and he would not be armed. Though some did defy the agreement, North Carolina laws in 1979 did not make it illegal for the protesters to carry weapons. The commission found, “The idea of armed self-defense is acceptable and deeply embedded in our national identity and tradition [yet] there is a double standard by which armed black people are seen as an unacceptable threat.”\nJohnson, the report of the commission makes clear, was never notified or warned in advance by Greensboro police of the Klan and American Nazi Party’s intentions regarding the march. The police went so far as to purposely station all of its officers in a perimeter some five to twenty-four blocks away from the Morningside Housing Projects. When Officer April Wise and her colleague were at the Morningside Homes to investigate an act of domestic violence, they were intentionally called back by their superiors. Police in the field were effectively ordered to stay at their posts. They did this even when a plainclothes officer reported the approaching caravan of KKK and American Nazi Party members. Greensboro police officers even stayed put after the shootings, deciding to only stop the last car in the caravan.\nImmediately following the “Greensboro Massacre”, the commission’s report found that the city of Greensboro took immediate and significant steps to purposely deflect critical attention and deliberately conceal critical facts from the public. The Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Report underscores the “intentionality [of the Greensboro Police] to provide adequate protection and deliberately [mislead] the public in regarding what happened on November 3, 1979.” The report further claimed that compelling “evidence of deliberate manipulation and concealment of the facts that we can only interpret as intended to sever the Greensboro Police Department from any responsibility” existed. Greensboro’s mayor and other city officials, the commission’s report advances, went so far as to intimidate news stations to not broadcast footage of the “Greensboro Massacre.” \"The events of November 3, 1979 and the days that followed produced “general distrust of police, the justice system, elected officials and the media.” The commission found that the police department had underestimated the threat posed by the KKK and the American Nazi Party, and overestimated their perceived threat of Johnson and the CWP.\n\nThe commission offered several recommendations.\n\nThe work of the commission and its subsequent recommendations elicited both positive and negative responses. The commission’s report, according to Nelson Johnson, was a “gift” suggesting others in the community of Greensboro needed to read and benefit from it. An editorial on the commission's final report, authored by Allen Johnson of the Greensboro \"News & Record\", found that as an “overall body of work, the report is well researched and documented”, and that, “despite its flaws and arguably even because of them, the report provides a valuable opportunity for reflection.” \nThe mayor of Greensboro, Jim Melvin, on November 3, 1979, – within a day or two of the final report being made public - stated that, “I’ll stand on the reputation of the police department. We had a good police department on November 3[rd.]” Mayor Keith Holliday, who was Greensboro’s mayor when the report was publicly issued, decided to reject the commission’s recommendations calling for the Greensboro police department and the city itself to apologize for what happened on November 3, 1979. Holliday instead preferred to simply express regret for the events of that day. Two Democratic Party Guilford County Commissioners expressed their support for the commission’s specific recommendations in favor of a living wage and antiracist training – both of which were opposed by a Republican-controlled Guilford County commission.\n\n"}

As deputy head of the counter-espionage bureau in the Abwehr (German military intelligence), Oster was in a strong position to conduct resistance operations under the guise of intelligence work; he was dismissed for helping Jews to avoid arrest.\n\nHe was a key planner of the Oster Conspiracy of September 1938. Oster was arrested in 1943 on suspicion of helping Abwehr officers caught helping Jews escape Germany. After the failed 1944 July Plot on Hitler's life, the Gestapo seized the diaries of Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, the head of the \"Abwehr\", in which Oster's long term anti-Nazi activities were revealed. In April 1945, he was hanged with Canaris and Dietrich Bonhoeffer at Flossenbürg concentration camp.\n\nOster was born in Dresden, Saxony in 1887, the son of an Alsatian pastor of the French Protestant Church. He entered the artillery in 1907. In World War I, he served on the Western Front until 1916, when he was appointed as captain to the German General Staff. After the war, he was thought of well enough to be kept in the reduced \"Reichswehr\", whose officer corps was limited to 4,000 by the Treaty of Versailles. However, he had to resign from the army in 1932, when he got into trouble because of an indiscretion during the carnival in the demilitarised zone of the Rhineland, where \"Reichswehr\" officers were prohibited.\n\nHe soon found a job in a new organisation which Hermann Göring set up under the Prussian police. He transferred to the \"Abwehr\" in October 1933. It was in this connection that he met future conspirators Hans Bernd Gisevius and Arthur Nebe, who were then working in the \"Gestapo\". Oster also became a close confidant of Admiral Canaris.\n\nLike many other army officers, Oster initially welcomed the Nazi regime, but his opinion changed after the 1934 \"Night of the Long Knives\", in which the \"Schutzstaffel\" (SS) extrajudicially murdered many of the leaders of the rival \"Sturmabteilung\" (SA) and their political opponents, including General Kurt von Schleicher, the second to last Chancellor of the Weimar Republic, and Generalmajor (Major General) Ferdinand von Bredow, former head of the \"Abwehr\". In 1935, Oster was allowed to re-enlist in the army, but never on the General Staff. By 1938, the Blomberg–Fritsch Affair and \"Kristallnacht\" (the state-sanctioned pogrom against Jews in Germany), turned his antipathy into a hatred of Nazism and a willingness to help save Jews. In the course of the Fritsch crisis, Oster met Generaloberst (Colonel General) Ludwig Beck, Chief of the General Staff, for the first time, laying the connections for the Oster Conspiracy of September 1938.\n\nOster's position in the \"Abwehr\" was invaluable to the conspiracy. The \"Abwehr\" could provide false papers and restricted materials, provide cover by disguising conspiratorial activities as intelligence work, link various resistance cells that were otherwise disparate, and supply intelligence to the conspirators. He also played a central role in the first military conspiracy to overthrow Hitler, which was rooted in Hitler's intention to invade Czechoslovakia. In August 1938, Beck spoke openly at a meeting of army generals in Berlin about his opposition to a war with the Western powers over Czechoslovakia. When Hitler was informed of this, he demanded and received Beck's resignation. Beck was highly respected in the army and his removal shocked the officer corps. His successor as Chief of Staff, Franz Halder, remained in touch with him and also with Oster. Privately, he said that he considered Hitler \"the incarnation of evil.\" \n\nOster informed his friend Bert Sas, the Netherlands' military attaché in Berlin, more than twenty times of the exact date of the repeatedly delayed invasion of the Netherlands. Sas passed the information to his government, but was not believed. Oster calculated that his \"treason\" could cost the lives of 40,000 German soldiers and wrestled with his decision, but concluded that it was necessary to prevent millions of deaths that would occur in what would be undoubtedly a protracted war should Germany achieve an early victory.\nOster was arrested one day after the failed 20 July plot to assassinate Hitler. On 4 April 1945, the diaries of Admiral Canaris were discovered, and in a rage upon reading them, Hitler ordered that all current and past conspirators—Oster among them—be executed.\nFabian von Schlabrendorff, one of the few major coordinators of anti-Nazi activities to survive the war, described Oster as \"a man such as God meant men to be, lucid and serene in mind, imperturbable in danger.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12625961", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12625961", "title": "Harriton v Stephens", "text": "Harriton v Stephens\n\nHarriton v Stephens, was a decision of the High Court of Australia handed down on 9 May 2006, in which the court dismissed a \"wrongful life\" claim brought by a disabled woman seeking the right to compensation for being born after negligent medical advice that resulted in her mother's pregnancy not being terminated.\n\nThe appellant, Alexia Harriton, was a 25-year-old woman with severe congenital disabilities that had been caused by her mother's infection with the rubella virus while pregnant with her. These disabilities left Harriton unable to care for herself.\n\nThe defendant, Paul Richard Stephens, was the doctor of Harriton's mother while she was pregnant. After conducting and reviewing pathological tests, Dr Stephens advised the mother that she did not have the rubella virus. Harriton's mother claimed that she would have had her pregnancy terminated had she known of the chances of having a disabled child.\n\nHarriton sued Dr Stephens in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, claiming that Dr Stephens failed to exercise reasonable care in his treatment of her mother, and but for that failure her mother would have terminated her pregnancy and Harriton would not have been born. The judge hearing the action, Justice Tim Studdert, dismissed the action as well as two other wrongful life cases brought at the same time.\n\nTwo of the three wrongful life cases dismissed by Justice Studdert (\"Harriton\" and \"Waller v James\") were appealed to the New South Wales Court of Appeal (an appellate division of the Supreme Court). The Court of Appeal, by a majority of 2–1 dismissed both appeals. According to Chief Justice James Spigelman, the proposition that the duty of doctor to an unborn child extended to conduct that, properly performed, would lead to the termination of the pregnancy \"should not be accepted as it does not reflect values generally, or even widely, held in the community.\"\n\nOn 29 April 2005, Harriton and Waller were granted special leave to appeal to the High Court. Their appeals were heard together on 10 November 2005. Brett Walker acted as senior counsel for Harriton instructed by Maurice Blackburn Cashman; Blake Dawson acted for Stephens with Stephen Gageler as senior counsel.\n\nThe High Court decided on 9 May 2006, by a 6–1 majority, to dismiss Harriton's appeal. Waller's appeal was dismissed on the same day with the majority in that judgment following the reasons in Harriton's appeal. The leading judgment was written by Justice Crennan, with whom Chief Justice Gleeson and Justices Gummow and Heydon concurred, giving her reasons majority support. Justices Callinan and Hayne wrote separate judgments agreeing to dismiss the appeal, while Justice Kirby dissented.\n\nThe High Court's judgment was reported in the media as a \"landmark case\". Richard Ackland, a journalist and lawyer, criticised the judgment in the Sydney Morning Herald, arguing:\n\nWhat the majority position fails to accommodate is that there is a new modern order. Medical technology can detect abnormalities at very early stages of the development of a foetus. Good medical practice regularly results in the non-existence of human beings. What has been created by way of Alexia [Harriton] and Keeden [Waller] is precisely what the doctors were engaged to prevent being created.\n\nMargaret Fordham, a legal academic, wrote after the judgment that for wrongful life claims to gain acceptance, \"the courts would have to undergo a complete change of heart with respect to the moral and ethical implications of such actions\". Academics Evelyn Ellis and Brenda McGivern referred to the judgment as an emphatic rejection of claims for wrongful life and compared the judgment to similar rejections of wrongful life claims by courts in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe outcome of the judgment was criticised in the \"Sydney Law Review\", which concluded:\n\nLogic might have demanded the outcome reached by the High Court in \"Harriton\", but fairness demands another.\n\nDean Stretton, a lawyer writing in the \"Melbourne University Law Review\", claimed that the High Court's judgment \"regressed\", \"depriving the plaintiffs of a legally justified remedy by resort to inconsistent logic and ill-considered policy\".\n\n"}
{"id": "3214516", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3214516", "title": "History of the Egyptian Constitution", "text": "History of the Egyptian Constitution\n\nThe Constitution of Egypt has passed over a long period of evolution from the liberal constitution of 1923 to the contemporary constitution.\n\nEgypt is known for having one of the earliest administrative and legislative codes in history. \nPharaonic civilization laid the groundwork in Egypt in terms of governance and management. The king, or Pharaoh, at the top of the state hierarchy, appointed high-ranking government officials.\n\nDuring the Islamic era, governance and legislation were principally drawn from the Qur'an and the Sunna (Traditions of the Prophet) based on the formula of consultation as one of the fundamental principles of Islamic law.\n\nWhen Egypt became the capital of the Shi'ite Fatimid Caliphate (969-1171) governance and legislation developed. Furthermore, the city of Cairo became the capital of Egypt.\n\nThroughout the era of the Ayubi state (1171–1250), the Citadel became the headquarters and the center of power. Legislative and judicial councils diversified, and there was a justice council and another to attend to complaints lodged. Their duties involved laws as well as treaties with foreign countries\n\nIn the Mamluk era (1250–1517) Sultan El-Zaher Bebars built the Court of Justice at Salah El-Deen El-Ayoubi Citadel to be the government premises. Its competence covered enforcement of laws, settling of disputes, and negotiations with nearby countries.\n\nDuring the Ottoman era, (1517–1805) Islamic courts constituted the judicial system. Judges had their verdicts directly based on Islamic jurisprudence (Sharia) as far as civil and criminal disputes were concerned. This continued in effect until the end of the 18th Century. Thus, Egypt had been the scene of crucial political and social developments.\n\nIn 1795, almost six years after the French revolution, a major political uprising demanding rights, freedoms and justice fueled. It brought together national forces and popular leaderships in support of national demands for justice, equality, and freedom.\n\nAs a result of the mounting resistance against the Ottoman ruler, the Wali, and Mamluks, Egypt was on the verge of a massive revolt. This led to the Ulama laying their hands on a written document which outlined the relationship between the ruler and subject which averted a raise in taxes without the consent of the people's representatives.\n\nThe first 20th century constitution for Egypt is that of 1923.\nIn December 1952 there was the first constitutional declaration then in 10th of February 1953 there was a second constitutional declaration.\n\nIn 1956, a new Constitution was proclaimed stipulating the formation of the National Assembly on 22 July 1957. It was made up of 350 elected members and remained effective until 10 February 1958, when the Egyptian-Syrian merger was given force and the 1956 Constitution revoked. The Provisional Constitution of the Arab Republic of Egypt was formulated in March 1958, and a joint National Assembly was established. It first met on 21 July 1960 and lasted to 22 June 1961.\n\nOn 27 September 1962, after the secession of the Syrian Arab Republic from the United Arab Republic, a Constitutional Proclamation was made, which stipulated that the Provisional Constitution of 1958 should remain in force insofar as it did not contradict the Proclamation. In March 1964, a further provisional Constitution was declared, leading to a 350-elected member National Assembly. This Assembly lasted from 26 March 1964 to 12 November 1968. New elections were held on 20 January 1969, and the Assembly was valid until 30 August 1971.\n\nIn 1971, when President Anwar Sadat took office, he moved towards the adoption of a new democratic constitution that would allow more freedoms; the return to a more sound parliamentary life, correct democratic practice and made Sharia \"a source of legislation\" (article II), amended in 1980 to read \"the principal source of legislation.\"\n\nIn 2005, President Hosni Mubarak asked the parliament to amend Article 76 of the constitution that defines how the President of Egypt is elected.\n\nDuring the 2011 Egyptian revolution, opponents to President Mubarak demanded modifications to the constitution or rewriting it. On 10 February 2011, Mubarak stated that he had requested that Articles 76, 77, 88, 93 and 181 be amended and that Article 179 be removed. Following Mubarak's resignation, the military government of Egypt appointed the Egyptian constitutional review committee of 2011 and proposed that Articles 76, 77, 88, 93, 139, 148 and 189 be amended and Article 179 removed.\nOn March 30, a new provisional constitution was adopted based on the amended articles in addition to other aimed at steering through the transition period of constitutional reform. A new constitution was approved in 2012.\n\nPresident Mohamed Morsi was overthrown on 3 July 2013 in a coup d'état, necessitating the revision of the constitution. A constitutional referendum took place from 14–15 January 2014.\n\n"}
{"id": "34292540", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34292540", "title": "Holdout (real estate)", "text": "Holdout (real estate)\n\nA holdout is a piece of property that did not become part of a larger real estate development because the owner either refused to sell or wanted more than the developer would pay. There are many examples of hold-outs in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, China, Japan, and other countries.\n\nMacy's department store in New York City, for example, does not cover the whole block because of a holdout named the Million Dollar Corner on the corner of Broadway and W 34th Street. Now decorated as a Macy's shopping bag, the building is a holdout from the construction of Macy's Herald Square, and received its name from the fact that it sold for a million dollars in 1911, an unprecedented sum at the time.\n\nSimilarly, 30 Rockefeller Center, also in New York, has slight setbacks at its corners of 49th and 50th streets on 6th Avenue due to two buildings at those corners. The owner of 1258 6th Avenue, John F. Maxwell, grandson of the original owner, outright refused to sell to John D. Rockefeller during his land grab for construction of the complex, whereas, while Rockefeller was successful in purchasing the townhouse at 1240 6th Avenue, the lessees, who had signed a long-term lease, refused to vacate unless they were bought out to their asking sum of $250 million (equivalent to $ billion in 2018).\n\nIn Whitechapel, in the East End of London, the construction of the department store Wickhams, completed in 1927, on the north side of the Mile End Road was obstructed by the Spiegelhalter brothers who owned and ran a jewellers at no. 81. The store building was completed around the jewellers shop.\n\nThe construction of new runway capacity at Narita International Airport in Japan starting in the 1990s was met with significant local protest; in one example, families refused to move even as the original and subsequent runway construction projects began around them.\n\nIn the United States, private property is protected by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution from seizure by the government without \"just compensation\". Under the concept of eminent domain, local and national government agencies are entitled to take private property for purposes in the public interest, but must offer owners compensation amounting to the value of the property. The United Kingdom, New Zealand, and the Republic of Ireland have a comparable process called compulsory purchase, and there are equivalent laws in Australia and South Africa. In \"Kelo v. City of New London\", the United States Supreme Court held that the government is entitled to take land from private parties for any reason, including to give to private developers. The decision was widely unpopular, and spurred various states to enact laws prohibiting the practice, restricting eminent domain seizures to public works projects. However, the practice is common in other states. The efforts generally begin with an offer by the private group or government agency to purchase the land, and only become a question of eminent domain if the parties cannot negotiate a purchase price.\n\nWhen eminent domain seizures do occur there are often disputes over the value of the property, and whether it should fully compensate the landowner for the holdout value of the land. A historical example of a San Francisco nail house resulted in railroad investor Charles Crocker building a spite fence around a house owned by undertaker Nicolas Yung in the late 1870s, after Yung refused to sell his small property to Crocker, who was consolidating lots on which to build a mansion. Other contemporary examples include Edith Macefield, who refused to sell her Seattle house to a developer, and Randal Acker who challenged the power of eminent domain in Portland, Oregon.\n\nThe People's Republic of China passed its first modern private property law in March 2007 amid the property development bubble.\n\nA nail house is a Chinese neologism for homes belonging to people (sometimes called \"stubborn nails\") who refuse to make room for real estate development. The term, a pun coined by developers, refers to nails that are stuck in wood, and cannot be pounded down with a hammer.\n\nIn the People's Republic of China, during most of the Communist era, private ownership of real property was abolished. The central government officially owned all real estate, and could in theory dictate who was entitled to control any piece of property according to national interests. Private citizens, therefore, did not have a legal right to keep their property if the government decided they should leave (although in practice, entitlements arose for various reasons). With a strengthening economy and the rise of free markets beginning in the late 1990s, private developers began building shopping malls, hotels, and other private developments in densely populated urban centers, which required displacing residents who lived on the land. Developers would typically offer relatively low compensation to the residents, reflecting the pre-development value of their properties or the cost of obtaining alternative housing elsewhere. Should residents resist, or try to take advantage of their bargaining position, powerful developers could persuade local officials and courts to order residents off the land. In other cases, residents would be arrested on false charges or thugs would be hired to scare away the residents.\n\nMore recently, the People's Republic of China has begun to accept private ownership of real estate, including the still-controversial notion that owners are free to earn money when their land becomes more valuable due to planned developments, or even simply not to sell. Discontent arose among the people over accusations of illegal land seizures by developers and corruption by complicit government officials.\n\nIn March 2007, the People's Republic of China passed its first modern private property law. The law prohibits government taking of land, except when it is in the public interest. The law strengthened the position of nail house owners, but did not entirely resolve whether making room for private commercial developments was a public interest that entitled the taking of land.\n\nA number of high-profile nail houses have received widespread attention in the Chinese press. In one case in 2007, one family among 280 others at the location of a six-story shopping mall under construction at the location of a former \"snack street\" in Chongqing refused for two years to vacate a home their family had inhabited for three generations. Developers cut their power and water, and excavated a 10-meter deep pit around their home. The owners broke into the construction site, reoccupied it, and flew a Chinese flag on top. Yang Wu, a local martial arts champion, used nunchakus to make a staircase to their house, and threatened to beat any authorities who attempted to evict him. His wife, a restaurateur named Wu Ping who had planned to open a restaurant in the home's ground floor, granted interviews and frequent press releases to generate publicity. The owners turned down an offer of 3.5 million yuan (US $453,000), but eventually settled with the developers in 2007.\n\nIn another example, a nail house remained in Changsha, even after a shopping mall was built around it, and now sits in a courtyard of the mall. One owner in Shenzhen was paid between 10 and 20 million yuan (US $1.3 million to $2.7 million) for selling a seven-story building at the site of the future 439-meter (1,440 foot) Kingkey Finance Tower, that had cost him 1 million yuan ($130,000) to build ten years before. The resident held out for months following an eviction order, and was subject to harassment and extortion attempts even after he reached a settlement. Two other nail house owners held out against the Kingkey development.\n\nAnother nail house became notable after it ended up in the middle of a new road in Wenling, Zhejiang Province. The elderly couple had refused to sell the property for the price offered by the government since 2001. Eventually a major two-lane road to a new train station was constructed around the house. Pictures of the home went viral on the Internet and were widely published by Chinese media. The property was demolished in December 2012 after the owners accepted a compensation offer worth $41,000.\n\nIn Houston, Texas was an example of a commercial building that was a nail house. When a new skyscraper office complex (Bank of America Center) was built in 1983 at the block bordered by Louisiana Street, Capitol Street, Rusk Street and Smith Street, the corner of Louisana and Rusk Streets held a major communications hub for the Western Union Company. It was not possible for them to move this hub in an economical fashion, so they became a special kind of holdout. The builder (Gerald D. Hines) negotiated with them, and actually built the new office tower over the top of the existing Western Union building, and completely wrapped the old building with a new facade that matched the new building. In 2018 , the Western Union facility was abandoned, demolished and the office tower took over that space also. \n\nNail houses have received an unusual degree of coverage in the Chinese press. The Chongqing incident was initially called \"coolest nail house in history\" by a blogger, after which the incident was picked up by major media throughout China, including state-run newspapers, and became a national sensation. 85% of respondents to a poll on sina.com supported the couple rather than the developers. Later, however, the Chinese government forbade newspapers from reporting on the event. Another blogger, vegetable vendor Zhou Shuguang, traveled by train from his home in Hunan province to cover the incident, funded by donations from his readers. Writing under the pen name \"zola\", Zhou interviewed the participants, as well as crowds that had gathered and others who claimed to have been evicted from their homes. He was popularly referred to as China's first \"citizen journalist\" although his site was blocked as well. Others defied the prohibition as well, including the Chinese edition of \"Sports Illustrated\", which worked a subtle reference of the incident into a magazine cover.\n\n\n\n"}

Industry observers believe IUU occurs in most fisheries, and accounts for up to 30% of total catches in some important fisheries.\n\nIllegal fishing takes place when vessels or harvesters operate in violation of the laws of a fishery. This can apply to fisheries that are under the jurisdiction of a coastal state or to high seas fisheries regulated by regional fisheries management organisations (RFMO). According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Fisheries and Aquaculture Department, illegal fishing has caused losses estimated at US$23 billion per year with about 30% of illegal fishing in the world occurring in Indonesia alone.\n\nUnreported fishing is fishing that has been unreported or misreported to the relevant national authority or RFMO, in contravention of applicable laws and regulations.\n\nUnregulated fishing generally refers to fishing by vessels without nationality, vessels flying the flag of a country not party to the RFMO governing that fishing area or species on the high seas, or harvesting in unregulated areas.\n\nThe drivers behind illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing are similar to those behind many other types of international environmental crime: pirate fishers have a strong economic incentive -- many species of fish, particularly those that have been over-exploited and are thus in short supply, are of high financial value.\n\nSuch IUU activity may then show a high chance of success – i.e. a high rate of return – from the failure of governments to regulate adequately (e.g. inadequate coverage of international agreements), or to enforce national or international laws (e.g. because of lack of capacity, or poor levels of governance). A particular driver behind IUU fishing is the failure of a number of flag states to exercise effective regulation over ships on their registers — which in turn creates an incentive for ships to register under these flags of convenience.\n\nSince no one reports catches made by pirates, their level of fishing cannot be accurately quantified. \n\nOne economic impact of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing on developing countries is the direct loss of the value of the catches that could be taken by local fishermen if the IUU fishing were not taking place.\n\nThese losses include a loss to GNP, and government revenues from landing fees, licence fees, and taxes payable by legal fishing operators. There are further indirect impacts in terms of loss of income and employment in related industries; losses in income will tend to reduce the consumer expenditures of families working in the fishing industry.\n\nIUU harvests may be brought to market at a lower price as unfair competition to the same products from the regulated supply or as a mislabeled competing product. In either situation this illegal unregulated contribution to the market may lower the overall quality and price of products available, thus creating an economic burden on harvesters following the laws and regulations.\n\nIllegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing can have a significant impact on the sustainability of both the targeted species and the ecosystem. Fishing generally has the capacity to damage fragile marine ecosystems and vulnerable species such as coral reefs, turtles and seabirds. In fact, all eight sea turtle species are now endangered, and illegal fishing and hunting are two major reasons for their destruction. Regulating legitimate fisheries is aimed at mitigating such impacts, but IUU fishers rarely comply with regulations. This may reduce future productivity and biodiversity and create imbalances in the ecosystem.\n\nThis may lead to reduced food security in communities heavily dependent on fish as a source of animal protein.\n\nIUU fishing can also lead to increased pressure on endangered fish species. IUU fishing can directly affect the population of fish species by increasing the number of fish caught within the population in spite of population management efforts by the international community. Indirectly, the substitution (mislabeling) of IUU caught fish for popular, but threatened or endangered species, increases the perceived supply of these species, thus decreasing the price and increasing the demand for the fish species.\n\nMandatory product certification and catch documentation are increasingly part of fishery monitoring and enforcement, and to exclude IUU products from consumer markets. Certification is also used for timber and for diamonds, which have analogous enforcement problems. Labels can reward harvesters and supply chains which honor regulations. Labeling may also provide accountability for adaptive management planning, as well-managed fisheries may provide higher quality products and more stable economics for producers.\n\nThe use of certification or catch document schemes is encouraged in the FAO's International Plan of Action on IUU Fishing. Several RFMOs include them, including CCAMLR's Catch Documentation Scheme for Toothfish, CCSBT's Trade Information Scheme for Southern Bluefin Tuna and ICCAT's Bluefin Tuna Statistical Document Programme. Similar systems are applied at a national level, including the USA's Certification of Origin of Tuna and Tuna Tracking and Verification Systems, Japan's reporting requirements (including area of capture) for all imports or transportation of tunas into Japan by boat, and the EU’s labelling of all fish products (including area of capture).\n\nThe Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) is an international non-profit organization that runs a certification and ecolabelling program for traceable, sustainable seafood.\n\nTo achieve certification as sustainable a fishery must meet a standard based on three principles:\n\n\nFisheries that meet the MSC standard for a sustainable fishery can use the blue MSC ecolabel on their seafood products.\n\nThe second element of the program is a certification for seafood traceability. This is called MSC Chain of Custody. From the fishery, every company in the supply chain that handles the certified fish is checked to ensure the MSC label is only applied to fish products that come from a certified fishery. This requires effective record-keeping and storage procedures. This traceability element of the program helps to keep illegally fished seafood out of the supply chain by linking seafood sold in shops and restaurants to a certified sustainable fishery.\n\nThe MSC eco-label enables consumers to easily identify sustainable seafood when shopping or dining out. As of June 2014, there are over 14,000 MSC-labelled seafood products sold in over 90 countries around the world. The MSC website lists outlets selling MSC-certified seafood.\n\nThe six MSC certified Patagonian toothfish and Antarctic toothfish fisheries (which are the South Georgia, Ross Sea, Heard Island, Macquarie Island, Kerguelen Islands and Falkland Islands fisheries) provide a good example of how good fisheries management can reverse the trend of illegal fishing. These fisheries took significant steps to exclude illegal vessels from their waters:\n\n\nThese are only some of the measures taken by the toothfish fisheries to achieve MSC certification. Further information on each of these toothfish fisheries can be found on the MSC website.\n\nThe Responsible Fishing Scheme is the only global standard that audits compliance on board fishing vessels, including ethical and welfare criteria. First launched in 2006 by Seafish to help fishing vessels demonstrate their commitment to a responsibly sourced catch, in January 2016 a revised scheme was launched to include the health and safety and welfare of crew on board. The new scheme has been re-developed in accordance with the requirements of internationally recognised standard ISO17065. Initially focused on vessels supplying the UK market, the scheme will be rolled out internationally over the next two years. \n\nThe Responsible Fishing Scheme website has the most up to date information.\n\nSeafish is the UK's authority on seafood. It was founded in 1981 by an Act of Parliament and aims to support all sectors of the seafood industry for a sustainable, profitable and socially responsible future. It is the only pan-industry body offering services to all parts of the industry, from the start of the supply chain at catching and aquaculture; through processing, importers, exporters and distributors of seafood right through to restaurants and retailers. Seafish is funded by a levy on the first sale of seafood landed in the UK. Its services are intended to support and improve the environmental sustainability, efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the industry, as well as promoting responsibly-sourced seafood.\n\nIllegal and unreported fishing (two of the three components of IUU fishing) essentially arise from a failure to adequately enforce existing national and international laws. There are, however, many factors underlying enforcement failure, including, notably, poor levels of national governance.\n\nThere are obvious problems with enforcing fisheries regulations on the high seas, including locating and apprehending the pirate ships, but solutions are available, chiefly through improved monitoring and surveillance systems. \n\nMany fishermen are getting away with illegal, unreported, unregulated (IUU) ocean fishing due to the difficulty of monitoring every single fishing boat. This will begin to change with new technology that is able to watch and follow each boat from space consistently. This will be done through radio beacons, which all boats in the ocean are required to have. By implementing this new monitoring system, it will be impossible for fishermen to get away with IUU fishing in the future.\n\nMSC systems are similarly of value within exclusive economic zones, including, for example, offshore patrols and licensing schemes.\nUnder the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, states bear responsibility for the vessels (including fishing vessels) that fly their flag. While it is uncontroversial that individuals engaged in IUU fishing may be subject to legal sanctions, the extent to which flag states may be held liable under international law for the IUU fishing activities of their vessels is less clearly defined.\nIn March, 2013 the issue of flag state liability for IUU fishing was brought before the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea in a request for an advisory opinion submitted by the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission (SRFC) of West Africa. The SRFC asked the Tribunal to advise on the following four questions:\n\n\nIn its submissions to the Tribunal, the SRFC emphasized the severity of the IUU fishing problem in West Africa and the need for a clear regime of flag state responsibilities with respect to vessels engaged in this trade. The SRFC argued that its member states had been unable to mount successful prosecutions against IUU fishers following boardings due to a lack of support and cooperation from flag states.\nA number of states and international organizations also made submissions adopting a range positions with respect to the four questions above. It was held by some states that the Tribunal lacked the advisory jurisdiction to respond to these questions. Both the government of Spain, a major contributor to the problem of IUU fishing, as well as the United Kingdom adopted such a view. A number of other states took the position that flag state responsibility for IUU fishing should take the form of a general responsibility to perform due diligence with respect to vessels and their activities, rather than an obligation to assist in prosecutions or another more substantive requirement.\nIn its Advisory Opinion issued on April 2, 2015, the Tribunal adopted the “due diligence” approach. The Tribunal found that flag states are under only a general obligation to take the necessary measures to ensure that their nationals and vessels flying their flag are not engaged in IUU fishing activities. This obligation may be satisfied by adhering to generally accepted international norms of fishing vessel regulation and complying with international treaties that indicate best practices. At the same time, the Tribunal found that in coastal waters the coastal state bears primary responsibility for preventing IUU fishing and not the flag state.\n\nThe EU helped draw up FAO's international plan of action to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing, endorsed by the FAO Council in June 2001. The EU then developed its own plan to implement the commitments agreed at international level, and the European Commission‘s action plan for the eradication of IUU fishing was published in May 2002. It is intended to be implemented at four levels:\n\nAt the EU level, more responsibility will be requested with regard to member state nationals acting under a flag of convenience. Moreover, market measures concerning fisheries products caught in violation of the international agreements will be adopted. In addition, information actions addressed to the fishing industry, consumers, and the public will be launched to raise their awareness.\n\nIn the framework of Regional Fisheries Management Organisations, control and inspection plans would be adopted as well as specific conservation and management measures. In addition IUU vessels would be identified and monitored and their catches would be quantified.\n\nAt the international level, concepts like genuine link would be defined, and a number of rights and obligations of the port state would be established. Moreover, the exchange of information on IUU activities and the international co-operation would be strengthened.\n\nIn partnership with developing countries, the necessary means would be provided to enable them to effectively control fishing activities undertaken in waters under their jurisdiction.\n\nThe High Seas Task Force comprises a group of fisheries ministers and international NGOs working together to develop an action plan designed to combat IUU fishing on the high seas.\n\nLaunched in 2003, the Task Force includes fisheries ministers from Australia, Canada, Chile, Namibia, New Zealand and the UK, together with the Earth Institute, IUCN-World Conservation Union, WWF International and the Marine Stewardship Council.\n\nThe goal of the Task Force is to set priorities among a series of practical proposals for confronting the challenge of IUU fishing on the high seas. A series of expert panels have been convened to identify the legal, economic, scientific and enforcement factors that permit IUU activity to thrive, and then determine key points of leverage that can brought to bear at national, regional, and global levels to minimise the incentives to carry out IUU fishing on the high seas. The completed action plan, published on 3 March 2006, will be placed by ministerial members of the Task Force directly in the hands of other ministers.\n\nRegional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) are affiliations of nations that co-ordinate efforts to manage fisheries in a particular region.\n\nRFMOs may focus on certain species of fish (e.g. the Commission for the Conservation of Southern bluefin tuna) or have a wider remit related to living marine resources in general within a region (e.g. the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR)). This wide diversity of mandates and areas of application, and also effective implementation of regulations, opens up opportunities for IUU vessels.\n\nThe present system of high seas governance has evolved over a period of several hundred years, the end result being a patchwork quilt of measures in the form of binding and non-binding instruments with different geographical and legal reaches and different levels of participation.\n\nMost legal instruments build on the foundation established by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which was agreed in 1982 and entered into force in 1992.\n\nThe UN Fish Stocks Agreement, which entered into force in 2001, sets out principles for the conservation and management of fish stocks and establishes that such management must be based on the precautionary approach and the best available scientific information. The Agreement provides a framework for cooperation on conservation and management, but since only about a third of the parties to the Law of the Sea Convention have ratified it, its impact is inevitably limited.\n\nThe UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) carries out much of the technical work on international fisheries management, and provides a forum for the negotiation of agreements and codes of conduct. In 1995 the FAO agreed its Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries to promote long-term sustainable management.\n\nIn 2001, the FAO adopted the International Plan of Action (IPOA) on IUU Fishing. The aim of this voluntary instrument is to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing by providing all states with comprehensive, effective and transparent measures by which to act, including through appropriate regional fisheries management organisations established in accordance with international law.\n\nThe FAO Compliance Agreement, which entered into force in 2003, is designed to close a major loophole in international fisheries management, that of the circumvention of fisheries regulations by ‘re-flagging‘ vessels under the flags of states that are unable or unwilling to enforce such measures.\n\nIn 2009, the FAO brokered the Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing, which entered into force in 2016. The agreement closes ports to vessels suspected of illegal fishing. The treaty requires that fishing vessels request permission to dock and inform the port of the details of its fishing operations. Permission to dock can be denied if unregulated fishing was occurring. The measure is intended to block illegally caught fish from entering the marketplace. Other measures in the treaty include inspections of equipment, paperwork, catches, and ship's records. Though the treaty does not compel countries to apply these measures to ships under their own flags, they may choose to do so under the agreement.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5738417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5738417", "title": "Legal issues with fan fiction", "text": "Legal issues with fan fiction\n\nLegal issues with fan fiction arise due to the prospect that a piece of fan fiction may constitute a derivative work, most prominently (but not exclusively) under United States copyright law.\n\nSignificant amounts of copyrightable creative works such as motion pictures, television programs, music, and computer gaming works are produced in the United States. In addition, a significant amount of fan fiction is created in the United States. For these reasons, although every nation's law is different and different laws may apply to different works of fan fiction, U.S. law is often centrally relevant when determining the legality of writing and/or sharing fan fiction.\n\nUnder U.S. Copyright law, the legality of a given work of fan fiction will depend principally on three legal doctrines: (1) copyrightability of the underlying source work; (2) the derivative work right; and (3) fair use.\n\nTo have copyright protection under U.S. law, a work must be an \"original [work] of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression . . . from which [it] can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.\" Such works of authorship include but are not limited to literature, music, plays, pictures and architectural works. Copyright can not be applied to ideas, concepts, facts or other broad principles regardless of whether they are expressed in a tangible medium or otherwise. Copyright goes into effect automatically, even if a work is not published. For works created in 1978 or later, copyright protection persists for the life of the author plus 70 years; in the case of an anonymous work, a pseudonymous work, or a work made for hire, the copyright endures for a term of 95 years from publication, or for 120 years from the year of its creation, whichever expires first.\n\nAccording to current United States copyright, copyright owners have the exclusive right \"to prepare derivative works based upon [their] copyrighted work.\" A derivative work is any work, including fanfiction based upon one or more preexisting works. In the case where a copyright owner chooses to exercise his/her exclusive right to prepare derivative works against a work of fanfiction, s/he can sue the fanfiction writer for copyright infringement. To prove infringement, an owner must present evidence establishing that the accused has copied protected elements of the original work. The possible remedies available if infringement can be proven include an order to cease sharing and/or to destroy the work (known as an injunction), or monetary damages. The remedy is dependent on the harm done to the copyright owner, the intent of the infringing person, and the grievousness of the infringement. An example of injunction as remedy was seen in the case of \"Anderson v. Stallone\". There, Sylvester Stallone successfully pursued an action for copyright infringement against Anderson, an author who wrote a proposed script for \"Rocky IV,\" by proving that the copyright-protected characters used in the previous Rocky movies were central to the new script. The court enjoined Anderson from pursuing the creation of a movie or other published work based on his script.\n\nFanfiction is not infringing if it constitutes fair use of the underlying copyrighted work. In determining whether a particular use constitutes fair use, courts consider the following four factors:\n\nFair use is assessed on a case-by-case basis. While such genres as parody and criticism are enumerated by statute and case law as presumptively fair uses of a copyrighted work, fan fiction has not historically been recognized by U.S. courts as necessarily constituting these or other enumerated fair use genres, and thus neither falls categorically inside nor categorically outside the presumptive boundaries of fair use. Works of fanfiction are more likely to constitute fair use if they are \"transformative\" with respect to the original work, if they are non-commercial, if they appropriate relatively little of the original work, and/or if they do not tend to detract from the potential market for or value of the original work.\n\nIn a 2009 case, United States District Court judge Deborah A. Batts permanently prohibited publication in the United States of a book by Swedish writer Fredrik Colting, whose protagonist is a 76-year-old version of Holden Caulfield of J.D. Salinger's \"The Catcher in the Rye\". Judge Batts explicitly rejected arguments of parody and criticism, stating,\nTo the extent Defendants contend that 60 Years and the character of Mr. C direct parodic comment or criticism at \"Catcher\" or Holden Caulfield, as opposed to Salinger himself, the Court finds such contentions to be post-hoc rationalizations employed through vague generalizations about the alleged naivety of the original, rather than reasonably perceivable parody.\n\nThe case was vacated and remanded by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit with orders to apply the \"eBay v. MercExchange\" test in determining whether publication of a work can be prohibited on a theory of intellectual property infringement before the case has gone to trial. The case was settled in 2011, with Colting agreeing to cease distribution. \n\nIn contrast, in \"Suntrust v. Houghton Mifflin Co.\", the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit vacated a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction sought by the copyright holders of Margaret Mitchell's \"Gone With the Wind\" against Alice Randall's \"The Wind Done Gone\". In determining whether Randall's work rose to the level of transformative, Circuit Judge Birch used the guidelines for transformative works laid out in the Supreme Court's \"Campbell v. Acuff Rose Music\". Birch found Randall's work to be transformative because it \"[provided] social benefit, by shedding light on an earlier work, and, in the process, creating a new one.\" \"Campbell\" had already established that the greater the transformative value a work held, the less important the other factors in the fair use test became. Despite Randall and Houghton Mifflin having released \"The Wind Done Gone\" as a commercial work, and Randall having used a substantial portion of Mitchell's work in her own, Birch found that the highly transformative nature of Randall's book overcame the other prongs of the fair use test.\n\nSeparate from the legal issues raised by fanfiction’s interaction with copyright law, legal issues may also develop from United States trademark law.\n\nCurrent federal trademark law follows the Lanham Act, otherwise known as the Trademark Act of 1946. Under the Lanham Act, a trademark is \"any word, term, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof\" used in commerce to identify a service or good. Under this definition, it is possible for the names and likenesses of television, film and book characters, fictional settings, or other elements of entertainment products to act as trademarks. Unlike copyright, however, trademark rights are not automatic. To establish a right in trademark, the rights-seeker must establish that his/her mark acts as a distinctive \"source identifier\" for a particular type of good or service. Thus, trademark rights may arise when a fictional character’s name or likeness may serve to identify the source of an entertainment product or related good. For example, the use of Mickey Mouse’s name or likeness may serve to identify a particular book or toy as originating from Disney. One way to establish that a mark acts as a distinctive source identifier is to establish that the relevant purchasing public has developed a strong association between the mark and its originating source. In legal terms, this is known as \"secondary meaning.\"\n\nIf the trademark holder can show that its creation acts as a distinctive source identifier, s/he still must prove a likelihood of confusion to prevail in a trademark infringement claim. Different courts consider similar but not identical factors when deciding likelihood of confusion. Common factors that may be relevant to fanfiction include:\n\n\nThe courts can weigh the factors in individual cases, and may consider additional factors as they please.\n\nTo the extent that fanfiction uses source-identifying characters, settings and such, the marks are often well known are identical to the original, and are used in similar types of goods (i.e., written fiction). In this way, the first three factors relayed here weigh for the trademark holder.\n\nHowever, fanfiction writers generally do not intend to deceive the consuming public as to the source of the work, and often include prominent disclaimers at the outset of their works stating that the works are not the products of the original creators, both to honor the original creator and to prevent any possible confusion as to source. In addition, as a consuming audience, fanfiction readers are generally sophisticated regarding works' status as fanfiction, and are aware that fanfiction is not written or endorsed by those who hold the trademarks. As such, the last three factors tend to weigh in the direction of fanfiction writers.\n\nTrademark holders may also allege that the use of trademarked characters, settings, etc. may constitute trademark dilution. The concept of trademark dilution is that overuse or improper use of a mark, even when it does not create consumer confusion, can lessen the mark’s uniqueness and value as a source identifier. A dilution claim requires that the mark in question be famous throughout general consuming public and that the use of the mark create a likelihood of either \"blurring\" or \"tarnishment.\" A likelihood of blurring occurs when the use of the mark creates an association that is likely to impair the distinctiveness of the famous mark; a likelihood of tarnishment occurs when the use of the mark creates an association that is likely to harm the reputation of the famous mark.\n\nEven if a likelihood of confusion or dilution were found, trademark law provides various defenses to alleged infringement. These defenses fall into the categories of \"fair use\" and \"First Amendment.\"\n\nTrademark \"fair use\" differs significantly from fair use under copyright law. In trademark law there are two types of fair use: descriptive and nominative use. Descriptive fair use permits the use of a descriptive mark in a descriptive way; for example, an advertisement could say that a particular dress shoe \"feels like a sneaker\" even though the phrase \"Looks like a pump, feels like a sneaker\" is the trademark of another company. Nominative fair use permits the use of a mark to identify the product that bears that mark, when (1) the product or service in question is not readily identifiable without use of the trademark; (2) no more of the mark is used than is reasonably necessary to identify the product or service; and (3) the user does nothing beyond use of the mark that would suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder. For example, a news story about the New Kids on the Block can use the mark \"New Kids on the Block\" to identify the band. Nominative fair use is often particularly relevant to fanfiction, since a fanfiction writer’s use of trademarked names, settings, etc. to identify characters, story settings, etc. will generally meet the three requirements for nominative fair use. For this reason, fanfiction is harder to succeed on than an allegation of copyright infringement.\n\nAn additional defense to trademark infringement or dilution relies on the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech.\n\nCourts have shown reluctance to curtail creative uses of trademarks in expressive works. For example, in \"Mattel v. MCA Records\", United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit permitted the band Aqua’s use of Mattel’s trademark in \"Barbie\" to sell songs, that MCA had a valid parody defense, as Aqua needed to use the word \"Barbie\" in its song \"Barbie Girl,\" based on the fact that the use of the mark was (1) artistically relevant to the song and (2) not explicitly misleading as to the source of the song. Because there was a relatively small likelihood of confusion, the Ninth Circuit held that the First Amendment protected Aqua’s use of the mark. The First Amendment defense has not stood up where the trademark holder was able to prove the existence of significant actual confusion. An example of this is a parodic publication running a parody ad for a product, and the parody not being well done enough or labeled clearly enough for people to realize it is not a real ad.\n\nBecause of these differences in the legal doctrines of trademark and copyright, trademark law is less likely to come into conflict with fanfiction.\n\nA brief note on non-U.S. perspectives: while other countries do not necessarily weigh the interests of trademark owners and other speakers in the same way, noncommercial and expressive uses may receive protection under other nations' laws as well. For example, in South Africa, a T-shirt company was able to sell T-shirts parodying Black Label beer.\n\nMany countries, and some U.S. States, have laws governing rights of publicity. In the United States, rights of publicity are governed by state statutes and state common law, and thus vary from state to state. As a general matter, the right of publicity grants a right to famous persons to control the commercial use of their \"name, image and likeness,\" and sometimes extends to one’s broader identity or persona. The case of \"White v. Samsung\" provides an example of the right of publicity protecting a celebrity’s persona even when her name and likeness were not used: Samsung created an ad that pictured a robot in a blond wig and a red dress, in a pose that evoked Vanna White’s work on \"Wheel of Fortune\". White prevailed under California law on the theory that although Samsung had not used her name or likeness. Samsung had used a recognizable depiction of her persona without permission for their commercial gain. Arguably, celebrities whose names, images, likenesses or personas are used in real person fiction, have the right to assert claims against fanfiction authors based on rights of publicity.\n\nTo date, though, no recorded right of publicity suits have been brought regarding noncommercial fan fiction about real persons. This may be, in part, because most states’ right of publicity laws only apply to uses for commercial gain. Despite the ruling in \"White\", courts have shown hesitation in other suits to shut down even commercial artistic pursuits based on the right of publicity. Some courts have relied heavily on Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski's strong dissent from the \"White\" decision in order to deny a \"Right of Publicity\" claim. Others have relied directly on the First Amendment. In \"ETW v. Jireh\", the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit rejected a right of publicity claim brought by Tiger Woods against an artist who depicted Woods and other golf legends, holding that the transformative nature of the work exempted it from right of publicity liability under the First Amendment. In contrast, in \"Parks v. LaFace\", the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that the Outkast song \"Rosa Parks\" violated the civil rights icon’s right of publicity because it was not sufficiently transformative. The court explained that the use of a name or likeness is not transformative for right of publicity purposes when it \"is used solely to attract attention to a work that is not related to the identified person.\" Based on these cases, it is not clear that a court would be willing to abridge free speech by holding that fictional writing about a real person constitutes a violation of that person’s right of publicity.\n\nIn 2007 two UC Davis Law School professors argued in the \"California Law Review\" that \"Mary Sue\" fan fiction \"that challenge the orthodoxy of the original likely constitute fair use\". Citing \"Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.\"—which established that commercial parody can qualify as fair use if it can be perceived as commenting or criticizing on the original—and the subsequent \"Suntrust v. Houghton Mifflin\", the authors wrote that \"Similarly, many Mary Sues comment on or criticize the original, while at the same time create something new ... Mary Sues can be commercial and still be fair.\"\n\nThat year, a group of fans who engage in creating fan works and are part of the larger fan community founded the Organization for Transformative Works (OTW). OTW has since advocated the legitimacy of fan fiction due its transformative nature. OTW's position is that fan fiction and other fan labor products constitute copyright fair use under 17 U.S.C. § 107 because they add \"new meaning and messages to the original\" work, and thus fall under the exemption to U.S. copyright law the Supreme Court defined in \"Campbell\" and which was later revisited and followed in \"Suntrust\". OTW's vision includes seeing \"all fannish works recognized as legal and transformative and ... accepted as a legitimate creative activity.\" Toward this end OTW works to educate fan writers and published writers about copyright laws, particularly the open legal questions around fan fiction and other fan works.\n\nOTW also maintains its own fan fiction archive, the Archive of Our Own, commonly called AO3. All fan fiction on the site is recognized as non-profit derivative works. While OTW provides a centralized netspace for fans to acquire knowledge and aid regarding their own creative works, and a voice for the fan community, it does not represent all fans. Fans have many different views on the legalities of fan works, from the pure question of whether these works are transformative, to differences in how fans feel fan works should be disseminated.\n\nFan writers who argue that their work is legal through the fair use doctrine use specific fair use arguments in the context of fan works, such as:\n\nOTW is also not the only organization to support the idea that fan works are transformative. In \"Salinger v. Colting\", the \"New York Times\" and other major media conglomerates filed an amicus brief supporting Colting's book, as did the Library Copyright Alliance.\n\nSome copyright holders have stated specific positive or negative attitudes towards fanfiction.\n\nMost major studios and production companies tolerate fan fiction, and some even encourage it to a certain extent. Paramount Pictures, for example, allowed the production of \"\" and \"\" from Bantam Books, fan fiction anthologies which followed Bantam's \"Star Trek Lives!\" by reprinting stories from various fanzines; as well as \"\", a series of ten anthologies from Pocket Books in which the short stories were selected through an open submissions process geared toward novice writers.\n\nDue to the ongoing nature of television production, some television producers have implemented constraints, one example being \"Babylon 5\" creator J. Michael Straczynski. His demand that \"Babylon 5\" fan fiction be clearly labeled or kept off the Internet confined most of the \"Babylon 5\" fan fiction community to mailing lists during the show's initial run.\n\nMany writers and producers state that they do not read fan fiction, citing a fear of being accused of stealing a fan's ideas, but encourage its creation nonetheless. When \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" went off the air, for instance, creator Joss Whedon encouraged fans to read fan fiction during the show's timeslot.\n\nWhile many authors, (\"e.g.\" Neil Gaiman, J.K. Rowling, D.J. MacHale, Stephenie Meyer, Terry Pratchett) do not take issue with authors of derivative works, a number of authors do. They may request that fan fiction archival sites remove and ban any pieces of fan fiction based on their original works. To date, no fan fiction archive has failed to comply with an author’s request to remove works, and many archives feature a full list of authors whose work cannot be the source of a fan fiction on their site.\n\nFan fiction hosting sites like MediaMiner and Fanfiction.net have lists of authors whose fandoms are prohibited from their sites. MediaMinder states, \"This is a right they [the copyright owner] have as an author or owner of the work. No copyright owner has to allow fan fiction or even tolerate it.\" Fanlore has a list of Professional Author Fanfic Policies that includes authors who support and authors who discourage fan fiction of their works.\n\nJ. K. Rowling has also complained about sexually explicit Harry Potter fan fiction. However, lawyers on behalf of Ms. Rowling specifically noted that she has \"no complaint about innocent fan fiction written by genuine Harry Potter fans\" and she \"is happy for spin-offs to be published online as long as the publications are not sold and it is made clear she was not involved in the stories\", under the condition that they do not contain pornography or racism.\n\nIn 2008, Steven Brust published a Firefly novel with a CC copyright notice.\n\nNoteworthy in regard to the acceptance of fan fiction is Eric Flint, who has set up a formal site for the submission of fan fiction into his canon in the \"1632\" series at Baen's Bar and has to date (March 2015) published 58 issues of \"The Grantville Gazette\" in electronic form and six in book form. These feature fan fiction and fan non-fiction alongside his original work (paying first semi-pro, and now SFWA rates). Flint (a former labor organizer and socialist) contends that this collective work allows the expansion of his alternate history universe into something approaching the complexity of reality. It can be argued, however, that since work published in the \"Gazette\" is paid (at professional rates) and cleared by Flint for canonicity, that this is not actually \"fan fiction\" in the commonly-understood sense of the term.\n\nAlso noteworthy is the series of \"Darkover\" anthologies published by Marion Zimmer Bradley, beginning in 1980, consisting largely of fan fiction extended into her canon. These books led to a much talked about controversy. Bradley read something in a fan story that meshed well with a Darkover book she was currently writing, so she wrote the fan author, Jean Lamb, offering her \"a sum and a dedication for all rights to the text.\" In a 1991 Usenet post, Jean continued, \"I attempted at that point to _very politely_ negotiate a better deal. I was told that I had better take what I was offered, that much better authors than I had not been paid as much (we're talking a few hundred dollars here) and had gotten the same sort of 'credit' (this was in the summer of 1992)...a few\nmonths later I received a letter from Ms. Bradley's lawyer threatening me with\na suit.\"After Bradley's death, more information has come out supporting the fan's story. The rumor, however, was that Bradley had a skirmish with a fan who claimed authorship of a book identical to one Bradley had published and accused Bradley of \"stealing\" the idea, and the resultant lawsuit cost Bradley a book. Either way, her attorney advised her against reading fan fiction of her work. Versions of this incident are credited by many to have led to a \"zero tolerance\" policy on the part of a number of other professional authors, including Andre Norton, and David Weber. Mercedes Lackey used to strictly disallow any posting of fan fiction set within in her universes on the Internet, though she did allow stories to be published in approved fanzines with signed releases for each story. Recently, she has changed her stance to allow nonprofit fan fiction of her works so long as the fan fiction is licensed as a derivative work and uses a Creative Commons license.\n\nAnne Rice objected to fan fiction based on any of her characters (mostly those from her famous \"Interview with the Vampire\" and its sequels in \"The Vampire Chronicles\") or other elements in her books, and she formally requested that FanFiction.Net remove stories featuring her characters. However, in 2012, \"Metro\" reported that Rice has taken a milder stance on the issue: \"I got upset about 20 years ago because I thought it would block me,\" she said. \"However, it’s been very easy to avoid reading any, so live and let live. If I were a young writer, I’d want to own my own ideas. But maybe fan fiction is a transitional phase: whatever gets you there, gets you there.\" Similar efforts have also been taken by Annette Curtis Klause, Robin Hobb, George R.R. Martin, and Robin McKinley among others. Many authors do this, they state, in order to protect their copyright and especially to prevent any dilution, saturation, or distortion of the universes and people portrayed in their works.\n\nSharon Lee and Steve Miller, creators of the Liaden universe, strongly oppose fan fiction written in their universe. \"I don’t want “other people interpreting” our characters. Interpreting our characters is what Steve and I do; it’s our job. Nobody else is going to get it right. This may sound rude and elitist, but honestly, it’s not easy for us to get it right sometimes, and we’ve been living with these characters. . .for a very long time... We built our universes, and our characters; they are our intellectual property; and they are not toys lying about some virtual sandbox for other kids to pick up and modify at their whim. Steve and I do not sanction fanfic written in our universes; any such work that exists, exists without our permission, and certainly without our support.\"\n\nIn an author's note in \"The Ringworld Engineers\", Larry Niven stated that he was finished writing stories in the \"Known Space\" universe, and that \"[i]f you want more \"Known Space\" stories, you'll have to write them yourself.\" Internet writer Elf Sternberg took him up on that offer, penning a parody in which members of Niven's hyper-masculine Kzin species engage in gay sex and BDSM. Niven responded by denouncing Sternberg's story in the introduction to \"Man-Kzin Wars IV\" (Baen Books, 1991) and issuing a cease-and-desist for copyright violation. To date, Sternberg holds that the story is constitutionally protected parody, while Niven maintains that it is a copyright violation that lies outside of protected speech, though he has not legally pursued the matter further.\n\nSome authors have said that they wrote fan fiction before they were published, or are pro-fan fiction. Naomi Novik has mentioned writing fanfic for television series and movies, and says she'd be thrilled to know that fans were writing fanfic for her series (though she also said she'd be careful not to read any of it); Anne McCaffrey allowed fan fiction, but had a page of rules she expected her fans to follow; Anne Harris has said, \"I live for the day my characters get slashed\"; Tamora Pierce stated on her website that she began writing Lord of the Rings and Star Trek fanfiction and has no issue with fanfictions based on her works, provided they are non-profit. Author Cassandra Clare was a popular Harry Potter fanfiction author before she published her first novel.\n\nCopyright holders may have been changing their policies towards fan fiction.\nSome companies like CBS and Lucasfilm Ltd., which had been historically hostile to fan fiction, changed parts of their model in order to be more fan friendly. This included trying to encourage fan works and integrating them into official sites.\n\nWhen not hosting the fan fiction or being openly tolerant of existing fan sites, companies created partnerships with other companies like FanLib to aid them in the task. The reaction from fans to such alliances and interference in their activities has been mixed, with some people thinking that it violates the basic rules of fan fiction communities. Those fans seem to be increasingly in the minority, as acceptance of such interference is tolerated because of the positives that can result.\n\nThe attitude of copyright holders toward incorporating fan fiction into the canon varies. Some copyright holders, such as the BBC in the case of \"Doctor Who\", have mechanisms to allow for unsolicited submissions of stories into the official canon, and it is also the case that the writers of canon stories have sometimes been recruited from the ranks of fan fiction writers. In the case of the \"Doctor Who\" novels published by Virgin Books, once the BBC reclaimed the license to publish novels regarding the Doctor, many readers immediately categorized all the Virgin New Adventures as non-canonical fan fiction.\n\nIn Great Britain, \"Discworld\" author Terry Pratchett, up until the point of his death in 2015, emphasized that he was careful not to read fanfics, and had voiced the opinion that \"everything works if people are sensible\" and didn't mind \"so long as people don't put it where I can trip over it\". However, Pratchett emphasized that the Discworld and all its characters are ultimately his intellectual property, and stressed that \"it is not a franchise\".\n\nNeil Gaiman, another English author who has written such works as \"Stardust\", \"Coraline\", and \"American Gods\", says he does not mind fan fiction as long as the author notes that the characters are the intellectual property of another and so long as the fiction is not for profit.\n\nIn addition, fanfiction is legal in the UK following passage into law of an exception to copyright for the purpose of caricature, parody, or pastiche.\n\nIn countries such as Russia and China, where copyright laws are more lenient or less well enforced, it is not uncommon to see fan fiction based on the work of popular authors published in book form. Sergey Lukyanenko, a popular science fiction author, went as far as to incorporate some fan fiction based on his stories into official canon (with permission of the writers of the said fan fiction). Perhaps the most famous case, however, is Dmitri Yemets' \"Tanya Grotter\" book series, a \"cultural response\" to \"Harry Potter\", which provoked a lawsuit from J. K. Rowling.\n\nIn Japan, the \"dōjinshi\" subculture is similar to a combination of the United States subcultures surrounding underground comics, science fiction fanzines, and fan fiction. The dōjinshi artists rarely secure the permission of the original creator. Many \"dōjinshi\" works are manga-format fan fiction, which in Japan is, while not strictly legal, generally tolerated and usually encouraged, being looked upon as a form of free advertising or a breeding ground for new talent, most famously the group CLAMP and Love Hina author Ken Akamatsu.\n\n\n"}

An offense that is \"malum prohibitum\" may not appear on the face to directly violate moral standards. The distinction between these two cases is discussed in \"State of Washington v. Thaddius X. Anderson\":\nCriminal offenses can be broken down into two general categories \"malum in se\" and \"malum prohibitum\". The distinction between \"malum in se\" and \"malum prohibitum\" offenses is best characterized as follows: a \"malum in se\" offense is \"naturally evil as adjudged by the sense of a civilized community,\" whereas a \"malum prohibitum\" offense is wrong only because a statute makes it so. \"State v. Horton\", 139 N.C. 588, 51 S.E. 945, 946 (1905).\"Public welfare offenses\" are a subset of \"malum prohibitum\" offenses as they are typically regulatory in nature and often \"'result in no direct or immediate injury to person or property but merely create the danger or probability of it which the law seeks to minimize.'\" \"Bash\", 130 Wn.2d at 607 (quoting \"Morissette v.

{"id": "56667439", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56667439", "title": "Mechanisms of the English common law", "text": "Mechanisms of the English common law\n\nIn the English system of common law, judges have devised a number of mechanisms to allow them to cope with precedent decisions.\n\nAccording to Montesquieu, it is Parliament that has the rightful power to legislate, not the judiciary. The legal fiction is that judges do not make law, they merely \"declare it\". Thus, common law is declaratory, and this is often retrospective in effect. For example, see \"Shaw v DPP\" and \"R v Knuller\" In the search for justice and fairness, there is a tension between the needs for, on one hand, predictability and stability, and \"up-to date law\", on the other.\n\nThere is a hierarchy of courts, and a hierarchy of decisions. All lower courts are bound by the judgments from higher courts; and higher courts are not bound by decisions from lower courts.\nWith one exception, courts of record are bound by their own precedent decisions. The House of Lords used to be bound by its own decisions, but in 1966 it issued a Practice Direction declaring that it would no longer feel so constrained; the Supreme Court is similarly free to depart from earlier decisions. By contrast, the Court of Appeal is bound by its own decisions, although for a period Lord Denning, MR, acted as though it were not. Inferior courts are not strictly courts of record, but some, such as employment tribunals methodically report their own cases, and have built up a specialist body of common law. Courts such as the magistrates court cannot establish precedent.\n\nEven if a court is bound to observe a precedent decision, it does not follow that the whole of the judgment is binding. One must distinguish between \"ratio decidendi\" and \"obiter dicta\". \"Ratio decidendi\" is the \"reason for the decision\", and forms the crux of the cases; whereas \"obiter dicta\" is \"other things that are said\", i.e. matters said in passing, judicial asides, hypothetical issues, and broad issues. \"Ratio decidendi\" is binding on other courts, whereas \"obiter dicta\" is persuasive only.\n\nAn effective test to see if a part of the judgment is \"ratio\" or \"obiter\" is \"Wambaugh's Inversion Test\", whereby one must invert the question, and ask, \"would the decision have been different without this part of the judgment?\". In other words, ask, \"Is it crucial?\". If not, it is \"obiter dicta\".\n\nIf a judgment establishes a broad principle of law, then strictly speaking that principle is too wide to be said to be \"ratio decidendi\". Nevertheless, if that broad principle is approved and applied by later courts, then the principle will eventually be treated as \"ratio\". A particular example is the broad \"neighbour principle\", enunciated by Lord Atkin in \"Donoghue v Stevenson\" 1932, which has become the basis of the modern law of negligence. When judges may face conflicting precedents, they may select the preferable case.\n\nDissenting judgments are not \"ratio\", and so must be \"obiter\". Sometimes, with the passage of time, more attention is given to the dissenting judgment that to the majority judgment. Scottish decisions (and decisions from the USA and common law jurisdictions in the Commonwealth) are, like \"obiter dicta\", merely persuasive in England.\n\nIf faced with a binding judicial precedent, a court has a number of ways to respond to it, and may use the following legal devices and mechanisms:\n\n"}

{"id": "22197", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22197", "title": "Open content", "text": "Open content\n\nOpen content is a neologism coined by David Wiley in 1998 which describes a creative work that others can copy or modify freely, without asking for permission. The term evokes the related concept of open-source software. Such content is said to be under an open licence.\n\nOriginally, the Open content concept was invented by Michael Stutz, who in 1994 wrote the paper \"Applying Copyleft to Non-Software Information\" for the GNU Project. The \"Open Content\" term was later evangelized via the \"Open Content Project\" by David A. Wiley in 1998, and described works licensed under the Open Content License (a non-free share-alike license, see 'Free content' below) and other works licensed under similar terms.\n\nIt has since come to describe a broader class of content without conventional copyright restrictions. The openness of content can be assessed under the '5Rs Framework' based on the extent to which it can be reused, revised, remixed and redistributed by members of the public without violating copyright law. Unlike free content and content under open-source licenses, there is no clear threshold that a work must reach to qualify as 'open content'.\n\nAlthough open content has been described as a counterbalance to copyright, open content licenses rely on a copyright holder's power to license their work, similarly as copyleft which also utilizes copyright for such a purpose.\n\nIn 2003 Wiley announced that the Open Content Project has been succeeded by Creative Commons and their licenses, where he joined as \"Director of Educational Licenses\".\n\nIn 2006 the Creative Commons' successor project was the \"Definition of Free Cultural Works\" for free content, put forth by Erik Möller, Richard Stallman, Lawrence Lessig, Benjamin Mako Hill, Angela Beesley, and others. The \"Definition of Free Cultural Works\" is used by the Wikimedia Foundation. In 2008, the Attribution and Attribution-ShareAlike Creative Commons licenses were marked as \"Approved for Free Cultural Works\" among other licenses.\nAnother successor project is the \"Open Knowledge Foundation\" (\"OKF\"), founded by Rufus Pollock in Cambridge, UK in 2004 as a global non-profit network to promote and share open content and data. In 2007 the Open Knowledge Foundation gave an \"Open Knowledge Definition\" for \"Content such as music, films, books; Data be it scientific, historical, geographic or otherwise; Government and other administrative information\". In October 2014 with version 2.0 \"Open Works\" and \"Open Licenses\" were defined and \"open\" is described as synonymous to the definitions of open/free in the Open Source Definition, the Free Software Definition and the Definition of Free Cultural Works. A distinct difference is the focus given to the public domain and that it focuses also on the accessibility (\"open access\") and the readability (\"open formats\"). Among several conformant licenses, six are recommended, three own (Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and Licence (PDDL), Open Data Commons Attribution License (ODC-BY), Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL)) and the CC BY, CC BY-SA, and CC0 creative commons licenses.\n\nThe OpenContent website once defined OpenContent as 'freely available for modification, use and redistribution under a license similar to those used by the open-source / free software community'. However, such a definition would exclude the Open Content License (OPL) because that license forbade charging 'a fee for the [OpenContent] itself', a right required by free and open-source software licenses.\n\nThe term since shifted in meaning. OpenContent \"is licensed in a manner that provides users with free and perpetual permission to engage in the 5R activities.\"\n\nThe 5Rs are put forward on the OpenContent website as a framework for assessing the extent to which content is open:\n\nThis broader definition distinguishes open content from open-source software, since the latter must be available for commercial use by the public. However, it is similar to several definitions for open educational resources, which include resources under noncommercial and verbatim licenses.\n\nThe later \"Open Definition\" by the Open Knowledge Foundation (now known as Open Knowledge International) define open knowledge with open content and open data as sub-elements and draws heavily on the Open Source Definition; it preserves the limited sense of open content as free content, unifying both.\n\n\"Open access\" refers to toll-free or gratis access to content, mainly published originally peer-reviewed scholarly journals. Some open access works are also licensed for reuse and redistribution (\"libre open access\"), which would qualify them as open content.\n\nOver the past decade, open content has been used to develop alternative routes towards higher education. Traditional universities are expensive, and their tuition rates are increasing. Open content allows a free way of obtaining higher education that is \"focused on collective knowledge and the sharing and reuse of learning and scholarly content.\"\nThere are multiple projects and organizations that promote learning through open content, including OpenCourseWare Initiative, The Saylor Foundation and Khan Academy. Some universities, like MIT, Yale, and Tufts are making their courses freely available on the internet.\n\nThe textbook industry is one of the educational industries in which open content can make the biggest impact. Traditional textbooks, aside from being expensive, can also be inconvenient and out of date, because of publishers' tendency to constantly print new editions. Open textbooks help to eliminate this problem, because they are online and thus easily updatable. Being openly licensed and online can be helpful to teachers, because it allows the textbook to be modified according to the teacher's unique curriculum. There are multiple organizations promoting the creation of openly licensed textbooks. Some of these organizations and projects include The University of Minnesota's Open Textbook Library, Connexions, OpenStax College, The Saylor Foundation Open Textbook Challenge and Wikibooks\n\nAccording to the current definition of open content on the OpenContent website, any general, royalty-free copyright license would qualify as an open license because it 'provides users with the right to make more kinds of uses than those normally permitted under the law. These permissions are granted to users free of charge.'\n\nHowever, the narrower definition used in the Open Definition effectively limits open content to libre content, any free content license, defined by the Definition of Free Cultural Works, would qualify as an open content license. According to this narrower criteria, the following still-maintained licenses qualify:\n\n(For more licenses see Open Knowledge, Free content and Free Cultural Works licenses)\n\n\n"}

On 14 October 2011, the Platform of European Memory and Conscience, an EU educational project to raise awareness about totalitarian crimes and to combat intolerance, extremism, and anti-democratic movements, was established by the governments of the Visegrád Group and a number of European government institutions and NGOs, as an initiative of the Polish EU presidency and following decisions by the European Parliament and the EU Council supporting the project.\n\nThe declaration concluded the conference European Conscience and Communism, an international conference that took place at the Czech Senate from 2 to 3 June 2008, hosted by the Senate Committee on Education, Science, Culture, Human Rights and Petitions, under the auspices of Alexandr Vondra, Deputy Prime Minister of the Czech Republic for European Affairs, and organised by Jana Hybášková MEP and Senator Martin Mejstřík in co-operation with the Office of the Government of the Czech Republic, the Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes and the European People's Party's Robert Schuman Foundation.\n\nThe conference on European Conscience and Communism received letters of support from president Nicolas Sarkozy (France), Lady Margaret Thatcher (UK), Secretary of State Jason Kenney (Canada) and former National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski (United States).\n\nThe declaration was preceded by the European Public Hearing on Crimes Committed by Totalitarian Regimes. The declaration is part of a wider process at the European and international level, aimed at reaching similar objectives to those stated in the declaration.\n\nCentral to the declaration is the call for an \"all-European understanding that both the Nazi and Communist totalitarian regimes [...] should be considered to be the main disasters, which blighted the 20th century.\" The declaration or its proposals have received support from the European Parliament, notably in its 2009 resolution on European conscience and totalitarianism, from other bodies of the European Union, from the governments of multiple European countries affected by communist totalitarian rule and Soviet occupation, and from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.\n\nThe declaration called for:\n\nThe Declaration cites Council of Europe resolution 1481 as well as \"resolutions on Communist crimes adopted by a number of national parliaments.\" The Declaration was preceded by the European Public Hearing on Crimes Committed by Totalitarian Regimes.\n\nThe founding signatories included:\n\n\nThe Declaration was subsequently also signed by around 50 members of the European Parliament and other politicians from around the world, including Els de Groen, Ģirts Valdis Kristovskis, György Schöpflin, Gisela Kallenbach, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Michael Gahler, Zuzana Roithová, Inese Vaidere, Hans-Josef Fell, Nickolay Mladenov, József Szájer, Peter Stastny, Ari Vatanen, Wojciech Roszkowski, László Tőkés, Charlotte Cederschiöld, László Surján, and Milan Zver.\n\nThe Declaration was also signed by Lee Edwards (Chairman of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation), Asparoukh Panov (Vice-President of the Liberal International), poet and civil rights activist Natalya Gorbanevskaya, philosopher André Glucksmann, and former Yugoslav dissident Ljubo Sirc.\n\nFollowing its announcement, a number of political developments have taken place relating to the issues raised in the Prague Declaration. These developments have been referred to as the \"Prague Process\" by the Reconciliation of European Histories Group, an all-party group in the European Parliament chaired by Sandra Kalniete.\n\nThe European Parliament proclaimed the European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism on 23 September 2008 with the support of 409 MEPs from all political factions and called for its implementation by the member states in its 2009 resolution on European conscience and totalitarianism (adopted 533–44 with 33 abstentions), which also called for the establishment of the Platform of European Memory and Conscience. Co-sponsored by the European People's Party, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, The Greens–European Free Alliance, and the Union for Europe of the Nations, the resolution called for the recognition of \"Communism, Nazism and fascism as a shared legacy\" and \"an honest and thorough debate on all the totalitarian crimes of the past century,\" reconfirmed \"its united stand against all totalitarian rule from whatever ideological background,\" and condemned \"strongly and unequivocally all crimes against humanity and the massive human rights violations committed by all totalitarian and authoritarian regimes.\"\n\nOn 18 September 2008, The Greens–European Free Alliance hosted a public hearing in the European Parliament on \"Totalitarian Regimes and the opening of the secret files archives in Central and Eastern Europe,\" based on the Prague Declaration, and organised by MEPs Milan Horáček and Gisela Kallenbach. The official program stated that: \"The Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism should be the common basis for the research on and evaluation of communist regimes in all countries in East-Europe.\"\n\nOn 18 September 2008, the Bulgarian Parliament officially endorsed the Prague Declaration.\n\nOn 18 March 2009, the Czech Presidency of the Council of the European Union in co-operation with MEPs supporting the Prague Declaration hosted the , as \"the third step towards the establishment of a European platform of memory and conscience to support the activities of institutions engaged in reconciling with totalitarian regimes in Europe.\" The conclusions called for \"the establishment of the Platform of European Memory and Conscience\" and supported the proclamation of the European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism.\n\nSimilar proposals to those of the Prague Declaration received support in the European Parliament, which adopted a 2009 resolution on European conscience and totalitarianism.\n\nOn 25 April 2009, the European Democrat Students adopted a resolution, stating that \"we, the European Democrat Students, support the Prague Declaration to its full extent and take on the integration of the content to our general policy.\" The organisation stated that \"communism as a totalitarian regime [...] can only distinct itself from Fascism and Nazism by a more recent expiry date and the consequent damage over time it was able to cause.\"\n\nOn 28 April 2009, the governments of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were thanked by the President of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert Pöttering, for their efforts to better inform western Europe on the totalitarianism of the Soviet Union. Pöttering brought up the classic study on totalitarianism by Hannah Arendt, which developed \"the scientific basis criteria to describe totalitarianism,\" concluding that \"both totalitarian systems (Stalinism and Nazism) are comparable and terrible,\" Pöttering said.\n\nOn 16 June 2009, the EU General Affairs Council adopted conclusions stating that, \"in order to strengthen European awareness of crimes committed by totalitarian regimes, the memory of Europe's troubled past must be preserved, as reconciliation would be difficult without remembrance.\"\n\nOn 3 July 2009 the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe issued the Vilnius Declaration which, among other resolutions on several issues, contained a \"Resolution on Divided Europe Reunited: Promoting Human Rights and Civil Liberties in the OSCE Region in the 21st Century\" and supported the designation of 23 August as a European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism.\n\nJoseph Daul, chairman of the European People's Party group, stated:\n\n2009 is a deeply symbolic year, since we celebrate both the 60th anniversary of the creation of NATO and the beginnings of the cold war, and the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, which ended it. This is why we have proposed to launch a Europe-wide day of remembrance which will help Europe reconcile its totalitarian legacy, both from the Nazis and the Communists.\n\nIn 2009, the Seimas (Parliament) of Lithuania also endorsed the Prague Declaration, on the initiative of Emanuelis Zingeris.\n\nIn the European Parliament, an all-party group of MEPs named Reconciliation of European Histories Group was established. Its objective is to \"reconcile the different historical narratives in Europe and to consolidate them into a united European memory of the past.\" It is chaired by former EU Commissioner Sandra Kalniete. Its members also include Hans-Gert Pöttering, László Tőkés, Heidi Hautala, and Gunnar Hökmark.\n\nOn 25 February 2010, the Declaration on Crimes of Communism was adopted, concluding the international conference Crimes of the Communist Regimes, which was organised by the Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes and the Government of the Czech Republic in co-operation with the European Parliament, the European Commission, and the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, under the patronage of Jan Fischer, Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, and Heidi Hautala (Greens), Chair of the Human Rights Subcommittee of the European Parliament, among others. The 2010 declaration reiterated many of the suggestions of the Prague Declaration, stating that \"the justice done to perpetrators of Communist crimes over the past 20 years has been extremely unsatisfactory\" and calling for \"the creation of a new international court with a seat within the EU for the crimes of communism.\"\n\nThe European Union's Stockholm Programme states that:\n\nThe Union is an area of shared values, values which are incompatible with crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes, including crimes committed by totalitarian regimes. Each Member State has its own approach to this issue but, in the interests of reconciliation, the memory of those crimes must be a collective memory, shared and promoted, where possible, by us all.\n\nAs the European Union officially observed the European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism in 2010, the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact was described by the European Parliament's President Jerzy Buzek as \"the collusion of the two worst forms of totalitarianism in the history of humanity.\"\n\nIn December 2010, the foreign ministers of six EU member states called upon the European Commission to make \"the approval, denial or belittling of communist crimes\" an EU-wide criminal offence. \"Alongside the prosecution and punishment of criminals, the denial of every international crime should be treated according to the same standards, to prevent favourable conditions for the rehabilitation and rebirth of totalitarian ideologies,\" the foreign ministers wrote in a letter to justice commissioner Viviane Reding. Denial of all totalitarian crimes has been outlawed in only four member states: Poland, the Czech Republic, Lithuania and Hungary. Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg argued that the denial of the crimes of communism is analogous to denying the crimes of Nazism, which in many EU countries is a criminal offence, arguing that \"there is a fundamental concern here that totalitarian systems be measured by the same standard.\". However, a spokesman for justice commissioner Viviane Reding said that \"at this stage, the conditions to make a legislative proposal have not been met,\" citing an independent report the European Commission had commissioned to examine the existing legal framework of member states.\n\nIn a report from the European Commission on 12 January 2011, the European Commission stated that: \"The Commission is committed to contributing, in line with its responsibilities, to the promotion of the memory of the crimes committed by totalitarian regimes in Europe.\"\n\nOn 29 March 2011, a public hearing on \"What do Young Europeans know about Totalitarianisms?\" took place in the European Parliament, hosted by the European People's Party under the patronage of the Hungarian Presidency of the European Union, and organised by MEPs Sandra Kalniete, László Tőkés and Milan Zver. The purpose of the hearing was \"to focus on the importance to provide objective and comprehensive information about the totalitarian past, as public discourse can lead to a better, deeper understanding of our shared history and a greater feeling of unity.\" László Tőkés MEP, Vice-President of the European Parliament (EPP), said in his address during the hearing that: \"War crimes, genocide and mass murder—irrespective of what kind of totalitarian dictatorship committed them—will remain crimes against humanity, therefore we must stand up against them.\"\n\nIn May 2011, the Czech Senate almost unanimously demanded that the European Commission \"should in the future actively seek to create conditions for the punishment of crimes based on class and political hatred in the whole EU.\"\n\nOn 10 June 2011, the EU Justice and Home Affairs Council, that is, the justice and home affairs ministers of all EU Member States, adopted conclusions stating, \"inter alia\", that it reaffirmed \"the importance of raising awareness of the crimes committed by totalitarian regimes, of promoting a shared memory of these crimes across the Union and underlining the significant role that this can play in preventing the rehabilitation or rebirth of totalitarian ideologies,\" and highlighted \"the Europe-wide Day of Remembrance of the victims of the totalitarian regimes (23 August),\" inviting member states to \"consider how to commemorate it.\"\n\nOn 23 August 2011, the Polish Presidency of the European Union organised a conference on the occasion of the European Day of Remembrance for the Victims of Totalitarian Regimes. The EU presidency cited the Justice and Home Affairs Council conclusions of 10 June and the EU's Stockholm Programme, which emphasises that \"remembrance of shared history is necessary to understand contemporary Europe.\" European officials adopted the Warsaw Declaration for the European Day of Remembrance for the Victims of Totalitarian Regimes. The Warsaw Declaration vows that the suffering of victims of totalitarian regimes \"will not sink into oblivion.\" The declaration states that \"crimes of totalitarian regimes in Europe should be acknowledged and condemned, regardless of their type and ideology.\" Justice Minister Krzysztof Kwiatkowski said that the \"Warsaw Declaration is a unanimous agreement of all EU member states that we have to do everything we can to prevent any totalitarian regime from reviving in all the countries making up one big European family.\" Senate Speaker Bogdan Borusewicz said that \"the 20th century was the time of two totalitarianisms, ideologically different but functioning in a similar way.\" The EU called for launching and supporting educational and information initiatives on totalitarian regimes.\n\nOn 14 October 2011, the Platform of European Memory and Conscience, an EU educational project to raise awareness about totalitarian crimes and to combat intolerance, extremism, and anti-democratic movements, was established by the governments of the Visegrád Group and a number of European government institutions and NGOs, as an initiative of the Polish EU presidency and following decisions by the European Parliament and the EU Council supporting the project. Bringing together government institutions and organisations from EU countries active in research, documentation, awareness raising and education about the crimes of totalitarian regimes, the platform's member institutions include the Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes, the Institute of National Remembrance, the Berlin-Hohenschönhausen Memorial, the Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records, and other institutions. As an educational project of the EU, the Platform of European Memory and Conscience will facilitate co-operation among its member institutions and help combat intolerance, extremism, and anti-democratic movements.\n\nOn 19 October 2011, the European People's Party group hosted a public hearing in the European Parliament on the memory of the crimes committed by totalitarian regimes in Europe, chaired by Sandra Kalniete and with an introduction speech by Doris Pack, Chair of the Culture and Education Committee.\n\nIn February 2012, the sixth Mene Tekel international culture festival against totalitarianism, evil and violence took place in Prague, supported by the Platform of European Memory and Conscience. A 2012 declaration asking the former communist states to pass legislation enabling the just punishment of communist criminals and scrapping all advantages they may still enjoy was passed, and signed by 17 Czech NGOs as well as NGOs from Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia.\n\nOn 5 June 2012, the Platform of European Memory and Conscience, the European Network Remembrance and Solidarity, and the Reconciliation of European Histories Group hosted the conference Legal Settlement of Communist Crimes in the European Parliament, under the auspices of Hans-Gert Pöttering and Jerzy Buzek, devoted to the issue of forming a special court tribunal for the crimes of communism, and \"raising the issue of justice for the most serious crimes committed by the Communist dictatorships in Central and Eastern Europe from the national to a European level.\" The conference was a response \"to growing calls for strengthened international justice formulated e.g., in the Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism.\" Following the conference, the Platform of European Memory and Conscience founded an international legal expert group to \"work on a road map for establishing a supranational institution of justice\" devoted to the \"crimes committed by the Communist dictatorships.\"\n\nOn 23 August 2012, during a ceremony in the House of Terror museum and in the Hungarian Parliament commemorating the European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Totalitarianism in Budapest, opened by the Hungarian President János Áder, and attended by the Ministers or State Secretaries of Justice from several European countries, an agreement on the creation of a European museum of totalitarianism was signed.\n\nOn 14–15 May 2013, the EU Platform of European Memory and Conscience, the Polish state Institute of National Remembrance, the Warsaw Uprising Museum and the Czech state Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes hosted the conference \"Modern Forms of Commemoration of Totalitarian Genocide Places\" in Warsaw.\n\nSince it was signed in 2008, the Prague Declaration has been opposed by various groups. \"The Economist\" states: \"It has attracted support in bodies such as the European Parliament. But it has infuriated some, if not all, Jewish activists; left-wing politicians (mostly from western Europe); and inevitably, Russia.\"\n\nNotably, Russia protested against the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe's support for the European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism; its delegation tried but failed to have the resolution withdrawn. Several representatives of the Russia-based organisation World Without Nazism have criticised the Prague Declaration. The organisation's founder and chairman, Boris Spiegel, claimed that the Prague Declaration is supported by \"supporters of the Nazis,\" and accused the countries that were formerly part of the Communist Bloc (except Russia and Belarus) of \"rapid nazification.\" In response to the Prague Declaration's condemnation of Stalinism, he criticised the role of Western European democracies in starting WWII.\n\nEfraim Zuroff of the Simon Wiesenthal Center has criticised the Prague Declaration repeatedly, describing it as \"the main manifesto of the false equivalency movement.\"\n\nOn 20 January 2012, a declaration initiated by Dovid Katz, co-authored by Professor Danny Ben-Moshe of Deakin University, Melbourne, Australia, and signed by 70 parliamentarians, titled the Seventy Years Declaration, was issued, rejecting \"attempts to obfuscate the Holocaust by diminishing its uniqueness and deeming it to be equal, similar or equivalent to Communism as suggested by the 2008 Prague Declaration.\" The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Lithuania, Audronius Ažubalis, called the Seventy Years Declaration \"deplorable\" and \"pathetic,\" and said it echoed \"the Kremlin's ideologues\" and contradicted the position of the EU. He added that \"it is not possible to find differences between Hitler and Stalin except in their moustaches (Hitler's was shorter).\" The Prime Minister of Lithuania Andrius Kubilius argued that both Nazi and Soviet crimes are \"unique\" and the pain suffered is \"immeasurable\".\n\nThe Communist Party of Greece opposes the Prague Declaration and has criticised \"the new escalation of the anti-communist hysteria led by the EU council, the European Commission and the political staff of the bourgeois class in the European Parliament.\" The Communist Party of Britain opined that the Prague Declaration \"is a rehash of the persistent attempts by reactionary historians to equate Soviet Communism and Hitlerite Fascism, echoing the old slanders of British authors George Orwell and Robert Conquest.\"\n\nIn June 2008, Shimon Samuels of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre accused signatories Václav Havel and Vytautas Landsbergis of having \"anti-Semitic, racist and Holocaust distortionist motives.\" Lithuanian politician Leonidas Donskis MEP has accused the declaration of equating Soviet and Nazi crimes. On 29 October 2009, the British Labour MP John Mann called the declaration a \"sinister document, it uses the smokescreen of legitimate concerns about the evils of Communist regimes to insist that Soviet Communism and Nazi Fascism be declared equal.\"\n\nBarry Rubin argues that \"it is in the interest of Jews and Israelis to support the Prague Declaration which seeks to discuss, expose and recognize Communist crimes of war in the same way Nazi crimes were.\" Rubin criticises \"a tiny group of people\" of waging \"a relentless campaign\" against the declaration, and \"[making] Jews the defenders of the Communist totalitarian system that murdered and tortured millions of people, including hundreds of thousands of Jews.\" Efraim Zuroff responded: \"The opposition to the Prague Declaration has never been based on a desire to hide communist crimes, nor do we oppose any initiative to honor and commemorate their victims or punish those guilty of committing those crimes.\"\n\nŠarūnas Liekis, a Yiddish studies professor from Vilnius, criticised the actions of both sides of the debate, stating that \"we are squeezed between two Talibans\" and suggesting that \"the same obstinacy that plagues Lithuania's relations with Poland lies behind politicians' refusal to reverse their mistakes on Jewish issues.\"\n\nPost-communist studies scholar Vladimir Tismăneanu argues that the Prague Declaration and the Vilnius Declaration \"…can be seen as the fulfillment of the second stage of postcommunist development in the region […] both documents condemn the atrocities of the last century and resolve to proceed on a path of democracy and tolerance.\"\n\n"}

New London\", which expanded the power of states to use eminent domain to confiscate homes, businesses, and private property for \"economic development\", rather than just \"public use\".\n\nThis bill was sponsored by Senator John Cornyn, Republican from Texas.\n\n\nSome claim that, although this bill may have the right idea, it lacks the means to enforce itself. One organization, DownsizeDC.org, Inc., has proposed an amendment to this bill, one which it says would give this bill \"teeth\", as it calls it, or in other words, a means of enforcement.\n\n"}
{"id": "56215612", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56215612", "title": "Pseudolaw", "text": "Pseudolaw\n\nPseudolaw consists of statements, beliefs, or practices that are claimed to be based on accepted law or legal doctrine, but which deviate significantly from most conventional understandings of law and jurisprudence, or which originate from non-existent statutes or legal principals the advocate or adherent of incorrectly believes exist. It is sometimes referred to as \"legalistic gibberish\". The more extreme examples have been classified as paper terrorism.\n\nFollowers of such ideologies can cause problems for courts and government administrators by filing unusual applications that are difficult to process. Courts in Canada refer to such arguments as Organized Pseudolegal Commercial Arguments, and have called them frivolous and vexatious. There is no recorded instance of such tactics being upheld in a court of law.\n\nCommon among psudolegal beliefs is a belief that one is partially or fully sovereign from the country in which they live, and believe that no laws, or only certain laws, apply to them. Groups espousing such pseudolegal beliefs include freemen on the land and the sovereign citizen movement. Some believe that their state itself is illegitimate, such as Reichsbürgerbewegung.\n\nAlso under the umbrella of pseudolegal arguments are conspiracy theorists who believe there is a secret parallel legal system that one can access through certain means, like using a secret phrase or by placing stamps on the right place on documents. For example, the redemption movement believes that a secret fund is created for everyone at birth by the government, and that a procedure exists to \"redeem\" or reclaim money from this fund. See tax protester conspiracy arguments for a discussion of these beliefs related to tax law. Many of these revolve around the \"legal name fraud\" movement, which believes that birth certificates give the state legal ownership of a personal name and refusing to use this name therefore removes oneself from a court's jurisdiction. Various groups advocate that one can avoid this state ownership by distinguishing between capitalized and non-capitalized versions of one's name, or by adding punctuation to one's name. See strawman theory (also known as the capital letters argument) for more information.\n\n"}

The Chagos Islands, acquired by the United Kingdom in 1814, were reorganised as the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) in 1965 for the purpose of removing its inhabitants. Under a 1971 Order in Council, the Chagossians were forcibly removed, and the central island of Diego Garcia leased to the United States for use as a military outpost.\n\nIn 2000, Olivier Bancoult brought a judicial review claim against the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs for the initial ordinance which led to the Chagossian removal. Bancoult sought a writ of \"certiorari\" on the grounds that the ordinance was \"ultra vires\" (\"beyond power\" - that is, that the ordinance had been made without legal authority), a claim upheld by both the Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal. In response, Robin Cook, the Foreign Secretary, repealed the 1971 Order in Council and announced he would not appeal against the decision, allowing the Chagossians to return home.\n\nIn 2004, a second Order in Council, the British Indian Ocean Territory (Constitution) Order 2004, was produced, again reinstating the off-limits nature of the Chagos Islands. Bancoult brought a second case, arguing that this Order was again \"ultra vires\" and unreasonable, and that the British government had violated legitimate expectation by passing the second Order after giving the impression that the Chagossians were free to return home.\n\nThe new Order was again struck down by the Divisional Court and Court of Appeal before proceeding to the House of Lords where it was heard by Lords Hoffmann, Bingham, Rodger, Carswell and Mance between 30 June and 3 July 2008. In their judgment, issued on 22 October 2008, the Lords decided by a 3-2 majority to uphold the new Order in Council, stating that it was valid and, although judicial review actions could look at Orders in Council, the national security and foreign relations issues in the case barred them from doing so. In addition, Cook's statement had not been clear and unambiguous enough to provide legitimate expectation.\n\nThe reaction to the decision was negative, with academics accusing the majority Law Lords of failing to do their job as members of the judiciary to \"rework things like neo-imperial texts and outdated legal attitudes to the prerogative in order to cure obvious injustices and to vindicate a modern conception of the rule of law\"; at the same time, their approach to legitimate expectation was also questioned, with the case described as an \"unfortunate regression\" from \"Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service\", where judges were willing to debate legitimate expectation in a similarly politically sensitive situation.\n\nIn 2015 Bancoult went to court to argue that the judgement should be set aside due to the non-disclosure of a 2002 feasibility study relating to the resettlement of the former inhabitants of the Chagos Islands. The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom ruled against reviewing the case on 29 June 2016.\n\nThe Chagos Islands are a cluster of 60 islands and seven atolls in the Indian Ocean. First occupied by lepers from Mauritius, France acquired the islands in the late 18th century, and slaves were brought in from Africa and India to maintain coconut plantations placed there. Following Napoleon's defeat in 1814, the islands were ceded to the British in the Treaty of Paris, who administered them as a dependency of the Colony of Mauritius. Although the slaves were given their freedom in 1835, many remained on the Chagos Islands as contract workers, and their descendants and later immigrants are considered the indigenous people - the Chagossians.\n\nIn 1965, the British government reconstituted the islands as the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) through the British Indian Ocean Territory Order 1965, a statutory instrument under the Colonial Boundaries Act 1895. This instrument created the office of \"Commissioner of BIOT\", who given power to \"make laws for the peace, order and good government of the territory\". Accordingly, the Commissioner issued the Immigration Ordinance 1971, an Order in Council under the Royal Prerogative which required anyone entering or remaining in BIOT to seek permission beforehand.\n\nThis ordinance, with the reorganisation of the islands, was enacted to provide a method for removing the Chagos Islanders so that the islands could be used by the United States as a military base, particularly the island of Diego Garcia. From 1964 onwards the United States and United Kingdom had been in talks about leasing Diego Garcia to the US for military purposes, and by an exchange of notes dated 30 December 1966, the UK government transferred Diego Garcia to the US for the purpose of hosting a defensive communications base. This agreement was to last for 50 years, with an additional 20-year extension if neither party wished to withdraw.\n\nBetween 1967 and 1972 all 1,600 islanders were evacuated, and Diego Garcia continues to play a vital role in US military operations. Following a billion-dollar expansion program, the base has served as a \"bomber forward operating location\" for offensive operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. A US State Department letter dated 21 June 2000 described it as an \"all but indispensable platform\".\n\nIn 2000, Olivier Bancoult, a native Chagossian and leader of the Chagos Refugees Group, brought a judicial review claim against the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs for the initial ordinance which led to the Chagossian removal. Bancoult sought a writ of \"certiorari\" on the grounds that the ordinance was \"ultra vires\" and failed the \"Wednesbury\" test of reasonableness, as it was irrational.\n\nThe case, \"R (Bancoult) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs\", went to the Divisional Court, where it was heard by judges Richard Gibbs and John Laws. Bancoult's argument was made on several grounds: firstly, that the Crown could not exclude a British citizen from British territory, except in times of war, without a valid statutory basis or prerogative power. Secondly, the Chagossians had a constitutional right to inhabit their land under the Magna Carta, one which could not be abridged with delegated legislation, and third, the Commissioner of BIOT's duty to legislate \"for the peace, order and good government\" of BIOT's inhabitants could not be said to be fulfilled by relocating those inhabitants.\n\nThe respondent, the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO), argued that the English courts had no jurisdiction over the case, since the Crown is divisible amongst its territories, and the BIOT had its own courts. According to the FCO, Magna Carta, as a British constitutional document, was inapplicable to the Chagos Islands. They also maintained that \"make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Territory\" gave the Commissioner a wide enough jurisdiction to account for the order forcibly removing the Chagossians, and that the court could not decide in such a way as to force the government to break its treaty with the United States.\n\nThe Divisional Court gave its judgment on 3 November 2000, on three main issues: firstly, the court's right to hear the case, secondly, the Chagossians' constitutional right of residence and, thirdly, the status of the Commissioner's actions. The court found that it did have discretion to hear the case: while the Crown was divisible, the actions of the BIOT were clearly the actions of the British government, since every BIOT action was ordered and dealt with by the Foreign & Commonwealth Office. Laws J found that the Magna Carta did apply to foreign nations, as it was \"the nearest approach to an irreplaceable 'fundamental statute' that England has ever had... For in brief it means this, that the King is and shall be below the law\". This did not alone validate Bancoult's case, since it did not mean that the government's actions were illegal.\n\nThe final section of the judgment was on the legality of the Commissioner's 1971 ordinance. Laws J held that it was \"elementary\" that \"a legislature created by a measure passed by a body which is legally prior to it must act within the confines of the power thereby conferred\"; in this case that the Commissioner's jurisdiction was to legislate \"for the peace, order and good government\" of BIOT. While the latitude given to the Commissioner was wide, it \"may be a very large tapestry, but every tapestry has a border\". The court found that in the 1971 ordinance, the Commissioner had exceeded his authority, and the ordinance was made \"ultra vires\". Therefore, the ordinance was quashed.\n\nIn response to the Divisional Court's decision, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook stated on 3 November 2000 that he would accept the ruling, issuing the Immigration Ordinance 2000 which repealed the 1971 ordinance in its entirety. Due to \"security issues\", the British government was only prepared to let the Chagossians return to the outer islands, which were lacking in basic amenities. A \"feasibility study\" was conducted; a preliminary study was produced on 20 June 2000 and the full study was published on 10 July 2002. It concluded that:\n\nOn 1 June 2004, a second Order in Council was producedthe British Indian Ocean Territory (Constitution) Order 2004Section 9 of which provided that \"no person has the right of abode in the territory\" and \"no person is entitled to enter or be present in the territory except as authorised by or under this Order or any other law for the time being in force in the territory\". At the same time, the British Indian Ocean Territory (Immigration) Order 2004 came into effect, prohibiting entry to or presence in BIOT without a permit. In response, Bancoult brought a second case, claiming that Cook's statement had created a legitimate expectation (later frustrated by the 2004 orders) and questioning the validity of the Constitution Order 2004, particularly the legality of Section 9.\n\nThe case first went to the Divisional Court, where Hooper LJ and Cresswell J decided in favour of Bancoult on 11 May 2006. The court found that the \"interests of BIOT must be or must primarily be those whose right of abode and unrestricted right to enter and remain was being in effect removed\", and that as Section 9 of the Constitutional Order did not serve the interests of it or its inhabitants, it was irrational. At the same time, the court was asked to rule on whether an Order in Council could be questioned in judicial review proceedings. It decided that, under \"Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service\", the decisive element was not the origin of the power (in this case, the Royal Prerogative) but the nature of the power. Accordingly, Orders in Council were subject to judicial review. This decision was appealed to the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, composed of Butler-Sloss, Sedley and Neuberger LJJ, who agreed with the Divisional Court in their judgment issued on 23 May 2007.\n\nThe case was then taken to the House of Lords, where it was heard by Lords Hoffmann, Bingham, Rodger, Carswell and Mance. The pleadings occurred between 30 June and 3 July 2008, and judgment was issued on 22 October 2008. The judgment covered two matters: firstly, whether the courts could subject Orders in Council to judicial review and, secondly, the legality of the 2004 Order. The Lords unanimously agreed that, while Orders in Council are pieces of primary legislation, similar to Acts of Parliament (which cannot be subject to judicial review), there is a significant difference in that Orders in Council are an executive product and lack the \"representative character\" that comes with Parliamentary authority and approval. Accordingly, the Lords saw \"no reason why prerogative legislation should not be subject to review on ordinary principles of legality, rationality and procedural impropriety in the same way as any other executive action\".\n\nHowever, by a majority of 3 to 2, the Lords upheld the legality of the Constitutional Order, including Section 9. The majorityLords Hoffmann, Rodger and Carswellheld that BIOT was a \"conquered or ceded colony\" and therefore was subject to the prerogative powers of the Crown. They rejected the principle that there was a constitutional right to reside in one's own country, calling it \"extreme\", and concluded that in any case no such right could not trump legislation such as an Order in Council. The phrase \"peace, order and good government\", they thought, should be understood as referring not just to the inhabitants of BIOT but to the governance of the region. The wording was to be treated \"as apt to confer plenary lawmaking authority\" and reviewing the Order was a matter for the government and Parliament, not for the courts, since it was a political issue of national security and foreign relations. At the same time, no legitimate expectation had been created following \"Bancoult (No 1)\". The standard requirement for legitimate expectation, as decided in \"R v North and East Devon Health Authority, ex parte Coughlan\", was that there must be a \"clear and unambiguous\" promise made that led to a reliance or a detriment; Robin Cook's statement after the first Bancoult case could not be described as a clear and unambiguous promise of resettlement, and the requirements of reliance and detriment were not met.\n\nLords Bingham and Mance, dissenting, took the view that the Order in Council was unreasonable and therefore invalid. Bingham noted that the proper way to interpret an exercise of the royal prerogative was to look at how it had been exercised previously, and that he could not find any previous record of the prerogative being used to \"exile an indigenous population from its homeland\". He argued that this prerogative power did not exist: \"[t]he Crown has never had a prerogative power to prevent its subjects from entering the Kingdom, or to expel them from it\". Accordingly, the Order was \"ultra vires\". Bingham also maintained that it was irrational, since visits to the outer islands did not threaten US security, and unacceptable, in that no consideration had been given to the Chagossians. On the subject of legitimate expectation, the dissenters maintained that the statement should be \"construed according to the ordinary meaning that would be attached to it by those, principally the Chagossians and their supporters, to whom it was directed\"; Bingham saw the ordinary meaning as being that the Chagossians would be allowed to return home.\n\n\"Bancoult\" was the first case to directly state that, where there is a legitimate expectation, the information must have been relied upon, leading to a detriment. In prior cases it was simply an additional element, and not explicitly required. At the same time, \"Bancoult\" raised questions about the oversight of Orders in Council, given that it highlighted the courts are unwilling to review a piece of executive legislation where there are political elements in play. The decision also raised \"the classic problem of balancing human rights issues and concerns relating to security and defence\".\n\nThe public and academic reaction to the decision was negative. Thomas Poole considered that the Law Lords had failed in their duty as members of the judiciary: \"where old principles no longer fit contemporary constitutional and moral standards, why should we follow them? Surely the judicial task is to rework things like neo-imperial texts and outdated legal attitudes to the prerogative in order to cure obvious injustices and to vindicate a modern conception of the rule of law\". Margit Cohn agreed, writing on the legitimate expectation issue that \"It is difficult to accept that a public statement made by a Secretary of State, followed by the promulgation of an order that removed the previous prohibition to return, could not have created at least some sort of expectation\". Cohn further described the case as an \"unfortunate regression\" from the GCHQ case, where judges had been willing to debate legitimate expectation in a similarly politically sensitive situation. T.T. Arvind went further, drawing parallels with the judicial response to the Zong Massacre to argue that the decision, despite its formalist rhetoric, was in reality a pragmatic one which abandoned centuries of settled constitutional jurisprudence in relation to the limited scope of the Royal Prerogative.\n\n"}

Sir Matthew Hale added porpoise as one of the royal fish. Near the English coast they belong to the monarch immediately upon being caught, while ownership is also transferred to the monarch when a catch from any location is cast up on the shores. The kings of Denmark and the dukes of Normandy enjoyed a similar prerogative.\n\nThe monarch's right to royal fish was recognized by a statute enacted during the reign of Edward II. According to Henry de Bracton, \"de balena vero sufficit ... si rex habeat caput, et regina caudam\": \"the king owns the head of the whale, the queen owns the tail\". In \"Moby-Dick\", Herman Melville quoted the speculations of jurist William Prynne, that the queen received the tail, in order to be supplied with whalebone for her corsets and stays (although as Melville points out, \"whalebone\" is in fact baleen, from the \"mouths\" of certain whales). \n\nUnder current law, the Receiver of Wreck is the official appointed to take possession of royal fish when they arrive on English shores. The law of royal fish continues to excite some notice and occasional controversy, as evidenced when a fisherman caught and sold a sturgeon in Swansea Bay in 2004.\n\nKC Caviar, established in Yorkshire in 2012, has permission granted by the Queen allowing the company to farm the royal sturgeon fish.\n\nIn Scotland, the monarch's property right inheres in those whales too large to be pulled to land by a \"wain pulled by six oxen\"; in practice, this is interpreted as requiring the whales to be over 25 feet long. Authority to collect them on behalf of the monarch is given to the Scottish Government Marine Directorate.\n\nIn Ireland the English Crown, which held the Lordship of Ireland, also claimed the prerogative of taking royal fish, which extended to porpoises and dolphins. There is a record of a dispute between the Crown and Christopher St Lawrence, 2nd Baron Howth in about 1440 over the ownership of an exceptionally large grampus (Risso's Dolphin) which had been stranded on Howth peninsula in Dublin Bay. The Crown claimed it as a royal fish, while Lord Howth claimed it on foot of the immemorial right of his family to take possession of every grampus and porpoise found on the peninsula.\n\n"}
{"id": "28648059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28648059", "title": "Rule according to higher law", "text": "Rule according to higher law\n\nThe rule according to a higher law means that no law may be enforced by the government unless it conforms with certain universal principles (written or unwritten) of fairness, morality, and justice. Thus, \"the rule according to a higher law\" may serve as a practical legal criterion to qualify the instances of political or economical decision-making, when a government, even though acting in conformity with clearly defined and properly enacted legal rules, still produces results which many observers find unfair or unjust.\n\nThe idea of a law of ultimate justice over and above the momentary law of the state—a higher law—was first introduced into post-Roman Europe by the Catholic canon law jurists. \"Higher law\" can be interpreted in this context as the divine or natural law or basic legal values, established in the international law – the choice depending on the viewpoint. But this is definitely a Law above the law. And it is in this capacity that it possesses the equal legal value for both the common and civil law jurisdictions, as opposed to natural law which is largely associated with common law. \"To recognize the necessary connection between the rule of law as an ideal and well-constructed constitutional government does not and should not be taken to imply that all states can or should maintain the same constitutional structures in practice\".\n\n\"The rule according to higher law\" is a practical approach to the implementation of the higher law theory which creates a bridge of mutual understanding (with regard to universal legal values) between the English language doctrine of the rule of law, traditional for the countries of common law, and the originally German doctrine of \"Rechtsstaat\", translated into other languages of continental Europe as \"État de droit\" (Fr.), \"Estado de derecho\" (Sp.), \"Stato di diritto\" (It.), and \"Правовое государство\" (Ru.). The latter doctrine is the product of continental European legal thought which had adopted it from German legal philosophy. Its name can be translated into English as \"state of law\" —meaning the state in which the exercise of governmental power is kept in check by the higher law rather than by the changeable law established by this state. Amartya Sen mentioned that the legal theorists in ancient India used term of classical Sanskrit \"nyāya\" in the sense of not just a matter of judging institutions and rules, but of judging the societies themselves.\n\nBefore the U.S. Civil War, African Americans were legally denied equal rights and freedoms pursuant to formally valid codes prescribing the relations between master and slave. Although these codes were \"de jure\" fully suitable for application in legal practice, their enforcement by the then U.S. government \"de facto\" violated basic human rights of a significant part of the population. William H. Seward famously proclaimed that slavery is forbidden under \"a higher law than the Constitution.\"\n\nGenerally speaking, the occurrence of such \"justly enacted unjust laws\" fully depends on the stance taken by the country's political leadership towards the rule of law principle.\n\nIn some countries, the political leaders assert that the rule of law is purely a procedural concept. Therefore, they argue that any government may strip its subjects of their fundamental freedoms or infringe their vital interests so long as this is done by way of a duly implemented legal mechanism. For example, at the Nuremberg trials, in an attempt to justify their crimes against Jewish and Romany population of Europe during World War II, some of the former leaders of Nazi Germany argued that they had broken none of the laws effective when Hitler had been in power. It was only by invoking the rule according to a higher law that the Allied prosecutors were able to overcome such defenses.\n\nIn other countries, conversely, the political leaders assert that all written laws must be kept in line with the universal principles of morality, fairness, and justice. These leaders argue that, as a necessary corollary to the axiom that \"no one is above the law,\" the rule of law requires the government to treat all persons equally under the law. However, the proclaimed right to equal treatment is susceptible to instantly becoming void each time the government denies a sufficient level of respect, dignity, and autonomy to a certain class of individuals or to human rights in general.\"\nTherefore, the unwritten and universally self-explanatory principles of equality, autonomy, dignity, and respect are said to overrule conventional written laws enacted by the government. It is these principles that are often referred to as \"natural law.\" They also constitute the basis of the \"higher law theory\".\n\nThe \"Rechtsstaat\" doctrine (legal state, state of right, constitutional state, constitutional government) was first introduced by the German philosopher Immanuel Kant in his latest works completed after the U.S. and French constitutions had been adopted in the late 18th century. Kant’s approach is based on the supremacy of country’s written constitution created using principles of the Higher Law. This supremacy meant creating guarantees for the implementation of his central idea: a permanently peaceful life as a basic condition for the happiness and prosperity of the citizens. Kant was basing his doctrine exclusively on the idea of constitutionalism and constitutional government.\n\nThe Russian legal system, born in the 19th century as a result of the transformations initiated by the reforms of the Emperor Alexander II, was (and still is) based primarily upon the German legal tradition. It was from the latter that Russia had adopted the doctrine of \"Rechtsstaat\", which literally translates as \"Legal State.\" Its closest English analogue is \"the rule of law.\" The Russian Legal state concept adopts the written constitution as the country's supreme law (the rule of constitution). It is a fundamental but undefined principle that appears in the very first dispositive provision of Russia’s post-Communist constitution: \"The Russian Federation – Russia – constitutes a democratic federative legal state with a republican form of governance.\" Similarly, the very first dispositive provision of Ukraine’s Constitution declares that \"Ukraine is a sovereign and independent, democratic, social, legal state.\" Hence, the effort to invest meaning to the \"Legal State\" definition is anything but theoretical.\n\nValery Zorkin, President of the Constitutional Court of Russia, wrote in 2003, \"Becoming a legal state has long been our ultimate goal, and we have certainly made serious progress in this direction over the past several years. However, no one can say now that we have reached this destination. Such a legal state simply cannot exist without a lawful and just society. Here, as in no other sphere of our life, the state reflects the level of maturity reached by the society.\"\n\nThe Russian concept of Legal state has adopted many segments of constitutional economics which serves as a practical implementation of the higher law theory in economics.\n\nEconomist James M. Buchanan argues that, in the framework of constitutional government, any governmental intervention or regulation must be conditioned by the three following assumptions. First, every failure of the market economy to function smoothly and perfectly can be corrected by governmental intervention. Second, those holding political office and manning the bureaucracies are altruistic upholders of the public interest, unconcerned with their own personal economic well-being. And third, changing the government responsibilities towards more intervention and control will not profoundly and perversely affect the social and economic life.\n\nBuchanan rejects \"any organic conception of the state as superior in wisdom, to the individuals who are its members.\" This philosophical position is, in fact, the very subject matter of constitutional economics. A constitutional economics approach allows for a combined economic and constitutional analysis, helping to avoid a one-dimensional understanding. Buchanan, together with Kant, believes that a constitution in its capacity as the Higher Law, intended for use by at least several generations of citizens, must be able to adjust itself for pragmatic economic decisions, while balancing interests of the state and society against those of individuals, with their constitutional rights to personal freedom and private happiness.\n\nBuchanan also outlines importance of protection of the moral principles underlying constitutional norms. He writes that \"the ethics of constitutional citizenship is not directly comparable to ethical behavior in interaction with other persons within the constraints imposed by the rules of an existing regime. An individual may be fully responsible, in the standard ethical sense, and yet fail to meet the ethical requirement of constitutional citizenship.\"\n\n"}

Major rulings having included the 1999 ruling that Deputy Minister of Agriculture Newin Chidchop could retain his Cabinet seat after being sentenced to imprisonment for defamation, the 2001 acquittal of Thaksin Shinawatra for filing an incomplete statement with the National Counter-Corruption Committee, the 2003 invalidation of Jaruvan Maintaka appointment as Auditor-General, and the 2006 invalidation of the nationwide results of a House election.\n\nIn its very first decision, the Court ruled on the constitutionality of four emergency\nexecutive decrees issued by the Chuan government to deal with the Asian financial crisis. The government had issued the decrees in early May 1998 to expand the role of the Financial Restructuring Authority and the Assets Management Corporation, to settle the debts of the Financial Institutions Development Fund through the issue of 500 billion THB in bonds, and to authorize the Ministry of Finance to seek 200 billion THB in overseas loans. The opposition New Aspiration Party (NAP) did not have the votes to defeat the bills, and therefore, on the last day of debate, invoked Article 219 of the Constitution to question the constitutionality of an emergency decree.\n\nThe NAP argued that since there was no emergency nor necessary urgency (under Article 218(2)), the government could not issue any emergency decrees. Article 219, however, specifically notes the constitutionality of an emergency decree can be questioned only on Article 218(1) concerning the maintenance of national or public safety, national economic security, or to avert public calamity. The government, fearing further economic damage if the decree were delayed, opposed the Court's acceptance of the complaint, as the opposition clearly had failed to cite the proper constitutional\nclause. The Court wished to set a precedent, however, demonstrating it would accept petitions\nunder Article 219, even if technically inaccurate. Within a day it ruled that it was\nobvious to the general public that the nation was in an economic crisis, and that the decrees were\ndesigned to assist with national economic security in accordance with Article 218(1). The decrees were later quickly approved by Parliament.\n\nThe NAP's last minute motion damaged its credibility, and made it unlikely that Article 219 will\nbe invoked unless there is a credible issue and the issue is raised and discussed at the beginning\nof Parliamentary debate, rather than at the last-minute before a vote.\n\nOn the other hand, a precedent was established by the Court that it would accept all petitions under Article 219 to preserve Parliament's right to question the constitutionality of emergency executive decrees.\n\nAfter the sounding victory of Thaksin Shinawatra's party, Thai Rak Thai, in 2001 election, the Anti-Corruption Committee filed a case charging him as hiding a handful of assets in form of stocks, which is unlawful due to the 1997 Constitution. According to Thai law, senior government officials are required to declare their assets, along with those of their spouses and children under the age of 20, to the NCCC when they start and finish their terms in office. However Thaksin could escape the guilty as the judges ruled 8 to 7. Thaksin said it was his 'honest mistake'.\n\nThe NAP later filed impeachment proceedings with the National Counter Corruption Commission (NCCC) against Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and the Minister of Finance Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda for violation of the Constitution. The NAP argued that the letter of intent that the government signed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to secure emergency financial support was a treaty, and that Article 224 of the Constitution stipulated that the government must receive prior consent from Parliament to enter a treaty.\n\nThe NCCC determined the issue concerned a constitutional interpretation and petitioned the Constitutional Court for an opinion. The Court ruled the IMF letters were not treaties, as internationally defined, because they were unilateral documents from the Thai government with no rules for enforcement or provisions for penalty. Moreover, the IMF itself had worded the letters in a way that stated that the letters were not contractual agreements.\n\nOn 24 June 2003, a petition was filed with the Constitutional Court seeking its ruling on the constitutionality of Jaruvan Maintaka's appointment by the Senate as Auditor-General. Jaruvan was one of three nominees for the position of auditor-general in 2001, along with Prathan Dabpet and Nontaphon Nimsomboon. Prathan received 5 votes from the 8-person State Audit Commission (SAC) chairman while Jaruvan received 3 votes. According to the constitution, State Audit Commission chairman Panya Tantiyavarong should have submitted Prathan's nomination to the Senate, as he received the majority of votes. However, on July 3, 2001, the SAC Chairman submitted a list of all three candidates for the post of auditor-general to the Senate, which later voted to select Khunying Jaruvan Maintaka.\n\nThe Constitutional Court ruled on 6 July 2004 that the selection process that led to the appointment of Jaruvan as Auditor-General was unconstitutional. The Court noted that the Constitution empowers the SAC to nominate only one person with the highest number of votes from a simple majority, not three as had been the case. The court stopped short of saying if she had to leave her post. However, when the Constitutional Court had ruled on 4 July 2002 that the then Election Commission chairman Sirin Thoopklam's election to the body was unconstitutional, the President of the Court noted \"When the court rules that the selection [process] was unconstitutional and has to be redone, the court requires the incumbent to leave the post\".\n\nHowever, Jaruwan refused to resign without a royal dismissal from King Bhumibol Adulyadej. She noted \"\"I came to take the position as commanded by a royal decision, so I will leave the post only when directed by such a decision.\" The State Audit Commission later nominated Wisut Montriwat, former deputy permanent secretary of the Ministry of Finance, for the post of Auditor-General. The Senate approved the nomination on 10 May 2005. However, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, in an unprecedented move, withheld his royal assent. The National Assembly did not hold a vote to overthrow the royal veto. In October 2005 the Senate rejected a motion to reaffirm her appointment, and instead deferred the decision to the SAC.\n\nOn 15 February 2006 The State Audit Commission (SAC) decided to reinstate Auditor-General Khunying Jaruvan Maintaka. Its unanimous decision came after it received a memo from the Office of King Bhumibol Adulyadej's Principal Private Secretary, advising that the situation be resolved.\n\nThe controversy led many to reinterpret the political and judicial role of the King in Thailand's constitutional monarchy.\n\nIn February 2006, 28 Senators submitted a petition to the Constitutional Court calling for the Prime Minister's impeachment for conflicts of interest and improprieties in the sell-off of Shin Corporation under Articles 96, 216 and 209 of the Thai constitution. The Senators said the Prime Minister violated the Constitution and was no longer qualified for office under Article 209. However, the Court rejected the petition on 16 February, with the majority judges saying the petition failed to present sufficient grounds to support the prime minister's alleged misconduct.\n\n\n"}

However, systematic identity controls were still in place at the border between most member states.\n\nDisagreement between member states led to an impasse on the abolition of border controls within the Community, but in 1985 five of the then ten member states, Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany, signed an agreement on the gradual abolition of common border controls. The agreement was signed on the river-boat \"Princess Marie-Astrid\" on the river Moselle near the town of Schengen, Luxembourg, where the territories of France, Germany and Luxembourg meet. Three of the signatories Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands had already abolished common border controls as part of the Benelux Economic Union.\nThe Schengen Agreement was signed independently of the European Union, in part owing to the lack of consensus amongst EU member states over whether or not the EU had the jurisdiction to abolish border controls, and in part because those ready to implement the idea did not wish to wait for others (at this time there was no enhanced co-operation mechanism). The Agreement provided for harmonisation of visa policies, allowing residents in border areas freedom to cross borders away from fixed checkpoints and the replacement of passport checks with visual surveillance of vehicles at reduced speed and vehicle checks that allowed vehicles to cross borders without stopping.\n\nIn 1990, the Agreement was supplemented by the Schengen Convention which proposed the abolition of internal border controls and a common visa policy. It was this Convention that created the Schengen Area through the complete abolition of border controls between Schengen member states, common rules on visas, and police and judicial cooperation.\n\nThe Schengen Agreement along with its implementing Convention was implemented in 1995 only for some signatories, but just over two years later during the Amsterdam Intergovernmental Conference, all European Union member states except the United Kingdom and Ireland had signed the Schengen Agreement. It was during those negotiations, which led to the Amsterdam Treaty, that the incorporation of the \"Schengen acquis\" into the main body of European Union law was agreed along with opt-outs for Ireland and the United Kingdom, which were to remain outside of the Schengen Area.\nIn December 1996 two non-EU member states Norway and Iceland signed an association agreement with the signatories of the Schengen Agreement to become part of the Schengen Area. While this agreement never came into force, both countries did become part of the Schengen Area after concluding similar agreements with the EU. The Schengen Convention itself was not open for signature by non-EU member states. In 2009, Switzerland finalised its official entry to the Schengen Area with the acceptance of an association agreement by popular referendum in 2005.\n\nNow that the Schengen Agreement is part of the \"acquis communautaire\", the Agreement has, for EU members, lost the status of a treaty, which could only be amended according to its terms. Instead, amendments are made according to the legislative procedure of the EU under EU treaties. Ratification by the former agreement signatory states is not required for altering or repealing some or all of the former Schengen acquis. Legal acts setting out the conditions for entry into the Schengen Area are now made by majority vote in the legislative bodies of the European Union. New EU member states do not sign the Schengen Agreement as such, instead being bound to implement the Schengen rules as part of the pre-existing body of EU law, which every new entrant is required to accept.\n\nThis led to the result that non-EU Schengen member states have few formally binding options to influence the shaping and evolution of Schengen rules; their options are effectively reduced to agreeing, or withdrawing from the agreement. However, consultations with affected countries are conducted prior to the adoption of particular new legislation.\n\n"}

The new constitution was approved by about 66% of those who voted; turnout was 77%. Registered voters at the time were mostly white because of the qualified franchise, under which only those who met certain financial, educational and property standards were eligible to vote.\n\nFollowing three years of negotiations with the Southern Rhodesian government and other parties, the British government had put forward a draft constitution on 13 June 1961. It provided for a parliamentary system, with a 65-seat parliament; the previously common voters' roll was divided into two rolls, the \"A\" roll and the \"B\" roll, the latter of which had lower qualifications intended to make it easier for prospective voters to enter the political system. There were 50 \"A\"-roll constituencies and 15 larger \"B\"-roll districts, with a complicated mechanism of \"cross-voting\" allowing \"B\"-roll voters to slightly influence \"A\"-roll elections and \"vice versa\". This system was theoretically non-racial, but in practice the \"A\" roll was largely white and the \"B\" roll was almost all black.\n\nIn protest against the official referendum, the black nationalist National Democratic Party (NDP) ran its own poll, professedly based on \"one man, one vote\", on 23 July. This was peacefully operated, but reportedly amateur and potentially biased in its execution, garnering criticism from British officials, rival nationalists and other observers amidst its virtually unanimous rejection of the constitution. The British High Commission commented that voters in the NDP referendum appeared to be subject to intimidation by the NDP officials running the exercise, and that the votes did not seem to be secret. The rival Zimbabwe National Party called the NDP poll \"phoney\" and said it was designed \"to hoodwink the African people\". There were many cases of people posting multiple ballots: two whites told the press they had voted twice and one black man proudly announced that he had done so 11 times. After the government released the results of the official referendum, the NDP announced that their poll had garnered 467,189 votes against the constitution, and only 584 in favour—a reported majority of about 99.9% against. According to historian J. R. T. Wood, the NDP referendum \"smacked of farce\"; he highlights the fact that the general strike of black workers called by the NDP for the next day was adhered to by less than 10% of the black workforce.\n"}

They were designed to allow tribal and state governments to come to a \"business\" agreement. A compact can be thought of as \"negotiated agreement between two political entities that resolves questions of overlapping jurisdictional responsibilities Compacts affect the delicate power balance between states, federal, and tribal governments. It is these forms that have been a major source of controversy surrounding Indian gaming. Thus, it is understandable that the IGRA provides very detailed instructions for how states and tribes can make compacts cooperatively and also details the instructions for how the federal government can regulate such agreements.\n\nSection 3A of the Act includes specific instructions for the process of developing a tribal-state compact. Tribes(Native Americans) are expected to request a compact with states if they should desire to have Class III gaming. (States have no jurisdiction over Class I and II gambling.) Following such a request, states are required to enter negotiations and deal with the tribes in \"good faith\". The original text of the act implied that if states tried to \"stone-wall\" tribal gambling, the tribes could look to the federal courts for support. But while the IGRA gives states unprecedented influence on tribal economic concerns, it also seeks to maintain the federal government as the \"guardian\" of the tribes. Accordingly, section 3B maintains the power of the federal government in this aspect. No compact will be valid until the United States Secretary of the Interior has entered the compact into the Federal registry. Also, tribes who feel that a state is not negotiating in \"good faith\" have the right to sue the states in federal court.\nThe topics that compacts may cover include provisions relating to criminal/civil laws of the tribe or state in relation to the gambling activity, the allocation of court jurisdiction between the State and Indian tribe necessary to enforce these laws, money the State should receive to defray the costs of regulating the gambling, and any other such subjects directly related to the operation of gaming activities. It also specifies that Indian tribe shall have the right to regulate gaming concurrently with the state, unless some aspect of the compact is broken.\n\nThe IGRA takes specific notice of the fact that the text is not \"conferring upon a State or any of its political subdivisions the authority to impose any taxes, fee, charge, or other assessment upon an Indian tribe. This reference indicates that the Congress realized it was not following the norm of tribal governments operating independently of states.\n\nThe compacts between states and tribes have caused a great deal of controversy and the original definition of Tribal-State Compacts has been redefined by several court cases and congressional acts. This section will address the more prominent actions that have refined the methods of establishing Tribal-State compacts.\n\nIndian gambling has been the source and focus of a great deal of controversy. Part of the reason for this is the ambiguity that surrounds tribal sovereignty in the legal sense.\n\nMuch of the current understanding of tribal sovereignty can be traced back to John Marshall and his decisions. American government has long operated under the legacy of \"Worcester v. Georgia\", which stated strongly that the history of relations with Indians had established the understanding that tribes were \"distinct political communities, having territorial boundaries, within which their authority is exclusive\". However, tribes were still subject to federal regulation and laws. As Marshall had already confirmed in \"Cherokee Nation v. Georgia\" where he labeled tribes as having a ward relationship to the \"guardian\" national government.\nThese decisions occurred quite some time ago, but have shaped much of the modern dealings with tribal sovereignty. There have been some exceptions made to allowing states some impact on tribes (such as Public Law 280 and crimes committed by a non-Indian to a non-Indian on tribal land), but for the most part have restricted states from interfering. When states are allowed to regulate tribal activity, there are strict guidelines to be met. On the part of federal action, the assumption is that tribes have the inherent right to govern themselves unless federal action specifically prevents an action.\n\nThe first major case to address Indian gambling and state regulation was \"California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians\" in 1987. In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that California did not have the right to regulate gaming unless there were criminal prohibitions against gaming in the state. Furthermore, the case set the precedent of only allowing state regulation of the tribes rarely and with federal preemption only. In denying the states the right to regulate tribal gambling, the court had essentially forced the task on to Congress. Thus, the emergence of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act came on October 17, 1988. The act itself was an attempt to provide regulation while maintaining tribal sovereignty. The only \"sticky\" problem had to do with casino-style gambling. Because casino-style gambling is a \"cash business\" (relative to bingo) there were many who were concerned that it would attract crime (organized and otherwise). In fact, this was perhaps one of the main concerns on part of the states who were lobbying the federal government for some right to regulate gaming because of the chance of such infiltration. The tribal-state compacts came about as a compromise in concern for the casino-style gambling (Class III). The tribal-state compacts were seen as a necessary and fair political compromise by Congress, but in reality by incorporating these compacts, the IGRA seems to be illustrating a contemporary move towards devolution in some experts' opinions. Compacts do require that tribes cede some jurisdictional powers to state governments. Some may view the IGRA as a means of respecting tribal sovereignty, but in placing the necessity of compacts, the IGRA is actually establishing limitations on the authority of the tribes.\n\nUnder the original legislation of the IGRA, Congress did try to maintain the tribal sovereignty. The act created a mechanism to limit state's ability to take advantage of the tribes by allowing tribes to sue states who did not operate in \"good faith\". If the federal court found that states did not negotiate in good faith, it could then require that a compact be agreed upon within 60 days. If after this time had passed, the interior secretary would be assigned the task of drafting a compact- which may would most likely be a disadvantage to the states. This ability together with the requirement that the Secretary of the Interior approve all gaming compacts worked to ensure federal oversight of any state regulation- which should have softened the blow of tribal state compacts on sovereignty. In 1991, however, \"Seminole Tribe v. Florida\" upset the tribal-state balance that Congress had intended under the IGRA. This case ultimately denied tribes the right to sue states based on the Eleventh Amendment (which grants states sovereign immunity). Furthermore, the case ruled that Congress had overstepped its authority in drafting the IGRA. \"Seminole Tribe\", then, acted to remove Congress's limited protection for tribes and removed any mechanisms for enforcing the \"good-faith\" clause. Experts have noted that in drafting the IGRA, Congress sought to protect the tribes, but in passing the decision in this case, the Court ignored this intention and allowed the balance of power shift in favor of the states.\n\nThe \"Seminole\" case greatly expanded the state power over tribal gaming. In denying tribes the right to bring suit against states, the Court did not halt the compact process, but it did destroy the only remedial scheme devised by\nCongress for compelling states to negotiate in good faith with their tribal counterparts. Congress had already recognized that without any way to enforce the \"good faith\" of states, states could simply refuse to negotiate compacts and the tribes would essentially lose its right to conduct gaming. The Court, however, did not seem concerned with this particular consequence to its decision. After the case, some states refused to negotiate, but even more demanded concessions from the tribes (sharing gaming profits among other demands). In some states, tribes had to give up treaty rights to gain receive a chance to get a compact. In Wisconsin, for instance, Governor Tommy Thompson sought to include tribes' rights to hunting and fishing treaty rights as issues for negotiations. Some states have an attempted to bring about revenue sharing, though there are strict regulations under the IGRA for this. The Court had attempted to uphold these restrictions, such as in \"In re Indian Gaming Related Cases\" the court held that a state could not violate IGRA’s prohibition against the imposition of taxes and should negotiate rather than impose. However, once again in lieu of Seminole, tribes have no means by which to negotiate. Tribal gambling under the law is a dynamic issue that is still contested and there are many proposals for ways to fix the \"gap\" that the \"Seminole\" case left in the IGRA.\n\n"}

{"id": "31504168", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31504168", "title": "Women's Brigade (Broken Hill)", "text": "Women's Brigade (Broken Hill)\n\nThe Women's Brigade was a labour protest organisation for women formed during the first of several strikes to occur in the mining town of Broken Hill, NSW, Australia between 1889-1920.\n\nAs early as 1874, Australian women were engaging in direct action in mining disputes in Australia. During the 1874 strikes at the Wallaroo and Moonta mines in South Australia, women entered the mines armed with brooms, forced the men out and closed down the engines.\n\nThe notice for the first meeting read:\nA number of Broken Hill Women are very anxious to do something towards supporting the men now out on strike and a meeting for women only will be held at the Masonic Hotel tonight, at 7:30. The president will be the chair. Mr T.C. Tait, the proprietor of the Masonic Hotel, has kindly given the use of his new hall, erected at the site of the hotel, for the use of the women's brigade. All matrons and maids who are in sympathy with the union are requested to attend.\n\nAccording to Unbroken Spirit, 'Poor living conditions and negligent managerial policy on the mines at Broken Hill fed into a strong union presence from the very early days'. Women and children found life in the mining town harsh, yet fought alongside the miners in favour of the union goals despite the hardship prolonged strikes caused to family welfare.\n\nAccording to Carroll (1986), and Blainey (1968) there was particular concern in the town regarding lead poisoning from the mine dust. Due to a long delay in developing the technical process for extracting value from the low-lying ores that were mined at Broken Hill, 40 ft high hills of toxic tailings were created about the mines and left without processing until the opening of the Newcastle BHP Steelworks in 1915.\n\nBroken Hill's first mining strike occurred in 1889 as a result of the trade union ultimatum that members not be made to work with non-unionised workers. The strike lasted a week and during this time the Women's Brigade was formed.\n\nBy the time of the arrival of BHP directors from Melbourne on 13 November, the Women's Brigade had set up as 'sentinels' in order to catch any non-union labour, including shift bosses who were 'tarred and whitewashed' the following day while the 2500 miners met to negotiate the dispute with the directors.\n\nA small number of men were injured by the Women's Brigade on 14 November. As a result of this Richard Sleath on behalf of the union distanced himself from their actions while mentioning the resolve of the women who had a week's worth of provisions and that they intended to remain on picket for the week. An appeal was made for the miners to use their influence with the women to calm their behaviour.\n\nThe brigade now numbers 400 members, many of whom took part in the famous sweeping affair at the Moonta and Wallaroo mines 15 years ago. Two hundred women spent the night in the mines and two of them have been locked up for trespassing.\n\nThe Women's Brigade was very active in using direct action methods against the imported contract labour during the 1892 Broken Hill miners' strike. According to Bloodworth (1996), there were daily mass rallies and the Barrier United Females' Strike Protest Committee was formed in the initial weeks. The 500-strong Brigade passed a resolution to join the 24 August union demonstration but this was later abandoned in favour of a women's rally on the 25th.\n\nProminent suffragette, Mary Lee publicly supported the women of Broken Hill claiming 'that the women of Broken Hill are the first great body of working women who have raised their voices in united protest against the glaring injustice that \"the present constitution will not allow them a voice in framing the laws\"...' and that this rendered the 1892 Broken Hill miners' strike 'more profoundly interesting' than any before.\n\nThe womenfolk that evening at least got some of their own back, for wherever a 'cop' was observed during the march, he either received a 'back-hander' from a woman on passing or was spat upon. This happened not once, but hundreds of times during that memorable tramp through the city's streets. And, under the circumstances, show to me the workingman that did not, and does not, applaud such acts, and I will show you a creature who lives but to creep and to cringe, and knows but little of the history of his class, or the damnable actions of its historic enemies.\n"}
