Peterson, 578 U.S. ___ (2016), was a United States Supreme Court case that found that a law which only applied to a specific case, identified by docket number, and eliminated all of the defenses one party had raised does not violate the separation of powers in the United States Constitution between the legislative (Congress) and judicial branches of government. The plaintiffs in the trial court, respondents in the Supreme Court, were several parties who had obtained judgments against Iran for its role in supporting state-sponsored terrorism, particularly the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings and 1996 Khobar Towers bombing, and sought execution against a bank account in New York held, through European intermediaries, on behalf of Bank Markazi, the state-owned Central Bank of Iran. The initial plaintiffs obtained court orders preventing the transfer of funds from the account in 2008 and initiated their lawsuit in 2010. Bank Markazi raised several defenses against the execution against the account, including that the account was not an asset \"of\" the bank, but rather an asset of its European intermediary, under both New York state property law and §201(a) of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. In response to concerns that existing laws were insufficient for the account to be used to settle the judgments, Congress included a section within a 2012 bill, codified after enactment as 22 U.S.C. § 8772, that identified the pending lawsuit by docket number, applied only to the assets in the identified case, and essentially abrogated every legal basis available to Bank Markazi to prevent the plaintiffs from executing their claims against the account. Bank Markazi then argued that § 8772 was an unconstitutional breach of the separation of power between the legislative and judicial branches of government, because it effectively directed a particular result in a single case without changing the generally applicable law. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and, on appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit both upheld the constitutionality of § 8772 and cleared the way for the plaintiffs to execute their judgments against the account, which held about $1.75 billion in cash.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court granted certiorari and heard oral arguments in the case in January 2016, releasing their opinion in April 2016. A 6–2 majority found that § 8772 was not unconstitutional, because it \"changed the law by establishing new substantive standards\"—essentially, that if Iran owns the assets, they would be available for execution against judgments against Iran—for the district court to apply to the case. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, writing for the majority, explained that the federal judiciary has long upheld laws that affect one or a very small number of subjects as a valid exercise of Congress' legislative power and that the Supreme Court had previously upheld a statute that applied to cases identified by docket number in \"Robertson v. Seattle Audubon Society\" (1992). The majority also upheld § 8772 as a valid exercise of Congress' authority over foreign affairs. Prior to the enactment of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) in 1976, Congress and the Executive branch had authority to determine the immunity of foreign states from lawsuits. Despite transferring the authority to determine immunity to the courts through the FSIA, the majority contended that \"it remains Congress' prerogative to alter a foreign state's immunity.\"\n\nChief Justice John Roberts, joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, dissented and harshly criticized the majority's holding. After providing historical context for the separation of powers between the legislature and judiciary found in Article III of the United States Constitution, the Chief Justice explained that § 8772 is a type of unconstitutional breach of the separation of powers between Congress and the judiciary \"whereby Congress assumes the role of judge and decides a particular case in the first instance.\" In his view, § 8772 is no different than a hypothetical law applying to a case \"Smith v. Jones\" in which the legislature says simply \"Smith wins\". In the Chief Justice's view, § 8772 was not a valid exercise of Congress' foreign affairs authority; he contended that Congress and the Executive branch have sufficient authority that they do not need to \"seize\" the judiciary's power to \"make a political decision look like a judicial one.\" Quoting James Madison in \"Federalist No. 48\", the Chief Justice lamented that this case \"will indeed become a blueprint for extensive expansion of the legislative power at the judiciary's expense, feeding Congress's tendency to 'extend[] the sphere of its activity and draw[] all power into its impetuous vortex.'\"\n\nThe decision came as Iran was seeking access to the world financial market just three months after many sanctions were lifted as a result of Iran's compliance with an agreement for curtailing development of its nuclear enrichment program. Various Iranian officials denounced the decision as \"theft\", \"a ridicule of law and justice\", and \"open hostility by the United States against the Iranian people.\" Iran announced that they would file suit against the United States in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for reparations if the U.S. courts begin to \"plunder\" assets from the Citibank account to give to the winning plaintiffs, although it is not clear if the ICJ would have jurisdiction to entertain the case.\n\nForeign states generally enjoy immunity from lawsuits in the United States under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA). The FSIA is the exclusive basis for U.S. courts to exercise jurisdiction over a foreign government. Prior to enactment of the FSIA in 1976, the executive branch was responsible for determining the immunity of foreign states on a case-by-case basis. By enacting the FSIA, Congress codified the guidelines for the immunity of foreign states and transferred responsibility for determining a foreign state's immunity from the executive branch to the judiciary.\n\nThe FSIA contains an exception to the immunity of foreign states for victims of state-sponsored terrorism. Prior to 2002, if a judgment was awarded against a foreign government, only assets of the foreign government that were located in the U.S. and \"used for commercial activity\" could have been seized to satisfy the judgment. To make judgments easier to enforce, Congress enacted the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA) which allows judgments to be executed against \"the blocked assets of [a] terrorist party.\" Blocked assets include assets that may be seized by the President pursuant to his authority granted by Congress.\n\nThe suit involved more than 1300 individuals who had won several separate judgments against Iran for its supportive role in the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings, the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing, several other bombings, an assassination, and a kidnapping. After winning judgments by default, based on a clear evidentiary basis for Iran's liability, they sought writs of execution against a Citibank account in New York connected with Iran's central bank. The suits for execution against the Citibank account were consolidated into one case through various procedural mechanisms.\n\nThe named plaintiff in the case, Deborah Peterson, is the sister of a victim of the Beirut barracks bombings; joined by victims and other relatives of victims, she had won a default judgment in 2003 against Iran for its role in the bombings. Because of the large number of plaintiffs in the case—almost 1,000—the judge appointed special masters to determine each plaintiff's right to collect damages and appropriate amount of damages; in 2007, the judge entered a default judgment against Iran for $2,656,944,877 in damages.\nIn 2008, the plaintiffs first learned of the interests of the Central Bank of Iran (Bank Markazi) in a Citibank bank account in New York and obtained orders restraining the transfer of funds from the account. The account consisted of bonds and belonged to a Luxembourg-based bank, Clearstream Banking, S.A., which held the account on behalf of Bank Markazi and deposited interest from the bonds into Bank Markazi's Clearstream account. At some point in 2008, an account for Bank Markazi was opened with Italian bank Banca UBAE to place the interest payments from the Clearstream account, placing a second intermediary between Bank Markazi and the Citibank account. By the time of the Supreme Court hearing, the Citibank account held about $1.75 billion in cash, as the last of the bonds had matured in April 2012. In 2010, the plaintiffs initiated their lawsuit against Bank Markazi, Clearstream, Banca UBAE, and Citibank, jointly, seeking to execute against the Citibank account their judgments for damages against Iran, based on §201(a) of the TRIA, which provides that when \"a person has obtained a judgment against a terrorist party ... the blocked assets of that terrorist party (including the blocked assets of any agency or instrumentality of that terrorist party) shall be subject to execution or attachment.\"\n\nIn February 2012, President Obama froze all assets of the Iranian government in the U.S., which included the Citibank account alleged to be controlled by Bank Markazi. However, there were concerns that existing laws were insufficient for the account to be used to settle the judgments. Bank Markazi claimed that the account was not an asset \"of\" Bank Markazi, but its intermediary, Clearstream, in relation to both TRIA and New York state property law.\n\nDue to the issues raised in the case, Congress included a section within the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act, codified as 22 U.S.C. § 8772, that preempted any state law and provided that:\nIn response to concerns the banking industry had to early drafts of the legislation, § 8772 specified the assets that the section pertains to as:\nSection 8772 also specified that the courts needed to identify \"whether Iran holds equitable title to, or the beneficial interest in, the assets ...and that no other person possesses a constitutionally protected interest in the assets ...under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\" If another person held a constitutionally protected interest in the assets, their interest in the assets would not be infringed by the law.\n\nSection 8772 eliminated all of Bank Markazi's defenses to the seizure of the account's assets, valued at approximately $1.75 billion. Bank Markazi conceded that they held \"equitable title to, or beneficial interest in, the assets\", per §8772(a)(2)(A), but then claimed that § 8772 violated the separation of powers in the United States Constitution between the legislative (Congress) and judicial branches of government. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and, on appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit both upheld the constitutionality of § 8772 and awarded the assets to the plaintiffs.\n\nOn December 29, 2014, Bank Markazi filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court of the United States, requesting the Court to consider the question: Does § 8772 violate the separation of powers by purporting to change the law for, and directing a particular result in, a single pending case? The certiorari petition was circulated to the Justices for their conference on April 3, 2015, after a brief by the respondents (Peterson) opposing certiorari and a reply brief from the petitioner (Bank Markazi) were filed in March. Following the April 3rd conference, the Court called for the Solicitor General to file a brief expressing the views of the federal government, which was filed on August 19. In May and June, the Supreme Court meets only to issue orders and opinions and does not hear oral arguments until the next term begins. The Court granted certiorari following its conference on September 28.\n\nOral arguments were held on January 13, 2016 with appearances by Jeffrey Lamken for the petitioner, Theodore Olson for the respondents, and Deputy Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler for the United States as \"amicus curiae\". \nJustice Antonin Scalia was present during oral arguments. He passed away in February, voiding his vote in the initial vote on the case's outcome and precluding any draft opinion he may have written from being published by the Court. The Court's 6-2 opinion was delivered on April 20, 2016.\n\nOn January 13, 2016, during oral argument with Theodore Olson, Chief Justice John Roberts said:\nHis dissenting opinion is discussed in detail below.\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote the majority opinion, which held that § 8772 does not infringe on the separation of powers between the legislative and judicial branches of government, considering also that the law is an exercise of congressional authority regarding foreign affairs. Justice Anthony Kennedy, Justice Clarence Thomas, Justice Stephen Breyer, Justice Samuel Alito, and Justice Elena Kagan joined the majority opinion (however, Justice Thomas did not join as to Part II-C of the opinion).\n\nThe majority began by explaining that judiciary's authority under Article III of the United States Constitution is to \"'say what the law is'\", quoting \"Marbury v. Madison\" (1803). \"Congress, no doubt, may not usurp a court's power to interpret and apply the law to the circumstances before it\" by, for example, saying in a hypothetical case \"Smith v. Jones\" that Smith wins or compelling the courts to reexamine a case after final judgment has been issued.\n\nBank Markazi relied on \"United States v. Klein\" (1871) for much of its argument. In \"Klein\", the Court questioned whether \"'the legislature may prescribe rules of decision to the Judicial Department ... in cases pending before it.'\" The majority found that \"[o]ne cannot take this language from \"Klein\" at face value\" because the power of Congress to make retroactive laws applicable to pending cases has long been recognized. The majority explained that the contemporary significance of \"Klein\" is that \"Congress may not exercise its authority, including its power to regulate federal jurisdiction, in a way that requires [federal courts]...to become active participants in violating the Constitution.\" The unfairness of any retroactive legislation is \"'not a sufficient reason for a court to fail to give that law its intended scope.'\" The Constitution contains only limited constraints on the enactment of retroactive legislation:\n\nThe majority affirmed that \"Congress may indeed direct courts to apply newly enacted, outcome-altering legislation in pending civil cases,\" citing its previous decisions in \"Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc.\" (1995), \"Robertson v. Seattle Audubon Society\" (1992), and \"Landgraf v. USI Film Products\" (1994). Accordingly, the majority found that § 8772 \"changed the law by establishing new substantive standards\"—essentially, that if Iran owns the assets, they would be available for execution against judgments against Iran—for the district court to apply to the case. Section 8772 left several issues for the District Court to adjudicate: it did not define its key terms \"beneficial interest\" and \"equitable title\"; whether any other party had a constitutionally protected interest in the account; and whether the assets were \"held in the United States\" (Clearstream argued the assets were located in Luxembourg, not New York).\n\nThe fact that the law only applied to one case does not change its validity, although the majority conceded that a narrowly crafted law affecting just one person or a limited number of people may violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \"if arbitrary or inadequately justified.\" The federal judiciary has long upheld laws that affect one or a very small number of subjects as a valid exercise of Congress' legislative power, and the Supreme Court upheld a statute that applied to cases identified by docket number in \"Robertson v. Seattle Audubon Society\" (1992).\n\nThe final portion of the majority's opinion, in which Justice Thomas did not join, upheld § 8772 as a valid exercise of Congress' authority to regulate foreign affairs. Citing \"Dames & Moore v. Regan\" (1981), a case which also involved the availability of Iranian assets for execution of judgments against Iran, the majority points out that regulating foreign-state assets—e.g. by blocking them or regulating their availability for execution against judgments—has never been found to violate the judiciary's authority. Prior to the enactment of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA), the Executive branch routinely made case-specific determinations of the scope of immunity for foreign states. Those decisions were not rejected as infringements on the judiciary's authority. Although the enactment of the FSIA in 1976 transferred authority to the courts to determine foreign-state immunity, the majority held that \"it remains Congress' prerogative to alter a foreign state's immunity.\" When Congress enacted § 8772, it \"acted comfortably within the political branches' authority over foreign sovereign immunity and foreign-state assets.\"\n\nChief Justice John Roberts, joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, dissented from the majority's ruling. It was the first time that Roberts and Sotomayor were the only two dissenters in a case; they had been on the court together since 2009.\n\nRoberts began his argument with an analogy:\n\nIn the Chief Justice's view, § 8772 violates the separation of powers in Article III \"[n]o less than if [Congress] had passed a law saying 'respondents win.'\" The majority responded that a more appropriate analogy to the case is if a legislature enacts a law specifying that a 2000 map supersedes a 1990 map in an ongoing property dispute in which the parties are contesting whether an ambiguous statute makes a 1990 or 2000 county map the authoritative source for establishing property boundaries.\n\nThe Chief Justice proceeded to detail the origin, purpose, and case law history of the separation of powers. Article Three of the United States Constitution establishes an independent judiciary with \"distinct and inviolable authority.\" Such separation of powers \"safeguards individual freedom.\" As Alexander Hamilton wrote in \"Federalist No. 78\", quoting Montesquieu, \"'there is no liberty if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers.'\" The separation of powers between the judiciary and legislative branches was examined in detail in \"Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc.\" (1995), in which the Supreme Court found unconstitutional a statute that reopened a case after a final judgment. At the time of the framing of the Constitution, judicial and legislative powers were often intermingled. The colonial legislatures often performed many of the functions of the judiciary, such as functioning as the court of last resort, granting new trials, and providing original review, appellate review, stays of judgments, and providing other types of relief \"in an effort to do what is agreeable to Right and Justice.\" The colonial charters of Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island gave the legislatures the authority of court of last resort. In New Hampshire, judicial appeals were directed to the governor and his council, but routinely referred to the legislature for discussion. And for over half a century, the colonial assembly of Virginia could review court judgments. The involvement of legislatures in judicial matters \"intensified during the American Revolution,\" which \"soon prompted a sense of a sharp necessity to separate the legislative from the judicial power.\" The interference of the legislatures in judicial matters \"figur[ed] prominently in the Framers' decision to devise a system for securing liberty through the division of power.\" This resulted in Article Three of the United States Constitution, which forms the \"central pillar of judicial independence\" and places \"'[t]he judicial Power of the United States' ... in 'one supreme Court', and in such 'inferior Courts'\" as Congress may establish. This judicial power extends \"to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority.\"\n\nThe Chief Justice explained that there are three types of unconstitutional restrictions on the power of the judiciary. \"'Congress cannot vest review of the decisions of Article III courts in officials of the Executive Branch'\", or \"'retroactively command the federal courts to reopen final judgments.'\" In the Chief Justice's view, this case is a third type of unconstitutional interference with the judiciary's authority, \"whereby Congress assumes the role of judge and decides a particular case in the first instance,\" which he believes is precisely what § 8772 does. Section 8772 foreclosed Bank Markazi's defenses that it was immune from prosecution under the FSIA, a separate juridical entity under both U.S. federal common law and international law and thus not liable for Iran's debts, and that New York state law did not permit execution of the plaintiff's judgments against its assets. \"And lest there be any doubt that Congress' sole concern was deciding this particular case ... § 8772 provided that nothing in the statute 'shall be construed ... to affect the availability, or lack thereof, of a right to satisfy a judgment in any other action against a terrorist party in any proceedings other than' [this case].\"\n\nIn the hypothetical case of \"Smith v. Jones\" in which Congress enacted a statute that says \"Smith wins\", the majority would find it unconstitutional because it \"would create no new substantive law.\" In the Chief Justice's view, it would: before the passage of the hypothetical statute, the law did not provide that Smith wins; after passage of the hypothetical statute, it does. For the Chief Justice, \"the question is whether its action constitutes an exercise of judicial power.\" Both the hypothetical \"Smith wins\" statute and § 8772 both have the same effect, which is essentially the legislature's \"'policy judgment'\" that one side in the case wins. He compared the majority's opinion, which found that § 8772 left plenty of issues for the District Court to adjudicate, to \"a constitutional Maginot Line, easily circumvented by the simplest maneuver of taking away every defense against Smith's victory, without saying 'Smith wins.'\" Section 8772 only required the courts to make two decisions—that Bank Markazi had an equitable interest in the assets and no one else did—that were both already clear before § 8772 was enacted. By the majority's view of \"plenty\", the Chief Justice contended that, in the hypothetical case \"Smith v. Jones\", the majority would uphold a judgment for Smith if the court finds that Jones was served notice of the lawsuit and the case was within the statute of limitations. Strongly criticizing the majority, the Chief Justice, quoting \"Federalist No. 48\", concluded that the majority's \"failure to enforce [the boundary between the judicial and legislative branches] in a case as clear as this reduces Article III to a mere 'parchment barrier against the encroaching spirit' of legislative power.\"\n\nFinally, the Chief Justice distinguished this case from \"Dames & Moore\". The actions of the president that \"Dames & Moore\" upheld did not dictate the outcome of the case, but merely specified that the claims be handled by a different tribunal. The court's decision in \"Dames & Moore\" was based on the \"longstanding practice of settling the claims of U.S. nationals against foreign countries by treaty or executive agreement.\" In contrast with the majority's interpretation of \"Dames & Moore\", \"those dispositions, crucially, were not exercises of judicial power.\" The Chief Justice critiqued the majority's position on \"Dames & Moore\" by contending that the political branches of the government—Congress and the executive branch—have sufficient power of their own to address the issues in this case and do not need to \"commandeer[] the courts to make a political decision look like a judicial one.\"\n\nThe Chief Justice concluded with a strong criticism of the majority's decision:\nThe ruling clears the way for the plaintiff-respondents to collect from the roughly $1.75 billion bank account, which will be enough to satisfy about 70% of their collective $2.5 billion in judgments. They will not be eligible to collect from a $1 billion fund—the Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund—established by Congress in 2015 to pay victims of state-sponsored terrorism. That fund pays 30% of judgments until all applicants have received that amount; remaining funds will not be distributed until all claimants have received 30% of their judgment.\n\nAttorney and law professor Alan Morrison, writing for \"The George Washington Law Review\", remarked that:\n\nMorrison expressed \"concern ... that what happened here will repeat itself in other circumstances in which the equities [are] quite different\". Although Morrison suggested that an individual aggrieved by such a law could bring a claim for relief under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, he argued that such a claim is unlikely to be successful because the law will likely be upheld when reviewed under the rational basis test. The rational basis test asks \"there is some rational relationship between disparity of treatment and some legitimate governmental purpose.\"\n\nLaw professor Evan Zoldan, writing in the \"Yale Law & Policy Review Inter Alia\", noted that the ruling allowed Congress to pick a winner in a particular pending case. He wrote that \"By permitting Congress to direct judgment in favor of victims of terrorism, the Bank Markazi Court helped compensate hundreds of people who suffered great tragedies. But, perhaps inadvertently, the Court also conferred on Congress the expansive, and dangerous, power to target an individual for special treatment that is not applied to the population in general.\"\n\nAccording to Stuart Newberger, an attorney who represents terror victims, the ruling could hinder foreign governments from using the judiciary to override determinations by Congress and the President regarding the availability of their assets to satisfy judgments against them. Newberger praised the ruling as \"a message for any country that if Congress and the president take steps to freeze assets, make assets available to victims, that the courts are going to defer.\"\n\nThe decision was praised in the U.S. by the litigants, their counsel, and politicians. Theodore Olson, counsel for the respondents, praised the ruling, saying it \"will bring long-overdue relief to ... victims of Iranian terrorism and their families, many of whom have waited decades for redress.\" Praising the court's decision, lead plaintiff Deborah Peterson found solace that \"in the eyes of the law, we know who is responsible, and those who are responsible have been brought to the justice that we are capable of bringing them to here on earth.\"\n\nLaw professor Jimmy Gurulé said the decision \"sends a powerful message to rogue states and state sponsors of terrorism that if you, directly or indirectly, provide material support for terrorism, you will be held accountable\"—sentiment echoed by Mark Dubowitz, director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies—and that \"hopefully, it's also going to have a deterrent effect, or least cause Iran to think twice about supporting terrorist activity going forward.\" The decision was also praised by Senator Bob Menendez, who authored § 8772, and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan.\n\nA spokesman for Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the ruling as \"theft\", \"incompatible with international law\", \"a ridicule of justice and law\" and stated that Iran \"totally reject[s]\" the ruling. The Iranian Foreign Ministry summoned the Swiss ambassador to Iran, who represents U.S. interests in Iran, to receive diplomatic notes, to be forwarded to the US, protesting the ruling. A week after the decision was announced, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif wrote a letter to Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon urging him to use his good offices to intervene in securing the release of frozen funds and to stop interfering with Iran's international financial transactions. A U.S. State Department spokesman rejected Iran's claims, stating that the State Department \"believe[s] the U.S. laws and the application of those laws by the courts of the United States comport with international law.\"\n\nIran announced that they would file suit against the United States in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for reparations if the U.S. courts begin to \"plunder\" assets from the Citibank account to give to the winning plaintiffs. However, the ICJ may not be able to hear the case. The U.S. withdrew its general recognition of the ICJ's jurisdiction in response to the ICJ's ruling in \"Nicaragua v. United States\", but a 1955 friendship treaty between Iran and the U.S. gives the ICJ jurisdiction to rule on disputes arising from provisions of the treaty. A working group has been established in the Iranian Cabinet to investigate the ruling and determine ways of reestablishing Iran's rights to the account.\n\nLess than a month after the Supreme Court decision, Iran's parliament overwhelmingly approved—181 votes for, 6 votes against, 8 abstentions—an \"emergency bill\" requiring the government to seek compensation from the U.S. for actions the U.S. has taken against Iran, including the 1953 Iranian coup d'état, which the U.S. helped restore the monarch; the Nojeh coup plot in 1980; United States support for Iraq during the Iran–Iraq war, including compensation for over 800,000 Iranians who died or were injured during the conflict; U.S. espionage in Iran; U.S. support of Israel; the alleged death of 17,000 Iranians at the hands of U.S.-supported terrorist groups; and the confiscation of Iranian assets. The bill requires the government to take \"appropriate legal action\" for the violation of Iranian state immunity, including the pursuit of U.S. assets in third countries, and to provide regular updates to parliament on its actions against the US.\n\nSome Iranian officials, including the chief of the Central Bank of Iran (CBI), have placed some blame for the Citibank account's seizure on the previous administration of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who was president of Iran from 2005 to 2013. The Foreign Ministry's director for political and security affairs, Hamid Baidinejad, said it was \"reckless\" for the previous administration to have invested in U.S. securities. In a post on the CBI's website, its chief pointed out that: \"Although CBI experts and senior officials had warned against investing in dollar denominated securities, the government of president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad went ahead and purchased it, thus paving the way for the damage done to our assets.\" Hamid Baeidinejad, a senior Foreign Ministry official, criticized the former head of the CBI for investing in a \"hostile country\".\n\nThe decision came at a delicate time for relations between Iran and Western nations, which were removing sanctions on Iran after its compliance with an agreement for curtailing development of its nuclear enrichment program. The agreement stipulated that once Iranian compliance with the terms of the agreement was verified, most sanctions against Iran would be lifted, including all sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council as well as nuclear-related European Union and U.S. sanctions; U.S. sanctions against Iran for terrorism, human rights abuses, and ballistic missiles would not be affected. In mid-January 2016, most sanctions were lifted. In March, the District Court for the Southern District of New York found, by default, that Iran had provided support to certain terrorist groups and individuals responsible for the September 11 attacks and awarded $10.5 billion in damages to the plaintiffs, which consisted of $3 billion to reimburse insurance companies for paid claims and $7.5 billion for victims and their families ($2 million for pain and suffering and $6.88 million in punitive damages per victim). The same judge ruled just six months earlier that there was insufficient evidence linking Saudi Arabia—which has sour relations with Iran—to the 9/11 attacks to overcome, under the terrorism exemption, Saudi Arabia's immunity under the FSIA.\nThe Supreme Court's decision was announced while Iran's Foreign Minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, was visiting the United States. The week before the decision was announced, the head of the Central Bank of Iran had visited Washington, during the spring meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, to discuss with U.S. and foreign officials problems that remained with Iranian access to international banking, despite the lifting of sanctions.\nJavad Zarif criticized the \"Bank Markazi\" decision and the \"even more absurd\" 9/11 decision by the New York as \"the height of absurdity\". Iranian President Hassan Rouhani called the decisions \"open hostility by the United States against the Iranian people.\"\n\nUnder the nuclear agreement, an important policy objective was to ensure that the Iranian economy benefits from suspending its nuclear weapons program. In the view of commentators Ali Omidi, a professor of international relations at the University of Isfahan, and Saam Borhani, an attorney and commentator on US-Iran relations and sanctions law, the \"Bank Markazi\" decision and the 9/11 case threaten to undermine the nuclear deal and American credibility in negotiations with Iran. The head of the Nuclear Committee in Iran's parliament, Ibrahim Karkhaneh, decried the rulings as \"cooperation between the American Congress, the government and courts to steal Iranian property.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "967212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=967212", "title": "Biological patents in the United States", "text": "Biological patents in the United States\n\nAs with all utility patents in the United States, a biological patent provides the patent holder with the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, or importing the claimed invention or discovery in biology for a limited period of time - for patents filed after 1998, 20 years from the filing date.\n\nUntil recently, natural biological substances themselves could be patented (apart from any associated process or usage) in the United States if they were sufficiently \"isolated\" from their naturally occurring states. Prominent historical examples of such patents on isolated products of nature include adrenaline, insulin, vitamin B, and gene patents. However, the US Supreme Court ruled in 2013 that mere isolation by itself is not sufficient for something to be deemed inventive subject matter.\n\nThe United States has been patenting chemical compositions based upon human products for over 100 years.\nThe first patent for a human product was granted on March 20, 1906, for a purified form of adrenaline. It was challenged and upheld in \"Parke-Davis v. Mulford\". Judge Hand argued that natural substances when they are purified are more useful than the original natural substances.\n\nThe 1970s marked the first time when scientists patented methods on their biotechnological inventions with recombinant DNA. It wasn’t until 1980 that patents for whole-scale living organisms were permitted. In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court, in \"Diamond v. Chakrabarty\", upheld the first patent on a newly created living organism, a bacterium for digesting crude oil in oil spills. The patent examiner for the United States Patent and Trademark Office had rejected the patent of a living organism, but Chakrabarty appealed. As a rule, raw natural material is generally rejected for patent approval by the USPTO. The Court ruled that as long as the organism is truly \"man-made,\" such as through genetic engineering, then it is patentable. Because the DNA of Chakrabarty's organism was modified, it was patentable.\n\nSince that 1980 court case, there has been much patenting of genetically modified organisms. This includes bacteria (as just mentioned), viruses, seeds, plants, cells, and even non-human animals. Isolated and manipulated cells - even human cells - can also be patented. In 1998, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) issued a broad patent claiming primate (including human) embryonic stem cells, entitled \"Primate Embryonic Stem Cells\" (). On 13 March 2001, a second patent () was issued with the same title but focused on human embryonic stem cells. In another example, a genetically modified mouse, dubbed the Oncomouse, that is useful for studying cancer, was patented by Harvard University as .\n\nCompanies and organizations, like the University of California, have patented entire genomes.\n\nAn early example of a food patent is the patent granted to RiceTec for basmati rice in 1997. In 1999, a patent was filed for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich that was without crust. Agriculture giant Monsanto filed for a patent on certain pig genes in 2004.\n\nA gene patent is a patent on a specific isolated gene sequence, its chemical composition, the processes for obtaining or using it, or a combination of such claims. With respect to subject matter, gene patents may be considered a subset of the broader category of biological patents.\n\nGene patents may claim the isolated natural sequences of genes, the use of a natural sequence for purposes such as diagnostic testing, or a natural sequence that has been altered by adding a promoter or other changes to make it more useful. In the United States, patents on genes have only been granted on isolated gene sequences with known functions, and these patents cannot be applied to the naturally occurring genes in humans or any other naturally occurring organism.\n\nThe \"Chakrabarty patent\", owned by General Electric, was filed in 1972 and issued in 1981 after the Supreme Court decision discussed above. While not commercially important, this patent and the Supreme Court case \"opened the floodgates for protection of biotechnology-related inventions and helped spark the growth of an industry.\"\n\nIn 1978 University of California filed a patent application for the cDNA encoding human growth hormone, which issued in 1982 as U.S. Patent No. 4,363,877 and listed Howard M. Goodman, John Shine, and Peter H. Seeburg as inventors. University of California licensed its patent to Lilly, leading to extended litigation among University of California, Lilly, and Genentech; each of Lilly and Genentech had introduced recombinant human growth hormone drugs, which were among the first biotech drugs brought to market.\n\nThe \"Cohen/Boyer patents\" were invented by Stanley Cohen of Stanford University and Herbert Boyer of University of California, San Francisco. The patents cover inventions for splicing genes to make recombinant proteins that are foundational to the biotechnology industry. Stanford managed the patents and licensed them nonexclusively and broadly, earning over $200 million for the universities.\n\nThe \"Axel Patents\" were invented by Richard Axel, Michael H. Wigler, and Saul J. Silverstein of Columbia University. These patents covered cotransformation, a form of transformation, another foundational method of biotechnology; Columbia licensed these patents nonexclusively and broadly and earned about $790 million.\n\nKey methods to manipulate DNA to create monoclonal antibodies are covered by a thicket of patents, including the \"Winter patent\" was invented by Gregory P. Winter of the Medical Research Council which covers methods to make chimeric, humanized antibodies and has been licensed to about fifty companies. Abgenix owned a patent on methods of making transgenic mice lacking endogenous heavy chains. The \"Boss patent\" was owned by Celltech and covered methods of making recombinant antibodies and antibody fragments, together with vectors and host cells useful in these processes. Genentech owned the \"Old Cabilly\" patent that covered altered and native immunoglobulins prepared in recombinant cell culture, as well as the \"New Cabilly\" patent that covers artificial synthesis of antibody molecules. Medarex owned a patent that covered high affinity human antibodies from transgenic mice. These patents have been broadly licensed and have been the subject of litigation among patent holders and companies that have brought monoclonal antibody drugs to market.\n\nA patent application for the isolated BRCA1 gene and cancer-promoting mutations, as well as methods to diagnose the likelihood of getting breast cancer, was filed by the University of Utah, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) and Myriad Genetics in 1994; over the next year, Myriad, in collaboration with investigators from Endo Recherche, Inc., HSC Research & Development Limited Partnership, and University of Pennsylvania, isolated and sequenced the BRCA2 gene, and the first BRCA2 patent was filed in the U.S. by Myriad and other institutions in 1995. Myriad is the exclusive licensee of these patents and has enforced them in the US against clinical diagnostic labs. This means that legally all testing must be done through Myriad's lab or by a lab which it had licensed. This business model led from Myriad being a startup in 1994 to being a publicly traded company with 1200 employees and about $500M in annual revenue in 2012; it also led to controversy and the Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics lawsuit mentioned below. The patents expire, starting in 2014.\n\n\"Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics\" was a 2013 case challenging the validity of gene patents in the United States, specifically challenging certain claims in issued patents owned or controlled by Myriad Genetics that covered isolated DNA sequences, methods to diagnose propensity to cancer by looking for mutated DNA sequences, and methods to identify drugs using isolated DNA sequences.\n\nThe case was originally heard in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, which ruled that all the challenged claims were not patentable subject matter. Myriad then appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The Circuit court overturned the previous decision in part, ruling that isolated DNA which does not exist alone in nature \"can\" be patented and that the drug screening claims were valid, and confirmed in part, finding the diagnostic claims unpatentable. The plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted cert and remanded the case back to the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit did not change its opinion, so on September 25, 2012, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Public Patent Foundation filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court with respect to the second Federal Circuit Decision.\n\nOn November 30, 2012, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the plaintiffs' appeal of the Federal Circuit's ruling. In June 2013, in \"Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics\" (No. 12-398), the court unanimously ruled that, \"A naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature and not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated,\" invalidating Myriad's patents on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. However, the Court also held synthesized DNA sequences, not occurring in nature, can still be eligible for patent protection.\n\nControversy over biological patents occurs on many levels, driven by, for example, concern over the expense of patented medicines or diagnostics tests (against Myriad Genetics with respect to their breast cancer diagnostic test), concerns over genetically modified food which comes from patented genetically modified seeds as well as farmer's rights to harvest and plant seeds from the crops, for example legal actions by Monsanto using its patents.\n\nThe patenting of organisms or extracts from indigenous plants or animals that are already known to local populations has been called biopiracy. Critics say that such patents deny local populations the right to use those inventions, for instance, to grow food.\n\nIn the United States, biological material derived from humans can be patented if it has been sufficiently transformed. In litigation that was famous at the time, a cancer patient, John Moore, sued the University of California. Cancer cells had been removed from Moore as part of his medical treatment; these cells were studied and manipulated by researchers. The resulting cells were \"immortalized\" and were patented by the university as and have become widely used research tools. The subject of the litigation was the financial gain that the university and researchers achieved by additionally charging money to companies by licensing the cell line.\n\nMichael Heller and Rebecca Eisenberg are academic law professors who believe that biological patents are creating a \"tragedy of the anticommons,\" \"in which people underuse scarce resources because too many owners can block each other.\" Others claim that patents have not created this \"anticommons\" effect on research, based on surveys of scientists.\n\nProfessional societies of pathologists have criticized patents on disease genes and exclusive licenses to perform DNA diagnostic tests. In the 2009 Myriad case, doctors and pathologists complained that the patent on BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes prevented patients from receiving second opinions on their test results. Pathologists complained that the patent prevented them from carrying out their medical practice of doing diagnostic tests on patient samples and interpreting the results.\n\nAnother example is a series of lawsuits filed by the Alzheimer’s Institute of America (AIA) starting in 2003 with the last ending in 2013, concerning a gene patent it controlled on the Swedish mutation and transgenic mice carrying it; the mutation that is important in Alzheimers. The mice are widely used in Alzheimer's research, both by academic scientists doing basic research and by companies that use the mice to test products in development. Two of these suits are directed to companies that were started based on inventions made at universities (Comentis and Avid), and in each of those cases, the university was sued along with the company. While none of the suits target universities that are conducting basic research using the mice, one of the suits is against Jackson Labs, a nonprofit company that provides transgenic mice to academic and commercial researchers and is an important repository of such mice. Ultimately all the suits failed; the suit against Jackson Labs failed after the NIH granted it protection as a government contractor.\n\nWhile there is some controversy concerning the patenting of isolated genes and the way those patents are used, and there is controversy concerning patents on the diagnostic uses of genes (the real source of dispute in the Myriad court case), it is difficult to find controversy surrounding patents on genes that are used to manufacture therapeutic proteins (for an example of patents on therapeutic proteins, the drug candidate that is the subject of the early part of the movie 'Extraordinary Measures' was covered in part by a classic gene patent, U.S. Patent No. 6,770,468.) There is also little controversy concerning the role of gene patents in the chemical industry—for instance in the manufacture of enzymes used in consumer products or industrial processes.\n\n"}
{"id": "39191072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39191072", "title": "Bisexual politics", "text": "Bisexual politics\n\nBisexual politics are arguments surrounding individuals who identify as bisexual and their perspectives on issues involving sexuality, equality, visibility and inclusion. Some authors describe \"bisexual politics\" as a form of identity politics.\nOne form of activism within \"bisexual politics\" includes the addition of the word \"bisexual\" onto lesbian and gay organisations (such as the acronym LGB) and fighting employment discrimination for bisexual individuals. However, the political issues as well as the position of bisexuals on these issues are considerably more complex.\n\nNew York University School of Law professor Kenji Yoshino says:\nGays de-legitimatize bisexuals ... the lesbian and gay community abounds with negative images of bisexuals as fence-sitters, traitors, cop-outs, closet cases, people whose primary goal in life is to retain 'heterosexual privilege'.\nThere is an underlying fear that including bisexuals as members in gay rights movements may hurt the movement, either because it is believed that bisexuals \"enjoy heterosexual privilege\", that they had less to lose than lesbian women or gay men, or because their presence lessens the solidarity among gay and lesbian groups in some way. Rather than fence sitters, bisexuals are at further risk for marginalization because they can be ostracized by both straight and gay communities. Writers on bisexuality recognize this danger however, as sociologist Amanda Udis-Kessler, puts it, \"We are not fence-sitters. Let us strive to be bridge-builders\". These concerns are recognized by Lisa Orlando author of \"Loving whom we choose\", who writes:\nWe challenge many people's personal sense of what constitutes sexual identity. Whether we threaten by introducing a third category or by undermining the notion of categories altogether, we cause enough discomfort that many people deny our existence.\nThus, bisexual politics involve, among other issues, the debate over inclusion in both gay and straight movements and cultures.\n\nThe problem of identity centers upon whether bisexuals build an identity around their bisexuality, what being a bisexual means socially, and how it relates to other identities such as feminism. One debate is whether or not it is valuable to establish bisexuality as a sexual identity. As author Jennifer Baumgardner writes:\nIt is feminist to understand bisexuality as its own identity too, because it's a chapter of women's history that has been repressed and misunderstood, and one that has contributed substantially to current ideas about queerness\nHowever the author recognizes that there are also political limitations to identifying as bisexual, saying that:\nThe thing about being bisexual is that you don't really have to be out in the same ways. You can often pass for straight. This can be a weak position politically – how can we organize people around gay rights if we don't identify, and can't be identified by others, as gay?\nOut of this debate, a variety of identity terms have expanded to include the many ideas surrounding this complex issue of identity and sexuality including, \"pansexuality\" (\"omnisexuality\"), \"polysexuality\", and just \"being sexual\".\n\nAmong some critics, a belief is held that bisexual politics is important to equal rights on the basis of \"entitlement\". The term \"entitlement\" here refers specifically to the belief that a bisexual can be and are viewed as straight in some public spheres and thus enjoy the benefits of equality that come along with \"assumed heterosexuality.\" Baumgardner recognizes this view and writes:\nBisexuality [...] contains the liberating potential of aligning with a disparaged (gay and lesbian) group but not being relegated – at least not full-time – to the ghetto. This is the political value of what is called, negatively, entitlement. The political weakness of entitlement (lack of consciousness) have been overstated – as with young feminists – and its potential for change has been neglected [...] Perhaps we need those bridging people on the side of privilege willing to connect the gay and straight worlds- in order to get more done [...] It takes someone who has known relative freedom, who expects it and loves it, to help ignite social change\n\nBisexual politics also involves the arguments surrounding how visible a minority of bisexuals are in society, and how this interacts bisexual activism. It has been said that bisexuals can identify between groups at different times. For example the question, \"When a female bisexual is in a relationship with a man does she cease to become bisexual and alternatively heterosexual?\" and also, \"When the bisexual female abandons her male partner for a female one, can that individual identify as homosexual?\" This belief can lead to issues of visibility in that, a bisexual person may identify with either sexual orientation or alternatively, with neither. Another aspect of this debate is whether bisexuals should operate as visible minorities distinct from homosexuals. As Lani Kaahumanu writes, \"So, why does the attitude exist that there is no bisexual community, and why has it been used against us so effectively? Why have we 'accepted' invisibility, and why haven't we, up to this point, projected a more visible presence, creating a more prominent community that even the most virulent biphobes would have to recognize?\"\n\nInclusion is a main issue with regard to bisexual politics as this group is at risk of being viewed as homosexual by heterosexual groups, and also as \"traitors\" or closeted by the gay and lesbian communities. Lesbian and gay organizations all over the country hotly debate whether or not to include bisexuals in programming and names of groups and events. Author Naiomi Tucker argues:\nBisexuality can be a unifying force in the world. But we must avoid the mistakes of some of our lesbian sisters who profess sexual acceptance [...] [while they] invalidate bisexuality as an orientation [...] If we claim self-definition for ourselves, then we must accord that right to others [...] As a bisexual movement we can create a community where it is safe for everyone to comfortably express their sexuality. As well, a quote from collection of bisexual testimonials puts the issue poignantly \"I very much resented the smugness of lesbians who said my evolution was incomplete [...] Although I understand sexual politics, I could no sooner change my sexual orientation, nor would I want to, any more than a lesbian could.\nInclusion continues to be an issue in bisexual politics, and specifically whether bisexuals represent an additional minority or rather a merging of opposing heterosexual and homosexual groups. Thus bisexual politics considers how bisexuals may offer a bridge by which individuals can reconcile differences and be a positive force in human rights.\n\nThere has been much debate over how to include bisexuality into LGBT communities. Much of this involves the invisibility of the bisexual community. Many people do not fully understand bisexuality. Many members of the bisexual community tend to gravitate more toward either the heterosexual or gay communities. This has led to difficulty in creating visibility for bisexuality because western culture has created a binary of heterosexual or gay, with very few people choosing to live in both communities.\n\n\n"}

Sotheby's and Cobert Finance S.A.", "text": "City of Gotha and Federal Republic of Germany v. Sotheby's and Cobert Finance S.A.\n\nThe City of Gotha and Federal Republic of Germany v. Sotheby's and Cobert Finance S.A. was a September 1998 case in the High Court of England and Wales involving the ownership of a Joachim Wtewael painting. The case was the first reported court decision on section 221 of the German Civil Code (Burgerliches Gesetzbuch). This section involves the limitation of proprietary actions when a third party has acquired possession of the property. The case is important in regards to the concepts of statutes of limitation and acquisitive prescription.\n\nThe case was a consolidation between an action brought by the City of Gotha against Sotheby's and an action brought by Federal Republic of Germany against Cobert Finance S.A.\nThe Federal Republic of Germany and the city of Gotha both claim ownership of the painting and claim that Cobert converted the painting by \"taking constructive delivery of it March 1989, by consigning it to Sotheby's for sale at that time, by offering it for sale through Sotheby's to the City of Gotha in October 1991 and/or by demanding its return from Sotheby's in August 1993\".\n\nThe Duke Family of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha began to buy paintings in 1656. The Joachim Wtewael painting The \"Holy Family with Saints John and Elizabeth\", the painting involved in the case, was featured in an 1826 catalogue of the family's paintings. In July 1905 an act was created declaring that the art collection was part of the estate of the Duke. On 9 November 1918 the workers' and soldiers' council of Gotha deposed of the Duke and the estate was voluntarily dissolved. In November 1927, by an agreement between the Duke and Land of Thuringia the Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, the Foundation for Art and Science (Art Foundation) was created with the purpose of preserving the art collection. The most valuable pieces of the Art Foundation were moved to safety at Reinharsbrunn at the start of the Second World War.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the painting left the collection of the Ducal Family of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha in the city of Gotha. In the 1980s, the painting was arranged to be sold by two art smugglers, Makhin and Greshnikov, to a man named Furst. They arranged the smuggling of the painting from Moscow to West Berlin by Mrs. Dikeni, the wife of the Togo Ambassador in Moscow. She was supposed to deliver the painting to Furst, but did not; and it ended up in the hands of a man named Rohde. The painting was then acquired by Mina Breslav in 1988 and received by Sotheby's on 29 November 1988. The painting was offered for sale and bought by Cobert in March 1989.\n\n1. Whether the Federal Republic of Germany can establish title to the painting and\n\n2. Whether if it can, its claim is time-barred under the German law of limitation\n\nFor the first question to be answered it is needed to find:\n\n1.1 Whether as a matter of fact, it can be established that the painting was in Thuringia in 1945 and 1946;\n\n1.2 Whether title to the painting passed to the Land of Thuringia by virtue of the confiscation police order of 6 July 1945, read with the \nexpropriation Law of 9 October 1945 or, if the painting was still in Thuringia in July 1946, by the operation of the Law of 24 July 1946;\n\n1.3 Whether title to the painting passed to the Land of Thuringia by virtue of the dissolution of the Art Foundation on 14 October 1950;\n\n1.4 Whether an English Court will recognize or enforce the Federal Republic of Germany's title to the painting under German law;\n\n1.5 Whether the arrival of the painting in West Berlin, allegedly via East Germany in 1987 perfects an inchoate expropriation;\n\n1.6 Whether the City of Gotha has a right to possession of the painting.\n\nFor the second question to be answered it is needed to find:\n\n2.1 Whether as a matter of fact the painting was misappropriated by a subsequent possessor after it had been stolen from Gotha;\n\n2.2 Whether the German limitation period is relevant pursuant to Section 1 of the Foreign Limitation Periods Act 1984;\n\n2.3 Whether, if German law is relevant, the right to recover is statute-barred under German law;\n\n2.4 Whether pursuant to Section 2 (1) of the Foreign Limitation Periods Act 1984, the judge should disapply German law, if it bars the claim, on the grounds that it conflicts with English public policy.\n\nTo establish ownership of the painting, it is necessary to rely on laws which only had effect within the region of Thuringia or other territory that the Soviet Military Administration had jurisdiction over. The judge found that the most likely time that the painting was taken, was during the Soviet trophy brigades under Major Alexeyev, when the brigades raided the museum in January 1946. By July 1946 it was confirmed that the painting was gone.\n\nThe judge found that he was required to apply German domestic law as \"the validity of a transfer of a tangible, movable\" piece of property is governed by the law of the country where it is transferred. He stated that the Federal Republic of Germany had to establish title under German law.\n\nThe determination of title is established by legislation passed between July 1945 to July 1946. This legislation concerns confiscation, sequestration and expropriation of property within the area. It is only laws relating to expropriation which have the effect of depriving an owner of title.\n\nThe law of 6 July 1945 confiscated the assets of the house of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. The judge found this law to be legally effective.\n\nThe Law of 9 October 1945 expropriated the assets of Art Foundation of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha which had been confiscated by the 6 July 1945 law.\n\nOrder No. 124 and Order No. 38, passed in 4 December 1945 and 24 July 1946, stated that the law of 9 October 1945 was repealed.\n\nThe judge found that the expropriation of the paintings remained effective. He found that the Law of December 1945 replaced the regime previously existing under the law but did not repeal confiscations carried out before the law of October 1945.\n\nSequestered and confiscated property belonging to the Nazi party and put the assets under the authority of German administrative authorities. The orders expropriated property covered by Order No. 124 and required their delivery to the state of Thuringia.\n\nThe Judge found that if the painting was still in the jurisdiction of the Soviet military administration in July 1946 the law of July 1946 would have expropriated the paintng.\n\nThe Minister of Justice of Thuringia attempted to dissolve the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha Art Foundation on 14 October 1950.\n\nArticle 87 (1) of the German Civil Code states that \"if the fulfillment of the object of the foundation has become impossible, or if it endangers the public interest, the competent authority may give the foundation another stated object or dissolve it\". Article 88 states that on the dissolution of a foundation, the assets pass to the person specified in the constitution. The Constitution of the foundation did not specify a beneficiary. This led to claims that the failure to specify a beneficiary and the absence of a reference to the board of directors confirmed that the dissolution of the foundation was an act of expropriation.\n\nThe judge found that the dissolution of the foundation did not amount to an act of expropriation.\n\nThe Judge found that the seat of the Art Foundation was in Gotha in 1950, that the Ministry of Justice of Thuringia was the competent authority to dissolve the foundation, that the dissolution was not an act of expropriation and that by universal succession, title to the property of the foundation passed to the land of Thuringia.\n\nCobert brought forward the principle that English courts will not recognize a governmental act affecting private property rights when the property is situated outside the territory of that government; and that English courts will not enforce the \"penal, revenue or other public laws of a foreign state\"\n\nThe judge found that the Ministry of Justice's attempt to dissolve the Art Foundation only concerned the status of the Foundation and that English law should recognise the effects of the law.\n\nThe court found that the act of dissolution only concerned the existence of the Foundation, was not an exercise of sovereign authority, and therefore could be recognized under English law.\n\nThe Federal German Republic contended that the painting would have entered the German Democratic Republic in 1987 on its way to West Berlin. The judge found as there was no evidence relating to how the painting entered West Berlin, this was irrelevant.\n\nThe Judge found that the city of Gotha had no claim to possession; and if the Federal German Republic's claim had failed, the city's claim would fail as well. The location of the painting within Gotha does not establish a legal right of the city for possession. The only legal claim to possession would be the assignment of the museum to the city in 1952, but the painting had left the city earlier than that date.\n\nThe court found that the Federal German Republic had title to the painting.\n\nThere was an issue of whether the painting had been misappropriated by Mrs. Dikeni or Rohde.\n\nThe judge looked at various witness testimonies, but questioned their credibility do to their involvement in criminal activities. The judge found that after the painting was given to Mrs. Dikeni, it was not returned; and that Mrs. Dikeni misappropriated the painting in 1987.\n\nThe period of limitation only starts when the painting is purchased in good faith\n\nThe Foreign Limitations Periods Act 1984 Section 1 states:\n\n(1) Subject to the following provisions of this Act, where in any action or proceedings in a court in England and Wales, the law of any other country falls to be taken into account in the determination of any matter\n\na) the law of that other country relating to limitation shall apply in respect of that matter for the purposes of the action or proceedings; and\n\nb)except where the matter falls within subsection (2) below, the law of England and Wales relating to limitation shall not so apply\n\n(2) A matter falls within this subsection if it is a matter in the determination of which both the law of England and Wales and the law of some other country fall to be taken into account\n\nThe judge found that the laws of both Germany and England are applicable and Section 1 (2) of the Act applies.\n\nThe judge found that under German law:\n\n\nThe contention depends on article 221 of the German Civil Code which states:\n\nIf a thing, with regard to which a claim in rem exists, comes by succession into the possession of a third party, the time of prescription which elapsed during the time of possession by the predecessor in title is reckoned in favor of the successor in title\n\nIf article 221 is applicable, the last possessor gains all periods of limitation expired by previous possessors.\n\nProfessor Siehr alleged that the 30 year limitation period had not expired because\n\n1 Article 221 does not apply to a transfer between a bailor to a bailee; and\n\n2 Article 221 does not have effect where a direct possessor misappropriates the asset\n\nA bailee is someone in direct possession, and a bailor after possession is in indirect possession. The judge found that both bailee and bailor could rely upon the limitation period.\n\nThe judge found that if a bailee misappropriates an asset the limitation period which had elapsed is restarted, as the chain of non-proprietary possession has been broken. He found that the limitation period started to run when Mrs. Dikeni misappropriated the painting in 1987 or by Rohde later that year.\n\nThe judge found that if the claim had been barred under German law, it would have been imperative to examine whether this conflicted with English public policy.

It entered into force in 1958 and as of 2013 it has 74 state parties.\n\nBefore the \"Convention on the Nationality of Married Women\", no legislation existed to protect married women's right to retain or renounce national citizenship in the way that men could. Women's rights groups recognized a need to legally protect the citizenship rights of women who married someone from outside their country or nationality. The League of Nations, the international organization later succeeded by the United Nations, was lobbied by women's rights groups during the early 20th century to address the lack of international laws recognizing married women's rights of national citizenship. The Conference for the Codification of International Law, held at The Hague in 1930, drew protests from international women's rights groups, yet the League declined to include legislation enforcing married women's nationality rights. The League took the position that it was not their role, but the role of member states, to deal with equality between men and women.\n\nThe International Women's Suffrage Alliance (IWSA, later renamed the International Alliance of Women) launched a telegram campaign in 1931 to pressure the League of Nations to address the lack of legislation. Women from around the world sent telegrams to the League of Nations as a protest. The League made the concession of creating an unfunded Consultative Committee on Nationality of Women.\n\nThe Pan-American Conference in Montevideo passed a \"Convention on the Nationality of Women\" in 1933.<ref name=\"umn.edu/\"></ref> It was passed by the Pan American Conference at the same time as the \"Treaty on the Equality of Rights Between Men and Women\". These were the first pieces of international law to \"explicitly set sexual equality as a principle to be incorporated into national legislation\" which was required of countries ratifying the convention and treaty. Lobbying by the American National Women's Party has been credited with this legislation. However, neither the International Labour Organization (ILO) nor the League of Nations passed any legislation on the issue during the interwar years.\n\nThe issue of the nationality of married women was a leading women's rights issue facing the United Nations after its establishment. The United Nations Commission on the Status of Women was created, and made it a priority of their agenda, launching a study in 1948. The Commission recommended to the United Nations Economic and Social Council that legislation be drafted to give women equal rights as set out in Article 15 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The \"Convention on the Nationality of Married Women\" entered into force on 11 August 1958.\n\nAs of 2013, the convention has been ratified by 74 states. It has been denounced by the ratifying states of Luxembourg, Netherlands, and United Kingdom.\n\nThe Convention was concluded in the light of the conflicts of law on nationality derived from provisions concerning the loss or acquisition of nationality by women as a result of marriage, divorce, or of the change of nationality by the husband during marriage. It allows women to adopt the nationality of their husband based upon the woman's own decision, but does not require it.\n\nThe Convention seeks to fulfill aspirations articulated in Article 15 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that 'everyone has a right to a nationality' and 'no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his nationality nor denied the right to change his nationality'.\n\nArticle 1\n\nArticle 2\n\nArticle 3\n\n\n"}
{"id": "32362385", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32362385", "title": "Criticism of Confucius Institutes", "text": "Criticism of Confucius Institutes\n\nThe Confucius Institute (CI) program, which began establishing centers for Chinese language instruction in 2004, has been the subject of criticisms, concerns, and controversies during its international expansion.\n\nMany such concerns stem from the CI's relationship to Chinese Communist Party authorities, giving rise to criticisms about undermining academic freedom at host universities, engaging in industrial and military espionage, surveillance of Chinese students abroad, and attempts to advance the Chinese government's political agendas on controversial issues such as human rights in China, Taiwan and Tibet. Additional concerns have arisen over the institutes’ financial and academic viability, teaching quality, and relations with Chinese partner universities.\n\nConfucius Institutes have defended their establishments, comparing them with other cultural promotion organizations such as Alliance française and Goethe-Institut. However, unlike the Alliance francaise or Goethe-Institut, many Confucius Institutes operate directly on university campuses, thus giving rise to unique concerns related to academic freedom and political influence. Some observers have noted that CIs are largely limited to teaching cultural and language programs, and the institutes' staff tend to see political and controversial subjects as human rights and democracy as outside the context of the mission of a Confucius Institute.\n\nThe Confucius Institute program began in 2004 and is financed by the quasi-governmental Office of Chinese Language Council International (colloquially, \"Hanban\"), which is chaired by Politburo member and Vice Premier Liu Yandong, former head of the United Front Work Department. Hanban is governed by \"a council of high state and party officials\" drawn from a variety of party and state ministries including Foreign Affairs, Education, and the State Council Information Office (also known as the \"Office of Foreign Propaganda\") . Marshall Sahlins of the University of Chicago describes Hanban as \"an instrument of the party state operating as an international pedagogical organization.\" The institutes operate in co-operation with local affiliate colleges and universities around the world. The related Confucius Classroom program partners with secondary schools and school districts to provide Chinese language teachers and instructional materials.\n\nThe Confucius Institute has grown rapidly from one campus in Seoul in 2004 to more than 400 worldwide in 2013, and opposition to the program \"has grown almost as dramatically.\" Critics have accused CIs of having restrictive hiring practices and \"spreading propaganda\" about issues such as the legitimacy of the Taiwanese state and origins of the Korean War.\n\nIn evidence of the \"spectacular proliferation\" of CIs, Lionel Jensen notes they have become so familiar in the United States a segment of The Daily Show made a parody out of a community group's opposition to the CI teaching Mandarin in a public school.\n\nConfucius Institutes’ stated missions are to promote knowledge of Chinese language and culture abroad, as well as to promote commercial and trade cooperation. In the context of the Chinese Communist Party's foreign policy objectives, the institutes serve as tools of cultural diplomacy intended to bolster China's soft power abroad.\n\nOfficial Communist Party literature describes the Institutes in the context of Hu Jintao’s soft power initiatives, designed to influence perceptions of China and its policies abroad. Li Changchun, the 5th-highest-ranking member of the Politburo Standing Committee, was quoted in \"The Economist\" saying the Institutes were \"an important part of China’s overseas propaganda set-up\".\n\n\"The Economist\" notes China \"has been careful not to encourage these language centres to act as overt purveyors of the party’s political viewpoints, and little suggests they are doing so\", but also noted the important goal of give the world a \"correct\" understanding of China, as well as efforts in opposing Chinese dissident groups abroad, such as Tibetan independent activists, democracy groups and the Falun Gong.\n\nCiting what are called the Hanban's three \"T-words\" (Taiwan, Tibet, and Tiananmen) that are anathema for discussion at Confucius Institutes, Alan H. Yang and Michael Hsiao said the straightforward mission and goal of CIs is \"to improve and reshape the image of China\" as \"recalibrated and discoursed by Beijing government.\"\n\nLionel M. Jensen, associate professor of East Asian languages and cultures from the University of Notre Dame, while noting \"so far there have not been any events in which the academic freedom of the host university was explicitly threatened by authorities of Hanban\", expressed concerns regarding the CI's educational objectives and quality of teaching. Jensen said the Hanban has reduced the diversity of China's cultures to a \"uniform, quaint commodity\", characterized by Chinese opera and dance performances, which he calls \"culturetainment\", meaning \"the abridgment of Chinese civilization in the name of digestible forms of cultural appeal can be readily shipped overseas.\"\n\nRandolph Kluver, Director of the Confucius Institute at Texas A&M University, said that the soft power paradigm was inadequate for understanding CIs, which could better be understood within a \"communicative paradigm\" of bringing China's cultural resources into a global conversation about values, politics, and culture. Kluver concluded that despite the Chinese government's attitude, Confucius Institutes had little impact on attitudes towards Chinese political agendas.\n\n\"The New York Times\" foreign correspondent Jane Perlez reported that the 2013 Pew Global Attitudes Project survey revealed China's approval rating in the United States had dropped 14 percentage points in two years, to the lowest rating for China in any region of the world. Perlez cited an article in the \"Journal of Contemporary China\" by Tao Xie, a professor of political science at Beijing Foreign Studies University, who said in an interview that his analysis \"was rejected by Chinese academic publications because it criticized the Confucius Institutes that the Chinese government has opened in many countries.\" Professor Tao statistically analyzed data from the 2007 Pew Global Attitudes survey for factors that affect cross-national variations in China's national image. Presuming that Chinese foreign direct investment would increase positive public perceptions of China among recipients, Tao tested and disproved a hypothesis that \"the number of Confucius institutes in a country should be positively related to favorable opinions about China among that country’s people.\" Tao methodologically notes that the number of institutes many be endogenous in statistical terms, because the Hanban has opened most CIs in Europe and North America, \"where perceptions of China have been the most unfavorable\". Professor Tao concludes that the data reveal, \"the Confucius institutes and classrooms have not succeeded in reversing the rather negative image of China in most of the countries where they are located.\"\n\nAddressing a 2014 Dublin conference for European CIs, Liu Yunshan, Director of the Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China, said Confucius Institutes had emerged at the right moment, and described them as a \"spiritual high-speed rail\" [心灵高铁], promoting friendship by connecting \"Chinese dreams\" with those of the rest of the world.\n\nA number of criticisms surrounding the Confucius Institutes stem from their relationships with the Chinese government, through the Office of Chinese Language Council International or \"Hanban\". The Hanban website states that Confucius Institutes and Classrooms are non-profit educational institutions, but they have close ties to several senior Communist Party officials, including the current Hanban chair and Politburo member Liu Yandong, who was formerly head of the United Front Work Department. The Hanban members encompass twelve Chinese government institutions, from the Ministry of Education to the State Council Information Office (or \"Office of Foreign Propaganda\") and the National Development and Reform Commission, \"through organizations dealing with Finance, Overseas Chinese, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Trade, Culture and all the media organizations.\" \"United Front Work\" is a concept that harks back to the Chinese civil war and refers to \"Beijing’s efforts to identify friends and isolate enemies. The logic here is that true friends will identify and isolate enemies from the CCP, while hiding any hint of direct involvement by the Party itself.\" Steven W. Mosher, president of the Population Research Institute, testified the United Front Work Department's purpose \"is subversion, cooption and control,\" and claimed one of the CI's chief purposes is \"to subvert, coopt, and ultimately control Western academic discourse on matters pertaining to China.\"\n\nAn article from the state-run \"China Daily\" said that \"Confucius Institutes' work is misunderstood from time to time,\" citing the example of Mosher calling CIs \"Trojan Horses with Chinese characteristics.\" In response, Xu Lin, director-general of the Hanban, said, \"The Confucius Institutes are definitely not Trojan Horses, since we are holding no weapons in our hands.\" An \"Asian Survey\" article notes concerns over a \"Trojan horse effect\" of CIs. \"The Confucius Institute project can be seen at one level as an attempt to increase Chinese language learning and an appreciation of Chinese culture, but at another level it is part of a broader soft power projection in which China is attempting to win hearts and minds for political purposes.\" Besides CIs, some other ways China raises its cultural profile overseas include Chinese contemporary art exhibitions, television programs, concerts by popular singers, and translations of Chinese literature.\n\nAccording to Fabrice De Pierrebourg and Michel Juneau-Katsuya, a number of individuals holding positions within the Confucius Institute system have backgrounds in Chinese security agencies and United Front Work Department, \"which manages important dossiers concerning foreign countries. These include propaganda, the control of Chinese students abroad, the recruiting of agents among the Chinese diaspora (and among sympathetic foreigners), and long-term clandestine operations.\"\n\nA declassified intelligence report by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) says, \"Beijing is out to win the world's hearts and minds, not just its economic markets, as a means of cementing power.\" In an interview on CBC Television, Richard Fadden, director of the CSIS, said that while China was funding Confucius Institutes in most of the campuses across Canada, they were \"managed by people operating out of the embassy or consulates\" who had organized \"demonstrations to deal with what are called the five poisons: Taiwan, Falun Gong and others\". Stockholm's Institute for Security and Development Policy described the founding of CIs as \"an image management project, the purpose of which is to promote the greatness of Chinese culture while at the same time counterattacking public opinion which maintains the presence of a 'China threat' in the international community.\"\n\nAlthough the number of Indian students taking Chinese language courses is on the increase, the Ministry of External Affairs rejected the idea of establishing Confucius Institutes in schools, as they were \"using culture to spread propaganda and influence.\" Of the more than 17 CIs launched in Japan since 2005, all were at private colleges, instead of at more prestigious national universities. \"Chinese culture traditionally holds significant influence in Japan, but people remain concerned by the potential ideological and cultural threat of Chinese government-run projects such as CIs.\"\n\nA \"Der Spiegel\" article about threats from China's soft power criticized Beijing for using Confucius Institutes \"in hopes of promoting what it views as China's cultural superiority\". German sinologists disagree about the degree of government control over the system. Jörg-Meinhard Rudolph from the East Asia Institute (Ludwigshafen) noted no German political party had financed any educational institutions in German universities, \"yet they are accepting money from the undemocratic Chinese Communist Party.\" Michael Lackner, deputy head of the Confucius Institute at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, described the influence of German universities and said, \"I am not sure whether Confucius Institute Headquarters really know what Chinese culture is. Thus, German academics could help define Chinese culture as a world culture.\"\n\nAt a hearing of the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Anne-Marie Brady, a University of Canterbury political science professor, testified that China considers propaganda work the \"life blood of the Party-State in the current era\", and promotes foreign propaganda towards the Overseas Chinese community through Confucius Institutes and activities such as \"root-seeking\" cultural tours. Three years later, Professor Brady analogized, \"If we had a U.S. government agency that was stating that it was a tool for U.S. government propaganda, my colleagues would be up in arms about having a center like that on campus.\"\n\nThere has also been criticism over the Communist Party's appropriation of Confucius. Under Mao Zedong, Confucian values and teachings were perennial targets of criticism and suppression, being viewed as vestiges of feudalism. According to \"Asia Times Online\", the Chinese Communist Party under Mao Zedong criticized Confucian teachings as \"rubbish that should be thrown into the 'Ash heap of history'\" while the 21st-century CCP uses Confucianism as \"an assistant to the Chinese god of wealth (and a representative of Chinese diplomacy), but not a tutor for Chinese soul.\"\n\nConfucius Institutes are frequently compared to cultural associations such as the UK's British Council, Germany's Goethe-Institut, France's Alliance Française, Italy's Società Dante Alighieri, and Spain's Instituto Cervantes. For instance, an editorial in the state-owned \"China Daily\" newspaper accused CI opponents of double standards for not calling \"Goethe-Institut, Alliance Française or Cervantes Institutes propaganda vehicles or tools of cultural invasion\". The editorial noted that \"China is not the first to set up such institutes nor does it have a monopoly over overseas cultural promotion.\"\n\nHowever, unlike the aforementioned organizations, the CI model is attachment to universities or other educational institutions, thus leading to suspicions the institutes are \"aimed less at fostering interest in China and Chinese culture itself, and more at ensuring that such interest is guided along lines approved of by the Chinese party-state.\" Steven Mosher notes: \"Unlike Alliance Francaise, the Confucius Institutes are not independent from their government; unlike the Goethe-Institut establishments, they do not occupy their own premises. Instead, participating universities agree to provide office space in exchange for funding, and to cede academic control to the United Front Work Department of the Chinese Communist Party.\" Martin Davidson, chief executive of the British Council, criticized comparisons between his institution and CIs. \"We are a stand-alone organization operating out of our own premises. They are being embedded in university campuses. The real question has to be one of independence.\" Davidson said while the Chinese are very clear about wanting to combat negative propaganda with positive propaganda, \"The danger is more of self-censorship — which is a very subtle thing.\"\n\nJocelyn Chey, a former diplomat and expert in Australia-China relations, stated the Confucius Institutes are more closely managed by its government compared with its French counterpart. She believes the institute's program is most valuable where it supports culture and outreach into the community. Chey however states CI is \"a propaganda vehicle for the Chinese communist party, and not a counterpart to the Goethe Institute or Alliance Française\", and speculates the close links between the institutes and the Chinese Communist Party \"could lead at best to a 'dumbing down' of research and at worst could produce propaganda.\" On the other hand, \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" cites a Queensland University of Technology student that \"It would be best to understand [Confucius institutes] not as 'propaganda tools' but as 'one instrument of China's cultural diplomacy to wield and bolster Chinese soft power globally'\".\n\nConfucius Institutes also bear similarities to the Chinese Students and Scholars Association which has come under criticism for interference by the Chinese government on American university campuses.\n\nConfucius Institutes mostly run a small number of classes, with an average budget of US$400,000 per institute in 2009. They are funded jointly by grants from China's Ministry of Education and funds from host universities; although Hanban set a financial objective for self-sufficiency within five years, many CIs have struggled. David Shambaugh says Confucius Institute funding \"is in fact laundered through the MOE from the CCPPD’s [i.e., CCP Propaganda Department's] External Propaganda Department\".\n\nDavid Prager Branner, a Chinese professor at Columbia University, warns that taking money from China to set up Confucius Institutes could have long-term consequences and questions whether it would be in America's national interest. Some critics have suggested Beijing's contributions to host universities gives Chinese authorities too much leverage over those institutions. The sizeable grants coming with the establishment of Confucius Institutes could make universities more susceptible to pressures from Beijing to exercise self-censorship, particularly on Chinese human rights issues or other politically sensitive topics. \"The Economist\" points out that some Chinese language courses at Confucius Institutes are even paid for by the Pentagon under the National Security Language Initiative.\n\nIn January 2010, the Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China announced that the winning bid (CEIECZB01-09JX033) to build and maintain the Confucius Institute Online website was awarded to the Hanban subsidiary company Wuzhou Hanfeng Web Technology Ltd. (Wuzhou Hanfeng Wangluo Keji 五洲汉风网络科技) for 35.2 million \"yuan\" (US$5.7 million), which was called \"the most expensive website in history\" (\"史上最贵网站\"). Chinese and foreign media outlets reported that Wuzhou Hanfeng Web Technology Ltd. was registered to Wang Yongli 王永利, Deputy Director-General of Hanban and Deputy Chief Executive of Confucius Institute Headquarters, and criticized the Hanban's lack of transparency and corruption. In response, Hanban Director-General Xia Jianhui 夏建辉 said \"the website will eventually be made into a learning portal that will be promoted globally, this is a comprehensive project\", and maintained that the Hanban did not break any rules by allowing their own subsidiary company to win the contract.\n\nMaria Wey-Shen Siow, East Asia bureau chief of Channel NewsAsia, wrote in the East-West Center’s \"Asia Pacific Bulletin\" the concerns over Confucius Institutes projecting political undertones \"are not completely unfounded, but may not be totally warranted.\" She highlights, for all the CI controversies, \"Han Ban’s annual budget was only US$145 million in 2009 so it would be false to state China has been spending massively on these institutes.\" Lionel Jensen writes, \"According to a 2006 BBC report, the Chinese government initially committed $10 billion for operating the Confucius Institute program.\"\n\nIn a 2010 Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Senator Richard Lugar asked Secretary of State Hillary Clinton why China had established 60 Confucius Institutes in the United States but only permitted 4 comparable US cultural centers in China, and she replied, \"The Chinese government provides each center with a million dollars to launch, plus they cover operating expenses that exceed $200,000 per year. We don't have that kind of money in the budget.\"\n\nSome critics, including within China, have expressed worry \"the government’s support for the CIs' budgets detracts from domestic spending\" when the Ministry of Education \"budget for domestic compulsory education remains inadequate.\" Swedish parliamentarian Göran Lindblad asked why Chinese authorities are subsidizing Western educational institutions when \"China has ten million children without proper schools.\"\n\nFinancing for the Confucius Institute at the London School of Economics came under criticism following the \"LSE Gaddafi links\" controversy over accepting a £1.5 million donation from Libya. Christopher Hughes, professor of international relations, said the school's acceptance of about £400,000 from China showed it had failed to learn from the scandal. Hughes accused the CI of being a \"divisive\" and \"illegitimate\" propaganda organization, and said its existence would damage the school's reputation. In reference to Hughes, Liu Xiaoming, Chinese ambassador to the United Kingdom, accused CI critics of clinging to \"outdated 'cold war' mentality\"; to which Hughes replied that it was \"gross interference\" for Liu to complain about an internal LSE discussion on ethics.\n\nOn 10 June, Hughes emailed colleagues discussing CI teaching materials a link to an animated video, in Chinese with English subtitles, on the official Confucius Institute Online website. It was titled \"The War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea\" (which is the Chinese official name \"Kangmeiyuanchao zhanzheng\" 抗美援朝战争 for \"Korean War) and summarized the Korean War with negative historical revisionism. Specifically, the film \"declares that the Chinese were provoked into entering the war because the United States had bombed Chinese villages near the Korean border, and had manipulated the UN Security Council into passing a resolution that enabled American troops to expand aggression against Korea.\" After the video link began circulating on Twitter, the CI website deleted the webpage on June 11, but cache copies remain available. This educational animation was part of an online \"Chinese history\" course under the CI homepage's \"Chinese Learning for Kids ＆ Teens\" section. The censored video claimed the \"United States manipulated the UN Security Council … to enlarge the aggression against Korea\" and \"tried to seize the whole peninsula\"; in response, Chinese \"volunteers\" from the People's Liberation Army joined the fight and \"crushed the imperialists' aggressive ambitions\", which \"enhanced China’s international prestige\" in the Korean War.\n\nA 2012 article in \"The Atlantic\" questions whether China has squandered the soft-power money spent on CIs and expensive CCTV-4 America studios when wealthy Chinese are seeking exit visas to the US; asking, \"What good are Confucius Institutes … when many of your country's elites are voting with their feet and hedging against domestic unpredictability?\"\n\n\"The Economist\" describes the Hanban's spending on CIs as \"considerable, and growing rapidly\". In 2013 it was $278m, more than six times as much as in 2006. China's funding for Confucius Institutes amounts to about $100,000-200,000 a year on many campuses, and sometimes more.\nAccording to an article in Foreign Policy, many Chinese view this $278 million expenditure for an overseas soft-power initiative as a waste of money, which would be better spent on building schools in poor rural areas of China.\n\nCritics of Confucius Institutes have cited concerns it could serve as a vehicle for industrial and military espionage, as well as for surveillance of Chinese students studying abroad. The intelligence services of several countries have investigated Confucius Institutes, including the Canadian organization CSIS. David Matas said that \"informally [the institutes] become a vehicle the Chinese government uses to basically intimidate the academic institutions to run according to their guise and also as a vehicle for infiltration and spying into the campuses to find out what's going on hostile to their interest.\"\n\nPierrebourg and Juneau-Katsuya also raised concerns over ties between Confucius Institute administrators and large state-run Chinese companies. For instance, they point to the Confucius Institute at the University of Texas at Dallas, where one of the top officials is also vice-president of Huawei, a Chinese telecom company the U.S. government regards as a national security threat, and which has been accused of industrial espionage, though an extensive security review found no clear evidence of spying.\n\nThe \"People's Daily\" reports Osaka Sangyo University, which opened a Confucius Institute and closed it after one year of operation, formally apologized for an employee who called the CI \"a spy agency established to gather cultural intelligence.\"\n\nConfucius Institutes are described as transmitting political influence in a \"sublimely veiled manner\". Canada's \"Globe and Mail\" reported, \"Despite their neutral scholarly appearance, the new network of Confucius Institutes does have a political agenda.\" For example, teaching with the simplified Chinese characters used in the PRC rather than the Traditional Chinese characters used in Taiwan \"would help to advance Beijing’s goal of marginalizing Taiwan in the battle for global inﬂuence.” An article in \"China Heritage Quarterly\" criticizes teaching only simplified characters in the context of Confucius Institutes as \"semi-literacy in Chinese\". In response to the PRC's CI program, the Republic of China announced plans in 2011 to establish \"Taiwan Academies\" in America, Europe, and Asia as part of its cultural diplomacy. The Taiwan Academy program is designed to promote \"Taiwanese-favored\" Mandarin Chinese, traditional Chinese characters, and Taiwanese topics. Marshall Sahlins also makes this claim about simplified characters, which scholars have disputed; George Washington University historian Edward McCord says many Chinese language departments teach simplified characters of their own volition, and Lewis & Clark College anthropologist Jennifer Hubbert says Sahlins overlooked the fact that most trained sinologists can read Chinese in both character sets, and training in one does not preclude access to the other.\n\nPeng Ming-min, a Taiwan independence activist and politician, writes although on the surface China merely demonstrates its \"soft power\" through CIs, \"Colleges and universities where a Confucius Institute is established all have to sign a contract in which they declare their support for Beijing’s “one China” policy. As a result, both Taiwan and Tibet have become taboos at these institutes.\" Peng lists other examples of CI \"untouchable\" issues including the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, neglect of human rights, environmental pollution in China, and the imprisonment of Liu Xiaobo. However, BC lawyer and China expert Clive Ansley said there were \"troubling signs of [China's] growing influence on western campuses\" before Confucius Institutes were established. He saw signs the public discussions about certain human-rights issues were being self-censored, out of fear of losing out on intake of Chinese students.\n\nMichael Nylan, professor of Chinese history at the University of California at Berkeley, says CIs have become less heavy-handed in their demands, and have learned from \"early missteps,\" such as insisting universities adopt a policy Taiwan is part of China. Nylan took an informal survey of faculty and administrators at fifteen universities with Confucius Institutes; \"two respondents reported that institutes had exerted pressure to block guest speakers,\" but both events went ahead anyway.\n\nTaiwan is one of the few major countries that do not have Confucius Institutes, and scholars from Academia Sinica's Center for Asia-Pacific Area Studies carried out a two-year research project to collect empirical evidence on CIs. The project leader Michael Hsiao (蕭新煌), chairperson of Academia Sinica's Institute of Sociology, said he learned the implicit rules about off-limit topics—Taiwan, Tibet, the Dalai Lama, the Tiananmen Square massacre, and Falun Gong—during interviews with staff at CI host institutions in Southeast Asian countries and in the US. Hsiao called the Hanban's rapid expansion of Confucius Institutes into over 105 countries \"a smart move,\" but also mentioned that CI criticisms have arisen in at universities worldwide. \"People in favor of the institutes say they bring in revenue and provide opportunities for students to learn Chinese. Those opposed to the initiative worry they place limitations on academic freedom and dislike the political machinations behind them.\"\n\nThe historian Yu Ying-shih received the inaugural Tang Prize in Sinology in 2014. At the awards ceremony, he criticized the CCP's promotion of Confucianism and establishment of 465 Confucius Institutes worldwide as \"all propaganda with political purposes\".\n\nJonathan Zimmerman critically framed the question of Confucius Institutes and academic freedom, \"Let's suppose that a cruel, tyrannical, and repressive foreign government offered to pay for American teens to study its national language in our schools. Would you take the deal?\" Zimmerman concluded that more Americans should study Chinese, but \"on our own terms, making sure that it also reflects our best civic language of freedom, open discussion, and democracy.\" Chinese history professor Jonathan Lipman from Mount Holyoke College expressed the dilemma of accepting CI funding thus: \"By peddling a product we want, namely Chinese language study, the Confucius Institutes bring the Chinese government into the American academy in powerful ways. The general pattern is very clear. They can say, 'We'll give you this money, you'll have a Chinese program, and nobody will talk about Tibet.' In this economy, turning them down has real costs.\" Professor Terry Russell at the University of Manitoba questioned the Hanban's real motivation, fearing the university would not be able to organize certain activities judged \"sensitive\" to the Chinese, such as bringing the Dalai Lama onto campus. He said, \"'We have a real conflict of our principles of academic freedom,' with the potential to have a faculty version of Chinese history and a Confucius Institute version being taught on campus.\" According to Cameron Morrill, president of the University of Manitoba Faculty Association, \"It is inappropriate to allow any government, either foreign or domestic, control over a university classroom, regardless of how much money they offer.\" The university later decided against taking Chinese government money to set up CIs.\n\nIn 2010, the University of Oregon \"came under – and resisted – pressure from the Chinese consul general in San Francisco\" to cancel a lecture by Peng Ming-Min (see above). Glenn Anthony May, a UO history professor wrote an article expressing concerns that Confucius Institutes \"come with visible strings attached.\" For instance, host institutions must sign a memorandum of understanding to support the One-China policy. \"At universities, we normally have an opportunity to debate issues like that, allowing professors like me and students to take issue publicly with our government's policy. Hanban, for obvious reasons, wants no such discussion to occur.\" Meiru Liu, director of the Confucius Institute at Portland State University, rejects May's criticisms CIs hinder open discussions of issues such as the treatment of political activist Liu Xiaobo. Meiru Liu explained that while Falun Gong, dissidents and 1989 Tiananmen Square protests are not topics the Confucius Institute headquarters would like to see organized by the institutes, they are \"not major interest and concerns now by general public at large here in the US.\" Fellow UO professor and CI director Bryna Goodman countered May, noting the local Confucius Institute hosted forums on sensitive topics such as China's internet censorship and economic regulations, and \"We haven't gotten any topic that has been proposed to us that we have considered out of bounds.\"\n\nThe establishment of some Confucius Institutes has been opposed or blocked by faculty members at universities. Faculty at the University of Pennsylvania decided not to negotiate with CI due to fears of meddling in course curriculum. Members of the Chinese studies department at the University of Melbourne forced the institute off the main campus. Faculty at Stockholm University demanded the separation of the Nordic Confucius Institute from the university, but an independent assessment rejected their claims that the Chinese Embassy in Stockholm was using the CI for conducting political surveillance and inhibiting academic freedom.\n\nIn writing for the \"Christian Science Monitor\", Jonathan Zimmerman, a historian at New York University, warned that Confucius Institutes resemble the 1930s \"Mussolini model\" of financing Italian language schools in America for Fascist propaganda purposes.\n\nA major concern of Confucius Institutes is their response to politically-sensitive and controversial material such as human rights and Taiwan. Meiru Liu, director of the Confucius Institute at Portland State University, states the local institute had sponsored lectures on Tibet, China's economic development, currency, and US-China relations. Mary E. Gallagher, director of the Center for Chinese Studies at the University of Michigan, said the institutes has been free in covering \"that are controversial and sensitive in China\". In particular, the Confucius Institute in Edinburgh promoted a talk by a dissident Chinese author whose works are banned in China.\n\nLionel M. Jensen, professor of East Asian Languages and history at the University of Notre Dame, said, \"Every Confucius Institute is a spectacular experiment in cultural outreach\", but \"the placement of institutes within the centers, departments, and institutes of public and private universities is \"without precedent\", and threatens the independent pursuit of research that is the enabling premise of higher education.\"\n\nIn June 2014, the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) called on American universities, almost a hundred of which have Confucius Institutes, to reexamine the price they are paying in academic freedom. The AAUP's Report on academic freedom stated, \"Confucius Institutes function as an arm of the Chinese state and are allowed to ignore academic freedom.\"\n\nA 21 June 2014 editorial in \"The Washington Post\" listed recent concerns about Confucius Institutes, including the AAUP advising universities to cut ties with CIs unless Hanban agreements are renegotiated, alleged violations of freedom of speech and human rights, and the secrecy of undisclosed contracts between schools and the Hanban. It concluded that \"academic freedom cannot have a price tag\", and recommended that if universities will not publish their CI agreements, the programs should end. The official Chinese news agency Xinhua \"hit back with an angry editorial\" on 24 June, saying the claims by the AAUP and others that CIs \"function as an arm of the Chinese state and are pushing political agendas\", actually \"expose not so much communist propaganda as their own intolerance of exotic cultures and biased preconceived notions to smear and isolate the CPC\".\n\nColumbia University received $1 million in Hanban funds over five years, to begin a CI. Professor Robert Barnett, the director of the Modern Tibetan Studies Program, described a \"strange silence about Tibet and other sensitive issues when it comes to Columbia, academics, and talks of China.\" Barnett said, \"The issue is not China wants to promote itself and pay for Chinese to be taught. The issue is it wants to have a presence in the campus and much more than that. It wants to have a presence in the faculty and in teaching departments.\" Lening Liu, director of the Confucius Institute at Columbia, said that it was \"committed to academic integrity and that it would reject any attempt by Hanban to censor its research.\" Other academics have questioned how universities should respond when foreign governments limit academic freedom abroad. Since the 2001 publication of Columbia University professor Andrew J. Nathan's \"Tiananmen Papers\", he and several other faculty members have been denied visas to China, and the Chinese government shut down the Modern Tibetan Studies Program's study abroad program in Tibet.\n\nOver 170 University of Chicago faculty members petitioned president Robert Zimmer against the establishment, without Faculty Senate approval, of a CI as well as a Milton Friedman Institute for Research in Economics. The petition called Confucius Institutes \"an academically and politically ambiguous initiative\" sponsored by the PRC, and said the university risked having its own reputation used to \"legitimate the spread\" of CIs in the United States and around the world.\n\nIn late October 2013, Marshall Sahlins, a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, published the article \"China U: Confucius Institutes censor political discussions and restrain the free exchange of ideas. Why, then, do American universities sponsor them?\" arguing that universities like the University of Chicago should take the lead in cancelling the arrangement. Writing in \"Forbes\", the Irish journalist Eamonn Fingleton says, \"In one of the most scandalous sell-outs in intellectual history, more and more universities now accept funding from the Beijing Ministry of Education\". He calls the CI program a \"Chinese mega-blooper\", and says that largely thanks to Sahlins’ leadership, \"academic staff at many universities have begun agitating to rid campuses of the phenomenon.\"\n\nIn 2014, Professor Sahlins wrote \"Confucius Institutes: Academic Malware\" because incidents of academic malpractice in CIs, \"from the virtually unnoticeable to the publicly notorious, are disturbingly common\". Sahlins told the \"Times Higher Education\" that his book did not represent some sort of \"rabid anti-communism of a McCarthyite or Cold War sort – as defenders of Confucius Institutes have claimed\", but rather, the issue is the preservation of the \"values of academic freedom and intellectual autonomy upon which universities in the US and most of the world are founded.\"\n\nAccording to a \"Chronicle of Higher Education\" article, since the first Confucius Institute in the United States was established at the University of Maryland in 2004, \"there have been no complaints of the institutes' getting in the way of academic freedom on American campuses\"; the same article goes on to say that the Institutes are \"distinct in the degree to which they were financed and managed by a foreign government.\"\n\nStanford University was initially offered $4 million to host a CI and endow a Confucius Institute Professorship in Sinology, but Hanban requested that the professor not discuss \"delicate issues\". After Stanford refused based on academic freedom grounds, Hanban accepted making an unrestricted gift, and the university plans to use the money for a professorship in classical Chinese poetry. Dean Richard Saller, who is also the CI director, explained the Hanban prizes the Stanford relationship too much to jeopardize it by interfering with academic freedom.\n\nIn 2009, North Carolina State University cancelled a planned appearance by the Dalai Lama to speak on its Raleigh campus, citing concerns about a Chinese backlash and a shortage of time and resources. Provost Warwick Arden said \"China is a major trading partner for North Carolina,\" and a CI presents an \"opportunity for subtle pressure and conflict.\" However, in 2010, the Dalai Lama spoke at Stanford University and Miami University (Ohio) – both institutions have Confucius Institutes.\n\nOn 28 March 2012, the United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations held a hearing on \"The Price of Public Diplomacy with China,\" focusing upon Chinese propaganda efforts in the U.S., including Confucius Institutes on university campuses. Representative Dana Rohrabacher said, \"The two pillars of America’s status as an open society are freedom of the press and academic freedom. Communist China, which does not believe in or allow the practice of either type of freedom, is exploiting the opportunities offered by America to penetrate both private media and public education to spread its state propaganda.\" Steven W. Mosher testified, \"there have been allegations of Confucius Institutes undermining academic freedom at host universities, engaging in industrial and military espionage, monitoring the activities of Chinese students abroad, and attempting to advance the Chinese Party-State’s political agenda on such issues as the Dalai Lama and Tibet, Taiwan independence, the pro-democracy movement abroad, and dissent within China itself.\" Responding to Mosher's testimony, Rohrabacher argued, \"It appears as though Beijing is able to expand its campaign against academic freedom from China to America when U.S. universities value Chinese favors and money more than truth and integrity.\"\n\nThe US Department of State issued a 17 May 2012 directive stating that the Chinese professors at university-based CIs were violating their J-1 visas by teaching in schools at the precollege level and would have to return to China by 30 June to apply for a new visa. In addition, the institutes would be required to obtain US academic accreditation. Chinese officials reportedly applied pressure on Washington in response. On 24 May, State Department spokesperson Victoria Nuland said there was \"a mess-up in the processing in general\" and called the original directive \"sloppy and incomplete.\" The State Department said it would arrange the appropriate visa categories for Chinese teachers, without them needing to leave the country and re-apply. Chinese state media reacted strongly to the initial announcement, with \"Global Times\" editorializing that, \"the promotion of Chinese language and culture by Confucius Institutes makes some Americans uneasy.\" Xu Lin, head of the Hanban, told a CI conference in Edinburgh, \"The US government hurt our feelings, but Confucius Institutes across Europe have done a great job, especially with cultural promotion, which is not surprising given Europe's rich history and culture.\"\n\nIn April 2014, over 100 professors at the University of Chicago signed a petition calling for a University Senate Council vote against renewing the university's CI contract, saying that the Hanban's control of hiring and training teachers \"subjects the university’s academic program to the political constraints on free speech and belief that are specific to the People’s Republic of China.\" The CI director Dali Yang denied these charges and said, \"Our Confucius Institute does not offer classes of its own; the teachers participate in the University of Chicago Chinese language program.\" Marshall Sahlins said that if the U. of C. withdrew from the Confucius Institutes, other universities \"will think twice about joining or renewing their contracts.\"\n\nMedia widely reported on this protest by U. of C. faculty. Historian Bruce Cumings, who signed the petition, noted that China had recently fired prominent faculty members for their political views, and warned, \"American universities should not be taking money or institute funds from governments that are jailing professors and that do not provide academic freedom in their own country.\" Anthony C. Yu, a professor emeritus of Chinese, recalled speaking at a large gathering of CI teachers employed on American campuses, and finding most weren't trained language instructors and only a few were fluent in English. When George Washington University announced the establishment of a CI in 2013, a dean supported the program because the University of Chicago had also started one, but following the recent petition there, GW is changing the Faculty Code to protect academic freedom, particularly for professors studying Chinese policy, who could have cause to fear censorship by the Confucius Institute.\n\nOn 25 September 2014, the University of Chicago stated that they had suspended negotiations to renew its CI contract because \"recently published comments about UChicago in an article about the director-general of Hanban are incompatible with a continued equal partnership.\" This referred to Xu Lin's interview with the \"Jiefang Daily\", the official newspaper of the Communist Party in Shanghai. The article states that following the UChicago faculty petition, Xu Lin wrote a letter to Chicago's president and called the university representative in Beijing (where Chicago has a research center), \"with only one line: 'If your school decides to withdraw, I will agree to it.' Her attitude made the other side anxious. The school quickly responded that it will continue to properly manage the Confucius Institute.\" Hanban Vice Director Hu Zhiping responded to Chicago's decision with a written statement: \"Hanban thinks it’s a pity that the University of Chicago has made the public statement before finding out the truth. Since Confucius Institute is a collaboration program, both sides can make a choice.\" Dali Yang, the Chicago CI director, said the institute would continue to support existing projects after the current five-year agreement expired on 29 September.\n\nSeveral UChicago faculty members commented on the CI closure. Bruce Lincoln, Professor of the History of Religions at Chicago, summarized the lengthy negotiations; the university administrators \"accurately represented the institution's core values\" when they argued against having a CI on campus, while the Chinese officials were \"heavy-handed, condescending, and difficult.\" Marshall Sahlins, an emeritus professor who helped lead the fight against the CI, said the newspaper article \"fulsomely\" praised Xu Lin, and told \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"They knew that this was a dubious operation to begin with. They knew that there was a large opposition from an important segment of the faculty. And then, given that, the newspaper report simply triggered or changed the balance definitively.\"\n\nGary Rawnsley, a British expert on international communication, said that Xu Lin could not have picked a worse time \"to assert her imaginary authority\", and the \"Business Spectator\" concluded this hardline behavior highlights one of the biggest problems for Beijing's charm offensive. \"It still relies on officials like Xu, who still think and act like party ideologues who like to assert their authority and bully people into submission.\"\n\n\"The Economist\" called Xu Lin's statement \"a boastful challenge\" and said opponents of Confucius Institutes will claim this as a victory for academic freedom. \"The Diplomat\" said that the current CI program of 465 institutes is heavily weighted toward the West, with 97 located in the U.S. but only 95 institutes in all of Asia. However, if backlash in the West continues to grow, the number of CIs \"may plateau in the West while there remains immense potential for growth in other regions\", including Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America.\nThe official newspaper of the Communist party, the \"People's Daily\" responded to the University of Chicago's closure of its Confucius Institute.\n\nOn 1 October 2014, Pennsylvania State University confirmed that it would close its Confucius Institute on 13 December 2014 when the contract expires, with its dean saying through a written statement that several of the university's goals are \"not consistent with those of the Office of Chinese Languages Council International, known as the Hanban, which provides support to Confucius Institutes throughout the world.\"\n\nIn an interview, a former director of the Penn State Confucius Institute, Eric Hayot, said he suspected that the Confucius Institute may not have been providing enough of a return on its investment. \"I will say that in my experience as CI director one of the major frustrations with the relationship was that we consistently had more ambitious ideas for the ways CI funding could be used\", such as research projects proposed by Penn State professors on topics concerning the environment, science, and politics. He said the Hanban regularly rejected such proposals \"too far outside the official CI ambit (which they would tell us was mainly 'cultural'),\" \"A lot of what the Hanban wanted us to do didn’t make sense given our institution, faculty population, and student population,\" said Professor Hayot, who was not involved in the CI contract negotiations this summer. \"Had they been flexible, it would have helped Confucius Institute succeed here.\"\n\n\"The Telegraph\" said China's effort to project soft power \"has suffered another serious setback\", and the UChicago and Penn State closures represent a major blow to China's attempt at using the government-funded institutes to improve its image around the world.\n\nHenry Reichman, a vice president of the AAUP and chairman of the committee that issued a statement condemning Confucius Institutes, said, \"There is clearly a growing sense that these academic centers need to be looked at a little more carefully ... I suspect U Chicago and Penn State won't be the only ones to come to the conclusion that a relationship with these institutes is not really worth it.\"\n\nA \"Bloomberg News\" editorial mentioned the three CI closures within two weeks, and says, \"If the institutes are meant to be insidious vehicles of Chinese soft-power indoctrination, they're doing a terrible job. In fact, they appear to be causing more damage than good to China’s image abroad.\"\n\nOn 4 December 2014, the United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights and International Organizations held a hearing entitled \"Is Academic Freedom Threatened by China's Influence on U.S. Universities?\". Chairman Chris Smith said, \"U.S. colleges and universities should not be outsourcing academic control, faculty and student oversight or curriculum to a foreign government\", and called for a Government Accountability Office study into academic agreements between American universities and China. The testimony of Perry Link, a Chinese studies professor at UC Riverside, made three policy recommendations: American university administrators should adopt a policy of \"consciously staking out the broadest of fields\" in their programs with China, the U.S. government should fund Chinese-language programs in the U.S., and should withhold visas for CI instructors as long as China continues to withhold visas for American scholars on political grounds. On the day after the House hearing, PRC Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Hua Chunying responded, \"All Confucius Institutes in the U.S. are there because they were applied for by U.S. universities of their own will. We have assisted with supplying teachers and textbooks at the request of the U.S. side but have never interfered with academic freedom.\"\n\nIn 2008, Tel Aviv University officials shut down a student art exhibition depicting the \"oppression of Falun Gong\" in China. A Tel Aviv District Court judge subsequently ruled the university \"violated freedom of expression and succumbed to pressure from the Chinese Embassy.\" The judge noted the dean of students \"feared that the art exhibit would jeopardize Chinese support for its Confucius Institute and other educational activities.\"\n\nNew South Wales Greens MP John Kaye said that although teaching Chinese language and culture is important, \"Students are being denied a balanced curriculum which explores controversial issues, such as human rights violations and Taiwan, because critical examination might upset the Chinese government.\" Fellow Greens MP Jamie Parker organized a petition with more than 10,000 signatures, calling for removing the Confucius Classroom Program from local schools. NSW Minister for Education Adrian Piccoli defended the classes, and noted the Chinese language syllabuses did not include the study of political content. Shuangyuan Shi, director of Confucius Institute in Sydney, noted the institute primarily focuses on language, and teachers are not there to draw conclusions for students in regards to controversial subjects. Senior Department of Education officials acknowledge the institutes play an important role in fostering greater literacy in Asian languages, they admit to concerns about China's influence over the program's content. They say that the treatment of \"sensitive topics\" such as human rights is usually well handled by teachers. Furthermore, the staff at the Sydney institutes noted Beijing never threatened their academic freedom.\n\nAfter the University of Sydney's Institute for Democracy and Human Rights organized a 2013 talk by the Dalai Lama, the university warned that they could not use its logo, allow media coverage, or permit entry to the event by Tibet activists—forcing organizers to move the event off campus. University officials decided, \"there was a better way of doing it. A small group, a small section of the student body, was really not the best thing.\" Sarah Hanson-Young, an Australian Greens senator, said \"As a democratic country, we should be encouraging more open and frank discussion about the current situation in Tibet, not banning the country's spiritual leader from addressing students and staff at universities.\" A spokesperson for the activist Australia Tibet Council said the university had given in to China. \"They have compromised their academic freedom and integrity, and it also sends a disheartening message to the Tibetan people,\" more than 100 of whom have died in recent self-immolation protests. June Teufel Dreyer, a University of Miami (Florida) professor of political science, claims that Confucius Institutes have distorted history, citing universities in Australia inviting speakers \"to shill for the government and talk about how happy all the Tibetans were\". A Joint Conference of Australia's 13 Confucius Institutes was held in Sydney on 4 September 2014, intending to increase the CI network's \"visibility in Australia’s industry and public policy making communities\".\n\nIn December 2013, the Canadian Association of University Teachers passed a resolution calling on all Canadian universities and colleges that currently host CIs on their campuses to cease doing so, and those contemplating such arrangements to pursue them no further. This action followed upon the Université de Sherbrooke in Quebec closing its Confucius Institute, the University of Manitoba voting against hosting a CI out of concerns over political censorship, and McMaster University cancelling its CI contract following an instructor's human rights complaint. CAUT executive director James Turk said Canadian universities that agree to host CIs are compromising their own integrity by allowing the Hanban to have a voice in academic matters such as curriculum, texts, and topics of class discussion, describing such interference as a \"fundamental violation of academic freedom.\" Turk described CIs as \"essentially political arms of the Chinese government\", which restrict the free discussion of topics Chinese authorities deem controversial, and \"should have no place on our campuses.\"\n\nAt the 19 June 2014 meeting of the Toronto District School Board, Canada's largest school board, trustees voted to postpone the planned September startup of a Confucius Institute, in order to more closely examine a 2012 agreement that chair Chris Bolton unilaterally negotiated with the Hanban. On the morning of the meeting, Bolton suddenly resigned and was not available to answer questions. Many trustees complained that they had not received enough information about the partnership and were caught off guard when they received hundreds of emails and phone calls from parents protesting against CIs. An editorial in \"The Globe and Mail\" said Bolton \"showed a stunning lack of judgment\", and warned that \"the Confucius Institute functions as little more than a long arm of the Chinese state, pushing its political agenda under the guise of simple language instruction.\" \nThe deputy director-general of the Hunan Provincial Department of Education sent a letter to the TDSB that said, \"If the Confucius Institute in Toronto was suspended, there would be a great damage to the relationship between the two sides, which is hard for us to accept.\"\n\nOn 30 September 2014, the TDSB's Planning and Priorities Committee voted to terminate the Confucius Institute program, leaving the final decision to the full board meeting at the end of October. TDSB chair Mari Rutka declared she did not feel reassured that going forward would be a good move, and said, \"There have been too many concerns raised, I think, again, we have the examples of a number of other institutions that have decided not to go on with this.\" Trustees said they had heard both sides of the argument, and received pressure from both parents alarmed over China's control of the programs and from Chinese officials who warned them that dissolving the partnership would endanger the TDSB's most lucrative market for fee-paying international students. The CI issue has been contentious, involving a website and petitions. The committee heard from 10 speakers, half against the contract (including a former Canadian Security Intelligence Service Asia/Pacific chief who warned the institutes are a \"Trojan horse\"), and half in favor (a spokesperson from the Confederation of Chinese Canadian Organizations in Toronto who said the issue was not political but \"about culture and language\"). A newspaper editorial described CIs as state-supported, state-directed entities controlled by a \"one-party regime that recently evolved from Marxism-Leninism into what can be best described as a novel form of non-democratic elitism with kleptocratic tendencies.\"\n\nAt the 30 October 2014 full meeting, the TDSB voted 20-2 to cancel the CI contract. Trustee Pamela Gough said her concern was that \"the Confucius Institute is directly controlled by the Communist Party of China, and there is irrefutable evidence that the party exerts its influence through [the institute]\". In response to the TDSB rejection, an op-ed from the state-run \"China Daily\" called the criticisms \"unfair\" and accused CI critics of having \"a deep bias against China\". David Mulroney, a former Canadian ambassador to China, said, \"We're seeing really the end of the free ride that Confucius Institutes have had, particularly in North America\".\n\nIn December 2014, Stockholm University, the first university in Europe to host a Confucius Institute, announced it was terminating the program. Press coverage of the Braga incident in the Swedish press was said to have influenced the decision. \"Generally it is questionable to have, within the framework of the university, institutes that are financed by another country,\" said the university's chancellor. No major university in Sweden and Denmark now hosts a Confucius Institute.\n\nA censorship effort by the Confucius Institute's international director Xu Lin against Taiwan occurred in Portugal in July 2014. Upon her arrival on 23 July 2014, at a European Sinology conference partly organized by the director of the Confucius Institute at the University of Minho, Braga, Portugal, the international head of the Confucius Institutes, Xu Lin, ordered censorship of \"important pages\" that included references to Taiwan institutions, one of which, the Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation, was also funding the conference as it has for the past 20 years.\n\nOn the first day of the annual conference of the European Association for Chinese Studies (EACS), with several hundred attendees, Xu Lin ordered the programs seized. Four pages were torn out of the program before they were re-issued to conference attendees the next day.\n\nThe president of the EACS ordered 500 copies of the deleted pages to be distributed to attendees and issued a report on the incident. The U.S. online university site Inside Higher Ed quoted Marshall Sahlins, professor emeritus at the University of Chicago and a leading critic of the Confucius Institutes, who said that this incident illustrated the Confucius Institutes provision that programming they fund must abide by Chinese laws, including those restricting speech; \"Moreover they’re going to enforce them the way they do in China, which is not so much by going to court... but simply by fiat.\" Taiwan's cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council issued a reproach over the censorship incident, saying, \"The mainland should deal with Taiwan's participation in activities on international occasions pragmatically. If there is no respect for each other, the development of cross-strait relations will be seriously hurt.\"\n\n\"The Christian Science Monitor\" reported that the censorship has made more academics in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia grow uneasy with Confucius Institutes. Eamonn Fingleton suggests that perhaps the most embarrassing aspect of the whole Braga Incident is that Beijing has reversed itself on the \"hot-button issue at the center of the entire controversy. After vehemently denying for years that the Confucius Institutes have any kind of censorship agenda, Beijing has now tacitly acknowledged that this was false.\"\n\n\"The Parliament Magazine\" said of the Braga Incident that European higher education should remain independent and not be turned into \"an instrument of outright propaganda of the Chinese Communist party.\"\n\nIn December 2014, the BBC interviewed Xu Lin in Beijing. During the interview, BBC reporter John Sudworth asked about the Braga incident, but afterwards Xu Lin objected and insisted that large portions of the interview to be deleted. The BBC refused the Chinese censorship demand. One of the points she made in the interview is that Taiwan belongs to China, and therefore outsiders have no business interfering. \"Xu Lin not only refused to answer difficult questions, she also politicised the Confucius Institutes and reinforced the idea that they are led by dogmatists,\" commented Gary Rawnsley, professor of Public Diplomacy at Aberystwyth University, Wales. \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported on Xu's BBC interview, and said, \"Critics have argued that China’s Confucius Institutes pose a threat to academic freedom in the United States, Canada, Europe and beyond. Now the Beijing official in charge of them has confirmed it.\"\n\nOn 27 July 2015, a prosecutor filed a complaint to the city court in Blagoveshchensk Amur Oblast, Russia, asking that the court shut down the Blagoveschensk State Pedagogical University Confucius Institute on the grounds that it is violating Russian law by not being registered as a non-commercial organization, and thus, foreign teachers have no legal grounds to work at the institute. The prosecutor's statement said that instead of being a part of the university, the CI should be registered as a foreign cultural center.\n\nThe Confucius Classroom program partners with local secondary schools or school districts to provide teachers and instructional materials.\n\nCampaign groups raised concerns about Confucius Classrooms in the UK in 2015. Isabel Hilton, a broadcaster and writer whose own work was censored by the Confucius Institute, said: \"State control undertaking in China in the teaching of culture means contestation is not really allowed. If this is happening in our schools where people are not familiar with the Chinese buying their way into our education system, we ought to ask serious questions about whether that's a good thing.\" Campaigning group Free Tibet claimed that lessons are limited by \"terms effectively determined by a government that suppresses free speech inside its own borders and which is responsible for widespread human rights abuses.\" The group also raised concerns that money from the Chinese government had been accepted without \"proper, democratic scrutiny.\"\n\nIn one instance, the Hacienda La Puente Unified School District Board of Education encountered strong community opposition to establishing a Confucius Classroom at Cedarlane middle school in Hacienda Heights, which is \"a heavily Hispanic community with a majority-Chinese school board.\" A \"San Gabriel Valley Tribune\" editorial compared this CI program as \"tantamount of asking Hugo Chavez to send his cadres to teach little American kids economics.\" History teacher Jane Shults described criticisms of Confucius Classrooms as \"jingoistic, xenophobic, not overly rational and it’s really shades of McCarthyism.\" One member of the Hacienda La Puente school board, Norman Hsu, said it wasn’t worth pushing the issue, since, without California credentials, the teacher would not have been permitted to operate as a full-fledged instructor anyway. Another school board member, Jay Chen, characterized the Confucius Classroom scheme's opponents, \"What they all share in common, besides not having any children in the district (many don’t even live in the district), are steadfast accusations that the school board is trying to promote Communism in the classroom.\" Chen concluded that xenophobic \"Anti-Sinoism\" was causing the Hacienda La Puente disagreements. University of Southern California public diplomacy professor Nicholas J. Cull said, \"I’m sure this will become a standard dispute. People in America are very suspicious of ideas from the outside.\"\n\nThe Bibb County Public School District, which includes Macon, Georgia, mandated that Mandarin Chinese would become a required subject for every student, pre-K through 12th grade. Although the superintendent described the agreement for the Confucius Classroom to supply the Chinese language teachers as \"a win-win for everyone,\" some parents were critical. A few feared a \"Communist regime enacting its geopolitical agenda on their children\", but most had practical concerns, such as whether local students would benefit more from learning Spanish than Chinese as a foreign language.\n\nDavid Coleman (education) president of the College Board announced plans with Hanban to open Confucius Classrooms in 20 school districts across the U.S.\n\nIn 2011, the instructor hiring policies posted publicly on Hanban's website stated that candidates for teaching positions should be \"aged between 22 and 60, healthy, no record of participation in Falun Gong and other illegal organizations, and no criminal record\". Hanban representatives in North America defended the policy, stating that Confucius Institutes must follow Chinese law. The associate-director at the Confucius Institute at Pace University in New York likewise suggested that the Chinese government \"has a right\" to ban Falun Gong adherents from being volunteer teachers.\n\nIn 2012, \"The Globe and Mail\" reported that Sonia Zhao quit her teaching position at McMaster University's Confucius Institute in Hamilton, Ontario, and sought political asylum in Canada based on religious discrimination. In a complaint filed to the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario, Ms. Zhao stated she was forced to hide her belief in the Falun Gong spiritual movement, which the Chinese government calls an illegal \"evil cult\", and argued that McMaster \"is giving legitimization to discrimination.\" She told an interviewer that during her CI training in Beijing, she was told that if students asked about Tibet or other sensitive topics, \"Don’t talk about this. If the student insists, you just try to change the topic, or say something the Chinese Communist Party would prefer.\" Andrea Farquhar, McMaster's assistant vice-president of public and government affairs, said the university was \"looking for clarity\" from its Chinese partners on aspects of their agreement, notably hiring practices. Having lent its name to the Confucius Institute on its campus, Ms. Farquhar said McMaster was insisting that Canadian laws and expectations be respected. In 2013, McMaster University announced they would close their Confucius Institute. Andrea Farquhar explained that after months of making a concerted effort to save their 5-year partnership with Hanban, \"We were uncomfortable, and felt that it didn’t reflect the way the university would do hiring\", and explained that McMaster's Chinese partners replied with a letter expressing \"some disappointment.\" Ms. Zhao, a Chinese citizen, has since been granted refugee status in Canada.\n\nWhile many universities (such as the University of Pennsylvania and University of Manitoba) have refused Hanban offers to host Confucius Institutes, a few hosting universities have decided to terminate their 5-year renewable CI contracts: 1 Japanese university in 2010, 1 French and 2 Canadian in 2013, 1 Canadian, 1 Swedish, and 2 American universities in 2014, and one German university in 2015. Regarding the recent international closures of Confucius Institutes, a July 2015 article in \"The Diplomat\" said that although nations like Japan use soft power to promote positive images of themselves for the sake of political profit, China uses soft power for lies and censorship, but the world \"sees through its con\".\n\nOn 7 February 2013, Canada's McMaster University terminated its CI contract owing to an instructor's human rights complaint and the university's lack of control over hiring CI employees. The Hanban replied with a letter expressing \"some disappointment.\" In the previous year, Sonia Zhao, a Chinese national, quit her teaching position at McMaster's Confucius Institute and sought political asylum in Canada based on religious discrimination. Ms. Zhao filed a complaint with the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario, stating that McMaster was \"giving legitimization to discrimination\" because she was forced to hide her belief in the Falun Gong spiritual movement, for which the Hanban would fire her. The university insisted that the Confucius Institute respect Canadian laws and expectations on hiring and firing practices.\n\nOn 24 September 2013, France's University of Lyon closed their Confucius Institute at Lumière University Lyon 2 and Jean Moulin University Lyon 3, which had been established in 2009. Gregory B. Lee, board chair of the CI said its director was \"taking his instructions directly from Beijing\" and \"questioned the content of our courses.\"\n\nOn 31 December 2013, Canada's Université de Sherbrooke in Quebec closed their Confucius Institute after months of failed negotiations, saying that the Hanban arrangement no longer met the university's international plans. On 17 December 2013, the Canadian Association of University Teachers passed a resolution calling on all Canadian universities and colleges that currently host CIs on their campuses to cease doing so, and those contemplating such arrangements to pursue them no further. Of the six Canadian universities that sent replies to the CAUT, only the Université de Sherbrooke said it would be severing ties with the CI.\n\nMontreal's Dawson College, which partnered with Université de Sherbrooke in 2007 to establish the Confucius Institute in Quebec, decided to continue hosting. Agents from the Canadian Security Intelligence Service interviewed Meng Rong, director of the CI in Quebec, showed her a list of names, and asked if she could identify anyone. Meng told an interviewer that the CI had \"nothing to do with politics or spying\".\n\nOn 25 September 2014, the University of Chicago suspended lengthy negotiations to renew its Confucius Institute contract, citing director-general Xu Lin's boastful claims in the official Communist \"Jiefang Daily\" that she made the university fear cancelling with one sentence—\"If your school decides to withdraw, I will agree to it.\"\n\nOn 1 October 2014, Pennsylvania State University announced that it will discontinue hosting a Confucius Institute at the end of the year when their contract expires. The university spokesperson said their goals are not consistent with those of the Hanban, or Office of Chinese Languages Council International.\n\nOn 30 October 2014, the Toronto District School Board, which oversees public schools with 232,000 students, voted to cancel their CI contract. Trustee Pamela Gough said it was clear that \"this partnership is not aligned with TDSB and community values, and its continuation is not appropriate.\"\n\nOn 20 December 2014 Stockholm University, Sweden, announced that the Stockholm Confucius Institute will be closed by the end of June 2015. According to the vice-chancellor of Stockholm University the new contracts for the Confucius Institutes are not in line with how Swedish universities are governed.\n\nIn 2014, the Hanban signed a contract with the Stuttgart Media University and University of Hohenheim to open a CI in Stuttgart, Germany, but in June 2015, the universities abandoned the plan. A spokesperson blamed the decision on a failure to find the necessary support for the Confucius Institute, nonetheless, a Students for a Free Tibet press release said their \"Say No to Confucius Institutes\" campaign's opposition to the Stuttgart plan had been successful, and declared a victory for democratic values and academic freedom worldwide.\n\n"}
{"id": "54463849", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54463849", "title": "Cultural governance", "text": "Cultural governance\n\nCultural governance is governance of culture. It includes cultural policy made by governments but extends also to cultural influence exerted by non-state actors and to policies which influence culture indirectly.\n\nThe tendency to discuss cultural governance rather than policy corresponds to the broader shift from government to governance, with the emphasis shifting from state policymakers to include the influence of civil society organizations and the private sector. A broad interpretation of \"governance\" could also include government policies outside the scope of cultural policy which nevertheless impact culture.\n\nThe precise meaning of \"cultural governance\" also depends heavily on the definition of culture, which can range from narrow reference to institutions like museums and concert halls connected with the arts to broad meanings such as a society’s way of life or its systems of knowledge and symbols. In the broader view, cultural governance deals holistically with the production of meaning in a society, through aspects including the culture industry, the formation of taste, and the use of language.\n\nThe dominant actor in global cultural governance is UNESCO, a United Nations specialized agency created in 1946 and headquartered in Paris, France. UNESCO produces documents which local governments frequently use as guidelines and may incorporate into law. It has also promoted the development of networks such as the Global Alliance for Cultural Diversity to promote public/social/private partnership in the cultural area. In recent years the organization has emphasized the importance of cities (with non-profit organizations participating in local governance) as cultural actors with networks such as the International Coalition of Cities Against Racism and the Creative Cities Network.\n\nUNESCO itself relies upon partnerships with the private sector in selecting, developing, and promoting World Heritage Sites. Meetings for the selection of these sites attract several hundred attendees, including representatives of interested groups. \"World heritage\" issues gain prominence through promotion in the mass media with publications such as \"National Geographic\" and many others. All steps of the process promote the development of a metaculture capable of adjudicating global cultural issues and producing a global literary canon from a vantage point of universality.\n\nAgenda 21 for culture, administered by an international organization called United Cities and Local Governments, represents a vector for global governance conducted by its members at a local level. This concept endorses \"culture as a fourth pillar of sustainable development\", adding to the three pillars of sustainable development identified in Agenda 21: economy, society, and environment.\n\nCultural governance in the European Union includes a range of cultural policies geared toward promoting European culture.\n\nThe European Commission's 2007 communication \"on a European agenda for culture in a globalizing world\" describes interaction with culture through a various channels, including support for and consultation with cultural organizations, encouragement of artist mobility and intercultural communication, use of European culture in international relations, maintenance of EU copyright law, and promotion of European cultural goods and services. The European governments consider it necessary to promote and guide cultural development actively because of deficiencies in cultural outcomes of the free market. Further, intercultural communication and integration are considered intertwined with economic integration.\n\nIn the People's Republic of China a major goal of cultural governance is to reinforce the legitimacy of the government. Culture has long played a role in the governance of China, from the harmonious society promoted by Confucianism to the Cultural Revolution and other Chinese Communist Party strategies for transforming traditional society into industrialized communism. Present-day Chinese leaders have made significant references in speeches to a continual tradition of Chinese culture and its importance for nationalist and geopolitical purposes. Cultural governance is integrated with propaganda, censorship, music, and education. Within the Chinese Ministry of Culture, the State Administration of Cultural Heritage has stated that China's cultural heritage should be used to \"strengthen national unity and promote sustainable development of the natural culture\".\n\nLocalities in China have assumed much of the responsibility for identifying heritage sites, with the result that 300,000 such sites have been declared, many without state protection and support. Local governments have frequently turned to private companies to manage these sites and operate tourism businesses. Sites may also come under many overlapping authorities, as in the case of Mount Wutai, a national park and World Heritage Site, which is managed by eight government agencies and governed by 29 international, national, and local laws.\n\n"}

{"id": "221254", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=221254", "title": "Estoppel", "text": "Estoppel\n\nEstoppel is a judicial device in common law legal systems whereby a court may prevent, or \"estop\" a person from making assertions or from going back on his or her word; the person being sanctioned is \"estopped\". Estoppel may prevent someone from bringing a particular claim, particularly if a promise unsupported by consideration is being relied on by the other party. Legal doctrines of estoppel are based in both common law and equity. \n\nIt is also a concept in international law.\n\nThere are many different types of estoppel which can arise, but the common thread between them is that a person is restrained from asserting a particular position in law where it would be inequitable to do so. By way of illustration:\n\n\nEstoppel is an equitable doctrine. Accordingly, any person wishing to assert an estoppel must normally come to the court with \"clean hands\".\n\nThe doctrine of estoppel (which may prevent a party from asserting a right) is often confused with the doctrine of waiver (which relates to relinquishing a right once it has arisen). It also substantially overlaps with, but is distinct from, the equitable doctrine of laches.\n\nThe verb is \"estop\", which comes from Middle English \"estoppen\", itself borrowed from Old French \"estop(p)er\", \"estouper\", presumably from Vulgar Latin *\"stuppāre.\" 'to stop up with tow, caulk', from Latin \"stuppa\", 'broken flax', from Ancient Greek \"stuppe\", 'broken flax'. The noun form \"estoppel\" is based on the Old French \"estoupail,\" 'stopper, bung', a derivative of \"estouper\".\n\nWhere a court finds that a party has done something warranting a form of estoppel, that party is said to be estopped from making certain related arguments or claiming certain related rights. The defendant is estopped from presenting the related defence, or the plaintiff is estopped from making the related argument against the defendant. Lord Coke stated, \"It is called an estoppel or conclusion, because a man's own act or acceptance stoppeth or closeth up his mouth to allege or plead the truth.\"\n\nEstoppel is sometimes said to be a rule of evidence whereby a person is barred from leading evidence of a fact that has already been settled or they are otherwise precluded from asserting, but that may be an oversimplification. Firstly, although some estoppels relate to preventing a party from asserting \"facts\", others relate to preventing a party from asserting a \"right\" or a \"claim\". Secondly, under the conflict of laws in common law jurisdictions, matters of evidence are usually treated as procedural matters for the law of the local court (the \"lex fori\"), whereas it is generally accepted that an estoppel may affect substantive rights and are therefore matters to be determined by the proper law (or \"lex causae\") that governs the particular issue.\n\nThere are many different types of estoppel that can arise under common law legal systems. It has been judicially noted on more than one occasion that the link between them is often somewhat tenuous. \"Treitel on Contracts\" notes that \"unconscionability...provides the link between them\", but they nevertheless have \"separate requirements and different terrains of application\". The courts have long abandoned an attempt to create a single general underlying rationale or principle:\nThe plea of estoppel is often closely connected with the plea of waiver, the object of both being to ensure bona fides in day-to-day transactions. It is also related to the doctrines of variation and election. It is applied in many areas of contract law, including insurance, banking, and employment. In English law, the concept of legitimate expectation in the realm of administrative law and judicial review is estoppel's counterpart in public law.\n\nPromissory estoppel is often applied where there is an agreement without a consideration, or the consideration is future-based (as a promise). When applied in defense by a defendant it may be called a \"shield\", and where applied by a plaintiff it may be called a \"sword\". It is most commonly used as a shield, with some commentators stating that it can only be used as a shield, although this varies with jurisdictions.\n\nEstoppel can be understood by considering examples such as the following:\n\n\nSome types of estoppel under English, Australian, and American laws are as follows:\n\n\n\nReliance-based estoppels (at English law) include:\nBoth \"Halsbury's\" and Spencer Bower (see below) describe these three estoppels collectively as estoppels by representation. More simply, one party must say or do something and see the other party rely on what is said or done to change behavior.\n\nAll reliance-based estoppels require the victimised party to show both \"inducement\" and \"detrimental reliance\", i.e.:\n\nSimply put, promissory estoppel has four necessary elements which the plaintiff must prove:\n\nEstoppel by representation of fact and promissory estoppel are mutually exclusive: the former is based on a representation of existing fact (or of mixed fact and law), while the latter is based on a promise not to enforce some pre-existing right (i.e. it expresses an intention as to the future). A promissory estoppel operates only between parties who, at the time of the representation, were in an existing relationship, while this is not a requirement for estoppel by representation of fact.\n\nThe test for unconscionability in the English and Australian courts takes many factors into account, including the behavior, state of mind and circumstances of the parties. Generally, the following eight factors are determinative:\n\nBut in \"Cobbe v Yeoman's Row\", Lord Scott of Foscote stated the following:\n\nIn English law, estoppel by representation of fact is a term coined by Spencer Bower. This species of estoppel is also referred to as \"common law estoppel by representation\" in \"Halsbury's Laws of England\", vol 16(2), 2003 reissue.\n\nSpencer Bower defines estoppel by representation of fact as follows:\n\nA second definition comes from Sean Wilken and Theresa Villiers:\n\nA representation can be made by words or conduct. Although the representation must be clear and unambiguous, a representation can be inferred from silence where there is a duty to speak or from negligence where a duty of care has arisen. Under English law, estoppel by representation of fact usually acts as a defence, though it may act in support of a cause of action or counterclaim.\n\nUnder English and Australian legal systems, \"estoppels in equity\" include promissory and proprietary estoppels, described below. (Contrast with estoppel by representation, which is a claim (under the English system) at law.)\n\nIn English law, \"proprietary estoppel\" is distinct from promissory estoppel. \"Proprietary estoppel\" is not a concept in American law, but a similar result is often reached under the general doctrine of promissory estoppel.\n\nTraditionally, \"proprietary estoppel\" arose in relation to rights to use the land of the owner, and possibly in connection with disputed transfers of ownership. Although proprietary estoppel was only traditionally available in disputes affecting title to real property, it has now gained limited acceptance in other areas of law. Proprietary estoppel is closely related to the doctrine of constructive trust.\n\nJ. Fry summarized the five elements for proprietary estoppel as:\n\n\nExample: A father promised a house to his son who took possession and spent a large sum of money improving the property, but the father never actually transferred the house to the son. Upon the father's death, the son claimed to be the equitable owner. The court found the testamentary trustees (as representatives of the deceased father's estate) were \"estopped\" from denying the son's proprietary interest, and ordered them to convey the land to the son.\n\nThe doctrine of \"promissory estoppel\" prevents one party from withdrawing a promise made to a second party if the latter has reasonably relied on that promise.\n\nA promise made without consideration is generally not enforceable. It is known as a bare or gratuitous promise. Thus, if a car salesman promises a potential buyer not to sell a certain car over the weekend, but does so, the promise cannot be enforced. But should the car salesman accept from the potential buyer even one penny in consideration for the promise, the promise will be enforceable in court by the potential buyer. Estoppel extends the court's purview even to cases where there is no consideration, though it is generally not a 'sword': not a basis on which to initiate a lawsuit.\n\nThe doctrine of \"promissory estoppel\" was first developed in \"Hughes v. Metropolitan Railway Co\" [1877] but was lost for some time until it was resurrected by Denning J in the controversial case of \"Central London Property Trust Ltd v High Trees House Ltd\".\n\nPromissory estoppel requires:\n\nIn general, estoppel is \"a shield not a sword\"—it cannot be used as the basis of an action on its own. It also does not extinguish rights. In \"High Trees\" the plaintiff company was able to restore payment of full rent from early 1945, and could have restored the full rent at any time after the initial promise was made provided a suitable period of notice had been given. In this case, the estoppel was applied to a \"negative promise\", that is, one where a party promises not to enforce full rights.\n\nEstoppel is an equitable (as opposed to common law) construct and its application is therefore discretionary. In the case of \"D & C Builders v. Rees\" the courts refused to recognise a promise to accept a part payment of £300 on a debt of £482 on the basis that it was extracted by duress. In \"Combe v. Combe\" Denning elaborated on the equitable nature of estoppel by refusing to allow its use as a \"sword\" by an ex-wife to extract funds from the destitute husband.\n\nThe general rule is that when one party agrees to accept a lesser sum in full payment of a debt, the debtor has given no consideration, and so the creditor is still entitled to claim the debt in its entirety. This is not the case if the debtor offers payment at an earlier date than was previously agreed, because the benefit to the creditor of receiving payment early can be thought of as consideration for the promise to waive the rest of the debt. This is the rule formulated in \"Pinnel's Case\", and affirmed in \"Foakes v Beer\".\n\nThe decision of the Court of Appeal in \"Collier v P & MJ Wright (Holdings) Ltd\" suggests that the doctrine of promissory estoppel can now operate to mitigate the harshness of this common law rule. Moreover, Arden LJ held that allowing a creditor to renege on his promise to forebear seeking the balance of a debt in return for part payment would be, in and of itself, inequitable. Therefore, the only reliance that the promisee must demonstrate is the actual making of the part payment. This approach has been criticised as doing violence to the principle set down in Hughes and the extent to which the other members of the Court, namely Longmore LJ, agreed with it is uncertain.\n\nEquitable estoppel is the American counterpart to estoppel by representation. Its elements are summarized as:\n\nFor example, in \"Aspex Eyewear v. Clariti Eyewear\", eyeglass frame maker Aspex sued competitor Clariti for patent infringement. Aspex waited three years, without responding to a request that it list the infringed patent claims, before asserting its patent in litigation. During this period, Clariti expanded its marketing and sales of the products. The Federal Circuit found that Aspex misled Clariti to believe it would not enforce its patent, and thus estopped Aspex from proceeding with the suit.\n\nIn many jurisdictions of the United States, \"promissory estoppel\" is an alternative to consideration as a basis for enforcing a promise. It is also sometimes called \"detrimental reliance.\"\n\nThe American Law Institute in 1932 included the principle of estoppel into § 90 of the Restatement of Contracts, stating:\n\nHowever:\n\nSuppose that B goes to a store and sees a sign that the price of a radio is $10. B tells the shopkeeper that he will get the money and come back later that day to purchase it; there is no discussion of price. The shopkeeper says that when B returns, he will welcome B as a customer—unless he sells all three of his radios first. Hearing this, B goes and sells his watch for $10 (it was really worth $15, but since B wanted the money right away, he chose not to wait for the best price). When B returns, the sign says $11, and the owner tells B that he has raised the price. In equity, can you argue that the shopkeeper is estopped by conduct? B relied upon the implied representation that a radio would be sold for $10 when he returned with the money; B has sold his watch at a discount, to his detriment. (This element would be absent if B sold the watch at the market price.) But the shopkeeper did not guarantee to hold one of the radios against the possibility of B's return nor did they agree a fixed price.\n\nIn some common-law jurisdictions, a promise by the shopkeeper to hold a specific radio would create a binding contract, even if B had to go for the money. A \"promise\" to pay the owner in the future is good consideration if it is made in exchange for a promise to sell a specific radio (one from three is probably sufficiently specific): one promise in exchange for a second promise creates equal value. So the shopkeeper's actual words and knowledge are critical to deciding whether either a contract or an estoppel arises.\n\nThe drafters of the Second Restatement debated how to calculate the amount of damages flowing from a promissory estoppel, using the following example: A young man's uncle promises to give him $1,000 to buy a car. The young man buys a car for $500, but the uncle refuses to pay any money. Is the young man entitled to $1,000 (the amount promised), or merely $500 (the amount he actually lost)? The Restatement states that \"The remedy granted for breach may be limited as justice requires.\"—leaving quantification to the discretion of the court. In practice, however, a recent study of over 300 promissory estoppel cases decided under the Restatement (Second) of Contracts has found that many courts continue to enforce the promise to the full extent (i.e., $1,000 in the example above).\n\n\"Estoppel in pais\" (literally \"by act of notoriety\", or \"solemn formal act\") is the historical root of common law estoppel by representation and equitable estoppel. The terms \"Estoppel in pais\" and equitable estoppel are used interchangeably in American law.\n\n\"Estoppel by convention\" in English law (also known as \"estoppel by agreement\") occurs where two parties negotiate or operate a contract but make a mistake. If they share an assumption, belief, or understanding of the contract's interpretation or legal effect, then they are bound by it, if:\n\n\nEstoppel by convention is most commonly invoked if one party wishes to rely on pre-contract negotiation as an aid to construction of the contract.\n\nIt is debatable whether \"estoppel by convention\" is a separate estoppel doctrine, or merely a case of \"reliance-based estoppel\" (\"estoppel by representation\" would be its most frequent form), or of the rule of interpretation that, where words in a contract are ambiguous, one always interprets those words so as to give effect to the actual intentions of the parties even if that would not be the usual legal outcome (see \"Amalgamated Investment and Property Co. Ltd. v Texas Commerce International Bank Ltd\" [1982] QB 84).\n\n\"Estoppel by acquiescence\" may arise when one person gives a legal warning to another based on some clearly asserted facts or legal principle, and the other does not respond within \"a reasonable period of time\". By \"acquiescing\", the other person is generally considered to have lost the legal right to assert the contrary.\n\nAs an example, suppose that Jill has been storing her car on Jack's land with no contract between them. Jack sends a registered letter to Jill's legal address, stating: \"I am no longer willing to allow your car to stay here for free. Please come get your car, or make arrangements to pay me rent for storing it. If you do not do so, within 30 days, I will consider the car abandoned and will claim ownership of it. If you need more time to make arrangements, please contact me within 30 days, and we can work something out.\" If Jill does not respond, she may be said to have \"relinquished\" her ownership of the car, and \"estoppel by acquiescence\" may prevent any court from invalidating Jack's actions of registering the car in his name and using it as his own.\n\nThe law relating to contractual estoppel (in English law) was summarised in :\n\n\"Estoppel by deed\" is a rule of evidence arising from the status of a contract signed under seal—such agreements, called deeds, are more strictly enforced than ordinary contracts and the parties are expected to take greater care to verify the contents before signing them. Hence, once signed, all statements of fact (usually found in the opening recital which sets out the reason(s) for making the deed) are conclusive evidence against the parties who are estopped from asserting otherwise.\n\n\"[O]ne who by his speech or conduct has induced another to act in a particular manner ought not be permitted to adopt an inconsistent position, attitude or course of conduct may not be adopted to loss or injury of another\". For example, as between two or more claimants, a party that takes multiple and inconsistent legal positions is estopped to assert its positions against another consistent and certain claim, i.e. preferential treatment for certain over uncertain claims.\n\nIssue estoppel (more commonly known as issue preclusion) prevents, in some cases, an issue that has already been litigated and decided on the merits from being re-litigated, even when the parties are different. In the world of crime, some cases have achieved notoriety, e.g. in the Birmingham Six saga, the House of Lords ruled in \"Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police (1982)\" that \"issue estoppel\" applied. Lord Diplock said:\n\nA variant of issue estoppel also precludes a party from bringing a claim in subsequent proceedings which ought properly to have been brought as part of earlier legal proceedings.\n\nThe doctrine of promissory estoppel was adopted into Australian law in \"Legione v Hateley\". However, the plaintiffs were unsuccessful in that case because the reliance was unreasonable and the promise not unequivocal.\n\nAustralian law has now gone beyond the position espoused in the English \"High Trees\" case, to cases where there is no pre-existing legal relationship between the two parties, and promissory estoppel can be wielded as a \"sword\", not just as a \"shield\". Mason CJ and Wilson J in \"Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher\" held that if estoppel is proven, it gives rise to an equity in favour of the plaintiff, and the court will do the minimum equity that is just in the circumstances. From this case, it is also possible for the promise to come from silence or inaction.\n\nStated by Brennan J in \"Waltons Stores\": \n\nAlthough there is some debate as to whether \"unconscionability\" is an element that English courts need to take into account when considering estoppel by representation of fact, the Australian courts clearly do. This element is satisfied if one party encourages the other party to create assumptions that lead to reliance.\n\nToday, the principle of estoppel may give birth to an enforceable obligation even without a consideration under the following conditions:\n\nWhen enforcing an estoppel, Australian courts will look to the impact that enforcement will have on others, especially third parties. Relief in estoppel thus remains discretionary, and will not always be granted based on the expectation of the plaintiff.\n\nThe status of estoppel by representation of fact is less clear in Australia. Two seminal decisions purport to fuse common law and equitable estoppels into a single unified doctrine, but the New South Wales Court of Appeal continues to treat estoppel by representation at common law as distinct from equitable estoppel. This can be significant in deciding which court has jurisdiction to adjudicate on the issue.\n\nWhilst there also exists a doctrine of proprietary estoppel, the High Court of Australia merged this doctrine with the doctrine of promissory estoppel by virtue of their similar criteria.\n\nNonetheless, authority for the doctrine of proprietary estoppel indicates that if a landlord allows a licensee to expend money on the land under an expectation created or encouraged by the landlord that he/she will be able to remain there, and the licensee suffers a detriment in relying on that expectation, an equity arises in the licensee such as to entitle him/her to stay. Where a proprietary estoppel is found to exist, the court does not have to grant the plaintiff a proprietary interest in the land subject to the dispute. It may instead make an order that the plaintiff receive equitable compensation.\n\nSection 115 of the Indian Evidence Act defines estoppel: \"When one person has, by his declaration, act or omission, intentionally caused or permitted another person to believe a thing to be true and to act upon such belief, neither he nor his representative shall be allowed, in any suit or proceeding between himself and such person or his representative, to deny the truth of that thing.\"\n\nSo, for instance, if A intentionally and falsely leads B to believe that certain land belongs to A, and thereby induces B to buy and pay for it, and only later does A acquire the land, then A is not allowed to argue to void the sale on the ground that, at the time of the sale, he had no title.\n\nThe doctrine of estoppel is based on the principle that consistency in word and action imparts certainty and honesty to human affairs. If a person makes a representation to another, on the faith of which the latter acts, to his prejudice, the former cannot recant the representation.\n\nHowever, estoppel has no application to representations made regarding the fundamental rights conferred by the Constitution of India, the source of all laws, which exists not only to benefit individuals but to secure collective rights. Thus, no one can barter away the freedoms conferred upon him by the Constitution. A concession made by him in a proceeding, whether under a mistake of law or otherwise, that he does not possess or will not enforce any particular fundamental right, cannot estop him, as enforcing estoppel would defeat the purpose of the Constitution.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29517485", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29517485", "title": "Fin 48", "text": "Fin 48\n\nFIN 48 (mostly codified at ASC 740-10) is an official interpretation of United States accounting rules that requires businesses to analyze and disclose income tax risks. It was effective in 2007 for publicly traded entities, and is now effective for all entities adhering to US GAAP. A business may recognize an income tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained. The amount of benefit recognized is based on relative probable outcomes.\n\nIncome for financial statements may differ from taxable income for many valid reasons. U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles have long required that income tax be accrued for all events recognized for financial reporting purposes. The tax must be accrued if the liability is probable of assertion and can be determined with reasonable accuracy. The tax must be recognized on all worldwide income of the business that may eventually be taxed. Credits expected to be claimed may reduce this tax. Certain limited exceptions apply. Thus, the total income tax of a U.S. company is generally the U.S. Federal income tax rate times book income, plus state and foreign taxes, less credits to be claimed presently or in the future. This tax expense is recorded as a combination of taxes currently payable and deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n\nIn 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 on the above rules. Under FIN 48, businesses must analyze all tax positions that are less than certain. Only those positions that are more likely than not to produce benefit can be recognized in accruing tax. This is known as the recognition step. The likely outcomes of recognized positions are then computed and assigned probabilities. The most favorable set of outcomes that achieves 50% probability is then recognized. This is known as the measurement step. The business must then record tax expense or benefit, liabilities, and assets, as so measured.\n\nTax positions requiring analysis include all aspects of tax returns, including whether tax returns are filed in a jurisdiction. Further, businesses must accrue and disclose the effect of interest and penalties as part of the FIN 48 analysis.\n\nIncome tax expense, just as any other expense, must be generally recognized when income is earned. Credits or other items that reduce this tax are recognized only if it is more likely than not that the reductions will be sustained by tax authorities. FIN 48 clarifies several aspects of this process:\n\nThe level of detail of the analysis (unit of account) depends on how the business keeps its records, presents its financial statements, and deals with tax authorities. This may vary from business to business, and may change over time. Further, materiality is determined at the unit of account level.\n\nOne key clarification is the presumption of examination of all positions by knowledgeable tax authorities and a resolution of disputes over those positions solely on the technical merits of each position. All relevant tax law is to be considered for the individual position. Positions that are not technically correct are allowed only where there is widely understood administrative practice allowing the position. Thus, for example, a position would not be acceptable merely because an Internal Revenue Service agent allowed it in a previous year.\n\nIf it is more likely than not that a position will be sustained, then the effect of the position must be measured. Measurement is a three-step process:\n\nFor example, assume a position exists which is more likely than not to be sustained at least in part. Management determines that it is 25% likely that $100 of benefit will be sustained, and 30% likely that $75 of benefit will be sustained. The business must accrue only $75 of benefit.\n\nPositions that are highly certain of full recognition may require very limited analysis.\n\nIn addition to accruing the tax, FIN 48 requires disclosures in footnotes to the financial statements.

Despite the sizable capital investment, frequent union labor problems and work injuries and declining demand for the V8 engine blocks produced there led to the facility's closure in 1981.\n\nA worker, Robert Williams, was killed by an industrial robot arm on January 25, 1979. He is the first known human to be killed by a robot.\n\nMazda Motor Corporation started construction of a new building on the site of the Michigan Casting Center in 1985 and cars started production at Mazda Motor Manufacturing USA in September 1987 with the Mazda MX-6 and Ford Probe coupes. In 1991 the plant had 3,600 employees, including 250 Japanese employees.\n\nFord repurchased a 50% share in the plant on April 15, 1992, and it officially became a joint-venture and was renamed AutoAlliance International on July 1, 1992. The plant began production of all models of the Mazda 626 sold in America starting in 1993. During this era, Deepak Ahuja was Chief Financial Officer of the joint venture. The Ford Contour-derived Mercury Cougar was produced at the plant from 1998 to 2002. Production of North American Mazda 6 began in the 2003 model year, followed by the Ford Mustang starting in 2005.\n\nThe last Mazda 6 rolled off the line on Friday, August 24, 2012, with Mazda discontinuing production on American soil, effectively ending the 20 year joint-venture between Mazda and Ford. Mazda moved production of the Mazda 6 back to the Hofu factory in Japan and opened a new factory in Salamanca, Mexico to build the Mazda 2 and Mazda 3 subcompact and compact cars.\n\nOn September 10, 2012, Ford Motor Company re-took full management control of the plant, renaming it the Ford Flat Rock Assembly Plant, and confirming $555 million in investments designed to retool the plant for the production of the 2013 Ford Fusion midsize sedan.\n\nOn July 15, 2015, Ford confirmed that the new 2017 Lincoln Continental sedan would be produced at the Flat Rock plant starting in 2016.\n\nOn January 3, 2017, Ford announced that it will begin manufacturing an electric small SUV by 2020, and a high passenger volume autonomous vehicle designed for commercial ride hailing or ride sharing by 2021, both to be built at Flat Rock.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11616", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11616", "title": "Franchising", "text": "Franchising\n\nFranchising is based on a marketing concept which can be adopted by an organization as a strategy for business expansion. Where implemented, a franchiser licenses its know-how, procedures, intellectual property, use of its business model, brand, and rights to sell its branded products and services to a franchisee. In return the franchisee pays certain fees and agrees to comply with certain obligations, typically set out in a Franchise Agreement.\n\nThe word \"franchise\" is of Anglo-French derivation—from \"franc\", meaning free—and is used both as a noun and as a (transitive) verb.\nFor the franchiser, use of a franchise system is an alternative business growth strategy, compared to expansion through corporate owned outlets or \"chain stores\". Adopting a franchise system business growth strategy for the sale and distribution of goods and services minimizes the franchiser's capital investment and liability risk.\n\nAs with any business venture, franchising is not immune to risk. But if undertaken in the right way, franchising can be a vehicle of success for both the franchisor and franchisee.\n\nThirty-three countries have laws that explicitly regulate franchising, with the majority of all other countries having laws which have a direct or indirect effect on franchising.\nFranchising is also used as a foreign market entry mode.\n\nThe boom in franchising did not take place until after World War II. Nevertheless, the rudiments of modern franchising date back to the Middle Ages when landowners made franchise-like agreements with tax collectors, who retained a percentage of the money they collected and turned the rest over. The practice ended around 1562 but spread to other endeavors. For example, in 17th century England franchisees were granted the right to sponsor markets and fairs or operate ferries. There was little growth in franchising, though, until the mid-19th century, when it appeared in the United States for the first time.\n\nOne of the first successful American franchising operations was started by an enterprising druggist named John S. Pemberton. In 1886, he concocted a beverage comprising sugar, molasses, spices, and cocaine. Pemberton licensed selected people to bottle and sell the drink, which was an early version of what is now known as Coca-Cola. His was one of the earliest—and most successful—franchising operations in the United States.\n\nThe Singer Company implemented a franchising plan in the 1850s to distribute its sewing machines. The operation failed, though, because the company did not earn much money even though the machines sold well. The dealers, who had exclusive rights to their territories, absorbed most of the profits because of deep discounts. Some failed to push Singer products, so competitors were able to outsell the company. Under the existing contract, Singer could neither withdraw rights granted to franchisees nor send in its own salaried representatives. So, the company started repurchasing the rights it had sold. The experiment proved to be a failure. That may have been one of the first times a franchisor failed, but it was by no means the last. (Even Colonel Sanders did not initially succeed in his Kentucky Fried Chicken franchising efforts.) Still, the Singer venture did not put an end to franchising.\n\nOther companies tried franchising in one form or another after the Singer experience. For example, several decades later, General Motors Corporation established a somewhat successful franchising operation in order to raise capital. Perhaps the father of modern franchising, though, is Louis K. Liggett. In 1902, Liggett invited a group of druggists to join a \"drug cooperative.\" As he explained to them, they could increase profits by paying less for their purchases, especially if they set up their own manufacturing company. His idea was to market private label products. About 40 druggists pooled $4,000 of their own money and adopted the name \"Rexall\". Sales soared, and Rexall became a franchisor. The chain's success set a pattern for other franchisors to follow.\n\nAlthough many business owners did affiliate with cooperative ventures of one type or another, there was little growth in franchising until the early 20th century, and what franchising there was did not take the same form as it does today. As the United States shifted from an agricultural to an industrial economy, manufacturers licensed individuals to sell automobiles, trucks, gasoline, beverages, and a variety of other products. The franchisees did little more than sell the products, though. The sharing of responsibility associated with contemporary franchising arrangement did not exist to any great extent. Consequently, franchising was not a growth industry in the United States.\n\nIt was not until the 1960s and 1970s that people began to take a close look at the attractiveness of franchising. The concept intrigued people with entrepreneurial spirit. However, there were serious pitfalls for investors, which almost ended the practice before it became truly popular.\n\nThe following U.S. listing tabulates the early 2010 ranking of major franchises along with the number of sub-franchisees (or partners) from data available for 2004. The United States is a leader in franchising, a position it has held since the 1930s when it used the approach for fast-food restaurants, food inns and, slightly later, motels at the time of the Great Depression. As of 2005, there were 909,253 established franchised businesses, generating $880.9 billion of output and accounting for 8.1 percent of all private, non-farm jobs. This amounts to 11 million jobs, and 4.4 percent of all private sector output.\n\nMid-sized franchises like restaurants, gasoline stations and trucking stations involve substantial investment and require all the attention of a businessperson.\n\nThere are also large franchises like hotels, spas and hospitals, which are discussed further under technological alliances.\n\nThree important payments are made to a franchisor: (a) a royalty for the trademark, (b) reimbursement for the training and advisory services given to the franchisee, and (c) a percentage of the individual business unit's sales. These three fees may be combined in a single 'management' fee. A fee for \"disclosure\" is separate and is always a \"front-end fee\".\n\nA franchise usually lasts for a fixed time period (broken down into shorter periods, which each require renewal), and serves a specific territory or geographical area surrounding its location. One franchisee may manage several such locations. Agreements typically last from five to thirty years, with premature cancellations or terminations of most contracts bearing serious consequences for franchisees. A franchise is merely a temporary business investment involving renting or leasing an opportunity, not the purchase of a business for the purpose of ownership. It is classified as a wasting asset due to the finite term of the license.\n\nFranchise fees are on average 6.7% with an additional average marketing fee of 2% However, not all franchise opportunities are the same and many franchise organizations are pioneering new models that challenge antiquated structures and redefine success for the organization as well as the franchisee.\n\nA franchise can be exclusive, non-exclusive or \"sole and exclusive\".\n\nAlthough franchisor revenues and profit may be listed in a franchise disclosure document (FDD), no laws require an estimate of franchisee profitability, which depends on how intensively the franchisee \"works\" the franchise. Therefore, franchisor fees are typically based on \"gross revenue from sales\" and not on profits realized. See remuneration.\n\nVarious tangibles and intangibles such as national or international advertising, training and other support services are commonly made available by the franchisor.\n\nFranchise brokers help franchisors find appropriate franchisees. There are also main 'master franchisors' who obtain the rights to sub-franchise in a territory.\n\nAccording to the International Franchise Association approximately 44% of all businesses in the United States are franchisee-worked.\n\nFranchising is one of the few means available to access venture capital without the need to give up control of the operation of the chain and build a distribution system for servicing it. After the brand and formula are carefully designed and properly executed, franchisors are able to sell franchises and expand rapidly across countries and continents using the capital and resources of their franchisees while reducing their own risk.\n\nThere is also risk for the people buying the franchises. However, failure rates are much lower for franchise businesses than independent business startups.\n\nFranchisor rules imposed by the franchising authority are becoming increasingly strict. Some franchisors are using minor rule violations to terminate contracts and seize the franchise without any reimbursement.\n\nFranchising brings with it several advantages and disadvantages for firms looking to expand into new areas and foreign markets. The primary advantage is that the firm does not have to bear the development cost and risks of opening a foreign market on its own, as the Franchisee is typically responsible for those costs and risks, putting the onus on the Franchisee to build a profitable operation as quickly as possible. Through franchising a firm has the potential of building a global presence quickly and also at a low cost and risk.\n\nA primary disadvantage to franchising is quality control, as the franchisor wants the firm's brand name to convey a message to consumers about the quality and consistency of the firm's product. They want the consumer to experience the same quality regardless of location or franchise status. This can prove to be an issue with franchising, as a customer who had a bad experience at one franchise may assume that they will have the same experience at other locations with other services. Distance can make it difficult for firms to detect whether or not the franchises are of poor quality. One way around this disadvantage is to set up extra subsidiaries in each country or state in which the firm expands. This creates a smaller number of franchisees to oversee, which will reduce the quality control challenges.\n\nEach party to a franchise has several interests to protect. The franchisor is involved in securing protection for the trademark, controlling the business concept and securing know-how. The franchisee is obligated to carry out the services for which the trademark has been made prominent or famous. There is a great deal of standardization required. The place of service has to bear the franchisor's signs, logos and trademark in a prominent place. The uniforms worn by the staff of the franchisee have to be of a particular design and color. The service has to be in accordance with the pattern followed by the franchisor in the successful franchise operations. Thus, franchisees are not in full control of the business, as they would be in retailing.\n\nA service can be successful if equipment and supplies are purchased at a fair price from the franchisor or sources recommended by the franchisor. A coffee brew, for example, can be readily identified by the trademark if its raw materials come from a particular supplier. If the franchisor requires purchase from her stores, it may come under anti-trust legislation or equivalent laws of other countries. So too the purchase things like uniforms of personnel and signs, as well as the franchise sites, if they are owned or controlled by the franchisor.\n\nThe franchisee must carefully negotiate the license and must develop a marketing or business plan with the franchisor. The fees must be fully disclosed and there should not be any hidden fees. The start-up costs and working capital must be known before the license is granted. There must be assurance that additional licensees will not crowd the \"territory\" if the franchise is worked according to plan. The franchisee must be seen as an independent merchant. It must be protected by the franchisor from any trademark infringement by third parties. A franchise attorney is required to assist the franchisee during negotiations.\n\nOften the training period – the costs of which are in great part covered by the initial fee – is too short in cases where it is necessary to operate complicated equipment, and the franchisee has to learn on their own from instruction manuals. The training period must be adequate, but in low-cost franchises it may be considered expensive. Many franchisors have set up corporate universities to train staff online. This is in addition to providing literature, sales documents and email access.\n\nAlso, franchise agreements carry no guarantees or warranties and the franchisee has little or no recourse to legal intervention in the event of a dispute. Franchise contracts tend to be unilateral and favor of the franchisor, who is generally protected from lawsuits from their franchisees because of the non-negotiable contracts that franchisees are required to acknowledge, in effect, that they are buying the franchise knowing that there is risk, and that they have not been promised success or profits by the franchisor. Contracts are renewable at the sole option of the franchisor. Most franchisors require franchisees to sign agreements that mandate where and under what law any dispute would be litigated.\n\nIn 2016 there was an estimated 1,120 franchise brands operating in Australia and an estimated 79,000 units operating in business format franchises, with a total brand turnover of approximately $146 billion and a sales revenue of approximately $66.5 billion. In 2016 the majority of franchise brands were retailers with the largest segment being non-food retailing, accounting for 26 percent of brands, a further 19 percent of brands were involved in food retailing, 15 percent of franchisors operated in administration and support services, 10 percent in other services, 7 percent in education and training and 7 percent in rental, hire and real estate services. \n\nFranchising in Australia commenced in a significant way in the early 1970s under the influence of the franchised US fast food systems such as KFC, Pizza Hut, and McDonald's. It was however underway prior to this and a decade earlier in 1960 Leslie Joseph Hooker, considered a pioneer of franchising, created Australia’s first national real estate agency network of Hooker real estate agencies.\n\nIn Australia, franchising is regulated by the Franchising Code of Conduct, a mandatory code of conduct concluded under the Trade Practices Act 1974.\nThe ACCC regulates the Franchising Code of Conduct, which is a mandatory industry code that applies to the parties to a franchise agreement.\nThis code requires franchisors to produce a disclosure document which must be given to a prospective franchisee at least 14 days before the franchise agreement is entered into.\n\nThe code also regulates the content of franchise agreements, for example in relation to marketing funds, a cooling-off period, termination, and the resolution of disputes by mediation.\n\nOn 1 January 2015, the old Franchising Code was repealed and replaced with a new Franchising Code of Conduct. The new Code applies to conduct on or after 1 January 2015.\n\nThe new Code:\n\nThese are significant changes and it is important that franchisors, franchisees and potential franchises understand their rights and responsibilities under the Code.\n\nFor further information about the changes to the Code, please see the updated Franchisor Compliance Manual and the Franchisee Manual.\n\nThe Code explanatory materials are available from the ComLaw website (link is external).\n\nNew Zealand is served by around 423 franchise systems operating 450 brands, giving it the highest proportion of franchises per capita in the world. Despite (or because of) the 2008-09 recession, the total number of franchised units increased by 5.3% from 2009 to 2010. There is no separate law covering franchises, so they are covered by normal commercial law. This functions very well in New Zealand and includes law as it applies to contracts, restrictive trade practices, intellectual property, and the law of misleading or deceptive conduct.\n\nThe Franchise Association of New Zealand introduced a self-regulatory code of practice for its members in 1996. This contains many provisions similar to those of the Australian Franchising Code of Practice legislation, although only around a third of all franchises are members of the association and therefore bound by the code.\n\nA case of fraud in 2007 perpetrated by a former master franchisee of the country's largest franchise system led to a review of the need for franchise law by the Ministry of Economic Development. The New Zealand Government decided there was no case for franchise-specific legislation at that time. This decision was criticised by the opposition, which had initiated the review when in power, and the review process was questioned by a leading academic. The Franchise Association originally supported the positive regulation of the franchise sector but its eventual submission to the review was in favour of the status quo – self-regulation.\n\nBy the end of 2012, there were about 2,031 franchise brands operating in Brazil, with approximately 93,000 locations, making it one of the largest countries in the world in terms of number of units. Around 11 percent of this total were foreign-based franchisors.\n\nThe Brazilian Franchise Law (Law No. 8955 of December 15, 1994) defines the franchise as a system in which the franchisor licenses the franchisee, for a payment, the right to use a trademark or patent along with the right to distribute products or services on an exclusive or semi-exclusive basis.\nThe provision of a \"Franchise Offer Circular\", or disclosure document, is mandatory before execution of agreement and is valid for all of the Brazilian territory. Failure to disclose voids the agreement, which leads to refunds and serious payments for damages. The Franchise Law does not distinguish between Brazilian and foreign franchisors. The National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI) is the registering authority. Indispensable documents are a Statement of Delivery (of disclosure documentation) and a Certification of Recording (INPI). The latter is necessary for payments. All sums may not be convertible into foreign currency. Certification may also mean compliance with Brazil's antitrust legislation.\n\nParties to international franchising may decide to adopt the English language for the document, as long as the Brazilian party knows English fluently and expressly acknowledges that fact, to avoid translation. The registration accomplishes three things:\n\nIn Canada, recent legislation mandate better disclosure and fair treatment of franchisees. The regulations also ensure their right to form associations and launch collective action, even if they signed contracts prohibiting such moves. Franchising in Canada involves 1,300 brands, 80,000 franchise units accounting for about 20% of all consumer spending.\n\nChina has the most franchises in the world but the scale of their operations is relatively small. Each system in China has an average of 43 outlets, compared to more than 540 in the United States. Together, there are 2600 brands in some 200,000 retail markets. KFC was the most significant foreign entry in 1987 and is widespread Many franchises are in fact joint-ventures, as at their forming the franchise law was not explicit. For example, McDonald's is a joint venture. Pizza Hut, TGIF, Wal-mart, Starbucks followed a little later. But total franchising is only 3% of retail trade, which seeks foreign franchise growth.\n\nThe year 2005 saw the birth of an updated franchise law, \"Measures for the Administration of Commercial Franchise\". Previous legislation (1997) made no specific inclusion of foreign investors. Today the franchise law is much clearer by virtue of the 2007 law, a revision of the 2005 law.\n\nThe laws are applicable if there are transactions involving a trademark combined with payments with many obligations on the franchisor. The law comprises 42 articles and eight chapters.\n\nAmong the franchisor obligations are:\n\nThe franchisor must meet a list of requirements for registration, among which are:\n\nAmong other provisions:\n\nThe disclosure must take place 20 days in advance. It has to contain:\n\nOther elements of this legislation are:\n\nThe franchising of foreign goods and services to India is in its infancy. The first International Exhibition was only held in 2009. India is, however, one of the biggest franchising markets because of its large middle-class of 300 million who are not reticent about spending and because the population is entrepreneurial in character. In a highly diversified society, (see Demographics of India) McDonald's is a success story despite its fare's differing from that of the rest of the world.\n\nSo far, franchise agreements are covered under two standard commercial laws: the Contract Act 1872 and the Specific Relief Act 1963, which provide for both specific enforcement of covenants in a contract and remedies in the form of damages for breach of contract.\n\nIn Kazakhstan franchise turnover for 2013 is 2.5 billion US$ dollars per year. Kazakhstan is the leader in Central Asia in the franchising market. There is a special law on franchising which went into effect in 2002. There are more than 300 franchise systems and the number of franchised outlets approaches 2000. Kazakhstan franchising began with the emergence of a \"Coca-Cola\" factory, opened to sublicense a Turkish licensor of the same brand. The plant was built in 1994. Other brands that are also present in Kazakhstan through the franchise system include Pepsi, Hilton, Marriott, Intercontinental, and Pizza Hut.\n\nFranchising has grown rapidly in Europe in recent years, but the industry is largely unregulated. Unlike the United States, the European Union has not adopted a uniform franchise law. Only six of the 28 member states have a pre-contractual disclosure law. They are France (1989), Spain (1996), Romania (1997), Italy (2004) Sweden ( 2004) and Belgium (2005). Estonia and Lithuania have franchise laws that impose mandatory terms on franchise agreements. In Spain there is also mandatory registration on a public registry. Although they have no franchise specific laws, Germany and those countries with a legal system based upon that of Germany, such as Austria, Greece and Portugal, probably impose the greatest regulatory burden on franchisors due to their tendency to treat franchisees as quasi consumers in certain circumstances and the willingness of the judiciary to use the concept of good faith to make pro-franchisee decisions. In the UK, the recent Papa John case shows that there is also a need for pre-contractual disclosure and the Yam Seng case shows that there is a duty of good faith in franchise relationships.\n\nThe European Franchising Federation's Code of Ethics has been adopted by seventeen national franchise associations. However this has no legal force and enforcement by the national associations is neither uniform of rigorous. Commentators like Dr Mark Abell, in his book \"The Law and Regulation of Franchising in the EU\" ( Published in 2013 by Edward Elgar ) consider this lack of uniformity to be one of the greatest barriers to the franchising realising its potential in the EU.\n\nWhen adopting a European strategy it is important that a franchisor takes expert legal advice. Most often one of the principal tasks in Europe is to find retail space, which is not so significant a factor in the USA. This is where the franchise broker, or the master franchisor, plays an important role. Cultural factors are also relevant, as local populations tend to be heterogeneous.\n\nFrance is one of Europe's largest markets. Similar to the United States, it has a long history of franchising, dating back to the 1930s. Growth came in the 1970s. The market is considered difficult for outside franchisors because of cultural characteristics, yet McDonald's and Century 21 are found everywhere. There are some 30 U.S. firms involved in franchising in France.\n\nThere are no government agencies regulating franchises. The Loi Doubin Law of 1989 was the first European franchise disclosure law. Combined with Decree No. 91-337, it regulates disclosure, although the decree also applies to any person who provides to another person a corporate name, trademark or trade name or other business arrangements. The law applies to \"exclusive or quasi-exclusive territory\". The disclosure document must be delivered at least 20 days before the execution of the agreement or any payments are made.\n\nThe specific and important disclosures to be made are:\n\n\nInitially, there was some uncertainty whether any\nbreach of the provisions of the Doubin Law would\nenable the franchisee to walk away from the contract.\nHowever, the French supreme court (Cour de cassation)\neventually ruled that agreements should only be\nannulled where missing or incorrect information\naffected the decision of the franchisee to enter into the\nagreement. The burden of proof is on the franchisee.\nDispute settlement features are only incorporated in some European countries. By not being rigorous, franchising is encouraged.\n\nUnder Italian law franchise is defined as an arrangement between two financially independent parties where a franchisee is granted, in exchange for a consideration, the right to market goods and services under particular trademarks. In addition, articles dictate the form and content of the franchise agreement and define the documents that must be made available 30 days prior to execution. The franchisor must disclose:\n\nThere are no specific laws regulating franchising in Norway. However, the Norwegian Competition Act section 10 prohibits cooperation which may prevent, limit or diminish the competition. This may also apply to vertical cooperation such as franchising..\n\nIn Russia, under chapter 54 of the Civil Code (passed 1996), franchise agreements are invalid unless written and registered, and franchisors cannot set standards or limits on the prices of the franchisee's goods. Enforcement of laws and resolution of contractual disputes is a problem: Dunkin' Donuts chose to terminate its contract with Russian franchisees who were selling vodka and meat patties contrary to their contracts, rather than pursue legal remedies.\n\nThe legal definition of franchising in Spain is an activity in which an undertaking, the franchisor, grants to another party, the franchisee, for a specific market and in exchange for financial compensation (either direct, indirect or both), the right to exploit an owned system to commercialize products or services already exploited by the franchisor with enough success and experience.\n\nThe Spanish Retail Trading Act regulates franchising. The contents of the franchise must include, at least:\n\nIn Spain, the franchisor submits the disclosure information 20 days prior to signing the agreement or prior to any payment made by the franchisee to the franchisor. Franchisors are to disclose to the potential franchisee specific information in writing. This information has to be true and not misleading and include:\n\nFranchisors (with some exceptions) should be registered in the Franchisors' Register and provide the requested information. According to the regulation in force in 2010 this obligation has to be met within three months after the start of its activities in Spain.\n\nFranchising is a sui generis contract which bears the characteristics of several explicitly regulated contracts such as; agency, sales contract and so forth. The regulations concerning these kinds of contracts in Turkish Commercial Code and in Turkish Code of Obligations are applied to franchising. Franchising is described in doctrine and has several essential components such as; the independence of the franchisee from the franchisor, the use of know-how and the uniformity of product and services, standard use of the brand and logo, payment of a royalty fee, increasement of sales by the franchisee and continuity.\nFranchising may be for a determined or undetermined period of time. The undetermined one can only be annulled either by a notice before a reasonable amount of time or by a just cause. The franchising agreement with a determined time period ends within the end of the time period if not specified otherwise in the agreement. However, termination based on just cause is also foreseen for franchising agreement with a determined time period.\n\nIn the United Kingdom there are no franchise-specific laws; franchises are subject to the same laws that govern other businesses. There is some self-regulation through the British Franchise Association (BFA).\n\nThere are a number franchise businesses which are not members of the BFA and many which do not meet the BFA membership criteria. Part of the BFA's role in self-regulation is to work with franchisors through the application process and recommend changes which will lead to the franchise business meeting BFA standards. A number of businesses that refer to themselves as franchises do not conform to the BFA Code of Ethics are therefore excluded from membership.\n\nOn 22 May 2007, hearings were held in the UK Parliament concerning citizen-initiated petitions for special regulation of franchising by the government of the UK due to losses incurred by citizens who had invested in franchises. The Minister of Industry, Margaret Hodge, conducted hearings but saw no need for any government regulation of franchising with the advice that government regulation of franchising might lull the public into a false sense of security. Mr Mark Prisk MP suggested that the costs of such regulation to the franchisee and franchisor could be prohibitive and would in any case provide a system which mirrored the work already being completed by the BFA. The Minister of Industry indicated that if due diligence were performed by the investors and the banks, the current laws governing business contracts in the UK offered sufficient protection for the public and the banks. The debate also made reference to the self-regulatory function performed by the BFA recognizing that the association \"punched above its weight\".\n\nIsaac Singer, who made improvements to an existing model of a sewing machine in the 1850s, began one of the first franchising efforts in the United States, followed later by Coca-Cola, Western Union, etc. and by agreements between automobile manufacturers and dealers.\n\nModern franchising came to prominence with the rise of franchise-based food service establishments. In 1932, Howard Deering Johnson established the first modern restaurant franchise based on his successful Quincy, Massachusetts Howard Johnson's restaurant founded in the late 1920s. The idea was to let independent operators use the same name, food, supplies, logo and even building design in exchange for a fee. The growth in franchising accelerated in the 1930s when such chains as Howard Johnson's started to franchise motels. The 1950s saw a boom in franchise chains in conjunction with the development of the U.S. Interstate Highway System and the growing popularity of fast food.\n\nIn the United States, the Federal Trade Commission has oversight of franchising, rather than the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The FTC administrates oversight via the FTC Franchise Rule.\n\nThe FTC requires that the franchisee be furnished with a Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD) by the franchisor at least fourteen days before money changes hands or a franchise agreement is signed. The final agreement is always a negotiated document setting forth fees and other terms. Whereas elements of the disclosure may be available from third parties, only that provided by the franchisor can be depended upon. The U.S. Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD) is lengthy (300–700 pp +) and detailed (see Uniform Franchise Offering Circular (UFOC) for elements of disclosure), and generally requires audited financial statements from the franchisor in a particular format, except in some circumstances, such as where a franchisor is new. It must include such data as the names, addresses and telephone numbers of the franchisees in the licensed territory (who may be contacted and consulted before negotiations), estimate of total franchise revenues and franchisor profitability.\n\nIndividual states may require the FDD to contain their own specific requirements, but the requirements in state disclosure documents must be in compliance with the federal rule that governs federal regulatory policy. There is no private right of action of action under the FTC rule for franchisor violation of the rule, but fifteen or more of the states have passed statutes that provide this right of action to franchisees when fraud can be proven under these special statutes. The majority of franchisors have inserted mandatory arbitration clauses into their agreements with their franchisees, some of which the U.S. Supreme Court has dealt with.\n\nThere is no federal registry of franchises or any federal filing requirements for information. States are the primary collectors of data on franchising companies and enforce laws and regulations regarding their presence and their spread in their jurisdictions.\n\nWhere the franchisor has many partners, the agreement may take the shape of a business format franchise – an agreement that is identical for all franchisees.\n\nIn recent years, the idea of franchising has been picked up by the social enterprise sector, which hopes to simplify and expedite the process of setting up new businesses. A number of business ideas, such as soap making, wholefood retailing, aquarium maintenance, and hotel operation have been identified as suitable for adoption by social firms employing disabled and disadvantaged people.\n\nThe most successful examples are probably the \"Kringwinkel\" second-hand shops employing 5,000 people in Flanders, franchised by KOMOSIE, the CAP Markets, a steadily growing chain of 100 neighbourhood supermarkets in Germany. and the Hotel Tritone in Trieste, which inspired the Le Mat social franchise, now active in Italy and Sweden.\n\nSocial franchising also refers to a technique used by governments and aid donors to provide essential clinical health services in the developing world.\n\nSocial Franchise Enterprises objective is to achieve development goals by creating self sustainable activities by providing services and goods in un-served areas. They use the Franchise Model characteristics to deliver Capacity Building, Access to Market and Access to Credit/Finance.\n\nThird-party logistics has become an increasingly more popular franchise opportunity due the quickly growing transportation industry and low cost franchising. In 2012, \"Inc. Magazine\" ranked three logistics and transportation companies in the top 100 fastest growing companies in the annual Inc. 5000 rankings.\n\nEvent franchising is the duplication of public events in other geographical areas, retaining the original brand (logo), mission, concept and format of the event. As in classic franchising, event franchising is built on precisely copying successful events. An example of event franchising is the World Economic Forum, also known as the Davos forum, which has regional event franchisees in China, Latin America, etc. Likewise, the alter-globalist World Social Forum has launched many national events. When The Music Stops is an example of an events franchise in the UK, in this case, running speed dating and singles events.\n\nThe franchising or duplication of another firm's successful home-based business model is referred to as a home-based franchise. Home-based franchises are becoming popular as they are considered to be an easy way to start a business as they may provide a low barrier for entry into entrepreneurship. It may cost little to start a home-based franchise, but experts say that \"the work is no less hard.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "33593125", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33593125", "title": "HYPO CBR", "text": "HYPO CBR\n\nHYPO is a computer program that models reasoning with cases and hypotheticals in the legal domain. It is the first of its kind and the most sophisticated of the case-based legal reasoners, which was designed by Ashley for his Ph.D dissertation in 1987 at the University of Massachusetts Amherst under the supervision of Rissland. HYPO’s design represents a hybrid generalization/comparative evaluation method appropriate for a domain with a weak analytical theory and applies to tasks that rarely involve just one right answer. The domain covers US trade secret law, and is substantially a \"common law\" domain. Since the Anglo-American law is operated under the doctrine of precedent, the definitive way of interpreting problems is of necessity and case-based. Thus, HYPO did not involve the analysis of a Statute, as required by the PROLOG program. Rissland and Ashley (1987) envisioned HYPO as employing the key tasks performed by lawyers when analyzing case law for precedence to generate arguments for the prosecution or the defence.\n\nHYPO was a successful example of a general category of legal expert systems (LESs), it applied artificial intelligence (A.I.) techniques to the domain of legal reasoning in patent law, implementing a case-based reasoning (CBR) system, in contradiction to rule based systems like MYCIN, or mixed-paradigm systems integrating CBR with rule-based or model-based reasoning like IKBALS II. A legal case-based reasoning essentially reasons from previously tried cases, comparing the contextual information in the current input case with that of cases previously tried and entered into the system. As noted by Ashley and Rissland (1988) CBR is used to \"... capture expertise in domains where rules are ill-defined, incomplete or inconsistent\".\n\nThe HYPO project set out to model the creation of hypotheticals in law, where no case matches well enough. HYPO uses hypotheticals for a variety of tasks necessary for good interpretation: \"to redefine old situations in terms of new dimensions, to create new standard cases when an appropriate one doesn’t exist, to explore and test the limits of a concept, to refocus a case by excluding some issues and to organize or cluster cases\". Hypotheticals can include facts that support two conflicting lines of reasoning. So, it makes and responds to arguments from competing viewpoints about who should win the dispute. HYPO use heuristics such as making a case weaker or stronger, making a case extreme, enabling a \"near-miss\", disabling a \"near-hit\" to generate hypotheticals in the context of an argument by using the dimensions mechanism. Dimensions have a range of values, along which the supportive strength that may shift from one side to the other. What differentiated this expert system from others was its facility not only to return a primary to best-case response but to return near-best-fit responses as well.\n\nLegal knowledge in HYPO is contained in: the case-knowledge-base (CKB) and the library of dimensions. The CKB contains HYPO’s base of known cases that are highly structured objects and sub-objects both real and hypothetical in the area of trade secret law. Each case is represented as a hierarchical set of frames whose slots are important facets of the case (e.g. Plaintiff, defendant, secret knowledge, employer/employee data).Ashley’s HYPO system used a database of thirty cases in the area indexed by thirteen dimensions. \nA key mechanism in HYPO is a dimension i.e. a mechanism to allow retrieval from the CKB, in order to represent legal cases. Ashley’s dimensions are composed of (i) prerequisites, which are a set of factual predicates that must be satisfied for the dimension to apply (ii) focal slots, which accommodate one or two of the dimension’s prerequisites designated as being indicative of the case’s strength along that dimension and (iii) range information, which tells how a change in focal slot value effects the strength of a party’s case along a given dimension. Dimensions focus attention on important aspects of cases. In HYPO’s domain of misappropriation of trade secrets the dimension called “secrets voluntary disclosed” captures the idea that the more disclosures the plaintiff has made of his/her putative secret, the less convincing is his/her argument that the defendant is responsible for letting the secret.\n\nHYPO, like any other CBR system has also the following components:\n\n\nHYPO’s method of creating an argument and justifying a solution or position has several steps. HYPO begins its processing with the current fact situation (\"cfs\") which is direct input by the user into HYPO’s representation framework. Once the user inputs the case, HYPO begins its legal analysis. The cfc is analyzed for relevant factors. Based on these factors HYPO selects the relevant cases and produces a case-analysis-record that records which dimensions apply to the cfc and which nearly apply (i.e. are \"near misses\"). The combined list of applicable and near miss dimensions is called the D-list. At this point the fact gathered module may request additional information from the user in order to draw a legal conclusion. Once all the facts are in the case-positioner module it uses the case-analysis record to create the claim lattice. This is a technique that organizes the relevant retrieved cases from the point of view of the cfc and makes it easy for HYPO to ascertain the most-on point cases (mopc) and to least on-point-cases. HYPO’s arguments are 3ply, leading to the construction of the skeleton of an argument: it makes a point for one side, drawing the analogy between the problem and the precedent, responds with an argument for the opponent side, endeavoring to differentiate the cited case and citing other cases as counterarguments. Then it makes a final rebuttal, attempting to differentiate the counterarguments. The claim lattice also enables the HYPO-generator module to produce legally hypotheticals. With its use of dimension-based heuristics, the HYPO-generator does a heuristic search of the space of all possible cases. Lastly, the Explanation module expands upon the argument skeleton and provides explanation and justification for the different lines of analysis and cases found by HYPO.\n\nLegal expert systems are specifically designed to teach an area of law and are useful for pedagogical purposes. Ashley’s work was mainly concerned to build tools to help students understand legal reasoning. Explanation and argument are the bases of the case method used in many professional schools in the U.S., first introduced by the Dean of the Harvard Law School, Christopher Columbus Langdell in 1870. The case method focuses on close readings of cases and principles; it involves students in pointed Socratic dialogue and makes strong use of hypotheticals (“hypos”). Thus, CATO (Aleven 1997) was a research project to device and test an intelligent, case-based tutorial program for teaching law students how to argue with cases implementing the HYPO program.\nWithin the tutor system, Ashley and Aleven (1991) proposed to leverage an understanding of legal reasoning against the standard case-based tutoring methodology. What makes this tutoring system stand out is the additional levels of abstraction involved in its results. The system presents exercises, including the facts of a problem and a set of on-line cases and instructions to make, or respond to, a legal argument about the problem. The student/user will have a set of tools to analyze the problem and fashion an answer comparing it to other cases. Instead of simply generating precedent cases, the system actually functions in such a way as to interpret student responses, comparing them against a list of possibilities and responding to student entries, for example, by citing counterexamples, and providing feedback on a student's problem solving activities with explanations of correctness or giving further hints as to what may be wrong with evaluating a student’s ability to perform legal reasoning and argumentation, examples and follow-up assignments by employing HYPO’s model of case-based structure.\n\nThe quality of HYPO’s results speak for themselves, in that a number of sequent legal reasoning systems are either directly based upon HYPO’s mechanisms as in the case of Kowalski (1991), TAX-HYPO, precedent case-based system operating in the statutory domain of tax law (Rissland and Skalak 1989), CABARET, a mixed-paradigm cases and rule system for the income tax law domain, (Skalak and Rissland 1992), CATO, IBP, developed for argumentation to make predictions based on argumentation concepts (Brüninghaus and Ashley 2003), or their creators at least pay homage to HYPO in their discussions (Henderson and Bench-Capon 2001).\n\n\n\n"}

This is related to the Worker Protection Standard.\n\nSpecifically, this requires unrestricted employee access to the Material Safety Data Sheet or equivalent, and appropriate training needed to understand health and safety risks.\n\nWorkplace safety in the USA began with Dr. Alice Hamilton in Chicago, who began working for the state of Illinois in 1910 to deal with workplace safety.\n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration was established in 1970 to standardize safety for all workers in the United States, and hazard communication for toxic substance exposure was included during the 1980s.\n\nThe Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS) is currently being pursued to standardize workplace hazard protection internationally.\n\nOSHA's Hazard Communication Standard (HAZCOM) was first adopted in 1983 in the United States with limited scope (48 FR 53280; November 25, 1983). In 1987, scope was expanded to cover all industries where employees are potentially exposed to hazardous chemicals (52 FR 31852; August 24, 1987). This is managed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. This is managed by states that have an approved plan.\n\nThe standard is identified in 29 C.F.R. 1910.1200. The summary is as follows.\n\n\"Employers shall maintain copies of any material safety data sheets ... and shall ensure that the material safety data sheets are readily accessible during each work shift to employees when they are in their work area(s); and Employers shall ensure that employees are provided with information and training ... to detect the presence or release of a hazardous chemical in the work area ... <and> the physical and health hazards of the chemials in the work area ...\"\n\nThe United States Department of Defense does not manage hazards in accordance with public law.\n\nEmployees access to hazard information is one of the prerequisites required for access to competent medical diagnosis and treatment.\n\nEnvironmental illness share characteristics with common diseases. Cyanide exposure symptoms include weakness, headache, nausea, confusion, dizziness, seizures, cardiac arrest, and unconsciousness. Influenza and heart disease include the same symptoms. Failure to obtain proper disclosure is likely to lead to improper or ineffective medical diagnosis and treatment.\n\nThe Hazard Communication Standard requires the Material Safety Data Sheet to be made readily available for workplace exposure in the United States, because this information is required by physicians so they can do their job.\n\nPhysicians also require epidemiological data maintained by local government agencies responsible for maintaining pesticide application data for use outside buildings (environmental exposure). This is part of the Right to know.\n"}

This is covered in part 1 Chapter 1. The aim of this part of the Act is to allow for provision of adaptations to disabled persons' homes to reduce both the need for people to relocate to facilities which provide full-time care and to reduce the amount of care needed in people's homes. One way this is provided for is in the provision of stairlifts allowing people to continue use of bathroom facilities in the upstairs of their homes. Local authorities may carry out the work either through provision of money to the applicant or through an agency service. Where an agency service is offered grant applicants are not obliged to take this up in order to receive a grant. In order for adaptation's to be provided an occupational therapist is usually required to carry out an assessment of the needs of the applicant. \n\nA grant can be used for adaptations to give better freedom of movement into and around the home and/or to provide essential facilities within it.

{"id": "9001042", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9001042", "title": "Islamic ethics", "text": "Islamic ethics\n\nIslamic ethics (أخلاق إسلامية), defined as \"good character,\" historically took shape gradually from the 7th century and was finally established by the 11th century. It was eventually shaped as a successful amalgamation of the Qur'anic teachings, the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, the precedents of Islamic jurists (see Sharia and Fiqh), the pre-Islamic Arabian tradition, and non-Arabic elements (including Persian and Greek ideas) embedded in or integrated with a generally Islamic structure. Although Muhammad's preaching produced a \"radical change in moral values based on the sanctions of the new religion and the present religion, and fear of God and of the Last Judgment\", the tribal practice of Arabs did not completely die out. Later Muslim scholars expanded the religious ethic of the Qur'an and Hadith in immense detail. \n\nThe foundational source in the gradual codification of Islamic ethics was the Muslim understanding and interpretations of the Qur'an and practices of Muhammad. Its meaning has always been in context of active submission to God (Arabic: Allah), performed by the community in unison. The motive force in Islamic ethics is the notion that every human being is called to \"command the good and forbid the evil\" in all spheres of life. Muslims understand the role of Muhammad as attempting to facilitate this submission. Another key factor in the field of Islamic ethics is the belief that mankind has been granted the faculty to discern God's will and to abide by it. This faculty most crucially involves reflecting over the meaning of existence. Therefore, regardless of their environment, humans are believed to have a moral responsibility to submit to God's will and to follow Islam (as demonstrated in the Qur'an, ).\n\nThis natural inclination is, according to the Qur'an, subverted by mankind's focus on material success: such focus first presents itself as a need for basic survival or security, but then tends to manifest into a desire to become distinguished amongst one's peers. Ultimately, the focus on materialism, according to the Islamic texts, hampers with the innate reflection as described above, resulting in a state of \"jahiliyya\" or \"heedlessness.\"\nMuslims believe that Muhammad, like other prophets in Islam, was sent by God to remind human beings of their moral responsibility, and challenge those ideas in society which opposed submission to God. According to Kelsay, this challenge was directed against five main characteristics of pre-Islamic Arabia:\n\n\nThese changes lay in the reorientation of society as regards to identity and life of the Muslim belief, world view, and the hierarchy of values. From the viewpoint of subsequent generations, this caused a great transformation in the society and moral order of life in the Arabian Peninsula. For Muhammad, although pre-Islamic Arabia exemplified \"heedlessness,\" it was not entirely without merit. Muhammad approved and exhorted certain aspects of the Arab pre-Islamic tradition, such as the care for one’s near kin, for widows, orphans, and others in need and for the establishment of justice. However, these values would be re-ordered in importance and placed in the context of strict monotheism.\n\nIn the 17th chapter, \"Al-Israa\" (\"The Night Journey\"), verses , the Qur'an provides a set of moral stipulations which are \"among the (precepts of) wisdom, which thy Lord has revealed to thee\" that can be reasonably categorised as ten in number. According to S. A. Nigosian, Professor of religious studies at the University of Toronto, these resemble the Ten Commandments in the Bible and \"represents the fullest statement of the code of behavior every Muslim must follow\". However, these verses are not regarded by Islamic scholars as set apart from any other moral stipulations in the Qur'an, nor are they regarded as a substitute, replacement, or abrogation of some other set of commandments as found in the previous revelations. \n\nMany Muslim theologians see the Golden Rule implicit in some verses of the Qur'an and in the Hadith. The Golden Rule was agreed 1993 also by Muslims as a central unconditional ethical norm in the Declaration Toward a Global Ethic.\n\nMany reforms in human rights took place under Islam between 610 and 661, including the period of Muhammad's mission and the rule of the four immediate successors who established the Rashidun Caliphate. Historians generally agree that Muhammad preached against what he saw as the social evils of his day, and that Islamic social reforms in areas such as social security, family structure, slavery, and the rights of women and ethnic minorities improved on what was present in existing Arab society at the time. For example, according to Bernard Lewis, Islam \"from the first denounced aristocratic privilege, rejected hierarchy, and adopted a formula of the career open to the talents.\" John Esposito sees Muhammad as a reformer who condemned practices of the pagan Arabs such as female infanticide, exploitation of the poor, usury, murder, false contracts, and theft. Bernard Lewis believes that the egalitarian nature of Islam \"represented a very considerable advance on the practice of both the Greco-Roman and the ancient Persian world.\"\n\nThe Constitution of Medina, also known as the \"Charter of Medina\", was drafted by Muhammad in 622. It constituted a formal agreement between Muhammad and all of the significant tribes and families of Yathrib (later known as Medina), including Muslims, Jews, and pagans. The document was drawn up with the explicit concern of bringing to an end the bitter intertribal fighting between the clans of the Aws (Aus) and Khazraj within Medina. To this effect it instituted a number of rights and responsibilities for the Muslim, Jewish and pagan communities of Medina bringing them within the fold of one community-the Ummah. The Constitution established the security of the community, freedom of religion, the role of Medina as a haram or sacred place (barring all violence and weapons), the security of women, stable tribal relations within Medina, a tax system for supporting the community in time of conflict, parameters for exogenous political alliances, a system for granting protection of individuals, a judicial system for resolving disputes, and also regulated the paying of blood-wite (the payment between families or tribes for the slaying of an individual in lieu of lex talionis).\n\nMuhammad made it the responsibility of the Islamic government to provide food and clothing, on a reasonable basis, to captives, regardless of their religion. If the prisoners were in the custody of a person, then the responsibility was on the individual. Lewis states that Islam brought two major changes to ancient slavery which were to have far-reaching consequences. \"One of these was the presumption of freedom; the other, the ban on the enslavement of free persons except in strictly defined circumstances,\" Lewis continues. The position of the Arabian slave was \"enormously improved\": the Arabian slave \"was now no longer merely a chattel but was also a human being with a certain religious and hence a social status and with certain quasi-legal rights.\"\n\nEsposito states that reforms in women's rights affected marriage, divorce, and inheritance. Women were not accorded with such legal status in other cultures, including the West, until centuries later. \"The Oxford Dictionary of Islam\" states that the general improvement of the status of Arab women included prohibition of female infanticide and recognizing women's full personhood. \"The dowry, previously regarded as a bride-price paid to the father, became a nuptial gift retained by the wife as part of her personal property.\" Under Islamic law, marriage was no longer viewed as a \"status\" but rather as a \"contract\", in which the woman's consent was imperative. \"Women were given inheritance rights in a patriarchal society that had previously restricted inheritance to male relatives.\" Annemarie Schimmel states that \"compared to the pre-Islamic position of women, Islamic legislation meant an enormous progress; the woman has the right, at least according to the letter of the law, to administer the wealth she has brought into the family or has earned by her own work.\" William Montgomery Watt states that Muhammad, in the historical context of his time, can be seen as a figure who testified on behalf of women's rights and improved things considerably. Watt explains: \"At the time Islam began, the conditions of women were terrible - they had no right to own property, were supposed to be the property of the man, and if the man died everything went to his sons.\" Muhammad, however, by \"instituting rights of property ownership, inheritance, education and divorce, gave women certain basic safeguards.\" Haddad and Esposito state that \"Muhammad granted women rights and privileges in the sphere of family life, marriage, education, and economic endeavors, rights that help improve women's status in society.\"\n\nSociologist Robert Bellah (\"Beyond belief\") argues that Islam in its seventh-century origins was, for its time and place, \"remarkably modern...in the high degree of commitment, involvement, and participation expected from the rank-and-file members of the community.\" This because, he argues, that Islam emphasized on the equality of all Muslims, where leadership positions were open to all. Dale Eickelman writes that Bellah suggests \"the early Islamic community placed a particular value on individuals, as opposed to collective or group responsibility.\"\n\nPerhaps due to resource scarcity in most Islamic nations, there was an emphasis on limited (and some claim also sustainable) use of natural capital, i.e. producing land. Traditions of haram (site) and hima, an Arabic term meaning \"protected place\", and early urban planning were expressions of strong social obligations to stay within carrying capacity and to preserve the natural environment as an obligation of khalifa or \"stewardship\".\n\nAfter Muslims established themselves in Madinah, Muhammad surveyed the\nnatural resources in the region—the wadis (riverbeds); the rich, black volcanic soil; the high rangelands—and decreed that they be preserved and set aside as a hima.\n\nHadiths on agriculture and environmental philosophy were compiled in the \"Book of Agriculture\" of the \"Sahih Bukhari\", which included the following saying:\n\nSeveral such statements concerning the environment are also found in the Qur'an, such as the following:\n\nThe earliest known treatises dealing with environmentalism and environmental science, especially pollution, were Arabic medical treatises written by al-Kindi, Qusta ibn Luqa, al-Razi, Ibn Al-Jazzar, al-Tamimi, al-Masihi, Avicenna, Ali ibn Ridwan, Ibn Jumay, Isaac Israeli ben Solomon, Abd-el-latif, Ibn al-Quff, and Ibn al-Nafis. Their works covered a number of subjects related to pollution such as air pollution, water pollution, soil contamination, municipal solid waste mishandling, and environmental impact assessments of certain localities. Cordoba, Al-Andalus also had the first waste containers and waste disposal facilities for litter collection.\n\n\"In order to preserve the natural environment by not polluting, plant trees, support environmentally-friendly goods and products, Muslims must rectify themselves through simplicity, contentment, resisting endless desires, and then remembering God as well as following His commands\".\n\nMany medieval Muslim thinkers pursued humanistic and rational approaches in discourses regarding values.\n\nIn the early Islamic Caliphate, the head of state, the Caliph, had a position based on the notion of a successor to Muhammad's political authority, who, according to Sunnis, were ideally elected by the people or their representatives. After the Rashidun Caliphs, later Caliphates during the Islamic Golden Age had a lesser degree of democratic participation, but since \"no one was superior to anyone else except on the basis of piety and virtue\" in Islam, and following the example of Muhammad, later Islamic rulers often held public consultations with the people in their affairs.\n\n\nFred Donner, in his book \"The Early Islamic Conquests\" (1981), argues that the standard Arabian practice during the early Caliphates was for the prominent men of a kinship group, or tribe, to gather after a leader's death and elect a leader from amongst themselves, although there was no specified procedure for this shura, or consultative assembly. Candidates were usually from the same lineage as the deceased leader, but they were not necessarily his sons. Capable men who would lead well were preferred over an ineffectual direct heir, as there was no basis in the majority Sunni view that the head of state or governor should be chosen based on lineage alone. Al-Mawardi has written that the caliph should be Qurayshi. Abu Bakr Al-Baqillani has said that the leader of the Muslims simply should be from the majority. Abu Hanifa an-Nu‘man also wrote that the leader must come from the majority.\n\n\nTraditional Sunni Islamic lawyers agree that \"shura\", loosely translated as 'consultation of the people', is a function of the caliphate. The Majlis ash-Shura advise the caliph. The importance of this is premised by the following verses of the Qur'an:\n\nThe majlis is also the means to elect a new caliph. Al-Mawardi has written that members of the majlis should satisfy three conditions: they must be just, they must have enough knowledge to distinguish a good caliph from a bad one, and must have sufficient wisdom and judgment to select the best caliph. Al-Mawardi also said in emergencies when there is no caliphate and no majlis, the people themselves should create a majlis, select a list of candidates for caliph, then the majlis should select from the list of candidates. Some modern interpretations of the role of the Majlis ash-Shura include those by Islamist author Sayyid Qutb and by Taqiuddin al-Nabhani, the founder of a transnational political movement devoted to the revival of the Caliphate. In an analysis of the shura chapter of the Qur'an, Qutb argued Islam requires only that the ruler consult with at least some of the ruled (usually the elite), within the general context of God-made laws that the ruler must execute. Taqiuddin al-Nabhani, writes that Shura is important and part of \"the ruling structure\" of the Islamic caliphate, \"but not one of its pillars,\" and may be neglected without the Caliphate's rule becoming unIslamic. Non-Muslims may serve in the majlis, though they may not vote or serve as an official.\n\nIslamic legal framework included religious pluralism. Classical Sharia, the religious laws and courts of Christians, Jews and Hindus, were usually accommodated within the Islamic legal framework, as seen in the early Caliphate, Al-Andalus, Indian subcontinent, and the Ottoman Millet system. Non-Muslims were allowed to engage in religious practices that was usually forbidden by Islamic law. In a notable example, Zoroastrian practice of incestuous \"self-marriage\" where a man could marry his mother, sister or daughter, was to be tolerated according to Ibn Qayyim (1292–1350). He based his opinion on the precedent that the prophet Muhammad, who did not forbid such self-marriages among Zoroastrians despite coming in contact with them and having knowledge of their practices. Religious minorities were also free to do whatever they wished in their own homes, provided they did not publicly engage in illicit sexual activity in ways that could threaten public morals.\n\nCitizens of the Rashidun Caliphate were also free to criticize the Rashidun Caliphs, as the rule of law was binding on the head of state just as much as it was for the citizens. In a notable incident, when Umar tried to investigate a disturbance, by entering a home without permission, he was criticized for his behavior; he was also later criticized for the judgement he gave in that case. There were also numerous other situations where citizens insulted Caliph Umar, but he tolerated the insults and simply provided them explanations. Similar situations also occurred during the time of Caliph Ali. For example, there was an occasion when he was giving a sermon and a Kharijite rudely interrupted him with insulting language. Though he was urged to punish the interrupter, Ali declined on the grounds that his \"right to freedom of speech must not be imperilled.\"\n\nImad-ad-Dean Ahmad quotes a letter by a cousin of Caliph al-Ma'mun, in which he gives permission to a Christian he was attempting to convert to speak his mind freely, as evidence that in Islam even religious controversies were not exempt from open discussion. \n\nAccording to George Makdisi and Hugh Goddard, \"the idea of academic freedom\" in universities was \"modelled on Islamic custom\" as practiced in the medieval Madrasah system from the 9th century. Islamic influence was \"certainly discernible in the foundation of the first deliberately planned university\" in Europe, the University of Naples Federico II founded by Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor in 1224.\n\nIn a letter written by the fourth Rashidun Caliph and first cousin of the prophet Muhammad, Ali ibn Abi Talib to his governor of Egypt, Malik al-Ashtar. The Caliph advises his governor on dealings with the poor masses thus:\nIn the field of human rights, early Islamic jurists introduced a number of advanced legal concepts which anticipated similar modern concepts in the field. These included the notions of the charitable trust and the trusteeship of property; the notion of brotherhood and social solidarity; the notions of human dignity and the dignity of labour; the notion of an ideal law; the condemnation of anti-social behavior; the presumption of innocence; the notion of \"bidding unto good\" (assistance to those in distress); and the notions of sharing, caring, universalism, fair industrial relations, fair contract, commercial integrity, freedom from usury, women's rights, privacy, abuse of rights, juristic personality, individual freedom, equality before the law, legal representation, non-retroactivity, supremacy of the law, judicial independence, judicial impartiality, limited sovereignty, tolerance, and democratic participation. Many of these concepts were adopted in medieval Europe through contacts with Islamic Spain and the Emirate of Sicily, and through the Crusades and the Latin translations of the 12th century.\n\nThe concept of inalienable rights was found in early Islamic law and jurisprudence, which denied a ruler \"the right to take away from his subjects certain rights which inhere in his or her person as a human being.\" Islamic rulers could not take away certain rights from their subjects on the basis that \"they become rights by reason of the fact that they are given to a subject by a law and from a source which no ruler can question or alter.\" There is evidence that John Locke's formulation of inalienable rights and conditional rulership, which were present in Islamic law centuries earlier, may have also been influenced by Islamic law, through his attendance of lectures given by Edward Pococke, a professor of Islamic studies.\n\nEarly Islamic law recognized two sets of human rights. In addition to the category of civil and political rights (covered in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights), Islamic law also recognized an additional category: social, economic and cultural rights. This latter category was not recognized in the Western legal tradition until the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in 1966. The right of privacy, which was not recognized in Western legal traditions until modern times, was recognized in Islamic law since the beginning of Islam. In terms of women's rights, women generally had more legal rights under Islamic law than they did under Western legal systems until the 19th and 20th centuries. For example, \"French married women, unlike their Muslim sisters, suffered from restrictions on their legal capacity which were removed only in 1965.\" Noah Feldman, a Harvard University law professor, notes:\n\nIn the \"North Carolina Law Review\" journal, Professor John Makdisi of the University of North Carolina School of Law writes in \"The Islamic Origins of the Common Law\" article:\n\nCount Leon Ostorog, a French jurist, wrote the following on classical Islamic law in 1927:\n\nSome scholars have suggested that the idea of \"a charter defining the duties of a sovereign toward his subjects, as well as subjects toward the sovereign\", which led to the \"genesis of European legal structures\" and the development of the \"Magna Carta\", may have been \"brought back by Crusaders who were influenced by what they had learned in the Levant about the governing system\" established by Saladin. It has also been suggested that \"much of the West’s understanding of liberalism in law, economics and society has roots in medieval Islam.\"\n\nAnother influence of Islamic law on European law was the presumption of innocence, which was introduced to Europe by King Louis IX of France soon after he returned from Palestine during the Crusades. Prior to this, European legal procedure consisted of either trial by combat or trial by ordeal. In contrast, Islamic law was based on the presumption of innocence from its beginning, as declared by the Caliph Umar in the 7th century. Other freedoms and rights recognized in the Islamic legal system based on the Qur'an since the 7th century, but not recognized in the Western world until much later, include \"the rights to know, to choose belief and behaviour, to read and write, the right to power, and even the right to choose government.\"\n\n\nIslamic jurists anticipated the concept of the rule of law, the equal subjection of all classes to the ordinary law of the land, where no person is above the law and where officials and private citizens are under a duty to obey the same law. A Qadi (Islamic judge) was also not allowed to discriminate on the grounds of religion, race, colour, kinship or prejudice. There were also a number of cases where Caliphs had to appear before judges as they prepared to take their verdict. The following hadith established the principle of rule of law in relation to nepotism and accountability:\n\nVarious Islamic lawyers do however place multiple conditions, and stipulations e.g. the poor cannot be penalised for stealing out of poverty, before executing such a law, making it very difficult to reach such a stage. It is well known during a time of drought in the Rashidun caliphate period, capital punishments were suspended until the effects of the drought passed.\n\nAccording to Noah Feldman, a law professor at Harvard University, the legal scholars and jurists who once upheld the rule of law were replaced by a law governed by the state due to the codification of Sharia by the Ottoman Empire in the early 19th century:\n\n\nSunni Islamic lawyers have commented on when it is permissible to disobey, impeach or remove rulers in the Caliphate. This is usually when the rulers are not meeting public responsibilities obliged upon them under Islam. Al-Mawardi said that if the rulers meet their Islamic responsibilities to the public, the people must obey their laws, but if they become either unjust or severely ineffective then the Caliph or ruler must be impeached via the Majlis ash-Shura. Similarly Al-Baghdadi believed that if the rulers do not uphold justice, the ummah via the majlis should give warning to them, and if unheeded then the Caliph can be impeached. Al-Juwayni argued that Islam is the goal of the ummah, so any ruler that deviates from this goal must be impeached. Al-Ghazali believed that oppression by a caliph is enough for impeachment. Rather than just relying on impeachment, Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani obliged rebellion upon the people if the caliph began to act with no regard for Islamic law. Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani said that to ignore such a situation is \"haraam\", and those who cannot revolt inside the caliphate should launch a struggle from outside. Al-Asqalani used two ayahs from the Qur'an to justify this:\n\nIslamic lawyers commented that when the rulers refuse to step down via successful impeachment through the Majlis, becoming dictators through the support of a corrupt army, if the majority agree they have the option to launch a revolution against them. Many noted that this option is only exercised after factoring in the potential cost of life.\n\n\nAccording to scholar Bernard Lewis, the Qur'an and Sunnah have several points to make on governance regarding the right of revolution in Islam:\n\nThe ethical standards of Muslim physicians was first laid down in the 9th century by Ishaq ibn 'Ali al-Ruhawi, who wrote the \"Adab al-Tabib\" (\"Conduct of a Physician\"), the first treatist dedicated to medical ethics. He regarded physicians as \"guardians of souls and bodies\", and wrote twenty chapters on various topics related to medical ethics, including:\n\nBecause Islam views itself as a total system governing all areas, Islamic medical ethics view the patient as a whole. Classical texts speak more about \"health\", than \"illness\", showing an emphasis on prevention rather than cure.\n\nThe earliest known prohibition of illegal drugs occurred under Islamic law, which prohibited the use of Hashish, a preparation of cannabis, as a recreational drug. Classical jurists in medieval Islamic jurisprudence, however, accepted the use of the Hashish drug for medicinal and therapeutic purposes, and agreed that its \"medical use, even if it leads to mental derangement, remains exempt\" from punishment. In the 14th century, the Islamic scholar Az-Zarkashi spoke of \"the permissibility of its use for medical purposes if it is established that it is beneficial.\"\n\nAccording to Mary Lynn Mathre, with \"this legal distinction between the intoxicant and the medical uses of cannabis, medieval Muslim theologians were far ahead of present-day American law.\"\n\nThe first documented description of a peer review process is found in the \"Ethics of the Physician\" by Ishaq ibn 'Ali al-Ruhawi (854–931) of al-Raha, Syria, where the notes of a practising Islamic physician were reviewed by peers and the physician could face a lawsuit from a maltreated patient if the reviews were negative.\n\nIslamic neuroethics and neurotheology hold a sympathetic attitude towards the mentally ill, as exemplified in Sura 4:5 of the Qur'an:\n\nThis Quranic verse summarized Islam's attitudes towards the mentally ill, who were considered unfit to manage property but must be treated humanely and be kept under care by a guardian, according to Islamic law. This positive neuroethical understanding of mental health consequently led to the establishment of the first psychiatric hospitals in the medieval Islamic world from the 8th century, and an early scientific understanding of neuroscience and psychology by medieval Muslim physicians and psychologists, who discovered that mental disorders are caused by dysfunctions in the brain.\n\nThe early Islamic treatises on international law from the 9th century onwards covered the application of Islamic ethics, Islamic economic jurisprudence and Islamic military jurisprudence to international law, and were concerned with a number of modern international law topics, including the law of treaties; the treatment of diplomats, hostages, refugees and prisoners of war; the right of asylum; conduct on the battlefield; protection of women, children and non-combatant civilians; contracts across the lines of battle; the use of poisonous weapons; and devastation of enemy territory.\n\nThe Islamic legal principles of international law were mainly based on Qur'an and the Sunnah of Muhammad, who gave various injunctions to his forces and adopted practices toward the conduct of war. The most important of these were summarized by Muhammad's successor and close companion, Abu Bakr, in the form of ten rules for the Muslim army:\n\nAfter Sultan al-Kamil defeated the Franks during the Crusades, Oliverus Scholasticus praised the Islamic laws of war, commenting on how al-Kamil supplied the defeated Frankish army with food:\n\nAs in other Abrahamic religions, peace is a basic concept of Islam. The Arabic term \"Islam\" itself (إسلام) is usually translated as \"submission\"; submission of desires to the will of God. It comes from the term \"aslama\", which means \"to surrender\" or \"resign oneself\". The Arabic word \"salaam\" (سلام) (\"peace\") has the same root as the word \"Islam\". One Islamic interpretation is that individual personal peace is attained by utterly submitting to Allah. The greeting \"Salaam alaykum\", favoured by Muslims, has the literal meaning \"Peace be with you\". Muhammad is reported to have said once, \"Mankind are the dependents, or slaves of God, and the most beloved of them to God are those who are the most excellent to His dependents.\" \"Not one of you believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself.\" Great Muslim scholars of prophetic tradition such as Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani and Sharafuddin al Nawawi have said that the words \"his brother\" mean any person irrespective of faith.\n\nThe concepts of welfare and pension were introduced in early Islamic law as forms of \"Zakat\" (charity), one of the Five Pillars of Islam, since the time of the Abbasid caliph Al-Mansur in the 8th century. The taxes (including \"Zakat\" and \"Jizya\") collected in the treasury of an Islamic government was used to provide income for the needy, including the poor, elderly, orphans, widows, and the disabled. According to the Islamic jurist Al-Ghazali (Algazel, 1058–1111), the government was also expected to store up food supplies in every region in case a disaster or famine occurs. The Caliphate was thus one of the earliest welfare states. From the 9th century, funds from the treasury were also used towards the \"Waqf\" (charitable trusts), often for the purpose of building of Madrassahs and Bimaristan hospitals.\n\nConcern for the treatment of animals can be found in the Qur'an and in the teachings of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, which inspired debates over animal rights by later medieval Muslim scholars. The 10th-century work, \"Disputes Between Animals and Man\", part of the Epistles of the Brethren of Purity, has been considered a classic in this regard. Inspired by the Qur'anic verse: \"all the creatures that crawl on the earth and those that fly with their wings are communities like yourselves\" (6:38), the Shafi'i jurist 'Izz al-Din Ibn 'Abd al-Salam al-Sulami (d. 1262) formulated the first full-fledged charter of the rights of livestock and animals in his legal treatise \"Rules for Judgement in the Cases of Living Beings\" (\"Qawa'id al-ahkam fi masalih al-anam\") which was based on the stories and sayings of Muhammad.\n\n\n\n"}

The acts provided for the organization of the state militias and provided for the President of the United States to take command of the state militias in times of imminent invasion or insurrection. This authority was used to suppress the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794.\n\nThe Militia Acts were passed in response to the overwhelming U.S. losses at St. Clair's Defeat in 1791. The Constitution permitted Congress to provide for calling forth the militia, but it was understood at the time that the president could not do so on his own authority absent that statutory provision. There was a widespread fear that the Western Confederacy of American Indians would exploit their victory during the recess of Congress. St. Clair's defeat was blamed in part on the poor organization and equipment of his army. Congress took action to remedy these problems in 1792.\n\nThe first Act, passed May 2, 1792, provided for the authority of the president to call out the militias of the several states, \"whenever the United States shall be invaded, or be in imminent danger of invasion from any foreign nation or Indian tribe\". The law also authorized the President to call the militias into Federal service \"whenever the laws of the United States shall be opposed or the execution thereof obstructed, in any state, by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, or by the powers vested in the marshals by this act\". This provision likely referred to uprisings such as Shays' Rebellion. The president's authority in both cases was to expire after two years.\n\nThe second Act, passed May 8, 1792, provided for the organization of the state militias. It conscripted every \"free able-bodied white male citizen\" between the ages of 18 and 45 into a local militia company. (This was later expanded to all males, regardless of race, between the ages of 18 and 54 in 1862.)\n\nMilitia members, referred to as \"every citizen, so enrolled and notified\", \"...shall within six months thereafter, provide himself...\" with a musket, bayonet and belt, two spare flints, a cartridge box with 24 bullets, and a knapsack. Men owning rifles were required to provide a powder horn, ¼ pound of gunpowder, 20 rifle balls, a shooting pouch, and a knapsack. Some occupations were exempt, such as congressmen, stagecoach drivers, and ferryboatmen. \n\nThe militias were divided into \"divisions, brigades, regiments, battalions, and companies\" as the state legislatures would direct. The provisions of the first Act governing the calling up of the militia by the president in case of invasion or obstruction to law enforcement were continued in the second act. Court martial proceedings were authorized by the statute against militia members who disobeyed orders.\n\nThe authority to call forth the militia was first invoked by George Washington to put down the Whiskey rebellion in Western Pennsylvania in 1794, just before the law granting that authority expired. Congress quickly passed the Militia Act of 1795, which by and large mirrored the provisions of the 1792 Act. The Militia Act of 1795 was in turn amended by the Militia Act of 1862, which allowed African-Americans to serve in the militias of the United States. It was superseded by the Militia Act of 1903, which established the United States National Guard as the chief body of organized military reserves in the United States.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "9615682", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9615682", "title": "National Library of Brazil", "text": "National Library of Brazil\n\nThe Biblioteca Nacional do Brasil (English: \"National Library of Brazil\") is the depository of the bibliographic and documentary heritage of Brazil. It is located in Rio de Janeiro,the Capital of Brazil from 1822-1960, more specifically at Cinelândia square.\n\nThe largest library in Latin America and the 7th largest in the world, its collections include about 9 million items. It organized the first library science courses in Latin America and its staff has led the modernization of library services, including the development of online databases.\n\nThe history of the National Library began on 1 November 1755, when Lisbon suffered a violent earthquake. The Royal Library was considered one of the most important libraries in Europe at that time. This irreparable loss to the Portuguese was the impetus for moving many of its contents to Brazil. The collection was brought in three stages, the first being in 1810 and two in 1811. The library of 60,000 books was accommodated initially in the upstairs rooms of the Third Order of Carmel Hospital (in accordance with the charter of July 27, 1810), located in the old back street of Carmel close to the Imperial Palace. The facilities, however, were considered inadequate and could jeopardize valuable collection as well. Therefore, on 29 October 1810, a date that was assigned to the official founding of the National Library, Prince Regent John (later King John VI of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves) issued a decree which provided that a royal library should be established from the funds of the royal treasury.\n\nThe works for the new building of the Library only took place in 1813, when the collection was transferred. While the process of setting up the books, which began in 1810, was taking place the consultation of the Library collection could already be carried out by scholars, by royal consent, and in 1814, after the collection of the collection was completed, the consultation was public.\n\nOfficially established, the library continued to have a significant expansion through purchases, donations, mainly, and \"tips\", that is, by the obligatory delivery of a copy of all printed material in the typographic offices of Portugal (By decree of 12 September 1805) and in the Royal Printing, installed in Rio de Janeiro. This legislation on tips was improved over the years and culminated in Decree No. 1,825 of 20 December 1907, commonly called the Legal Deposit Decree, still in force.\n\nAfter the death of Queen Maria I in March 1816, the reign of King John VI began, and it remained in Brazil until 1821, when political circumstances made him return to Lisbon with the Royal Family, except for his eldest son Prince Pedro de Alcântara of Braganza (future Emperor of Brazil), who came to proclaim the independence of Brazil in 1822. Here also remained the Royal Library. At that time it had grown a lot and, after Independence, in 1822, became property of the Empire of Brazil, because its purchase is included in the Additional Convention to the Treaty of Friendship and Alliance signed between Brazil and Portugal on 29 August 1825. For the goods left in Brazil the Royal Family was indemnified in two million pounds sterling, of that value, eight hundred \"contos de reis\" were destined to the payment of the Royal Library, which was then called the Imperial and Public Library of the Court.\n\nIn 1858, the Library was transferred to the Passeio street, number 60, in Lapa square, and installed in the building that had the purpose to better shelter its collection. As its collection continued to grow with donations, acquisitions and through legal contributions, purchase of rare art collections at auctions and in bookstores around the world, a new building was needed that best suited its needs.\n\nThe constant and permanent growth of the collection of the library was fundamental for the realization of a project of construction of a seat that would attend all the needs of the library, adequately accommodating its collections. Based on this, his current building was designed, which had its cornerstone launched on 15 August 1905, during the government of Rodrigues Alves. The inauguration took place on 29 October 1910, during the Nilo Peçanha government and in the first centenary of the Library.\n\nThe building of the National Library, whose project is signed by the military engineer Sousa Aguiar, has an eclectic style, in which neoclassical and art nouveau elements are mixed, and contains ornaments by artists such as Eliseu Visconti, Henrique and Rodolfo Bernardelli, Modesto Brocos and Rodolfo Amoedo. Eliseu Visconti, still in 1903, had already designed the \"ex-libris\" and the emblem of the National Library.\n\nThe library building is located at Rio Branco Avenue, number 219, Cinelândia Square, in the center of Rio de Janeiro, composing with the National Museum of Fine Arts and the Municipal Theater an architectural and cultural ensemble of great value.\n\nIn 1911, Manoel Cicero Peregrino da Silva started a national union catalog for all Brazilian libraries. He set up the first library science course in South America. Many librarians went on to study in European and North American universities.\n\nIn 1907, presidential Decree no. 1825 established the duty of all publishers to send one copy of each publication to then-called \"Bibliotheca Nacional\". In 2004, this decree was revoked by congressional Law no. 10,994, still in force, upholding the same mandate but updating its provisions.\n\nArticle 1st of Law no. 10,994 specifies that the legal deposit's aim is \"to ensure the registration and custody of national intellectual production, to allow for the control, development and spreading of current Brazilian bibliography, and to defend and preserve national language and culture.\"\n\nAmong the significant collections of the National Library of Brazil is the Teresa Cristina Maria photograph collection, which includes 21,742 photographs dating from the nineteenth century. These photographs were left to the Library by Emperor Pedro II in 1891. This collection has been inscribed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme Register in 2003 in recognition of its world significance and outstanding universal value. It features images related to Brazil's history and people from the 19th century, including photographs by Moritz Lamberg. There are also photographs from Africa, North America, and Europe.\n\n\n\n"}

While similar to traditional record labels in many respects, netlabels typically emphasize free distribution online, often under licenses that encourage works to be shared (e.g., Creative Commons licenses), and artists often retain copyright.\n\nNetlabels may have a considerably lower staff count than traditional record labels, in some instances being only a single individual in control of his/her music, maintaining sole ownership. Physical LPs, for example, are rarely produced by a netlabel, relying entirely on digital distribution and means of the Internet to provide the product. Having no physical product makes the running costs of a netlabel considerably less than a traditional record label and some netlabels have abandoned any financial model altogether and instead, running the netlabel as a hobby. Some employ guerrilla marketing to promote their work.\n\nOnline music groups date back almost as far as the history of personal computers, and share close ties with video games and the demoscene. Early music groups released music in MOD formats, typically as part of a music disk, which often included a MOD player, visual effects, and textual information.\n\nNetlabels began to branch out from the tracker scene when the lossy MP3 file format became popular in the late 1990s. Some are still dedicated to electronic music and related genres, though this is rapidly changing and the quality of downloads are getting higher with the use of FLAC downloads offering CD quality uncompressed music. \n\n\n"}

He has dual United States and British nationality, having become a British citizen in 2005.\n\nKnown as \"The Great Gambo\" and \"The Professor of Pop\", Gambaccini was a BBC Radio 1 presenter for 16 years, including 11 years at the helm of a \"Billboard\" Top 30 countdown show. A regular contributor to BBC Radio 4's long-running arts programme \"Kaleidoscope\", Gambaccini was a long-time TV morning show correspondent for British television, and makes regular appearances on other British TV magazine shows. He was the host of the 12-part Classic FM series \"Paul Gambaccini's Hall of Heroes\", and chairs the Radio 4 music quiz \"Counterpoint\". He is currently the presenter of “Pick of the Pops” on BBC Radio 2 on Saturday afternoons. Inducted into the Radio Academy Hall of Fame in 2005, Gambaccini is the author of more than 15 books.\n\nBorn in the Bronx, New York City, Gambaccini studied at Dartmouth College, where he obtained a degree in history in 1970.\n\nHe then migrated to the United Kingdom and attended University College, Oxford, where he read for a degree in politics, philosophy and economics. He has since returned to Oxford, where he delivered a series of lectures in January and February 2009, as the News International Visiting Professor of Broadcast Media. In February 2010 he was invited by the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University, Andrew Hamilton to deliver the inaugural LGBT lecture \"Out on Monday\" to the university's LGBT staff, students and faculty.\n\nGambaccini's broadcasting career began at Dartmouth College, where he was music director of WDCR, a former student-operated Top 40 radio station. Gambaccini may have first achieved wider prominence when his tips for playlisted songs likely to see greater chart action were published in the 11 May 1968 issue of the international trade publication \"Billboard\", alongside similar tips from radio programming talent at major commercial stations across the United States.\n\nHaving left Oxford, Gambaccini considered further study in law at Harvard or Yale, but had the opportunity of writing for \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, as British correspondent. He attributes his broadcasting career to this post—especially an interview in 1973 with Elton John which brought him to the attention of BBC Radio producer John Walters who arranged for him to present on BBC Radio 1.\n\nGambaccini then started broadcasting in the UK, on BBC Radio 1, September 1973, which he did for 13 years, first as a music reporter on the John Peel Saturday show, \"Rockspeak\". He started his own U.S. chart show on 27 September 1975. He was the presenter of the \"Billboard\" US Top 30 singles chart in the UK every Saturday afternoon until his last show on 8 February 1986. Thereafter, he moved to independent radio to host \"American Countdown\". In 1990, he returned to Radio 1, but left during the tenure of controller Matthew Bannister in 1993.\n\nIn 1992, Gambaccini became a founding presenter on the UK's classical music station Classic FM, where he presented the weekly Classical CD Chart show. He left for BBC Radio 3 in 1995, where he presented an hour-long morning programme, in a slot formerly used for \"Composer of the Week\". He returned to Classic FM in 1997.\n\nAlongside his work in music radio, he contributed regularly to BBC Radio 4's long-running arts programme \"Kaleidoscope\" between 1975 and 1998.\n\nFor 13 years Gambaccini reviewed films for breakfast television, first on TV-am and then GMTV. In the early 1980s he presented \"The Other Side of the Tracks\" on Channel 4, which ran for three series. His other television appearances include \"Pebble Mill at One\", \"Call My Bluff\", \"Music for the Millennium\", and \"The South Bank Show\".\n\nIn 1998, he joined BBC Radio 2. His first show was on 18 April 1998, once again opening the first of his weekly shows \"America's Greatest Hits\" with \"Born to Run\" by Bruce Springsteen. In 2002, he quit his role at Classic FM, to present a weekly chart show on London's Jazz FM until 2004. He was also a contributor to the London station LBC when it was taken over by Chrysalis.\n\nHe has worked widely across the BBC and the British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS) as well as contributing to many television shows, mostly related to music, film, and the arts. He narrated the BBC Radio adaptation of \"Espedair Street\", the Iain Banks novel.\n\nGambaccini has presented the annual Ivor Novello Awards since 1990, the Parliamentary Jazz Awards since 2005, the Music Industry Trust's Man of the Year Dinner since 1999, and the Radio Academy Awards for a ten-year stretch from 1998 to 2008.\n\nIn August 2008, Gambaccini returned to Classic FM, to present a 12-part series \"Paul Gambaccini's Hall of Heroes\" on Sunday evenings between 9 pm and 10 pm. In March 2008, he took over as chairman of the Radio 4 music quiz \"Counterpoint\" from Edward Seckerson; he was temporarily replaced in 2013 by Russell Davies and returned to the show in November 2014 after being cleared of allegations of historical sexual offences made against him. He returned to Radio 2 with \"America's Greatest Hits\" on 15 November 2014 and hosted it until 2 July 2016 when he took over Pick of the Pops from Tony Blackburn, the following week. He started his final America's Greatest Hits' with Born to Run\" by Bruce Springsteen and ended it with Justin Timberlake.\n\nTrevor Nelson took over the Saturday timeslot that was allocated to Gambaccini's \"America's Greatest Hits\" programme for many years.\n\nGambaccini was co-author of \"The Guinness Book of British Hit Singles\" and related titles, with Tim and Jo Rice, alongside Radio 1 colleague at that time, Mike Read, between 1977 and 1996. Gambaccini's own books include \"Love Letters\", \"Radio Boy\", \"Top 100 Albums\" and \"Track Records\". \"The Ultimate Man\", a musical about a comic book superhero, was co-written with Alastair King and Jane Edith Wilson, and produced at the Bridewell Theatre in London in 2000.\n\nGambaccini was active in the realm of comic book fandom. As an American teenager in the 1960s his missives were regularly published in the letter columns of titles such as \"Justice League of America\" and \"The Amazing Spider-Man\". Gambaccini claims to have invented the term \"Brand Echh\", which later became widely used by Stan Lee.\n\nWhile still in high school, Gambaccini began contributing to comics fanzines, including the publication \"Rocket's Blast Comicollector\". In 1964 he succeeded Jerry Bails (the so-called \"father of comic book fandom\") as executive secretary of the Academy of Comic-Book Fans and Collectors, an umbrella organization for the burgeoning world of comics fandom. As part of his involvement with the academy, Gambaccini helped organize the comics industry's first awards, the Alley Awards.\n\nGambaccini and television presenter Jonathan Ross co-owned Top 10 Comics, a comic shop in London which opened in 1989 and closed in 1995. Gambaccini has been an official guest at many British comic conventions, including the United Kingdom Comic Art Convention (where he co-presented the 1990 Eagle Awards and the 1997 National Comics Awards), and Comics Festival UK.\n\nA character introduced in \"The Flash\" #141 named Paul Gambi, a tailor specializing in super-villain outfits, is an homage to Paul Gambaccini.\n\nOn 1 November 2013, it was reported that Gambaccini had been arrested on suspicion of historical sexual offences as part of an investigation by Operation Yewtree in the United Kingdom. He was released on bail and his spokesman said that he denied the allegations.\nIt was announced on 10 October 2014 that no charges would be brought. Giving evidence to the House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee on 3 March 2015, Gambaccini said he believed he was used as human \"fly paper\" to encourage other people to come forward and make allegations against him and that he had lost more than £200,000 in earnings and legal fees. The BBC reported that he also \"said he suspected his bail was repeatedly extended until the end of high-profile cases involving other celebrities because police did not want juries to hear a former Radio 1 DJ had been cleared of sexual wrongdoing\". Gambaccini also argued in favour of a 28-day bail limit; Home Secretary Theresa May had announced in December 2014 that she was consulting on such a limit in all but exceptional cases. However, Gambaccini's allegations of a \"witch-hunt\" were denied by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). The 28-day limit came into effect in April 2017.\n\nGambaccini wrote an account of his experience in his book \"Love, Paul Gambaccini: My Year Under the Yewtree\", which was published in 2015. In February 2016, the Irish Supreme Court Judge Adrian Hardiman used a review of this book to criticize what he described as the radical undermining of the presumption of innocence, especially in sex cases, including Gambaccini's case, by the methods used in Operation Yewtree (among other instances). In February 2017, Gambaccini sued the Metropolitan Police, citing a loss of £200,000 during his time under investigation. In November 2018, he settled a claim against the Crown Prosecution Service, who agreed to pay him damages; the amount paid to Gambaccini by the CPS was not disclosed due to confidentiality clauses in the settlement agreement.\n\nGambaccini has been a supporter of gay-related charities. In 1995, he was named Philanthropist of the Year by the National Charity Fundraisers for his work on behalf of the Terrence Higgins Trust. He is a patron of the London Gay Symphony Orchestra. In 2010, he won an episode of celebrity \"Mastermind,\" with his chosen beneficiary charity being Stonewall.\n\nGambaccini has always been openly gay, asserting in 2013: \"I was never 'in'.\" In June 2012, he entered into a civil partnership with Christopher Sherwood. One week later, they married in New York Botanical Garden.\n\nIn 2013, Gambaccini revealed he had been highlighted as a potential security risk by the BBC earlier in his career due to his sexuality.\n\nHe lives in the South Bank area of London.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "47187551", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47187551", "title": "Policy entrepreneur", "text": "Policy entrepreneur\n\nPolicy entrepreneur refers to an individual who takes advantage of opportunities to influence policy outcomes to increase their self-interests. The term was first coined by American political scientist John W. Kingdon in his influential work \"Agendas, Alternatives and Public Policies\" published in 1995. Kingdon created the Multiple Streams Framework (MSF) which outlines that the policy process can be situated into problems, policy and politics. Political entrepreneurs are most active in the policy stream, creating solutions to potential problems and bringing them forth to the agenda setting process. The Multiple Streams Framework is a powerful tool to understand policy making and agenda setting. It was first created to analyze and understand agenda setting in the United States. Policy entrepreneurs are the most important actors in the Multiple Streams Framework, as they develop policy alternatives and couple them with problems to present solutions to policy makers at the right time. He himself describes them as \"advocates who are willing to invest their resources - time, energy, reputation, money - to promote a position in return for anticipated future gain in the form of material, purposive or solidary benefits\" \nPolicy entrepreneurs use innovative ideas and non-traditional strategies to influence society, create opportunities, and promote desired policy outcomes. Policy entrepreneurship usually happens over three phases. It starts with a demand in the political landscape for some form of innovation involving a public good. Secondly, an innovative policy instrument is proposed to supply that demand. Lastly, strategies are used such as team building, problem definition, and leadership by example to make certain that the innovation is placed on the agenda. Unlike a public intellect who strives to assert themselves into many different topics and be publicly vocal, a policy entrepreneur will focus on specific topics and possibly work behind the scenes with state and political elite.\n\nThe term entrepreneur is derived from the French word entreprendre, i.e. to undertake. The French economist Jean-Baptiste Say first coined the term in 1803 and defined an entrepreneur as an individual who \"shifts economic resources out of an area of lower and into an area of higher productivity and greater yield\". Many decades later, scholars gradually have expanded the use of the idea of entrepreneurship and adapted the concept from business to the public sector. John Kingdon (1984) was one of the earliest scholars to apply the term entrepreneurs to the public sector; he first coined the term \"policy entrepreneur\" in his work Agendas, Alternatives and Public Policies. This new term has been addressed in other works but hasn't been systematically used by other political scientists in theories of policy change.\n\nKingdon’s multiple-streams framework (MSF) has been frequently used since the publication of his book Agendas, Alternatives and Public Policies in 1984. His model is an interpretation of the garbage can model of organizational choice. In a garbage can model, organization is seen as groups of choices that seek out problems, issues and feelings that look for decisions and solutions and people willing to solve them. The multiple-streams adaption of this sees that policies can be created by joining together problems, policies and politics, all of which are seen as decision aspects in a policy process.\n\nGovernment agendas are created when problems are recognized that have viable solutions that will be politically correct to make at the time of decision making. Kingdon recognizes when these three aspects join together using the term \"policy window\". When a policy window is recognized and open, there is a potential for policy making to happen. Policy entrepreneurs function at this time as the action takers who take advantage of these windows while they are open. In the problems stream, conditions are defined as problems based on how an individual values and believes in it and how much of an impact will happen through change. In the policy stream, ideas and solutions are formulated through policy ideas usually developed by specialists to an issue. Policy development has better chance of surviving implementation if it has support from various different communities effected by the policy. The politics stream focuses on different elements that will effect a policy such as national mood, efforts by the people to campaign for change and legislative turnover.\n\nThe multiple-streams framework is considered to provide the best conceptual insight in terms of the presence and influence of policy entrepreneurs and their role in emergence of policy windows by using the three 'streams' to explain the gap between a problem getting attention and the adoption of an impactful solution. Kingdon claims these are not linear processes, instead, these three streams are to be treated as separate streams, able to happen in any order. He states that these three streams must come together at the same time. These streams are that a window of opportunity must exist, as well as a viable solution, combined with the motivation and the opportunity of the policy makers to select the solution. Many opportunities for policy change open, but most of them close before anyone even has a chance to take advantage because the attention of the policy agenda shifts dramatically.\n\nKingdon applied this reasoning to the political system of the United States. Since policy makers do not have the time to devote to detailed policies, they give the responsibility to civil servants who consult with think tanks and interest groups to produce policy solutions. The likelihood of significant policy change is challenging to predict due to it requiring sustained attention, an acceptable solution, and some compromise of the political system. Building on Kingdon's work, Nikolaos Zahariadis defines it as a tool which explains how government policies are created with conditions of ambiguity.\n\nSince 2000, Kingdon's book has been cited over 10,000 through Google Scholar and applied in over 1,900 times in peer reviewed articles.\n\nIn the multiple-streams frameworks, policy entrepreneurs do most of their work in the policy stream working on agenda setting ideas. The role of a policy entrepreneur is to first identify demand for innovation in the political landscape when a recognizable policy window is open. When this window is open, a policy entrepreneur has a limited amount of time to undergo the initial launch of proposing policy recommendations to supply the demand by utilizing their personal, network and institutional resources to take action on joining streams together on their idea through the policy stages. This is done by addressing issues and problems and coming up with solutions to them by creating policy alternatives into a product that they can present as a persuasive agenda that policy-makers should examine. They will implement persuasive strategies and techniques on the policy-makers to coerce their innovation onto the agenda. A successful policy entrepreneur will manage to get their issues onto a political agenda and potentially pass and influence a form of legislation that relates to their personal benefit. However, not every attempt will be successful. If unsuccessful, a policy entrepreneur may hold onto their agenda for a later time or even apply it to a different issue that they deem may work.\n\nThese individuals have a credential that allows their opinions to be heard over others. This could be having expert knowledge on a topic or holding an important position of power in a corporation or special interest group that allows them to make decisions. A policy entrepreneur usually will have a large network of people with political influence that they utilize when pushing their idea forward. Persistence is essential for a policy entrepreneur to be successful. Many hours must be dedicated to their idea by giving speeches and talks, writing papers and speaking in front of government committees if they are to have success.\n\nPolicy entrepreneurs are crucial actors in policy making, Kingdon himself explained that policy entrepreneurs are \"advocates who are willing to invest their resources - time, energy, reputation, money - to promote a position in return for anticipated future gain in the form of material, purposive or solidary benefits\". Other political scientists have taken Kingdon's definition and expanded further. Michael Mintrom applied a public policy perspective to the term stating, “they are individuals who through their creativity, strategy, networking, and persuasive argumentation are able to bring new policy ideas into the open and promote policy change\". Years later, using a constructivist perspective, Michael Mazarr added to this saying, “policy entrepreneurs can be seen as the human embodiment of the social construction of policy. Advocates determined, for one reason or another, to fight inertia, the bureaucracy, opposing interests, and anything else in their way to get the idea through the window [of opportunity] and into law or policy.”.\n\nReviews of Agendas, Alternatives, and Public Policy display mixed opinions on the approaches and concepts created by Kingdon. Roger Cobb, former professor of political science at Brown University writes in an article for the Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law that Kingdon's garbage can model approach is a completely random decision-making tool that lacks content. Cobb states that the greatest contribution of the garbage can model is the creation of new terms like policy entrepreneur that help give the sense of focus on policy problems but then argues that Kingdon himself may not fully believe in what he has created. He criticizes that Kingdon makes a legitimate arguments for structure by writing about “predictable policy windows” that are attributable to different political cycles but makes rations that would contradict his whole argument.\n\nEvelyn Brodkin, associate professor at The University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration, writes in Political Science Quarterly that Kingdon's book provides a good analysis of how policy participants see their own role in influencing others, raising issue awareness and framing these issues for debate. She finds that his findings are beneficial for pursuing more empirical investigation and debate on different models of the agenda-setting process. In her criticism, Brodkin argues that the book fails to challenge criticisms of the pluralist theory that focus on discrepancies that illustrate how certain groups and issues systematically are excluded from the political process in which Kingdon's work is modelled on.\n\nThe frequent use of Kingdons agenda-setting framework in policy analysis is especially interesting because the book focuses solely on the United States. It can be argued that a framework developed exclusively on the basis of the examination of a single nation should not be able to generate useful insight in comparative research across the globe. Still, the MSF has been used in a large number of studies of subnational politics such as the European Union, the United Nations, and countries beyond the USA. Cairney and Zahariadis explain that this is because Kingdon's MSF possesses a language that is flexible enough to be relevant on a wide range of policy making processes. Its insights are universal enough to apply in most political systems.\n\nHarald Sætren, professor at University of Bergen Department of Administration and Organization Theory, writes in Policy Sciences that one of the problems with the multiple-streams framework is that differing methods of finding issues and solutions potentially can effect how successful a policy entrepreneur can be in coupling policy streams.\n\nAs of 2017, \"policy entrepreneur\" is not a recognized job position. John Kingdon's research consisted of case studies on 23 different people he deemed to be policy entrepreneurs.\n\nIsambard Kingdom Brunel is a mechanical engineer that engaged in the debate about whether paddle wheels or screw propellors were more powerful for moving boats. He tested this by building one of each and using them in a channel to see which would tug the hardest. The point of his story is that he was engaged on the ground and not just researching in a lab. Policy entrepreneurs need to be practically involved in testing their theories if they want their recommendations to be considered \n\nIn a study done by Mark Beeson and Diane Stone, Ross Garnaut was examined in a role of a policy entrepreneur. Garnaut was a highly decorated scholar, recognized economist who was also an ambassador to China and a prime ministerial advisor in Australia. In his role as advisor to Prime Minister Hawke, he wrote to him about problems with fixed exchange rates and instituting labour-market reform. The government went on to implement a radical program of economic liberalisation that included addressing some of the issues Garnaut consulted on.\n\n\nCohen, Nissim (2016) “Policy Entrepreneurs and Agenda Setting”.

{"id": "4405346", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4405346", "title": "Safety and Health in Mines Convention, 1995", "text": "Safety and Health in Mines Convention, 1995\n\nSafety and Health in Mines Convention, 1995 is an International Labour Organization Convention. It was adopted at the 82nd International Labour Conference (ILC) of the International Labour Organization (ILO). The ILO is an agency under the United Nations that deals with international labor issues while promoting workers rights and opportunities. One of ILO’s goals is to hold annual labor conventions to create legally binding contracts for participating nations to ratify. During the Safety and Health in Mines Convention (C176), it was recognized that there are inherent hazards in the mining workplace, and a need for a convention was mandatory.\n\nThe outcome of the Convention is that miner’s health and safety is upheld and monitored through various actions involving the mining workplace. The responsible parties would be the government and employer of the countries that ratified the Convention. The laws outlined in the Convention ensure the health and safety of miners. The ILO adopted the Convention on June 22, 1995.\n\nAs of the end of 2015, 31 nations have ratified the Convention. The ILO requires any nation that ratifies a convention to be legally bound to its rules. Because ratifying the convention is optional, many prominent mining nations (including those notorious for mining incidents) have chosen not too participate.\n\nIt was established in 1995, with the preamble stating:\nRecognizing that it is desirable to prevent any fatalities, injuries or ill health affecting workers or members of the public, or damage to the environment arising from mining operations, and\n\nHaving regard to the need for cooperation between the International Labour Organization, the World Health Organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency and other relevant institutions and noting the relevant instruments, codes of practice, codes and guidelines issued by these organizations, and\n\nHaving decided upon the adoption of certain proposals with regard to safety and health in mines...\n\nDue to the hazardous conditions of the mining workplace, the Governing Body of the ILO recognized the need for a convention regarding the health and safety of miners. The ILO wanted to prevent fatalities, injuries and environmental damage as a result of mining.\n\nMining safety has always been a large issue in the overall working industry as numerous fatalities occur each year. As a result of the workplace being underground, the threat of harmful gases being trapped in the workplace is present. Additionally, if any miner were to become trapped due to a cave-in, the extraction process can be extremely difficult and hazardous. There is also a risk of having a secondary collapse since the necessary infrastructure to support the new topography would not be in place after an initial collapse. This would result in additional trapped miners and rescue workers. Since miners are trapped in pockets of rock, the risk of an explosion and oxygen deprivation is high.\n\nAs of 2001, more than 30 million people were employed in the mining industry. Despite that being only 1% of the world’s workforce, mining holds over 8% of workplace fatalities. These statistics concerned the ILO, forcing them to hold a convention in order to decrease these statistics.\n\nBefore the Safety and Health in Mines Convention, there were numerous other conventions that were slightly relevant to health and safety in the mines such as The Safety and Health in Construction Convention and Recommendation, The Prevention of Major Industrial Accidents Convention and Recommendation, and The Medical Examination of Young Persons (Underground Work) Convention. However, despite the many conventions that were relevant, there were not enough laws and conditions specifically laid out for miner’s health and safety. Therefore, the Safety and Health in Mines Convention was created.\n\nThe document consists of 24 articles contained within 5 parts, preceded by a preamble.\n\n\nIn Article 19 of Part 5, the process of denouncing the Convention is laid out. Countries are allowed to denounce the Convention only under certain circumstances. The article states that a country may denounce the Convention if they wish, only ten years after the Convention first came into force (in 1998). Therefore, in 2008 it was possible for any ratifying countries to eliminate the Convention and subsequently drop their enforcement of its laws. This would result in a major loss of support for miner’s health and safety, and even basic rights. As a result, no countries have yet to denounce the Convention.\n\nThe 42nd President of The United States, Bill Clinton, signed the Convention on January 5, 2001 with guidance from the Secretary of Labor, Alexis Herman. The United States was the 16th country to ratify the Convention. The United States ratification of the Convention showed its international support for miners who work in hazardous conditions.\n\nSince the Convention contains laws that are enforceable by the government, the United States would be held accountable for the all of the laws contained within it. However, the United States already enforces many laws relevant to the Convention. The Department of Labor has a division applicable to miners. This division, The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), is an agency that since 1977 has a mission to promote a safe and healthy workplace for miners by preventing injury and disease. The main method of doing this is by enforcing the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, known as the Mine Act. The Mine Act sets various standards intended to reduce fatal accidents and to minimize health hazards in an already dangerous occupation. Having the MSHA inspect every American mine accomplishes a part of the Mine Act. In addition, the MSHA handles all accident reporting and safety issues from miners. The disease black lung, which largely affects miners, is being worked on by the MSHA to have it diminished in the United States. Similarly, the laws outlined in the Convention are aimed at lowering the amount of individuals with disease obtained from the mining workplace.\n\nAs a result of the already implemented MSHA and the Mine Act in the United States, it was not clear whether or not the Convention ratification would make a large impact in the various mining health and safety laws. A tripartite panel consisting of representatives covering American government, labor and business was held. They compared the laws from the Convention and the laws set in place by the Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. They concluded that the Convention could be signed by the president and ratified without the introduction of any new laws. This was due to the MSHA already enforcing all of the laws stated within the Convention.\n\nEven though the ratification would not introduce any new laws, Bill Clinton signed the Convention in 2001. The reason for the ratification was a political and economic strategy. The United States had an interest in holding other countries accountable for miner’s health and safety. By ratifying the Convention, the United States could reach out to other countries that have ratified it for failing to comply. If the United States had not ratified the Convention, it would be difficult to task other countries for failure to enforce the applicable laws.\n\nAt least 301 miners were killed in Soma, Turkey after an explosion sent poisonous gasses throughout the mine. More than 100 workers survived the explosion and subsequent gas, but were killed as a result of the mine collapsing onto them. Backlash against the government and the mine operator was strong and negligence investigations ensued. The general manager and the operations manager were held on suspicion of neglect, which caused numerous deaths. During the Soma disaster, a commission from the International Labor Organization was sent to discuss miner’s health and safety with Turkish officials. The Turkish Labor minister, Faruk Celik, claimed that strict laws were already in place in Turkey. In addition, Turkey claimed to be in full compliance with European Union standards and had laws even more advanced than the ILO Convention.\n\nIndustriALL, a global union that represents 50 million workers from 146 countries, wanted Turkey to swiftly ratify the Convention following the Soma disaster. One of their goals as a global union is to make the worlds mines safer. They claim that the best way to accomplish this is by having countries ratify the Convention and fully implement the laws and safety regulations contained within it. In addition, they state that the first priority of mining is to promote the safety and well being of miners. By favoring profit first, it should be considered criminal behavior that should be intolerable.\n\nFollowing the Soma disaster, debates occurred in Turkey as to whether or not the government was protecting its miners from disasters like this. Turkey was largely hesitant to begin ratification processes due to employer backlash of the cost to uphold to the Conventions rules and regulations. In the end, the Turkish Parliament’s General Assembly on December 4, 2014 decided to formally adopt the Convention. Turkey notice of ratification of the treaty was deposited on 23 March 2015.\n\nHowever, this has not been a perfect resolution. Many employers are unable to cover the cost of the resulting changes. As a result, many companies have been forced to lay off workers and shut down mines.\n\nPneumoconiosis, also known as black lung, is a fatal health illness present in the mining industry caused by prolonged exposure to mine dust. In the United States, black lung has caused 76,000 deaths since 1968. So far, 45 billion dollars have been spent in federal compensation towards miners and their dependents in the United States. Despite the large economic and death toll, black lung is entirely preventable. A mine that is equipped with good ventilation and newer tools is at a much lower (or nonexistent) risk for miners contracting black lung.\n\nThe risk of black lung in The United States has been nearly eliminated today. On the other hand, China (which has yet to ratify the Convention) had a total of 750,000 cases in 2013. That number is likely larger, but reporting is much less common in smaller Chinese mines. Ventilation, replacing dusty and hazardous air with fresh air, is the best way to prevent miners from contracting black lung.\n\nArticle 7 of the Convention requires that employers take measures to minimize the risk of disease. This includes having good ventilation in all locations of the mine in which miners come in contact with. The Convention also requires that the working environment is monitored for hazards that can induce disease. Finally, article 5 requires that countries publish statistics on occupational disease (included black lung).\n\nThe goal of the Convention is to create a standard that can be used for any ratifying nations to promote the health and safety of miners. It supports the notion for countries to create the proper agencies to regulate the safety and health of miner’s and implement standards. However, many prominent mining countries have yet to ratify the Convention. In addition, many ratifying nations differ in the amount of effort put into the relevant agencies.\n\nCurrently there are five main developed countries that are prominent in the mining industry. Only two of these five have ratified the Convention (The United States and Germany). There are a number of developing nations that also largely partake in mining. Despite this, only a fraction have signed the Convention. China, the worlds leading coal producer, has yet to ratify the Convention. China also has the most dangerous track record of miner’s health and safety (based on number of fatalities).\n\nApart from the countries that haven't ratified it, the effectiveness of the Convention relies on the strictness of the government. The ratifying nations are ultimately responsible for creating the relevant agencies and enforcing the standards laid out in the Convention.\n\nIn 2008, the European Commission released a Recommendation for all EU members to ratify recent conventions from the ILO, including Convention 176. Similar to the United States, many EU member States have laws already in place that would match or in some cases surpass the laws laid out in the Convention. However, the Recommendations laid out by the Commission did not just ask for the ratification of the various conventions. The Commission recognized the notion that governments can ratify, yet not enforce the Convention fully. Therefore, it asked for the conventions rules to be strengthened and made certain that a supervisory system was in place to monitor the effectiveness of the conventions enforcement. The Recommendation was released despite opposition from some EU nations claiming that the funding to the ILO should be lowered or in some cases dropped.\n\nAs of the end of 2015, 31 countries have ratified the convention.\n\n"}

{"id": "2040018", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040018", "title": "Sony/ATV Music Publishing", "text": "Sony/ATV Music Publishing\n\nSony/ATV Music Publishing LLC is an American music publishing company owned by Sony Entertainment. It is the largest music publishing administrator in the world, with a library of 4.36 million songs as of March 31, 2018 (according to Sony's fiscal year 2018 annual report). This figure combines Sony/ATV's 2.3 million songs and the 2.06 million songs of EMI Music Publishing it administers.\n\nThe company was formed in 1955 as Associated Television (ATV), a British television broadcaster and production studio. ATV acquired Northern Songs, publisher of the Lennon–McCartney song catalogue, in 1969. Entertainer Michael Jackson purchased ATV Music in 1985 for $47.5 million. Ten years later in December 1995, Jackson agreed to merge the company with Sony Music Publishing, a Sony Corporation division, to form a 50:50 joint venture, which would become Sony/ATV Music Publishing. As ATV Music was worth more, Michael Jackson received an additional $110 million. At the time, about two thirds of ATV's value was tied to the Beatles' songs.\n\nIn 2012, an investor consortium led by Sony/ATV Music Publishing acquired EMI Music Publishing for approximately $2.2 billion, with Sony/ATV owning about 30% and the Michael Jackson Estate about 10%. Sony/ATV and EMI Music Publishing operate as one company, with Sony/ATV administering the catalogue of EMI Publishing. Subsequent to the acquisition, Sony/ATV became the largest music publishing administrator in the world, with a library of over 3 million songs. \nIn September 2016, Sony bought the Jackson estate's 50% stake in Sony/ATV<ref name=\"Sony Finalizes Acquisition of Michael Jackson Estate's Stake in Sony/ATV Publishing\"></ref> for $750 million, valuing Sony/ATV at between $2.2 to $2.4 billion (including debt). In October 2018, the European Commission approved Sony/ATV's outright acquisition of EMI Music Publishing.\n\nAssociated Television (ATV) was a British television broadcasting company founded in 1955 by Lew Grade. Over the next two decades, ATV expanded through acquisitions to become an entertainment conglomerate with business lines in the record industry, music publishing and film production.\n\nATV entered the music industry in 1958 when it acquired 50% of Pye Records, a British record company. ATV expanded into music publishing in 1966 when it acquired 50% of New World Music and Jubilee Music, subsidiaries of Chappell & Co. ATV also acquired the other 50% of Pye Records, making it a wholly owned subsidiary of ATV, including Pye Record's publishing subsidiary Welbeck Music.\nATV acquired Northern Songs, publisher of the Lennon–McCartney song catalogue, in 1969. The catalog featured almost every song written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Northern Songs was co-owned by Lennon, McCartney, Brian Epstein and Dick James, who owned a controlling interest. In 1969, James offered to sell his shares to ATV. Lennon and McCartney then attempted to gain a controlling interest in the company. Their bid to gain control, part of a long and acrimonious fight, failed. The financial clout of Grade, their adversary in the bidding war, ensured that the songs written by the two Beatles passed into the control of ATV.\n\nIn 1970, ATV formed a joint publishing venture with Kirshner Entertainment, called ATV-Kirshner Music. The partnership agreement expired at the end of 1972 at which time ATV Music was formed to manage all of ATV's publishing interests, including Northern Songs. ATV Music remained a successful organization in the music industry throughout the 1970s, largely due to the performance of Northern Songs. ATV Music also entered into co-publishing agreements with Lennon and McCartney, whose contract with Northern Songs expired in 1973.\n\nWhile ATV Music was successful, its parent company, now known as Associated Communications Corporation (ACC) began experiencing financial difficulties. From 1978 to 1981, ACC's profits declined due to losses in its film division, and share prices dropped dramatically. The main television arm of ATV lost its government-granted license in its then-current form and was restructured into Central Independent Television. In 1981, Grade entertained offers for Northern Songs, drawing interest from several bidders. McCartney, with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono, offered £21 million but the offer was declined by Grade who decided not to sell Northern Songs separately after other suitors, including , EMI Music Publishing, Warner Communications, Paramount Pictures and the Entertainment Co. showed interest in buying ATV Music as a whole.\n\nMeanwhile, Australian businessman Robert Holmes à Court had been acquiring shares of ACC and launched a takeover bid in earnest in January 1982. Grade resigned as chairman and was replaced by Holmes à Court who successfully acquired a controlling interest in the company. After Holmes à Court assumed control of ACC, ATV Music was no longer for sale.\n\nDuring this time, American singer Michael Jackson was recording \"Say Say Say\" for Paul McCartney's \"Pipes of Peace\" album. Jackson stayed at the home of McCartney and his wife Linda during the recording sessions, becoming friendly with both. One evening while at the dining table, McCartney brought out a thick, bound notebook displaying all the songs to which he owned the publishing rights. Jackson grew more excited as he examined the pages. He inquired about how to buy songs and what the songs were used for. McCartney explained that music publishing was a way to make big money. Jackson replied by telling McCartney that he would buy The Beatles' songs one day. McCartney laughed, saying \"Great. Good joke.\"\n\nJackson was first informed that the ATV catalog was up for sale in September 1984 by his attorney, John Branca, who had put together Jackson's earlier catalogue acquisitions. Warned of the competition he would face in buying such popular songs, Jackson remained resolute in his decision to purchase them. Branca approached McCartney's attorney to query whether the Beatle was planning to bid. The attorney stated he wasn't; it was \"too pricey.\" According to Bert Reuter, who negotiated the sale of ATV Music for Holmes à Court, \"We had given Paul McCartney first right of refusal but Paul didn't want it at that time.\" Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono had been contacted as well but also did not enter bidding.\n\nThe competitors in the 1984 sale of ATV Music included Charles Koppelman and Marty Bandier's New York-based the Entertainment Co., Virgin Records, New York real estate tycoon Samuel J. LeFrak, and financier Charles Knapp. On November 20, 1984, Jackson sent a bid of $46 million to Holmes à Court. Branca suggested the amount of the bid after having spent time evaluating the earnings of the catalogue and learning of another bid for $39 million. Jackson was only interested in the music copyrights, but the package also included buildings, a recording studio and studio equipment. The two sides signed a non-binding memorandum of mutual interest in December 1984 and Jackson's team began a four-month process of verifying ATV Music's legal documents, financial reports, and every significant composition in the nearly 4000-song catalog.\n\nThe two sides began drafting contracts in January 1985 and follow-through meetings began on March 16. Jackson's team described the negotiations as frustrating, with frequent shifts of position by the seller. One Holmes à Court representative described the negotiations as a \"game of poker\". Jackson's team thought they had reached a deal several times, but new bidders would enter the picture or they would encounter new areas of debate. The prospective deal went through eight drafts. In May 1985, Jackson's team walked away from negotiations after having spent hundreds of hours and over $1 million. In June 1985, they learned Koppelman/Bandier had made a tentative agreement with Holmes à Court to buy the catalog for $50 million.\n\nBut in early August, Holmes à Court contacted Jackson and talks resumed. Jackson only raised his bid to $47.5 million, but he had the advantage of being able to close the deal faster, having completed due diligence of ATV Music prior to any formal agreement. He also agreed to visit Australia as a guest of Holmes à Court and appear on the Channel Seven Perth Telethon. Holmes à Court included some more assets and agreed to establish a scholarship in Jackson's name at a U.S. university. Branca closed the deal and purchased ATV Music on Jackson's behalf for $47.5 million on August 10. 1985. In October 1985, Jackson fulfilled his contract provision to visit Perth, Western Australia and appear on the telethon, where he spoke briefly and met with two children.\n\nThe only Beatles song in the Northern Songs catalog that was excluded from the sale was \"Penny Lane\", the rights to which were gifted by Holmes à Court to his then-teenage daughter Catherine before the sale, as it was her favorite Beatles song.\n\nIn an analysis of the acquisition, the \"Los Angeles Times\" noted that if \"Yesterday\" were to earn $100,000 a year in royalties, the Lennon estate and McCartney would divide 50% of the income; $25,000 each. The publisher, Jackson, would receive the other 50%; $50,000. It was mentioned that \"Yesterday\" probably earns more than $100,000 a year. The publisher would also control the use of the song in films, commercials and stage productions. Jackson went on to use the Beatles' songs in numerous commercials, feeling that it would enable a new generation of fans to enjoy the music. McCartney, who had himself used the Buddy Holly song catalogue in commercials, felt saddened. Privately, Jackson was reported to have expressed exasperation at McCartney's attitude; he felt that the musician should have paid for the songs he had written. At the time, McCartney was one of the richest entertainers in the world, with a net worth of $560 million and a royalty income of $41 million. Jackson stated, \"If he didn't want to invest $47.5 million in his own songs, then he shouldn't come crying to me now.\"\n\nAppearing on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\" shortly after Jackson died in 2009, McCartney spoke about Jackson's acquisition of the Beatles songs and the impact of it on their relationship:And which was, you know, that was cool, somebody had to get it, I suppose. What happened actually was then I started to ring him up. I thought, OK, here's the guy historically placed to give Lennon–McCartney a good deal at last. Cuz we got signed when we were 21 or something in a back alley in Liverpool. And the deal, it's remained the same, even though we made this company the most famous… hugely successful. So I kept thinking, it was time for a raise. Well you would, you know. [David Letterman: Yes, I think so.] And so it was great. But I did talk to him about it. But he kind of blanked me on it. He kept saying, \"That's just business Paul.\" You know. So, \"yeah it is\", and waited for a reply. But we never kind of got to it. And I thought, mm... So we kind of drifted apart. It was no big bust up. We kind of drifted apart after that. But he was a lovely man, massively talented, and we miss him.\n\nOno was pleased that Jackson had acquired Northern Songs and called it a \"blessing\". Speaking in November 1990, Ono stated, \"Businessmen who aren't artists themselves wouldn't have the consideration Michael has. He loves the songs. He's very caring.\" She added that if she and McCartney were to own the songs, there would certainly be arguments. Ono explained that neither she nor McCartney needed that. \"If Paul got the songs, people would have said, 'Paul finally got John.' And if I got them, they'd say, 'Oh, the dragon lady strikes again.'\"\n\nMichael Jackson record label's owner, US-based media group CBS Corporation, was negotiating the sale of its record division at the end of the 1980s. Sony, which sought to diversify into music, films and games, acquired CBS Records Inc. in January 1988, then changed its name to Sony Music Entertainment Inc. in January 1991 (then Sony Music Holdings Inc. in December 2008). Looking for further opportunities, Sony aimed to expand its music publishing interests and offered Jackson $110 million for a 50% stake in a combined ATV and Sony Music Publishing joint venture. Following hurriedly arranged meetings and disagreements over the selling price, a deal was sealed by Jackson during a concert in Tokyo. Jackson had essentially sold half ownership of the Beatles' and others' songs for a large profit. Jackson's own songs, grouped in the Mijac catalog, were not included in the deal.\n\nThe new company was named Sony/ATV Music Publishing and became the second largest music publisher in the world. Michael P. Schulhof, President and CEO of Sony Corporation of America, welcomed the merger and praised Jackson for his efforts in the venture. \"Michael Jackson is not only the most successful entertainer in history; he is also an astute businessman. Michael understands the importance of copyrights and the role they play in the introduction to new technologies.\" He added that Jackson recognises Sony's \"leadership in developing and realizing new technologies that serve to expand the creative horizon of artists such as himself\". Administrative expertise was provided by Sony, who installed Paul Russell as chairman. Jackson was a company director and attended board meetings regularly. As each party in the arrangement held the power of veto, both sides would have to agree on a decision before it could be made. If neither party agreed on a decisions, they would not be implemented.\n\nIn 2006, Sony gained operational control of Sony/ATV and obtained an option to buy half of Jackson's stake in the company at any time for a fixed price of $250 million.\n\nSony/ATV Music Publishing continued to acquire song catalogues in the 21st century.\n\nIn November 2001, the company signed country singer Tony Martin to an exclusive songwriting and co-publishing deal. Through the deal, they acquired Martin's Baby Mae Music catalog of 600 songs, which includes Joe Diffie's \"Third Rock from the Sun\" and Jeff Carson's \"Not on Your Love\".<ref name=\"Sony/ATV Music Publishing signs Tony Martin\"></ref>\n\nIn July 2002, Sony/ATV Music Publishing bought veteran country music publisher Acuff-Rose Music for $157 million. The venture included music publishing rights to 55,000 country music songs, including the music of Hank Williams, The Everly Brothers and Roy Orbison, and the master recordings of the defunct label Hickory Records. Sony/ATV revived Hickory Records as the in-house record label imprint in 2007, with distribution handled by Sony Music's RED Distribution. Sony/ATV also owns the masters of Dial Records, Four Star Records and Challenge Records.\n\nAnother company acquisition was made in 2007, when Sony/ATV purchased Famous Music, a music publishing business with song catalogue of more than 125,000 songs including \"Moon River\" and \"Footloose\", for $370 million. The deal, sought by Viacom, included the assumption of around $30 million of debt. The song catalogue also includes the hits of Eminem, Akon, Linda Perry, Björk, Shakira and Beck, as well as music from films released by Viacom divisions Paramount Pictures (which had founded Famous Music in 1928) and DreamWorks Pictures.<ref name=\"Viacom sells Famous Music to Sony/ATV\"></ref>\n\nDigital sheet music provider Musicnotes.com announced in June 2006 that it had signed a long-term distribution agreement with Sony/ATV Music Publishing. Musicnotes.com would produce and sell digital sheet music and guitar tablature for songs from Sony/ATV's extensive catalog.<ref name=\"Sony/ATV songs to be available in digital sheet music\"></ref> \"As a music publisher, we are always looking for new and innovative ways to promote our songs and songwriters,\" Sony/ATV chairman and chief executive David Hockman announced in a statement.\n\nOn June 27, 2017, Sony/ATV agreed to administer the music publishing rights of French motion picture company EuropaCorp, soon after acquiring 1,500 music copyrights from the studio. Other major studios that rely on Sony/ATV's administration include Paramount, Nickelodeon, MTV Networks, Showtime, CBS, and DreamWorks (all since the Famous Music acquisition); Sony Pictures, 20th Century Fox, A+E Networks, Endemol Shine Group, Hit Entertainment, ITV Studios, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.\n\nIn November 2011, Citigroup announced a deal to sell EMI in two pieces. Recorded music went to Vivendi's Universal Music Group for $1.9 billion. EMI Music Publishing went to a Sony/ATV-led consortium for around $2.2 billion. Other members of the Sony consortium included the Michael Jackson Estate (about 10% ownership), US media billionaire David Geffen, US investment firm Blackstone and Abu Dhabi state-owned investment fund Mubadala. The deal won European Union approval in April 2012, on conditions some catalogs are divested. The global publishing rights for Famous Music UK and Virgin Music were sold to BMG Rights Management in December 2012 for $150 million.\n\nWhile Sony/ATV acquired about 30% of EMI Publishing, it put up a much lower cash contribution. In exchange, it agreed to administer the entire catalog. Sony/ATV became the largest music publisher administrator company in the world with more than 3 million songs and estimated revenues of over US$1.25 billion per year. Since 2012, Sony/ATV has administered Jackson's other publishing firm, Mijac, which includes songs written by Jackson himself (and others), and which used to be administered by competitor Warner/Chappell Music.<ref name=\"Michael Jackson's Mijac Music Catalog Moves to Sony/ATV\"></ref>\n\nOn October 8, 2015, it was reported that Sony would sell its 50% stake in Sony/ATV Music Publishing to the Michael Jackson Estate. Contrary to those reports, in October 2015, it was reported that a clause had been triggered in the agreement between Sony and the estate of Michael Jackson, allowing Sony to make a takeover bid for the Sony/ATV stake held by the estate of Michael Jackson, or vice versa. \"Billboard\" felt that Sony acquiring the estate's stake was the most likely outcome, noting the potential revenue the library could bring in regards to licensing for on-demand music streaming services.\n\nOn March 14, 2016, Sony announced that it will acquire the Jackson estate's stake in Sony/ATV in a deal valued at around $750 million, pending regulatory approval. The Jackson estate will retain a 10% stake in EMI Music Publishing, and its ownership of Mijac Music, which holds the rights to Michael Jackson's songs and master recordings. Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton stated that the purchase would \"enable Sony to more quickly adapt to changes in the music publishing business, while at the same time continuing to be an unparalleled leader in the industry and a treasured home for artists and writers.\" The revenue will primarily be used to pay off the estate's $250 million in debt, with the remainder to be placed in trust for Jackson's children. The deal was completed September 30, 2016.\nIn March 2018, media reported that Mubadala Investment Co., an Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund who was one of the buyers of EMI Publishing in 2012, has held talks with Sony and approached other possible buyers to sale its entire stake. Mubadala is reportedly seeking a valuation of at least $4 billion, almost twice what the Sony-led group paid six years ago.\n\nOn May 22, 2018, Sony announced it signed a legally binding memorandum of understanding (\"MOU\") for the sale of the Mubadala consortium's approximately 60% equity interest in EMI Music Publishing to Sony Corporation of America, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sony, for $2,3 billion, based on an enterprise value of $4.75 billion. Assuming the transaction goes through (it is subject to certain closing conditions, including regulatory approvals), Sony will indirectly own approximately 90% of EMI Music Publishing.\n\nIn July 2018, Sony/ATV bought out the Jackson estate's stake in EMI for $287.5 million. Sony has agreed to pay $2.3 billion to acquire EMI, as well as assume EMI’s debt of $1.359 billion. With Sony and Jackson’s share valued at $1.091 billion that gives EMI Music Publishing a valuation of $4.75 billion. Sony has declined to offer any concessions to the European Commission.\n\nUpon his death, Jackson's entertainment attorney, Joel Katz, commented on the singer's work as a businessman. \"Michael Jackson was a perfectionist and his business affairs are worldwide. Many of them are quite ongoing and will be dealt with appropriately.\" Ivan Thornton, a private-wealth adviser who worked with Jackson and his family, also commended the business side of the musician. \"His business mind was fascinating. We'd go to meetings with bankers and Wall Street people and once I explained the language to him, he totally got it. There was no formal education there, but his natural knack was off the charts.\"\n\nIn May 2001, Jackson denied rumours that he was planning to sell the Beatles' song catalogue. Rumours had circulated that the singer was to sell them in order to finance the upkeep of Neverland Ranch and to cover legal bill expenses. The singer announced in a statement, \"I want to clarify a silly rumour – The Beatles catalogue is not for sale, has not been for sale and will never be for sale.\"\n\nFollowing Jackson's death in June 2009, there were reports that Jackson had left the Beatles catalogue to McCartney in his will, having added it just five months before. (Jackson was reportedly expecting to die before McCartney despite being 16 years his junior due to various health problems.) However, it was later revealed that Sony/ATV Music Publishing would keep control of the Beatles' songs.\n\nOn 18 January 2017, McCartney filed a suit in United States district court against Sony/ATV Music Publishing seeking to reclaim ownership of his share of the Lennon–McCartney song catalogue beginning in 2018. Under US copyright law, for works published before 1978 the author can reclaim copyrights assigned to a publisher after 56 years. McCartney and Sony agreed to a confidential settlement in June 2017.\n\nA recent and relevant valuation is tied to Sony's acquisition of Jackson estate's stake in the company, completed on September 30, 2016 for $750 million. This values Sony/ATV at between $2.2 to $2.4 billion (including debt). \n\nBefore the 2016 transaction with Sony, the reported value of Sony/ATV Music Publishing has varied across time and sources. Such valuations are uncertain, as illustrated by their wide variations, given a lack of actual transactions.\n\n\n\n"}

Their precise nature varies by jurisdiction, thus, they might be ordinary companies/corporations owned by a government with or without other shareholders, or they might be a body without shareholders that is controlled by national or sub-national government to the (in some cases minimal) extent provided for in the creating legislation.\n\nBodies described in the English language as \"statutory corporations\" exist in the following countries in accordance with the associated descriptions (where provided).\n\nIn Australia, statutory corporations are created by Acts of state or federal parliaments. Current statutory corporations include Australia Post, Airservices Australia, the Australian Rail Track Corporation and the Australian Egg Corporation. The purpose of their separation from normal government operations is to ensure profitability, and in theory, independence of decision making from the state or national government (to ensure that decisions are made on a commercial basis with less or no political interference.)\n\nAs statutory corporations, their regulatory and business conditions may be significantly different from private-sector companies. An example of this in Australia is the regulatory conditions placed on the national communications company Telstra.\n\nA significant number of the statutory corporations are private commercial operations, a number of which have been privatised, in part or in whole, since the 1980s: these have included the national airline Qantas, Telstra (also previously known as Telecom Australia), and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.\n\nA statutory corporation in Germany is called a \"Körperschaft des öffentlichen Rechts\" (KdöR). An example of a statutory corporation is a \"\", a body involved in the provision of out-patient medical services in a German state. The established Christian churches, the Jewish communities and the public broadcasters in Germany are other prominent examples.\n\nIn Hong Kong, some corporations are incorporated by legislation. An example is the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation, which owns the railway network and was previously also an operator. The MTR Corporation Limited was also such a company, then named as Mass Transit Railway Corporation. Other examples include the former Land Development Corporation, and the Industrial Estates Corporation.\n\nStatutory corporations are public enterprises brought into existence by a Special Act of the Parliament. The Act defines its powers and functions, rules and regulations governing its employees and its relationship with government departments.\n\nThis is a corporate body created by the legislature with defined powers and functions and is financially independent with a clear control over a specified area or a particular type of commercial activity. It is a corporate person and has the capacity of acting in its own name. Statutory corporations therefore have the power of the government and the considerable amount of operating flexibility of private enterprises.\nA few are:\n\nFeatures:\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, a statutory corporation is a body corporate, which is created under a particular Act of the Oireachtas. Some statutory corporations are expected to operate as if they were a commercial company (with or without a subsidy from the Exchequer, depending on whether or not it would make a profit without one). Such bodies do not have shareholders, but are typically boards appointed by a sponsor minister. The provisions of the Companies' Acts do not typically directly apply to such bodies, although their founding legislation may specify similar requirements.\n\nThe statutory corporation format was usually the form most state-sponsored bodies of the Republic of Ireland took until recent years; however, usual policy today is that a private limited company by shares or public limited company incorporated under the Companies' Acts is set up instead, with the relevant Minister holding 100% of the issued share capital. Nonetheless, several prominent statutory corporations continue to exist, such as Radio Telefís Éireann (RTÉ), the Electricity Supply Board (ESB), Bord Gáis Éireann, An Bord Pleanála, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, statutory corporations operate as they do in other parts of the United Kingdom.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the term \"public body\" is the general denomination for administrative divisions within the Dutch state or certain other types of governmental organisations.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a statutory corporation is a corporate body created by statute. It typically has no shareholders and its powers are defined by the Act of Parliament which creates it, and may be modified by later legislation. Such bodies were often created to provide public services, examples including British Railways, the National Coal Board, Post Office Corporation and Transport for London. Other examples include the county councils, the National Assembly for Wales, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), Channel Four Television Corporation, and the Olympic Delivery Authority. The phrase is not used to describe a company which operates as a conventional shareholder-owned company registered under the Companies Acts.\n\n\nN.B. An entity described by the undefined term \"public body\" is not inevitably a \"statutory corporation\".\n\nAt the state level, municipal corporations and counties are often created by legislative acts. Some organizations such as a transit district or special purpose corporations such as a university, are also created by statute. In some states, a city or county can be created by petition of a certain number or percentage of voters or landholders of the affected area, which then causes a municipal corporation to be chartered as a result of compliance with the appropriate law. Corporations to be established for most other purposes are usually just incorporated as any other non-profit corporation, by filing the paperwork with the appropriate agency as part of the formation of the entity.\n\nAt the Federal level, a small number of corporations are created by Congress. Prior to the District of Columbia being granted the ability to issue corporate charters in the late 19th century, corporations operating in the District required a congressional charter. With limited exceptions, most corporations created by Congress are not federally chartered, but are simply created as District of Columbia corporations as a result of the enabling law.\n\nThere are a number of federally chartered corporations that still exist. Some relatively famous ones include the Boy Scouts of America, each of the Federal Reserve Banks, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The basic advantage for being federally chartered is that no other corporation anywhere in the United States is allowed to have the same name.\n\n"}

{"id": "23892117", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23892117", "title": "Thou shalt not kill", "text": "Thou shalt not kill\n\nThou shalt not kill (LXX; ), You shall not murder (Hebrew: ') or You shall not kill\"' (KJV), is a moral imperative included as one of the Ten Commandments in the Torah.\n\nThe imperative to not kill is in the context of \"unlawful\" killing resulting in bloodguilt.\n\nThe Hebrew verb (\"r-ṣ-ḥ\", also transliterated \"retzach, ratzákh, ratsakh\" etc.) is the word in the original text that is translated as \"murder\" or \"kill\", but it has a wider range of meanings, generally describing destructive activity, including meanings \"to break, to dash to pieces\" as well as \"to slay, kill, murder\".\n\nAccording to the Priestly Code of the Book of Numbers, killing anyone outside the context of war with a weapon, or in unarmed combat, is considered \"retzach\", but if the killing is accidental, the accused must flee to one of the cities of refuge—and remain in that city until the high priest dies, or the “revenger of blood” can kill the accused with no legal repercussions. The Bible never uses the word \"retzach\" in conjunction with war.\n\nThe act of slaying itself, regardless of questions of bloodguilt, is expressed with the verb \"n-k-h\" \"to strike, smite, hit, beat, slay, kill\". This verb is used of both an Egyptian slaying an Israelite slave and of Moses slaying the Egyptian in retaliation in . The Covenant Code and Holiness Code both prescribe the death penalty for people that commit \"n-k-h\".\n\nThe commandment against murder can be viewed as a legal issue governing human relationships, noting that the first four commandments relate strongly to man's duty to God and that the latter six commandments describe duties toward humans. The commandment against murder can also be viewed as based in respect for God himself. Since man is made in God's image, the shedding of innocent blood is viewed as a direct offense against God. \"The voice of your brother's blood is crying to me from the ground. And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.\" (ESV)\n\nThe Genesis narrative also portrays the prohibition of shedding innocent blood as an important aspect of God's covenant with Noah.\nThe Torah portrays murder as a capital crime and describes a number of details in the moral understanding and legal implementation of consequences. The Priestly Code allowed the victim's next of kin (\"avenger of blood\") exact retribution on the suspect; but the accused could seek sanctuary in a \"city of refuge\". The right of the \"avenger of blood\" to such revenge ceased, upon the death of the person who was the Jewish High Priest at the time of the crime\n\nAnother verb meaning \"to kill, slay, murder, destroy, ruin\" is \"h-r-g\", used of Cain slaying Abel in Genesis 4:8. When Cain is driven into exile, complaining that \"every one that findeth me shall slay me\" in , he again uses this verb (\"h-r-g\"). Eliezer Segal observes that the Septuagint uses the term \"harag\", and that Augustine of Hippo recognized that this did not extend to wars or capital punishment. Most subsequent translations follow Jerome's Vulgate. While Jerome had access to Jewish scholars, \"even the Jewish translators were not unanimous in maintaining a consistent distinctions between the various Hebrew roots.\" Jerome's choice of the word \"occidere\" (to kill) reflects the broader range of meanings.\n\nIn a more modern analysis, Wilma Ann Bailey also finds a broader application of the word \"retzach\".\n\nThe Torah and Hebrew Bible made clear distinctions between the shedding of innocent blood versus killing as the due consequence of a crime. A number of sins were considered to be worthy of the death penalty including murder, incest, bearing false witness on a capital charge, adultery, idolatry, bestiality, human sacrifice to pagan gods, cursing a parent, fortune-telling, and other sins.\n\nFor example, the Exodus narrative describes the people as having turned to idolatry with the golden calf while Moses was on the mountain receiving the law from God. When Moses came down, he commanded the Levites to take up the sword against their brothers and companions and neighbors. The Levites obeyed and killed about three thousand men who had sinned in worship of the golden calf. As a result, Moses said that the Levites had received a blessing that day at the cost of son and brother. On a separate occasion, a blasphemer was stoned to death because he blasphemed the name of the Lord (Yahweh) with a curse.\n\nThe Hebrew Bible has many other examples of sinners being put to death as due consequence for crimes. Achan is put to death by Joshua because he caused defeat of Israel’s army by taking some of the plunder and hiding it in his tent. David ordered that an Amalekite be put to death because he claimed to have killed King Saul. Following the advice of his father, Solomon ordered that Joab be killed:\nThe biblical refrain for those justly executed as due punishment for crimes is that \"their blood will be on their own heads.\" This expresses the idea that those guilty of certain actions have brought the shedding of blood upon themselves, and those carrying out due punishment do not bear bloodguilt.\n\nThe ancient Hebrew texts make a distinction between the moral and legal prohibition of shedding of innocent blood and killing in battle. Rabbi Marc Gellman explains the distinction between \"harag\" (killing) and \"ratzah\" (murder) and notes the different moral connotations. \"...there is wide moral agreement (not complete agreement) that some forms of killing are morally just, and killing an enemy combatant during wartime is one of them.\" For example, the Torah prohibits murder, but sanctions killing in legitimate battle. The Bible often praises the exploits of soldiers against enemies in legitimate battle. One of David’s mighty men is credited with killing eight hundred men with the spear, and Abishai is credited with killing three hundred men.\n\nThe 613 Mitzvot extend the notion of lawful killing to the nations that inhabited the Promised Land, commanding to exterminate them completely.\nDeuteronomy 20:10-18 establishes rules on killing civilians in warfare:\n\nAs described in the Torah, the ancient understanding of the prohibition of murder made an exception for legitimate self-defense. A home defender who struck and killed a thief caught in the act of breaking in at night was not guilty of bloodshed. \"If a thief is caught breaking in and is struck so that he dies, the defender is not guilty of bloodshed; but if it happens after sunrise, he is guilty of bloodshed.\"\n\nJewish law views the shedding of innocent blood very seriously, and lists murder as one of three sins (along with idolatry and sexual immorality) that fall under the category of yehareg ve'al ya'avor, meaning \"One should let himself be killed rather than violate it.\" Jewish law enumerates 613 Mitzvot, or commandments, including prohibition of murder and a number of other commandments related to the preserving of human life and administration of justice in cases of shedding of innocent blood.\n\nLife is considered very precious, even sacred by Jewish teaching. The Talmud cites the prohibition of shedding innocent blood in Genesis 9:6 as the reason why the death penalty should be carried out against non-Jews as well as Jews, and while faithful Jews are required to obey 613 Mitzvot, gentiles are only obliged to obey the seven Noahide laws, which include the prohibition of murder and establishment of a justice system to administer law honestly. Rabbi Dr. Azriel Rosenfeld offers a representative modern summary of Jewish teaching regarding the command not to murder.\n\nIn the Talmud, Genesis 9:5 is interpreted as a prohibition against killing oneself, and Genesis 9:6 is \"cited in support for the prohibition of abortion.\"\n\nAccording to the \"Mishnah\" (older part of the \"Talmud\"), it is said of Hillel the Elder that he saw a skull that was floating on top of the water and he said (to it): \"Since you drowned [others, others] drowned you. And in the end, those that drowned you will be drowned.\" From Rabbi Tarfon and Rabbi Akiva it is stated in the \"Mishnah\": \"If we were on the \"Sanhedrin\", nobody would have ever been executed.\"\n\nThe New Testament is in agreement that murder is a grave moral evil, and maintains the Old Testament view of bloodguilt. Jesus himself repeats and expands upon the commandment, \"Do not murder.\" The New Testament depicts Jesus as explaining that murder, as well as other sins, comes from the heart.\nThe New Testament acknowledges the just and proper role of civil government in maintaining justice and punishing evildoers, even to the point of \"bearing the sword.\" One criminal on the cross contrasts his death as due punishment with Jesus’ death as an innocent man. When Jesus appeared before Pilate, both Pilate and the crowd recognize the principles of bloodguilt. There is no indication in the New Testament that it is unjust, immoral, or inappropriate for secular civil governments to execute those guilty of shedding innocent blood.\n\nLike the Old Testament, the New Testament seems to depict the lawful use of force by soldiers in legitimate battles as justified. The profession of soldier is used as a metaphor by Paul exhorting the Ephesians to \"put on the full armor of God.\" Cornelius, the Roman centurion, is portrayed as a righteous and God-fearing man. Jesus praises the faith of a Roman centurion on the occasion of healing the centurion’s servant, and states that he has not found such great faith even in Israel. When John the Baptist was preaching repentance and baptizing penitent sinners in the Jordan river, soldiers came to John and asked for specific instructions regarding their repentance. John the Baptist did not demand that the soldiers renounce their profession, instead he exhorted them to be content with their pay.\n\nJesus was not condoning violence as the very next verse confirms it was to satisfy the prophecy of Isaiah 53 when he told his disciples to buy a sword if they do not have one, \"now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.\" Jesus was quick to correct his servant for the improper use of the sword in cutting off the ear of the high-priest’s servant.\n\nIn John 8:7 Jesus replied to the question of capital punishment because of adultery to \"let him who is without sin cast the first stone\" - and no one did.\n\nThis commandment demands respect for human life and is more accurately translated as \"thou shalt not murder.\" Killing may, under limited circumstances, be justified within Catholicism. The basis of all Catholic teaching about the fifth commandment is the \"sanctity of life\", which is often contrasted with the \"quality of life\" to some extent. The Church is actively involved in the public debates over abortion, capital punishment and euthanasia, and encourages believers to support legislation and politicians it describes as pro-life.\n\nAccording to the \"Catechism of the Catholic Church\":\nThe \"Catechism\" states that abortion is a grave moral evil because the act takes an innocent human life: human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception. From the first moment of his existence, \"a human being must be recognized as having the rights of a person - among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life.\"\n\nLegitimate defense is depicted as justifiable, even if the defender deals his aggressor a lethal blow. However, a person should not use more force than necessary to repel an attack. The legitimate defense of persons and societies should not be considered as an exception to the prohibition of murdering the innocent: the preservation of innocent life is seen as the intended outcome. Injury or death to the aggressor is not the intended outcome, it is the unfortunate consequence of using necessary force to repel an imminent threat.\n\nLegitimate defense can be not only a right but a grave duty for one who is responsible for the lives of others. The Catechism says: \"The defense of the common good requires that an unjust aggressor be rendered unable to cause harm. For this reason, those who legitimately hold authority also have the right to use arms to repel aggressors against the civil community entrusted to their responsibility.\"\n\nThe \"Catechism\" teaches that legitimate public authority has the right and duty to punish criminals proportionally to the gravity of the offense to safeguard the public good. Nonlethal means are preferred, if these are sufficient to defend and protect people’s safety. Recourse to the death penalty was not excluded in the past. In August 2018 the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith with the approval of Pope Francis changed paragraph 2267 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church and declared that the death penalty is always regarded as inadmissible. An Ohio prosecutor publicly declared that he disagrees with that, while Catholic US scholars drafted an appeal against the change and declared it \"scandalous\". \n\nIn February 2016 Pope Francis called for the suspension of the death penalty for the duration of the Holy Year \"because modern means existed to 'efficiently repress crime without definitively denying the person who committed it the possibility of rehabilitating themselves.\"\n\nCatholic teaching strictly prohibits euthanasia and suicide as violations of the commandment, \"You shall not kill.\" Recognizing life and health as precious gifts from God, adherents are encouraged to avoid excess of food, tobacco, alcohol, and medications. Endangering others with excesses speed or drunkenness on the roadway incurs grave guilt. The use of drugs, except on strictly therapeutic grounds is a grave offense. Clandestine production and trafficking in drugs constitute \"direct co-operation in evil.\" \n\nThe Catholic Catechism urges prayer for the avoidance of war. All citizens and governments are obliged to work toward the avoidance of war. However, it recognizes that governments cannot be denied the lawful right to self-defense, once all peace efforts have failed. The use of legitimate defense by a military force is considered grave and therefore subject to rigorous considerations of moral legitimacy. Elements of just war theory are explicitly enumerated in the Catechism:\n\nMartin Luther summarized the commandment against shedding innocent blood as grounded in the fear and love of God, and as having both positive and negative aspects: negative in that we must neither harm nor hurt our neighbor’s body; positive in that we must help our neighbor and care for him when he is ill.\nIn a more detailed teaching, Martin Luther explains that God and government are not constrained by the commandment not to kill, but that God has delegated his authority in punishing evildoers to the government. The prohibition of killing is forbidden to the individual in his relation to anyone else, and not to the government.\n\nIn The Institutes of the Christian Religion, John Calvin viewed the purport of this commandment as the safety of all being entrusted to each person. All violence and injustice, and every kind of harm from which our neighbor’s body suffers is thereby prohibited. Christians are therefore required to faithfully perform that which is within their power to defend the life of their neighbor, be vigilant in warding off harm, and assist in removing danger when it comes.Calvin asserts that the same rule must also be applied in regulating the mind against anger, arguing that since God sees the heart and mind, the commandment against shedding innocent blood also prohibits murder of the heart and requires a sincere desire to preserve our brother’s life. The hand does not commit the murder unless it is conceived by the mind under the influence of wrath and hatred. According to Calvin, where wrath and hatred dwell, there is an inclination to do mischief, quoting the Bible, \"whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer\"(1 John 3:15) and \"whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgement\" (Gospel of Matthew 5:22).\n\nJohn Calvin also makes a case that the command against shedding blood is founded both in the creation of man in the image of God and in the need for a man to cherish his own flesh.\n\nMatthew Henry considered the commandment against killing to apply to both one’s own life as well as the life of one’s neighbor and considered it to apply not only to causing of death but also to prohibit any thing unjustly hurtful to or injurious to the health, ease, and life of one’s own body or the body of any other person. He also ties the commandment against bloodshed back to the command to Noah, and he sees it as a command applying to the individual against his neighbor, but not against killing in lawful war, for one’s own necessary defense, or against the government instituting due punishments for criminal offenses. He portrays lying in wait for the blood of the innocent as a grave offense against human dignity as one of the fundamental laws of nature.\n\n\n\"The Jewish Study Bible, Tanakh Translation.\" 2004.

{"id": "9762159", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9762159", "title": "Training contract", "text": "Training contract\n\nA training contract is a compulsory period of practical training in a law firm for law graduates before they can qualify as a solicitor in the United Kingdom (UK), the Republic of Ireland, Australia or Hong Kong, or as an advocate and solicitor in Singapore. During the training period, the participant is known as a trainee solicitor or trainee lawyer (in Singapore).\n\nA training contract can apply to any profession. In some 21st-century contracts, a small number of contracts are secured by an Agency who represent many training professionals. Otherwise training contracts can be negotiated locally.\n\nIn the UK a full-time training contract is normally for two years, and applicants must have first completed the Legal Practice Course. Trainee solicitors and training contracts were formerly known as articled clerks and articles of clerkship, respectively. In the UK, the barrister's equivalent is a twelve-month pupillage under a pupilmaster, in barristers' chambers.\n\nTo obtain a training contract (since 1st July 2014 a training contract was replaced by 'a period of recognised training'), a graduate must apply for an opening for such position at a law firm or in-house counsel, usually a year or two in advance of the start of planned employment. Many law firms offer vacation schemes (one- or two-week internships) as a lead-in to a training contract. The vacations schemes usually involve real work in one of the firm's departments, various assessment exercises and an interview. Vacation schemes students are normally paid.\n\nA concern of the profession is that each year the number of applicants exceeds the number of contracts available. Graduates unable to obtain a training contract will have accrued sizeable debts with no guarantee of being able to qualify as a lawyer. In years past, it was common for aspiring lawyers to pay law firms to train them (a practice also common in other professions in the past, including officer positions in the Royal Navy).\n\nFor a legal executive, who normally does not hold a law degree, a training contract is not normally required to qualify as a solicitor. They typically advance toward qualification by passing exams administered by the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives (CILEx), while working under the supervision of a solicitor.\n\nIn Singapore, a Practice Training Contract spans 6 months, and is normally undertaken after the applicant, who must be a \"qualified person\" under local legislation relating to the legal profession, has attended a 5-month practical law course, called the \"Preparatory Course leading to Part B of the Singapore Bar Examinations\" (or \"Part B Course\"), and has passed \"Part B of the Singapore Bar Examinations\" (or \"Part B\"), although the reverse order is permissible.\n\nA Practice Training Contract is a formal arrangement between a qualified person and a law practice for supervised training in relation to practicing law in Singapore. A qualified lawyer of at least 5 to 7 years' standing, known as a supervising solicitor, is responsible for the supervision of the practice trainee for the duration of the contract.\n\nUpon the satisfactory completion of both the Practice Training Contract and Part B, the qualified person is, subject to certain other requirements, eligible to be admitted to practice law as an Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore (i.e. \"called to the Singapore Bar\").\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2029145", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2029145", "title": "United States v. Booker", "text": "United States v. Booker\n\nUnited States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), is a United States Supreme Court decision on criminals' sentences. The Court ruled that the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial requires that other than a prior conviction, only facts admitted by a defendant or proved beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury may be used to calculate a sentence exceeding the prescribed statutory maximum sentence, whether the defendant has pleaded guilty or been convicted at trial. The maximum sentence that a judge may impose is based upon the facts admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nIn its majority decision, the Court struck down the provision of the federal sentencing statute that required federal district judges to impose a sentence within the Federal Guidelines range, along with the provision that deprived federal appeals courts of the power to review sentences imposed outside the range. The Court instructed federal district judges to impose a sentence with reference to a wider range of sentencing factors set forth in the federal sentencing statute, and it directed federal appeals courts to review criminal sentences for \"reasonableness,\" which the Court left undefined.\n\nThe ruling was the direct consequence of the Court's ruling six months earlier in \"Blakely v. Washington\", in which the Court had imposed the same requirement on a guidelines sentencing scheme employed in Washington State. \"Blakely\" arose out of \"Apprendi v. New Jersey\" in which the Court held that except for a prior conviction, any fact that increases the defendant's punishment above the statutory maximum punishment must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nIn 2003, Freddie Joe Booker was arrested after police officers found 92.5 grams of crack cocaine in his duffel bag. He later gave a written statement to the police that admitted to selling an additional 566 grams of crack cocaine. In 2003, a jury in the US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin found Booker guilty of possessing with intent to distribute at least 50 grams of cocaine base. Federal law provided for a statutory sentence of ten years to life in prison.\n\nAt sentencing, the judge found by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant (1) distributed 566 grams over and above the 100 grams that the jury had to have found and (2) had obstructed justice. Under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, that increased the defendant's base offense level from 32 to 36 (U.S.S.G. §§ 2D1.1(c)(2),(4)). The enhancement for the drug possession and obstruction of justice (U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1) made Booker's sentencing range of 30 years to life; the judge sentenced Booker to the minimum.\n\nBooker appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, claiming the sentencing guidelines violated his Sixth Amendment rights since the judge was able to find facts absent the findings of the jury, other than his criminal history, to determine his sentencing range. The Seventh Circuit affirmed Booker's conviction but found the application of the Guidelines violated the Sixth Amendment, as interpreted in \"Blakely\", and so reversed Booker's sentence. The Government appealed the Seventh Circuit's ruling to the Supreme Court.\n\nNarcotics agents discovered 2.5 kilograms of cocaine and 281.6 grams of cocaine base in Ducan Fanfan's vehicle and arrested him. A jury in the US District Court for the District of Maine found that Fanfan had conspired to distribute and to possess with the intent to distribute at least 500 grams of cocaine, in violation of , and 841(b)(1)(B)(ii). The maximum sentence for Fanfan under the Federal Guidelines, without any additional findings, was 78 months in prison.\n\nAt sentencing, the judge, by a preponderance of the evidence, determined that Fanfan was responsible for 2.5 kilograms of cocaine powder and 261.6 grams of crack and was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in the criminal activity. That would have resulted 188 to 235 months sentence under the Guidelines, which was a 10-year increase in the sentencing range from what the jury had found. The Supreme Court had issued \"Blakely\" four days before the judge imposed Fanfan's sentence. The sentencing judge, believing that \"Blakely\" had implications on federal judges increasing sentences on facts not found by juries, imposed the maximum sentence, 78 months, based on the jury's verdict. The government asked the judge to correct Fanfan’s sentence, which was denied.\n\nThe Government filed a notice of appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit and a petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court in the Fanfan case. Because of the importance of the case, the Supreme Court granted the petition as well as a similar petition filed by the government in Booker’s case, following the Seventh Circuit's ruling in favor of Booker. The Government asked the Court to determine whether \"Apprendi\" applied to the Sentencing Guidelines and which of the Guidelines were constitutional.\n\nThe decision of the Supreme Court was announced by two different groups of Justices. Justice Stevens wrote the majority opinion answering the question of whether the application of the Guidelines in these two cases violated the Sixth Amendment as articulated in the \"Apprendi\" line of cases. Justice Breyer wrote the majority opinion answering the question of how to remedy the Sixth Amendment violation identified by the Court.\n\nAs applied to modern sentencing schemes, the Sixth Amendment demands that, other than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the defendant's punishment above the statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The \"statutory maximum\" is the greatest sentence the judge can impose based solely on the jury's fact finding. In a guidelines sentencing scheme that requires judges to impose a sentence within the guideline range, the jury-trial and reasonable-doubt requirements apply to the determination of any fact that exposes the defendant to punishment above the guideline range.\n\nThe Federal Sentencing Guidelines, like the Washington sentencing guidelines discussed in \"Blakely\", were mandatory; sentencing judges were required to impose sentences within the range dictated by the Guidelines. In this sense, the decision in \"Blakely\" dictated the constitutional holding that the rule of \"Apprendi\", as construed in \"Blakely\", applies to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe Government made three principal arguments against applying \"Blakely\" to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, all of which the Court rejected:\n\n1. \"Commission vs. Legislature\"\n\nThe Federal Sentencing Guidelines were promulgated by a sentencing commission; the Washington sentencing guidelines at issue in \"Blakely\", by contrast, were enacted by that state's legislature. That distinction, the Court said, \"lacked constitutional significance,\" because regardless of the body that set the rules, the rules required sentencing judges to increase sentences on the basis of particular facts not submitted to the jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. \"Regardless of whether the legal basis of the accusation [against the defendant] is in a statute or in guidelines promulgated by an independent commission, the principles behind the jury trial right are equally applicable\" to each.\n\n2. \"Stare decisis\"\n\nThe Government identified four recent cases that, it argued, precluded the Court from applying \"Blakely\" to the Guidelines under the principles of \"stare decisis\". First, \"United States v. Dunnigan\", , held that the Guidelines provision that provided for an enhanced sentence if the defendant committed perjury during the trial did not violate the defendant's Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. In \"Dunnigan\", the Court had no occasion to consider whether the jury-trial right applied to that particular provision. Furthermore, although a sentence based on such an enhancement had the potential to exceed the statutory maximum, this did not mean that the judge had to impose such a sentence. \"Thus, while the reach of \"Dunnigan\" may be limited, we need not overrule it.\"\n\nNext, \"Witte v. United States\", , in which the Court held conduct that supported an enhancement in a prior case did not prevent a separate criminal prosecution for the same conduct, did not prevent applying \"Blakely\" to the Guidelines. This was so because, ultimately, the conduct in the two respective cases was subject to two different burdens of proof. The Court considered the converse of the \"Witte\" rule in \"United States v. Watts\", , where it held that conduct of which the defendant had been acquitted could nevertheless support a sentence enhancement under the Guidelines. In neither case had the Court considered whether the sentence enhancements in question were subject to the jury-trial requirement. \"The issue we confront today simply was not presented.\"\n\nFinally, \"Edwards v. United States\", , in which the Court allowed a sentence for a drug conspiracy involving both powder and crack cocaine to rest on both drugs in the face of a general verdict not specifying whether the jury believed the conspiracy involved either powder cocaine or crack cocaine or both, did not prevent the Court from applying \"Blakely\" to the Guidelines. In \"Edwards\", the defendants could not have argued that the powder and crack cocaine were not part of the same overall conspiracy; hence, the Court's ruling in that case was not inconsistent with applying \"Blakely\" to the Guidelines.\n\n3. \"Separation of Powers\"\n\nThe Government argued that applying the jury-trial requirement to sentencing enhancements promulgated by a commission would transform those enhancements into a criminal code, resulting in an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the judicial branch. In \"Mistretta v. United States\", the Court had upheld the delegation of such legislative power to a body in the judicial branch, reasoning that the judicial branch had the power to exercise other quasi-legislative functions such as proposing rules of evidence and civil procedure for use in the federal courts. The United States Sentencing Commission was not performing an adjudicatory function; rather, it was exercising a policy-making power appropriate for judicial officers and uniquely within their expertise. This reasoning did not preclude applying \"Blakely\" to the Guidelines.\n\nThus, the Court ruled that the holding in \"Blakely\" applied to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.\n\nThe Court next confronted the question of a remedy for the constitutional violation. A different majority of the Court concluded that 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b) — the provision of the federal sentencing statute that required district courts to impose a sentence within the Guidelines range — was \"incompatible\" with the constitutional holding and therefore had to be \"severed and excised\" from the statute. Likewise, 18 U.S.C. § 3742(e), the provision that governed the handling of appeals from sentences, also had to be severed and excised, because that provision was inextricably linked with the provision that made the Guidelines mandatory. The result of severing and excising these two provisions was to make the Guidelines \"effectively advisory,\" such that district courts could, after considering the Guidelines range, tailor a sentence that reflected the broader range of concerns set forth in the federal sentencing statute.\n\nThe Court evaluated two possible remedies in light of Congress's intent in enacting the Guidelines system. The first option, and the one preferred by the Justices who dissented from the remedial holding, \"would engraft onto the existing system today's Sixth Amendment 'jury trial' requirement.\" The second, the one the Court ultimately adopted, made the Guidelines advisory while at the same time \"maintaining a strong connection between the sentence imposed and the offender's real conduct — a connection important to the increased uniformity of sentencing that Congress intended its Guidelines system to achieve.\" Although both remedies would \"significantly alter the system that Congress designed,\" the remedial majority observed that it was not possible to \"maintain the judicial factfinding that Congress thought would underpin the mandatory Guidelines system\" in light of the jury factfinding requirement the constitutional majority had applied to that system.\n\n\"Why the Jury Factfinding Requirement Is Not Compatible with the Guidelines Scheme\"\n\nSeveral considerations persuaded the Court that Congress would not have enacted the Guidelines system and made it mandatory for federal district judges to apply if it had known that a jury factfinding requirement would apply to it. First, the text of the sentencing statute required \"the court\" to consider \"the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant\" when imposing sentence. In context, this meant \"the judge sitting alone\" instead of \"the judge together with the jury.\" When it was debating the Guidelines, Congress had intended for the judge to weigh the factors bearing on a defendant's sentence by himself.\n\nSecond, \"Congress's basic statutory goal — a system that diminishes sentencing disparity — depends for its success upon judicial efforts to determine, and to base punishment upon, the \"real conduct\" that underlies the crime of conviction.\" Many federal crimes are defined so broadly as to encompass a vast array of underlying conduct. And other federal crimes, like robbery, can be committed in a variety of different ways. Judges typically relied on presentence reports, which set forth the relevant conduct and offender characteristics, to assist them in determining what an appropriate sentence was. Congress anticipated that, under the Guidelines, this practice would continue, and this expectation supported the Court's holdings in \"Witte\" and \"Watts\". By contrast, imposing the jury factfinding requirement onto the Guidelines would \"destroy the system\" by \"prevent[ing] a judge from relying on a presentence report for factual information, relevant to sentencing, uncovered after the trial,\" because such facts would necessarily not have been submitted to the jury during the course of the trial. This, in turn, would \"weaken the tie between a sentence and an offender's real conduct.\"\n\nImagine that both Smith and Jones violate the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a), which forbids obstructing, delaying, or affecting commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce by extortion. Smith threatens to injure a co-worker if the co-worker does not advance him a few dollars from the interstate company's till. Jones threatens to injure a co-worker unless the co-worker advances him a few thousand dollars from the company's accounts, and reinforces this threat by \"making certain that the co-worker's family is aware of the threat, by arranging deliveries of various dead animals to the co-worker's home to show that he is serious, and so forth.\" Both Smith and Jones, although they violated the same statute, created different harms as a result of their actions. Under the Guidelines, their sentences would be different. If the jury factfinding requirement were merely grafted onto the Guidelines scheme, unless prosecutors \"decide to charge more than the elements of the crime,\" the judge would have to impose similar punishments.\n\nImagine next that two former felons, Johnson and Jackson, each threatened a bank teller with a gun, made off with $50,000, and injured an innocent bystander while fleeing the bank. Suppose Johnson was charged with illegal possession of a firearm under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g), and Jackson was charged with bank robbery under 18 U.S.C. § 2113(a). The Guidelines would have allowed a judge to impose similar sentences on both Johnson and Jackson, despite their being charged with different crimes. Requiring the sentence-enhancing facts to be submitted to a jury undermines the ability of the Guidelines to achieve their goal of sentence uniformity, meaning uniformity of sentences imposed for the same real conduct, not for violations of the same statute.\n\nFurthermore, imposing the jury-factfinding requirement onto the Guidelines would prove more complex than Congress could have intended. Would the sentence enhancements have to be charged in the indictment? How could a defendant defend against specific enhancements, such as that he used a gun during the crime, while simultaneously denying his guilt entirely? The fact that the vast majority of criminal cases are resolved through plea bargains would not simplify things. Instead, it would complicate them by increasing the likelihood that any agreed-upon sentence reflects more the skill of defense counsel and the prosecutor's policies than the real conduct underlying the offense.\n\nSuch a system \"would have particularly troubling consequences with respect to prosecutorial power.\" Because a prosecutor would control not only the charge to bring against the defendant but also the sentence enhancement, he would necessarily have the \"power to decide, based on relevant information about the offense and the offender, which defendants merit heavier punishments.\"\n\nCongress also would not have intended to craft a system that makes it more difficult to ratchet sentences upward than downward. Yet imposing the jury-factfinding requirement on the Guidelines would have precisely that effect. For all these reasons, the Court concluded that Congress would not have enacted the Guidelines as it did if it had known that many of the various sentence-enhancing factors would be subject to a jury-trial requirement.\n\n\"Which Parts of the Statute Should Be Excised?\"\n\nIn order to eliminate the constitutional violation the Court had identified and at the same time tailor the federal sentencing statutes more closely to Congressional intent, the Court struck out 18 U.S.C. § 3553(b)(1), the provision of the sentencing statute that made it mandatory for district courts to impose sentences according to the Guidelines. The rest of the sentencing statute \"functioned independently.\" It required district judges to \"consider\" the Guidelines sentencing range established for the applicable category of offense committed by the applicable category of defendant in order to impose a sentence that reflects the seriousness of the offense, promotes respect for the law, provides for adequate deterrence, protects the public, and provides the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care.\n\nBecause the Court had struck out § 3553(b)(1), it also had to strike out 18 U.S.C. § 3742(e), the provision governing the standard for reviewing sentences on appeal. This did not impose an unnecessary obstacle for handling appeals of sentences, for \"a statute that does not \"explicitly\" set forth a standard of review may do so \"implicitly\".\" Before the Court's decision in \"Booker\", § 3742(e) had instructed appellate courts to determine whether a sentence was \"unreasonable\" with respect to the Guidelines range. After \"Booker\", the Court read the remaining provisions of the sentencing appeal statute to instruct appellate courts to determine whether sentences were \"unreasonable\" with respect to all the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) — the statute spelling out which factors district courts were required to consider in fashioning a sentence in the first instance. Though the Justices who dissented from the remedial holding called this standard unworkable, the Court reasoned that a standard of \"reasonableness\" was familiar from other areas of the law. Together with the Sentencing Commission, which would still collect data about criminal sentencing, the courts of appeals together are able to maintain uniformity of criminal sentences. Furthermore, if Congress was unsatisfied with this arrangement, it was free to amend the sentencing laws.\n\nJustice Stevens pointed out that it was possible to avoid the Sixth Amendment violation in Booker's case without making any changes to the Guidelines at all. Solely on the statute of conviction, the maximum Guidelines sentence Booker could have received was 262 months. If the prosecution had submitted the quantity of drugs to the jury, the range would have increased to between 324 and 405 months. Booker ultimately received a sentence of 360 months, one within the increased sentencing range and one which the sentencing judge could have imposed after evaluating Booker's criminal history and whether he had obstructed justice. \"Because the Guidelines as written possess the virtue of combining a mandatory determination of sentencing ranges and discretionary decisions within those ranges, they allow ample latitude for judicial factfinding that does not even arguably raise any Sixth Amendment issue.\"\n\nBut Stevens's principal objection was that the Court had crafted a new kind of severability analysis. He started with the premise that all legislative enactments are presumed to be valid, and may only be struck down in their entirety if the law is unconstitutional in \"all or nearly all of its applications,\" or if the invalid provision cannot be severed from the remainder of the statute. Neither of those conditions applied to the federal sentencing laws, Stevens observed, and so there was no need to adopt a third method of curing constitutional violations. After all, according to the Sentencing Commission, 45% of criminal sentences involve no enhancements whatsoever, and not all of the rest would actually implicate a defendant's Sixth Amendment rights. Furthermore, defendants may waive their jury-trial rights, and so it follows that they may also waive their \"Blakely\" rights in appropriate situations.\n\nThese two observations led Stevens to the conclusion that only a \"tiny portion\" of criminal sentences imposed under the mandatory Guidelines scheme would actually implicate the \"Blakely\" rule. In those cases, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges could cope. Indeed, after \"Blakely\" was decided, the Department of Justice instructed prosecutors to include drug quantity allegations in the indictment. Also, in many cases, Guidelines ranges overlap, and there would be no \"Blakely\" problem if the judge imposed a sentence within that overlapping range and based that sentence solely on judicial factfinding. In light of these valid applications of mandatory Guidelines (constrained by \"Blakely\"), Stevens saw no plausible way to say that the sentencing statute was unconstitutional in nearly all of its applications.\n\nStevens further envisioned no difficulty in applying \"Blakely\" to the Guidelines. The word \"court\" could just as easily refer to the judge and jury together as it could to the judge alone. Congress must presumably legislate within constitutional limitations, after all, and it was not plain from the language of the statute that this alternative interpretation was incompatible. Stevens disputed that applying \"Blakely\" to the Guidelines would frustrate the goal of achieving uniformity in sentences based on real conduct, because judges retained discretion to impose sentences within prescribed ranges; if defendants pleaded guilty and waived their \"Blakely\" rights, the range within which the judge could exercise his discretion would necessarily increase. Given the fact-based nature of certain sentence enhancements under the Guidelines — drug quantity, firearm enhancements, and extent of injury or loss to the victim — there was no reason juries could not make those determinations. In complicated cases, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges together could be trusted to craft workable solutions. To the extent prosecutors overstep their charging authority, judges retain the ability to reject unsatisfactory plea agreements. In light of these objections, Stevens disputed that Congress would have preferred the majority's remedy to a solution of its own devising.\n\nJustice Breyer reiterated his disagreement with the \"Apprendi\" rule, and then identified specific reasons not to apply the \"Blakely\" holding to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. The facts used to determine a defendant's sentence had historically been solely within a judge's purview, and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines should be treated no differently. Creating a system that frustrated the goal of increased sentencing uniformity hardly seemed fair to defendants or to the public at large. The fact that the Guidelines were administrative rules rather than statutes also was significant to Breyer. And to the extent that the Guidelines did not adequately take into account an aggravating or mitigating circumstance, a judge was free to depart from the Guidelines range. Thus, the defendant had every expectation that, despite the Guidelines, he might receive a sentence at or near the \"statutory\" maximum rather than at the top end of the Guidelines range.\n\nJustice Scalia took issue with the Court's inferring a \"reasonableness\" standard of appellate review of sentences from the remainder of a statute from which it had excised the express statement that sentences should be reviewed for \"reasonableness.\" Traditionally, sentencing discretion was not reviewable on appeal. When the Guidelines were enacted, appellate review was limited to discrete cases delineated by statute; appellate review was not plenary. According to the text of the statute, the \"power to review a sentence for reasonableness arises only when the sentencing court has departed from the applicable guideline range.\" The situation here was not that the statute did not \"explicitly\" set forth a standard of review, but rather that the statute did explicitly set forth such a standard, but then excised from the statute the provision that established the standard. Was it proper for the Court to \"look for some congressional 'implication' of a \"different\" standard of review in the remnants of the statute that the Court has left standing? Only in Wonderland.\"\n\nFurthermore, it was not as easy for the courts to apply the \"reasonableness\" standard in the context of appellate review of sentences as the majority would have liked. First, there was no history of applying that standard under the Guidelines regime. Second, under the majority's holding that standard would apply across the board to all sentence appeals, including those that involved no legal error. \"The worst feature of the scheme is that no one knows — and perhaps no one is meant to know — how advisory Guidelines and 'unreasonableness' review will function in practice.\"\n\nThe lower courts had to revisit Booker's sentencing in light of the Supreme Court decision. He was resentenced by the same judge to the same 30-year sentence (longer than the 21-year sentence the judge could have imposed if the guidelines not been made advisory); however, retroactive changes in crack cocaine guidelines meant that Booker's sentence has been reduced slightly by a federal judge (from 30 to 27 years), and he has a projected release date of 20 June 2024.\n\nFanfan was resentenced by the US District judge from 78 months to 210 months in prison. The new sentence was upheld on appeal by the US Court of Appeals. His sentence was later reduced by the new federal sentencing guidelines for crack cocaine offenses. He has a projected release date of 13 June 2015.\n\nThe decision has been criticized for fear that defendants and prosecutors will suffer from greater uncertainty and that some plea agreements will be entered into or rejected because of mistaken beliefs on the sentences that the judge will impose if the case is taken to trial or settled with a guilty plea.\n\n\n"}
