The ultimatum forced the retreat of Portuguese military forces from areas which had been claimed by Portugal on the basis of historical discovery and recent exploration, but which the United Kingdom claimed on the basis of effective occupation. Portugal had attempted to claim a large area of land between its colonies of Mozambique and Angola including most of present-day Zimbabwe and Zambia and a large part of Malawi, which had been included in Portugal's \"Rose-coloured Map\".\n\nIt has sometimes been claimed that the British government's objections arose because the Portuguese claims clashed with its aspirations to create a Cape to Cairo Railway, linking its colonies from the south of Africa to those in the north. This seems unlikely, as in 1890 Germany already controlled German East Africa, now Tanzania, and Sudan was independent under Muhammad Ahmad. Rather, the British government was pressed into taking action by Cecil Rhodes, whose British South Africa Company was founded in 1888 south of the Zambezi and the African Lakes Company and British missionaries to the north. \n\nAt the start of the 19th century, the Portuguese presence in Africa south of the equator was limited in Angola to Luanda and Benguela and a few outposts, the most northerly of which was Ambriz and in Mozambique to the Island of Mozambique, several other coastal trading posts as far south as Delagoa Bay and the virtually independent Prazo estates in the Zambezi valley The first challenge to Portugal's wider claims came from the Transvaal Republic, which in 1868 claimed an outlet to the Indian Ocean at Delagoa Bay. Although in 1869, Portugal and the Transvaal reached agreement on a border under which all of Delagoa Bay was Portuguese, the UK then lodged an objection, claiming the southern part of that bay. The claim was rejected after arbitration by President MacMahon of France. His award made in 1875 upheld the border agreed in 1869. A second challenge came from the foundation of a German colony at Angra Pequena, now known as Lüderitz in Namibia in 1883. Although there was no Portuguese presence there, Portugal had claimed it on the basis of discovery.\n\nA far more serious dispute arose in the area of the Zambezi valley and Lake Nyasa. Portugal occupied the coast of Mozambique from the 16th century, and from 1853 the Portuguese government embarked on a series of military campaigns to bring the Zambezi valley under its effective control. During the 1850s, the areas south of Lake Nyasa (now Lake Malawi) and west of the lake were explored by David Livingstone and several Church of England and Presbyterian missions were established in the Shire Highlands in the 1860s and 1870s. In 1878, the African Lakes Company was established by businessmen with links to the Presbyterian missions. Their aim was to set up a trading company that would work in close cooperation with the missions to combat the slave trade by introducing legitimate trade and develop European influence in the area. A small mission and trading settlement was established at Blantyre in 1876.\n\nPortugal attempted to assert its African territorial claims through three expeditions led by Alexandre de Serpa Pinto, first from Mozambique to the eastern Zambezi in 1869, then to the Congo and upper Zambezi from Angola in 1876 and lastly crossing Africa from Angola in 1877-79. These expeditions were undertaken with the intention of claiming the area between Mozambique and Angola. Following Serpa Pinto’s explorations, the Portuguese government in 1879 made a formal claim to the area south and east of the Ruo River (the present south-eastern border of Malawi) and, in 1882, occupied the lower Shire River valley as far as the Ruo. The Portuguese then asked the British government to accept this territorial claim, but the opening of the Berlin Conference of 1884-85 ended the discussions. Portugal’s efforts to establish this corridor of influence between Angola and Mozambique were hampered by one of the articles in the General Act of the Berlin Conference which required effective occupation of areas claimed rather than historical claims based on discovery or those based on exploration, as Portugal had used.\n\nTo validate Portuguese claims, Serpa Pinto was appointed as its consul in Zanzibar in 1884 and given the mission of exploring the region between Lake Nyasa and the coast from the Zambezi to the Rovuma River and securing the allegiance of the chiefs in that area. His expedition reached Lake Nyasa and the Shire Highlands but failed to make any treaties of protection with the chiefs in territories west of the lake. At the northwest end of Lake Nyasa around Karonga, the African Lakes Company made, or claimed to have made, treaties with local chiefs between 1884 and 1886. Its ambition was to become a Chartered company and control the route from the Lake along the Shire River.\n\nDespite the outcome of the Berlin Conference, the idea of a trans-African Portuguese zone was not abandoned; to help to create it, Portugal signed treaties with France and Germany in 1886. The German treaty noted Portugal’s claim to territory along the course of the Zambezi linking Angola and Mozambique. Following the treaties, the Portuguese foreign minister prepared what became known as the Rose Coloured Map, representing a claim stretching from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean. North of the Zambezi, these Portuguese claims were opposed by both the African Lakes company and the missionaries. The main opposition to Portuguese claims in the south came from Cecil Rhodes, whose British South Africa Company was founded in 1888. As late as 1888, the British Foreign Office declined to offer protection to the tiny British settlements in the Shire Highlands. However, it did not accept the expansion of Portuguese influence there, and in 1889, it appointed Henry Hamilton Johnston as British consul to Mozambique and the Interior, and instructed him to report on the extent of Portuguese rule in the Zambezi and Shire valleys. He was also to make conditional treaties with local rulers outside Portuguese control. The conditional treaties did not establish a British protectorate but prevented the rulers from accepting protection from another state.\n\nIn 1888, the Portuguese government instructed its representatives in Mozambique to make treaties of protection with the Yao chiefs southeast of Lake Nyasa and in the Shire Highlands. Two expeditions were organised, one under Antonio Cardosa, a former governor of Quelimane set off in November 1888 for Lake Nyasa; the second expedition under Serpa Pinto (now governor of Mozambique) moved up the Shire valley. Between them, these two expeditions made over 20 treaties with chiefs in what is now Malawi. Serpa Pinto met Johnston in August 1889 east of the Ruo, when Johnston advised him not to cross the river into the Shire Highlands. Although Serpa Pinto had previously acted with caution, he crossed the Ruo to Chiromo, now in Malawi in September 1889.\n\nThe incursion led to an armed conflict between Portuguese troops led by Serpa Pinto and the Makololo on 8 November 1889 near the Shire river.\n\nFollowing this minor clash, Johnston's vice-consul, John Buchanan, using a diplomatic technique in which the British were well versed, accused Portugal of ignoring British interests in this area and declared a British protectorate over the Shire Highlands in December 1889 despite contrary instructions. Shortly afterward, Johnston himself declared a further protectorate over the area to the west of Lake Nyasa (also contrary to his instructions) although both protectorates were later endorsed by the Foreign Office.\n\nThe actions formed the background to an Anglo-Portuguese crisis in which a British refusal of arbitration was followed by the 1890 British Ultimatum.\n\nThe ultimatum was a memorandum sent to the Portuguese Government by Lord Salisbury on 11 January 1890 in which he demanded the withdrawal of the Portuguese troops from Mashonaland and Matabeleland (now Zimbabwe) and the Shire-Nyasa region (now Malawi), where Portuguese and British interests in Africa overlapped. It meant that the UK was now claiming sovereignty over territories, some of which had been treated as Portuguese for centuries. \n\n\"What Her Majesty's Government require and insist upon is the following: that telegraphic instructions shall be sent to the governor of Mozambique at once to the effect that all and any Portuguese military forces which are actually on the Shire or in the Makololo or in the Mashona territory are to be withdrawn. Her Majesty's Government considers that without this the assurances given by the Portuguese Government are illusory.\nMr. Petre is compelled by his instruction to leave Lisbon at once with all the members of his legation unless a satisfactory answer to this foregoing intimation is received by him in, the course of this evening, and Her Majesty's ship Enchantress is now at Vigo waiting for his orders.\"\n\nThe Mr. Petre mentioned was the British Minister in Lisbon.\n\nAlthough the ultimatum required Portugal to cease from its activities in the disputed areas, there was no similar restriction on further British efforts to establish occupation there. Agents for Rhodes were active in Mashonaland and Manicaland and in what is now eastern Zambia, and John Buchanan asserted British rule in more of the Shire Highlands. There were armed clashes between Portuguese troops who were already in occupation in Manicaland and Rhodes’ incoming men in 1890 and 1891, which ceased only when some areas that had been allocated to Portugal in the unratified 1890 treaty were reassigned to Rhodes’ British South Africa Company in the 1891 treaty, with Portugal being given more land in the Zambezi valley in compensation for this loss.\n\nWhen Portugal acquiesced to British demands, it was considered as a breach of the Treaty of Windsor (1386) and seen as a national humiliation by republicans in Portugal, who denounced the government and the King as responsible for it. The government fell, and António de Serpa Pimentel was appointed prime minister. The British Ultimatum inspired the original lyrics of the Portuguese National Anthem, \"A Portuguesa\". It was considered by Portuguese historians and politicians at that time to be the most outrageous and infamous action of the UK against its oldest ally. The reason that Lord Salisbury and his diplomatically isolated British government used tactics that could have led to war has been plausibly argued as the result of fear of Portuguese occupation of Manicaland and the Shire Highlands, which would have forestalled British interests.\n\nIn an attempt to reach an agreement over Portuguese African borders, the Treaty of London defining the territorial limits of Angola and Mozambique, was signed on 20 August 1890 by Portugal and the United Kingdom. The treaty was published in the \"Diário do Governo\" (Portugal's \"Government Diary\") on 30 August and presented to the parliament that same day, leading to a new wave of protests and the downfall of the Portuguese government. Not only was it never ratified by the Portuguese Parliament but also Cecil Rhodes, whose plans of expansion it affected, also opposed this treaty. A new treaty was negotiated which gave Portugal more territory in the Zambezi valley than the 1890 treaty, but what is now the Manicaland Province of Zimbabwe passed from Portuguese to British control. This treaty was signed in Lisbon on 11 June 1891, and in addition to defining boundaries, it allowed freedom of navigation on the Zambezi and Shire rivers and allowed the UK to lease land for a port at Chinde at the mouth of the Zambezi.\n\nThe 1890 ultimatum was said to be one of the main causes for the Republican Revolution, which ended the monarchy in Portugal 20 years later.\n\n\n"}

It entered into force on 30 October 2001. As of March 2014, it has 47 parties—46 states and the European Union. All of the ratifying states are in Europe and Central Asia. The EU has begun applying Aarhus-type principles in its legislation, notably the Water Framework Directive (Directive 2000/60/EC). Liechtenstein and Monaco have signed the convention but have not ratified it.\n\nThe Aarhus Convention grants the public rights regarding access to information, public participation and access to justice, in governmental decision-making processes on matters concerning the local, national and transboundary environment. It focuses on interactions between the public and public authorities.\n\nThe Aarhus Convention is a multilateral environmental agreement through which the opportunities for citizens to access environmental information are increased and transparent and reliable regulation procedure is secured.\nIt is a way of enhancing the environmental governance network, introducing a reactive and trustworthy relationship between civil society and governments and adding the novelty of a mechanism created to empower the value of public participation in the decision making process and guarantee access to justice: a \"governance-by-disclosure\" that leads a shift toward an environmentally responsible society. \nThe Aarhus Convention was drafted by governments, with the highly required participation of NGOs, and is legally binding for all the States who ratified it becoming Parties. Among the latter is included the EC, who therefore has the task to ensure compliance not only within the member States but also for its institutions, all those bodies who carry out public administrative duties.\nEach Party has the commitment to promote the principles contained in the convention and to fill out a national report, always embracing a consultative and transparent process\n\nThe Aarhus Convention is a rights-based approach: the public, both in the present and in future generations, have the right to know and to live in a healthy environment.\n\nA distinction is made between \"the public\", all the civil society's actors, and the \"public concerned\" precisely, those persons or organisations affected or interested in environmental decision-making (e.g. environmental NGOs).\n\"Public authorities\" are the addressees of the convention, namely, governments, international institutions, and privatized bodies that have public responsibilities or act under the control of public bodies. The private sector, for which information disclosure depends on voluntary, non- mandatory practices, and bodies acting in a judicial or legislative capacity, are excluded.\n\nOther significant provisions are the \"non-discrimination\" principle (all the information has to be provided without taking account of the nationality or citizenship of the applicant), the international nature of the convention, and the importance attributed to the promotion of environmental education of the public.\n\n\nThe Aarhus convention is a \"proceduralisation of the environmental regulation\", it focuses more on setting and listing procedures rather than establishing standards and specifying outcomes, permitting the parties involved to interpret and implement the convention on the systems and circumstances that characterize their nation. This model embodies a perfect example of a multi-level governance.\n\nThe risk could lay in a loss of time and resources that could be otherwise invested in defining the outcomes, notwithstanding the fact that it renders the convention vague, weak and open to multiple interpretations.\nOther critiques note the fact that private bodies are excluded from the mandatory procedures(Mason, 2010), and that, moreover, it can also be debated whether the NGOs involved are faithfully representing environmental interests, ordinary citizens often do not have the financial means to participate effectively and are therefore have no choice but to be represented by these larger organisations. The relative differences between the participants and social groups' resource inequalities also suggests the possibility for irregular and imbalanced environmental protection.\n\nThe Aarhus Convention Compliance Committee was established to fulfill the requirement of Article 15 of the Convention on review of compliance to establish arrangements for reviewing compliance with the Convention.\n\nThe Convention has a unique Compliance Review Mechanism, which can be triggered in four ways: \nThe Compliance mechanism is unique in international environmental law, as it allows members of the public to communicate concerns about a Party's compliance directly to a committee of international legal experts empowered to examine the merits of the case (the Aarhus Convention Compliance Committee). Nonetheless, the Compliance Committee cannot issue binding decisions, but rather makes recommendations to the full Meeting of the Parties (MoP). However, in practise, as MoPs occur infrequently, Parties attempt to comply with the recommendations of the Compliance Committee. As of August 2009, 41 communication from the public – many originating with non-governmental organizations – and one submission from a Party had been lodged with the Convention's Compliance Committee.\n\nThe Kiev Protocol on Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers to the Aarhus Convention was adopted at an extraordinary meeting of the Parties on 21 May 2003, in Kiev, Ukraine. 36 States and the European Community signed the Protocol. As of May 2016, 34 states plus the European Union have ratified the Protocol.\n\nThe Kiev Protocol is the first legally binding international instrument on Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers (PRTRs). PRTRs are inventories of pollution from industrial sites and other sources such as agriculture and transport. The objective of the Protocol is \"to enhance public access to information through the establishment of coherent, nationwide pollutant release and transfer registers (PRTRs).\" The Protocol places indirect obligations on private enterprises to report annually to their national governments on their releases and transfers of pollutants.\n\nParties to the Protocol need not be Parties to the Convention. The Protocol is in this sense a free-standing, international agreement. The Kiev Protocol on PRTRs will enter into force 90 days after the sixteenth State ratifies or accedes to the agreement.\n\nAn amendment to the Aarhus Convention on \"Public Participation in Decisions on Deliberate Release into the Environment and Placing on the Market of Genetically Modified Organisms\" was adopted at the Second Meeting of the Parties on 27 May 2005, in Almaty, Kazakhstan. As of August 2009, it had been ratified by 21 countries. The GMO amendment will enter into force 90 days after at least three-quarters of the Parties to the Aarhus Convention ratify it.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan (1997–2006) has said, \"Although regional in scope, the significance of the Aarhus Convention is global. It is by far the most impressive elaboration of principle 10 of the Rio Declaration, which stresses the need for citizens' participation in environmental issues and for access to information on the environment held by public authorities. As such it is the most ambitious venture in the area of environmental democracy so far undertaken under the auspices of the United Nations.\"\n\nThe influence of the Aarhus Convention also extends beyond the environmental field. At the 2nd Internet Governance Forum, held on 12–15 May 2007, in Rio de Janeiro, the Convention was presented as a model of public participation and transparency in the operation of international forums.\n\n\n"}

In a browse-wrap agreement, the terms and conditions of use for a website or other downloadable product are posted on the website, typically as a hyperlink at the bottom of the screen. Unlike a clickwrap agreement, where the user must manifest assent to the terms and conditions by clicking on an \"I agree\" box, a browse-wrap agreement does not require this type of express manifestation of assent. Rather, a web-site user purportedly gives his or her assent by simply using the product — such as by entering the website or downloading software.\n\nBrowse-wrap agreements, like clickwrap agreements, derive their name by analogy to the \"shrink wrap agreements\" included inside the sealed packaging of tangible products, where one can not see the agreement until the product has been purchased or used. Courts that have ruled on the issue have held that the validity of a browse-wrap agreement primarily depends on whether a website user has actual or constructive notice of the terms and conditions prior to using the website or other product.\n\nIn \"Specht v. Netscape\", the Second Circuit Court of Appeals looked at the enforceability of a browse-wrap contract entered into on the Netscape website. Users of the site were urged to download free software available on the site by clicking on a tinted button labeled \"download\". Only if a user scrolled down the page to the next screen did he come upon an invitation to review the full terms of the program's license agreement, available by hyperlink. The plaintiffs, who had not seen the agreement, downloaded the software and then were later sued for violations of federal privacy and computer fraud statutes arising from the use of the software. The Second Circuit then noted that an essential ingredient to contract formation is the mutual manifestation of assent. The court found that \"a consumer's clicking on a download button does not communicate assent to contractual terms if the offer did not make clear to the consumer that clicking on the download button would signify assent to those terms.\" Because the plaintiffs were not put on notice of these terms they were not bound by them.\n\nIn \"Ticketmaster v. Tickets.com\", the court looked at a breach of contract claim where the terms and conditions were situated at the bottom of the home page in \"small print.\" The court ruled for the defendant in this case but did allow Ticketmaster to replead if there were facts showing that the defendant had knowledge of the terms and implicitly agreed to them.\n\nIn 2005, the Illinois Appellate Court ruled in favor of a browse-wrap agreement in \"Hubbert v. Dell Corp.\" In this case consumers of Dell products were repeatedly shown the words \"All sales are subject to Dell's Term[s] and Conditions of Sale\", including a conspicuous hyperlink, over a series of pages. The court found that this repeated exposure and visual effect would put a reasonable person on notice of the \"terms and conditions\".\n\nIn contrast, in 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled in Nguyen v. Barnes & Noble, Inc. that Barnes & Noble's 2011 Terms of Use agreement, presented in a browse-wrap manner via hyperlinks alone, was not enforceable since it failed to offer users reasonable notice of the terms.\n\nSimilarly, in \"In re Zappos.com, Inc., Customer Data Security Breach Litigation\", the United States District Court for the District of Nevada ruled against Zappos.com's browsewrap terms of use, describing that its presentation was not prominent, and that no reasonable user would have read the agreement.\n\nA browse-wrap agreement can be formed by use of a web page or a hyperlink or small disclaimer on the page. It may only be enforced if the browsing user assents to it. For assent to occur the browse-wrap agreement should be conspicuous, state that there is an agreement, and provide where it can be located. Courts examine the enforceability of browse-wrap agreements on a case-by-case basis, and there are no \"bright-line\" rules on whether a given agreement is sufficiently conspicuous. However, based on \"Specht\", some practitioners believe\n\nthat the icon for the terms of use agreement be placed in the upper left-hand quadrant of the homepage and that all visitors be channeled through the homepage. The reason for this suggestion is that the court will take judicial notice of the fact that all Internet pages open from the upper left-hand quadrant, thus the defendant must overcome the presumption that the icon was viewed. Without this presumption, the plaintiff has the burden of proving the defendant did see the icon.\n\n\n"}

The child's mother, Man Lavette Chen, had selected Northern Ireland as a birthplace for her daughter so that she could gain Irish nationality. As Catherine's parents were only temporary migrants in the UK, she was not eligible for British citizenship simply by virtue of birth in the United Kingdom, as the United Kingdom abolished automatic \"jus soli\" in 1983.\n\nHowever, by being born in Belfast, Catherine was entitled to Irish citizenship because at that time, anyone born on the island of Ireland had the automatic, unrestricted right to Irish citizenship. Thus, Mrs Chen obtained a passport and hence Irish citizenship for Catherine, with the intention of using Catherine's status as a European Union citizen to move the family permanently to Cardiff, Wales. However, British authorities rejected the family's application for permits to reside permanently in the United Kingdom. On appeal, adjudicator Michael Shrimpton of the Immigration Appellate Authority referred the decision to the European Court of Justice, which ruled that, as a citizen of the European Union, Catherine Chen had a right under Article 18 of the EC Treaty to reside anywhere in the EU, and that denying residency to her parents at a time when she is unable to look after herself would conflict with this basic right.\n\nAdvocate General Tizzano stated that it was not an abuse of EU rights to take advantage of the Irish citizenship rules because it is for the Member States and not the EU to decide whether to confer citizenship on a person.\n\nThe court ruled:\n\nThis case and similar examples led to the Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland, making it constitutionally possible in future for the Republic of Ireland to refuse citizenship to individuals who did not have an Irish parent.\n\n\n"}

In 1998, he created a website in French whose name \"Bongo Doit Partir\" (Bongo Must Go) was clearly indicative of its purpose: it encouraged a revolution against the then 29-year-old regime of Omar Bongo in Gabon. The original URL, http://www.globalwebco.net/bdp/, began to redirect to http://www.bdpgabon.org in the year 2000. Inaugurating what was to become common current-day practice in the politically involved blogosphere, this movement's attempt at rallying the Gabonese around revolutionary ideals and actions has ultimately been vindicated by the 2011 Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions, where the Internet has proved to be an effective tool for instigating successful critique, opposition and revolution against dictators.\n\nAt least two nonprofit organizations are currently working to raise awareness of the contributions of cyber-dissidents and to defend them against the human rights violations to which some of them are subjected: Global Voices Online and Reporters Without Borders. The latter has released a \"Handbook For Bloggers and Cyber-Dissidents\" and maintains a roster of currently imprisoned cyber-dissidents. The Committee to Protect Bloggers has been created.\n\nIn regions where print and broadcast media are tightly controlled, anonymous online postings by cyber-dissidents may be the only source of information about the experiences, feelings, and opinions of ordinary citizens. This advantage may be offset by the difficulty in assessing the good faith and accuracy of reports originating from anonymous sources.\n\nRecently, social-media tools have been widely credited with igniting pervasive social upheavals, some of which have even brought down governments.\n\nIn July 2003, Amnesty International reported the arrest of five Gabonese known to be members of the cyber-dissident group \"Bongo Doit Partir\". The five members were detained for three months (See: Gabon: Prisoners of Conscience and Gabon: Further information on Prisoners of conscience.)\n\nIn 2003, Cai Lujun was imprisoned for posting a series of articles online under the pen name \"盼民主\"(\"expecting for democracy\") criticizing the Chinese government.\n\nIn 2006, several bloggers in Egypt were arrested for allegedly defaming the president Hosni Mubarak and expressing critical views about Islam \n\nIn 2005, Mohamad Reza Nasab Abdolahi was imprisoned for publishing an open letter to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei; Mohamad's pregnant wife and other bloggers who commented on Mohamad's treatment were also imprisoned.\n\nWhen Russian president Vladimir Putin in 2006 called on his nation's women to have more children, journalist Vladimir Rakhmankov published a satiric article on the Internet calling Putin \"the nation's phallic symbol\". Rakhmankov was found guilty of offending Vladimir Putin, and fined by the court of the region he lived in to the sum equal of 680 USD. The overall story served as a good adversiting for Rakhmanov's article, that was republished by numerous Russian sources afterwards.\n\nThree Russian bloggers has supposed in 2003, that Russian state security service FSB, the main successor to the KGB, created special teams of people who appear on various blogs to harass and intimidate political bloggers and thus effectively prevent free discussion of undesirable subjects. They referred to such tactics are known as \"active measures\". A Russian critic of this theory has noted in 2003, that security services have more important tasks than flooding in forums.\n\nThe Digital Freedom Network has pointed out cases of imprisoning cyber-dissidents in Vietnam, such as the 2004 case of Pham Que Dong, a former People's Army colonel, military historian who had quit the Communist Party in 1999.

Through separate subsidiaries in High Level, Alberta (\"High Level\") and Red Earth Creek, Alberta (\"Brewster\"), it carried on the business of harvesting logs and manufacturing finished timber. At the beginning of 1999, the subsidiaries were amalgamated into the parent company.\n\nHigh Level was sold later in 1999 to Tolko Industries Ltd., and Brewster in 2000 to Seehta Forest Products. Both transactions included the sale of timber licences, each of which is considered to be a \"timber resource property\" under the \"Income Tax Act\" (Canada). Under Alberta law, consent was granted for the transfer of such licences subject to the condition that the purchaser assume all obligations relating to the reforestation of the land covered by the licence.\n\nIn filing its 1999 and 2000 tax returns Daishowa did not include the amounts relating to the assumption of such liabilities as part of the proceeds of disposition relating to the sale of such properties.

Daishowa appealed the reassessment to the Tax Court of Canada, contending that the fair market value of those liabilities was not determinable at the time of closing and thus should not be included.\n\nAt the TCC, Miller J allowed DMI's appeal of the Minister's reassessment in part. He agreed with the Minister, observing:\n\nHowever, he held that it was not appropriate to add the entire estimated cost of the obligations to the proceeds, preferring to restrict the amount added back to the estimated cost that would take place within the 12 months following each sale, plus 20 percent of the estimated cost of the activities that would take place thereafter.\n\nThe Federal Court of Appeal dismissed Daishowa's appeal, allowed the Minister's cross-appeal and set aside the Judge's decision. In his ruling, Nadon JA (as he then was) agreed with Miller J as to the whether assumption of liabilities formed part of consideration, but held that there was no basis for reducing the value in question:\n\nMainville JA dissented, arguing that the reforestation obligations depressed the value of the timber resource properties, and thus resulted in a lower purchase price than would otherwise have been obtained for the sale.\n\nDaishowa appealed the FCA ruling to the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\nAppeal was allowed, and the matter was returned to the Minister for appropriate reassessment. In a unanimous ruling, Rothstein J dealt with two issues:\n\n\nOn the first issue, he held:\n\nOn the second issue:\n\nIn \"Daishowa\", the SCC made a distinction between obligations that do not affect the value of assets (such as mortgages) and those that affect the value of property (such as the need for repairs). The assumption of the former would be included in the proceeds of disposition, while assumption of the latter would reduce the value (and therefore the purchase price) of the property. This suggests that the distinction can be made based on whether a liability can be described as being embedded in a specific property right or not, which causes the following questions to arise:\n\nDuring the SCC's hearing of the case, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, acting as an intervener, submitted that statutory obligations to reclaim mined land may be so physically connected to the process of mining itself that the obligations cannot be separated from the property right. Rothstein J declared in \"obiter\":\n\nWhile of considerable economic significance to Canadian resource industries, and praised by observers as reflecting commercial common sense, \"Daishowa\" also has great importance in assessing the SCC's \"modern\" approach to statutory interpretation. Although not as extensive in its use of the purposive approach as it was in \"Rizzo Shoes\" or in its earlier case of \"Stubart Investments Ltd. v. The Queen\", it did employ a more restrained approach as seen in \"Copthorne Holdings Ltd. v. Canada\" where Rothstein J (in his decision there) observed that interpretation should not be based on \"a value judgment of what is right or wrong nor with theories about what tax law ought to be or ought to do.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "1818325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1818325", "title": "Deep pocket", "text": "Deep pocket\n\nDeep pocket is an American slang term; it usually means \"extensive financial wealth or resources\". It is usually used in reference to big companies or organizations (ex: the American tobacco companies have \"deep pockets\"), although it can be used in reference to wealthy individuals (e.g., Bill Gates, Warren Buffett).\n\nIn the context of a lawsuit, the deep pocket is often the target defendant, even when the true (moral) culpability is with another party because the deep pocket has money to pay a verdict. For example, a lawyer may comment that he or she sued the manufacturer of a product rather than the seller because it is the deep pocket, meaning it has more money than the seller with which to compensate the victim.\n\nThe term “deep pockets” (also given as “deep pocket” and “deep pocketed\") is attested sparsely in the 1940s through the 1960s, but became popular with the litigation explosion of the 1970s.\n\nA person with “short arms” and “deep pockets” is a person (sometimes derided as “miserly” or “cheap\") who saves money and doesn’t often spend it. The term “short arms and deep/long pockets” is cited in print from at least 1952.\n\nIn Ireland, this phrase was attached to a wealthy business man from Tipparary who, upon his round of drinks, would break his glass on the floor, knowing the owner of the pub would ask him to leave. This was also called the “O’Shea Fiddle”.\n\nDeep pocket is a concept often used in the law and economics of tort law. It refers to the idea that the risk of an activity should be borne by a person who is in a relatively good position to handle it. This can be achieved by either spreading the risk over a large number of risk-bearers (usually by means of insurance), or by imposing it on a person who is relatively risk-neutral. The latter is often assumed to be the case for wealthy individuals or large corporations, who are referred to as having \"deep pockets\", since their wealth will not be affected very strongly if the risk materializes. For example, a deep-pocket argument might, among other arguments, be used to justify product liability, as producers with \"deep pockets\" will normally be better able to accommodate the risk of damages than individual consumers not endowed with \"deep pockets\".\n\nA variation on the term refers to the special subtype of frivolous litigation where plaintiffs target wealthy or corporate defendants for little other reason than them having high resources. These cases involve plaintiffs who have suffered genuine damages, but the true culpability lies squarely with an individual or small entity who has very little money that could be collected if the suit was won. Instead, the plaintiff targets the nearest marginally related large corporation or wealthy defendant, often with a weak accusation of negligence. A popular example is a person being shot by a criminal, and suing the manufacturer of the firearm instead of their attacker. Sometimes legislation is passed to prevent such lawsuits, such as the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act.\n\n"}

United States, 309 U.S. 436 (1940), was a decision of the United States Supreme Court that limited the doctrine of the Court's 1938 decision in \"General Talking Pictures Corp. v. Western Electric Co.\" Beginning with the 1926 decision in \"United States v. General Electric Co.\", the Supreme Court made a sharp distinction between (i) post-sale restraints that a patentee imposed on purchasers of a patented product and (ii) restrictions (limitations) that a patentee imposed on a licensee to manufacture a patented product: the former being illegal and unenforceable under the exhaustion doctrine while the latter were generally permissible under a lenient \"rule of reason.\" Thus, under the \"General Talking Pictures\" doctrine, a patent holder may permissibly license others to \"manufacture\" and then sell patented products in only a specified field (market), such as only a particular type of product made under the patent or only a particular category of customer for the patented product. The \"Ethyl\" decision held, however, that a patent licensing and distribution program based on both the sale of a patented product and licenses to manufacture a related product was subject to ordinary testing under the antitrust laws, and accordingly was illegal when its effect was to \"regiment\" an entire industry.\n\nEthyl owned several patents on tetra-ethyl lead, an anti-knock fuel additive, and on its utilization: two patents on the chemical itself, a patent on a motor fuel—gasoline containing tetra-ethyl lead, and a patent on a method of using the fuel in an automobile engine.\n\nEthyl established an elaborate licensing program under its several patents: Ethyl sold the fuel additive, and licensed purchasers to use it to practice the other patents. The licensing program fixed prices for the motor fuel and strictly limited the types of customer (\"i.e.\", no price-cutters) to which given licensees could sell the motor fuel. Ethyl's program \"controls the business of the major part of those engaged in manufacturing and distributing [gasoline] in the United States.\" Ethyl licensed almost every US refiner and its licensees refined 88% of the gasoline in the US. It was Ethyl's \"long established practice . . . to refuse to grant licenses to jobbers who cut prices or refuse to conform to the marketing policies and posted prices of the major refineries or the market leaders among them.\" \n\nThe United States sued Ethyl for violating the antitrust laws, and Ethyl claimed that its patents exempted its conduct.\n\nEthyl emphasized to the Supreme Court the fact that, while it \"sold\" the fuel to refiners subject to a \"post-sale restraint\", it \"licensed\" the other patents, which covered the \"manufacture\" of the fuel (by adding tetra-ethyl lead to ordinary gasoline) and the method of using the fuel in automobile engines. Ethyl argued that the licensed patents and the manufacturing brought the case within the shelter of the \"General Talking Pictures\" doctrine. Ethyl urged that the various restrictions were \"all reasonably necessary for the commercial development of [its] patents and for insuring a financial return from them, and are therefore within its patent monopoly.\" Further, they \"are appropriate and reasonably adapted to the maintenance of the quality of the product and for the protection of the public in its use of a product containing a dangerous poison.\" \n\nThe Supreme Court, in an opinion written by Chief Justice Harlan F. Stone, refused without dissent to make any distinctions among the different patents and struck the whole program down for improperly “regimenting” the industry in violation of the antitrust laws.\n\nThe Court said that Ethyl used its patents and licensing program to obtain\nthe power to exclude at will from participation in the nationwide market for lead-treated motor fuel all of the 12,000 motor fuel jobbers of the country, by refusing to license any of the 1,000 unlicensed jobbers, or by cancelling, as it may at will, the licenses of any of the 11,000 licensed jobbers. \n\nIt then unlawfully \n\nexercise[d] that power in such manner as to control the patented commodity in the hands of the licensed jobbers who had purchased it, [and] their actions with respect to it in ways not within the limits of the patent monopoly, and conspicuously among such controls which the Sherman law prohibits and the patent law does not sanction is the regulation of prices and the suppression of competition among the purchasers of the patented articles. \n\nRelying on the exhaustion doctrine and citing \"Adams v. Burke\", the Court stated:\n\nBy its sales to refiners, it relinquishes its exclusive right to use the patented fluid and it relinquishes to the licensed jobbers its exclusive rights to sell the lead-treated fuel by permitting the licensed refiners to manufacture and sell the fuel to them. And, by the authorized sales of the fuel by refiners to jobbers, the patent monopoly over it is exhausted, and, after the sale, neither [Ethyl] nor the refiners may longer rely on the patents to exercise any control over the price at which the fuel may be resold.\n\nThe Court found this violative of the antitrust laws:\n\n[Ethyl] has established the marketing of the patented fuel in vast amounts on a nationwide scale through the 11,000 jobbers and, at the same time, by the leverage of its licensing contracts resting on the fulcrum of its patents, it has built up a combination capable of use, and actually used, as a means of controlling jobbers' prices and suppressing competition among them. It seems plain that this attempted regulation of prices and market practices of the jobbers with respect to the fuel purchased, for which [Ethyl] could not lawfully contract, cannot be lawfully achieved by entering into contracts or combinations through the manipulation of which the same results are reached by the exercise of the power which they give to control the action of the purchasers. Such contracts or combinations, which are used to obstruct the free and natural flow in the channels of interstate commerce of trade even in a patented article, after it is sold by the patentee or his licensee, are a violation of the Sherman Act.\n\nThe Court found it particularly objectionable that Ethyl exploited its patents by fixing the prices on which gasoline was sold, which was not the product that Ethyl manufactured and sold. \"The licensing conditions are thus not used as a means of stimulating the commercial development and financial returns of the patented invention which is licensed, but for the commercial development of the business of the refiners and the exploitation of a second patent monopoly not embraced in the first.\" \n"}

They studied Roman law based on the \"Digesta\", the \"Codex\" of Justinian, the \"Authenticum\" (an abridged Latin translation of selected constitutions of Justinian, promulgated in Greek after the enactment of the \"Codex\" and therefore called \"Novellae\"), and his law manual, the \"Institutiones Iustiniani\", compiled together in the \"Corpus Iuris Civilis\". (This title is itself only a sixteenth-century printers' invention.) Their work transformed the inherited ancient texts into a living tradition of medieval Roman law.\n\nThe glossators conducted detailed text studies that resulted in collections of explanations. For their work they used a method of study unknown to the Romans themselves, insisting that contradictions in the legal material were only apparent. They tried to harmonize the sources in the conviction that for every legal question only one binding rule exists. Thus they approached these legal sources in a dialectical way, which is a characteristic of medieval scholasticism. They sometimes needed to invent new concepts not found in Roman law, such as half-proof (evidence short of full proof but of some force, such as a single witness). In other medieval disciplines, for example theology and philosophy, glosses were also made on the main authoritative texts.\n\nIn the Greek language, γλῶσσα (\"glossa\") means \"tongue\" or \"language.\" Originally, the word was used to denote an explanation of an unfamiliar word, but its scope gradually expanded to the more general sense of \"commentary\". The glossators used to write in the margins of the old texts (\"glosa marginalis\") or between the lines (\"glosa interlinearis\" - interlinear glosses). Later these were gathered into large collections, first copied as separate books, but also quickly written in the margins of the legal texts. The medieval copyists at Bologna developed a typical script to enhance the legibility of both the main text and the glosses. The typically Bolognese script is called the Littera Bononiensis.\n\nAccursius's \"Glossa ordinaria\", the final standard redaction of these glosses, contains around 100,000 glosses. Accursius worked for decades on this task. There exists no critical edition of his glosses.\n\nThe medieval lawyers also wrote glosses on the medieval texts of Canon law such as the Decretum Gratiani (around 1140), the \"Liber Extra\" of Gregory IX (1234), the \"Liber Sextus\" of Boniface VIII (1298) and later smaller collections of papal decretals, verdicts in letter form sent to papal delegates. The decrets of the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215, too, have received glosses.\n\nIn the older historiography of the medieval \"learned law\", the view developed that after the standard gloss had become fixed a generation of so-called \"commentators\" started to take over from the glossators. In fact, the early medieval legal scholars, too, wrote commentaries and lectures, but their main effort was indeed creating glosses.\n\nMost of the older glosses are accessible only in medieval manuscripts: modern editions of only a few manuscripts exist. The main microfilm collections of glossed legal manuscripts are at the Max Planck Institute for European Legal History in Frankfurt am Main, at the universities of Munich, Würzburg, Milan, Leyden and Berkeley.\n\n\n"}

This complaint alleges that the third party is liable for all or part of the damages that the original plaintiff may win from the original defendant.\n\nThe theory is that two cases may be decided together and justice may be done more efficiently than by having two suits in a series.\n\nCommon bases of contingent or derivative liability by which third parties may be impleaded include indemnity, subrogation, contribution, and warranty.\n\nFor example, in a case where a driver rear-ended another car due to faulty brakes, and is sued by the accident victim, the driver may decide to implead the repair shop where the brakes were worked on because the driver's liability derives from the repair shop's liability for their faulty repair of the brakes.\n\nAn example of this is Rule 14 (\"Third Party Practice\") of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\nRule 14(a)(1): The nonparty must be served with the third party complaint as well as a summons.

{"id": "23858543", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23858543", "title": "Italian Senior Civil Service", "text": "Italian Senior Civil Service\n\nIn Italy the Senior Civil Service or \"la dirigenza\" is the set of high-ranking executives (“Dirigenti”) who are in charge of the top and middle management of national or local governmental offices.\n\nSenior executives come in two echelons:\nFirst and second level positions are identified in each ministry. Management responsibilities (supervision of one or more bureaux) determine whether or not someone is an executive, not qualifications. This objective approach shows the exact number of first level executives and permits the development of a database with up-to-date information about age, seniority, gender, level and ministry.\nIn each ministry, second level positions are further classified accordingly to the responsibilities attached to their offices position, corresponding to the classification adopted by the ministry.\n\nUntil October 2002, the Senior Civil Service was meant to be an inter-ministerial homogeneous body, managed by a pool known as the \"Ruolo Unico dei Dirigenti\" (Uniform Register). The creation of this structure, under the supervision of the Prime Minister, was the backbone of the reform conducted from 1993 till 2001. It was underpinned by a database of jobs and profiles. This tool allowed the government to publish available positions in real time and to establish a labour market for managers. The new text adopted in 2002 has replaced inter-ministerial management of executives with ministerial management. However, the inter-ministerial database and the labour market for first level executives have been kept.\n\nOther public bodies, at national and local level, have their Senior Civil Services. \nToday senior civil servants are grouped into eight different contractual areas: \n\nCivil servants below executive level have a different contract with separate grading and pay arrangements.\n\nExecutives are normally recruited through competitions. There are two types of competition:\n\n\nThe executive group is increasingly targeting people from the private sector, universities and regional entities, which currently account for 10% of first level executives and 8% of second level. External candidates can only be hired for a fixed term.\n\nThe status of executives has been governed by private law since 1998. A collective bargaining agreement (drafted by ARAN, the agency representing the public employer and the executives' trade union), stipulates the management conditions required in individual contracts. In other words, a senior executive signs two contracts:\n\n\nFixed-term contracts may not exceed three years for first level executives and five years for executives. These contracts set out the remuneration terms. In 2002, the minister was given the job of setting objectives, which must be very precise, reducing the role of the contract. Achievement of the objectives is nevertheless verified every year based on management control and strategic-planning results.\n\nFirst level SEOs must be confirmed by every new government, or they lose their position.\n\nThe pay structure emphasizes workload, merit and work performance (\"pay for performance\"), while it has no regard to seniority and length of service.\n\nPay is based on:\n\nExecutives are subjected to an annual assessment based on achievement of objectives, the adequacy\nof actions implemented in compliance with ministerial directives and the information supplied by the\nmanagement-control and strategic-assessment service. Executives whose contract expires are assessed to\ndetermine whether to keep and/or to promote them.\n\nAssessment disputes are reviewed by an appeal committee.\n\nWhen an executive cannot immediately find a new position on termination of a fixed-term contract, he /she keeps part of his fixed wage (60% of the remuneration).\n\nAn executive's career does not follow a straight line. On completion of a fixed-term contract, he or she can move from a grade C position to a grade A position if assessment results are highly satisfactory. In order to encourage both internal promotion and competition, 40% of the positions of director generals may be filled by second level executives and 10% by non-government personalities.\n\nWhen the \"rotation\" obligation was formally withdrawn in the decree of October 2002 (probably because of shorter contracts), the principle of mobility was preserved. It is supported by an inter-ministerial database with real-time vacancies at every ministry. \nFive-year stints in the private sector and international organisations are also encouraged. These do not affect the executive's career.\n\nContinuing education is covered by a directive from 2001 whose purpose was to galvanise training plans, considered a primary tool for leading change at government services. Today, training must be mentioned in resumes published in the interministerial database. The purpose of this requirement is to give executives a strong incentive to get trained. In order to promote the use of management methodologies and recognition of international concerns in executive actions, executives are now entitled to work for up to five years in the private sector or in international organisations with the right to return to the executive group without loss of prerogatives.\n\nLastly, line managers can become researchers. A plan launched by the Public Administration School allows interested executives to research useful government modernisation themes under research teachers.\n\nIn February 1993, a founding legislative decree introduced contracts for officials who are now employed under general labour laws.\n\n\nWhile the decree of 1993 remains the basis for every senior management reform, three periods can be distinguished, each of which raised contractualisation to a new level:\n\na) 1993 to 1998: the \"privatisation\" recommended in the working note did not yet apply to first level executives. Their appointments and performance obligations remained the minister's responsibility. Their pay reflected standard scales. Other managers were governed by collective bargaining agreements.\n\nb) 1998 to 2002: collective bargaining agreements became applicable to first level executives. They signed fixed-term contracts under private law specifying objectives and pay. The reform created an inter-ministerial management structure. In principle, all executives should have been lumped in this pool, which the ministries could have sourced for needed profiles. In fact, the ministries remained in control, trying to keep their best executives. Mobility was boosted by the development of an inter-ministerial database with the resumes of all first level executives and a list of available positions updated in real time. The years ahead can be expected to lead gradually to the creation of a genuine labour market.\n\nc) Since October 2002: the appointment and objectives of first level executives are fixed by decree (unilateral public act). Their pay is negotiated bilaterally and laid down in a private contract signed for the term of their appointment (3 years or less). The \"ruolo unico dei dirigenti\" has made way for ministerial pools but the inter-ministerial database continues to be used. The objective remains to promote mobility.\n\nThe newly organised \"dirigenza\" became the launch pad for the modernisation of public management. The new management of senior management has made the civil service more politically neutral and, as such, has clarified the respective roles of politics and the civil service. The main purpose of the newly created dirigenza was to remedy the lack of professionalism and the political bias of the hallowed senior public service by fostering a culture of excellence within the government and promoting close relations based on shared principles combining the founding values of the civil service - integrity, neutrality and impartiality - with the more pragmatic qualities demanded from managers. This ethics of accountability remains the cornerstone of all texts adopted since 1993.\n\n\n"}

It declared itself the supreme authority of the Kingdom from June 18, 1808, during the Peninsular war and due to the abdication of the King, and until Galicia was conquered by the Napoleonic troops in 1809.\n\nInitially the \"Xuntas Generales del Reino de Galicia\" was an assembly where representatives of the three states of the Kingdom (noblemen, churchmen, and the commoners) met. But soon it followed the evolution prompted by the King of Spain in other representative institutions, such as the Cortes of Castile, so becoming monopolized by the bourgeoisie and lesser nobility (\"fidalgos\"), who controlled most of the local councils of the cities and towns of the Kingdom, and at the expenses of Church and nobility. From 1599 the composition of the assembly became fixed and reduced to just seven deputies, each one representing one of the Kingdom provinces, and appointed by the council of the province's capital —Santiago de Compostela, A Coruña, Betanzos, Lugo, Mondoñedo, Ourense, and Tui— from among its members. Other towns, namely Viveiro and Pontevedra, tried during the 17th and 18th century to regain a direct representative in the assembly, to no effect.\n\nThe \"Xunta\", whilst having little direct intervention in law making, and not much control over the Royal administration, could nevertheless rise armies, ships and taxes, conceding or denying the King's petitions on behalf of all the local powers of the Kingdom; the assembly could also petition the King himself, this being the usual mean it used for modifying or approving laws, or for promoting the interests of the Kingdom. The \"Xunta\" was also recognized as the voice and representative of the Kingdom, and the depositary of its will, traditions and rights (\"foros\").\n\nNotwithstanding, the King never consented on the petition of the assembly to meet at will, and from 1637 he decreed that the meetings of the assembly can only take place when in presence of one representative of the monarch, with voice, usually the Governor-Captain General of the Kingdom, so trying to maintain a tighter grip on the institution and its agreements. From the 18th century, with the advent of the absolutists Bourbon monarchs, the \"Xunta\" was gradually deprived of its powers.\n\n"}
{"id": "219287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=219287", "title": "Legal person", "text": "Legal person\n\nA legal person (in legal contexts often simply person, less ambiguously legal entity) is any human or non-human entity, in other words, any human being, firm, or government agency that is recognized as having privileges and obligations, such as having the ability to enter into contracts, to sue, and to be sued.\n\nThe term \"legal person\" is however ambiguous because it is also used in contradistinction to \"natural person\", i.e. as a synonym of terms used to refer only to non-human legal entities.\n\nSo there are of two kinds of legal entities, human and non-human: natural persons (also called \"physical persons\") and juridical persons (also called \"juridic\", \"juristic\", \"artificial\", \"legal\", or \"fictitious persons\", ), which are other entities (such as corporations) that are treated in law as if they were persons.\n\nWhile human beings acquire legal personhood when they are born (or even before in some jurisdictions), juridical persons do so when they are incorporated in accordance with law.\n\nLegal personhood is a prerequisite to legal capacity, the ability of any legal person to amend (enter into, transfer, etc.) rights and obligations.\n\nIn international law, consequently, legal personality is a prerequisite for an international organization to be able to sign international treaties in its own name.\n\nArtificial personality, juridical personality, or juristic personality is the characteristic of a non-living entity regarded by law to have the status of personhood.\n\nA juridical or artificial person (; also juristic person) has a legal name and has certain rights, protections, privileges, responsibilities, and liabilities in law, similar to those of a natural person. The concept of a juridical person is a fundamental legal fiction. It is pertinent to the philosophy of law, as it is essential to laws affecting a corporation (corporations law).\n\nJuridical personhood allows one or more natural persons (\"universitas personarum\") to act as a single entity (body corporate) for legal purposes. In many jurisdictions, artificial personality allows that entity to be considered under law separately from its individual members (for example in a company limited by shares, its shareholders). They may sue and be sued, enter contracts, incur debt, and own property. Entities with legal personality may also be subjected to certain legal obligations, such as the payment of taxes. An entity with legal personality may shield its members from personal liability.\n\nIn some common law jurisdictions a distinction is drawn between \"corporation aggregate\" (such as a company, which has a number of members) and a \"corporation sole\" (which is where a person's public office is deemed to have a separate personality from them as an individual). Both have separate legal personality. Historically most corporations sole were ecclesiastical in nature (for example, the Archbishop of Canterbury is a corporation sole), but a number of other public offices are now formed as corporations sole.\n\nThe concept of juridical personality is not absolute. \"Piercing the corporate veil\" refers to looking at the individual natural persons acting as agents involved in a company action or decision; this may result in a legal decision in which the rights or duties of a corporation or public limited company are treated as the rights or liabilities of that corporation's members or directors.\n\nThe concept of a juridical person is now central to Western law in both common-law and civil-law countries, but it is also found in virtually every legal system.\n\nSome examples of juridical persons include:\n\n\nNot all organizations have legal personality. For example, the board of directors of a corporation, legislature, or governmental agency typically are not legal persons in that they have no ability to exercise legal rights independent of the corporation or political body which they are a part of.\n\nThe concept of legal personhood for organizations of people is at least as old as Ancient Rome: a variety of collegial institutions enjoyed the benefit under Roman law.\n\nThe doctrine has been attributed to Pope Innocent IV, who seems at least to have helped spread the idea of \"persona ficta\" as it is called in Latin. In canon law, the doctrine of \"persona ficta\" allowed monasteries to have a legal existence that was apart from the monks, simplifying the difficulty in balancing the need for such groups to have infrastructure though the monks took vows of personal poverty. Another effect of this was that as a fictional person, a monastery could not be held guilty of delict due to not having a soul, helping to protect the organization from non-contractual obligations to surrounding communities. This effectively moved such liability to individuals acting within the organization while protecting the structure itself, since individuals were considered to have a soul and therefore capable of being guilty of negligence and excommunicated.\n\nIn the common law tradition, only a person could sue or be sued. This was not a problem in the era before the Industrial Revolution, when the typical business venture was either a sole proprietorship or partnership—the owners were simply liable for the debts of the business. A feature of the corporation, however, is that the owners/shareholders enjoyed limited liability—the owners were \"not\" liable for the debts of the company. Thus, when a corporation breached a contract or broke a law, there was no remedy, because limited liability protected the owners and the corporation wasn't a legal person subject to the law. There was no accountability for corporate wrongdoing.\n\nTo resolve the issue, the legal personality of a corporation was established to include five legal rights—the right to a common treasury or chest (including the right to own property), the right to a corporate seal (i.e., the right to make and sign contracts), the right to sue and be sued (to enforce contracts), the right to hire agents (employees) and the right to make by-laws (self-governance).\n\nSince the 19th century, legal personhood has been further construed to make it a citizen, resident, or domiciliary of a state (usually for purposes of personal jurisdiction). In \"Louisville, C. & C.R. Co. v. Letson\", 2 How. 497, 558, 11 L.Ed. 353 (1844), the U.S. Supreme Court held that for the purposes of the case at hand, a corporation is \"capable of being treated as a citizen of [the State which created it], as much as a natural person.\" Ten years later, they reaffirmed the result of Letson, though on the somewhat different theory that \"those who use the corporate name, and exercise the faculties conferred by it,\" should be presumed conclusively to be citizens of the corporation's State of incorporation. Marshall v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 16 How. 314, 329, 14 L.Ed. 953 (1854). These concepts have been codified by statute, as U.S. jurisdictional statutes specifically address the domicile of corporations.\n\n\nThe term juridical person (\"pessoa jurídica\" in Portuguese) is used in legal science for designating an entity with rights and liabilities which also has legal personality. Its regulations are largely based on Brazil's Civil Code, where it is distinctly recognized and defined, among other normative documents.\n\nBrazilian law recognizes any association or abstract entity as a juridical person, but a registry is required through a Constitutional Document, with specifications depending on the category of Juridical Person and local law of state and city.\n\nArticle 19(3) of the German Constitution sets forth: \"Fundamental rights shall also apply to domestic artificial persons insofar as the nature of such rights shall permit.\"\n\nIn Italy trade unions have legal personality, as stated in Article 39, Paragraph 4 of the Constitution:\n\nSection 28 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 provides: \"... the provisions of this Bill of Rights apply, so far as practicable, for the benefit of all legal persons as well as for the benefit of all natural persons.\"\n\nFor a typical example of the concept of legal person in a civil law jurisdiction, under the General Principles of Civil Law of the People's Republic of China, Chapter III, Article 36., \"A legal person shall be an organization that has capacity for civil rights and capacity for civil conduct and independently enjoys civil rights and assumes civil obligations in accordance with the law.\" Note however that the term civil right means something altogether different in civil law jurisdictions than in common law jurisdictions.\n\nIn part based on the principle that legal persons are simply organizations of natural persons, and in part based on the history of statutory interpretation of the word \"person\", the US Supreme Court has repeatedly held that certain constitutional rights protect legal persons (such as corporations and other organizations). \"Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad\" is sometimes cited for this finding because the court reporter's comments included a statement the Chief Justice made before oral arguments began, telling the attorneys during pre-trial that \"the court does not wish to hear argument on the question whether the provision in the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which forbids a State to deny any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws, applies to these corporations. We are all of the opinion that it does.\"\n\nLater opinions interpreted these pre-argument comments as part of the legal decision. As a result, because of the First Amendment, Congress may not make a law restricting the free speech of a corporation or a political action group or dictating the coverage of a local newspaper, and because of the Due Process Clause, a state government may not take the property of a corporation without using due process of law and providing just compensation. These protections apply to all legal entities, not just corporations.\n\nA prominent component of relevant case law is the Supreme Court decision \"Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission\", which ruled unconstitutional certain restrictions on corporate campaign spending during elections.\n\nIn Act II, Scene 1 of Gilbert and Sullivan's \"The Gondoliers\", Giuseppe Palmieri (who serves, jointly with his brother Marco, as King of Barataria) requests that he and his brother be also recognized individually so that they might each receive individual portions of food as they have \"two independent appetites\". He is, however, turned down by the Court (made up of fellow Gondolieri) because the joint rule \"... is a legal person, and legal person are solemn things.\"\n\n\n\n\nMajor legal factors affecting business\n"}

A banning order entailed restrictions on where the banned person could live and who they could have contact with, required that they report weekly to a police station, and also proscribed them from traveling outside a specific magisterial district and from appearing or speaking in public. It proscribed broadcasters and the press from broadcasting, publishing or reporting the banned person's words. It thus mixed elements of internal exile, suppression orders and censorship.\n\nContact restrictions under a banning order typically included a prescribed maximum number of other people permitted to be in the same room with the banned person at any time. As few as two other people might be permitted. The banned person was forbidden all contact with other banned persons and was forbidden to engage in political, social or community organizing.\n\nThe legislative authority for banning orders was the Suppression of Communism Act, 1950, which defined virtually all opposition to apartheid as \"Communism\".

Thompson\n\nMerrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Thompson, 478 U.S. 804 (1986), was a United States Supreme Court decision involving the original jurisdiction of the federal district courts under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question jurisdiction).\n\nThe Thompsons, residents of Canada, and the MacTavishes, residents of Scotland, filed virtually identical complaints against Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals in the Court of Common Pleas in Hamilton County, Ohio, claiming negligence, fraud, breach of warranty, and misbranding in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA). The mother in each family had taken the drug Bendectin during pregnancy which they claimed caused harm to their children including birth defects.\n\nThe case was filed in state court and then removed to federal district court where it was found that Count IV (the misbranding count) of the complaint alleged a cause of action arising under federal law and the motion to remand was denied. It then granted petitioner's motion to dismiss on forum non conveniens grounds. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed claiming that the FDCA did not create or imply a private right to sue for injury resulting in no federal subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nThe question raised was whether the federal district courts have original federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 when a claim arises out of a federal statute that has not specifically granted a private right to a cause of action. The case considered several different tests to determine when a case is covered under original jurisdiction for the federal courts. These tests include:\n\nHolmes' \"Creation\" Test:\nThe \"vast majority\" of cases that come within this grant of jurisdiction are covered by Justice Holmes' statement that a \"`suit arises under the law that creates the cause of action.'\"\n\n\"Franchise Tax Board\" Test:\nThe Court has also granted jurisdiction \"where the vindication of a right under state law necessarily turned on some construction of federal law.\"\n\n\"Smith\" Test (Quoting from the dissent):\n\"The general rule is that where it appears from the bill or statement of the plaintiff that the right to relief depends upon the construction or application of the Constitution or laws of the United States, and that such federal claim is not merely colorable, and rests upon a reasonable foundation, the District Court has jurisdiction [478 U.S. 804, 820] under [the statute granting federal question jurisdiction].\"\n\nThe Court affirmed the Sixth Circuit and ruled that there was no federal question jurisdiction.\n\nJustice Stevens, writing for the majority, took as his starting point the conclusion that Congress did not intend a private Federal cause of action for violations of the FDCA; in other words, private parties may not bring a suit solely on the basis of a violation of the Act. This was the Sixth Circuit's determination, and it was not disputed by any of the parties to the suit.\n\nThe Court states that the significance of the lack of a Federal cause of action \"cannot be overstated.\" The ruling relies heavily on the notion of respect for congressional intent. The Court interprets the fact that Congress did not create a cause of action to be conclusive evidence that Congress did not intend for claimed violations of the FDCA as elements of a state cause of action to be \"substantial\" enough to confer federal-question jurisdiction.\n\nJustice Brennan, writing for the dissent, argued that there is federal jurisdiction whenever a federal question is an ingredient of the action. Furthermore, there may be federal question jurisdiction even though both the right asserted and the remedy sought by a plaintiff are state created. Additionally, federal courts are much more adept at interpreting and applying federal law, and more likely to correctly understand Congress’ intent in enacting legislation than are state courts.\n\nIt was not entirely clear from the opinion whether lack of a private cause of action will always be dispositive in every case. The Court clarified the issue in \"Grable & Sons Metal Products, Inc. v. Darue Engineering & Mfg.\", saying that the absence of a right of action is relevant evidence of congressional intent, but does not necessarily decide the question in all cases.\n\n"}

Forced into exile by the communist authorities, he became a political refugee and currently resides in France as a stateless person. After 2000, Goma has expressed opinions on World War II, the Holocaust in Romania and the Jews, claims which have led to widespread criticism for antisemitism.\n\nGoma was born to a Romanian family in Mana village, Orhei County, which at that time was a part of the Kingdom of Romania, nowadays part of Republic of Moldova. His parents, Eufimie Goma (1909–1967) and Maria Goma (\"née\" Popescu; 1909–1974), were schoolteachers in Mana. His brother Petre was born in 1933, but died before his first birthday.\n\nAfter the 1940 Soviet occupation of Bessarabia, Paul Goma's father was taken away by the Soviet authorities and deported to Siberia. In October 1943, Eufimie Goma was found by his family, as a prisoner of war, in \"Camp No. 1 for Soviet Prisoners\", in Slobozia, Ialomiţa County, Romania.\n\nIn March 1944, the Goma family took refuge in Sibiu, Transylvania. In August 1944, finding themselves in danger of involuntary \"repatriation\" to the Soviet Union, they fled to the village of Buia, by the Târnava Mare River. From October to December 1944, the Goma family hid in the forests around Buia. On January 13, 1945 they were captured by Romanian shepherds and turned over to the Gendarmerie in Sighişoara, where they were interned at the \"Centrul de Repatriere\" (\"Repatriation Center\"). There, Eufimie Goma managed to forge documents for his family; however, Maria Goma's brother, who didn't have forged papers, was promptly \"repatriated to Siberia\". In June 1945, taking advantage of the forged documents, they returned to Buia. Later on, Paul Goma would describe his family's refugee saga in the novels \"Arta refugii\" (\"The Art of Refuge\", a wordplay on the Romanian words for \"refuge\" and \"taking flight\"), \"Soldatul câinelui\" (\"Dog's Soldier\"), and \"Gardă inversă\" (\"Reverse Guard\").\n\nIn May 1952, Goma, while a student in 10th grade, was detained for eight days by the Securitate for speaking out in the classroom about Romanian anti-communist partisans and for keeping a coded personal journal. In September–October of the same year he was barred from all the schools in Romania. After some unsuccessful attempts at re-admission he was finally allowed to attend Radu Negru high school in Făgăraş.\n\nIn 1954 he was admitted to the Faculty of Letters of the University of Bucharest. In November 1956, he was part of the Bucharest student movement of 1956: during a seminar, he read out to other students parts of a novel he had written about a student who establishes a movement that is similar to the ones in Hungary during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. Goma was arrested on the charge of attempting to organize a strike at University of Bucharest and he was sentenced to two years in prison. He served his sentence Jilava and Gherla prisons, and then put under house arrest in Lăteşti (a village in the Bărăgan Plain) until 1963.\n\nAs a former political prisoner, he was not allowed to resume his studies and he had to work as a manual labourer until 1965, when a decree allowed former prisoners to study at the University. In September 1965, he was re-admitted as a first-year student at the Faculty of Letters of the University of Bucharest. In the fall of 1967, under pressure from the Securitate, he was forced to give up his studies at the University. On August 7, 1968, Paul Goma married Ana Maria Năvodaru. Their son Filip-Ieronim was born in 1975.\n\nAt the end of August 1968, Paul Goma became a member of the Romanian Communist Party, in an act of solidarity with the Romanian position during the Warsaw Pact Invasion of Czechoslovakia (Romania did not take part, indeed condemning the invasion).\n\nSeveral months later, Goma attempted to publish a novel, \"Ostinato\" (based on his experiences with the secret police), but it was not allowed by the censors, after one of them claimed to recognize one character as Elena Ceaușescu. Nevertheless, he published the novel in translation in West Germany in 1971, as a result of which, Paul Goma was excluded from the Communist Party. Paul Goma refused to give up his Party membership by his own will.\n\nDuring the summer of 1972, he was allowed to visit France, where he wrote \"Gherla\", a novel based on his experiences in the Gherla Prison. This book was also denied publication in Romania and it was published in France in 1976.\n\nIn 1977, Paul Goma wrote a public letter expressing solidarity with the Charter 77, but, finding few friends willing to sign it, wrote another letter, addressed directly to Ceaușescu, in which he asked him to sign it, as they two (Goma and Ceaușescu) are the only two Romanians not afraid of the Securitate. Following this, he wrote another letter (addressed to the 35 countries in the CSCE) in which he called for respect for human rights in Romania.\n\nOn 17 February 1977, Ceaușescu made a speech in which he attacked the \"traitors of the country\", referring to the two letters Goma wrote. The following day, a police cordon was in front of his building, not allowing non-residents, to prevent people from signing Goma's letter. The authorities tried to convince Goma to emigrate, but he refused. As the police cordon got more relaxed, several more people signed the letter and they were arrested on exiting Goma's apartment.\n\nIn March, he wrote an even tougher admonitory letter to Ceaușescu, urging him not to break the bond between the people and him, a bond that was created after Ceaușescu condemned the invasion of Czechoslovakia, and attacked the Securitate whom Goma said were \"traitors and enemies of Romania, who produce nothing and prevent those who produce from producing more\". In the meantime, Goma gained the support of two intellectuals: psychiatrist Ion Vianu and literary critic Ion Negoiţescu; in all, he had 75 signatures.\n\nCalled by Cornel Burtică, the Secretary for Propaganda of the Central Committee, on March 12, Goma got the promise of being allowed to publish again, but he refused as he said that he wants not to be followed by the Securitate. A week later, a former boxer, Horst Stumpf, broke into Goma's flat and attacked him; the attacks repeated the following days. As he was barricading himself with some friends in his apartment, he gave an interview to French TV station Antenne 2.\n\nGoma was arrested and excluded from the Writers' Union of Romania. Following his arrest, he was attacked in the Romanian media: in a \"Săptămîna\" article, Eugen Barbu called him \"a nullity\", in \"Luceafărul\", Nicolae Dragoş said he was \"rousing reactionary elements\" and in \"Contemporanul\", Vasile Băran, not mentioning Goma, claimed that \"individuals calling themselves writers and journalists sully with the dirtiest of dirt our noble profession\".\n\nAn international appeal for his release was launched, among the signatories being Eugène Ionesco, Jean-Paul Sartre, Arthur Miller and Edward Albee. Goma was released on 6 May 1977, four days before the anniversary of 100 years of independence, celebrations which Ceaușescu didn't want overshadowed by Goma's arrest.\n\nOn November 20, 1977, Paul Goma and his family left Romania and went into exile in France.\n\nIn 1979, Paul Goma was active in the creation of the Free Workers' Syndicate.\n\nOn 3 February 1981, Paul Goma and Nicolae Penescu (former Interior Minister) received parcels in their post. Penescu opened his parcel to find a book and when he lifted its cover an explosion wounded him. Goma, who had received two death threats since his arrival in France, called the police. Both packages had been sent on instructions by Carlos the Jackal.\n\nIn 1982, the Securitate planned to assassinate Goma. Matei Haiducu, the secret agent sent by the Securitate to carry out the plan, turned to French counter-intelligence (DST). With the help of the DST, Haiducu simulated an attempt on Goma's life, by poisoning his drink at a restaurant; the drink was then spilled by a French agent, pretending to be a \"clumsy guest\".\n\nAlthough Goma's numerous works (both fiction and non-fiction) were translated worldwide, his books, except the first one, were published in Romania only after the 1989 Revolution. He now lives in Paris as a stateless political refugee, his Romanian citizenship having been revoked after 1978 by the communist government. He turned down an offer of citizenship from the French Republic, extended simultaneously to him and to the Czech writer Milan Kundera. In September 2006, a petition in favor of restoring his Romanian citizenship did not result in any progress on the issue.\n\nSome of Goma's post-2005 articles and essays have been criticized for their strong antisemitic nature. Goma rejects these criticisms and claims that he has filed libel lawsuits against his accusers. He asserts that his wife is Jewish and states that similar arguments were used against him by the Securitate in the 1980s. On January 30, 2007, Goma was awarded the \"Citizen of Honor\" distinction by the Municipal Council of Timişoara. In February 2007, the Federation of Jewish Communities of Romania and the Israeli Embassy protested against the distinction, arguing that Paul Goma is the author of multiple antisemitic articles.\n\nOn April 5, 2006 he was invited to become a member of the Tismăneanu Commission, a body charged with researching the crimes of the communist dictatorship in Romania. Nine days later he was dismissed by the Commission's president, Vladimir Tismăneanu, who explained the exclusion based on Goma's questioning the moral and scientific credibility of the president of the Commission, and disclosing of their private correspondence.\n\nGoma's literary debut came in 1966 with a short story published in the review \"Luceafǎrul\" with which he collaborated as well as with \"Gazeta literarǎ\", \"Viaţa românească\" and \"Ateneu\". In 1968 he published his first volume of stories, \"Camera de alături\" (\"The Room Next Door\"). After \"Ostinato\" and its West German publication in 1971 came \"Uşa\" (\"Die Tür\" or \"The Door\") in 1972, also in Germany. After his forced emigration in 1977 and until his books could again be published in Romania after the 1989 revolution, all his books appeared in France and in French. (His novel \"Gherla\" had in fact been published in 1976 first in French by Gallimard of Paris before he left Romania.) There followed such novels as \"Dans le cercle\" (\"Within the Circle\", 1977); \"Garde inverse\" (\"Reverse Guard\", 1979); \"Le Tremblement des Hommes\" (\"The Trembling of People\", 1979); \"Chassée-croisé\" (\"Intersection\", 1983); \"Les Chiens de la mort\" (\"The Dogs of Death\", 1981), which details his prison experiences in Piteşti in the 1950s; and \"Bonifacia\" (1986). The autobiographical \"Le Calidor\" appeared in French in 1987 and was subsequently published in Romanian as \"Din Calidor: O copilărie basarabeană\" (\"In Calidor: A Bessarabian Childhood\", 1989, 1990; translated as \"My Childhood at the Gate of Unrest\") in the Romanian émigré journal \"Dialog\", edited by Ion Solacolu.\n\nIn its totality, Goma's literary work comprises a \"persuasive and grimly fascinating exposure of totalitarian inhumanity\" from which, in his own case, even foreign exile was no guarantee of safe haven. In such later novels as \"Bonifacia\" and \"My Childhood at the Gate of Unrest\", the biographical element dominates as he focuses on his childhood and adolescence in Bessarabia. Several sets of diaries, all published in Romania in 1997 and 1998, shed light on Goma's later life and career: \"Alte Jurnale\" (\"Other Journals\"), which covers his stay in the United States in autumn 1978 but concentrates primarily on 1994-96; \"Jurnal I: Jurnal pe sărite\" (\"Journal I: By Leaps and Bounds\", 1997); \"Jurnal II: Jurnal de căldură mare\" (\"Journal II: Journal of Great Heat\", 1997), covering June and July 1989; \"Jurnal III: Jurnal de noapte lungă\" (\"Journal of the Long Night\", 1997), covering September to December 1993; and \"Jurnalul unui jurnal 1997\" (\"The Journal of a Journal, 1997\"), focusing just on that year.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The power of arrest can also be used to protect a person, or persons from harm or to protect damage to property.\n\nHowever, in many countries, a person also has powers of arrest under citizen's arrest or any person arrest powers.\n\nOriginally, powers of arrest were confined to sheriffs in England for a local area. Over the past few hundred years, the legal power of arrest has gradually expanded to include a large number of people/officials, the majority of which have come to the fore more recently. These various individuals all may utilise similar or different powers of arrest, but generally adhere to one particular field.\n\nThe individuals below have been listed in order of when the power of arrest became available to the individual, starting from the earliest.\n\nThe following individuals all have various powers of arrest or detention within England & Wales in various capacities using the following legislation/law:\n\nPolice Constables\n\nNational Crime Agency (formerly SOCA) officer\n\nPolice Community Support Officers (PCSOs)\n\nMembers of public (\"Other persons\" i.e. anyone who is not a constable)\n\nImmigration Officer (formerly UK Border Agency)\n\nHMRC Criminal Investigation Officers\n\nService Police (RMP/RAFP/RNP)\n\nPrison officers\n\nChurch Warden \n\nCourt bailiff\n\nCourt officer\n\nCourt security officer\n\nSheriff (Sheriffs Act 1887)\n\nSerjeant at Arms of the House of Commons\n\n\"Officer or agent\"\n\nEpping Forest Keepers (park rangers)\n\nEnvironment Agency officer\n\nWater bailiff\n\nIPCC investigators\n\nIn the United States, various law enforcement officers are able to legally arrest people.

{"id": "37927653", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37927653", "title": "Public service motivation", "text": "Public service motivation\n\nPublic Service Motivation (PSM) is an attribute of government and non-governmental organization (NGO) employment that explains why individuals have a desire to serve the public and link their personal actions with the overall public interest. Understanding the theory and practice of PSM is important in determining the motivations of individuals who choose careers in the government and non-profit sectors despite the potential for more financially lucrative careers in the private sector.\n\nPSM helps employees get the most out of their job experience and is rapidly evolving to work towards employee goals and company needs effectively. Efforts to manage employee behavior within government organizations by focusing on financial rewards may not have the desired effect and could potentially have a negative impact on employee motivation and performance seeing as how those that do work in the public sector are usually not motivated by financial gain. According to Perry, PSM in today's society is more about focusing on employee commitment to an organization rather than benefits of a higher salary. One way PSM output can be measured is by team performance which encourages individuals to engage in behaviors that are best for the team’s success and productivity. Performance can be measured in different categories and various outcomes can be utilized in order to help the organization set goals and interpret the results to tweak their motivational techniques. One area or aspect of management that relies heavily on motivation is when an organization or company determines how to distribute rewards to employees. Gottfredson emphasized that rewards may be the most important tool that business leaders have to coordinate and motivate team members with the idea that rewards can be monetary or promotional, but motivation plays a key part in how hard employees will work to receive rewards.\n\nPublic Service Motivation serves to provide the general public with an idea of what motivates individuals to choose career paths within the public sector as opposed to the private. Previous research emphasized that PSM was influenced by various social and political factors that ultimately drive employees to take an interest in the public sector. The history and concept of public service motivation has been studied by authors who contributed to the understanding of the practice itself such as Perry and Wise who coined the term PSM in 1990, and other political figures such as Woodrow Wilson who founded the field of Public Administration. Perry and Wise stated that PSM is often influenced by various social, political, and institutional factors and failure on the organization's part to recognize the motivation of its employees could lead to the discouragement of such individuals from the public sector.\n\nMission Valence can be viewed as an employee’s perception of the attractiveness or salience of an organization’s purpose or social contribution. Mission Valence is a concept formulated by Rainey and Steinbauer in 1999 that serves to provide a better understanding of what compels an employee to uphold and achieve goals within their organization. Mission Valence enhances the satisfaction that an individual experiences or anticipates to receive from advancing the organizational mission, and in turn, it has the \"potential to influence the ability of the organization to recruit, retain, and motivate its employees.\" Ultimately, linking the organization’s mission to the values and characteristics of the employee can increase the potential effects of PSM as members of the organization become committed to its success. Rainey and Steinbauer attribute mission valence to enhancing the satisfaction of an employee when the organization’s mission or goal is achieved thus giving the employer the ability to motivate his or her employees and seek their retention. With the desire to help others, public employees are more likely to seek employment within a public organization because the particular mission of that organization often aligns with their own personal values. Previous studies enhance the notion that leadership along with effective management can increase employee mission valence through its ability to promote public service motivation.\n\nTransformational leadership moves away from a traditional management perspective that is based on self-interest and the exchanging of rewards for positive performance, and instead proposes the ideology of value based leadership to inspire and thus motivate employees. Although value based leadership is not new to the scope of public management, it is important to understand the evolution of how employers communicate the vision of the organization’s purpose to their employees. Transformational leadership can motivate employees by appealing to their ideals and moral values, which in turn leads to a more effective and meaningful work environment. Transformational leaders create shared organizational value through \"inspirational communication, ongoing practices, setting meaningful goals and designating significant work.\" Paarlberg and Lavigna exclaim that linking transformational leadership and public service motivation to human resource management strategies will not radically improve the outcome of the workplace, but rather steadily transform management practices to garner the best organizational outcome to better motivate public sector employees.\n\nThe impact of organizational institutions can either have a positive or negative ramifications on the motivational attitude of employees. According to Perry and Wise, whose theories contributed to the understanding of the ongoing relationship between one's overall motivation and the public interest, provided the widely accepted definition of PSM as an individual’s \"predisposition to respond to motives grounded primarily or uniquely in public institutions and organizations.\" Under this definition, organizations have the duty and responsibility to foster an environment that allows employees to feel as if they are able to contribute to the general welfare of the public and can achieve their goals. Various scholars and researchers emphasize the role of organizations as an important aspect of PSM and indicate several factors that face employees on a regular basis that could either promote or hinder PSM. Perry and Wise specify those factors of an organization that influence PSM to include culture within an organization which can negatively be associated with PSM as hierarchical cultures tend to emphasize rule-based control of employees and bureaucratic personality, employees that experience red tape who often are characterized with lower levels of PSM as red tape includes rules regulations, and procedures that remain in force and entail a compliance burden, but do not advance the legitimate purposes the rules were intended to serve. Employees who had a lower level of job satisfaction were reported as more willing to tolerate red tape as opposed to those employees characterized with higher levels of PSM who were frustrated with the limitations of such constrictions. Educational level of organizational members reportedly had a positive relationship on the overall level of PSM of the individual. Wright, Pandey, and Moynihan emphasize that it is vital that organizational leaders understand the various factors that affect PSM in order help employees achieve their goals within the organization and provide for a better work environment.\n\nEarly authors in the field of public administration described differences between public and private employees and concerns over motivating public sector employees. Paul Van Riper described the issue in his 1952 history of the U.S. civil service system. Even Woodrow Wilson's seminal 1887 essay that founded the field of Public Administration expressed concern over the performance of civil servants. Much of Max Weber's work on bureaucracy focused on similar issues. Kaufman's \"The Forest Ranger\" introduced the idea of an organizational culture unique to government employees in the 1960s, which contributed significantly to the field of study.\n\nThe concept of Public Service Motivation was formalized in the late 1970s and early 1980s by authors like Buchanan, Mosher, Perry, Porter, and Rainey; but the term was officially coined by Perry and Wise in 1990. Since then, PSM has gained international prominence from various scholars and researchers. PSM varies between employees making it difficult to generalize the motivations of each individual who works in the public sector. Studies by Homberg, McCarthy, and Tabvuma attribute PSM to the positive impact on job satisfaction in the public sector because public employment helps satisfy individuals’ pro-social needs. Previous authors that are familiar with motivational factors associated with the public sector suggests that many employees tend to characterize themselves with pro-social identities such as caring and compassionate. Researchers of motivational theory and management emphasize that individuals will go above and beyond to be viewed as \"moral\" or good by their peers and fellow employees, so finding pro-social ways to motivate individuals can be beneficial.\n\nCrewson argued that a responsive and cost-effective government should acknowledge that a failure to properly understand the motivations of public employees may have undesirable short term effects such as low job performance which may lead to long term effects such as the permanent displacement of the public service ethic.\n\nRosenblatt noted that there is a surprising link between PSM and motivation. After closely observing employees in the public section, material indicated that when PSM encourages individuals it can spark innovation. When employees are rewarded for previous accomplishments in the workplace, they are motivated to do even more, although that motivation is not necessarily coming from a genuine place and instead comes from the desire to receive more rewards. Rosenblatt reaffirms the notion that individuals aren't to concern themselves with what their driving force for may be, whether they are making accomplishments because they want to be innovative or because they want to receive a bonus, the ends will ultimately justify the means.\n\nMatei and Cornea considered that although intrinsic, PSM is influenced by a variety of external factors such as social, political, institutional etc. and, in time, those factors can have an effect and lead to a change in the initial PSM of the individual that was present at the beginning of the position. Such factors demonstrate that if the external factors that act on the public servant are negative, PSM will influence the behavior of the individual for a period of time that is smaller than the professional career of that individual. If the extrinsic factors are positive, PSM can influence the behavior of the public servant throughout their entire career. Matei and Cornea concluded that during this period of time, when PSM influences the activity of the individual, the public servant is led by a certain “lyricism of public service\", and connected to their job by “administrative romanticism\" with the ultimate desire to serve their community, state, nation etc.\n\nMann also conducted a study among non profit employees and came to the conclusion that although there is a dichotomy within the public and private sectors, if an employee is working for a non profit organization he or she would be satisfied regardless of PSM or not. The reason behind this behavior is because employees who work for non profits already have a passion for the work that they do. According to Mann's study, even if these individuals didn't receive compensation, they would return to work the next day and work just as hard because they have intrinsic motivation that doesn't need to be externalized.\n\nPrevious scholars and researchers warn that PSM can also be influenced by negative factors such as institutionalized values, routinization of behaviors and skepticism about the value of the particular bureaucracy's effectiveness in promoting the public good. Budget maximization and \"empire building\" were also scrutinized by Downs and Niskanen.\n\nThe agency's mission, goals, and objectives can help improve employee performance and motivation. Many employees who hold jobs within the public sector and non-profit organizations do not receive large salaries. It is important for an organization to motivate its employees and align their values and characteristics with the mission and values of the agency rather than subject employees to a stressful and hostile work environment motivated by financial gain. Leadership practices should emphasize to employees the importance of motivation and involvement which can ultimately help the agency or organization in the hiring and retention process if they are aware of the motives of their employees.\n\nStudies performed by various researchers attribute an individual's motivation with the individual level of stress and job dissatisfaction. These factors can lead to surface acting which is characterized by adjusting observable emotional expressions to mask true feelings, pretending to feel a desired emotion, and faking emotional displays. It is hard to evaluate the motivation of each individual working in the public sector when they exhibit a false persona. Representing an agency or organization in the public sector often requires one to display and act in a certain behavior and attitude. This behavior often leads to surface acting.\n\nSituational factors such as the frequency of customer interactions, the duration of such interactions, career fields, customer hostility, and organizational expectations can all contribute to one's emotional labor. Emotional labor is the act of behaving or displaying specific emotions and behaviors within one's job profession. Employees are constantly under the influence of interactions between other employees and customers. Many citizens expect a certain level of satisfaction from each level of government which often burdens the employee with an immense amount of pressure to fulfill those expectations and who in turn will often face backlash and harsh criticism when citizens feel they are not satisfied.\n\nIf an employee finds themselves in a hostile, stressful work environment this can deter motivation and counteract productivity which can ultimately effect the individuals goals, expectations, and disrupt the balance of the workplace. Motivation stems from an individuals desire to satisfy the needs for automaton, direct communication between employees, and asocial inclusions. Having an open approach in the workplace can help new less experienced employees feel a sense of involvement and value which an ultimately increase their motivation to succeed and continue with the organization and vie for its success. As generational changes continue to occur and public sector employees rotate between positions, it is vital to understand how employment relationships can be improved in order to increase public service motivation. Nonprofit employees are becoming more similar to public employees based on motivational aspects such as intrinsic rewards.\n\n"}
{"id": "744648", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=744648", "title": "Seattle Liberation Front", "text": "Seattle Liberation Front\n\nThe Seattle Liberation Front, or SLF, was a radical anti-Vietnam War movement, based in Seattle, Washington, in the United States. The group, founded by then-University of Washington visiting philosophy professor and political activist Michael Lerner, carried out its protest activities from 1970 to 1971.\n\nThe most famous members of the SLF were the \"Seattle Seven\" — seven SLF members charged with \"conspiracy to incite a riot\" in the wake of a violent protest at a courthouse. The members of the Seattle Seven were Lerner himself, as well as Jeff Dowd, Joe Kelly, Susan Stern, Michael Abeles, Roger Lippman and Charles Marshall III.\n\nAfter the nationwide organization Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) disintegrated in 1969, Michael Lerner, an instructor newly arrived in Seattle from Berkeley, California, felt compelled to start up his own local group. He kick-started his efforts by inviting Jerry Rubin, a notable counterculture figure, to speak on the University of Washington campus on January 17, 1970 – two days later, the SLF was formed, largely composed of students and radicals coming out of organizations (like the SDS) that had recently disbanded. The exact impetus for Lerner seeking a new organization is somewhat vague. The founding of SLF came less than a month after SDS Weatherman, which had staged violent street demonstrations during the latter half of 1969, announced that it was going underground to adopt a strategy of random acts of bombing, arson, and other sabotage. It has not been explained whether or not Lerner was seeking a new organization prior to Weatherman's underground turn. One of the SLF's first actions was to hold a demonstration in support of the Chicago Seven, a group of radicals charged with inciting riots at the 1968 Democratic National Convention.\n\nThe relationship between the Weather Underground and the Seattle Liberation Front remains somewhat ambiguous. Both groups shared many of the same political viewpoints, where they participated in protests and demonstrations, and there was overlap in membership. The violent, confrontational style of protest at events sponsored by SLF was identical with that of the SDS Weatherman faction before the latter went underground at the end of 1969. There were no official ties between the Seattle Liberation Front and the Weather Underground, however, two of the Seattle Seven, Roger Lippman and Susan Stern, were also members of the Weather Underground along with fugitive SLF member Michael Justesen. Chip Marshall was one of the leading members of the Seattle Liberation Front. In an interview with Time magazine in 1980, Marshall commented on the takeover of the SDS by Weatherman, a violent radical left faction. He said Weatherman had established cultural standards to which members were to adhere. Marshall did not agree with destroying monogamy, cutting family ties, and devaluing personal relationships. SLF founder Michael Lerner was never known to be affiliated with the Weather Underground or to endorse its strategy of bombing and arson.\n\nSLF planned a demonstration to be held at the Federal Courthouse in downtown Seattle on February 17, 1970. It is commonly referred to by former SLF members as \"The Day After\" or \"TDA.\" The roughly 2,000 protesters in attendance escalated their protests into violence, throwing rocks and paint bombs at both the courthouse and at police responding to the scene. Twenty were injured in the riot, and 76 were arrested. Michael Lerner stated that it was a different sequence of events: \"when it [the demonstration] was attacked by police, it turned into a riot.\" In March 1970, the Seattle Liberation Front, UW Black Student Union, and the Weathermen organized hundreds of protesters at the University of Washington’s campus. The groups wanted the university to sever its athletic links with Brigham Young University, a Mormon school that was accused of racism. Seattle Liberation Front and Black Student Union supporters initiated a riot that moved through eleven buildings at the University of Washington’s Seattle campus. Around 200 chanting demonstrators left a trail of damage throughout the campus. Members of the SLF collective based at 814 South Weller Street spoke at a design hearing for the then-proposed I-90 freeway in June 1970, denouncing the project as \"racist\" and advocating revolution.\n\nTwo months later, on April 16, a federal grand jury indicted members of the SLF on charges of inciting the February 17 riot - Lerner was charged with \"using the facilities of interstate commerce [a telephone] with the intent of inciting to riot,\" but he was not charged with \"inciting to riot.\" (One of the eight, Michael Justesen, disappeared but was later arrested in California by the FBI in an infiltration of the Weathermen). Federal District Judge George Boldt was assigned the case, which began in his Tacoma courtroom on November 6, 1970. The trial was quickly derailed by the defendants' vocal disruptions, a protest walkout, and their eventual refusal to enter the courtroom. Boldt declared a mistrial on December 10, citing all defendants for contempt of court. He summarily found them guilty of contempt, sentenced them to six months in prison, and refused to grant bail. The defendants eventually served three months in prison.\n\nThe original charges of inciting a riot, or of intent to incite to riot, and conspiracy to damage the Seattle Federal Building, were unsuccessfully prosecuted. Lerner stated the reason for the failure to win a conviction was \"because it was revealed that the FBI agents who were infiltrating the anti-war organization were themselves the people who had precipitated the violence.\" Most observers agreed that the prosecution's case was floundering (aided by the admission of government witnesses on the stand that they would \"go to any length\" to combat the radicals. It is believed by some that the Seattle Seven would have been freed if some of them had not provoked the elderly judge with catcalls during the proceedings.\n\nDue to the publicity of the trial, the Seattle Liberation Front faced ideological dissension, personality conflicts, and charges of \"male chauvinism.\" In the fall of 1970 SLF sponsored a short-lived weekly underground newspaper, \"Sabot\", which folded in December after a three-month run amid political infighting among the staff. In late 1971, the SLF was disbanded. Many of the individual SLF members continued to promote diverse social movements, such as Capitol Hill's Country Doctor Clinic. Lerner, the founder of SLF, eventually became the editor of \"Tikkun\" and an advisor to President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton. Jeff Dowd went to Hollywood to become a screenwriter and producer. Chip Marshall remained active in Washington politics, running for Seattle City Council in 1975 and working as a neighborhood activist in Issaquah.\n\nIn the movie \"The Big Lebowski\", the main character Jeffrey \"The Dude\" Lebowski says, \"Did you ever hear of the Seattle Seven? That was me ... and six other guys.\" This refers to Jeff Dowd's involvement in the Seattle Seven, who was a friend of the Coen brothers and the inspiration for the character \"The Dude\".\n\n\n"}

Smith's parents, after being informed that the assailant's activity constituted, at most, a misdemeanor offense, advocated stronger penalties, to prevent future incidents of this kind.\n\nTheir campaign took them all over Arizona, and their efforts were supported by city councils of medium-sized Arizona cities such as Tucson. Then-Governor Jane Hull also joined them in their cause. After the Arizona legislature failed to pass the law twice in 1999, it finally received both state senate and state house approval in April 2000, and was enacted in that July. The NRA supported the law and worked in cooperation to form the 'Shannon's Law'\n\nViolation of \"Shannon's law\" is defined as a felony offense in Arizona. However, as with most felony offenses in United States jurisdictions, a person charged with this offense can strike a plea bargain with prosecutors, and may be eligible for only a misdemeanor conviction. The decision of whether such an offer is available lies solely in the hands of the prosecutor, and presently these offenses are being charged as \"dangerous\" offenses, thereby making the accused ineligible for probation under state law, requiring a prison sentence even for a first offense.\n\nOn December 31, 2003, police in the city of Glendale began using equipment which alerted them to the location from which a shot was fired. As random discharge of firearms are common in some areas of the United States on New Year's Eve, Fourth of July, and other holidays, four arrests of \"Shannon's law\" violators were made that night, and it is expected that more Arizona police departments will receive similar equipment.\n\nShannon Smith had been an award-winning athlete and honor student, and had graduated from the eighth grade a few weeks prior to her death. While she stood in her backyard talking on the telephone with a friend, a stray bullet hit her in her head, causing instant death. Smith's death sparked a furor among Arizona residents. Her funeral was attended by approximately 1,300 people. A monument, made with melted metal from confiscated firearms, was raised in her honor at her middle school by her classmates and friends. Tens of thousands of dollars in donations for the monument were primarily raised by Shannon's friends and classmates holding car washes.\n\nAfter being informed by the police that random discharge of firearms was a simple misdemeanor, Smith's parents resolved to change the laws and ran a statewide campaign advocating harsher punishment for random shooters. Their campaign gained support from such people as then-Governor Jane Dee Hull. In April 2000, \"Shannon's law\" was passed.\n\n"}

Most crimes that have statutes of limitations are distinguished from serious crimes as these may be brought at any time.\n\nIn civil law systems, similar provisions are typically part of their civil or criminal codes and known collectively as \"periods of prescription\".

Within countries and states, the statute of limitations may vary from one civil or criminal action to another. Some nations have no statute of limitations whatsoever.\n\nAnalysis of a statute of limitations also requires the examination of any associated statute of repose, tolling provisions, and exclusions.\n\nCommon law legal systems can include a statute specifying the length of time within which a claimant or prosecutor must file a case. In some civil jurisdictions (e.g., California), a case cannot begin after the period specified, and courts have no jurisdiction over cases filed after the statute of limitations has expired. In some other jurisdictions (e.g., New South Wales, Australia), a claim can be filed which may prove to have been brought outside the limitations period, but the court will retain jurisdiction in order to determine that issue, and the onus is on the defendant to plead it as part of their defence, or else the claim will not be statute barred.\n\nOnce filed, cases do not need to be resolved within the period specified in the statute of limitations.\n\nThe purpose and effect of statutes of limitations are to protect defendants. There are three reasons for their enactment: \n\nIn Classical Athens, a five-year statute of limitations was established for all cases except homicide and the prosecution of non-constitutional laws (which had no limitation). Demosthenes wrote that these statutes of limitations were adopted to control \"sycophants\" (professional accusers).\n\nThe limitation period generally begins when the plaintiff's cause of action accrues, meaning the date upon which the plaintiff is first able to maintain the cause of action in court, or when the plaintiff first becomes aware of a previous injury (for example, occupational lung diseases such as asbestosis).\n\nA statute of repose limits the time within which an action may be brought based upon when a particular event occurred (such as the completion of construction of a building or the date of purchase of manufactured goods), and does not permit extensions. A statute of limitations is similar to a statute of repose, but may be extended for a variety of reasons (such as the minority of the victim).\n\nFor example, most U.S. jurisdictions have passed statutes of repose for construction defects. If a person receives an electric shock due to a wiring defect that resulted from the builder's negligence during construction of a building, the builder is potentially liable for damages if the suit is brought within the time period defined by the statute, normally starting with the date that construction is substantially completed. After the statutory time period has passed, without regard to the nature or degree of the builder's negligence or misconduct, the statute of repose presents an absolute defense to the claim.\n\nStatutes of repose are sometimes controversial; manufacturers contend that they are necessary to avoid unfair litigation and encourage consumers to maintain their property. Alternatively, consumer advocates argue that they reduce incentives to manufacture durable products and disproportionately affect the poor, because manufacturers will have less incentive to ensure low-cost or \"bargain\" products are manufactured to exacting safety standards.\n\nMany jurisdictions suspend, or toll, the limitation period under certain circumstances such as if the aggrieved party (plaintiff) was a minor or filed a bankruptcy proceeding. In those instances, the running of limitations is tolled, or paused, until the condition ends. Equitable tolling may also be applied if an individual may intimidate a plaintiff into not reporting or has been promised a suspended period.\n\nThe statute of limitations may begin when the harmful event, such as fraud or injury, occurs or when it is discovered. The US Supreme Court has described the \"standard rule\" of when the time begins as \"when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action.\" The rule has existed since the 1830s. A \"discovery rule\" applies in other cases (including medical malpractice), or a similar effect may be applied by tolling.\n\nAs discussed in \"Wolk v. Olson\", the discovery rule does not apply to mass media such as newspapers and the Internet; the statute of limitations begins to run at the date of publication. In 2013, the US Supreme Court of the United States unanimously ruled in \"Gabelli v. SEC\" that the discovery rule does not apply to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's investment-advisor-fraud lawsuits since one of the purposes of the agency is to root out fraud.\n\nIn private civil matters, the limitations period may generally be shortened or lengthened by agreement of the parties. Under the Uniform Commercial Code, the parties to a contract for sale of goods may reduce the limitations period to one year but not extend it.\n\nLimitation periods that are known as laches may apply in situations of equity; a judge will not issue an injunction if the requesting party waited too long to ask for it. Such periods are subject to broad judicial discretion.\n\nFor US military cases, the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) states that all charges except those facing court-martial on a capital charge have a five-year statute of limitations. If the charges are dropped in all UCMJ proceedings except those headed for general court-martial, they may be reinstated for six months after which the statute of limitations has run out.\n\nIn civil law countries, almost all lawsuits must be brought within a legally-determined period known as \"prescription\". Under Italian and Romanian law, criminal trials must be ended within a time limit.\n\nIn criminal cases, the public prosecutor must lay charges within a time limit which varies by jurisdiction and varies based on the nature of the charge; in many jurisdictions, there is no statute of limitations for murder. Over the last decade of the 20th century, many United States jurisdictions significantly lengthened the statute of limitations for sex offenses, particularly against children, as a response to research and popular belief that a variety of causes can delay the recognition and reporting of crimes of this nature.\n\nCommon triggers for suspending the prescription include a defendant's fugitive status or the commission of a new crime. A criminal may be convicted \"in absentia\". Prescription should not be confused with the need to prosecute within \"a reasonable delay\" as obligated by the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nUnder international law, genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes are usually not subject to the statute of limitations as codified in a number of multilateral treaties. States ratifying the Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity agree to disallow limitations claims for these crimes. In Article 29 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes \"shall not be subject to any statute of limitations\".\n\nThe Limitations Act of 1958 allows 12 years for victims of child abuse to make a claim, with age 37 the latest at which a claim can be made. The police submitted evidence to a commission, the Victorian Inquiry into Church and Institutional Child Abuse (in existence since 2012) indicating that it takes an average of 24 years for a survivor of child sexual abuse to go to the police. According to Attorney General Robert Clark, the government will remove statutes of limitations on criminal child abuse; survivors of violent crime should be given additional time, as adults, to deal with the legal system. Offenders of minors and the disabled have used the statute of limitations to avoid detection and prosecution, moving from state to state and country to country; an example presented to the Victorian Inquiry was the Christian Brothers.\n\nAn argument for abolishing statutes of limitations for civil claims by minors and people under guardianship is ensuring that abuse of vulnerable people would be acknowledged by lawyers, police, organisations and governments, with enforceable penalties for organisations which have turned a blind eye in the past. Support groups such as SNAP Australia, Care Leavers Australia Network and Broken Rites have submitted evidence to the Victoria inquiry, and the Law Institute of Victoria has advocated changes to the statute of limitations.\n\nFor crimes other than summary conviction offences, there is no statute of limitations in Canadian criminal law. For indictable (serious) offences such as major theft, murder, kidnapping or sexual assault, a defendant may be charged at any future date; in some cases, warrants have remained outstanding for more than 20 years.\n\nCivil law limitations vary by province, with Ontario introducing the Limitations Act, 2002 on January 1, 2004.\n\nIn Germany, the statute of limitations on crimes varies by type of crime, with the highest being 30 years for voluntary manslaughter (Totschlag). Murder, genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and crime of aggression have no statute of limitations.\n\nMurder used to have 20 years' statute of limitations, which was then extended to 30 years in 1969. The limitations were abolished altogether in 1979, to prevent Nazi criminals from avoiding criminal liability.\n\nFor most other criminal offences, the statute of limitations is set by Section 78(3) of the Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch) as follows:\n\n\nIn the civil code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch), the regular statute of limitations is three years (plus the time until the end of the calendar year). However, different terms between two and thirty years may apply in specific situations. For example, the term is only two years for claims for alleged defects of purchased goods, but 30 years for claims resulting from a court judgement (such as awarded damages).\n\nThe statute of limitations in India is defined by the Limitations Act, 1963.\n\nThe statute of limitations for criminal offences is governed by Sec. 468 of the Criminal Procedure Code.\n\nThe statute of limitations on murder was abolished by a change in law on 1 July 2014, causing any murders committed after 1 July 1989 to have no statute of limitations. This led to the national police force implementing a new investigation group for old cases called the \"Cold Case\" group. The law was also changed to let cases involving domestic violence, forced marriage, human trafficking and genital mutilation to count from the day the defendant turns 18 years old. Cases where the statute of limitations has already passed can not be extended due to the constitution preventing it.\n\nIn July 2015, the National Assembly abolished a 25-year-old statute on first degree murder; it had previously been extended from 15 to 25 years in December 2007.\n\nUnlike other European countries, the United Kingdom has no statute of limitations for any criminal offence. Following a number of acquittals and wrongful convictions of people charged with serious sexual crimes alleged to have been committed several decades prior, there has been some debate as to whether there should be a statute of limitations for historical rape and sexual assault cases, as prosecutions rely solely on personal testimonies and have no physical or scientific evidence due to the passage of time.\n\nIn the United States, statutes of limitations may apply to both civil lawsuits and to criminal prosecutions. Statutes of limitations vary significantly between U.S. jurisdictions.\n\nA civil statute of limitations applies to a non-criminal legal action, including a tort or contract case. If the statute of limitations expires before a lawsuit is filed, the defendant may raise the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense to seek dismissal of the charge.\n\nA criminal statute of limitations defines a time period during which charges must be initiated for a criminal offense. If a charge is filed after the statute of limitations expires, the defendant may obtain dismissal of the charge.\n\nThe statute of limitations in a criminal case only runs until a criminal charge is filed and a warrant is issued, even if the defendant is a fugitive.\n\nWhen the identity of a defendant is not known, some jurisdictions provide mechanisms to initiate charges and thus stop the statute of limitations from running. For example, some states allow an indictment of a \"John Doe\" defendant based upon a DNA profile derived from evidence obtained through a criminal investigation. Although rare, a grand jury can issue an indictment in absentia for high-profile crimes to get around an upcoming statute of limitations deadline. One example is the skyjacking of Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 305 by D.B. Cooper in 1971. The identity of D. B. Cooper remains unknown to this day, and he was indicted under the name \"John Doe, aka Dan Cooper.\" \n\nCrimes considered heinous by society have no statute of limitations.\nAlthough there is usually no statute of limitations for murder (particularly first-degree murder), judges have been known to dismiss murder charges in cold cases if they feel the delay violates the defendant's right to a speedy trial. For example, waiting many years for an alibi witness to die before commencing a murder trial would be unconstitutional. In 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court in \"Stogner v. California\" ruled that the retroactive extension of the statute of limitations for sexual offenses committed against minors was an unconstitutional \"ex post facto\" law.\n\nUnder the U.S. Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), desertion has no statute of limitations.\n\nMaritime Injury Law\n\nUnder 46 U.S. Code § 30106, \"Except as otherwise provided by law, a civil action for damages for personal injury or death arising out of a maritime tort must be brought within 3 years after the cause of action arose.\" There are some exceptions to this, primarily with regard to Jones Act cases filed against the government, in which case the statute of limitations can be less than 2 years. \n\nU.S. jurisdictions recognize exceptions to statutes of limitation that may allow for the prosecution of a crime or civil lawsuit even after the statute of limitations would otherwise have expired. Some states stop the clock for a suspect who is not residing within the state or is purposely hiding. Kentucky, North Carolina, and South Carolina have no statutes of limitation for felonies, while Wyoming includes misdemeanors as well. However, the right to speedy trial may derail any prosecution after many years have passed.\n\nWhen an officer of the court is found to have fraudulently presented facts to impair the court's impartial performance of its legal task, the act (known as \"fraud upon the court\") is not subject to a statute of limitation. Officers of the court include lawyers, judges, referees, legal guardians, parenting-time expeditors, mediators, evaluators, administrators, special appointees and any others whose influence is part of the judicial mechanism. Fraud upon the court has been defined by the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals to \"embrace that species of fraud which does, or attempts to, defile the court itself, or is a fraud perpetrated by officers of the court so that the judicial machinery cannot perform in the usual manner its impartial task of adjudging cases that are presented for adjudication\". In \"Bulloch v. United States\", the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled: \"Fraud upon the court is fraud which is directed to the judicial machinery itself and is not fraud between the parties or fraudulent documents, false statements or perjury ... It is where the court or a member is corrupted or function—thus where the impartial functions of the court have been directly corrupted.\"\n\nIn tort law, if a defendant commits a series of illegal acts against another person (or in criminal law if someone commits a continuing crime) the limitation period may begin to run from the last act in the series. In the 8th Circuit case of \"Treanor v. MCI Telecommunications, Inc.\", the court explained that the continuing-violations doctrine \"tolls [freezes] the statute of limitations in situations where a continuing pattern forms due to [illegal] acts occurring over a period of time, as long as at least one incident ... occurred within the limitations period.\" Whether the continuing-violations doctrine applies to a particular violation is subject to judicial discretion; it was ruled to apply to copyright infringement in \"Taylor v. Meirick\" (712 F.2d 1112, 1119; 7th Cir. 1983) but not in \"Stone v. Williams\" (970 F.2d 1043, 1049–50; 2d Cir. 1992).\n\n"}

{"id": "30561", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30561", "title": "Tallage", "text": "Tallage\n\nTallage or talliage (from the French \"tailler, i.e. \" a part cut out of the whole) may have signified at first any tax, but became in England and France a land use or land tenure tax. Later in England it was further limited to assessments by the crown upon cities, boroughs, and royal domains. In effect, tallage was a land tax.\n\nLand taxes were not unknown in England, as the Anglo-Saxon kings had periodically levied a Danegeld on that basis, but tallage was brought to England by the Normans as a feudal duty. Under the sons of Henry II it became a common source of royal revenue. It was condemned in the Magna Carta of 1215, and was abolished in England in 1340 under Edward III.\n\nLike scutage, tallage was superseded by the subsidy system in the 14th century. The last occasion on which tallage was levied in England appears to be about the year 1332.\n\nThe famous statute of \"25 Edw. I.\" (in some editions of the statutes \"34 Edw. I.\"), \"De Tallagio non Concedendo\", though it is printed among the statutes of the realm, and was cited as a statute in the preamble to the Petition of Right in 1628, and by the judges in John Hampden's case in 1637, is probably an imperfect and unauthoritative abstract of the \"Confirmatio Cartarum\". The first section enacts that no tallage for aid shall be imposed or levied by the king and his heirs without the will and assent of the archbishops, bishops, and other prelates, the earls, barons, knights, burgesses, and other freemen in the kingdom.\n\n\"Tallagium facere\" was the technical term for rendering accounts in the exchequer, the accounts being kept by means of \"tallies\" or notched sticks. The tellers (a corruption of \"talliers\") of the exchequer were at one time important financial officers. The system of keeping the national accounts by tallies was abolished by \"23 Geo. III. c. 82\" and the office of teller by \"57 Geo. II. c. 84\".\n\nThe tax was frequently levied on English Jews during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. A tallage of £60,000, known as the \"Saladin tallage\", was levied at Guildford in 1189, the ostensible object being preparation for the Third Crusade. It was reported that John may have imposed a Tallage upon Jews in 1210 to the extent of 60,000 marks (£40,000). There are likewise records of tallages under Henry III of 4,000 marks (1225) and 5,000 marks (1270). Important tallages were made by Edward I in the second, third and fourth years, (£1,000) and in the fifth year (25,000 marks), of his reign. These taxes were in addition to the various claims which were made upon Jews for relief, wardship, marriage, fines, law-proceedings, debts, licenses, amercements etc. and which Jews paid to the English exchequer, like other English subjects. It has been claimed that after their expulsion from England in 1290, the loss of the income from Jews was a chief reason why Edward I was obliged to give up his right of tallage upon Englishmen.\n\nTallage lasted much longer in France, where it was a royal tax and one of estate owners with tenants. It came to be called 'taille' and was much used during the Hundred Years' War. It was not abolished in France until the French Revolution.\n\nTallage never became significantly developed in the German states. It remained a small tax owed to a feudal lord in lieu of other feudal duties, dying out along with other feudal duties.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "52758825", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52758825", "title": "Targeted surveillance", "text": "Targeted surveillance\n\nTargeted surveillance (or targeted interception) is a form of surveillance that is targeted on specific persons of interest and distinguished from mass surveillance (or bulk interception). Untargeted surveillance is routinely accused of treating innocent people as suspects in ways that are unfair, of violating human rights, international treaties and conventions as well as national laws and of failing to pursue security effectively.\n\nA 2014 report to the UN General Assembly by the United Nations' top official for counter-terrorism and human rights condemned mass electronic surveillance as a clear violation of core privacy rights guaranteed by multiple treaties and conventions and makes a distinction between \"targeted surveillance\" - which \"depend[s] upon the existence of prior suspicion of the targeted individual or organization\" — and \"mass surveillance\", by which \"states with high levels of Internet penetration can [...] gain access to the telephone and e-mail content of an effectively unlimited number of users and maintain an overview of Internet activity associated with particular websites\".\n\nThe United Kingdom's House of Lords also distinguishes between these two broad types of surveillance:\nOnly targeted interception of traffic and location data in order to combat serious crime, including terrorism, is justified, according to a decision by the European Court of Justice.\n\n\nThe current approach of the NSA and its related organizations is attempting to collect all signals of everybody at all times without any prior selection. So any current selection is only used for targets of special interest, human review or special resource allocation.\n\nSuch selectors include searching the web for the privacy-enhancing software tools such as Tor.\n\nA leaked document revealed that for the XKeyscore program using language out of place for the region one is in, using encryption and searching the web for 'suspicious stuff' were suggested as selectors.\n\nSelectors for who to surveil and for what to look for in searches for unknown threats as well as their extents can be decided upon by society. Verifiable public consent on broad selectors and their extents as well as proper mechanisms and institutions for oversight may allow for a better cooperation of private sectors and citizens with their intelligence communities.\n\nIn Operation Eikonal German BND agents received \"Selector Lists\" − search terms for their dragnet surveillance. They contain IP addresses, mobile phone numbers and email accounts with the BND surveillance system containing hundreds of thousands and possibly more than a million such targets. These lists have been subject of controversy as in 2008 it was revealed that they contained some terms targeting the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS), the Eurocopter project as well as French administration, which were first noticed by BND employees in 2005. Other selectors were found to target the administration of Austria. After the revelations made by whistleblower Edward Snowden the BND decided to investigate the issue whose October 2013 conclusion was that at least 2,000 of these selectors were aimed at Western European or even German interests which has been a violation of the Memorandum of Agreement that the US and Germany signed in 2002 in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks. After reports emerged in 2014 that EADS and Eurocopter had been surveillance targets the Left Party and the Greens filed an official request to obtain evidence of the violations.\n\nThe BND's project group charged with supporting the NSA investigative committee in German parliament set up in spring 2014, reviewed the selectors and discovered 40,000 suspicious search parameters, including espionage targets in Western European governments and numerous companies. The group also confirmed suspicions that the NSA had systematically violated German interests and concluded that the Americans could have perpetrated economic espionage directly under the Germans' noses. The investigative parliamentary committee was not granted access to the NSA's selectors list as an appeal led by opposition politicians failed at Germany's top court - instead the ruling coalition appointed an administrative judge, Kurt Graulich, as a \"person of trust\" who was granted access to the list and briefed the investigative commission on its contents after analyzing the 40,000 parameters. In his almost 300-paged report Graulich concluded that European government agencies were targeted massively and that Americans hence broke contractual agreements. He also found that German targets which received special protection from surveillance of domestic intelligence agencies by Germany's Basic Law (Grundgesetz) − including numerous enterprises based in Germany − were featured in the NSA's wishlist in a surprising plenitude. While the magnitude differs there have also been problematic BND-internal selectors which have been used until end of 2013 - around two thirds of 3300 targets were related to EU and NATO states. Klaus Landefeld, member of the board at the Internet industry association Eco International, has met intelligence officials and legislators to present suggestions for improvement, like streamlining the selector system.\n\nFormer NSA director and whistleblower William Binney testified that while targeted data collection operations could help prevent terror attacks, \"overcollection\" of mass data undermined security and had consistently cost lives because of \"analysis paralysis\". He said the UK government should \"redirect\" intelligence agencies and law enforcement to targeted surveillance with it being \"based on probable cause and developing knowledge about the targets and make sure they qualify for things like warrants\". He also states that \"retroactively analysing people, anybody you want, any time you want, that's certainly possible with bulk acquisition of data but that's certainly not what democracies are built on\". According to him \"that's what totalitarian states are built on\".\n\nIn November 2016 whistleblower Edward Snowden states:\nSnowden also noted that the men who committed recent terrorist attacks in France, Canada and Australia were under surveillance but they weren't singled out.\nIn May 2015 \"The Intercept\" revealed that it obtained documents that showed that officials inside the NSA have criticized the 'collect it all'-approach as well with the documents having titles such as \"Data Is Not Intelligence\", \"The Fallacies Behind the Scenes\", \"Cognitive Overflow?\", \"Summit Fever\", \"In Praise of Not Knowing\", \"Dealing With a 'Tsunami' of Intercept\", \"Overcome by Overload?\" and \"Too Many Choices\".\n\nThe documents feature conclusions such as:\nThe SIGINT mission is far too vital to unnecessarily expand the haystacks while we search for the needles. Prioritization is key.\nWe in the agency are at risk of a similar, collective paralysis in the face of a dizzying array of choices every single day\n'Analysis paralysis' isn’t only a cute rhyme. It's the term for what happens when you spend so much time analyzing a situation that you ultimately stymie any outcome [...] It's what happens in SIGINT when we have access to endless possibilities, but we struggle to prioritize, narrow, and exploit the best ones.\n\nUnited Kingdom's Liberal Democrats have demanded that the Government ends indiscriminate mass surveillance and introduces a more targeted and effective counter-terrorism policy that uses targeted surveillance of specific individuals who are suspected of wrongdoing. Liberal Democrats home affairs spokesperson Alistair Carmichael asks that \"mass spying on the British people should be replaced with targeted surveillance of specific individuals suspected of wrongdoing\".\n\nIn the 2015 \"Resolution 2045\" the European Parliamentary Assembly \"recognises the need for effective, targeted surveillance of suspected terrorists and other organised criminal groups\" and states that \"such targeted surveillance can be an effective tool for law enforcement and crime prevention\", while at the same time \"according to independent reviews carried out in the United States, mass surveillance does not appear to have contributed to the prevention of terrorist attacks, contrary to earlier assertions made by senior intelligence officials. Instead, resources that might prevent attacks are diverted to mass surveillance, leaving potentially dangerous persons free to act\".\n\nPrivacy campaigners argue that instead of \"wasting resources gathering and sifting through the volume of data being accumulated through mass surveillance\", resources would be better allocated in providing more personnel for targeted surveillance.\n\nIn an analysis of 10 recent terror attacks Ryan Gallagher of \"The Intercept\" concludes that \"if any lesson can be learned from studying the perpetrators of recent attacks, it is that there needs to be a greater investment in conducting targeted surveillance of known terror suspects and a move away from the constant knee-jerk expansion of dragnet surveillance, which has simply not proven itself to be effective, regardless of the debate about whether it is legal or ethical in the first place\".\n\nAfter Privacy International launched a legal case against Britain's security services Thomas de la Mare QC of the group states there is a danger that \"de facto constant surveillance\" such as the services' orders for bulk data from telecom companies on request could become \"the most potent instrument of repression\" and argued during the hearing, that such non-targeted forms of surveillance have turned investigations on their head. The campaigners argue that whereas in the past, individual inquiries based on suspicion would throw up leads, it is now algorithmic processing of data providing those leads with that amounting to mass surveillance.\n\nCivil rights group Liberty, which is challenging the legality of bulk collection in the European Court of Human Rights criticizes the \"Report of the bulk powers review\" by David Anderson QC for failing to answer whether information gathered via bulk powers was the \"critical factor in preventing or detecting serious crime, and whether that information could have been obtained from smart, targeted surveillance instead\".\n\nLord Paddick comments the 2016 Investigatory Powers Act, saying \"as with any legislation, there is a significant risk that authorities will use powers in a way that parliament never intended\" and called for proper oversight to ensure any surveillance is targeted and proportionate.\nPrivacy campaigners say the bill clearly lays out the mass surveillance powers that would be at the disposal of the security services, and want it amended so that the surveillance is targeted and based on suspicion and argue that the powers are so sweeping, and the bill's language so general, that not just the security services but also government bodies will be able to analyse the records of millions of people even if they are not under suspicion.\n\nTroy Wolverton notes that the documents leaked by Snowden revealed widespread abuses, both at home and abroad. He says that \"instead of targeted surveillance of particular threats, the NSA had a motto and mentality of 'collect it all' on everybody, the privacy of anyone involved be damned\".\n\nJo Glanville, editor of Index on Censorship and a member of the Ministry of Justice working party on libel reform, asserts that keeping the country safe does not entitle the government or the intelligence services to act without regards to our human rights and that \"it is possible to conduct targeted surveillance with effective oversight while according respect to all our rights\".\n\nComputer scientists at the University of Pennsylvania have developed an algorithmic framework for conducting targeted surveillance of individuals within social networks while protecting the privacy of \"untargeted\" digital bystanders that \"outputs a list of confirmed targeted individuals discovered in the network, for whom any subsequent action (e.g., publication in a most-wanted list, further surveillance, or arrest in the case of terrorism; medical treatment or quarantine in the case of epidemics) will not compromise the privacy of the protected\".\n\nIn January 2017 it was reported that German federal agencies are using a new program called \"Radar\", developed by the BKA and the University of Zürich, that aims to help evaluate the risk posed by persons. It includes a catalog of questions such as about the person's relationship to violence and access to weapons and takes into account data on past terrorists.\n\nThe crypto and security communities can make the Internet more secure by making population-wide surveillance technically or economically infeasible, understanding that modest amounts of targeted surveillance will always be technically and economically feasible.\n\nEdward Snowden notes that \"we're thwarting mass surveillance when we use encryption. We're not stopping targeted surveillance. Because even, again, if you have the most well-encrypted device in the world, if the government spends a million dollars to pay a hacker to exploit your phone personally, they will very likely succeed\".\n\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation claims that the NSA and its defenders are trying to pass off their mass surveillance as being authorized under Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act as \"targeted surveillance\" even though it includes the collection of the content of hundreds of millions of communications annually and the real-time search of billions more which according to them fits the definition \"mass surveillance\" under Section 702.\n\nFurthermore, the organization asks how the US government justified the Yahoo email scanning under FISA, asking whether the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has interpreted FISA – which authorizes targeted surveillance of certain foreigners' (such as spies or terrorists) communications – to mean that the government can conscript Yahoo into mass surveillance of all of its users' emails.\n\nAccording to documents obtained from Edward Snowden and published by Glenn Greenwald the NSA and GCHQ have been automating targeted operations, allowing for \"industrial scale exploitation\" that can potentially infect \"millions\" of machines with malware.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "160437", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=160437", "title": "The Who Sell Out", "text": "The Who Sell Out\n\nThe Who Sell Out is the third studio album by the British rock band the Who. It was released on 15 December 1967 by Track Records in the UK and Decca Records in the US. \n\nA concept album, \"The Who Sell Out\" is structured as a collection of unrelated songs interspersed with fake commercials and public service announcements. The album purports to be a broadcast by pirate radio station Radio London. The reference to \"selling out\" was an intended irony, as The Who had been making real commercials during that period of their career, some of which are included as bonus tracks on the remastered CD.\n\nThe album's release was reportedly followed by lawsuits due to the mention of real-world commercial interests in the \"faux\" commercials and on the album covers, and by the makers of the real jingles (Radio London jingles), who claimed the Who used them without permission. (The jingles were produced by PAMS Productions of Dallas, Texas, which created thousands of station ID jingles in the 1960s and 1970s). It was the deodorant company, Odorono, who took offence that Chris Stamp made a request for endorsement dollars. \"I Can See for Miles\" was released as a single and peaked at #10 in the UK and #9 in the US.\n\n\"The Who Sell Out\" has received widespread acclaim from critics, some of whom viewed it as The Who's best record. It has also frequently been featured on all-time lists of the best albums, including \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\", on which it ranked 113th.\n\nIn his book \"Maximum R & B\", Who confidant Richard Barnes claims to have come up with the idea of the band recording commercial jingles after their cover of the \"Batman\" theme appeared on the \"Ready Steady Who\" EP. Barnes posited the idea to Roger Daltrey, whose similar suggestions to Pete Townshend were allegedly met with derision. \n\nInitially, the band's follow-up to \"A Quick One\" was to be titled \"Who's Lily\" after their recent single \"Pictures of Lily.\" Early cuts such as a cover of \"Summertime Blues,\" the Coke jingles, and the instrumental \"Sodding About,\" showed the influence of Track Records label-mate Jimi Hendrix on Townshend's guitar playing.\n\nEven before the group had formed, the members of The Who had been profoundly influenced by rock n roll appearing on the radio. The BBC did not broadcast much music at the time, which was left to stations like Radio Luxembourg and then pirate radio stations such as Radio Caroline. By the end of 1966, The Who had achieved commercial success owing to the mod movement that made up a significant section of the group's early audience. However, the movement was fading, and the TV show \"Ready, Steady, Go\" that had boosted the group to fame, had been cancelled. The group started touring the US the following year, and started to achieve success with their live act. In summer 1967, the group's managers Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp suggested the band could create a concept album based on pirate radio and structure it in the same manner as that, or a typical US AM radio station. As pirate radio had been influential to mods, it was felt particularly appropriate to pay tribute to it. As well as the music, the inter-song announcements and jingles were a key component of radio, so it was decided to include a selection of humorous asides on the album. The Marine Broadcasting Offences Act came into effect at midnight on 14 August 1967, outlawing all pirate stations and strengthening the album's effect as a tribute. The aspect separated The Who from their contemporaries in the developing underground rock scene, both musically and stylistically.\n\nThe first song to be written specifically for the concept was \"Jaguar\", paying tribute to the car, which was quickly followed by an instrumental the group had recorded for Coca-Cola. \"Armenia City in the Sky\", was written by a friend of the band, John \"Speedy\" Keen. According to music critic Richie Unterberger, \"The Who Sell Out\" featured \"jubilant\" psychedelic pop music that veers between \"melodic mod pop and powerful instrumentation\", while Edna Gundersen from \"USA Today\" said the album's style was power pop.\n\nHaving finished touring the US, including an appearance at the Monterey Pop Festival, the group returned to the UK on 16 September to start recording. They made progress on the album for the next three weeks; the first song to be completed was the single, \"I Can See For Miles\", released the following month. By October, the group had also completed \"Armenia (City In The Sky)\", \"Early Morning Cold Taxi\" and \"Girl's Eyes\". \"Heinz Baked Beans\", \"Odorono\" and \"Top Gear\" had been completed mid-month, along with a series of linking adverts and jingles mostly recorded by Entwistle and Moon. \"Tattoo\", \"Odorono\" and \"Rael\" were completed by 20 October, while most of the remainder of the album was recorded in between live shows at the end of the month. \"Sunrise\", a solo Townshend piece, was the last piece to be recorded on 2 November. The album was mixed by Lambert and Damon Lyon-Shaw intermittently throughout November, coming up with a finished master on the 20th.\n\nThe cover is divided into panels featuring a photograph by David Montgomery of each of the band members, two on the front and two on the back. On the front is Pete Townshend applying Odorono brand deodorant from an oversized stick, and Roger Daltrey sitting in a bathtub full of Heinz baked beans (holding an oversized tin can of the same). Daltrey claims to have caught pneumonia after sitting for a prolonged period in the bathtub, as the beans had been frozen. On the back is Keith Moon applying Medac (a fictitious acne ointment) from an oversized tube, and John Entwistle in a leopard-skin \"Tarzan\" suit, squeezing a blonde woman in a leopard-skin bikini with one arm and a teddy bear with the other (an ad for the Charles Atlas course mentioned in one of the album's fake commercials).\n\nOriginal vinyl copies of \"Sell Out\" end with an audio oddity that repeats into a locked groove (In response to The Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\"). The music in the locked groove is a vocal chanting jingle for The Who's UK label Track Records.\n\nWhen the LP was released on Track Records in the UK in 1967 (Track 612 002 Mono & Track 613 002 Stereo), a poster was included inside the first 1000 copies (500 stereo and 500 mono). They came with a sticker on the front cover stating 'Free Psychedelic Poster Inside'. Because of their rarity, first pressings with poster and sticker have sold for more than £600. Included in the inner sleeve of the 1995 MCA CD reissue; the poster art of a butterfly initially intended as the LP cover was scrapped, and turned into the free poster.\n\nThe album was released in the UK on 15 December 1967. It reached #13 in the charts. The original release date of 17 November had been pushed back due to arguments about the running order. It was released in the US on 6 January 1968, reaching #48. The concept of the album hampered its commercial performance despite positive reviews, as its irony sat awkwardly with the serious ambitions of the underground music scene, and it was too specific to the mod scene's background for many younger pop fans.\n\nIn a contemporary review for \"Rolling Stone\", Jann Wenner called \"The Who Sell Out\" \"fantastic\" and praised its \"exquisite\" sense of humor and the Who's \"consummate\" musicianship, which includes \"wholly original\" instrumentation and cleverly placed electronic sounds. Robert Christgau, writing in \"Esquire\", said the album establishes the band as \"the third best not just in Britain but the world\", while citing \"Tattoo\" as the best song Townshend has \"ever written, worth the price of the album\". In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Richie Unterberger said that, \"on strictly musical merits, it's a terrific set of songs that ultimately stands as one of the group's greatest achievements.\" Sociomusicologist Simon Frith referred to it as a \"Pop art pop masterpiece\".\n\nIn 1995, \"The Who Sell Out\" was reissued by MCA Records with numerous outtakes and rejected jingles added to the end of the original album. In the liner notes for the reissue, Dave Marsh called it \"the greatest rock and roll album of its era\" and \"the Who's consummate masterpiece, the work that holds together most tightly as concept and realization\". Marsh believed the album's essence is \"most tightly linked to the glorious pop insanity that psychedelia and its aftermath destroyed forever.\" Reviewing the reissue in \"The Village Voice\", Christgau called it the Who's \"only great album\", feeling they had yet to \"take their pretensions seriously\", with nothing but good songs throughout, including the faux-ads and bonus tracks. It was also deemed the band's best work by Todd Hutlock from \"Stylus Magazine\", while \"Melody Maker\" said the record was a masterpiece because of its \"glorious celebration of pop as useless commodity and a commercially corrupted art form\" without degrading itself. \"Rolling Stone\" called it \"the most successful concept album ever\" in a 1999 review.\n\nAccording to Acclaimed Music, \"The Who Sell Out\" is the 234th most ranked record on critics' all-time lists. In 2003, it was placed at number 113 on \"Rolling Stone\"s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Mark Kemp, writing in \"The Rolling Stone Album Guide\" (2004), called it Townshend's first and best concept album and said that he \"successfully does what he would overdo\" in \"Tommy\" and \"Quadrophenia\": \"There's no fixed narrative to take away from the music. And the music is sensational\". In 2007, \"Rolling Stone\" included it on their list of the 40 essential albums of 1967 and stated, \"the Who's finest album exemplifies how pop this famously psychedelic year was.\" The album was reissued in 2009 as a two-disc deluxe edition, which Danny Kelly of \"Uncut\" magazine said was the \"definitive\" release of the Who's most \"entertaining\" and \"endearing\" album. In his review for eMusic, Lenny Kaye said that \"The Who Sell Out\" is a \"classic of prophetic pop art\" because of \"the concept of branding that has taken the place of record label patronage these days\".\n\nAll songs written by Pete Townshend, except where noted.

{"id": "1499364", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1499364", "title": "Unfair labor practice", "text": "Unfair labor practice\n\nAn unfair labor practice in US labor law refers to certain actions taken by employers or unions that violate the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 (49 Stat. 449) (also known as the NLRA and the Wagner Act after NY Senator Robert F. Wagner) and other legislation. Such acts are investigated by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).\n\nThe NLRB has the authority to investigate and remedy unfair labor practices, which are defined in Section 8 of the Act. In broad terms, the NLRB makes it unlawful for an employer to:\n\n\nThe Act similarly bars unions from:\n\n\nApplying this general language to the real world requires, in the words of Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, \"distinctions more nice than obvious\". The substantive law applied by the NLRB is described elsewhere under specific headings devoted to particular topics.\n\nNot every unfair act amounts to an unfair labor practice; as an example, failing to pay an individual worker overtime pay for hours worked in excess of forty hours in a week might be a violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act, but it is unlikely to amount to an unfair labor practice as well. Similarly, a violation of a collective bargaining agreement, standing alone, may not constitute an unfair labor practice unless the employer has not only violated the contract but repudiated all or part of it.\n\nWhile the employees of the NLRB may assist individuals in filing charges, the employees of the NLRB cannot file charges on their own. Under the Act, \"any person\" (except an employee of the Board) may file a charge with the NLRB.\n\nSuch charges must be filed and served within six months of the events that constitute the basis of the charge. This deadline may be extended in some cases, e.g., if the party fraudulently conceals its violations of the law. Charges may also be amended if done so within six months of the alleged violation.\n\nThe General Counsel of the NLRB is responsible for investigating unfair labor practice charges and making the decision whether to issue a complaint. This job is delegated to the Regional Director of the region of the NLRB in which the charge has been filed; the Regional Director in turn assigns it to an employee of the region. It is the responsibility of the charging party to identify the witnesses who can support its charge; should it fail to do so the Regional Director will typically dismiss the charge.\n\nThe Regional Director generally seeks to reach a decision as to whether to issue a complaint or to dismiss the charge within thirty days of the filing of the charge. The Region may also ask the charging party to amend its charge to eliminate unsupported claims in an otherwise meritorious charge or to add new claims uncovered by the Region in the course of its investigation.\n\nA party unsatisfied with the Regional Director's decision to dismiss its charge can appeal the dismissal to the office of the General Counsel. The General Counsel's decision to dismiss a charge is not subject to further appeal and cannot be challenged in court.\n\nIf the issues raised by an unfair labor practice charge could also be resolved through the grievance and arbitration procedure of the collective bargaining agreement covering these employees, then the General Counsel may defer the case to arbitration. In those cases the General Counsel does not dismiss the charge, but holds it in abeyance while the parties to the contract arbitrate their contractual dispute.\n\nIf the Region finds merit in the charge it will file a formal complaint setting out the violations of the law allegedly committed by the respondent. While the Act requires that the original unfair labor practice be filed within six months, there is no comparable statute of limitations for issuance of a complaint. The complaint may also be amended in some circumstances to include other alleged violations of the Act not specified in an unfair labor practice charge.\n\nThe Region will usually renew its attempts to settle the matter after it has made the decision to issue complaint but before it has actually done so. It can settle unfair labor practice charges unilaterally, i.e., without the agreement of the charging party.\n\nThe Board draws a distinction between formal and informal settlements, i.e., those that call for issuance of a formal Board order and those that do not. A party unhappy with the Regional Director's settlement of its unfair labor practice charges can appeal a formal settlement to the Board itself, which must approve any formal settlement in any case, but can only appeal an informal settlement to the General Counsel.\n\nThe Board will set aside an informal settlement agreement if the employer violates the agreement or commits other violations of the Act after the agreement. The Board can, by contrast, enforce a formal settlement like any other Board order by petitioning the Court of Appeals for an order enforcing it.\n\nThe Board will also accept non-Board settlements, in which the charging party withdraws its charge in return for promises from the other side. The Board is not, however, obliged to accept the parties' settlement agreement or to allow withdrawal of the charge.\n\nIf the General Counsel believes that there is cause to issue complaint, then he can seek injunctive relief from a federal district court under Section 10(j) of the Act. Injunctive relief is usually ordered when necessary to preserve the status quo pending the Board's decision on the complaint or to prevent employees from suffering irreparable harm. Any injunction lapses once the NLRB issues its decision.\n\nThe General Counsel does not have to prove that the allegations in the complaint are well-founded, but only that he has some evidence, together with an arguable legal theory, to support his claims. Even so, the General Counsel rarely uses this power to seek relief while complaints are pending, other than in secondary boycott cases, in which the Act commands the General Counsel to seek injunctive relief.\n\nIf the case is not settled following issuance of a complaint, then the case will proceed to hearing before an Administrative Law Judge of the NLRB. The Regional Director has the power to issue subpoenas for use by any party prior to the hearing; the Administrative Law Judge has that power once the hearing commences. The hearing is governed by the same rules of evidence that would apply in a federal court trial.\n\nThe General Counsel functions as the prosecutor in these proceedings. Just as only the General Counsel can decide whether to issue a complaint, the General Counsel has exclusive authority to decide what charges to pursue. Interested parties may, however, intervene in these proceedings to present evidence or offer alternative theories in support of the charges that the General Counsel has alleged and to seek additional or different remedies than those that the General Counsel has proposed.\n\nThe Administrative Law Judge issues a recommended decision, which becomes final if not appealed to the NLRB. While the Administrative Law Judge's credibility determinations are ordinarily given great weight by the Board, they are not binding on it. The Board likewise is free to substitute its own view of the law for that of the Administrative Law Judge and frequently reverses its own precedents.\n\nA party that is aggrieved by a decision of the NLRB can seek review by petitioning in the Court of Appeals. The Act gives parties a good deal of latitude as to which court they want to hear their case: either the Circuit in which the hearing was held or the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia or any Circuit in which one of the parties against whom the complaint was brought resides or does business. The NLRB, as a matter of policy, only petitions in the Circuit in which the hearing was held.\n\nThe NLRB's decisions are not self-executing: it must seek court enforcement in order to force a recalcitrant party to comply with its orders. The Court of Appeal reviews the Board's decision to determine if it is supported by substantial evidence and based on a correct view of the law.\n\nWhile the courts are obligated in theory to give deference to the NLRB's interpretation of the Act, they do not always do so. The court may direct the NLRB to reconsider its decision or reverse it outright if it is convinced that the Board is in error. The court may also reverse Board actions that it considers to be an abuse of the NLRB's discretion, typically in the choice of remedies to be applied.\n\nAny aggrieved party may also ask the Supreme Court to review a decision of the Court of Appeals. Such review by the Supreme Court is, however, discretionary and rarely granted.\n\nIf the Court of Appeals enforces the Board's order then the case will return to the Region for it to monitor the respondent's compliance. In those cases in which the Board's order requires payment of backpay, the Region will commence compliance proceedings if it is not able to resolve all disputes over the amount of backpay. These compliance proceedings are also held before an Administrative Law Judge, based on the compliance specification filed by the Region. The same procedural rights apply in these proceedings as in the earlier proceedings on the merits of the charge.\n\n\n\n"}

The Supreme Court upheld the Seventh Circuit's decision in a 5–4 opinion written by Samuel Alito, rejecting the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's interpretation of who counts as a supervisor. The case was important because it resolved a dispute between several different circuits.\n\nThe issue presented before the Court was:\n\nWhile working at Ball State University, Maetta Vance contended that Saundra Davis, a catering specialist, had made Vance’s life at work unpleasant through physical acts and racial harassment. Vance sued her employer, the university, for workplace harassment by a supervisor.\n\nTo win a lawsuit for harassment under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, it is necessary to show that the employer is negligent in responding to complaints about harassment. However, to win a lawsuit for harassment by a \"supervisor\", the employer does not have to be negligent because Title VII imputes the supervisor’s acts to the employer. Vance asserted that Davis was a supervisor; Ball State claimed the opposite.\n\nThe District Court and the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals had determined that Davis was not Vance’s supervisor, because Davis did not have the power to direct the terms and conditions of her employment.\n\nThe Court upheld the Seventh Circuit's interpretation in its decision issued on June 24, 2013.

The majority of the High Court held that because the President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration was appointed for seven years and not life as required by s 72 of the Constitution, the Arbitration Court could not exercise judicial powers of the Commonwealth.\n\nThe Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia applied to the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration for a penalty to be imposed on J W Alexander Ltd for the breach of an award. H. B. Higgins was appointed for life as a judge of the High Court, however his appointment as President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration was for seven years only. J W Alexander Ltd objected to the case being heard by the Court, arguing that the Court was not validly constituted because the President was not appointed for life.\n\nHiggins referred questions for the opinion of the High Court, by way of a stated case. Two primary issues arose in the case, whether the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration could validly exercise (1) judicial power of the Commonwealth and (2) the arbitration powers of the Commonwealth. In the High Court Owen Dixon represented the Waterside Workers' Federation while Hayden Starke appeared for J W Alexander Ltd.\n\nAt the time s 72 of the Constitution provided :The Justices of the High Court and of the other courts created by the Parliament:\n(i) shall be appointed by the Governor-General in Council;\n\n(ii) shall not be removed except by the Governor-General in Council, on an address from both Houses of the Parliament in the same session, praying for such removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity;\n\n(iii) shall receive such remuneration as the Parliament may fix; but the remuneration shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.\n\nThe case followed shortly after the Wheat Case where the High Court held that the seven year term mandated by s103 of the Constitution for members of the Inter-State Commission precluded that commission from exercising judicial powers of the Commonwealth.\n\nThe High Court was divided with the majority of judges agreeing as to the conclusions but for different reasons such that there was no majority opinion and the ratio decidendi is, in part, uncertain. The plurality opinion is found in the judgments of Isaacs, Powers and Rich JJ.\n\nA majority of judges, Griffith CJ, Barton, Isaacs, Powers and Rich JJ, held that the power to enforce awards, being convictions for offences and the imposition of penalties and punishments, are matters appertaining exclusively to judicial power. Because the power conferred by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904-1915 was part of the judicial power of the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration could only do so if the \"Arbitration Act\" complied with the requirements of a Chapter III court.\n\nBarton, Isaacs, Powers and Rich JJ held that any judge of a Chapter III court must be appointed for life, subject only to the removal powers in section 72(ii). The life appointment must be to the particular court, not just to a court. It followed that the appointment of the President for a term of seven years was contrary to s 72 of the Constitution.\n\nBecause the President was invalidly appointed, the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration could not exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth and the provisions conferring upon it the power to enforce its awards were, therefore, invalid.\n\nIsaacs & Rich JJ in their joint judgement held that the only power the Constitution gave the Governor-General with respect to judges under Chapter III was to appoint or, in limited circumstances, remove the judge from office. The Governor-General had no power to assign judicial duties.\n\nGriffith CJ agreed with the majority that a judge must be appointed for life, however his Honour dissented as to the conclusion, holding at p 448 that being the President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration was not a separate judicial office, as it conferred no additional remuneration nor any personal right or advantage. As such the Governor-General was assigning these judicial duties to one of the Justices of the High Court and it was not an appointment under section 72 of the Constitution.\n\nIn separate judgments Higgins and Gavan Duffy JJ dissented on the basis that s 72 of the Constitution did not require the appointment of a judge for life and that a person who ceased to be a judge on the expiration of that person's term of office was not removed by the Governor-General.\n\nIf the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration could not enforce the award, then who could? Isaacs, Higgins, Powers and Rich JJ held that the award could be enforced in any Magistrates' court exercising summary jurisdiction.\n\nThe majority decision that the provisions conferring judicial power to enforce awards were invalid, raised the issue as to whether the invalidity extended to the provisions that allowed the award to be made. That is whether the invalid conferral of judicial power could be severed from the valid conferral of powers of arbitration. Isaacs, Higgins, Powers and Rich JJ held that these portions of the could be severed and that the rest of the Act was valid.\n\nBarton J dissented on the basis that the intention of parliament was that the two spheres of power \"should coexist in the same tribunal as parts of one whole\", such that the Act was wholly beyond the powers of the Parliament and that award was invalid and not enforceable.\n\nGriffith CJ held that the entire Act was valid and so upheld the validity of the award. His Honour however agreed with Barton J that the Act was not severable and that if the enforcement powers were invalid, as found by the majority, then the entire Act was invalid.\n\nThe effect of the decision was to uphold the validity of the award and that it was enforceable, just not in the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. There was thus no immediate practical need to amend the legislation. Higgins J continued to sit as the President, exercising the arbitral powers until his resignation in 1921. He was replaced as President by Powers J.\n\nIt was not until 1926 that the Parliament passed the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1926 which replaced the President with a Chief Judge who was appointed in the precise terms of s 72 of the Constitution.\n\nWhile the case is still quoted in relation to the extent of the judicial power, the main significance of the decision in relation to the powers of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration was subsumed by the decision in the Boilermakers case in 1956, that no Court could exercise both judicial and arbitral powers.\n\nThe case was referred to by the Attorney General in the second reading speech for the proposed referendum to provide for a retirement age for federal judges.As long ago as 1918, the High Court held in Alexander's case that section 72 requires that every justice of the High Court and every justice of any other court created by the Commonwealth Parliament, and indeed every magistrate so appointed, shall, subject to the power of removal contained in that section, be appointed for life. It has, in consequence, been generally accepted that justices of the High Court, and other Federal judges including magistrates, cannot be required to retire on reaching a specified age. This is an unsatisfactory situation. There is an almost universal practice that the holders of public offices retire on attaining a maximum retirement age. The reasons for this practice are well known and they do not need to be spelt out here.\n\nThe subsequent referendum was approved by a majority of electors nationwide, and in a majority of states. The constitution now requires appointment for a term expiring on the judge's age, with the consequence that the interpretation favoured by Higgins and Gavan Duffy JJ, permitting appointment for a fixed term, is not available unless there is a further constitutional amendment.\n"}

The intention was to encourage people into the newly rejuvenated city centre, with secular and religious events marking religious and other occasions during the relevant period. The name \"Winterval\" has since become used in the UK as shorthand for what are presented as attempts to \"rebrand\" Christmas so as not to exclude non-Christians.\n\nThe name \"Winterval\" was a portmanteau of \"winter\" and \"festival\", coined by the Council's Head of Events, Mike Chubb. In October 2008 he explained:\n\nThe programme of events in 1997 included theatre and arts events; marking of Diwali; candlelit tours of Aston Hall; an outdoor ice rink; a German-style Christmas market; Christmas lights in the streets; and a New Year's Eve Party. The front cover of the promotional brochure used the word \"Christmas\" three times and featured a photograph of the City's official Christmas tree. Each of its six pages featured the word \"Christmas\" in text or images.\n\nThe extended Winterval the following year included: Hallowe'en; Guy Fawkes Night; Diwali; Ramadan and Eid; Hanukkah; Advent, Christmas, and Boxing Day; New Year's Eve; and Chinese New Year.\n\nPosters were displayed, advertising Christmas events, with the word \"Christmas\" in large type, and the \"Winterval 98\" logo only as a footnote.\n\nChurch of England leaders in Birmingham criticised the 1998 \"Winterval\" concept. Mark Santer, then Bishop of Birmingham, said in a message to his parishes that he \"laughed out loud\" when he learned of the concept of Winterval, which he considered to be \"a way of not talking about Christmas\" and \"a well-meaning attempt not to offend\". He wondered whether Christianity had been censored. The Archdeacon of Aston called it \"a totally unnecessary example of political correctness to avoid sensitivities people simply do not have\". The council responded that \"Christmas is the very heart of Winterval\", saying that Christmas-themed events were prominent among those included in Winterval, and that Christmas-related words and symbols were prominent in its publicity material. While the Winterval season was longer than the Christmas season, Christmas was the focus of the relevant portion of Winterval, and a statement from Birmingham Council explained:\n\nNeighbouring Solihull council invited Birmingham residents desiring a traditional Christmas to go there instead.\n\nBirmingham City Council did not use the name \"Winterval\" after the 1998–9 season, but it persists as shorthand for any secular replacement for Christmas, used both by supporters and opponents of the traditional Christmas; it is also cited as a cautionary tale or urban legend by those who regard allegations of the existence of a \"war on Christmas\" as overblown. \n\nOn 8 November 2011 the \"Daily Mail\" issued a correction after using the term 'Winterval' in an opinion piece by Melanie Phillips, which it ran on 26 September 2011, stating:\n\nThe \"Winterval\" trope was also debunked by Stephen Fry, in a 2007 episode of the quiz-show \"QI\".\n\nThe lawyer and law correspondent David Allen Green, and the campaigner Inayat Bunglawala both included Winterval as an example in evidence to the Leveson Inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the British press. Green wrote:\n\n\n"}
