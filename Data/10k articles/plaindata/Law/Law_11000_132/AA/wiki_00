{"id": "3954001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3954001", "title": "Architectural glass", "text": "Architectural glass\n\nArchitectural glass is glass that is used as a building material. It is most typically used as transparent glazing material in the building envelope, including windows in the external walls. Glass is also used for internal partitions and as an architectural feature. When used in buildings, glass is often of a safety type, which include reinforced, toughened and laminated glasses.\nGlass casting is the process in which glass objects are cast by directing molten glass into a mould where it solidifies. The technique has been used since the Egyptian period. Modern cast glass is formed by a variety of processes such as kiln casting, or casting into sand, graphite or metal moulds. Cast glass windows, albeit with poor optical qualities, began to appear in the most important buildings in Rome and the most luxurious villas of Herculaneum and Pompeii.\n\nOne of the earliest methods of glass window manufacture was the \"crown glass\" method. Hot blown glass was cut open opposite the pipe, then rapidly spun on a table before it could cool. Centrifugal force shaped the hot globe of glass into a round, flat sheet. The sheet would then be broken off the pipe and trimmed to form a rectangular window to fit into a frame.\n\nAt the center of a piece of crown glass, a thick remnant of the original blown bottle neck would remain, hence the name \"bullseye\". Optical distortions produced by the bullseye could be reduced by grinding the glass. The development of diaper latticed windows was in part because three regular diamond-shaped panes could be conveniently cut from a piece of Crown glass, with minimum waste and with minimum distortion.\n\nThis method for manufacturing flat glass panels was very expensive and could not be used to make large panes. It was replaced in the 19th century by the cylinder, sheet, and rolled plate processes, but it is still used in traditional construction and restoration.\n\nIn this manufacturing process, glass is blown into a cylindrical iron mould. The ends are cut off and a cut is made down the side of the cylinder. The cut cylinder is then placed in an oven where the cylinder unrolls into a flat glass sheets.\n\nDrawn Sheet glass was made by dipping a leader into a vat of molten glass then pulling that leader straight up while a film of glass hardened just out of the vat – this is known as the Fourcault process. This film or ribbon was pulled up continuously held by tractors on both edges while it cooled. After 12 metres or so it was cut off the vertical ribbon and tipped down to be further cut. This glass is clear but has thickness variations due to small temperature changes just out of the vat as it was hardening. These variations cause lines of slight distortions. This glass may still be seen in older houses. Float glass replaced this process.\n\nDeveloped by James Hartledsay in 1848. The glass is taken from the furnace in large iron ladles, which are carried upon slings running on overhead rails; from the ladle the glass is thrown upon the cast-iron bed of a rolling-table; and is rolled into sheet by an iron roller, the process being similar to that employed in making plate-glass, but on a smaller scale. The sheet thus rolled is roughly trimmed while hot and soft, so as to remove those portions of glass which have been spoiled by immediate contact with the ladle, and the sheet, still soft, is pushed into the open mouth of an annealing tunnel or temperature-controlled oven called a lehr, down which it is carried by a system of rollers.\n\nThe polished plate glass process starts with sheet or rolled plate glass. This glass is dimensionally inaccurate and often created visual distortions. These rough panes were ground flat and then polished clear. This was a fairly expensive process.\n\nBefore the float process, mirrors were plate glass as sheet glass had visual distortions that were akin to those seen in amusement park or funfair mirrors.\n\nThe elaborate patterns found on figured (or 'Cathedral') rolled-plate glass are produced in a similar fashion to the rolled plate glass process except that the plate is cast between two rollers, one of which carries a pattern. On occasion, both rollers can carry a pattern. The pattern is impressed upon the sheet by a printing roller which is brought down upon the glass as it leaves the main rolls while still soft. This glass shows a pattern in high relief. The glass is then annealed in a lehr.\n\nThe glass used for this purpose is typically whiter in colour than the clear glasses used for other applications.\n\nThis glass can be laminated or toughened depending on the depth of the pattern to produce a safety glass.\n\nNinety percent of the world's flat glass is produced by the float glass process invented in the 1950s by Sir Alastair Pilkington of Pilkington Glass, in which molten glass is poured onto one end of a molten tin bath. The glass floats on the tin, and levels out as it spreads along the bath, giving a smooth face to both sides. The glass cools and slowly solidifies as it travels over the molten tin and leaves the tin bath in a continuous ribbon. The glass is then annealed by cooling in an oven called a lehr. The finished product has near-perfect parallel surfaces.\n\nThe side of the glass that has been in contact with the tin has a very small amount of the tin embedded in its surface. This quality makes that side of the glass easier to be coated in order to turn it into a mirror, however that side is also softer and easier to scratch.\n\nGlass is produced in standard metric thicknesses of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 19 and 22 mm, with 10mm being the most popular sizing in the architectural industry. Molten glass floating on tin in a nitrogen/hydrogen atmosphere will spread out to a thickness of about 6 mm and stop due to surface tension. Thinner glass is made by stretching the glass while it floats on the tin and cools. Similarly, thicker glass is pushed back and not permitted to expand as it cools on the tin.\n\nPrism glass is architectural glass which bends light. It was frequently used around the turn of the 20th century to provide natural light to underground spaces and areas far from windows. Prism glass can be found on sidewalks, where it is known as vault lighting, in windows, partitions, and canopies, where it is known as prism tiles, and as deck prisms, which were used to light spaces below deck on sailing ships. It could be highly ornamented; Frank Lloyd Wright created over forty different designs for prism tiles. Modern architectural prism lighting is generally done with a plastic film applied to ordinary window glass.\n\nGlass block, also known as glass brick, is an architectural element made from glass used in areas where privacy or visual obscuration is desired while admitting light, such as underground parking garages, washrooms, and municipal swimming baths. Glass block was originally developed in the early 1900s to provide natural light in industrial factories.\n\nAnnealed glass is glass without internal stresses caused by heat treatment, i.e., rapid cooling, or by toughening or heat strengthening. Glass becomes annealed if it is heated above a transition point then allowed to cool slowly, without being quenched. Float glass is annealed during the process of manufacture. However, most toughened glass is made from float glass that has been specially heat-treated.\n\nAnnealed glass breaks into large, jagged shards that can cause serious injury and is considered a hazard in architectural applications. Building codes in many parts of the world restrict the use of annealed glass in areas where there is a high risk of breakage and injury, for example in bathrooms, door panels, fire exits and at low heights in schools or domestic houses. Safety glass, such as laminated or tempered must be used in these settings to reduce risk of injury. \n\nLaminated glass is manufactured by bonding two or more layers of glass together with an interlayer, such as PVB, under heat and pressure, to create a single sheet of glass. When broken, the interlayer keeps the layers of glass bonded and prevents it from breaking apart. The interlayer can also give the glass a higher sound insulation rating.\n\nThere are several types of laminated glasses manufactured using different types of glass and interlayers which produce different results when broken.\n\nLaminated glass that is made up of annealed glass is normally used when safety is a concern, but tempering is not an option. Windshields are typically laminated glasses. When broken, the PVB layer prevents the glass from breaking apart, creating a \"spider web\" cracking pattern.\n\nTempered laminated glass is designed to shatter into small pieces, preventing possible injury. When both pieces of glass are broken it produces a \"wet blanket\" effect and it will fall out of its opening.\n\nHeat strengthened laminated glass is stronger than annealed, but not as strong as tempered. It is often used where security is a concern. It has a larger break pattern than tempered, but because it holds its shape (unlike the \"wet blanket\" effect of tempered laminated glass) it remains in the opening and can withstand more force for a longer period of time, making it much more difficult to get through.\n\nLaminated glass has similar properties to ballistic glass, but the two should not be confused. Both are made using a PVB interlayer, but they have drastically different tensile strength. Ballistic glass and laminated glass are both rated to different standards and have a different shatter pattern.\n\nHeat-strengthened glass, or tempered glass, is glass that has been heat treated to induce surface compression, but not to the extent of causing it to \"dice\" on breaking in the manner of tempered glass. On breaking, heat-strengthened glass breaks into sharp pieces that are typically somewhat smaller than those found on breaking annealed glass, and is intermediate in strength between annealed and toughened glasses.\n\nHeat-strengthened glass can take a strong direct hit without shattering, but has a weak edge. By simply tapping the edge of heat-strengthened glass with a solid object, it is possible to shatter the entire sheet. \n\nChemically strengthened glass is a type of glass that has increased strength. When broken it still shatters in long pointed splinters similar to float (annealed) glass. For this reason, it is not considered a safety glass and must be laminated if a safety glass is required. Chemically strengthened glass is typically six to eight times the strength of annealed glass.\n\nThe glass is chemically strengthened by submerging the glass in a bath containing a potassium salt (typically potassium nitrate) at . This causes sodium ions in the glass surface to be replaced by potassium ions from the bath solution.\n\nUnlike toughened glass, chemically strengthened glass may be cut after strengthening, but loses its added strength within the region of approximately 20 mm of the cut. Similarly, when the surface of chemically strengthened glass is deeply scratched, this area loses its additional strength.\n\nChemically strengthened glass was used on some fighter aircraft canopies.\n\nGlass coated with a low-emissivity substance can reflect radiant infrared energy, encouraging radiant heat to remain on the same side of the glass from which it originated, while letting visible light pass. This often results in more efficient windows because radiant heat originating from indoors in winter is reflected back inside, while infrared heat radiation from the sun during summer is reflected away, keeping it cooler inside.\n\nElectrically heatable glass is a relatively new product, which helps to find solutions while designing buildings and vehicles.\nThe idea of heating glass is based on usage of energy-efficient low-emissive glass that is generally simple silicate glass with special metallic oxides coating. Heatable glass can be used in all kinds of standard glazing systems, made of wood, plastic, aluminum or steel.\n\nA recent (2001 Pilkington Glass) innovation is so-called self-cleaning glass, aimed at building, automotive and other technical applications. A nanometre-scale coating of titanium dioxide on the outer surface of glass introduces two mechanisms which lead to the self-cleaning property. The first is a photo-catalytic effect, in which ultra-violet rays catalyse the breakdown of organic compounds on the window surface; the second is a hydrophilic effect in which water is attracted to the surface of the glass, forming a thin sheet which washes away the broken-down organic compounds.\n\nInsulating glass, or double glazing, consists of a window or glazing element of two or more layers of glazing separated by a spacer along the edge and sealed to create a dead air space between the layers. This type of glazing has functions of thermal insulation and noise reduction. When the space is filled with an inert gas it is part of energy conservation sustainable architecture design for low energy buildings.\n\nA 1994 innovation for insulated glazing is evacuated glass, which as yet is produced commercially only in Japan and China. The extreme thinness of evacuated glazing offers many new architectural possibilities, particularly in building conservation and historicist architecture, where evacuated glazing can replace traditional single glazing, which is much less energy-efficient.\n\nAn evacuated glazing unit is made by sealing the edges of two glass sheets, typically by using a solder glass, and evacuating the space inside with a vacuum pump. The evacuated space between the two sheets can be very shallow and yet be a good insulator, yielding insulative window glass with nominal thicknesses as low as 6 mm overall. The reasons for this low thickness are deceptively complex, but the potential insulation is good essentially because there can be no convection or gaseous conduction in a vacuum.\n\nUnfortunately, evacuated glazing does have some disadvantages; its manufacture is complicated and difficult. For example, a necessary stage in the manufacture of evacuated glazing is outgassing; that is, heating it to liberate any gases adsorbed on the inner surfaces, which could otherwise later escape and destroy the vacuum. This heating process currently means that evacuated glazing cannot be toughened or heat-strengthened. If an evacuated safety glass is required, the glass must be laminated. The high temperatures necessary for outgassing also tend to destroy the highly effective \"soft\" low-emissivity coatings that are often applied to one or both of the internal surfaces (i.e. the ones facing the air gap) of other forms of modern insulative glazing, in order to prevent loss of heat through infrared radiation. Slightly less effective \"hard\" coatings are still suitable for evacuated glazing, however.\n\nFurthermore, because of the atmospheric pressure present on the outside of an evacuated glazing unit, its two glass sheets must somehow be held apart in order to prevent them flexing together and touching each other, which would defeat the object of evacuating the unit. The task of holding the panes apart is performed by a grid of spacers, which typically consist of small stainless steel discs that are placed around 20 mm apart. The spacers are small enough that they are visible only at very close distances, typically up to 1 m. However, the fact that the spacers will conduct some heat often leads in cold weather to the formation of temporary, grid-shaped patterns on the surface of an evacuated window, consisting either of small circles of interior condensation centred around the spacers, where the glass is slightly colder than average, or, when there is dew outside, small circles on the exterior face of the glass, in which the dew is absent because the spacers make the glass near them slightly warmer.\n\nThe conduction of heat between the panes, caused by the spacers, tends to limit evacuated glazing’s overall insulative effectiveness. Nevertheless, evacuated glazing is still as insulative as much thicker conventional double glazing and tends to be stronger, since the two constituent glass sheets are pressed together by the atmosphere, and hence react practically as one thick sheet to bending forces. Evacuated glazing also offers very good sound insulation in comparison with other popular types of window glazing.\n\nThe most current building code enforced in most jurisdictions in the United States is the 2006 International Building Code (IBC, 2006). The 2006 IBC references for the 2005 edition of the standard Minimum Design Loads for buildings and other Structures prepared by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE, 2005) for its seismic provisions. ASCE 7-05 contains specific requirements for nonstructural components including requirements for architectural glass.\n\nIf incorrectly designed, concave surfaces with extensive amounts of glass can act as solar concentrators depending on the angle of the sun, potentially injuring people and damaging property.\n\n\n"}

The act established a fund to support the construction of provincial highways as part of the post-World War I reconstruction program of Robert Borden's Union government.\n\nIn the mid-nineteenth century, the primary modes of transportation were rail and waterways, and authority over them was granted to the federal government under Canada's Constitution; roads were thought of as a local concern and were delegated to the provinces. As the automobile rose in prominence in the early 20th century, organizations such as the Good Roads Movement and local motor clubs put pressure on governments to provide improved roads. Several provinces established their own highway authorities to coordinate the development of regional road networks. The federal government's first effort to fund highway construction came with the Railway Grade Crossing Fund in 1907.\n\nRobert Borden's Conservative government first proposed a federal assistance program for provincial road construction in 1913, but the program was rejected by the Liberal-dominated Senate over opposition to acting in an area of provincial jurisdiction. Interest in road funding was put aside during World War I, however automobile interest groups (including the 1915 establishment of the Canadian Automobile Association) maintained pressure on the federal government. Following the war, Borden's Union government established a reconstruction program including the Canada Highways Act, which passed in 1919.\n\nThe act established a fund to provide financial assistance to provincial highway projects, with an emphasis on encouraging interprovincial highway connections. The fund, administered by the Department of Railways and Canals, provided a maximum of $20 million to approved projects between 1 April 1919 and 31 March 1924. To qualify for funding, a province was required to develop a five-year provincial highways plan, including primary and secondary designations. Upon approval, the Dominion fund would subsidize 40% of the cost of construction.\n\nWork on provincial highways proceeded more slowly than anticipated. The fund was not depleted as of the expiry date in 1924, and so the deadline was extended to 31 March 1928. A report prepared by the Department showed that the fund contributed $19,596,388 toward $48,990,092 of provincial road construction, funding of roads in all nine provinces.\n"}

It is the central legislative piece in Quebec's language policy.\n\nProposed by Camille Laurin, the Minister of Cultural Development under the first Parti Québécois government of Premier René Lévesque, it was passed by the National Assembly, and granted Royal Assent by Lieutenant Governor Hugues Lapointe on August 26, 1977. The Charter's provisions expanded upon the 1974 \"Official Language Act\" (Bill 22), which was enacted by the Lieutenant Governor-in-Parliament during the tenure of Premier Robert Bourassa's Liberal government to make French the official language of Quebec. Prior to 1974, Quebec had no official language and was subject only to the requirements on the use of English and French contained in Article 133 of the British North America Act, 1867.\n\nBill 101 has been amended more than six times since 1977. Each amendment has aroused controversy over such provisions as the use of French on commercial signs or restrictions on enrolment into anglophone schools.\n\nThe preamble of the Charter states that the National Assembly resolved \"to make French the language of Government and the Law, as well as the normal and everyday language of work, instruction, communication, commerce and business\". It also states that the National Assembly is to pursue this objective \"in a spirit of fairness and open-mindedness\", recognizes \"the right of the Amerinds and the Inuit of Quebec, the first inhabitants of this land, to preserve and develop their original language and culture\".\n\nThe Charter of the French language consists of six titles and two schedules.\n\nThe nine chapters of Title I, pertaining to the status of the French language, declare French the sole official (chapter I), define the fundamental language rights of persons (chapter II), and defines the status of French in the parliament and the courts (chapter III), the civil administration (chapter IV), the semipublic agencies (chapter V), labour relations (VI), commerce and business (VII), and language of instruction (VIII).\n\nThe five chapters of Title II, pertain to linguistic officialization, toponymy, and the francization of the civil service and enterprises.\n\nTitle III establishes the Office québécois de la langue française (Quebec Office of the French language), defines its mission, powers, and organization.\n\nTitle IV establishes the Conseil supérieur de la langue française (Superior Council of the French language).\n\nTitle V and VI define penal provisions and sanctions and transitional and miscellaneous provisions.\n\nTo achieve the goal of making French the \"normal and everyday language of work, instruction, communication, commerce and business\" and ensure the respect of French Quebecers' language rights, the Charter contains a number of key provisions and various regulations.\n\nIn the first article of the Charter, French is declared the official language of Quebec.\n\nThe French language was previously declared the sole official language of Quebec with the adoption of the \"Official Language Act\" in 1974. Quebec is constitutionally obliged nonetheless to provide English services in the courts and the National Assembly of Quebec (see below).\n\nThe fundamental French language rights in Quebec are:\n\n\nFrench is the declared language of the legislature and courts in Quebec. Section 133 of the \"Constitution Act, 1867\", still in effect, nonetheless requires that bills be printed, published, passed, and assented to in French and in English in Parliaments and the legislatures of Canada and of Quebec.\n\nFrench or English may be used by any person before the courts of Quebec. Parties may request the translation in French or English of the judgments by the courts or decisions rendered by any \"body discharging quasi-judicial functions\".\n\nThe French text prevails over the English one, in case of any discrepancy, for any regulation to which section 133 of the Constitution Act of 1867 does not apply.\n\nThe first version of the Charter of the French Language provided that laws be enacted only in French. In 1979, the related provisions (articles 7 through 13) were rendered inoperative by a ruling of the Supreme Court of Canada in \"Attorney General of Quebec v. Blaikie\"; however, Quebec responded by re-enacting in French and in English the Charter of the French Language, leaving intact articles 7 through 13.\n\nIn 1993, the Charter's provisions related to the language of the legislature and courts were made compliant with the Supreme Court's ruling.\n\nThe government departments, agencies are designated by their French name alone, all administrative documents are drafted and published in the official language. All communications by the administration with other governments and legal persons, between departments and internally inside departments, are conducted in the official language.\n\nKnowledge of the official language appropriate to the office being applied for is required.\n\nA non-official language may be used on signs and posters of the administration for health or public safety reasons.\n\nPublic utilities and professional orders must provide service in the official language and use it for their internal and general communications. Professional orders may issue permits only to persons who have a knowledge of the official language appropriate to the practice of their profession.\n\nTen articles of the charter provide for the general goal of making French the language of labour relations.\n\nEmployers are to draw up written communications to their staff and publish job offers or promotions in the official language.\n\nAn employer cannot dismiss, lay off, demote or transfer a staff member on the sole account of his being exclusively French-speaking or of possessing insufficient knowledge of a non-official language, or because that member demanded the respect of his right to work in French. As a job requirement, knowledge or a specific level of knowledge of a language other than French is prohibited, unless the nature of the duties require it.\n\nThe \"Commission des relations du travail\" (Commission of Labour Relations) arbitrates in case of disagreement over the necessity of knowing a non-official language to perform a given work. The burden of the proof is on the employer.\n\nProduct labels, their instructions, manuals, warranty certificates as well as restaurant menus and wine lists must be in French. Other languages may be used, provided French's prominence is at least equivalent.\n\nCatalogues, brochures, folders, commercial directories and other such publications, must be in French. All software (for example, video games and operating systems) must be available in French unless no French version exists.\n\nSigns and posters must be in French, and they may also be in another language provided French is markedly predominant.\n\nA number of exceptions to the general rules for commercial products, signs, and advertising:\n\n\nIn some parts of Quebec like Montreal, signs with bilingual French and English text of equal sizes can be seen (such as in historically English educational institutions, and in federally regulated businesses), although French is sometimes predominant on these signs. For example, French is located to the left of other languages so that it is read \"before\" the non-French text when reading left to right. (Formerly, the size and colour of text in other languages were tightly regulated as well.)\n\nThough Article 97 clarifies that while \"the Indian reserves are not subject to this Act\", the local indigenous language is still subject to it off-reserve. For example, the local indigenous language is not exempted from the application of Article 58, whereby \"public signs, advertising and posters must be in French\", and may be in the local indigenous language \"provided that French is markedly predominant\".\n\nThough Article 58 does allow the provincial government to \"determine by regulation the places, cases, conditions or circumstances ... where French need not be predominant or where such signs, posters and advertising may be in another language only\", it imposes no obligation on the government to exempt the local indigenous language.\n\nThe language of instruction from kindergarten to secondary school is French. (The instruction language is the language in which the classes are taught. Learning of English as a second language is mandatory for all children attending French school beginning in elementary school.)\n\nArticles 87, 88 and 89 provide for the use of Amerindic languages and Inuktitut as language of instruction. The rate of introduction of French and English as languages of instruction is left to school committees and parents' committees.\n\nAt the request of parents, the following may receive instruction in English:\n\n\nThe original 1977 Charter provided for the English instruction not on the basis of a parent having received his instruction in English in \"Canada\", but in \"Quebec\" only. This came to be amended following the adoption of the \"Constitution Act 1982\", which defined the educational right of French and English minorities in all provinces under section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\nThe Office québécois de la langue française, informally known as the \"language police\", is the commission responsible for conducting the policy pertaining to linguistic officialization, toponymy and francization of civil administration and enterprises. It also has the mission of \"monitoring the linguistic situation in Québec\", promoting the official language, and conducting research. In 2016–17, the budget of the OQLF was . The office is frequently accused of abusing its powers, such as occurred in 2013 during the pastagate affair when an Italian restaurant was cited for having pasta, antipasti, calamari, and the like on its menu, instead of using French equivalents. The office also objects to the sale of \"grilled cheese sandwiches\", insisting that they be called , which literally translates to \"melted cheese sandwich\". Likewise, the Quebec language office objects to \"on/off\" switches and to the sale of \"steaks\", insisting that they be called , \"despite the fact that \"steak\" is the far more common term among Francophones.\"\n\nThe Conseil supérieur de la langue française (Superior Council of the French language) is an advisory council whose mission is \"to advise the minister responsible for the application of the Charter of the French language on any question relative to the French language in Quebec\". It works in close collaboration with equivalent bodies in France, Belgium and Switzerland.\n\nLanguage in Canada is defined federally by the Official Languages Act since 1969 and is part of the Constitution of Canada since 1982. Parts of the Charter of the French language have been amended in response to rulings by Quebec Courts which were upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\nBefore 1982, the only part of the Charter of the French Language that could be challenged constitutionally was that of the language of legislation and the courts. It was challenged in 1979 by Peter Blaikie, Roland Durand and Yoine Goldstein (\"Attorney General of Quebec v. Blaikie\").\n\nIn 1982, the patriation of the Canadian constitution occurred as the British Parliament passed the \"Canada Act 1982\". This act enacted the \"Constitution Act, 1982\" for Canada (including the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms); section 23 introduced the notion of \"minority-language education rights\". This opened another door to a constitutional dispute of Quebec's Charter of the French Language.\n\nAlliance Quebec, an anglophone rights lobby group, was founded in May 1982. It is mainly through this civil association that a number of lawyers have challenged the constitutionality of Quebec's territorial language policy.\n\nThe Charter of the French Language has been strongly condemned and widely unpopular among most of English-speaking Canadians, who constitute the majority of Canadians but are a minority in Quebec.\n\nThe Charter was criticised by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, who called Bourassa's Bill 22 as a \"slap in the face\", in his memoirs, as he saw it as contrary to the federal government's initiative to mandate bilingualism. Except for New Brunswick, most other provinces that accepted Trudeau's bilingualism initiative never fully implemented it. The most notable case was Ontario, where Premier Bill Davis did not grant full official status to the French language, despite the fact that the infrastructure was already in place.\n\nPolitical opposition to the Charter and earlier such language legislation has had limited success, given the support of the laws by the Parti Québécois and Quebec Liberal Party. Legislative initiatives prior to Bill 101 were often perceived by francophones as insufficient, such as \"An Act to promote the French language in Quebec\" (Bill 63). After Bourassa passed the \"Official Language Act\", opponents turned their support to the Union Nationale in the 1976 election, but despite that short resurgence of support, the party collapsed in the subsequent election. Court challenges have been more successful: Many of the key provisions of the initial language legislation having been rewritten to comply with rulings. Despite compliance since 1993 of the Charter with the Canadian constitution, opposition to the Charter and the government body enforcing it has continued.\n\nAccording to Statistics Canada, up to 244,000 English-speaking people have emigrated from Quebec to other provinces since the 1970s; those in Quebec whose sole native language was English dropped from 789,000 in 1971 to 575,555 in 2006, when they accounted for 7.6% of the population. Altogether, in 2006, 744,430 (10%) used mostly English as their home language, and 918,955 (12.2%) comprised the Official Language Minority, having English as their First Official language spoken. When many anglophones relocated outside of Quebec after the introduction of the Charter in the 1970s, several English-language schools in Montreal closed their doors. These school closures may also have been brought about by restrictions on who can attend English schools, which has been another ongoing drain on the English school system. Of the Anglophones between 25 and 44 years old who left the province between 1981 and 1986, 15000 individuals, which was half of this group, had university degrees. The province's unemployment rate rose from 8.7 percent in 1976 to 10.4 percent in 1977, remaining above 10 percent for 19 of the last 23 years of the 20th century. The language barrier has also been regarded as a \"soft cap\" for population growth; for instance from 2013 to 2014 while Montreal gained around 43,000 immigrants from other parts of the world it lost 10,000 residents to other provinces.\n\nMany companies, most notably Sun Life, Royal Bank and Bank of Montreal (which even considered removing \"Montreal\" from its name), moved their major operations to Toronto as a consequence of the adoption of this law. This concerted fleeing of business and subsequent loss of thousands of jobs is sometimes said to have hindered Quebec's economy and allowed Toronto to overtake Montreal as Canada's business centre. On the other hand, Toronto's advantage had been growing since the 1930s and had become apparent in the 1950s, and is also related to the greater importance of the United States, rather than Britain, in Canada's economy. It can also be said that this movement led to a larger role for Quebec Inc. in Quebec's economy.\n\nLevying fines of up to $7000 per offence, Charter enforcers were widely labelled in the English media as the \"language police\" or \"tongue troopers\". While the \"Office québécois de la langue française\" (OQLF) provides several warnings before resorting to legal sanctions, allegations that it has abused its powers has led to charges of racism and harassment. The OQLF took action against stores retailing imported kosher goods that did not meet its labelling requirements, an action perceived in the Jewish community as an unfair targeting that coincided with a high-profile case against the well-known Schwartz's delicatessen, the owner of which was subjected to failed legal action by the OQLF due to the apostrophe in his sign, which remains. In the mid-1980s, another delicatessen Dunn's got in trouble for having the English word, \"Smoked Meat\" on the sign out front. The manager at the time stated that Parti Québécois MNA Gérald Godin himself ordered the sandwich by its name. Dunn's also fought a ruling to change the name of \"Smoked Meat\" to \"Boeuf Mariné\" in order to conform to Quebec Language Law. They won the ruling by appeal by proving that if they didn't advertise \"Smoked Meat\" they would confuse and anger customers. Due to the work of Myer Dunn, under the new ruling, enacted in 1987, Smoked meat became a word in both Official languages of Canada. In 2002, there were reported cases of harassment of allophone merchants who refused to speak French.\n\nThe 2004 annual report of the OQLF was criticized by a columnist of \"The Gazette\" who alleged that there was a \"totalitarian mindset in the bureaucracy\". The columnist complained of sections of the report which described the continued prevalence of languages other than French in two-thirds of Montreal's households as an \"alarming\" trend that would present a formidable challenge to francophones in Montreal. In reality, the report judged alarming the fact that adoption of English as home language by allophones grew faster than the adoption of French as home language.\n\nThe use of the notwithstanding clause in the 1990s to circumvent the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms with regards to signage also resulted in reactions from other Canadian provinces; the \"syndrome de Sault Ste. Marie\" was a series of symbolic but divisive resolutions by some municipalities outside Quebec declaring their towns unilingually English in protest of what they saw as an infringement on the rights embodied in the charter. It is often believed that the controversy over the Charter was what influencing the Meech Lake Accord and Charlottetown Accord to fail.\nIt should be noted that the Supreme Court in their ruling regarding the signs case which led to the use of the notwithstanding clause, ruled that in fact any sign law was a violation of the freedom of expression right.\n\nAside from the civil rights infringement, the Charter has faced legal challenges because the restricted education opportunities have hindered not only unilingual but bilingual anglophones' employment. Although the Charter made French the official language of government and civil administration, the same cannot be said of the private sector. Despite nearly 30 years of the Charter, it has never been applied as rigorously as intended because to do so would violate civil liberties. English is still often made a requirement by employers in Montreal, including many French-Canadian owned ones, and, to a lesser extent, in Gatineau and Quebec City, with the workforce in Montreal remaining largely bilingual despite the Charter.\n\nOn November 14, 1988, the political and human rights watchdog organization Freedom House published \"The Doctrine of 'Preponderance of Blood' in South Africa, the Soviet Union and Quebec\" in its journal \"Exchange\". Introduced by Zbigniew Brzezinski (an anglophone who had once lived in Montreal) former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's National Security adviser, the essay compared the language of instruction provisions of the charter with South African apartheid statutes and jurisprudence. However, the Supreme Court of Canada disagreed with the discrimination-based-on-ancestry argument under the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms in \"Gosselin (Tutor of) v. Quebec (Attorney General)\", believing that it conflicted with section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The criteria used by Quebec to determine if parents are entitled to have their children instructed in English are the same as those found under section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\nThe 2001 report of the Estates-General on the Situation and Future of the French Language in Quebec identified the negative perception of Quebec's language policy in the rest of Canada and the United States as a problem to solve. It stated:\n\nIn Canada and abroad, the linguistic policy of Quebec is too often negatively perceived. The business community and the media in particular know it very little. For their part, the Americans remain opposed to a legislation that appears to them to reduce individual liberties and limit the use of English. For them, language and culture are two separate elements, they do not see how the protection of Quebec culture also includes the protection of the French language, even though 35 American States have adopted declarations proclaiming English the official language. Thus, must be developed the perception that Quebec culture is a part of the North-American heritage and that it is necessary to preserve it. It is also important to correct the erroneous perceptions regarding the Quebec language policy and its application. \n\nRecommendation 147 of the report suggested the creation of an institutional television and radio campaign targeting both Quebec citizens and certain groups abroad to inform on the facts of the situation of French in North America and the language policy of Quebec. Recommendation 148 suggested the creation of a watchdog to correct the errors made \"both in good faith and bad faith\" in the media.\n\nAs part of the effort to correct the errors of perception, the OQLF conducted an inquiry on the influence of Quebec's language policy abroad in countries where the fragility of certain languages prompted the use of legislative measures. It requested and published the opinions of various experts from Spain, Israel, the United States, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, Wales, Australia and Flanders in a special issue of the OQLF's \"Revue d'aménagement linguistique\" celebrating the 25th anniversary of Quebec's Charter of the French language in 2002.\n\nJonas Žilinskas, lecturer at University of Šiauliai, in Lithuania described the state of the Lithuanian language after a prolonged Russian rule over his country:\n\nOne proclaimed a policy of bilingualism which was expressed only by the obligation made to Lithuanians to learn Russian while Russians did not bother to learn Lithuanian. If the written Lithuanian language were more or less protected by writers through newspapers and publishers, the spoken Lithuanian language was degraded. Often, in the institutions, it was only a language of oral communication, the greatest part of technical documentation and correspondence being written in Russian.\n\nThis \"false bilingualism\" was followed by the Sąjūdis movement during which the people of Lithuania declared their language the sole official language and began working on a language policy modeled on the experience of Quebec.\n\nMart Rannut, vice-dean of research at the Department of philology of the University of Tallinn, in Estonia, recalled the influence of Quebec's expertise in the field of linguistic human rights and language planning which helped countries that have gained independence from the former Soviet Union and concluded that \"Bill 101 indirectly touched one sixth of the planet\".\n\nIna Druviete, at the time dean of the department of sociolinguistics at the Linguistic Institute of Latvia, noted the similarities between the language policies in all three Baltic States and that of Quebec. All policies aiming \"to prevent language shifts and to modify the hierarchy of languages in the public life. The principal sectors of intervention were the language used in the government agencies and the administration, in meetings and office spaces in particular, in corporate names, information and education. The principle of territorial linguistic rights was instituted.\"\n\nIn Wales, the language policy of Quebec had a great influence, but could not be implemented as it was in the Baltic States because Welsh speakers do not form a majority in this constituent country of the United Kingdom. According to Colin H. Williams, professor and researcher at the Welsh Department of Cardiff University particular lessons followed in Wales which stem from the experience of Quebec are:\n\n\nIn Israel, while the \"penetration of English in the sociolinguistic organization of the country\" is perceived, according to Bernard Spolsky, professor emeritus of English at the Bar-Ilan University, as a threat to Hebrew, the language policy has thus far only influenced linguists and some politicians. He writes:\n\nPeriodically, Israeli politicians present bills to proclaim Hebrew the sole official language of the country. Presently, Hebrew shares this title with Arabic only, because a measure was taken soon after the foundation of the State, in 1948, to modify the British policy, which imposed three languages, and gave up English. The last attempt at giving a judicial protection to Hebrew goes back to December 2000: two bills were then rejected.\nIn Catalonia, according to Miquel Reniu i Tresserras, president of the \"Comissió de Lectorats\" and former chief executive officer of the Catalan language policy, Quebec's legislation has constituted a \"reference model\" and the OQLF and the equivalent body in Catalonia are in close collaboration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Co., 235 N.Y. 468, 139 N.E. 576 (1922), was a products liability case before the New York Court of Appeals. The Court held that a plaintiff cannot recover from a defendant based on implied warranty when she does not have contractual privity with him; thus, a plaintiff cannot recover from a defendant who sold her employer food unfit for consumption, because the defendant's implied warranty extended only to the employer.\n\nChysky is part of a progression of cases that influenced the products liability synthesis that emerged early in the century. The Chysky case reflects a refinement of Judge Cardozo's argument in \"MacPherson v Buick Motor Co.\" that a person could be liable for a defective product to someone other than the immediate purchaser. In Chysky, Cardozo joined Judge McLaughlin's opinion, which relied on Cardozo's statement in MacPherson that the basis of liability in that case was in tort, not contract. \"If the exceptions expressed in MacPherson had been a smokescreen for the basic principle that a producer of a defective product would be liable to anyone who might be expected to use it, Cardozo would have applied the MacPherson principles to permit the waitress to recover regardless of her choice not to sue in tort. Yet Cardozo joined the majority that ruled against the waitress, not Judge Hogan's silent dissent.\"\n\nPlaintiff's employer gave her a piece of cake that had been made and sold to him by the defendant. There was a nail in a cake that struck her gum, causing it to be infected to the extent that three teeth needed to be removed.\n\nPlaintiff sued the person who sold the cake to her employer, upon the theory that he was liable to her since he had implicitly warranted (when he sold the cake to her employer) that it was fit for human consumption.\n\nDoes the provision of the Uniform Sales Act §15(1) that provides,\n\ninclude a third party who does not have privity of contract with the seller if no negligence is implied?\n\nNo, said the Court of Appeals. The provision does not include a third party who does not have privity of contract with the seller if no negligence is implied. If there is no privity of contract between third persons and the seller of food, there can be no implied warranty. The benefit of warranty (either express or implied) does not run with the chattel on its resale (and thus is unlike a covenant running with land, which does give a subsequent purchaser a right of action on a warranty).\n\nThe Court of appeals reasoned:\n\nThe plaintiff could have sued in tort rather than in contract (implied warranty), but plaintiff limited her right to recover to a breach of warranty. This indicates the continued relevance of privity in employment cases.\n\n"}
{"id": "44110144", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44110144", "title": "Civil forfeiture in the United States", "text": "Civil forfeiture in the United States\n\nCivil forfeiture in the United States, also called civil asset forfeiture or civil judicial forfeiture or occasionally civil seizure, is a legal process in which law enforcement officers take assets from persons suspected of involvement with crime or illegal activity without necessarily charging the owners with wrongdoing. While civil procedure, as opposed to criminal procedure, generally involves a dispute between two private citizens, civil forfeiture involves a dispute between law enforcement and \"property\" such as a pile of cash or a house or a boat, such that the thing is suspected of being involved in a crime. To get back the seized property, owners must prove it was not involved in criminal activity. Sometimes it can mean a threat to seize property as well as the act of seizure itself. \n\nProponents see civil forfeiture as a powerful tool to thwart criminal organizations involved in the illegal drug trade, with $12 billion annual profits, since it allows authorities to seize cash and other assets, from narcotics trafficking. They also argue that it is an efficient method since it allows law enforcement agencies to use these seized proceeds to further battle illegal activity, that is, directly converting value obtained from illegal items for law enforcement purposes by harming criminals economically while helping law enforcement financially. Critics argue that innocent owners can become entangled in the process to the extent that their right to property is violated, with few legal protections and due process rules to protect them in situations where they are presumed guilty instead of being presumed innocent. Further, critics argue that the incentives lead to corruption and law enforcement misbehavior. There is consensus that abuses have happened but disagreement about their extent as well as whether the overall benefits to society are worth the cost of the instances of abuse.\n\nCivil forfeiture has a history dating back several hundred years with roots in British maritime law to the British Navigation Acts around the middle 1600s. These laws required ships importing or exporting goods from British ports to fly the British flag; ships that failed to do this could be seized regardless of whether the ship's owner was guilty of doing any wrongdoing. It was easier to seize a vessel than try to apprehend an owner on the other side of the ocean, as explained by Supreme Court justice Joseph Story:\n\nDuring the later Colonial years, forfeiture practices by the Crown officials using writs of assistance were one of the many activities that angered colonists, who saw the writs as \"unreasonable searches and seizures\" that deprived persons of \"life, liberty, or property, without due process\". The early Congress wrote forfeiture laws based on British maritime law to help federal tax collectors collect customs duties, which financed most of the expenses of the federal government in the early days of the republic. Seizures allowed government to confiscate property from citizens who failed to pay taxes or customs duties. The Supreme Court upheld these forfeiture statutes in situations where it was virtually impossible to get hold of guilty persons on the high seas while possible to get hold of their property. During much of the 19th century there was not much attention paid to forfeiture laws.\n\nGovernment used forfeiture during the Prohibition years 1920–1933. Police seized vehicles and equipment and cash and other property from bootleggers. When Prohibition ended in 1933, much of the forfeiture activity ended as well, and modern forfeiture was an \"infrequent resort\" until the last few decades.\n\nCivil forfeiture activity increased substantially in the past thirty years. It stepped up forfeiture during the War on Drugs during the early 1980s and onwards. It became harder for criminal organizations to launder dirty money by means of the financial system, so drug cartels preferred bulk payments of cash. Illegal drugs are a big business; one estimate was that the annual profit from selling illegal drugs was $12 billion, according to the United States Drug Enforcement Administration. The initial intent, similar to methods used to try to fight alcohol trafficking and use during the Prohibition era, was to use civil forfeitures as a weapon against drug kingpins.\n\nAccording to journalist Sarah Stillman, a major turning point in forfeiture activity was the passage of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984. This law permitted local and federal law enforcement agencies to divvy up the seized assets and cash. Civil forfeiture allowed federal and local governments to \"extract swift penalties from white-collar criminals and offer restitution to victims of fraud\", according to Stillman. From 1985 to 1993, authorities confiscated $3 billion of cash and other property based on the federal \"Asset Forfeiture Program\", which included both civil and criminal forfeitures. The methods were supported by the Reagan administration as a crime fighting strategy.\n\nThe politics of civil forfeiture were somewhat unusual. The federal forfeiture laws were introduced and pushed through by Republicans in the 1980s, with support from some Democrats; but efforts to reform forfeiture laws have also come from the right, as libertarians in Congress have focused on the basic idea as offensive to property rights. In many areas civil forfeiture adversely affects persons from minorities and low-income communities, in which the typical seizure is less than $500, and Democrats have also been critical of civil forfeiture programs. The ACLU has also been a long time opponent.\n\nForfeiture was used for purposes other than trying to discourage illegal drug activity, such as attempts in New York City to discourage drunk driving. Forfeiture rules were used to confiscate cars of intoxicated motorists. In such instances, there are two types of cases: a criminal case against the drunk driver as a \"person\", and a civil case against the \"property\" used to facilitate the drunk driving, specifically their car. Critics contend that the punishment can be \"deemed out of proportion with the offense\"; for example, after a drunk driver is arrested and convicted and possibly imprisoned, is it proper to punish him or her additionally by civil forfeiture means by confiscating a $50,000 car? Civil forfeiture has been used to discourage illegal activities such as cockfighting, drag racing, gambling in basements, poaching of endangered fish, securities fraud, and other illegal activity.\nCourts helped set up the legal framework to help law enforcement stem the drug tide while sometimes trying to rein in abuses. A 1984 law set up the equitable sharing arrangement in which state and local police can share the seizures with federal agents. While the 1993 Supreme Court case \"Austin v. United States\" ruled that a forfeiture could be considered as an excessive fine, the court upheld the principle of civil forfeiture generally. A 1996 Supreme Court decision ruled that prosecuting a person for a crime and seizing his or her property via civil forfeiture did not constitute double jeopardy, and therefore did not violate the Constitution. However, in 1999, the Supreme Court ruled that civil forfeiture was not permitted if the amount seized was \"grossly disproportional\" to the gravity of the offense.\n\nLegislatures played a role as well. Since the 1990s, the number of federal statutes permitting government forfeiture doubled from 200 to 400. In 2000, lawmakers passed the \"Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act\", or \"CAFRA\", which stipulated protections for individuals and increased the level of proof required. Critics said that the new guidelines did not require poor persons to have free access to legal services. CAFRA guidelines suggest that if a claimant wins a civil-forfeiture case, that some of the legal fees paid to recover the property are partially payable by the government. CAFRA was supposed to raise government's burden of proof before seizing property. CAFRA meant if government loses a forfeiture challenge, government must pay the victim's attorney costs, but often victims are unaware of this fact, so they fail to hire lawyers thinking the cost will be prohibitive.\n\nPolice forces heeded instruction from a law enforcement consultant named Joe David who had an \"uncanny talent for finding cocaine and cash in cars and trucks\", according to one report. Officers trained in David's so-called \"Desert Snow\" stop-and-seizure techniques raked in $427 million from highway encounters during a five-year period. A contract allowed David's consulting firm to keep 25% of the seized cash.\n\nBut when innocent owners were sometimes ensnarled in seizure proceedings, it spurred criticism. In the early 1990s, San Francisco-based defense attorney Brenda Grantland organized a group called Forfeiture Endangers American Rights (which spells the letters \"FEAR\"), with branches in New Jersey, Virginia, California, and Massachusetts. Debate about reforming civil forfeiture procedures happened in the late 1990s but after public scrutiny died down, lawmakers quietly relaxed the reforms at the behest of police groups and prosecutors without much public debate.\n\nCivil forfeiture was used successfully on many occasions. For example, it was used to seize assets by corrupt foreigners, such as against Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, who stole money from the African nation of Equatorial Guinea and was convicted. Overall, the pattern in recent decades has been a substantial increase in forfeiture activity. According to government records, Justice department seizures went from $27 million in 1985 to $556 million in 1993 and $4.2 billion in 2012.\n\nIn 2015, Eric Holder ended the policy of \"adoptive forfeiture\", which occurred \"when a state or local law enforcement agency seizes property pursuant to state law and requests that a federal agency take the seized asset and forfeit it under federal law\" due to abuse. Although states proceeded to curtail the powers of police to seize assets, actions by the Justice Department in July 2017 have sought to reinstate police seizure powers that simultaneously raise funding for federal agencies and local law enforcement.\n\nCivil procedure cases generally involve disputes between two private citizens, often about money or property, while criminal procedure involves a dispute between a private citizen and the state, usually because a law has been broken. In legal systems based on British law such as that of the United States, civil and criminal law cases are handled differently, with different tests and standards and procedures, and this is true of forfeiture proceedings as well. Both civil and criminal forfeiture involve the taking of assets by police.\n\nIn civil forfeiture, assets are seized by police based on a suspicion of wrongdoing, and without having to charge a person with specific wrongdoing, with the case being between police and the \"thing itself\", sometimes referred to by the Latin term \"in rem\", meaning \"against the property\"; the property itself is the defendant and no criminal charge against the owner is needed.\n\nIn contrast, criminal forfeiture is a legal action brought as \"part of the criminal prosecution of a defendant\", described by the Latin term \"in personam\", meaning \"against the person\", and happens when government indicts or charges the property that is either used in connection with a crime, or derived from a crime, that is suspected of being committed by the defendant; the seized assets are temporarily held and become government property officially \"after\" an accused person has been convicted by a court of law; if the person is found to be not guilty, the seized property must be returned.\n\nThe tests to establish the burden of proof are different; in civil forfeiture, the test in most cases is whether police feel there is a preponderance of the evidence suggesting wrongdoing; in criminal forfeiture, the test is whether police feel the evidence is beyond a reasonable doubt, which is a tougher test to meet.\n\nIf property is seized in a civil forfeiture, it is \"up to the owner to prove that his cash is clean\". Normally both civil and criminal forfeiture require involvement by the judiciary; however, there is a variant of civil forfeiture called \"administrative forfeiture\", which is essentially a civil forfeiture that does not require involvement by the judiciary, which derives its powers from the Tariff Act of 1930, and empowers police to seize banned imported merchandise, as well as things used to import or transport or store a controlled substance, money, or other property that is less than $500,000 value.\n\nAccording to the Justice Department, there are three main justifications for civil forfeitures:\n\nSince police can charge a person with a crime in a criminal case and charge his or her things in a civil case, issues such as double jeopardy have been raised. Further, there has been debate about whether seizures of property are considered as a fine or as a punishment in a legal sense. The distinction was clarified by the Supreme Court in \"United States v. Bajakajian\", which decreed that a criminal forfeiture could be considered as both a type of fine and a punishment, while a civil forfeiture was not intended as a punishment of a person but rather a \"legal fiction of punishing the property\". As a result, the court decreed that civil forfeitures that served as remedial were not considered as a type of fine.\n\nGenerally the United States Supreme Court has upheld the principle of civil asset forfeiture at the federal level. The Court ruled in \"Austin v. United States\" (1993) that such civil forfeiture, treated as punitive actions, are subject to the Excessive Fines clause of the Eighth Amendment, though whether this is incorporated to state and local civil forfeitures is a question asked in the pending case, \"Timbs v. Indiana\" (2018). In addition, there are more than 400 federal statutes that empower police to take assets from convicted criminals, as well as from persons not charged with criminality. Sometimes the seizures happen as a result of different government agencies working together, such as the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Justice. Police at national and state levels cooperate in many instances according to procedural laws known as equitable sharing. In addition, there are laws that make it difficult for criminals to get dirty money clean by methods of money laundering; for example, law requires that cash deposits greater than $10,000 to a bank account be reported by the bank to the federal government, and there have been instances in which repeated cash deposits under this amount have looked suspicious to authorities even though they were done legitimately, leading to civil forfeiture seizures directly from a bank account. What has caused controversy is when the property of innocent persons is seized by police who believe that the seized items were involved in criminal activity.\n\nAlthough there are accessible statistics of seizures at the federal level, it often happens that the totals of forfeitures from both criminals and innocent owners are combined; for example, one report was that in 2010, government seized $2.5 billion in assets from criminals and innocent owners by forfeiture methods, and the totals of assets seized incorrectly from innocent owners was not separated statistically. Further, since the United States is a federal republic with governments at both the national and state level, there are civil forfeiture seizures at the state level, which are not tracked and recorded in any central database, which make it difficult to make assessments, since state laws and procedures vary widely. According to \"The Washington Post\", federal asset forfeiture in 2014 accounted for over $5 billion going into Justice and Treasury Department coffers, while in comparison, official statistics show that the amount stolen from citizens by burglars during that same year was a mere $3.5 billion.\n\nCivil forfeiture begins when government suspects that a property is connected with illegal drug activity, and files a civil action:\n\nProperties that can be confiscated include real estate property such as a house or motel, cars, cash, jewelry, boats, and almost anything suspected of being related to the manufacture and sale and transportation of illegal controlled substances, such as:\n\n\nOne method of intercepting funds is by highway interdictions, typically along highway routes suspected to be used regularly by drug smugglers, often between Mexico and the United States.\n\nNews media have reported many examples:\n\nIf a passing motorist does not sign a waiver and it becomes recorded as a legal case, the case names are often unusual. In a civil forfeiture case, the asset itself is listed as the \"defendant\". For example, one case was titled \"State of Texas v. One Gold Crucifix\", based on a traffic stop in which a woman was pulled over, no charges were filed, but this item of jewelry was seized. Another case name was \"United States v. $35,651.11 in U.S. Currency\".\n\n\"The Washington Post\" analyzed 400 seizures in 17 states that were examples of equitable sharing arrangements. Police stop motorists under the pretext of a minor traffic infraction, and \"analyze\" the intentions of motorists by assessing nervousness, and request permission to search the vehicle without a warrant; however, of the 400 seizures studied by \"The Washington Post\", police did not make any arrests.\n\nCash has been seized in peculiar circumstances. For example, New York businessman James Lieto's $392,000 in cash was seized by federal authorities, since his legitimate funds mixed up with illegal funds in an armored car that was seized by an FBI probe. Lieto had to wait until the government's criminal case was finished before he could get his money back, which took considerable time, and caused considerable financial hardship and stress.\n\nPolice have broken into homes. In March 2012, in the middle of the night, without a warrant, New York City police burst into the home of Gerald Bryan, ransacked his belongings, ripped out light fixtures, arrested him, and seized $4,800 of his cash, but after a year, the case against him was dropped. When Bryan tried to get back his money, he was told it was \"too late\" since the money had already been put into the police pension fund. Victims of forfeiture often find themselves faced with fighting in a \"labyrinthine\" procedure to get their money back.\n\nIn May, 2013, IRS agents seized $32,821 from the account of a restaurant owner in Arnolds Park, Iowa, on suspicion of tax evasion, but the seizure was contested by lawyers from the Institute for Justice.\n\nPolice can seize not only cash from cars but real estate such as a person's home. For example, homes have been seized even if someone other than the homeowner on the premises committed drug crimes without the owner's awareness. If the IRS suspects that property is involved with crime, or has been produced as a result of crime, then it has a pretext with which to seize it. From 2010 to 2013, two motel owners were under constant threat of their property being seized after there were incidents of drug selling on the motel premises. A judge ruled in 2013 that the owners could keep their motel since the owners did not know about the illegal activity and took all reasonable steps to prevent it.\n\nPolice seized a house on the pretext that it was being used for selling drugs, after a couple's son was arrested for selling $40 worth of illegal drugs. In another case, homeowners Carl and Mary Shelden sold their house to a man who was later convicted of fraud, but because of the real estate transaction, the Sheldens got caught up in a 10-year legal battle that left them \"virtually bankrupt\"; after years, they finally got back their house but it was in badly damaged condition; the Sheldens had done nothing wrong.\n\nIn Detroit, men suspected of hiring prostitutes had their automobiles seized. An owner's sailboat was taken after he was caught with a negligible amount of marijuana. Members of the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office were charged with fraud after knowingly selling counterfeit goods at an asset forfeiture auction.\n\nFive states (California, Connecticut, Indiana, New York, and Oregon) have statutes that allow law enforcement officials to seize a person's firearms without a warrant or court order if there is probable cause the individual is mentally unstable or may use the weapons to commit a crime. The weapons are to be held in the custody of the law enforcement agency until the case against the individual is dispositioned in a court of law; or the weapons must be returned to the owner if no criminal charges are filed within the timeframe specified by law. In practice, some law enforcement agencies in these states have been known to either sell or destroy seized firearms without compensating the owner after the legal matter that led to the initial seizure has been settled.\n\nThe government can seize money directly from a bank account. One way this happens is when there are large numbers of cash deposits that government investigators suspect are structured as a way to avoid deposits exceeding $10,000, since deposits greater than that amount must be reported to the federal government. But it can happen that legitimate businesses have regular large deposits of cash. In one instance, the Internal Revenue Service waited for large deposits to be placed into an owner's bank account, and then forced the bank by legal means to surrender it to the agency by means of a secret warrant; authorities took $135,000 from Michigan restaurant owners, named the Cheung family, who made cash deposits from their Chinese restaurant. In another instance, a businessman in New Jersey made repeated cash deposits to save for purchasing a house; each payment was below the $10,000 threshold for reporting to the government, but there were 21 deposits over a period of four months, which caused government to suspect that criminal activity was involved; as a result, the IRS seized $157,000 and the businessman was forced to hire an attorney to get his funds returned. Officials seized $35,000 from the bank account of a grocery store \"without any warning or explanation\" in 2013.\n\nAfter police and authorities have possession of cash or other seized property, there are two ways in which the seized assets become permanently theirs: first, if a prosecutor can prove that seized assets were connected to criminal activity in a courtroom, or second, if nobody tries to claim the seized assets. What happens in many instances is that the assets revert to police ownership by default. If a victim challenges the seizure, prosecutors sometimes offer to return half of the seized funds as part of a deal in exchange for not suing. Sometimes police, challenged by lawyers or by victims, volunteer to return all of the money provided that the victim promises not to sue police or prosecutors; according to \"The Washington Post\", many victims sign simply to get some or all of their money back. Victims often have \"long legal struggles to get their money back\". One estimate was that only one percent of federally taken property is ever returned to their former owners.\n\nStatistical evidence suggests a strong upward trend in recent years towards greater seizure activity. In 1986, the Department of Justice's \"Asset Forfeiture Fund\" took in $93.7 million; in 2008, it took in $1 billion. Much of this growth happened in the past decade; one analysis suggested that seizures had grown 600 percent from 2002 to 2012. From 2005 to 2010, government seizures of assets from both criminals as well as innocent citizens went from $1.25 billion to $2.50 billion. Federal authorities seized over $4 billion in 2013 through forfeiture, with some of the money being taken from innocent victims. In 2010, there were 15,000 cases of forfeitures. Over 12 years, agencies have taken $20 billion in cash, securities, other property from drug bosses and Wall Street tycoons as well as \"ordinary Americans who have not committed crimes\". One estimate was that in 85% of civil forfeiture instances, the property owner was never charged with a crime. In 2010, there were 11,000 noncriminal forfeiture cases. In 2010, claimants challenged 1,800 civil forfeiture seizures in federal court.\n\nCivil forfeiture varies greatly state by state. An analysis by Sarah Stillman in \"The New Yorker\" suggested that states that place seized funds in neutral accounts, such as Maine, Missouri (which puts seized funds in accounts for public education), North Dakota, and Vermont, have been much less likely to have major scandals involving forfeiture abuse. States like Texas and Virginia and Georgia, which have few restrictions on how police use the seized funds have had more scandals, as well as states that allow the Equitable sharing program. With Equitable Sharing, state police can \"skirt state restrictions on the use of funds\", according to Stillman. In Florida, using Equitable Sharing, the small village of Bal Harbour raked in at least $71.5 million in three years by its vice squad by carrying out an undercover money laundering sting operation, but in the end, made no arrests.\n\nCivil forfeiture has generated substantial controversy.\n\nProponents argue that civil forfeiture tactics are necessary to help police fight serious crime. It is seen as a vital and powerful weapon in the continuing battle against illegal drugs, and effective at discouraging criminal activity. It makes it easier for law enforcement to fight organized crime when they had trouble imprisoning offenders, since they could deprive them of their property and income when it is much harder to prove their guilt in a court of law.\n\nThe head of the asset forfeiture section of the Department of Justice said that civil forfeiture of cash from innocents was insignificant compared to the \"thousands of traffic stops\" that bust major drug money couriers.\n\nCivil forfeiture has been used to restore money stolen by fraud and other schemes by corrupt politicians. Civil forfeiture targets cybercrime, fraud, and scams in high finance at Wall Street, and money-laundering on a global scale. It enables police to have sufficient power to \"return money to crime victims\" in instances of swindling or fraud. Civil forfeiture laws were helpful in enabling authorities to seize and return swindled funds by the Bernard Madoff fraud.\n\nProponents argue that government has sufficient safeguards in place so that individuals can challenge seizures if the need arises. Justice William H. Rehnquist said in a Supreme Court decision that federal forfeiture in drug-related cases was not a punishment but served nonpunitive purposes such as encouraging people to be careful that their property was not used illegally. A lobbyist for the Maryland State Police named Thomas Williams argued that bills to require police to keep better records of seized property would cost law enforcement more time and money, and that trying to track seizures by multi-agency task forces would not be easy. Proponents say that when claimants contest the seizures, they rarely win back their money, suggesting that the \"system is working properly\". Proponents say the system is monitored to make sure seizures are properly done. In addition, the funds enable police forces to equip themselves further for more effective crime prevention; for example, a $3.8 million drug bust let officers equip their cars with $1,700 video cameras and heat-sensing equipment for a seven-member force.\n\nCritics include citizens, defense attorneys, and advocates for civil rights.\nThey point to serious instances of abuse in which innocent owners have been victimized. Critics are from both sides of the political spectrum, from left-leaning groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union and right-leaning groups such as The Heritage Foundation. The main criticisms of civil forfeiture proceedings are as follows:\n\n\n\nThere have been numerous reports in the media about systemic abuse of civil forfeiture. \"USA Today\" described it as \"an increasingly common—and utterly outrageous—practice that can amount to legalized theft by police\". Reporter Sarah Stillman writing in \"The New Yorker\" interviewed numerous police officers, lawyers, prosecutors, justices and plaintiffs around the United States and found that many had reservations that innocent Americans were being abused. \"The New Yorker\" published a \"sprawling investigation\" about how cities abuse civil forfeiture to \"bolster their cash-strapped coffers by seizing the assets of the poor, often on trumped up charges\". Comedian John Oliver devoted a presentation to a satirical exposure of civil forfeiture in 2014.\n\nOrganizations working for reform, as well as helping individual victims, include the Institute for Justice, a libertarian nonprofit law firm in Washington, D.C., which works to end civil forfeiture abuse. It has helped numerous clients recover property seized by the government. The Institute of Justice is helping one forfeiture victim sue the federal district court as well as the mayor, district attorney, and police commissioner in Philadelphia. Scott Bullock, senior attorney at the Institute for Justice, advocates that civil forfeiture should be abolished except for use in enforcing maritime and customs laws, and require that any seizures be linked to criminal convictions of specific people. If that is not possible, Bullock recommends that seized revenues be placed in neutral funds such as drug treatment efforts, that standards of proof for law enforcement be raised to ensure that police provide \"clear and convincing evidence\" of wrongdoing, that the burden of proof should be moved to government to prove wrongdoing, that seized assets should be tracked such that information is easily accessible by the public, and that the equitable sharing arrangement be abolished. Sometimes victims turn to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) for legal assistance in winning back their seized property.\n\nThere has been opposition to civil forfeiture in some lower courts. There have been attempts by lawmakers to introduce legislation to prevent abuses based on civil forfeiture procedures; one proposal was to raise the standard of proof necessary before property could be seized, and require government to prove that an owner of property was involved in an illegal criminal activity before such seizures could happen. There have been class action lawsuits against authorities, such as one in East Texas by black and Latino drivers; the suit alleges that police took $3 million from 2006 to 2008 in 140 separate incidents. One reform effort is to require authorities to keep better records about seized assets.\n\nIn 2015, the New Mexico legislature outlawed civil forfeiture. Also in 2015 a number of criminal justice reformers, including the Koch family foundations and the ACLU, announced plans to advocate the reduction of asset forfeitures due to the disproportionate penalty it places on low-income wrongdoers; the forfeiture of private property in such cases often results in the deprivation of the majority of an individual's wealth.\n\nAs civil forfeiture may not be allowed a new practice has emerged. By classifying valuables such as cars, cellphones, and wallets with cash as evidence the police can keep them and by making it very difficult and time consuming to get them back. After 120 days the police can sell the items.\n\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has been using civil forfeiture as one way of funding their efforts to combat the use of illegal drugs, including marijuana, which continues to be illegal to possess under Federal law as of 2016. According to government figures, the DEA collected $18 million in 2013 as part of its Cannabis Eradication Program. Proponents in favor of legalizing marijuana have objected to this practice, which includes DEA seizures of properties in which marijuana is used and sold. A bill has been proposed in the United States Congress to eliminate this source of funding. As more states progress towards legalizing marijuana for medical use and for recreational use, there are more businesses to sell marijuana, sometimes called dispensaries or \"weed shops\". A report in \"The Guardian\" in 2015 suggested that such shops operated in a \"tricky gray zone\", so that even in the 23 states where medicinal cannabis is legal, such dispensaries can be \"wiped out by a single visit from law enforcement\". While state law may recognize such establishments as having a legal purpose, federal law does not recognize this, and conflicting interpretations can emerge, which can result in properties being confiscated. It has sparked controversy and, in some instances, public outrage.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2589535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2589535", "title": "Civilian control of the military", "text": "Civilian control of the military\n\nCivilian control of the military is a doctrine in military and political science that places ultimate responsibility for a country's strategic decision-making in the hands of the civilian political leadership, rather than professional military officers. The reverse situation, where professional military officers control national politics, is called a military dictatorship. A lack of control over the military may result in a state within a state. One author, paraphrasing Samuel P. Huntington's writings in \"The Soldier and the State\", has summarized the civilian control ideal as \"the proper subordination of a competent, professional military to the ends of policy as determined by civilian authority\".\n\nCivilian control is often seen as a prerequisite feature of a stable liberal democracy. Use of the term in scholarly analyses tends to take place in the context of a democracy governed by elected officials, though the subordination of the military to political control is not unique to these societies. One example is the People's Republic of China. Mao Zedong stated that \"Our principle is that the Party commands the gun, and the gun must never be allowed to command the Party,\" reflecting the primacy of the Communist Party of China (and communist parties in general) as decision-makers in Marxist–Leninist and Maoist theories of democratic centralism.\n\nAs noted by University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor Richard H. Kohn, \"civilian control is not a fact but a process\". Affirmations of respect for the values of civilian control notwithstanding, the actual level of control sought or achieved by the civilian leadership may vary greatly in practice, from a statement of broad policy goals that military commanders are expected to translate into operational plans, to the direct selection of specific targets for attack on the part of governing politicians. National Leaders with limited experience in military matters often have little choice but to rely on the advice of professional military commanders trained in the art and science of warfare to inform the limits of policy; in such cases, the military establishment may enter the bureaucratic arena to advocate for or against a particular course of action, shaping the policy-making process and blurring any clear-cut lines of civilian control.\n\nAdvocates of civilian control generally take a Clausewitzian view of war, emphasizing its political character. The of Georges Clemenceau, \"War is too serious a matter to entrust to military men\" (also frequently rendered as \"War is too important to be left to the generals\"), wryly reflect this view. Given that broad strategic decisions, such as the decision to declare a war, start an invasion, or end a conflict, have a major impact on the citizens of the country, they are seen by civilian control advocates as best guided by the will of the people (as expressed by their political representatives), rather than left solely to an elite group of tactical experts. The military serves as a special government agency, which is supposed to \"implement\", rather than \"formulate\", policies that require the use of certain types of physical force. Kohn succinctly summarizes this view when he writes that:\nThe point of civilian control is to make security subordinate to the larger purposes of a nation, rather than the other way around. The purpose of the military is to defend society, not to define it.\n\nA state's effective use of force is an issue of great concern for all national leaders, who must rely on the military to supply this aspect of their authority. The danger of granting military leaders full or sovereignty is that they may ignore or supplant the democratic decision-making process, and use physical force, or the threat of physical force, to achieve their preferred outcomes; in the worst cases, this may lead to a coup or military dictatorship. A related danger is the use of the military to crush domestic political opposition through intimidation or sheer physical force, interfering with the ability to have free and fair elections, a key part of the democratic process. This poses the paradox that \"because we fear others we create an institution of violence to protect us, but then we fear the very institution we created for protection\". Also, military personnel, because of the nature of their job, are much more willing to use force to settle disputes than civilians because they are trained military personnel that specialize strictly in warfare. The military is authoritative and hierarchical, rarely allowing discussion and prohibiting dissention. For instance, in the Empire of Japan, prime ministers and almost everyone in high positions were military people like Hideki Tojo, and advocated and basically pressured the leaders to start military conflicts against China and others because they believed that they would ultimately be victorious.\n\nMany of the Founding Fathers of the United States were suspicious of standing militaries. As Samuel Adams wrote in 1768, \"Even when there is a necessity of the military power, within a land, a wise and prudent people will always have a watchful and jealous eye over it\". Even more forceful are the words of Elbridge Gerry, a delegate to the American Constitutional Convention, who wrote that \"[s]tanding armies in time of peace are inconsistent with the principles of republican Governments, dangerous to the liberties of a free people, and generally converted into destructive engines for establishing despotism.\"\n\nIn Federalist No. 8, one of \"The Federalist\" papers documenting the ideas of some of the Founding Fathers, Alexander Hamilton expressed concern that maintaining a large standing army would be a dangerous and expensive undertaking. In his principal argument for the ratification of the proposed constitution, he argued that only by maintaining a strong union could the new country avoid such a pitfall. Using the European experience as a negative example and the British experience as a positive one, he presented the idea of a strong nation protected by a navy with no need of a standing army. The implication was that control of a large military force is, at best, difficult and expensive, and at worst invites war and division. He foresaw the necessity of creating a civilian government that kept the military at a distance.\n\nJames Madison, another writer of many of \"The Federalist\" papers, expressed his concern about a standing military in comments before the Constitutional Convention in June 1787:\n\nIn time of actual war, great discretionary powers are constantly given to the Executive Magistrate. Constant apprehension of War, has the same tendency to render the head too large for the body. A standing military force, with an overgrown Executive, will not long be safe companions to liberty. The means of defense against foreign danger, have been always the instruments of tyranny at home. Among the Romans it was a standing maxim to excite a war, whenever a revolt was apprehended. Throughout all Europe, the armies kept up under the pretext of defending, have enslaved the people.\nThe United States Constitution placed considerable limitations on the legislature. Coming from a tradition of legislative superiority in government, many were concerned that the proposed Constitution would place so many limitations on the legislature that it would become impossible for such a body to prevent an executive from starting a war. Hamilton argued in Federalist No. 26 that it would be equally as bad for a legislature to be unfettered by any other agency and that restraints would actually be more likely to preserve liberty. James Madison, in Federalist No. 47, continued Hamilton’s argument that distributing powers among the various branches of government would prevent any one group from gaining so much power as to become unassailable. In Federalist No. 48, however, Madison warned that while the separation of powers is important, the departments must not be so far separated as to have no ability to control the others.\n\nFinally, in Federalist No. 51, Madison argued that to create a government that relied primarily on the good nature of the incumbent to ensure proper government was folly. Institutions must be in place to check incompetent or malevolent leaders. Most importantly, no single branch of government ought to have control over any single aspect of governing. Thus, all three branches of government must have some control over the military, and the system of checks and balances maintained among the other branches would serve to help control the military.\n\nHamilton and Madison thus had two major concerns: (1) the detrimental effect on liberty and democracy of a large standing army and (2) the ability of an unchecked legislature or executive to take the country to war precipitously. These concerns drove American military policy for the first century and a half of the country’s existence. While armed forces were built up during wartime, the pattern after every war up to and including World War II was to demobilize quickly and return to something approaching pre-war force levels. However, with the advent of the Cold War in the 1950s, the need to create and maintain a sizable peacetime military force \"engendered new concerns\" of militarism and about how such a large force would affect civil–military relations in the United States.\n\nThe United States' Posse Comitatus Act, passed in 1878, prohibits any part of the Army or the Air Force (since the U.S. Air Force evolved from the U.S. Army) from engaging in domestic law enforcement activities unless they do so pursuant to lawful authority. Similar prohibitions apply to the Navy and Marine Corps by service regulation, since the actual Posse Comitatus Act does not apply to them. The Coast Guard is exempt from Posse Comitatus since it normally operates under the Department of Homeland Security versus the Department of Defense and enforces U.S. laws, even when operating as a service with the U.S. Navy.\n\nThe act is often misunderstood to prohibit any use of federal military forces in law enforcement, but this is not the case. For example, the President has explicit authority under the Constitution and federal law to use federal forces or federalized militias to enforce the laws of the United States. The act's primary purpose is to prevent local law enforcement officials from utilizing federal forces in this way by forming a \"posse\" consisting of federal Soldiers or Airmen.\n\nThere are, however, practical political concerns in the United States that make the use of federal military forces less desirable for use in domestic law enforcement. Under the U.S. Constitution, law and order is primarily a matter of state concern. As a practical matter, when military forces are necessary to maintain domestic order and enforce the laws, state militia forces under state control i.e., that state's Army National Guard and/or Air National Guard are usually the force of first resort, followed by federalized state militia forces i.e., the Army National Guard and/or Air National Guard \"federalized\" as part of the U.S. Army and/or U.S. Air Force, with active federal forces (to include \"federal\" reserve component forces other than the National Guard) being the least politically palatable option.\n\nMaoist military-political theories of people's war and democratic centralism also support the subordination of military forces to the directives of the communist party (although the guerrilla experience of many early leading Communist Party of China figures may make their status as civilians somewhat ambiguous). In a 1929 essay \"On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party\", Mao explicitly refuted \"comrades [who] regard military affairs and politics as opposed to each other and [who] refuse to recognize that military affairs are only one means of accomplishing political tasks\", prescribing increased scrutiny of the People's Liberation Army by the Party and greater political training of officers and enlistees as a means of reducing military autonomy . In Mao's theory, the military—which serves both as a symbol of the revolution and an instrument of the dictatorship of the proletariat—is not merely expected to defer to the direction of the ruling non-uniformed Party members (who today exercise control in the People's Republic of China through the Central Military Commission), but also to actively participate in the revolutionary political campaigns of the Maoist era.\nCivilian leaders cannot usually hope to challenge their militaries by means of force, and thus must guard against any potential usurpation of powers through a combination of policies, laws, and the inculcation of the values of civilian control in their armed services. The presence of a distinct civilian police force, militia, or other paramilitary group may mitigate to an extent the disproportionate strength that a country's military possesses; civilian gun ownership has also been justified on the grounds that it prevents potential abuses of power by authorities (military or otherwise). Opponents of gun control have cited the need for a balance of power in order to enforce the civilian control of the military.\n\nThe establishment of a civilian head of state, head of government or other government figure as the military's commander-in-chief within the chain of command is one legal construct for the propagation of civilian control.\n\nIn the United States, Article I of the Constitution gives the Congress the power to declare war (in the War Powers Clause), while Article II of the Constitution establishes the President as the commander-in-chief. Ambiguity over when the President could take military action without declaring war resulted in the War Powers Resolution of 1973.\n\nAmerican presidents have used the power to dismiss high-ranking officers as a means to assert policy and strategic control. Three examples include Abraham Lincoln's dismissal of George McClellan in the American Civil War when McClellan failed to pursue the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia following the Battle of Antietam, Harry S. Truman relieving Douglas MacArthur of command in the Korean War after MacArthur repeatedly contradicted the Truman administration's stated policies on the war's conduct, and Barack Obama's acceptance of Stanley McChrystal's resignation in the War in Afghanistan after a \"Rolling Stone\" article was published where he mocked several members of the Obama administration, including Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nDiffering opinions exist as to the desirability of distinguishing the military as a body separate from the larger society. In \"The Soldier and the State\", Huntington argued for what he termed \"objective civilian control\", \"focus[ing] on a politically neutral, autonomous, and professional officer corps\". This autonomous professionalism, it is argued, best inculcates an esprit de corps and sense of distinct military corporateness that prevents political interference by sworn servicemen and -women. Conversely, the tradition of the citizen-soldier holds that \"civilianizing\" the military is the best means of preserving the loyalty of the armed forces towards civilian authorities, by preventing the development of an independent \"caste\" of warriors that might see itself as existing fundamentally apart from the rest of society. In the early history of the United States, according to Michael Cairo,\n[the] principle of civilian control... embodied the idea that every qualified citizen was responsible for the defense of the nation and the defense of liberty, and would go to war, if necessary. Combined with the idea that the military was to embody democratic principles and encourage citizen participation, the only military force suitable to the Founders was a citizen militia, which minimized divisions between officers and the enlisted.\nIn a less egalitarian practice, societies may also blur the line between \"civilian\" and \"military\" leadership by making direct appointments of non-professionals (frequently social elites benefitting from patronage or nepotism) to an officer rank. A more invasive method, most famously practiced in the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China, involves active monitoring of the officer corps through the appointment of political commissars, posted parallel to the uniformed chain of command and tasked with ensuring that national policies are carried out by the armed forces. The regular rotation of soldiers through a variety of different postings is another effective tool for reducing military autonomy, by limiting the potential for soldiers' attachment to any one particular military unit. Some governments place responsibility for approving promotions or officer candidacies with the civilian government, requiring some degree of deference on the part of officers seeking advancement through the ranks.\n\nHistorically, direct control over military forces deployed for war was hampered by the technological limits of command, control, and communications; national leaders, whether democratically elected or not, had to rely on local commanders to execute the details of a military campaign, or risk centrally-directed orders' obsolescence by the time they reached the front lines. The remoteness of government from the action allowed professional soldiers to claim military affairs as their own particular sphere of expertise and influence; upon entering a state of war, it was often expected that the generals and field marshals would dictate strategy and tactics, and the civilian leadership would defer to their informed judgments.\n\nImprovements in information technology and its application to wartime command and control (a process sometimes labeled the \"Revolution in Military Affairs\") has allowed civilian leaders removed from the theater of conflict to assert greater control over the actions of distant military forces. Precision-guided munitions and real-time videoconferencing with field commanders now allow the civilian leadership to intervene even at the tactical decision-making level, designating particular targets for destruction or preservation based on political calculations or the counsel of non-uniformed advisors.\n\nIn the United States the Hatch Act of 1939 does not directly apply to the military, however, Department of Defense Directive 1344.10 (DoDD 1344.10) essentially applies the same rules to the military. This helps to ensure a non-partisan military and ensure smooth and peaceful transitions of power.\n\nPolitical officers screened for appropriate ideology have been integrated into supervisory roles within militaries as a way to maintain the control by political rulers. Historically they are associated most strongly with the Soviet Union and China rather than liberal democracies.\n\nWhile civilian control forms the normative standard in almost every society outside of military dictatorships, its practice has often been the subject of pointed criticism from both uniformed and non-uniformed observers, who object to what they view as the undue \"politicization\" of military affairs, especially when elected officials or political appointees micromanage the military, rather than giving the military general goals and objectives (like \"Defeat Country X\"), and letting the military decide how best to carry those orders out. By placing responsibility for military decision-making in the hands of non-professional civilians, critics argue, the dictates of military strategy are subsumed to the political, with the effect of unduly restricting the fighting capabilities of the nation's armed forces for what should be immaterial or otherwise lower priority concerns.\n\nThe \"Revolt of the Admirals\" that occurred in 1949 was an attempt by senior US Navy personnel, to force a change in budgets directly opposed to the directives given by the Civilian leadership.\n\nU.S. President Bill Clinton faced frequent allegations throughout his time in office (particularly after the Battle of Mogadishu) that he was ignoring military goals out of political and media pressure—a phenomenon termed the \"CNN effect\". Politicians who personally lack military training and experience but who seek to engage the nation in military action may risk resistance and being labeled \"chickenhawks\" by those who disagree with their political goals.\n\nIn contesting these priorities, members of the professional military leadership and their non-uniformed supporters may participate in the bureaucratic bargaining process of the state's policy-making apparatus, engaging in what might be termed a form of regulatory capture as they attempt to restrict the policy options of elected officials when it comes to military matters. An example of one such set of conditions is the \"Weinberger Doctrine\", which sought to forestall another American intervention like that which occurred in the Vietnam War (which had proved disastrous for the morale and fighting integrity of the U.S. military) by proposing that the nation should only go to war in matters of \"vital national interest\", \"as a last resort\", and, as updated by Weinberger's disciple Colin Powell, with \"overwhelming force\". The process of setting military budgets forms another contentious intersection of military and non-military policy, and regularly draws active lobbying by rival military services for a share of the national budget.\n\nNuclear weapons in the U.S. are controlled by the civilian United States Department of Energy, not by the Department of Defense.\n\nDuring the 1990s and 2000s, public controversy over LGBT policy in the U.S. military led to many military leaders and personnel being asked for their opinions on the matter and being given deference although the decision was ultimately not theirs to make.\n\nDuring his tenure, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld raised the ire of the military by attempting to reform its structure away from traditional infantry and toward a lighter, faster, more technologically driven force. In April 2006, Rumsfeld was severely criticized by some retired military officers for his handling of the Iraq War, while other retired military officers came out in support of Rumsfeld. Although no active military officers have spoken out against Rumsfeld, the actions of these officers is still highly unusual. Some news accounts have attributed the actions of these generals to the Vietnam war experience, in which officers did not speak out against the administration's handling of military action. Later in the year, immediately after the November elections in which the Democrats gained control of the Congress, Rumsfeld resigned.\n\nAs of 2015, military dictatorships, where there is \"no\" civilian control of the military, are:\n\nOther countries generally have civilian control of the military, to one degree or another. Strong democratic control of the military is a prerequisite for membership in NATO. Strong democracy and rule of law, implying democratic control of the military, are prerequisites for membership in the European Union.\n\n\n"}

The procedure and requirements for conversion depend on the sponsoring denomination. A conversion in accordance with the process of a denomination is not a guarantee of recognition by another denomination. A formal conversion is also sometimes undertaken by individuals whose Jewish ancestry is questioned, even if they were raised Jewish, but may not actually be considered Jews according to traditional Jewish law.\n\nIn some cases, a person may forgo a formal conversion to Judaism and adopt some or all beliefs and practices of Judaism. However, without a formal conversion, many highly observant Jews will reject a convert's Jewish status.\n\nThere are some groups that have adopted Jewish customs and practices. For example, in Russia the Subbotniks have adopted most aspects of Judaism without formal conversion to Judaism. However, if Subbotniks, or anyone without a formal conversion, wish to marry into a traditional Jewish community or immigrate to Israel, they must have a formal conversion.\n\nThe word \"ger\" comes from the Hebrew verb \"lagur\" (לגור) meaning \"to reside\" or \"to sojourn [with]\". In the Hebrew Bible \"ger\" is defined as a \"foreigner\", or \"sojourner\". Rabbi Marc Angel writes:\nAngel's explanation of the literal meaning of \"ger\" as alien is borne out in biblical verses such as :\nAnother passage which may be relevant to a process of conversion involves non-Jewish women captured in war who could be adopted forcibly as wives (). Another verse which has been interpreted as referring to non-Jews converting to Judaism is Esther 8:17, although no process is described. ().\n\nThe word is rendered by the Greek \"proselyte\" as used in the Septuagint to denote a \"stranger\".\nA male convert to Judaism is referred to by the Hebrew word \"ger\" (, plural \"gerim\") and a female convert is a \"giyoret\". In all branches of Judaism, a ger or giyoret is considered a full Jew, the literal meaning of \"stranger,\" \"resident,\" or \"foreigner\" refers to the convert's origin, not present status. In Karaite Judaism the term \"ger\" only refers to a non-Jew who has yet to fully convert to Judaism, and once converted to Karaitism, is no longer called \"ger\".\n\nIn the Talmud, \"ger\" is used in two senses: \"ger tzedek\" refers to a \"righteous convert\", a proselyte to Judaism, and \"ger toshav\", a non-Jewish inhabitant of the Land of Israel who observes the Seven Laws of Noah and has repudiated all links with idolatry. In Modern Hebrew, the unqualified term \"ger\" means \"ger tzedek\".\n\nAccording to Maimonides, (\"Isurei Biah\" 13:14) converts were accepted since the beginning of Jewish history, and the foreign wives of Jewish leaders - such as Samson and Solomon - were converts. Yet he says (\"Isurei Biah\" 13:15), that in the times of Jewish political power, such as the days of Kings David and Solomon, \"Batei Dinim\" (Jewish courts) did not accept converts, who may have not had the right intention, and they had to wait and prove their intentions to be legally accepted.\n\nNowadays, with the notable exception of some Syrian Jewish communities, (primarily the Brooklyn, NY and Deal, NJ communities), all mainstream forms of Judaism today are open to sincere converts, with all denominations accepting converts converted by their denominations. The rules vary between denominations, as does acceptance of some denomations' converts by other denominations.\n\nFor Rabbinic Judaism, the laws governing conversion (\"gerut\") are based on codes of law and texts, including discussions in the Talmud, through the Shulkhan Arukh and subsequent interpretations. (Many of the guidelines of accepting converts are based on the Book of Ruth and the manner whereby Ruth was brought into the fold through her mother-in-law, Naomi). These rules are held as authoritative by Orthodox Judaism and Conservative Judaism. \n\nWithin Orthodoxy it is commonly understood that Halacha somewhat discourages proselytizing, and religious \"gerut\" is somewhat discouraged. Some rabbis reject potential converts three times, and if they remained adamant in their desire to convert, they would then allow them to begin the process. These practices do not have any solid basis in the written text, and while they may have been the practice in some locations, it was not universal , and a number of rabbis have not followed these practices.\n\nIn order to convert, the conversion candidate must have a circumcision (males) and immerse in the mikveh before a kosher beth din, comprising 3 Jewish males who are shomer Shabbat. There is also a requirement to accept the commandments (although not necessarily a commitment to keep the mitzvot), although without this step there are many authorities who will accept the conversion as valid. In the past it is likely that conversions happened like this, and were decentralized, and universally accepted once performed.\n\nToday, the process has become more centralized, with the conversion candidate having to convince a rabbi and the beth din of their sincerity, and there will usually be a considerable amount of study. They will then be tested and formally accepted, the convert is issued with a \"Shtar geirut\" (\"Certificate of Conversion\"). As the conversion process becomes more centralized there are only a limited number of conversion courts that are 'acceptable' to the Chief Rabbinate of Israel.\n\nHowever there are a number of rabbis who are willing to conduct decentralized conversions today, and are recognized by each other. Two of the more prominent of these rabbis are Chuck Davidson and Haim Amsalem.\n\nConservative Judaism takes a more lenient approach in application of the \"halakhic\" rules than Modern Orthodox Judaism. Its approach to the validity of conversions is based on whether the conversion procedure followed rabbinic norms, rather than the reliability of those performing it or the nature of the obligations the convert undertook. Accordingly, it may accept the validity of some Reform and Reconstructionist conversions, but only if they include immersion in a ritual bath (mikvah), appearance before a rabbinical court (beit din) and, for men, circumcision (\"brit milah\") or a symbolic circumcision for those already circumcised (\"hatafat dam brit\").\n\nThe requirements of Reform Judaism for conversions are different. The denomination states that \"people considering conversion are expected to study Jewish theology, rituals, history, culture and customs, and to begin incorporating Jewish practices into their lives. The length and format of the course of study will vary from rabbi to rabbi and community to community, though most now require a course in basic Judaism and individual study with a rabbi, as well as attendance at services and participation in home practice and synagogue life.\"\n\nAlthough an infant conversion might be accepted in some circumstances (such as in the case of adopted children or children whose parents convert), children who convert would typically be asked if they want to remain Jewish after reaching religious adulthood – which is 12 years of age for a girl and 13 for a boy. This standard is applied by Orthodox and Conservative Judaism, which accept halakha as binding.\n\nReconstructionist Judaism values the symbolism of the conversion ritual, and encourages those who were not born of Jewish parents and who wish to convert to undergo this rite of passage. The Reconstructionist course of study for a prospective convert, which is determined by the rabbi and congregation the individual is working with, includes history, observance and beliefs, and learning how to make educated choices. The completion of the process is marked by ritual immersion for men and women; circumcision or hatafat dam brit (symbolic drop of blood) for men (unless there exists an extraordinary physical or emotional hazard); a Bet Din (a dialogue with three knowledgeable Jews, at least one of whom is a rabbi), and often a public welcoming ceremony.\n\nKaraite Judaism does not accept Rabbinic Judaism and has different requirements for conversion. Traditionally non-proselytizing, Karaite Judaism's long standing abstention from conversions was recently lifted. On 1 August 2007, the Karaites reportedly converted their first new members in 500 years. At a ceremony in their Northern California synagogue, ten adults and four minors swore fealty to Judaism after completing a year of study. This conversion comes 15 years after the Karaite Council of Sages reversed its centuries-old ban on accepting converts.\n\nThe Amoraim who produced the Talmud set out three requirements for a conversion to Judaism (Keritot 8b), which must be witnessed and affirmed by a \"beth din hedyot\" rabbinical court composed of three Jewish males above the age of thirteen (they do not need to be rabbis):\n\nThe consensus of \"halakhic\" authorities also requires a convert to understand and accept the duties of the classical Jewish law. This is not stated explicitly in the Talmud, but was inferred by subsequent commentators.\n\nAfter confirming that all these requirements have been met, the \"beth din\" issues a \"Certificate of Conversion\" (\"Shtar Giur\"), certifying that the person is now a Jew.\n\nAccording to the Jewish Encyclopedia article on circumcision of proselytes, in the 1st century CE, before the Mishnah was edited, the requirement for circumcision of proselytes was an open issue between the zealots and liberal parties in ancient Israel. R. Joshua argued that besides accepting Jewish beliefs and laws, a prospective convert to Judaism must undergo immersion in a mikveh. In contrast, R. Eliezer makes circumcision a condition for the conversion. A similar controversy between the Shammaites and the Hillelites is given regarding a proselyte born without a foreskin: the former demanding the spilling of a drop of blood symbolic of the Brit Milah, thereby entering into the covenant; the latter declaring it to be unnecessary.\n\nIn discussions about the necessity of circumcision for those born of a Jewish mother, lending some support to the need for circumcision of converts, the Midrash states: \"If thy sons accept My Godhead [by undergoing circumcision] I shall be their God and bring them into the land; but if they do not observe My covenant in regard either to circumcision or to the Sabbath, they shall not enter the land of promise\" (Midrash Genesis Rabbah xlvi). \"The Sabbath-keepers who are not circumcised are intruders, and deserve punishment,\" (Midrash Deut. Rabbah i).\n\nHowever, the opposing view is supported in the Babylonian Talmud: \"A male convert who has been immersed but not circumcised, or circumcised but not immersed, is a convert.\"\n\nFlavius Josephus in Jewish Antiquities Book 20 Chapter 2 recorded the story of King Izates of Adiabene who decided to follow the Law of Moses at the advice of a Jewish merchant named Ananias. He was going to get circumcised, but his mother, Helen, who herself embraced the Jewish customs, advised against it on the grounds that the subjects would not stand to be ruled by someone who followed such \"strange and foreign rites\". Ananias likewise advised against it, on the grounds that worship of God was superior to circumcision (Robert Eisenman in \"James the Brother of Jesus\" claims that Ananias is Paul of Tarsus who held similar views, although this is a novel interpretation lacking support in mainstream scholarship) and that God would forgive him for fear of his subjects. So Izates decided against it. However, later, \"a certain other Jew that came out of Galilee, whose name was Eleazar\", who was well versed in the Law, convinced him that he should, on the grounds that it was one thing to read the Law and another thing to practice it, and so he did. Once Helen and Ananias found out, they were struck by great fear of the possible consequences, but as Josephus put it, God looked after Izates. As his reign was peaceful and blessed, Helen visited the Jerusalem Temple to thank God, and since there was a terrible famine at the time, she brought lots of food and aid to the people of Jerusalem.\n\nThe requirements for conversions vary somewhat within the different branches of Judaism, so whether or not a conversion is recognized by another denomination is often an issue fraught with religious politics. The Orthodox rejection of non-Orthodox conversions is derived less from qualms with the conversion process itself, since Conservative and even some Reform conversions are ostensibly very similar to Orthodox conversions with respect to duration and content, but rather from that the convert was presumably not properly (i.e. according to tradition) instructed in Jewish Law, and the procedure of conversion has a chance of not having been done properly, and that those overseeing the process were (almost certainly) not qualified to test the convert (and in any case would have had different answers).\n\nIn general, immersion in the mikveh is an important part of a traditional conversion. If the person who is converting is male, circumcision is a part of the traditional conversion process as well. If the male who is converting has already been circumcised, then a ritual removal of a single drop of blood will take place (\"hatafat dam brit\"). However, more liberal branches of Judaism have a more relaxed requirement of immersion and circumcision.\n\nSomeone who was converted to Judaism as a child has an option of rejecting this after reaching the age of maturity, which in Judaism is age twelve for girls or thirteen for boys.\n\nIn the United States of America, Reform Judaism rejects the concept that any rules or rituals should be considered necessary for conversion to Judaism. In the late 19th century, the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the official body of American Reform rabbis, formally resolved to permit the admission of converts \"without any initiatory rite, ceremony, or observance whatsoever\". (CCAR Yearbook 3 (1893), 73–95; \"American Reform Responsa\" (ARR), no. 68, at 236–237.)\n\nAlthough this resolution has often been examined critically by many Reform rabbis, the resolution still remains the official policy of American Reform Judaism (CCAR Responsa \"Circumcision for an Eight-Year-Old Convert\" 5756.13 and Solomon Freehof, \"Reform Responsa for Our Time\", no. 15.) Thus, American Reform Judaism does not require ritual immersion in a mikveh, circumcision, or acceptance of mitzvot as normative. Appearance before a Bet Din is recommended, but is not considered necessary. Converts are asked to commit to religious standards set by the local Reform community.\n\nIn actual practice, the requirements for conversion of any individual are determined by the Rabbi who sponsors the convert. Typically, Reform Rabbis require prospective converts to take a course of study in Judaism, such as an \"Introduction to Judaism\" course, to participate in worship at a synagogue, and to live as a Jew (however that is interpreted by the individual Rabbi) for a period of time. A period of one year is common, although individual Rabbis' requirements vary. When the sponsoring Rabbi feels that the candidate is ready, a Bet Din may be convened. Other rituals such as immersion in a mikvah, circumcision (or Hatafat dam brit), and a public ceremony to celebrate the conversion, are also at the discretion of the Rabbi.\n\nIn response to the tremendous variations that exist within the Reform community, the Conservative Jewish movement attempted to set a nuanced approach. The Conservative Committee on Jewish Law and Standards has issued a legal opinion stating that Reform conversions may be accepted as valid only when they include the minimal Conservative halachic requirements of milah and t'vilah, appearance before a Conservative Bet Din, and a course of Conservative study. (\"Proceedings of Committee on Jewish Law and Standards: 1980–1985\", pp. 77–101.)\n\nIn general, branches of Orthodox Judaism consider non-Orthodox conversions either inadequate or of questionable halachic compliance, and such conversions are therefore not accepted by these branches of Judaism. Conversely, both Conservative and Reform Judaism accept the stringent Orthodox conversion process as being valid. Since 2008, Haredi Orthodox religious courts in Israel have been rejecting conversions even from some other Orthodox rabbis, in addition to Reform and Conservative conversions, as not being stringent enough.\n\nIn 2008, a Haredi-dominated Badatz in Israel annulled thousands of conversions performed by the Military Rabbinate in Israel. The Chief Rabbinate of Israel, which is the only state-recognized authority on religious matters, backed by Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, ruled against this, making it legally invalid for purposes of Israeli law.\n\nThere are two orthodox conversion programmes in Montreal. One is made up of a \"Bet Din\" (Jewish Court) of congregational member rabbis from the Rabbinical Council of America, Montreal region (RCA). This program provides a way to convert according to the rigorous rules of Halachah while making the process more \"user friendly\" for non-Jewish individuals seeking a more \"hands-on\" or \"modern Orthodox\" approach. The second program is supervised by the Jewish Community Council of Montreal, the \"Vaad Hair\".\n\nAll conversion candidates—who could include singles, non-Jewish couples and adoption cases—must have a sponsoring rabbi and undergo a rigorous screening process. Conversions stemming from both programs are recognized in Israel and around the world.\n\nAs of 2006, the \"Moetzet Hakhamim\" (Council of Sages) began to accept converts to Karaite Judaism through the Karaite Jewish University. The process requires one year of learning, circumcision (for males), and the taking of the vow that Ruth took.\n\"For whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge; thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God; where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried; the do so to me, and more also, if aught but death part thee and me.\" \nIn the 1950s Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik and other members of the Rabbinical Council of America engaged in a series of private negotiations with the leaders of Conservative Judaism's Rabbinical Assembly, including Saul Lieberman; their goal was to create a joint Orthodox-Conservative national beth din for all Jews in the United States. It would create communal standards of marriage and divorce. It was to be modeled after the Israeli Chief Rabbinate, where all the judges would have been Orthodox, while it would have been accepted by the larger Conservative movement as legitimate. Conservative rabbis in the Rabbinical Assembly created a \"Joint Conference on Jewish Law\", devoting a year to this effort.\n\nFor a number of reasons, the project did not succeed. According to Orthodox Rabbi Louis Bernstein, the major reason for its failure was the Orthodox rabbis' insistence that the Conservative Rabbinical Assembly agree to expel Conservative rabbis for actions they took prior to the formation of the new beth din, and the RA refused to do so. According to Orthodox Rabbi Emanuel Rackman, former president of the RCA, the major reason for its failure was pressure from haredi Orthodox rabbis, who held that any cooperation between Orthodoxy and Conservatism was forbidden. In 1956, Rabbi Harry Halpern, of the \"Joint Conference\" wrote a report on the demise of this beth din. He writes that negotiations between the Orthodox and Conservative denominations were completed and agreed upon, but then a new requirement was demanded by the RCA: The RA must \"impose severe sanctions\" upon Conservative rabbis for actions they took before this new beth din was formed. Halpern writes that the RA \"could not assent to rigorously disciplining our members at the behest of an outside group\". He goes on to write that although subsequent efforts were made to cooperate with the Orthodox, a letter from eleven Rosh Yeshivas was circulated declaring that Orthodox rabbis are forbidden to cooperate with Conservative rabbis.\n\nIn Denver, Colorado, a joint Orthodox, Traditional, Conservative and Reform Bet Din was formed to promote uniform standards for conversion to Judaism. A number of rabbis were Orthodox and had \"semicha\" from Orthodox yeshivas, but were serving in synagogues without a mechitza; these synagogues were called \"traditional Judaism\". Over a five-year period they performed some 750 conversions to Judaism. However, in 1983 the joint Beth Din was dissolved, due to the unilateral American Reform Jewish decision to change the definition of Jewishness.\n\nSpecifically, in 1983, the Central Conference of American Rabbis passed a resolution waiving the need for formal conversion for anyone with at least one Jewish parent who has made affirmative acts of Jewish identity. This departed from the traditional position requiring formal conversion to Judaism for children without a Jewish mother. The 1983 resolution of the American Reform movement has had a mixed reception in Reform Jewish communities outside of the United States. Most notably, the Israel Movement for Progressive Judaism has rejected patrilineal descent and requires formal conversion for anyone without a Jewish mother. However, in 2015 the majority of Britain's Assembly of Reform Rabbis voted in favor of a position paper proposing \"that individuals who live a Jewish life, and who are patrilineally Jewish, can be welcomed into the Jewish community and confirmed as Jewish through an individual process\". Britain's Assembly of Reform Rabbis stated that rabbis \"would be able to take local decisions – ratified by the Beit Din – confirming Jewish status\".\n\nThe end of the joint Beth Din program was welcomed by Haredi Orthodox groups, who saw the program as illegitimate. Further, Haredi groups attempted to prevent non-Orthodox rabbis from following the traditional requirements of converts using a mikveh. In the Haredi view, it is better to have no conversion at all than a non-Orthodox conversion, as all non-Orthodox conversions are not true conversions at all according to them.\n\nIn the 1980s Orthodox Rabbi Norman Lamm, Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshiva University, along with other American and Israeli Orthodox rabbis, worked with Conservative and Reform rabbis to come up with solution to the \"Who is a Jew?\" issue. In 1989 and 1990 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir spearheaded an effort to find a way to resolve the impasse.\n\nA plan was developed by Israeli Cabinet Secretary Elyakim Rubenstein, who negotiated secretly for many months with rabbis from Conservative, Reform and Orthodox Judaism, including faculty at Yeshiva University, with Lamm as \"Rosh Yeshiva\". They were planning to create a joint panel that interviewed people who were converting to Judaism and considering making \"aliyah\" (moving to the State of Israel), and would refer them to a beth din that would convert the candidate following traditional halakha. All negotiating parties came to agreement:\n\nMany Reform rabbis took offense at the notion that the \"beth din\" must be strictly halakhic and Orthodox, but they acquiesced. However, when word about this project became public, a number of leading haredi rabbis issued a statement denouncing the project, condemning it as a \"travesty of halakha\". Rabbi Moshe Sherer, Chairman of Agudath Israel World Organization, stated that \"Yes we played a role in putting an end to that farce, and I'm proud we did\". Norman Lamm condemned this interference by Sherer, stating that this was \"the most damaging thing that he [Sherer] ever did in his forty year career\".\n\nRabbi Lamm wanted this to be only the beginning of a solution to Jewish disunity. He stated that had this unified conversion plan not been destroyed, he wanted to extend this program to the area of halakhic Jewish divorces, thus ending the problem of \"mamzerut\".\n\nIn 1997 the issue of \"Who is a Jew?\" again arose in the State of Israel, and Orthodox leaders such as Rabbi Norman Lamm publicly backed the Neeman commission, a group of Orthodox, Conservative and Reform rabbis working to develop joint programs for conversion to Judaism. In 1997 Lamm gave a speech at the World Council of Orthodox Leadership, in Glen Springs, N.Y., urging Orthodox Jews to support this effort.\n\nThe committee recommended the establishment of a joint institute for Jewish studies, which would be a joint effort by all three streams of Judaism. The Committee also recommended that conversion proceedings themselves be held in special conversion courts, to be recognized by all denominations in Judaism. The purpose of the proposal was to prevent a rift in the Jewish people, while at the same time bringing about a state-sponsored arrangement for conversion. On September 7, 1998, the government adopted the Ne'eman Commission Report.\n\nA year later, the Joint Institute for Jewish Studies was established, and since then it has been the official state operator of conversion courses in Israel, including the military conversion courses. In 2015 the institute's name was changed to Nativ – The National Center for Jewish Studies, Identity and Conversion.\n\nA recent development has been the concept of annulling conversions to Judaism, sometimes many years after they have taken place, due to a reduction in religious observance or change of community by the convert. This is unknown in rabbinic literature, where conversion is considered irreversible. Chuck Davidson, a Modern Orthodox expert on this conversion crisis explains \"From the Middle Ages onwards, the greatest of the rabbis wrote explicitly that even if immediately after the conversion the convert goes off to worship idols, the person is still considered Jewish\". The justification given for the change in approach is that the original conversion must never have been valid in the first place as it is clear from the convert's subsequent actions they were insincere at the time of conversion.\n\nA situation of confusion and instability in Jewish identity in Israel was made worse when Haredi Rabbi Avraham Sherman of Israel's supreme religious court called into question the validity of over 40,000 Jewish conversions when he upheld a ruling by the Ashdod Rabbinical Court to retroactively annul the conversion of a woman who came before them because in their eyes she failed to observe Jewish law (an orthodox lifestyle).\n\nThis crisis deepened, when Israel's Rabbinate called into question the validity of soldiers who had undergone conversion in the army, meaning a soldier killed in action could not be buried according to Jewish law. In 2010, the rabbinate created a further distrust in the conversion process when it began refusing to recognize orthodox converts from the United States as Jewish. Indeed, the great-niece of the renowned Zionist Nahum Sokolow was recently deemed \"not Jewish enough\" to marry in Israel, after she failed to prove the purity of Jewish blood for four generations.\n\nFollowing a scandal in which U.S. Rabbi Barry Freundel was arrested on charges of installing hidden cameras in a mikveh to film women converts undressing, the Israeli Chief Rabbinate said it would review the validity of all past conversions performed by Freundel, then quickly reversed its decision, clarifying that it was joining the Orthodox Rabbinical Council of America in affirming the validity of the conversions.\n\nIn December 2014 an Israeli court decided that a conversion could be annulled. In his decision Justice Neal Hendel wrote: \"Just as the civil court has the inalienable authority to reverse — in extremely rare cases — a final judgment, so too does the special religious conversion court. For otherwise, we would allow for judgments that are flawed from their inception to exist eternally.\"\n\nOnce undergone, a valid religious conversion to Judaism cannot be overturned. However, a Beth Din may determine that the conversion is void as it was never undertaken correctly in the first place. For example, if the rite of mikveh was performed incorrectly. In recent years many Orthodox conversions have been overturned. In 2008 Israel's highest religious court invalidated the conversion of 40,000 Jews, mostly from Russian immigrant families, even though they had been approved by an Orthodox rabbi. Debate on what constitutes a valid Beth Din for conversion and for annulling conversions has caused divisions in the Orthodox world. It is an implicit judgment on the character and uprightness of the rabbis in that religious court. For example, when Rabbi Barry Freundel was arrested on charges of voyeurism for filming women converts at the mikveh he supervised, Israel's Chief Rabbinate initially threatened to review and possibly invalidate the conversions Freundel had been involved in approving. A crisis between American and Israeli rabbis was averted when the Chief Rabbinate agreed that all conversions completed by Freundel would be considered valid.\n\nJudaism is not currently an openly proselytizing religion. Judaism teaches that the righteous of all nations have a place in the afterlife. Much like in the other Abrahamic faiths, Jewish law requires the sincerity of a potential convert, but takes it to a much more serious and formal level. In view of the foregoing considerations, most authorities are very careful about it. Essentially, they want to be sure that the convert knows what they are getting into, and that they are doing it for sincerely religious reasons. However, while conversion for the sake of love for Judaism is considered the best motivation, a conversion for the sake of avoiding intermarriage is gaining acceptance also.\n\nThere is a tradition that a prospective convert should be turned away three times as a test of sincerity, though most rabbis no longer follow the tradition. Neither the Rabbinical Council of America nor the Rabbinical Assembly, the leading American Orthodox and Conservative organizations suggest taking this action in their conversion policies, with the Central Conference of American Rabbis (CCAR) and Union for Reform Judaism (URJ) actively opposing its practice.\n\nHalakha forbids the mistreatment of a convert, including reminding a convert that he or she was once not a Jew. Hence, little to no distinction is made in Judaism between those who are born Jewish and those who are Jewish as a result of conversion. However, despite Halakha protecting the rights of converts, some Jewish communities have been accused of treating converts as second-class Jews. For example, many communities of Syrian Jews have banned conversion and refuse to recognise any Jewish conversion, including those done under Orthodox auspices (possibly influenced by sects in Syria like the Druze which do not accept converts).\n\nAccording to Orthodox interpretations of Halakha, converts face a limited number of restrictions. A marriage between a female convert and a kohen (members of the priestly class) is prohibited and any children of the union do not inherit their father's kohen status. While a Jew by birth may not marry a mamzer, a convert can. Converts can become rabbis. For instance, Rabbi Meir Baal Ha Nes is thought to be a descendant of a proselyte. Rabbi Akiva was also a very well known son of converts. The Talmud lists many of the Jewish nation's greatest leaders who had either descended from or were themselves converts. In fact, King David is descended from Ruth, a convert to Judaism.() In Orthodox and Conservative communities which maintain tribal distinctions, converts become \"Yisraelim\" (Israelites), ordinary Jews with no tribal or inter-Jewish distinctions. Converts typically follow the customs of their congregations. So a convert who prays at a Sephardi synagogue would follow Sephardi customs and learn Sephardi Hebrew.\n\nA convert chooses his or her own Hebrew first name upon conversion but is traditionally known as the son or daughter of Abraham and Sarah, the first patriarch and matriarch in the Torah, often with the additional qualifier of \"Avinu\" (our father) and \"Imenu\" (our mother). Hence, a convert named Akiva would be known, for ritual purposes in a synagogue, as \"Akiva ben Avraham Avinu\"; in cases where the mother's name is used, such as for the prayer for recovery from an illness, he would be known as \"Akiva ben Sarah Imenu\".\n\nTalmudic opinions on converts are numerous; some positive, some negative. A quote from the Talmud labels the convert \"hard on Israel as a scab\". Many interpretations explain this quote as meaning converts can be unobservant and lead Jews to be unobservant, or converts can be so observant that born Jews feel ashamed.\n\nThe term \"Jew by choice\" is often used to describe someone who, with no ancestral connection to the Jewish people, chose to convert to Judaism. It is often contrasted with such terms as \"Jew by birth\" (or \"Jew by chance\"). The practice of conversion to Judaism is sometimes understood within Orthodox Judaism in terms of reincarnation. According to this school of thought in Judaism, when non-Jews are drawn to Judaism, it is because they had been Jews in a former life. Such souls may \"wander among nations\" through multiple lives, until they find their way back to Judaism, including through finding themselves born in a gentile family with a \"lost\" Jewish ancestor.\n\nIn recent decades, there has been a renewed Jewish conversion interest with some Bnei Anusim, that is, the descendants of Jews who were forced to convert to other faiths.\n\nThe Hebrew term for forced converts is \"Anusim\" (lit. \"[the] forced [converts]\"), while the descendants of said converts are called \"Bnei Anusim\" (lit. \"[the] children [of the] forced [converts]\").\n\nIn the modern era, the single most notable and numerous group of Bnei Anusim converts are the Sephardic Bnei Anusim, descendants of those Sephardic Jews who were forced to convert to Christianity during the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisition. They are found throughout Iberia (Spain and Portugal) and Iberoamerica (the Hispanic countries of the Americas plus Brazil). There has been a continuous steady growth among them who are now prospective converts, actively seeking conversions back to Judaism.\n\nSince many Bnei Anusim (i.e. descendants of forced converts) lack an unbroken matrilineal Jewish line of descent or lack satisfactory documentary evidence to that effect (even if they can prove Jewish ancestry along one or all other of their lineages besides their direct matrilineal lineage), conversion has been a growing option for them to return to Judaism.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "218116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=218116", "title": "Enabling Act of 1933", "text": "Enabling Act of 1933\n\nThe Enabling Act (German: \"\") of 1933, formally titled (\"Law to Remedy the Distress of People and Reich\"), was an amendment to the Weimar Constitution that gave the German Cabinet — in effect, Chancellor Adolf Hitler — the power to enact laws without the involvement of the Reichstag. The Enabling Act gave Hitler plenary powers and followed on the heels of the Reichstag Fire Decree, which had abolished most civil liberties and transferred state powers to the Reich government. The combined effect of the two laws was to transform Hitler's government into a legal dictatorship.\n\nThe act passed in both the Reichstag and Reichsrat on 23 March 1933, and was signed by President Paul von Hindenburg later that day. The act stated that it was to last four years unless renewed by the Reichstag, which occurred twice. \n\nThe law was enacted by the Reichstag (meeting at the Kroll Opera House), where non-Nazi members were surrounded and threatened by members of SA and SS. The Communists had already been repressed and were not allowed to be present or to vote, and some Social Democrats were kept away as well. In the end, most of those present voted for the act, except for the Social Democrats, who voted against it.\n\nAfter being appointed chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933, Hitler asked President von Hindenburg to dissolve the Reichstag. A general election was scheduled for 5 March 1933. A secret meeting was held between Hitler and 20 to 25 industrialists at the official residence of Hermann Göring in the Reichstag Presidential Palace aimed at financing the election campaign of the Nazi Party.\n\nThe burning of the Reichstag, depicted by the Nazis as the beginning of a communist revolution, resulted in the presidential Reichstag Fire Decree, which among other things suspended freedom of press and \"habeas corpus\" rights just five days before the election. Hitler used the decree to have the Communist Party's offices raided and its representatives arrested, effectively eliminating them as a political force.\n\nAlthough they received five million more votes than in the previous election, the Nazis failed to gain an absolute majority in parliament, and depended on the 8% of seats won by their coalition partner, the German National People's Party, to reach 52% in total.\n\nTo free himself from this dependency, Hitler had the cabinet, in its first post-election meeting on 15 March, draw up plans for an Enabling Act which would give the cabinet legislative power for four years. The Nazis devised the Enabling Act to gain complete political power without the need of the support of a majority in the Reichstag and without the need to bargain with their coalition partners.\n\nThe Enabling Act allowed the cabinet to enact legislation, including laws deviating from or altering the constitution, without the consent of the Reichstag. Because this law allowed for departures from the constitution, it was itself considered a constitutional amendment. Thus, its passage required the support of two-thirds of those deputies who were present and voting. A quorum of two-thirds of the entire Reichstag was required to be present in order to call up the bill.\n\nThe Social Democrats (SPD) and the Communists (KPD) were expected to vote against the Act. The government had already arrested all Communist and some Social Democrat deputies under the Reichstag Fire Decree. The Nazis expected the parties representing the middle class, the Junkers and business interests to vote for the measure, as they had grown weary of the instability of the Weimar Republic and would not dare to resist.\n\nHitler believed that with the Centre Party members' votes, he would get the necessary two-thirds majority. Hitler negotiated with the Centre Party's chairman, Ludwig Kaas, a Catholic priest, finalising an agreement by 22 March. Kaas agreed to support the Act in exchange for assurances of the Centre Party's continued existence, the protection of Catholics' civil and religious liberties, religious schools and the retention of civil servants affiliated with the Centre Party. It has also been suggested that some members of the SPD were intimidated by the presence of the Nazi Sturmabteilung (SA) throughout the proceedings.\n\nSome historians, such as Klaus Scholder, have maintained that Hitler also promised to negotiate a Reichskonkordat with the Holy See, a treaty that formalised the position of the Catholic Church in Germany on a national level. Kaas was a close associate of Cardinal Pacelli, then Vatican Secretary of State (and later Pope Pius XII). Pacelli had been pursuing a German concordat as a key policy for some years but the instability of Weimar governments as well as the enmity of some parties to such a treaty rendered the project moot. The day after the Enabling Act vote, Kaas went to Rome in order to, in his own words, \"investigate the possibilities for a comprehensive understanding between church and state\". However, so far no evidence for a link between the Enabling Act and the Reichskonkordat signed on 20 July 1933 has surfaced.\n\nAs with most of the laws passed in the process of \"Gleichschaltung\", the Enabling Act is quite short, especially considering its implications. The full text, in German and English, follows:\n\nArticles 1 and 4 gave the government the right to draw up the budget and approve treaties without input from the Reichstag.\n\nDebate within the Centre Party continued until the day of the vote, 23 March 1933, with Kaas advocating voting in favour of the act, referring to an upcoming written guarantee from Hitler, while former Chancellor Heinrich Brüning called for a rejection of the Act. The majority sided with Kaas, and Brüning agreed to maintain party discipline by voting for the Act.\n\nThe Reichstag, led by its President, Hermann Göring, changed its rules of procedure to make it easier to pass the bill. Under the Weimar Constitution, a quorum of two-thirds of the entire Reichstag membership was required to be present in order to bring up a constitutional amendment bill. In this case, 432 of the Reichstag's 647 deputies would have normally been required for a quorum. However, Göring reduced the quorum to 378 by not counting the 81 KPD deputies. Despite the virulent rhetoric directed against the Communists, the Nazis did not formally ban the KPD right away. Not only did they fear a violent uprising, but they hoped the KPD's presence on the ballot would siphon off votes from the SPD. However, it was an open secret that the KPD deputies would never be allowed to take their seats; they were thrown in jail as quickly as the police could track them down. Courts began taking the line that since the Communists were responsible for the fire, KPD membership was an act of treason. Thus, for all intents and purposes, the KPD was banned as of 6 March, the day after the election.\n\nGöring also declared that any deputy who was \"absent without excuse\" was to be considered as present, in order to overcome obstructions. Leaving nothing to chance, the Nazis used the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to detain several SPD deputies. A few others saw the writing on the wall and fled into exile.\n\nLater that day, the Reichstag assembled under intimidating circumstances, with SA men swarming inside and outside the chamber. Hitler's speech, which emphasised the importance of Christianity in German culture, was aimed particularly at appeasing the Centre Party's sensibilities and incorporated Kaas' requested guarantees almost verbatim. Kaas gave a speech, voicing the Centre's support for the bill amid \"concerns put aside\", while Brüning notably remained silent.\n\nOnly SPD chairman Otto Wels spoke against the Act, declaring that the proposed bill could not \"destroy ideas which are eternal and indestructible.\" Kaas had still not received the written constitutional guarantees he had negotiated, but with the assurance it was being \"typed up\", voting began. Kaas never received the letter.\n\nAt this stage, the majority of deputies already supported the bill, and any deputies who might have been reluctant to vote in favour were intimidated by the SA troops surrounding the meeting. In the end, all parties except the SPD voted in favour of the Enabling Act. With the KPD banned and 26 SPD deputies arrested or in hiding, the final tally was 444 in favour of the Enabling Act against 94 (all Social Democrats) opposed. The Reichstag had adopted the Enabling Act with the support of 83% of the deputies. If all SPD deputies had been present, it would have still passed with 78.7% support. The same day in the evening, the Reichsrat also gave its approval, unanimously and without prior discussion. The Act was then signed into law by President Hindenburg.\n\nUnder the Act, the government had acquired the authority to pass laws without either parliamentary consent or control. These laws could (with certain exceptions) even deviate from the Constitution. The Act effectively eliminated the Reichstag as active players in German politics. While its existence was protected by the Enabling Act, for all intents and purposes it reduced the Reichstag to a mere stage for Hitler's speeches. It only met sporadically until the end of World War II, held no debates and enacted only a few laws. Within three months of the passage of the Enabling Act, all parties except the Nazi Party were banned or pressured into dissolving themselves, followed on 14 July by a law that made the Nazi Party the only legally permitted party in the country. With this, Hitler had fulfilled what he had promised in earlier campaign speeches: \"I set for myself one aim ... to sweep these thirty parties out of Germany!\"\n\nDuring the negotiations between the government and the political parties, it was agreed that the government should inform the Reichstag parties of legislative measures passed under the Enabling Act. For this purpose, a working committee was set up, co-chaired by Hitler and Centre Party chairman Kaas. However, this committee met only three times without any major impact, and rapidly became a dead letter even before all other parties were banned.\n\nThough the Act had formally given legislative powers to the government as a whole, these powers were for all intents and purposes exercised by Hitler himself. After its passage, there were no longer serious deliberations in Cabinet meetings. Its meetings became more and more infrequent after 1934, and it never met in full after 1938.\n\nDue to the great care that Hitler took to give his dictatorship an appearance of legality, the Enabling Act was renewed twice, in 1937 and 1941. However, its renewal was practically assured since all other parties were banned. Voters were presented with a single list of Nazis and Nazi-approved \"guest\" candidates under far-from-secret conditions. In 1942, the Reichstag passed a law giving Hitler power of life and death over every citizen, effectively extending the provisions of the Enabling Act for the duration of the war.\n\nIronically, two, and possibly three, of the penultimate measures Hitler took to consolidate his power in 1934 violated the Enabling Act. In February 1934, the Reichsrat, representing the states, was abolished even though Article 2 of the Enabling Act specifically protected the existence of both the Reichstag and the Reichsrat. It can be argued that the Enabling Act had been breached two weeks earlier by the Law for the Reconstruction of the Reich, which transferred the states' powers to the Reich and effectively left the Reichsrat impotent. Article 2 stated that laws passed under the Enabling Act could not affect the institutions of either chamber. In August, Hindenburg died, and Hitler seized the president's powers for himself in accordance with a law passed the previous day. Article 2 stated that the president's powers were to remain \"undisturbed,\" which has long been interpreted to mean that it forbade Hitler from tampering with the presidency. A 1932 amendment to the constitution made the president of the High Court of Justice, not the chancellor, first in the line of succession to the presidency—and even then on an interim basis pending new elections. However, the Enabling Act provided no remedy for any violations of Article 2, and these actions were never challenged in court.\n\nBritish historian Richard J. Evans in his book, \"The Coming of the Third Reich\", argued that the Enabling Act may have been invalid. He contended that Göring's refusal to even acknowledge the Communist seats for the purposes of a quorum was an \"illegal act.\" (It should be noted that even if the Communists had been present and voting, the Act would have still passed with, at the very least, 68.7 percent support.) He also argued that the act's passage in the Reichsrat was tainted by the overthrow of the state governments.\n\nThe film \"\" contains a scene portraying the passage of the Enabling Act. The portrayal in the film is inaccurate, with the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree (which in practice, as the name states, was a decree issued by President Hindenburg weeks before the Enabling Act) merged into the Act. Non-Nazi members of the Reichstag, including Vice-Chancellor von Papen, are shown objecting. In reality the Act met little resistance, with only the centre-left Social Democratic Party voting against passage.\n\nThe same film also shows Hermann Göring, the then speaker of the house, begin singing \"Deutschlandlied\". Nazi representatives then stand and immediately join in with Göring; bizarrely, all other party members join in too, with everyone performing the Hitler salute. In reality, this never happened.\n"}

The order also applies to employees of the government of the District of Columbia, and the United States Postal Service. However, it does not apply to positions and agencies in the excepted service, such as the Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\nIn a statement issued the same day that he signed the order, President Clinton said: \nFederal employees cannot appeal claims of discrimination under Executive Order 13087 to the EEOC, but they can file complaints under the grievance procedure of the agency where they work and, under certain conditions, may appeal their claims to the Merit Systems Protection Board or the Office of Special Counsel. \n\nClinton had previously included \"sexual orientation\" in Executive Order 12968 (1995) when listing the characteristics forbidden as the basis for discrimination when granting federal employees access to classified information.\n\nThe order applied to civilian employees of the American military, but not to uniformed members of the armed forces, who, at the time, were covered by the Don't ask, don't tell directive issued by Clinton in 1993.\n\nOpponents in Congress objected to the Order and said that it provided special privileges and \"special breaks for special interests,\" Donald Devine, who headed the Office of Personnel Management from 1981 to 1995, criticized Clinton's decision to implement the non-discrimination policy by issuing an Executive Order, \"issued out of the glare of public attention,\" and called on Congress to act to undo the President's action \"before it can do much damage both to the orderly management of the government and to its equal employment policies generally.\" On June 11, 1998, the conservative Southern Baptist Convention passed a resolution asking the President to rescind the order and demanding that Congress nullify it if he did not do so. Later in 1998, several congressmen, including Republicans Bob Barr of Georgia and Joel Hefley of Colorado, introduced bills designed to overturn 13087 or to prohibit government agencies from spending any funds to enforce it. In August 1998, an amendment to the Commerce, Justice, State, Judiciary, and Related Agencies appropriations bill that sought to prohibit spending on behalf of 13087 failed in the House of Representatives on a vote of 176 to 252, the only recorded vote on the issue.\n\nAccording to the Equal Opportunity Commission:\n\nIn 2005, the Human Rights Campaign and others claimed that \"the head of the Office of Special Counsel, Scott Bloch, refuses to enforce these longstanding non-discrimination protections.\"\n\n\n"}

The GLC is the oldest government law center in the United States, conducting research and education in law and public policy. The Center's areas of expertise include land use planning and zoning, environment, government ethics, local government, aging, public authorities, Chinese Law, racing and gaming, early stage business support for alternate energy, and civilian police review. \n\nThe GLC's principal mission is to conduct programs and research that inform the public policy debate through non-partisan, comprehensive analysis of critical government-related issues. The GLC provides research and technical assistance to public officials and presents instruction for the general public.\n\nThe GLC has published a number of reports online at \"Government Law Online\". The Center offers fellowships and internships for students to enhance their academic learning. The current interim Director of the center is Robert Heverly. Beginning in August 2013, Raymond Brescia will take over as Director. \n\n<br>\nThe Government Law Center was founded in 1978, the product of a grant initiated at the federal level and administered by New York State through the New York State Department of State, under the leadership of Mario M. Cuomo as then-Secretary of State. Cuomo worked with Albany Law School Professors Sandra Stevenson and Bernard Harvith to secure a grant through the United States Office of Personnel Management and the United States Civil Service Commission.\n\nProfessor Sandra Stevenson served as the GLC's Director for a few months before J. Langdon Marsh became the first full-time director of the GLC on March 1, 1979 The Center contracted with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation to prepare its first state legal report in 1980, titled \"Selected Legal Problems in the Control of Hazardous Wastes.\" The Center proceeded to enter into contracts with several New York State agencies, including the New York State Department of Social Services, Adirondack Park Agency, New York State Department of State, New York State Department of Health, and with the New York State Legislature, to produce reports and offer training. Under Marsh's direction, the Center also focused on issues related to hazardous waste, zoning and planning, environmental quality review, economic development, and local government.\n\nMarsh left the Center in July 1983, and for a brief time following, Joseph W. Bellacosa served as the Center's director. He subsequently was appointed by then-New York State Governor Mario M. Cuomo to serve as a Judge on the Court of Claims and Chief Administrative Judge of all State Courts, followed by a fourteen-year term on the New York Court of Appeals.\nIn 1983, Professor Sandra M. Stevenson was re-appointed Associate Dean and Director of the Government Law Center, assuming the position she had held in the first months of the Center's existence. During her tenure, the GLC conducted training programs in alternative dispute resolution (ADR) and tying ADR to intellectual property. Under Stevenson's leadership in 1989, Albany Law School and the Government Law Center became the official repository for tapes of oral arguments heard before the New York Court of Appeals.\nIn 1990, Professor George F. Carpinello was appointed Director. Under Carpinello, the Center introduced the \"Warren M. Anderson Legislative Breakfast Seminar Series\", a series focused on topics of interest to legislators and policy makers, named for the former President Pro Tem and Majority Leader of the New York State Senate. The GLC also began producing a newsletter for the County Attorneys Association of New York State (CAASNY), prepared the first edition of \"Legal Careers in New York State Government\" (with later editions published by the New York State Bar Association), and placed student interns in the counsel's office of various state agencies.\n\nPatricia E. Salkin, Raymond and Ella Smith Distinguished Professor of Law and Associate Dean of Albany Law School, was appointed Director of the GLC in 1992, and served as the Center's Director until her appointment as dean of the Touro College Jacob D. Fuchsberg Law Center in 2012. In the first years under Salkin's leadership, the GLC began the \"Edgar and Margaret Sandman Fellowship in Aging and Health Law\", and created the Senior Citizen's Law Day, a day-long program providing local seniors with free seminars on important issues related to aging. The \"Aging Law and Policy Program\" was established in 1994 to focus on issues related to aging.\n\nIn 1994, the GLC also received funding through the United States Department of Education to create the \"Mediation Assistance Program\" to train and state-certify law and non-law students as volunteer mediators for New York's Community Dispute Settlement Program, leading to the establishment of the \"Program on Public Policy Dispute Resolution\" to focus on issues emerging in this field.\n\nIn the years that followed, a number of additional programs were initiated. \"The Lawrence F. Klepper Legal Assistance Program for Non-Profit Organizations\", helping to place law students with attorneys who provide pro bono or very low-cost services to nonprofits, was established at the GLC in 1994 by friends of the former Executive Director of the Legal Aid Society and with the support of Congregation Beth Emeth. \"The Edwin L. Crawford Memorial Lecture in Municipal Law\" was launched in 1996 to address issues of state and national importance to municipal officials. In 1998, the GLC's \"Government Law Network\" began as a way for people working in or with government to meet key law and policy makers at exclusive \"Networking Breakfast\" forums. The Center's \"Alumni Leaders in Government Networking Series\" provided students with an opportunity to interact with notable Albany Law School graduates.\n\nIn 1999, the GLC together with the Albany Law Clinic and Justice Center established the \"Semester in Government Program\", offering students full-time internships in government counsel offices in Albany and Washington, D.C. The Center also began producing \"The Government Law & Policy Journal\" for the New York State Bar Association's Committee on Attorneys in Public Service.\n\nIn 2000, the GLC started providing services for the City of Albany's newly created \"Citizen's Police Review Board\", established by a law calling upon an academic institution to support the oversight of law enforcement. \nThe GLC moved to its new location on the Albany Law School campus in 2001. The same year, the Center hosted the annual \"Saratoga Institute on Racing and Gaming Law\" as part of its \"Program on Racing and Gaming Law\". The Center also received funding from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development to expand mediation services for area housing communities.\n\nIn 2002, the GLC and Squire, Sanders and Dempsey began sponsoring the \"William B. Sanders Law and Public Policy Forum\". New York State officials such as former Governor David A. Paterson, then Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver have participated. The \"Government Lawyer in Residence\" program at the GLC was established in 2002 to give the Center and law students the resources of a former government attorney.\n\nThe GLC also produced a new edition of the \"Manual for Administrative Law Judges and Hearing Officers\" published by the New York State Department of Civil Service; a conference on the 30th anniversary of the Adirondack Park; New York's first conference on \"smart growth\"; a program to mark the 25th anniversary of the State Environmental Quality Review Act; and a symposium on siting new power plants in New York.\n\nThe GLC hosted the inaugural \"Nancy M. Sills '76 Memorial Lecture\", featuring then-Lieutenant Governor Mary O. Donohue, at the 10th Annual Senior Citizen's Law Day in 2003.

{"id": "6632138", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6632138", "title": "Grand Sanhedrin", "text": "Grand Sanhedrin\n\nThe Grand Sanhedrin was a Jewish high court convened in Europe by Napoleon I to give legal sanction to the principles expressed by the Assembly of Notables in answer to the twelve questions submitted to it by the government. The name was chosen to imply that the Grand Sanhedrin had the authority of the original Sanhedrin that had been the main legislative and judicial body of the Jewish people in classical and late antiquity.\n\nAn Assembly of Jewish notables was summoned in April 1806 by the Emperor to consider a set of 12 questions. Those who attended were largely from the Bordeaux or Rhine regions (Alsace and Lorraine). They were led by Rabbi David Sinzheim of Strasbourg, who presently became the president of the Sanhedrin.\n\nThe questions presented were:\n\n\nAt one of the meetings of the Notables, Commissioner Count Louis-Mathieu Molé expressed the satisfaction of the emperor with their answers, and announced that the emperor, requiring a pledge of strict adherence to these principles, had resolved to call together a 'great sanhedrin' which should convert the answers into decisions and make them the basis of the future status of the Jews, create a new organization, and condemn all false interpretations of their religious laws. In order that this sanhedrin, reviving the old Sanhedrin of Jerusalem, might be vested with the same sacred character as that time-honored institution, it was to be constituted on a similar pattern: it was to be composed of seventy-one members—two-thirds of them rabbis and one-third laymen. The Assembly of Notables, which was to continue its sessions, was to elect the members of the sanhedrin, and notify the several communities of Europe of its meeting, \"that they may send deputies worthy of communicating with you and able to give to the government additional information.\" The Assembly of Notables was to appoint also a committee of nine, whose duty it would be to prepare the work of the sanhedrin and devise a plan for the future organization of the Jews in France and Italy (see Consistoire).\n\nOn October 6, 1806, the Assembly of Notables issued a proclamation to all the Jewish communities of Europe, inviting them to send delegates to the sanhedrin, to convene on October 20. This proclamation, written in Hebrew, French, German, and Italian, speaks in extravagant terms of the importance of this revived institution and of the greatness of its imperial protector. While the action of Napoleon aroused in many Jews of Germany the hope that, influenced by it, their governments also would grant them the rights of citizenship, others looked upon it as a political contrivance. When in the war against Prussia (1806-7) the emperor invaded Poland and the Jews rendered great services to his army, he remarked, laughing, \"The sanhedrin is at least useful to me.\" David Friedländer and his friends in Berlin described it as a spectacle that Napoleon offered to the Parisians.\"\n\nThe opening of the sanhedrin was delayed until Feb. 9, 1807, four days after the adjournment of the Assembly of Notables. Its seventy-one members included the rabbis sitting in the Assembly, to whom were added twenty-nine other rabbis and twenty-five laymen. Its presiding officers, appointed by the minister of the interior, were: Joseph David Sinzheim, rabbi of Strasbourg (president); Joshua Benzion Segre, rabbi, and member of the municipal council of Vercelli (first vice-president); Abraham de Cologna, rabbi of Mantua (second vice-president). After a solemn religious service in the synagogue, the members assembled in the Hôtel de Ville, in a hall specially prepared for them. Following the ancient custom, they took their seats in a semicircle, according to age, on both sides of the presiding officers, the laymen behind the rabbis. They were attired in black garments, with silk capes and three-cornered hats. The sittings were public, and many visitors were present. The first meeting was opened with a Hebrew prayer written by David Sinzheim; after the address of the president and of Abraham Furtado, chairman of the Assembly of Notables, it was adjourned. At the second sitting, Feb. 12, 1807, deputies Asser, Lemon, and Litwack, of the newly constituted Amsterdam Reform congregation Adat Jeshurun, addressed the sanhedrin, Litwack in Hebrew, the others in French, expressing their entire approval of the Assembly and promising their hearty support. But the deputies were greatly disappointed when the president, after having answered them in Hebrew, invited them to be silent listeners instead of taking part in the debates as the proclamation of the Notables had caused them to expect. Addresses from congregations in France, Italy, and the Rhenish Confederation, especially from Neuwied and Dresden, were also presented.\n\nIn the sittings of Feb. 16, 19, 23, 26, and March 2, the sanhedrin voted without discussion on the replies of the Assembly of Notables, and passed them as laws. At the eighth meeting, on March 9, Hildesheimer, deputy from Frankfurt-am-Main, and Asser of Amsterdam delivered addresses, to which the president responded in Hebrew expressing great hopes for the future. After having received the thanks of the members, he closed the sanhedrin. The Notables convened again on March 25, prepared an official report, and presented it on April 6, 1807; then the imperial commissioners declared the dissolution of the Assembly of Notables.\n\nThe decisions of the sanhedrin, formulated in nine articles and drawn up in French and Hebrew, were as follows:\n\nIn the introduction to these resolutions the sanhedrin declared that, by virtue of the right conferred upon it by ancient custom and law, it constituted, like the ancient Sanhedrin, a legal assembly vested with the power of passing ordinances in order to promote the welfare of Israel and inculcate obedience to the laws of the state. These resolutions formed the basis of all subsequent laws and regulations of the French government in regard to the religious affairs of the Jews, although Napoleon, in spite of the declarations, issued a decree on March 17, 1808, restricting the Jews' legal rights. The plan of organization prepared by the committee of nine, having for its object the creation of consistories, was not submitted to the Sanhedrin, but was promulgated by Napoleon's decree of March 17, 1808.\n\n\n\n"}

He is credited with coining the term \"cubism\" in 1911 to describe the emerging art movement and the term \"surrealism\" in 1917 to describe the works of Erik Satie. The term Orphism (1912) is also his. Apollinaire wrote one of the earliest Surrealist literary works, the play \"The Breasts of Tiresias\" (1917), which became the basis for the 1947 opera \"Les mamelles de Tirésias\".\n\nApollinaire was active as a journalist and art critic for \"Le Matin\", \"L'Intransigeant\", \"L'Esprit nouveau\", \"Mercure de France\", and \"Paris Journal\". In 1912 Apollinaire cofounded \"\", an artistic and literary magazine.\n\nTwo years after being wounded in World War I, Apollinaire died in the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918; he was 38.\n\nWilhelm Albert Włodzimierz Apolinary Kostrowicki was born in Rome, Italy, and was raised speaking French, Italian, and Polish. He emigrated to France in his late teens and adopted the name Guillaume Apollinaire. His mother, born Angelika Kostrowicka, was a Polish noblewoman born near Navahrudak, Grodno Governorate (present-day Belarus). His maternal grandfather was a general in the Russian Imperial Army who was killed in the Crimean War. Apollinaire's father is unknown but may have been Francesco Costantino Camillo Flugi d'Aspermont (born 1835), a Graubünden aristocrat who disappeared early from Apollinaire's life. Francesco Flugi von Aspermont was a nephew of Conradin Flugi d'Aspermont (1787–1874), a poet who wrote in ladin putèr (an official language dialect of Switzerland spoken in Engiadina ota), and perhaps also of the Minnesänger Oswald von Wolkenstein (born c. 1377, died 2 August 1445; see \"Les ancêtres Grisons du poète Guillaume Apollinaire\" at Généanet).\n\nApollinaire eventually moved from Rome to Paris and became one of the most popular members of the artistic community of Paris (both in Montmartre and Montparnasse). His friends and collaborators in that period included Pablo Picasso, Henri Rousseau, Gertrude Stein, Max Jacob, André Salmon, André Breton, André Derain, Faik Konitza, Blaise Cendrars, Pierre Reverdy, Alexandra Exter, Jean Cocteau, Erik Satie, Ossip Zadkine, Marc Chagall, Marcel Duchamp and Jean Metzinger. He became romantically involved with Marie Laurencin, who is often identified as his muse. While there, he dabbled in anarchism and spoke out as a Dreyfusard in defense of Dreyfus's innocence.\n\nIn late 1909 or early 1910, Metzinger painted a Cubist portrait of Apollinaire. In his \"Vie anecdotique\" (16 October 1911), the poet proudly writes: \"I am honoured to be the first model of a Cubist painter, Jean Metzinger, for a portrait exhibited in 1910 at the Salon des Indépendants.\" It was not only the first Cubist portrait, according to Apollinaire, but it was also the first great portrait of the poet exhibited in public, prior to others by Louis Marcoussis, Amedeo Modigliani, Mikhail Larionov and Picasso.\nIn 1911 he joined the Puteaux Group, a branch of the Cubist movement soon to be known as the Section d'Or. The opening address of the 1912 Salon de la Section d'Or—the most important pre-World War I Cubist exhibition—was given by Apollinaire.\n\nOn 7 September 1911, police arrested and jailed him on suspicion of aiding and abetting the theft of the \"Mona Lisa\" and a number of Egyptian statuettes from the Louvre, but released him a week later. The theft of the statues was committed by a former secretary of Apollinaire, Honoré Joseph Géry Pieret, who had returned one of the stolen statues to the French newspaper the \"Paris-Journal\". Apollinaire implicated his friend Picasso, who was also brought in for questioning in the theft of the \"Mona Lisa\", but he was also exonerated. The theft of the \"Mona Lisa\" was perpetrated by Vincenzo Peruggia, an Italian house painter who acted alone and was only caught two years later when he tried to sell the painting in Florence. \n\nApollinaire wrote the preface for the first Cubist exposition outside of Paris; \"VIII Salon des Indépendants\", Brussels, 1911. In an open-handed preface to the catalogue of the Brussels Indépendants show, Apollinaire stated that these 'new painters' accepted the name of Cubists which has been given to them. He described Cubism as a new manifestation and high art [\"manifestation nouvelle et très élevée de l'art\"], not a system that constrains talent [\"non-point un système contraignant les talents\"], and the differences which characterize not only the talents but even the styles of these artists are an obvious proof of this. The artists involved with this new movement, according to Apollinaire, included Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Robert Delaunay, Fernand Léger, and Henri Le Fauconnier. By 1912 others had joined the Cubists: Jacques Villon, Marcel Duchamp, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Francis Picabia, Juan Gris, and Roger de La Fresnaye, among them.\n\nThe term Orphism was coined by Apollinaire at the Salon de la Section d'Or in 1912, referring to the works of Robert Delaunay and František Kupka. During his lecture at the Section d'Or exhibit Apollinaire presented three of Kupka's abstract works as perfect examples of \"pure painting\", as anti-figurative as music.\n\nIn \"Les Peintres Cubistes, Méditations Esthétiques\" (1913) Apollinaire described Orphism as \"the art of painting new totalities with elements that the artist does not take from visual reality, but creates entirely by himself. [...] An Orphic painter's works should convey an \"untroubled aesthetic pleasure\", but at the same time a \"meaningful structure and sublime significance\". According to Apollinaire Orphism represented a move towards a completely new art-form, much as music was to literature.\n\nThe term Surrealism was first used by Apollinaire concerning the ballet \"Parade\" in 1917. The poet Arthur Rimbaud wanted to be a visionary, to perceive the hidden side of things within the realm of another reality. In continuity with Rimbaud, Apollinaire went in search of a hidden and mysterious reality. The term \"surrealism\" appeared for the first time in March 1917 (Chronologie de Dada et du surréalisme, 1917) in a letter by Apollinaire to Paul Dermée: \"All things considered, I think in fact it is better to adopt surrealism than supernaturalism, which I first used\" [\"Tout bien examiné, je crois en effet qu'il vaut mieux adopter surréalisme que surnaturalisme que j'avais d'abord employé\"].\n\nHe described \"Parade\" as \"a kind of surrealism\" (\"une sorte de surréalisme\") when he wrote the program note the following week, thus coining the word three years before Surrealism emerged as an art movement in Paris.\n\nApollinaire fought in World War I and, in 1916, received a serious shrapnel wound to the temple, from which he would never fully recover. He wrote \"Les Mamelles de Tirésias\" while recovering from this wound. During this period he coined the word \"Surrealism\" in the programme notes for Jean Cocteau's and Erik Satie's ballet \"Parade\", first performed on 18 May 1917. He also published an artistic manifesto, \"L'Esprit nouveau et les poètes\". Apollinaire's status as a literary critic is most famous and influential in his recognition of the Marquis de Sade, whose works were for a long time obscure, yet arising in popularity as an influence upon the Dada and Surrealist art movements going on in Montparnasse at the beginning of the twentieth century as, \"The freest spirit that ever existed.\"\n\nThe war-weakened Apollinaire died of influenza during the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918. He was interred in the Père Lachaise Cemetery, Paris.\n\nIn 1900 he wrote his first novel \"Mirely, ou le petit trou pas cher\" (pornographic), which was eventually lost. Apollinaire's first collection of poetry was \"L'enchanteur pourrissant\" (1909), but \"Alcools\" (1913) established his reputation. The poems, influenced in part by the Symbolists, juxtapose the old and the new, combining traditional poetic forms with modern imagery. In 1913, Apollinaire published the essay \"Les Peintres Cubistes, Méditations Esthétiques\" on the Cubist painters, a movement which he helped to define. He also coined the term \"orphism\" to describe a tendency towards absolute abstraction in the paintings of Robert Delaunay and others.\n\nIn 1907 Apollinaire published the well-known erotic novel, \"The Eleven Thousand Rods\" (\"Les Onze Mille Verges\"). Officially banned in France until 1970, various printings of it circulated widely for many years. Apollinaire never publicly acknowledged authorship of the novel. Another erotic novel attributed to him was \"The Exploits of a Young Don Juan (Les exploits d'un jeune Don Juan)\", in which the 15-year-old hero fathers three children with various members of his entourage, including his aunt. Apollinaire's gift to Picasso of the original 1907 manuscript was one of the artist's most prized possessions. The book was made into a movie in 1987.\n\nShortly after his death, Mercure de France published \"Calligrammes\", a collection of his concrete poetry (poetry in which typography and layout adds to the overall effect), and more orthodox, though still modernist poems informed by Apollinaire's experiences in the First World War and in which he often used the technique of automatic writing.\n\nIn his youth Apollinaire lived for a short while in Belgium, mastering the Walloon dialect sufficiently to write poetry, some of which has survived.\n\n\n\n\n\nApollinaire is played by Seth Gabel in the 2018 television series \"Genius\", which focuses on the life and work of Pablo Picasso.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4655090", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4655090", "title": "Legal professional privilege", "text": "Legal professional privilege\n\nIn common law jurisdictions, legal professional privilege protects all communications between a professional legal adviser (a solicitor, barrister or attorney) and his or her clients from being disclosed without the permission of the client. The privilege is that of the client and not that of the lawyer.\n\nThe purpose behind this legal principle is to protect an individual's ability to access the justice system by encouraging complete disclosure to legal advisers without the fear that any disclosure of those communications may prejudice the client in the future.\n\nThe common law principle of legal professional privilege is of extremely long standing. The earliest recorded instance of the principle in English case-law dates from 1577 in the case of \"Berd v Lovelace the full report of which states:\n\n\"Thomas Hawtry, gentleman, was served with a subpoena to testify his knowledge touching the cause in variance; and made oath that he hath been, and yet is a solicitor in this suit, and hath received several fees of the defendant; which being informed to the Master of the Rolls, it is ordered that the said Thomas Hawtry shall not be compelled to be deposed, touching the same; and that he shall be in no danger of any contempt, touching the not executing of the same process.\"\n\nThe principle originated as protection for individuals when accessing the knowledge and legal resources available to a lawyer and was said to stem from the \"oath and honour\" of the lawyer, a sort of special contractual relationship. It was based on the fact that the ordinary citizen could not safely navigate the complexities of the law and justice system without some assistance. However, without protection the quality of the advice would suffer as clients would be discouraged from making full disclosure to their legal representatives. As Lord Brougham put it in \"Greenough v Gaskell\" (1833):\n\n\"The foundation of this rule is not difficult to discover. It is not (as has sometimes been said) on account of any particular importance which the law attributes to the business of legal professors, or any particular disposition to afford them protection ... But it is out of regard to the interests of justice, which cannot be upholden, and to the administration of justice, which cannot go on without the aid of men skilled in jurisprudence, in the practice of the courts, and in those matters affecting rights and obligations which form the subject of all judicial proceedings. If the privilege did not exist at all, every one would be thrown upon his own legal resources, deprived of professional assistance, a man would not venture to consult any skilful person, or would only dare tell his counsellor half his case\".\"\n\nIn England and Wales, the rules on legal professional privilege are set out in common law. The Civil Procedure Rules 1998 ('CPR') Rule 31.15 establishes a right to inspect documents in civil litigation, and provide that a party to whom a document has been disclosed (i.e. mentioned or relied upon in litigation) has a right to inspect that document (if such inspection would be proportionate given the nature of the case) - except where the party making disclosure has the right to withhold such inspection.\n\nOne of these rights is legal professional privilege. It is a privilege that attaches to the client (not to the lawyer) in a client–lawyer relationship. It may only, therefore, be waived by the client. In the law of England and Wales, legal professional privilege is divided into two types: advice privilege, and litigation privilege, the former category being more absolutely and broadly-defined than the latter.\n\nThe Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) and identical provisions in the Evidence Act 1995 of NSW and Tasmania now control when privilege prevents evidence is adduced during trial in any court (as defined by a proceeding bound by the laws of evidence). The rules of court in NSW extends the definitions in the Evidence Act to discovery and inspection of documents. The right, under legislation, has been renamed to reflect the fact that it is a right of the client. It is now client legal privilege (as opposed to legal professional privilege). The courts regard privilege as a \"substantive general principle which plays an important role in the effective and efficient administration of justice by the courts\", not a mere rule of evidence. As such, it extends to all forms of compulsory disclosure, including search warrants. Furthermore, although the legislature may restrict privilege \"the law [shouldn't] ease the way for the legislature to [restrict privilege]\".\n\nSolicitor–client privilege was initially a common law evidentiary principle similar to hearsay, but has since become recognized as a substantive rule that is constitutionally protected. This recognition began with \"R. v. Solosky\" (1979) where Justice Dickson, in tracing its history, regarded it as a \"fundamental civil and legal right\" that guaranteed clients a right to privacy in their communications with their lawyers even outside a courtroom.\n\nIn \"R. v. McClure\" [2001] 1 S.C.R. 445, the Court found that solicitor–client privilege was a principle of fundamental justice, hinting that it may be protected under section 7 of the \"Charter\".\n\nIn its general sense, Canada has adopted John Wigmore's definition of solicitor client privilege:\n\nJustice Lamer set out the test for solicitor–client privilege in \"Decoteaux v. Mierzwinski\":\n\nAttorney–client privilege is a legal concept that protects communications between a client and his or her attorney and keeps those communications confidential, in both civil and criminal cases. This privilege encourages open and honest communication between clients and attorneys. However, in the United States, not all state courts treat attorney communications as privileged. For instance, Washington state law, and the federal courts when applying federal law, only protect client communications—an attorney's communication will only be protected as privileged to the extent it contains or reveals the client's communications. In contrast, California state law protects the attorney's confidential communications regardless of whether they contain, refer to or reveal the client's communications. In addition, the United States Supreme Court has ruled that the privilege generally does not terminate upon the client's death. See \"Swidler & Berlin v. United States\".\n\nPrivilege cannot be relied upon where the communication is used to facilitate a crime.\n\n"}

The process of initiative and referendum became nationally known as the \"Oregon System\".\n\nThere are three types of ballot measures: initiatives, referendums, and referrals. Initiatives and referendums may be placed on the ballot if their supporters gather enough signatures from Oregon voters; the number of signatures is a percentage based on the number of voters casting ballots in the most recent election for the Governor of Oregon.\n\n\nThe constitutional foundation for ballot measures (and legislation produced by the Oregon Legislative Assembly) may be found in , and Chapter 250 of the Oregon Revised Statutes relates to initiative and referendum as well.\n\nThe Oregon Blue Book, produced by the Oregon government, maintains a list similar to this one.\n\n\nMay 17, 1988 primary election\nNovember 8, 1988 general election\nMay 16 Special Election\nJune 27 Special Election\n\nNOTE: \"Detailed information about elections from 1995 to the present, including ballot measure text, sponsorship, and arguments for and against, may be found at the Oregon Secretary of State's web site.\n\nNovember 5 General Election\n\nGeneral Election: Detailed information on Measures 14-18 and 21-27, and official election results available at the Secretary of State's web site.\n\nIn the fall election, Measure 36 (outlawing gay marriage) dominated public attention: 81,667 (or 4.7%) more votes were cast on Measure 36 than the average of all other measures on the ballot. Measure 37 (restricting land use regulation) was contentious before the election, and became more controversial after the fact, as state and local governments attempted to implement it.\n\nTwo other measures passed in 2004, both referred by the Legislature for the General Election, and neither one drawing any opposition in the Voters' Pamphlet. Measure 31 made it possible to postpone certain elections in the event of a candidate's death, and Measure 32 changed the way revenue from mobile home taxes is handled.\n\nIn 2006, voters considered 11 statewide ballot measures. All were placed on the ballot by initiative.\n\nNearly all the measures were defeated. Measures extending prescription drug pricing benefits (Measure 44) and restricting the government's power of eminent domain (39) were the only ones that passed without qualification; a campaign finance reform system (47) passed as well, but a companion measure (46) that would have provided necessary constitutional support for it failed.\n\nOut-of-state interests spent millions of dollars supporting—and in one significant case, opposing—Oregon ballot measures. None of these big-money measures passed; in fact, Measures 39 and 44 passed without drawing any organized opposition.\n\nMeasures 41 and 48 aimed to restrict the amount of money the State government could raise and spend, respectively. They were both mostly funded by the Taxpayers Association of Oregon, which in turn received nearly all its funding from Illinois-based Americans for Limited Government. Opposition to these two measures was paired as well, spending $1.9 million to defeat the two measures.\n\nMeasure 42 was promoted by conservative ballot measure activist Bill Sizemore. Sizemore broke with his custom by promoting a consumer-oriented bill, which would have outlawed the use of credit data in determining insurance premiums. Opponents of the measure spent over $3.7 million (nearly all of which came from out of state), defeating the measure. Their advertising focused heavily on Sizemore's credibility. Sizemore did not run an active campaign promoting the measure. He and his longtime political ally Loren Parks were the only people to submit arguments in favor for the Voters' Guide.\n\nMeasure 45, almost entirely financed by $1.2 million from Illinois-based U.S. Term Limits, would have established strict term limits in the Oregon Legislative Assembly. Term limits had previously been in place in the late 1990s, but the prior law was declared unconstitutional by the Oregon Supreme Court. The measure failed.\n\nMeasures 46 and 47 were presented as a single package; 46 would have amended the Constitution to allow limitations on campaign financing (heavily favoring popular vote, and requiring a 75% vote for such changes in the Legislature); and 47 detailed specific limitations. Measure 47 passed, but in the absence of the kind of Constitutional support Measure 46 would have provided, it will have no effect. The campaigns both for and against this package were funded almost entirely from Oregon sources.\n\nMeasure 40 sought to require that judges of the Oregon Supreme Court be elected by district, rather than statewide.\n\nMeasure 43 sought to require parental notification in the event of certain teenage abortions. (Two measures restricting abortion were also rejected in the 1990 general election.)\n\nMeasure 39, described by its proponents as a natural extension of 2004's Measure 37, restricted the governments powers of eminent domain. Measure 44 extended a state prescription drug benefit, previously only available to seniors, to cover all uninsured Oregonians.\n\nIn 2007, voters considered 2 statewide ballot measures.\n\nThree measures (51, 52, and 53), all legislative referrals and all constitutional amendments, were on the May 2008 primary ballot. All three passed; the first two by wide margins, and Measure 53 by a margin so narrow that it triggered an automatic recount.\n\nIn November 2008, voters considered eight initiatives and four legislative referrals. The four referrals all passed, and the initiatives all failed.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "44742223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44742223", "title": "NFL Collective Bargaining Agreement", "text": "NFL Collective Bargaining Agreement\n\nThe NFL Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) is a labor agreement which reflects the results of collective bargaining negotiations between the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA) and National Football League (NFL) team owners. The labor agreement classifies distribution of league revenues, sets health and safety standards and establishes benefits, including pensions and medical benefits, for all players in the NFL. The first collective bargaining agreement was reached in 1968 after player members of the NFLPA voted to go on strike to increase salaries, pensions and benefits for all players in the league. Later negotiations of the collective bargaining agreement called for injury grievances, a guaranteed percentage of revenues for players, an expansion of free agency and other issues impacting the business of the NFL. The NFLPA and team owners have negotiated seven different agreements since 1968.\n\nMost recently, in 2011, players and team owners reached a collective bargaining agreement after a player lockout and court-ordered mediation. The currently active agreement was ratified in 2011 and extends through the 2020 season, and includes changes to league revenue distribution, increases in player benefits and health and safety improvements including major limits on offseason, preseason and regular season practice activities.\n\nIn 1968 the National Football League Players Association was first recognized in writing by National Football League team owners. This occurred after the player members of the NFLPA voted to go on strike, intending to pressure owners to increase minimum salaries, pensions and other benefits for all players. In response, NFL team owners locked out the players who were on strike. After eleven days of work stoppage, the first collective bargaining agreement (CBA) was reached between the NFL and the NFLPA. The agreement set a minimum salary of $9,000 per year for rookie players and $10,000 per year for veteran players. It also set aside $1.5 million of league revenue to be contributed to player pensions.\n\nA new agreement was negotiated in 1970 after the NFLPA merged with the American Football League Players Association. During negotiations over the new CBA, players went on strike in July 1970.\nThe new agreement was reached after four days. The agreement increased minimum player salaries and altered the league's medical and pension programs. It also provided for impartial arbitration of injury grievances, which had previously been decided by the NFL Commissioner. John Mackey was elected as president of the NFLPA during this negotiation, and the new agreement was projected to cover the 1970 through 1973 seasons.\n\nIn 1974, the veteran NFL players went on strike for five weeks, declaring \"No Freedom, No Football,\" but they received no concessions before reporting to training camp after a two-week \"cooling off\" period. The strike never resumed, and the NFLPA player representatives voted instead to pursue a previously filed lawsuit, Mackey v. NFL, which challenged the Rozelle Rule restrictions on free agency as a violation of the federal antitrust laws. The Rozelle Rule was a compensation clause which outlined that a team losing a free agent would get equal value in return. Player confidence in the NFLPA was weakened by the strike's ineffectiveness. By 1975, fewer than half of players in the NFL were paying their union dues.\n\nAfter players won the Mackey case in court, the NFLPA and the owners settled on a new CBA which implemented a new first refusal and compensation system to replace the Rozelle Rule. The new system still placed restrictions on players' free agency. The court decision outlined that compensation for draft picks was to be awarded on the basis of the salaries received by departing free agents. The agreement reached in 1977 significantly improved some medical and pension benefits for players and gained neutral arbitration of all player/club disputes.\n\nIn 1982, after playing the first two games of the season, NFL players went on strike again, seeking to attain a guaranteed percentage of club and league revenues. This strike lasted 57 days, making it the longest work stoppage in NFL history until that date. The strike ended with a tentative agreement on November 16 which included funds to cover players' lost wages during the work stoppage. Negotiators signed a new collective bargaining agreement on December 5. The agreement improved players' benefits by implementing a new severance pay benefit, increasing minimum salaries for players in all years of service, and adding new medical rights for players. The agreement also included a revamped season schedule for 1982, which had a nine-game regular season and a new playoff format which allowed 16 of the league's 28 teams to qualify for the playoffs. Additionally, the agreement included a guarantee from the owners that players would collectively receive at least $1.6 billion in salaries and benefits over the five-year term of the new agreement.\n\nAfter playing the first two games of the season in 1987, players went on strike for free agency. In response to the strike, team owners brought in replacement players and continued the regular season after one week. Several well-known players, including Joe Montana, Lawrence Taylor and Tony Dorsett crossed the picket lines to rejoin their teams alongside these new replacements. On October 15, players voted to end the strike, to instead pursue a legal challenge to the free agency restrictions in court. In January 1988 Judge David Doty sided with the players in ruling that the clubs' continuance of the first refusal and compensation restrictions on free agents was not protected by the labor exemption to the antitrust laws. But in July 1988 Doty refused to grant an injunction which would have freed the players from the restrictions, ruling that the federal Norris-LaGuardia Act prevented courts from issuing injunctions in labor disputes. He urged both sides of the conflict to return to the bargaining table while in preparation for an anti-trust trial.\n\nIn 1989, team owners unilaterally implemented a limited free agency system called \"Plan B\". This allowed teams to continue to impose first refusal and compensation restrictions on their top 37 players. The new system also allowed players at the bottom of the roster to sign with other teams without restriction. The average salary of the players signed under Plan B increased by 40.3 percent.\n\nIn November 1989 the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that team owners were exempt from the federal antitrust laws so long as players were adequately represented by a union. That same year, the NFLPA decertified as a union, stating its union status provided more protection for the owners than for the players. The NFL continued to operate without a collective bargaining agreement until 1993.\n\nThe NFL and its players began negotiations after players won the Freeman McNeil legal case brought against Plan B. The jury decided on September 10, 1992 that Plan B was too restrictive under federal antitrust laws. Subsequently, team owners agreed to discuss free agency for all players. The NFLPA filed a class action suit in the name of Reggie White, claiming that all players in the NFL should receive money damages as a result of the illegality of Plan B. The settlement provided for payment of almost $200 million in damages, and was contingent upon the NFLPA re-forming as a union and signing a new CBA which would incorporate the terms of the litigation settlement. A seven-year CBA was signed in the spring of 1993, making it the first agreement of its kind since 1987. The new CBA provided players with unlimited free agency after playing four years in the league, subject to an exception for one franchise player per club after first year of the new CBA. In return, the NFLPA agreed to a salary cap based upon an agreed percentage of revenues. The agreement had an immediate impact on player salaries, increasing wages for the 1993 season by 38 percent.\n\nThe CBA agreed to in 1993 was extended by the agreement of players and owners in 1998. This lasted until the 2002 season, when the CBA was extended through the 2006 season.\n\nThe CBA agreed upon in 1993 was extended again in 2006 after the team owners agreed to include more revenues in the salary cap and to increase benefits, including the first ever plan to provide funds to players for medical expenses after their post-career medical insurance ran out. This extension of the CBA included an option for either party to opt out before November 8, 2008, which would have resulted in a termination of the CBA on March 1, 2011 if either side chose to exercise it. The team owners voted unanimously to opt out in May 2008.\n\nNegotiations for a new CBA began in early 2010. Team owners and new NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell demanded a cutback in salaries and benefits under the cap system, promising to lockout the players if no new agreement was reached by March 1, 2011. The NFLPA rejected Goodell’s proposal, requesting to see all league and club financial records to determine what need, if any, the clubs had for a decrease in player costs. The players voted during their 2010 team meetings to end the NFLPA’s status as a labor union as of March 1, 2011, unless a new CBA was reached by that time. Although there was no salary cap in 2010, free agency activity and overall expenditures on players declined, leading the NFLPA to file a collusion case, claiming that the owners had unlawfully agreed to reduce competition for free agents. After failing to make any progress in negotiations, both sides accepted mediation under the auspices of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) in February 2011. During mediation, players and owners agreed to extend the 2006 CBA by one week. The FMCS failed to mediate a settlement and the previous CBA expired on March 7, 2011. That same day, the NFLPA announced it was no longer a union. This allowed players to file individual antitrust cases, many of which challenged the legality of the impending lockout. Tom Brady of the New England Patriots and Peyton Manning of the Indianapolis Colts were two of the eight named plaintiffs in the action filed in Federal District Court in Minnesota.\n\nThe Federal District Court initially ruled for the players, declaring the lockout illegal because the players were no longer members of a union. The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the District Court's ruling, and the lockout continued pending a final determination in the appellate court. In July 2011, as court-ordered mediation continued between players and owners in New York, at the offices of the NFL’s lawyers, the 8th Circuit court announced that the Norris–La Guardia Act prohibited it from enjoining the lockout. The court stated in its decision that the ruling only applied to veteran players under contract, and not to unsigned rookies or veteran free agents.\n\nAfter several months of negotiations, the longest lockout in league history ended on July 25, 2011 following a tentative litigation settlement which reclassified some league revenues for cap purposes. This settlement allowed team owners to keep a small percentage from being included in future salary caps. The settlement was conditional upon the NFLPA re-constituting as a union and incorporating the settlement terms into a new CBA. Players reported to training camps in July 2011, and voted to re-constitute the NFLPA as a union. After the vote tally was confirmed on July 31, 2011, the NFLPA began six days of bargaining that resulted in a new CBA being signed on August 5, 2011.\n\nThe key features of the 2011 CBA included changes related to health and safety, including a reduction in the number of off-season practices, a prohibition against training camp “two-a days\", and a limit on contact practices in both the preseason and regular season. The new CBA also featured increases in player benefits, including retroactive pension increases for retired players and the creation of a neuro-cognitive benefit for players affected by concussions and other similar injuries. Also, the agreement promised an increase up to $1.5 million in salary guarantees for injured players and a new revenue split, offering players between 47 percent and 48.5 percent of all revenue. Changes were also made in contract-related benefits, with an increase in minimum player salaries[19] and salary cap minimums, including the guarantee of a 99% -95% league wide spend and a requirement that each club would have to spend an average of 89% of the salary cap over four-year periods.\n\nA new rookie salary system was implemented by the NFL to limit spending on first-round draft picks, but the savings were reallocated to veteran players. The 2011 CBA had no opt-out clause and a ten-year term set to expire after the 2020 season.\n"}

British Columbia had surrendered certain portions of its natural resources and Crown lands to the federal government, the Railway Belt and the Peace River Block, when it entered Confederation in 1871, as part of the agreement for the building of the transcontinental railway.\n\nFollowing protracted negotiations, in 1930 the federal government and the four provinces reached a series of agreements for the transfer of the administration of the natural resources to the provincial governments, called the Natural Resources Transfer Agreements.

{"id": "5714929", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5714929", "title": "Pacta conventa (Croatia)", "text": "Pacta conventa (Croatia)\n\nPacta conventa (Latin for \"agreed accords\") was an alleged agreement concluded between King Coloman of Hungary and the Croatian nobility in 1102 or afterwards, defining the status of Croatia in the union with Hungary. The earliest manuscript of the document is of the fourteenth century.\n\nThe document titled \"Pacta conventa\" or \"Qualiter\" (the first word in the document) was found in a Trogir library. Until the 19th century it was considered that it dated to 1102. However, most historians today hold that it is not an authentic document from 1102 and likely a forgery from the 14th century, but that the contents of the Pacta Conventa still correspond to the political situation of that time in Croatia. The document is preserved in the Hungarian National Museum in Budapest.\n\nAfter Petar Svačić, the last Croatian king of Croat descent, was killed on the battlefield in 1097, the Croats had refused to surrender. To end the war, an agreement was made, probably in 1102. The Croatian nobles allegedly concluded the \"Pacta conventa\" with King Coloman before his crowning as the Croatian king in Biograd.\n\nThe Hungarian king offered \"an agreement as pleases them\" to the twelve noble Croatian tribes from the families of Kačić, Kukar, Šubić, Snačić, Polečić, Mogorović, Gusić, Čudomirić, Karinjan and Lapčan, Lisničić, Jamometić and Tugomirić.\n\nThe agreement determined that the Croatian nobles who signed the document with King Coloman would retain their possessions and properties without interference. It also granted the mentioned families exemption from tax or tributes to the king. Each of the twelve noble Croatian tribes were obliged to answer the king's call if someone attacked his borders and send at least ten armed horsemen to war, as far as the Drava River (Croatia's northern boundary with Hungary) at their own expense. Beyond that point, the Hungarian king paid the expenses.\n\nThe document's validity is questionable. While some claim the earliest text concerning the alleged agreement came from the second half of the 14th century others call it a late medieval forgery, not a twelfth-century source. While various items of the text seem anachronistic to some, other historians say these could be reworkings of a text from an actual agreement.\n\nSince the 19th century, a number of historians have claimed that the \"Pacta conventa\" was not a genuine document.\n\nIn 1915 and then also in 1925, Milan Šufflay mentioned the document in some of his works, first declaring it an outright forgery, and later saying it was a 14th-century \"addendum\" to the manuscript of Thomas the Archdeacon. Hungarian historian János Karácsonyi thought it was a 14th-century forgery, Slovene historian Ljudmil Hauptmann dated the document to the 13th century, Croatian historians Miho Barada and Marko Kostrenčić thought it was made in 1102, while later Croatian historian Nada Klaić thought it was a forgery probably made in the 14th century. Croatian historian Stjepan Antoljak in turn said the \"Pacta\" was an incomplete historical source, but not a forgery. Nada Klaić elaborated her \"lack of opinion\" over the matter of 1102 in a 1959 article disputing the Croatian writer Oleg Mandić's earlier work on the matter.\n\nThe dispute and uncertainty over the \"Pacta conventa\" matches the overall uncertainty and dispute over the relationship between the Croatian and Hungarian kingdoms in the 10th and 11th century, with Croatian historian Ferdo Šišić and his followers assuming Tomislav of Croatia had ruled most of the area inhabited by Croats, including Slavonia, while the Hungarian historians Gyula Kristó, Bálint Hóman and János Karácsonyi thought the area between Drava and Sava belonged neither to Croatia nor to Hungary at the time, an opinion that Nada Klaić said she would not preclude, because the generic name \"Slavonia\" (lit. the land of the Slavs) may have implied so.\n\nThough the validity of the document is disputed, there was at least a non-written agreement that regulated the relations between Hungary and Croatia in approximately the same way, since from 1102 until 1918 kings of Hungary were also kings of Croatia, represented by a governor (ban), but Croatia kept its own parliament (Sabor) and considerable autonomy.\n\nThe source of inspiration for the text of the document must have been the political and social developments that had taken place over a 300-year period following 1102 when the two kingdoms united under the Hungarian king, either by the choice of the Croat nobility or by Hungarian force. The Croatian nobility retained its laws and privileges including the restriction of military service that they owed to the king within the boundaries of Croatia.\n\nAccording to the Library of Congress country study on the former Yugoslavia, King Coloman crushed opposition after the death of Ladislaus I of Hungary and won the crown of Dalmatia and Croatia in 1102. The crowning of Coloman forged a link between the Croatian and Hungarian crowns that lasted until the end of World War I. Croatians have maintained for centuries that Croatia remained a sovereign state despite the voluntary union of the two crowns. A number of Hungarian historians also accept the view that Croatia and Hungary entered in a personal union in 1102 and that, whatever the authenticity of the Pacta conventa, the contents of it correspond to the reality of rule in Croatia. However, some Hungarian and Serbian historians claim that Hungary annexed Croatia outright in 1102. According to Frederick Bernard Singleton, the Croatians have always maintained that they were never legally part of Hungary. In the eyes of Croatians, Croatia was a separate state which happened to share a ruler with the Hungarians. The degree of Croatian autonomy fluctuated from time to time, as well as its borders. According to Daniel Power, Croatia became part of Hungary in the late 11th and early twelfth century. According to the country study on Hungary Croatia was never assimilated into Hungary; rather, it became an associate kingdom administered by a ban, or civil governor. In either case, Hungarian culture permeated Croatia, the Croatian-Hungarian border shifted often, and at times Hungary treated Croatia as a vassal state.\n\nIn 1105 Coloman granted privileges to maritime cities in exchange for their submission. These included the election of their own bishops and priors which is later only confirmed by the king, prohibition of Hungarians settling in towns. Also, the cities did not pay tribute, while royal agents supervised the collection of custom duties without interfering in local politics.\n\nWhile Croatian historian Nada Klaić thinks that some sort of surrender occurred in 1102, giving the Croatians light terms, Slovenian historians Matjaž Klemenčič and Mitja Žagar believe the Pacta Conventa never actually existed, but the story about it was important to support the Croatian position later in the Habsburg Empire of rights on the basis of that agreement. Klemenčič and Žagar think that although Croatia ceased to exist as an independent state, the Croatian nobility retained relatively strong powers. Klaić thinks that the Trogir manuscript, the earliest text of the alleged pact, is not the text of that surrender, but describes contemporary relations between king and nobility and then traced that current 14th century reality back to an initial agreement.\n\nAfter the death of King Louis II at the Battle of Mohács in 1526, the Croatian parliament met at Cetin and elected Ferdinand of Austria king of Croatia. According to the Croatian historical narrative, the Croatian parliament took the opportunity in 1526 to reassert its autonomy from Hungary with the election of Ferdinand by the words:\"...we joined the Holy Crown of Hungary by our own free will just as we do now, the rule of Your Majesty\". Croatian historians also argue that the struggle for ascendancy to the Habsburg throne at this time provides evidence of Croatia's political autonomy. In the Croatian legal interpretation of the personal union, Louis II didn't leave any heirs and the legal carrier of the union (the king) didn't exist anymore so the right to elect the king belonged once more to the Croatian nobility. Unlike Hungarian historians, the Austrians never claimed they conquered Croatia by force and there appears to be little reason to doubt Croatian claims about the events of 1526.\n\nThe intro of The Hungaro-Croatian Compromise of 1868 (the Nagodba) starts as: \"Since Croatia and Slavonia have alike de jure and de facto belonged for centuries to the Crown of St. Stephen...\" Although the Nagodba provided a measure of political autonomy to Croatia-Slavonia, it was subordinated politically and economically to Budapest.\n\n"}

It has ten titles, each containing numerous sections. Title II: Enhanced Surveillance Procedures granted increased powers of surveillance to various government agencies and bodies. This title has 25 sections, with one of the sections (section 224) containing a sunset clause which sets an expiration date, December 31, 2005, for most of the title's provisions. This was extended twice: on December 22, 2005 the sunset clause expiration date was extended to February 3, 2006 and on February 2 of the same year it was again extended, this time to March 10.\n\nTitle II contains many of the most contentious provisions of the act. Supporters of the Patriot Act claim that these provisions are necessary in fighting the War on Terrorism, while its detractors argue that many of the sections of Title II infringe upon Constitutionally protected individual and civil rights.\n\nThe sections of Title II amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 and its provisions in 18 U.S.C., dealing with \"Crimes and Criminal Procedure\". It also amends the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986. In general, the Title expands federal agencies' powers in intercepting, sharing, and using private telecommunications, especially electronic communications, along with a focus on criminal investigations by updating the rules that govern computer crime investigations. It also sets out procedures and limitations for individuals who feel their rights have been violated to seek redress, including against the United States government. However, it also includes a section that deals with trade sanctions against countries whose government supports terrorism, which is not directly related to surveillance issues.\n\nTitle II covers all aspects of the surveillance of suspected terrorists, those suspected of engaging in computer fraud or abuse, and agents of a foreign power who are engaged in clandestine activities (in other words, spying). In particular, the title allows government agencies to gather \"foreign intelligence information\" from both US and non-US citizens, which is defined in of the title. changed the requirements to obtain a FISA surveillance to include that a \"\"significant purpose\"\" of the surveillance is to \"obtain foreign intelligence information\" where formerly it was required to be \"the primary purpose.\" The change in definition was meant to remove a legal \"wall\" between criminal investigations and surveillance for the purposes of gathering foreign intelligence, which hampered investigations when criminal and foreign surveillance overlapped. However, that this wall even existed was found by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review to have actually been a long-held misinterpretation by government agencies. Section 203 also gave authorities the ability to share information gathered before a federal grand jury with other agencies.\n\nThough not related to surveillance, the title also covers trade sanctions against the Taliban — a group which was determined by the Secretary of State to have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism – and the export of agricultural commodities, medicine, or medical devices is now pursuant to one-year licenses issued and reviewed by the United States Government. It also excluded export of agricultural commodities, medicine, or medical devices to the Government of Syria and to the Government of North Korea.\n\nThe title allows surveillance to intercept communications via pen register or trap and trace devices. It does not allow these surveillance measures to be used in violation of the First Amendment rights of U.S. citizens. To assist in an investigation undertaken to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities, the title allows for the seizure of communications records () and any records of session times, durations of electronic communication as well as any identifying numbers or addresses of the equipment that was being used (). Such orders may be granted \"ex parte\", and once they are granted – in order to not jeopardize the investigation – the order may not disclose the reasons behind why the order was granted. made it easier for authorities to gain access to voicemail as they no longer must apply for a wiretap order, and instead just apply for a normal search warrant.\n\nAll orders granted under section 215 must be disclosed to the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives and the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate. Every six months, the Attorney General must also provide a report to the Committees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and the Senate which details the total number of applications made for orders approving requests for the production of tangible things and the total number of such orders either granted, modified, or denied.\n\nUnder , the United States Code was amended to allow the government to have access to the records of cable customers, with the notable exclusion of access to records revealing cable subscriber selection of video programming from a cable operator.\n\n stopped a communications provider from disclosing the contents of communications with another party. However, if the provider \"reasonably\" (not defined) believes that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person is imminent, then the communications provider can now disclose this information without fear of liability. The provider may also disclose communications at the request of a government agency, if the customer allows it to be disclosed, or in cases where they must do so to protect their rights or property. Section 212 was later repealed by the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and was replaced with a new and permanent emergency disclosure provision.\n\nIn order for surveillance to be carried out, the United States Attorney General or his subordinates (so designated under ) may authorize a federal judge to grant a surveillance order to the FBI or other Federal agency. Each of the orders granted must be reviewed by one of 11 district court judges, of which at any one time three must live within 20 miles of the District of Columbia (see ).\n\nTitle II amended the U.S. Code to allow a magistrate judge to issue a warrant outside of their district for any orders that relate to terrorism (). of the title also gave a Federal court judge the power to issue nationwide service of search warrants for electronic surveillance.\n\nUnder FISA, any agency may require a common carrier, landlord, custodian, or other person provide them with all information, facilities, or technical assistance necessary to accomplish ongoing electronic surveillance. They must also protect the secrecy of and cause as little disruption to the ongoing surveillance effort as possible. This was further tightened in . further limited the sort of assistance an agency may require, and provided for compensation of any person who rendered surveillance assistance to the government agency. allows for legal immunity to any provider of a wire or electronic communication service, landlord, custodian, or other person that provides any information, facilities, or technical assistance in accordance with a court order or request for emergency assistance.\n\n allows any party who has had their rights violated due to the illegal interception of communications to take civil action against any party who undertook the illegal surveillance.\n\nSection 224 (\"Sunset\") is a sunset clause. Title II and the amendments made by the title originally would have ceased to have effect on December 31, 2005, with the exception of the below sections. However, on December 22, 2005, the sunset clause expiration date was extended to February 3, 2006, and then on February 2, 2006 it was further extended to March 10:\n\nFurther, any particular foreign intelligence investigations that are ongoing will continue to be run under the expired sections.\n\nVarious organizations have commented on Title II. Some of the most significant commentary has come from the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), the American Bar Association (ABA), the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and from the United States government.\n\nThe ABA passed resolutions that asked the U.S. government \"to conduct a thorough review of the implementation of the powers granted to the Executive Branch under the [USA PATRIOT] Act before considering legislation that would extend or further expand such powers ...\" and \"to conduct regular and timely oversight including public hearings ... to ensure that government investigations undertaken pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ... do not violate the First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments of the Constitution ...\" They also set up a website, Patriot Debates to discuss issues in relation to the USA PATRIOT Act. Various people debated specific sections of Title II in great depth on the site.\n\nKate Martin, the director of the Center for National Security Studies, argued that and 905 should be modified as she maintains the Act fails to discriminate between information gathered between terrorist and non-terrorist investigations. She believes that the Act should be modified to include some privacy safeguards: before information is gathered she believes that the court should approve the information transfer to make sure that it is necessary for ongoing activities by the agencies involved; that information shared should be limited to information relevant to investigations into terrorism; that only those people who have access to such information should actually need it to do their jobs (currently those who are not directly related to the investigation can gain access to the information); and information gathered should be marked as confidential and measures put into place to stop the inappropriate dissemination of such information. Her views were opposed by Viet Dinh, who believed that such alterations would hinder terrorism investigations.\n\nJames X. Dempsey argued that , which allows for roving surveillance under FISA, was reasonable considering that investigators already had the ability to perform roving surveillance in criminal cases. However, he says that \"as with so many provisions of the PATRIOT Act, the concern with Section 206 is not with the authority itself [but] rather, the issue is the lack of adequate checks and balances\". Dempsey believes that the section lacks two important safeguards that are present in the corresponding legislation for criminal investigations: 1) that agents actually ascertain the location of the suspect before turning on their recording devices, and 2) that \"some additional changes to FISA adopted outside of the normal process in the Intelligence Authorization Act a few months after the PATRIOT Act had the probably unintended effect of seeming to authorize \"John Doe\" roving taps – that is, FISA orders that identify \"neither\" the target nor the location of the interception.\". Dempsey also believes that the law should be changed so that those under surveillance via FISA should also be notified after surveillance has ceased, so that those wrongly targeted and placed under surveillance can challenge the government's actions. However, Paul Rosenzweig disagreed with Dempsey's premise that \"relaxation of the particularity requirement is constitutionally suspect\" and believed that it colored his argument that section 206 should be modified. Rosenzweig believes that the addition of an ascertainment requirement and the requirement that the identification of individuals should be more specific \"seem unnecessary and unwise\" — in Rosenzweig's view it would unnecessarily burden the ability of law enforcement and intelligence agents to perform surveillance on terrorist suspects.\n\nDempsey also argued that , which deals with the seizure of voicemails through the use of a normal search warrant, unnecessarily overlooked the importance of notice under the Fourth Amendment and under a Title III wiretap. He believes that there is no way to seek redress under the new provisions, as those who have an ordinary search warrant against them may never find out that their voicemail has been seized. On the now repealed and the similar current provision in the Homeland Security Act, which allows for the emergency disclosure of electronic communications under certain circumstances, he believes it leaves the law open for abuse as an agency may \"cut corners\" by informing an ISP about a potential emergency, leading to the ISP then making emergency disclosures based on this information. Dempsey suggests several modifications to implement checks and balances into the section: make after-the-act judicial review mandatory, with the suppression of evidence which is not deemed to be properly justified; the mandatory disclosure to the person whose privacy has been invaded that their information has been provided to the government; and to \"make it illegal for a government official to intentionally or recklessly mislead a service provider as to the existence of an emergency\". Dempsey also believes that , which allows for the nationwide service of search warrants for electronic evidence, made it \"more difficult for a distant service provider to appear before the issuing court and object to legal or procedural defects\". A solution suggested by Dempsey to this problem would be to allow a warrant to be challenged in the district it was served as well as in the district it was issued.\n\nOrin S. Kerr also agreed with James Dempsey that the sections were uncontroversial, but argued they should be kept. Kerr believes that \"for the most part, Jim Dempsey's proposals for reform would impose greater privacy restrictions for online investigations than equivalent offline investigations\". He believes that Dempsey's proposal to require after-the-act judicial review for exigent circumstances has no parallel in the Fourth Amendment; that allowing recipients of orders to challenge orders within the recipients own district would not follow \"the traditional rule that any challenge (itself an extremely rare event) must be filed in the issuing district\"; and that disclosure to the person whose electronic voicemail has been seized also has no such parallel in the Fourth Amendment, as while notice must be given to a home owner whose house is being searched this is not done to allow a challenge to the order but rather shows them that due legal process is being followed and that the search is not being conducted by a rogue agent – Kerr believes that \"current law appears to satisfy this policy concern by providing notice to the ISP\".\n\nHeather Mac Donald argued that , which provides for the so-called \"sneak and peek\" provisions of the Patriot Act, is necessary because the temporary delay in notification of a search order stops terrorists from tipping off their counterparts that they are being investigated. She claims that the section allows the government to conduct secret searches without notification from such organizations as the ACLU and the Century Foundation are wrong, and listed several arguments that she believed are easily discredited. She called them: \"Conceal Legal Precedent\", \"Hide the Judge\", \"Amend the Statute\", and \"Reject Secrecy\". James X. Dempsey countered that section 213 was a \"perfect example of a good idea gone too far\" and argued that secrecy was already dealt when FISA was amended in 1994 to allow the government to carry out secret searches. Dempsey objects to the fact that section 213 as enacted is not limited to terrorism cases. Dempsey believes that the section confuses the law and was hastily cobbled together – his primary example is the reference to the definition of \"adverse result\", which he argues was unrelated with regards to the Patriot Act's purposes. He believes the definition is too broad and \"offer little guidance to judges and will bring about no national uniformity in sneak and peek cases.\" He also believes that \"reasonable period\" is too vague and that it leaves judges with no uniform standard, and may leave courts outside the Ninth and Second Circuit the ability to make up their own rules. He also wonders why if sneak and peak orders are a \"time-honored tool\" used by courts for decades, then why it was necessary for the Justice Department to push to make section 213 applicable in all cases that such a measure is used. The answer Dempsey posits is that they were on shaky constitutional ground and that they were \"trying to bolster it with Congressional action – even action by a Congress that thought it was voting on an anti-terrorism bill, not a general crimes bill.\" Dempsey's reasons for believing that they were on shaky ground was because although the 1986 \"United States v. Freitas\", 800 F.2d 1451 (9th Cir.), and 1990, United States v. Villegas, 899 F.2d 1324 (2d Cir.) circuit opinions were premised on the assumption that notice was not an element of the Fourth Amendment, \"Wilson v. Arkansas\", 514 U.S. 927 (1995) Justice Thomas of the Supreme Court found that notice is part of the Fourth Amendment. In order to fix what he believes to be serious flaws in section 213, Dempsey proposes several changes be made to the section: the requirement for reasonable cause to be found by a judge be changed to be probable cause; that the section should not apply to every case of delayed notification and that Congress should require that any delay in notification not extend for more than seven days without additional judicial authorization.\n\nAndrew C. McCarthy believed that sections (deals with Pen Register and Trap and Trace Authority under FISA) and (expanded what records could be accessed under FISA) should be retained. He argues that the Federal Rules of Criminal Prodecure, Rule 17(c), authorizes the compulsory production of \"any books, papers, documents, data, or other objects\" to criminal investigators by mere subpoena, and so section 215 merely brought FISA into line with current criminal law. He also states that the records included in section 215 are records held by third parties, and therefore are exempt from a citizen's reasonable expectations of privacy. In light of this, McCarthy believes that there are three main reasons why the access to library records is not a problem: firstly he believes that the government has always had the authority to compel the reading of records by subpoena and there has been \"no empirical indication of systematic prying into private choices – else we'd surely have heard from the robustly organized librarians\"; secondly he believes that in the current information age that there is just too much information for inappropriate access to such records; and thirdly he believes that an \"a priori\" ban on the investigative access to the reading of records would be both unprecedented and wrong. He points out that \"literature evidence was a staple of terrorism prosecutions throughout the 1990s\" and that the reading of records has already led to convictions of terrorists.\n\nThough the government must only specify that the records concerned are sought for an authorized investigation instead of providing \"specific and articulable facts\" to perform surveillance on an agent of a foreign power, he points out that it prohibits investigations that violate first amendment rights of citizens, which he says is not specified in the corresponding criminal procedures. He says that the FISC is not meant to apply searching judicial review of surveillance orders as the role of the judiciary is to make sure the executive branch is not abusing its powers and \"by requiring the FBI to make solemn representations to the court, and mandating that the Attorney General report semi-annually on this provision's implementation, Section 215 provides suitable metrics for oversight and, if necessary, reform\". However, McCarthy does believe that section 215 \"should be amended to clarify that order recipients may move the FISA court to quash or narrow production\", however he says that the US DOJ has already decided that this is implicit in the section so it is probably unnecessary. He believes that further amendment is unnecessary and unwise.\n\nOn section 214, McCarthy believes that the pre-Patriot Act version of FISA, which required government agencies to \"certify that the monitored communications would likely be those either of an international terrorist or spy involved in a violation of U.S. criminal law, or of an agent of a foreign power involved in terrorism or espionage\" was \"an unnecessary and imprudently high hurdle\" as pen registers and wiretaps do not violate the Fourth Amendment. Therefore, he argues, \"there is no constitutional reason to require investigators to seek court authorization for them at all\". Thus McCarthy says, the amendments to FISA made by section 214 are \"both modest and eminently reasonable\".\n\nPeter P. Swire was much more skeptical about section 214 and 215 than McCarthy. He explains that FISA originally did not apply to business records and was only designed for surveillance, and after the Oklahoma and World Trade Center bombing it was amended to apply to travel documents only. It was section 215 that made broad changes to allow access to business records. He also explains that the legal standing changed in such a way that a FISA order to access business records to could apply to anyone, and if necessary the government could ask for access to whole databases. He argues that \"FISA orders can now apply to anyone, not only the target of the investigation\" and that it is no longer necessary for FISA orders to be targeted against a foreign power or agents of a foreign power, but can now be used to gain records of those who have nothing to do with a foreign power. He says that there are only weak constraints to base the order on an authorized investigation and that surveillance must not be based entirely on First Amendment activities.\n\nSwire pointed out that business records obtained under FISA are different from those obtained under similar criminal legislation, in that gag orders may not be applied to criminal investigations. He also argues that the US DOJ's assertion that they can gain access to documents held by a third party because these documents are not protected by the Fourth Amendment is flawed because \"it mistakenly asserts that something that is constitutional is also desirable policy\". He points out that \"to see this mistake, consider that a 90 percent income tax is almost certainly constitutional, but few people think it therefore would be a wise policy\" . In this light he argues that a better policy for sensitive library documents is to have significant oversight from the courts.\n\nAndrew C. McCarthy argued that section 218, which changed FISA from stating that the \"purpose\" of foreign surveillance was to gather intelligence information to be the \"significant purpose\" of intelligence information gathering, should be kept even though it is already clear that this is what is meant under FISA in any case. He explains that FISA was misinterpreted to have \"primary purpose\" tests for surveillance for nearly a quarter-century, and that in April 2002 the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review found that,\nSimilarly, McCarthy argues that the separation of foreign intelligence and criminal investigation is a false dichotomy, in that \"the existence of a crime or national security threat is an objective reality, entirely independent of the investigators' subjective mindsets about why they are investigating\". He believes that it is wrong \"to suspect systematically dishonest resort to FISA [, as] FISA applications require a specialized and rigorous internal approval process before presentation to the court. Assuming arguendo an agent willing to act corruptly, it would be far easier and less detectable to fabricate the evidence necessary to get an ordinary criminal wiretap than to fabricate a national security reason to use FISA\". McCarthy believes that over time, the U.S. Justice Department misinterpreted FISA to believe that criminal investigations could not be undertaken under FISA, but \"began construing the certification not as a mere \"announcement of purpose\" but as something more restrictive: a \"substantive limitation\" on the use of FISA evidence in criminal cases\". McCarthy then explains that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review found that \"\"clearly did not preclude or limit the government's use ... of foreign intelligence information, which included evidence of certain kinds of criminal activity, in a criminal prosecution.\" McCarthy then notes the practical consequences of the U.S. DoJ's misinterpretation of FISA:\nIn light of these matters, McCarthy believes that although section 218 is not legally necessary it should remain anyway, to clarify clearly what the Act says and remove any misunderstanding as to what is meant in FISA, and he believes that the section should not sunset.\n\nDavid D. Cole argued that the changes to the law were unnecessary, and accused the proponents of the USA PATRIOT Act of \"[being] equally guilty of propagating competing myths in this debate, nowhere more so than with respect to Section 218 and the \"wall.\" He agrees that the wall was not required by FISA, and maintains that section 218 was not sufficient to reduce barriers between information sharing amongst agencies – this, he says, was and remains a bureaucratic issue and not a statutory one. He blames the CIA not trusting the FBI, and believes that pre-Patriot Act FISA was not the cause of problems of communications between the two agencies. Cole's argument is that the primary purpose test applied to acquiring foreign intelligence information when undertaking surveillance was \"simply sought to reduce the risk that FISA, which permits searches on less than criminal probable cause, would become an end run around the constitutional requirement of criminal probable cause for searches conducted for criminal law purposes\" and that although a secondary criminal purpose may later arise, the agency firstly must primarily gain the order to gain foreign intelligence information. He also dismissed the claims that before section 218 was enacted possible terrorist prosecution was not possible, citing the prosecution of Sami Al-Arian by the U.S. DOJ, which used FISA wiretaps undertaken before the Patriot Act was enacted, which fell under the pre-Patriot FISA law. He also attacks suggestions that when an investigation turned from foreign intelligence to a primarily criminal investigation then a wiretap would need to be taken down, instead positing that once it became criminal \"government agents would simply have to satisfy the standards applicable to criminal investigations – namely, by showing that they had probable cause that the tap would reveal evidence of criminal conduct... [and t]he tap or the search would then continue\".\n\nCole believes that the FISA is based on an untested (by the U.S. Supreme Court) assumption that FISA searches can be performed under a lower showing of suspicion than would be mandated for criminal searches. He believes that the term \"foreign power\" is broad enough to \"[encompass] any political organization a majority of non-citizens\", and though they must show reasonable evidence of a crime when targeting a U.S. citizen, the agency must only show evidence that a foreign person is an agent of a foreign power. He states that FISA was based on an \"administrative search\" exception to the Fourth Amendment, which relaxed the probable cause requirement for searches \"where the search serves some special need beyond criminal law enforcement\". However, Cole believes that the administrative search exception does not apply to criminal law enforcement, therefore when an investigation turns into a primarily criminal investigation the traditional standards of criminal probable cause would then apply. The crux of Cole's argument is that,\nCole believes that section 218 makes it more likely \"that information obtained through FISA wiretaps and searches will be used against defendants in criminal cases\", and suggests that criminal defendants or their cleared counsel should be able to review \"the initial application for the FISA wiretap or search when contesting the admissibility of evidence obtained through a FISA search\" using \"[a]n amendment requiring disclosure of FISA applications where evidence is sought to be used in a criminal trial would encourage adherence to the law by putting federal officials on notice that at some point the legality of the FISA warrant would be subjected to adversarial testing\". Confidentiality could be kept by limiting access to the information to cleared council or by applying the restrictions of the Classified Information Procedures Act.\n\nMcCarthy totally disagreed with everything Cole said, stating that \"It is apt that Professor David Cole begins the title of his response 'Imaginary Walls[.]' His submission is largely imaginary, creating rather than relating 'myths' about the structural impediments to good intelligence that plagued the pre-9/11 world.\" He believes that Cole's whole argument is pinned to the belief that FISA in unconstitutional, something McCarthy totally disagreed with. In McCarthy's mind, Cole's objection to FISA is that he believes, incorrectly, that under the Fourth Amendment searches are \"inappropriate absent probable cause of a crime\". He argues that Cole is wrong when he states that FISA requires a lower standard of suspicion to authorize searches, but rather it requires a different standard than is required of criminal searches. McCarthy says Cole's \"suggestion that a 'foreign power' under FISA could be any 'political organization' predominantly of non-citizens is overwrought\", and that only those organizations proven to be engaged in clandestine operations will be targeted. He also says that Cole is wrong in that under FISA government searches and surveillance were never restricted to searches whose primary purpose was intelligence gathering, and therefore section 218 is not constitutionally suspect. McCarthy says that though the enforcing of a wall between criminal and foreign investigations under FISA was a misunderstanding by the U.S. DOJ, the reality was that the misunderstanding of the Act did not mean that structural restrictions were not established. He ends by stating that \"[n]o one claims the wall tainted the propriety of intelligence gathering. It blocked sharing of the intelligence gathered. That is the bureaucratic monstrosity dismantled by Section 218... Without that clarification of law, the disastrous primary purpose doctrine would be undisturbed, the unnecessary wall would still be in place, dots would remain unconnected, prosecutions like al-Arian would not have occurred, and the United States would be at considerably greater risk.\"\n\nIn his final response, Cole defended himself, stating that his argument about the constitutionality of section 218 was because it \"deprives FISA of its constitutional justification\" — previously, he says, FISA searches were justified without reasonable cause justifications because they fell under an \"administrative search\" exception in the constitution. However, Cole says that the Supreme Court has held that this \"does not apply where the government's purpose is criminal law enforcement\". Now that the Patriot Act makes foreign intelligence gathering the significant and not sole reason for FISA searches, allowing for criminal searches under FISA, Cole believes that such searches would then by on constitutionally shaky ground. Cole argues that McCarthy's argument is based on a false premise: that section 218 is constitutional because, in McCarthy's words, \"[it] mandat[es] that intelligence gathering be \"a primary purpose,\" [and] constrains the government in a way that neither the Fourth Amendment nor FISA does\". Cole disputes this, and says that \"the very purpose of Section 218 was to eliminate the 'primary purpose' requirement\". Cole also believes that McCarthy is wrong when he asserts that FISA targets only those \"foreign powers\" engaged in intelligence gathering, sabotage or international terrorism (McCarthy cited ). Cole cites , where FISA defines a \"foreign power\" as \"a foreign-based political organization, not substantially composed of United States persons.\" and defines an \"agent\" of a foreign power to be those who are \"an officer or employee of a foreign power.\" This, he says, is too broad, giving the example where a \"British citizen working here as an employee of Amnesty International is an 'agent of a foreign power.'\". Cole finally points out that McCarthy does not address his suggestion that \"[FISA] should be amended to permit defendants in those prosecutions access to the FISA applications to challenge the warrant's validity\".\n\nEPIC has criticized numerous sections of the title. The main thrust of their argument is that the Act does not provide a system of checks and balances to safeguard civil liberties in the face of significantly increase powers of surveillance and investigative powers for law enforcement agencies in the United States. They criticize:\n\n\nEPIC also singled out Section 205, which allows the director of the FBI to employ translators, and , which increases the number of Federal judges that can review surveillance orders from seven to eleven as \"commendable in their efforts to aid the government in preventing terrorist acts while maintaining a system checking intrusion onto citizens' civil liberties\".\n\nThe ACLU, an advocate of both free speech and also personal privacy has objected strongly to the Patriot Act, claiming it is flawed and violates a number of personal freedoms. \"There are significant flaws in the Patriot Act, flaws that threaten your fundamental freedoms by giving the government the power to access to your medical records, tax records, information about the books you buy or borrow without probable cause, and the power to break into your home and conduct secret searches without telling you for weeks, months, or indefinitely.\"\n\nThough the ACLU does not largely name specific sections, generally speaking they:\n\n\nThe EFF has been scathing in its criticism of the Patriot Act. They have stated that \"while containing some sections that seem appropriate—providing for victims of the September 11 attacks, increasing translation facilities and increasing forensic cybercrime capabilities—it seems clear that the vast majority of the sections included were not carefully studied by Congress, nor was sufficient time taken to debate it or to hear testimony from experts outside of law enforcement in the fields where it makes major changes\" and that \"[many provisions] are aimed at nonviolent, domestic crime... [and] although many of the provisions facially appear aimed at terrorism, the Government made no showing that the reasons they failed to detect the planning of the recent attacks or any other terrorist attacks were the civil liberties compromised with the passage of PATRIOT.\" They have also criticized the addition of computer crimes to the list of acts deemed to be terrorist related.\n\nThe EFF have criticized:\n\n\nThe American Library Association strongly objects to section 215. In a resolution passed on June 29, 2005 they stated that \"Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act allows the government to secretly request and obtain library records for large numbers of individuals without any reason to believe they are involved in illegal activity\". They resolved:\n\n\nTheir stance did not go without criticism. One prominent critic of the ALA's stance was the Manhattan Institute's Heather Mac Donald, who stated in an article for the \"City Journal\" that \"[t]he furor over section 215 is a case study in Patriot Act fear-mongering.\"\n\nIn response to its many critics, and in response to the many criticisms of the Patriot Act, the U.S. government set up a website, lifeandliberty.gov, devoted to responding to criticism. This website no longer exists; however, when it did, they devoted a page to what they believed to be myths perpetuated by the ACLU and stated that \"Congress simply took existing legal principles and retrofitted them to preserve the lives and liberty of the American people from the challenges posed by a global terrorist network.\" They defended:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "33152780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33152780", "title": "Potter v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd", "text": "Potter v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd\n\nPotter v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd, was a significant Australian court case, decided in the High Court of Australia on 20 March 1906. The case was an influential decision in Australian Private International Law which is generally regarded as based on an extension of the Moçambique rule to actions for infringement of patents.\n\nCharles Potter was an analytical chemist who lived in Melbourne, Victoria who in 1901 obtained patents in New South Wales and Victoria for a froth flotation process using sulphuric acid to separate silver, lead and zinc ores from waste. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company, now BHP, was incorporated in Victoria and operated a silver, lead and zinc mine Broken Hill. Guillaume Delprat, the General Manager of BHP, claimed to have discovered a similar process, and this was used at BHP's mine. Potter commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court of Victoria. BHP denied the novelty and utility of the patented process, but also that that an action for the infringement in New South Wales of a New South Wales patent was not justiciable in Victoria. The question of law whether the claim was justiciable in Victoria was referred to the Full Court. Potter was represented by Higgins while BHP was represented by Isaacs . A majority of the Supreme Court held that the Victorian Courts had no jurisdiction to deal with the suit as the cause of action was local to New South Wales. Potter appealed to the High Court.\n\nIn a key statement affirming the application of the Moçambique rule, Griffith CJ stated:\nIt is settled law that an English Court cannot entertain a suit in which the question of title to foreign land is directly in controversy: \"British South Africa Co v Companhia de Moçambique\". The Courts will no doubt entertain such a question of title if it arises merely incidentally in a case in which the foundation of the jurisdiction is a personal obligation arising from contract or quasi-contractual relationship between the parties.\n\nHe further went on to say:\nIn my opinion the same rule must be applied to foreign patents that is applied to foreign lands. The reasons upon which the rule in the one case are founded are, I think, equally applicable to the other.\n\n'As already mentioned, the decision is generally regarded as based on the Moçambique rule. Although the Moçambique rule is one of the elements in the conclusion of the High Court, an examination of the way in which the case was argued, and of the reasoning of the High Court, shows that it is a decision extending the act of state doctrine to foreign patents.'\n\nIn 2002 a majority of the High Court indicated that it would like to reconsider this authority, with Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ stating \"We also would reserve for further consideration in an appropriate case the Moçambique rule, and the standing of \"Potter v Broken Hill Propriety Co Ltd\".\"\n\nThe matter arose again in the High Court in 2011 where French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ noted that \"Potter v Broken Hill Propriety Co Ltd\" was argued on a basis which, though conceded, can now be seen to be false, namely, 'that, for the purposes of the question ... under consideration, the several States of Australia stand towards each other in the position of foreign States'. No consideration appears to have been given in argument or in the judgments to relevant constitutional questions including, but not limited to, the application of the full faith and credit provisions of s 118 of the Constitution.\n\n'It received no attention in the English case-law until it was mentioned by Lord Wilberforce in \"Hesperides Hotels Ltd v Aegean Turkish Holidays Ltd\" [1979] AC 508, 536 as authority for the proposition that the \"Moçambique\" rule applied in Australia. It was only from the 1980s that it came to be regarded as a significant authority in the field of transnational intellectual property litigation: \"Def Lepp Music v Stuart-Brown\" [1986] 273; \"Tyburn Productions Ltd v Conan Doyle\" [1991] Ch 75 (both copyright cases).'\n\nThe 2011 United Kingdom Supreme Court decision of \"Lucasfilm Limited v Ainsworth\", significantly eroded much of the underpinning of this case and of the \"Moçambique\" rule, at least within the UK.\n\nThis case was decided at a time when patents were granted by the several States in Australia, and was subject to the common law rule that each Australian State and Territory is treated as a 'distinct and separate country or law area'.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19361387", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19361387", "title": "Prussian estates", "text": "Prussian estates\n\nThe Prussian estates (, ) were representative bodies of Prussia, first created by the Monastic state of Teutonic Prussia in the 14th century (around the 1370s) but later becoming a devolved legislature for Royal Prussia within the Kingdom of Poland. They were at first composed of officials of six big cities of the region; Braunsberg (Braniewo), Culm (Chełmno), Elbing (Elbląg), Danzig (Gdańsk), Königsberg (Królewiec) and Thorn (Toruń). Later, representatives of other towns as well as nobility were also included. The estates met on average four times per year, and discussed issues such as commerce and foreign relations.\n\nOriginally, the Teutonic Order created the Estate to appease the local citizens, but over time the relations between the Order and the Estates grew strained, as the Order of knights treated the local population with contempt.\n\nDifferent Prussian holders of the privilege of coinage (among them the Order and some cities), actually committed to issue a Prussian currency of standardised quality, had debased the coins and expanded their circulation in order to finance the wars between Poland and Teutonic Prussia. However, this expansion disturbed the equilibrium of coins circulated to the volume of contractual obligations, only coming down to a harsh depreciation of all existing nominally fixed contractual obligations by inflating all other non-fixed prices measured by these coins, ending only once the purchasing power of every extra issued coin equalled its material and production costs.\n\n\"Obligations would be retroactively changed if new coins, too plentifully issued, would be counted as equal to the old ones (1526, lines 307-310).\" Thus a law was \"passed by the Diet of Teutonic Prussia in 1418 (cf. Max Toeppen, 1878, 320seqq.), smartly regulating the fulfilment of old debts fixed in old currency by adding an agio when repaid by new coins.\" Thus creditors and recipients of nominally fixed revenues were not to lose by debasement-induced inflation.\n\nAs Prussia became increasingly tied economically and politically with Poland, and the wars became more and more devastating to the borderlands, and as the policies and attitude of the King of Poland were more liberal towards the Prussian burghers and nobility than that of the Order, the rift between the Teutonic Knights and their subjects widened.\n\nThe Estates drifted towards the Kingdom of Poland in their political alignment. Norman Housley noted that \"The alienation of the Prussian Estates represented a massive political failure on the part of the Order\".\n\nAt first, the estates opposed the Order passively, by denying requests for additional taxes and support in Order wars with Poland; by the 1440s Prussian estates acted openly in defiance of the Teutonic Order, rebelling against the knights and siding with Poland militarily (see Lizard Union, Prussian Confederation and the Thirteen Years' War).\n\nThe estates eventually became governed by the Kingdom of Poland. First the western part of Prussia, which became known as Royal Prussia after the Second Peace of Thorn ended the Thirteen Years' War in 1466, and later the eastern lands, known as Ducal Prussia, after the Prussian Homage in 1525, became part of the kingdom. On 10 December 1525 at their session in Königsberg the Prussian estates established the Lutheran Church in Ducal Prussia by deciding the Church Order.\n\nNicolaus Copernicus, then canon of the Prince-Bishopric of Warmia, addressed the Prussian estates with three memoranda, in fact little essays, on currency reform. Debasements continued to ruin Prussian finances, the groat had been debased by 1/5 to 1/6 of its prior bullion content. In 1517, 1519 and again in 1526 he suggested to return to the law passed in 1418. However, especially the cities refused that. They had raised most of the funds for the warfares, and now lightened their debt burden by debasing their coins, thus passing on part of the burden to receivers of nominally fixed revenues, such as civic and ecclesiastical creditors and civic, feudal and ecclesiastical collectors of nominally fixed monetarised dues. So Copernicus' effort failed. At least the estates refused to peg the Prussian currency to the Polish (as proposed by Ludwig Dietz), which even suffered a worse debasement than the Prussian.\n\nUnder Polish sovereignty, Prussians, particularly those from Royal Prussia, saw their liberties confirmed and expanded; local cities prospered economically (Gdańsk become the largest and richest city in the Commonwealth), and local nobility participated in the benefits of Golden Liberty, such as the right to elect the king. Royal Prussia, as a direct part of the Kingdom of Poland (and later Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth) had more influence on Polish politics and more privileges than Ducal Prussia, which remained a fief (for example, while nobles from the Royal Prussia had their own sejmiks, Sejm and Senate representatives, those from the Duchy did not. Royal Prussia also had its own parliament, the Prussian \"Landesrat\", although it was partially incorporated into the Commonwealth Sejm after the Union of Lublin, it retained distinct features of Royal Prussia.\n\nWith the power of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth waning from the mid-17th century onwards, the Prussian Estates drifted under the influence of the Hohenzollern Electors of Brandenburg, who ruled Ducal Prussia in personal union with Brandenburg from 1618 (first the eastern Duchy of Prussia, sovereign after the Treaty of Wehlau in 1657 and upgraded to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701; then the western Royal Prussia, annexed to the former after the First Partition of Poland in 1772). Under the Hohenzollerns' absolutist rule the power of the Estates increasingly diminished.\n\nMembers of the Estates, then by status mostly noble landed manor holders, and the circle of potential debtors were literally the same. In order to overcome the restrictions on selling manor estates to fulfil outstanding debts, the manor estate holders formed a corporation of mutually liable debtors. So solvent manor estate holders had to step in for over-indebted borrowers, thus transforming the manor estate holders into a corporation of collective liability. Covering over-indebted borrowers imposed hardship for the solvent manor-estate holders. This affected many opinions and even aroused appeals to abolish the feudal system of manor estate holding, while others demanded the re-establishment of pure feudalism without borrowing at all.\n\nIn the Napoleonic era (ca 1799-1815) the East Prussian Estates gained some political influence again. King Frederick William III of Prussia needed to raise funds in order to pay the enormous French war contributions of thaler 140 million imposed after Prussia's defeat of 1806, and making up about an annual pre-war budget of the government. In 1807 the East Prussian Estates made a political bargain on accepting the king as a member within their credit corporation with his royal East Prussian demesnes, to be encumbered as security for the Pfandbriefe to be issued in his favour, which he was to sell to investors, thus raising credit funds.\n\nIn return the Estates reached a wider representation of further parts of the population. The reformed body included two new groups:\n\n\nWith representation in the estates the newly represented groups were also entitled to eventually raise credits, obliged to liability for credits of others, but simultaneously gained a say in the Estates assembly.\n\nOn 9 October 1807 the reforming Prussian minister Heinrich vom und zum Stein prompted Frederick William III to decree the October Edict (Edict concerning the relieved possession and the free usage of real estate [landed property] as well as the personal relations of the rural population) which generally transformed all kind of landholdings into free allodial property. This act enormously increased the amount of alienable real estate in Prussia apt to be pledged as security for credits, needed so much to pay the higher taxes in order to finance Napoléon's warfare through the compulsory war contributions to France. Serfdom was thus also abolished. Most remaining legal differences between the estates (classes) were abolished in 1810, when almost all Prussian subjects – former feudal lords, serfs, burghers (city dwellers), free peasants, Huguenots etc., turned into citizens of Prussia. The last excepted group - the Jews - became citizens in 1812.\n\nWhen in 1813 the defeated and intimidated King Frederick William III, forced into a coalition with France from 1812, refrained to take his chance to shake off the French supremacy in the wake of Napoleon's defeats in Russia, the East Prussian estates stole a march on the king. On 23 January Count Friedrich Ferdinand Alexander zu Dohna-Schlobitten, president of the Estates assembly, called its members for 5 February 1813.\n\nAfter debating the appeal of Ludwig Yorck, illoyal and – therefore by Berlin – outlawed general of the Prussian auxiliary corps within Napoléon's army, to form a liberation army, which was widely agreed, on February 7 the East Prussian estates unanimously voted for financing, recruiting and equipping a militia army (Landwehr) of 20,000 men, plus 10,000 in reserve, out of their funds - following a proposal designed by Yorck, Clausewitz and Stein. The hesitant king could not stop this anymore, but only approve it (17 March 1813).\n\nHowever, this civic act of initiating Prussia's participation in the liberation wars did not meet with the gratitude of the monarch, who again and again procrastinated over his promise to introduce a parliament of genuine legislative competence for all the monarchy. Only in the wake of the Revolutions of 1848 did Prussia receive its first constitution providing for the Prussian Landtag as the parliament of the kingdom. It consisted of two chambers, the Herrenhaus (Prussian House of Lords) and the Abgeordnetenhaus (House of Representatives).\n\nIn 1899, the Prussian Landtag moved into a new building consisting of a complex of two structures, one for the House of Lords ( used by the Bundesrat) in Leipziger Straße and one for the House of Representatives in Prinz-Albrecht-Straße, today's Niederkirchnerstraße.\n\nThe House of Lords was reorganised and renamed into the Staatsrat (state council) of the Free State of Prussia after the abolition of the monarchy in 1918. Its members were representatives of the Provinces of Prussia. Konrad Adenauer served as its president from 1921 to 1933.\n\nSince 1993 the former House of Representatives building has served as the seat of the Abgeordnetenhaus von Berlin (House of Representatives of Berlin), and similar to the Reichstag, among Berliners it is still sometimes referred to colloquially as \"Preußischer Landtag\".\n\n\n"}

In March 1923 between 80 and 100 suspected Irish nationalists in Britain were arrested by the police and sent to the Irish Free State under the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act 1920 (ROIA). One of the detainees, Art O'Brien, challenged his detention in a test case at the Divisional Court. The case eventually went to both the Court of Appeal and House of Lords, who decided that the internments were illegal because the Irish Free State was an independent nation and so British Acts of Parliament no longer applied to it.\n\nThe decision effectively illegalised the ROIA and led to the immediate release of O'Brien and the other detained individuals, who sued the British Government for false imprisonment. The government pushed through the Restoration of Order in Ireland (Indemnity) Act 1923, which limited the money they had to pay the detainees, who eventually received £43,000. O'Brien himself was re-arrested and found guilty of sedition, and was imprisoned until 1924.\n\nFollowing the Irish War of Independence the Irish Free State was set up as an independent British Dominion covering most of the island of Ireland. After a brief civil war between the pro-Free State forces and members of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) who wanted any independent nation to cover the entire island the status of the Irish Free State was confirmed, and the IRA forced underground. The IRA had supporters in the United Kingdom, working openly as the Irish Self-Determination League (ISDL), and the Free State government shared the names of these supporters with the British authorities, who kept a close eye on them. Between February and March they provided information on individuals that they said were part of widespread plots against the Irish Free State being prepared on British soil. On 11 March 1923 the police in Britain arrested IRA sympathisers living in Britain including Art O'Brien, the head of the ISDL. Sources disagree on numbers, giving either approximately eighty or approximately 100. The arrested men were placed on special trains and sent to Liverpool, where they were transferred to Dublin via a Royal Navy destroyer. It later transpired that not only were many British citizens (Art O'Brien himself had been born in England), at least six had never even been to Ireland before.\n\nThe next day the arrests were publicly queried in the House of Commons, and a Labour backbencher Jack Jones started a debate on the subject in the afternoon. W.C. Bridgeman, the Home Secretary, said that he had directly ordered the police to arrest the ISDL members under the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act 1920, and that he had consulted the Attorney General who considered it legal.\n\nA few days after the arrests the solicitors for one of the deported men, Art O'Brien, got in contact with Sir Patrick Hastings KC, a Member of Parliament for the Labour Party and a noted barrister. On 23 March 1923 Hastings represented O'Brien in front of a Divisional Court consisting of Mr Justice Avory and Mr Justice Salter to apply for a writ of \"habeas corpus\" for O'Brien as a test case to allow the release of the others. The initial hearing did not go anywhere because Hastings was unable to provide an affidavit from O'Brien (who was in Mountjoy Prison), which was required for a writ of \"habeas corpus\" to be considered, but by the time the hearing was resumed on 10 April he had managed to obtain one. Hastings argued that because the Irish Free State was an independent nation the British laws governing it, such as the 1920 act, were effectively repealed. In addition the Home Secretary had no power to order an individual to be detained overseas because he had no control over what happened to them there.\n\nThe court eventually declared that they could not issue a writ, because the Habeas Corpus Act 1862 prevented them from issuing a writ to any colony possessing a court which could also issue a writ. Since Ireland possessed such a court, the English Divisional Court could not act. Hastings attempted to argue that the writ could be issued against the Home Secretary but this also failed, since the Home Secretary did not actually possess O'Brien.\n\nThe decision was then appealed to the Court of Appeal and argued on 23 and 24 April. The Court of Appeal reversed the Divisional Court's decision. The court decided that the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act 1920 had been implicitly repealed when the Irish Free State, an independent nation, came into existence. In addition it was not proper for the Home Secretary to order the detention and deportation of someone overseas, since they had no control over what happened to them. It was completely appropriate to issue a writ of \"habeas corpus\" against the Home Secretary because, even though he did not physically have O'Brien, he was considered responsible for him. The Home Secretary was accordingly ordered to produce O'Brien before the court on 16 May.\n\nHe appealed to the House of Lords, who decided (led by Lord Birkenhead) that they did not have the jurisdiction to hear the appeal, since a rule of English law specifies that once a writ of \"habeas corpus\" is issued (as it was by the Court of Appeal) no superior court can overrule it. After a further attempt to keep O'Brien in custody (simply by not letting him out of prison) he was finally released on 16 May.\n\nO'Brien immediately sued the British Government for false imprisonment, and to avoid any liability the government prepared the Restoration of Order in Ireland (Indemnity) Act 1923 which would indemnify them against any claims for damages by the imprisoned sympathisers. The Labour Party whittled it down when it was being prepared so that it would only limit compensation rather than remove it entirely. A tribunal was set up under Lord Atkin to assess damages, and the sympathisers as a whole were eventually paid £43,000. Art O'Brien himself was arrested soon after release and convicted of sedition. He was released in 1924.\n\n"}

Evidence that is beyond reasonable doubt is the standard of evidence required to validate a criminal conviction in most adversarial legal systems.\n\nGenerally, prosecutors bear the burden of proof and are required to prove their version of events to this standard. This means that the proposition being presented by the prosecution must be proven to the extent that there could be no \"reasonable doubt\" in the mind of a \"reasonable person\" that the defendant is guilty. There can still be a doubt, but only to the extent that it would \"not\" affect a reasonable person's belief regarding whether or not the defendant is guilty. Beyond \"the shadow of a doubt\" is sometimes used interchangeably with beyond reasonable doubt, but this extends beyond the latter, to the extent that it may be considered an impossible standard. The term \"reasonable doubt\" is therefore used.\n\nIf doubt \"does\" affect a \"reasonable person's\" belief that the defendant is guilty, the jury is not satisfied beyond \"reasonable doubt\". The precise meaning of words such as \"reasonable\" and \"doubt\" are usually defined within jurisprudence of the applicable country. A related idea is Blackstone's formulation \"It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer\".\n\nBeyond a reasonable doubt is the highest burden of proof in any court in the United States. Criminal cases must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nIn English common law prior to the \"reasonable doubt\" standard, passing judgment in criminal trials had severe religious repercussions for jurors. According to judicial law prior to the 1780s: \"the Juryman who finds any other person guilty, is liable to the Vengeance of God upon his Family and Trade, Body and Soul, in this world and that to come.\" It was also believed \"In every case of doubt, where one's salvation is in peril, one must always take the safer way...A judge who is in doubt must refuse to judge.\" It was in reaction to these \"religious fears\" that \"reasonable doubt\" was introduced in the late 18th century to English common law, thereby allowing jurors to more easily convict. Therefore, the original use of the \"reasonable doubt\" standard was opposite to its modern use of limiting a juror's ability to convict.\n\nHowever, juries in criminal courts in England are no longer customarily directed to consider whether there is \"reasonable doubt\" about a defendant's guilt. Indeed, a 2008 conviction was appealed after the judge had said to the jury \"You must be satisfied of guilt beyond all reasonable doubt.\" The conviction was upheld but the Appeal Court made clear their unhappiness with the judge's remark, indicating that the judge should instead have said to the jury simply that before they can return a verdict of guilty, they \"must be sure that the defendant is guilty\".\n\nThe principle of 'beyond reasonable doubt' was expounded in \"Woolmington v DPP [1935] UKHL 1\":\n\nJuries are always told that, if conviction there is to be, the prosecution must prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. This statement cannot mean that in order to be acquitted the prisoner must \"satisfy\" the jury. This is the law as laid down in the Court of Criminal Appeal in Rex v. Davies 29 Times LR 350; 8 Cr App R 211, the headnote of which correctly states that where intent is an ingredient of a crime there is no onus on the defendant to prove that the act alleged was accidental. Throughout the web of the English Criminal Law one golden thread is always to be seen, that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the prisoner's guilt subject to what I have already said as to the defence of insanity and subject also to any statutory exception. If, at the end of and on the whole of the case, there is a reasonable doubt, created by the evidence given by either the prosecution or the prisoner, as to whether the prisoner killed the deceased with a malicious intention, the prosecution has not made out the case and the prisoner is entitled to an acquittal. No matter what the charge or where the trial, the principle that the prosecution must prove the guilt of the prisoner is part of the common law of England and no attempt to whittle it down can be entertained.\n\nIn Canada, the expression \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" requires clarification for the benefit of the jury. The leading decision is \"R. v. Lifchus\", where the Supreme Court discussed the proper elements of a charge to the jury on the concept of \"reasonable doubt\" and noted that \"[t]he correct explanation of the requisite burden of proof is essential to ensure a fair criminal trial.\" While the Court did not prescribe any specific wording that a trial judge must use to explain the concept, it recommended certain elements that should be included in a jury charge, as well as pointing out comments that should be avoided.\n\nThe Supreme Court suggested that the concept of proof beyond a reasonable doubt should be explained to juries as follows:\n\nThe Court also warned trial judges that they should avoid explaining the concept in the following ways: \n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada has since emphasized in \"R. v. Starr\" that an effective way to explain the concept is to tell the jury that proof beyond a reasonable doubt \"falls much closer to absolute certainty than to proof on a balance of probabilities.\" It is not enough to believe that the accused is probably guilty, or likely guilty. Proof of probable guilt, or likely guilt, is not proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nIn New Zealand, jurors are typically told throughout a trial that the offence must be proved \"beyond reasonable doubt\", and judges usually include this in the summing-up. There is no absolute prescription as to how judges should explain reasonable doubt to juries. Judges usually tell jurors that they will be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt if they \"feel sure\" or \"are sure\" that the defendant is guilty. In line with appellate court direction, judges do little to elaborate on this or to explain what it means.\n\nResearch published in 1999 found that many jurors were uncertain what \"beyond reasonable doubt\" meant. \"They generally thought in terms of percentages, and debated and disagreed with each other about the percentage certainty required for 'beyond reasonable doubt', variously interpreting it as 100 per cent, 95 per cent, 75 per cent and even 50 per cent. Occasionally this produced profound misunderstandings about the standard of proof.\"\n\nIn \"R v Wanhalla\", President Young of the Court of Appeal set out a model jury direction on the standard of proof required for a criminal conviction.\n\nIn the United States, juries must be instructed to apply the reasonable doubt standard when determining the guilt or innocence of a criminal defendant, but there is much disagreement as to whether the jury should be given a definition of \"reasonable doubt.\" In \"Victor v. Nebraska\" (1994), the U.S. Supreme Court expressed disapproval of the unclear reasonable doubt instructions at issue, but stopped short of setting forth an exemplary jury instruction.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court first discusses the term in \"Miles v. United States\" (1880): \"The evidence upon which a jury is justified in returning a verdict of guilty must be sufficient to produce a conviction of guilt, to the exclusion of all reasonable doubt.\" \"In re Winship\" (1970) establishes that the doctrine also applies to juvenile criminal proceedings, and indeed to all the essential facts necessary to prove the crime: \"[W]e explicitly hold that the Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.\"\n\nSince 1945, Japan has also operated by a \"reasonable doubt\" standard, including the doctrine of \"in dubio pro reo\", which was instituted by the Supreme Court during a controversial murder trial in 1975 (the Shiratori case brought before the Supreme Court of Japan, see for example notes on Shigemitsu Dandō). However, this is not considered an essential standard in Japan and lower level judges sometimes disregard it.\n"}

{"id": "753844", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=753844", "title": "Tawana Brawley rape allegations", "text": "Tawana Brawley rape allegations\n\nTawana Glenda Brawley or Tawana Vicenia Brawley (born December 15, 1971 or b. 1972) is an African-American woman from Wappingers Falls, New York, who gained notoriety in 1987–88 for falsely accusing four white men of having raped her. The charges received widespread national attention because of her age (15), the persons accused (including police officers and a prosecuting attorney), and the state in which Brawley was found after the alleged rape. Brawley was found in a trash bag, with racial slurs written on her body and covered in feces on November 28, 1987. Brawley's advisers Al Sharpton, Alton H. Maddox and C. Vernon Mason also helped the case to gain prominence.\n\nAfter hearing evidence, a grand jury concluded in October 1988 that Brawley had not been the victim of a forcible sexual assault and that she herself may have created the appearance of such an attack. The New York prosecutor whom Brawley had accused as one of her alleged assailants successfully sued Brawley and her three advisers for defamation. Brawley initially received considerable support from the African-American community. Some suggested that Brawley was victimized by biased reporting that adhered to racial stereotypes. The mainstream media's coverage drew heated criticism from the African-American press and many black leaders who believed the teenager and her story. The grand jury's conclusions decreased support for Brawley and her advisers. Brawley's family has maintained that the allegations were true.\n\nOn November 28, 1987, Tawana Brawley, who had been missing for four days from her home in Wappingers Falls, New York, was found seemingly unconscious and unresponsive, lying in a garbage bag several feet from an apartment where she had once lived. Her clothing was torn and burned, her body smeared with feces. She was taken to the emergency room, where the words \"KKK\", \"nigger\", and \"bitch\" were discovered written on her torso with charcoal.\n\nA detective from the Sheriff's Juvenile Aid Bureau, among others, was summoned to interview Brawley, but she remained unresponsive. The family requested a black officer, which the police department was able to provide. Brawley, described as having an \"extremely spacey\" look on her face, communicated with this officer with nods of the head, shrugs of the shoulder, and written notes. The interview lasted 20 minutes, during which she uttered only one word: \"neon\". Through gestures and writing, however, she indicated she had been raped repeatedly in a wooded area by six white men, at least one of whom, she said, was a police officer. A sexual assault kit was administered, and police began building a case. Brawley provided no names or descriptions of her assailants. She later told others that there had been no rape, only other kinds of sexual abuse. Forensic tests found no evidence that a sexual assault of any kind had occurred. There was no evidence of exposure to elements, which would have been expected in a victim held for several days in the woods at a time when the temperature dropped below freezing at night.\n\nPublic response to Brawley's story was at first mostly sympathetic. Bill Cosby offered a $25,000 reward for information on the case, while Don King pledged $100,000 toward Brawley's education. In December 1987, over one thousand people, including Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, marched through the streets of Newburgh, New York, in support of Brawley.\n\nBrawley's claims in the case captured headlines across the country. Public rallies were held denouncing the incident. When civil rights activist Al Sharpton, with attorneys Alton H. Maddox and C. Vernon Mason, began handling Brawley's publicity, the case quickly became highly controversial. Sharpton, Maddox, and Mason generated a national media sensation. The three said that officials all the way up to the state government were trying to cover up defendants in the case because they were white. They further asserted that the Ku Klux Klan, the Irish Republican Army and the Mafia were collaborating with the U.S. government in the alleged cover up. Harry Crist Jr., a police officer who committed suicide shortly after the period when Brawley was allegedly held captive, became a suspect in the case. Steven Pagones, an Assistant District Attorney in Dutchess County, New York, attempted to establish an alibi for Crist, stating that he had been with Crist during that period of time. Sharpton, Maddox, and Mason then said that Crist and Pagones were two of the rapists. They also accused Pagones of being a racist. \"The New York Times\" reported, based on his suicide note, that Crist killed himself because his girlfriend ended their relationship shortly before his death, and because he was upset that he was unable to become a state trooper.\n\nThe mainstream media's coverage drew heated criticism from the African-American press and leaders for its treatment of the teenager. They cited the leaking and publication of photos taken of her at the hospital and the revelation of her name despite her being underage. In addition, critics were concerned that Brawley had been left in the custody of her mother, stepfather and advisers, rather than being given protection by the state. In an opinion piece in \"The New York Times\", Martha Miles and Richard L. Madden wrote\nState law provides that if a child appears to have been sexually molested, then the Child Protective Services Agency is supposed to take jurisdiction and custody of that child. Now, Tawana Brawley was 15 at the time of the incident. If that had been done... early on, the agency would have given her psychiatric attention and preserved evidence of rape...\n\nSharpton's former aide Perry McKinnon said that Sharpton, Maddox, and Mason were unconcerned with Brawley and were using the case to \"tak[e] over the town,\" as he had heard Sharpton say that the case could make him and Brawley's other two advisers \"the biggest niggers in New York\". In June 1988, at the height of the controversy surrounding the case, a poll showed a gap of 34 percentage points between blacks (51%) and whites (85%) on the question of whether Brawley was lying.\n\nUnder the authority of New York State Attorney General Robert Abrams, a grand jury was called to hear evidence. On October 6, 1988, the grand jury released its 170-page report concluding Brawley had not been abducted, assaulted, raped and sodomized, as Brawley and her advisers said. The report further concluded that the \"unsworn public allegations against Dutchess County Assistant District Attorney Steven Pagones\" were false and had no basis in fact. Before issuing the report, the grand jury heard from 180 witnesses, saw 250 exhibits and recorded more than 6,000 pages of testimony.\n\nIn the decision, the grand jury noted many problems with Brawley's story. Among these were that the rape kit results did not indicate sexual assault. Additionally, despite saying she been held captive outdoors for days, Brawley was not suffering from hypothermia, was well-nourished, and appeared to have brushed her teeth recently. Despite her clothing being charred, there were no burns on her body. Although a shoe she was wearing was cut through, Brawley had no injuries to her foot. The racial epithets written on her were upside down, which led to suspicion that Brawley had written the words. Testimony from her schoolmates indicated she had attended a local party during the time of her supposed abduction. One witness claimed to have observed Brawley's climbing into the garbage bag. The feces on her body were identified as coming from her neighbor's dog. Brawley never testified despite a subpoena ordering her to do so.\n\nOn June 6, 1988, Tawana's mother Glenda Brawley was sentenced to 30 days in prison and fined $250 for contempt of court for refusing to testify at the grand jury hearing. She evaded arrest by hiding in churches, with the police failing to arrest her, arguing it would lead to violence. The Brawley family then fled New York state, travelling around the country for several months before settling in Virginia Beach.\n\nMuch of the grand jury evidence pointed to a possible motive for Brawley's falsifying the incident: trying to avoid violent punishment from her mother and her stepfather, Ralph King. Witnesses testified that Glenda Brawley had previously beaten her daughter for running away and for spending nights with boys. King had a history of violence that included stabbing his first wife 14 times, later shooting and killing her. There was considerable evidence that King could and would violently attack Brawley: when Brawley had been arrested on a shoplifting charge the previous May, King attempted to beat her for the offense while at the police station. Witnesses also described King as having talked about his stepdaughter in a sexualizing manner. On the day of her alleged disappearance, Brawley had skipped school to visit her boyfriend, Todd Buxton, who was serving a six-month jail sentence. When Buxton's mother (with whom she had visited Buxton in jail) urged her to get home before she got in trouble, Brawley told her, \"I'm already in trouble.\" She described how angry King was over a previous incident of her staying out late.\n\nThere was evidence that Brawley's mother and King participated knowingly in the hoax. Neighbors told the grand jury that in February they overheard Glenda Brawley saying to King, \"You shouldn't have took the money because after it all comes out, they're going to find out the truth.\" Another neighbor heard Mrs. Brawley say, \"They know we're lying and they're going to find out and come and get us.\"\n\nIn April 1989, \"New York Newsday\" published claims by a boyfriend of Brawley's, Daryl Rodriguez, that she had told him the story was fabricated, with help from her mother, in order to avert the wrath of her stepfather. Writing about the case in a 2004 book on perceptions of racial violence, sociologist Jonathan Markovitz concluded \"it is reasonable to suggest that Brawley's fear and the kinds of suffering that she must have gone through must have been truly staggering if they were enough to force her to resort to cutting her hair, covering herself in feces and crawling into a garbage bag.\"\n\nThe case highlighted mistrust of legal institutions within the black community. Legal scholar Patricia J. Williams wrote in 1991 that the teenager \"has been the victim of some unspeakable crime. No matter how she got there. No matter who did it to her—and even if she did it to herself.\" These comments aroused controversy as well; Sue Sherry responded to Williams in her book \"Beyond All Reason: The Radical Assault on Truth in American Law\", writing \"The radical multiculturalists seem unable or unwilling to differentiate between Brawley's fantasized rape and another woman's real one. Indifference to the distinction between fact and fiction minimizes real suffering by implying that it is no worse than imagined or self-inflicted suffering.\" On May 21, 1990, Alton H. Maddox was indefinitely suspended by the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court in Brooklyn after failing to appear before a disciplinary hearing to answer allegations regarding his conduct in the Brawley case.\n\nIn 1998, Pagones was awarded $345,000 through a lawsuit for defamation of character that he had brought against Sharpton, Maddox and Mason; Pagones initially sought $395 million. The jury found Sharpton liable for making seven defamatory statements about Pagones, Maddox for two and Mason for one. The jury deadlocked on four of the 22 statements over which Pagones had sued, and it found eight statements to be non-defamatory. In a later interview, Pagones said the turmoil caused by the accusations of Brawley and her advisers had cost him his first marriage and much personal grief.\n\nPagones also sued Brawley. She defaulted by not appearing at the trial, and the judge ordered her to pay Pagones damages of $185,000. The $65,000 judgment levied against Al Sharpton was paid for him in 2001 by supporters, including attorney Johnnie Cochran and businessman Earl G. Graves, Jr. In December 2012, the \"New York Post\" reported that Maddox had paid his judgment of $97,000 and Mason was making payments on the $188,000 which he owed. Brawley reportedly had not made any payments. The following month a court ordered her wages garnished to pay Pagones.\n\nIn a 1997 appearance, Brawley maintained she did not invent the story; she still had supporters. In November 2007, Brawley's stepfather and mother, in a 20th-anniversary feature for the \"New York Daily News\", contended the attack happened. \"How could we make this up and take down the state of New York? We're just regular people,\" Glenda Brawley said.\" They said they had asked New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and Governor Andrew Cuomo to reopen the case. They also said that Brawley would speak at any legal proceedings. As of 2013, Brawley lives in Virginia, under a new name.\n\n\n\n"}

The treaty provided for the organisation of military, economic, social and cultural cooperation among member states, as well as a mutual defence clause.\n\nThe treaty was signed on 17 March 1948 by Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom - the members of the Western Union - as an expansion to the Treaty of Dunkirk, signed between Britain and France the previous year to guard against possible German or Soviet aggression after the end of World War II.\n\nThe need to back up the commitments of the North Atlantic Treaty with appropriate political and military structures led to the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). In December 1950 the parties to the Treaty of Brussels decided to transfer the headquarters, personnel, and plans of the Western Union Military Organisation (WUDO) to NATO, whose Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) took over responsibility for the defence of Western Europe.\n\nThe establishment of NATO, along with the signing of a succession of treaties establishing the Organisation for European Economic Cooperation (April 1948), the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (April 1949), the Council of Europe (May 1949) and the European Coal and Steel Community (April 1951), left the Treaty of Brussels and its Western Union devoid of authority.\n\nThe treaty was amended at the 1954 Paris Conference as a result of the failure of the Treaty establishing the European Defence Community to gain French ratification: The General Treaty () of 1952 formally named the EDC as a prerequisite of the end of Allied occupation of Germany, and there was a desire to include Germany in the Western defence architecture. The Modified Brussels Treaty (MBT) transformed the Western Union into the Western European Union (WEU), at which point Italy and Germany were admitted. Although the WEU established by the Modified Brussels Treaty was significantly less powerful and ambitious than the original Western Union, German membership of the WEU was considered sufficient for the occupation of the country to end in accordance with the General Treaty.\n\nWhen the European Union (EU) gained its own mutual defence clause upon the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009, the members of the WEU - who were also EU member states \n- regarded the WEU as redundant. Consequently the Modified Treaty of Brussels was terminated on 31 March 2010, followed by the closure of WEU bodies on 30 June 2011.\n\nThe treaty provided for the organisation of military, economic, social and cultural cooperation among member states.\n\nThe Treaty of Brussels contained a mutual defence clause (Article IV in the original treaty and Article V in the Modified Brussels Treaty).\n\n\nThe treaty was intended to provide Western Europe with a bulwark against the communist threat and to bring greater collective security. There were cultural and social clauses and concepts for the setting up of a 'Consultative Council'. Co-operation between Western nations was believed to help stop the spread of Communism.\n\nThe Treaty was signed on 17 March 1948 by the following plenipotentiaries:\n\nDates of deposit of the instruments of ratification of the treaty:\n\nIn September 1948, the parties to the Treaty of Brussels decided to create a military agency under the name of the Western Union Defence Organization. It consisted of a WU Defence Committee at Prime Ministerial level, and a WU Combined Chiefs of Staff committee, including all the national chiefs of staff, which would direct the operative organisation.\n\nField Marshal Bernard Montgomery (UK) was appointed permanent Chairman of the Land, Naval and Air Commanders-in-Committee, with headquarters in Fontainebleau, France. The nominated commanders-in-chief were General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny (France) as C-in-C, Land Forces, Air Chief Marshal Sir James Robb (UK) as C-in-C, Air Forces, and Vice-Admiral Robert Jaujard (France) for the Navy, as Flag Officer Western Europe. Volume 3 of Nigel Hamilton's \"Life of Montgomery of Alamein\" gives a good account of the disagreements between Montgomery and de Lattre which caused much ill-feeling in the headquarters.\n\nThe treaty was left devoid of much of its authority after the signing of a succession of treaties establishing the Organisation for European Economic Cooperation (April 1948), the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (April 1949), the Council of Europe (May 1949) and the European Coal and Steel Community (April 1951).\n\nWhen the division of Europe into two opposing camps became considered unavoidable, the threat of the USSR became much more important than the threat of German rearmament. Western Europe, therefore, sought a new mutual defence pact involving the United States, a powerful military force for such an alliance. The United States, concerned with containing the influence of the USSR, was responsive. The need to back up the commitments of the North Atlantic Treaty with appropriate political and military structures led to the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). In December 1950, with the appointment of General Eisenhower as the first Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), the members of the Treaty of Brussels decided to merge the Western Union Military Organisation (WUDO) into NATO. NATO's Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) took over the WUDO's defence role.\n\nAs an effort towards European postwar security co-operation, the treaty was a precursor to NATO in that it promised European mutual defence. However, it greatly differed from NATO in that it envisaged a purely-European mutual defence pact primarily against Germany. When NATO took shape the next year, on the other hand, it was recognised that Europe was being unavoidably divided into two opposing blocks (western and communist), and the USSR was a much greater threat than the possibility of a resurgent Germany, and Western European mutual defence would have to be Atlanticist and so include North America.\n\nTrying to avoid the need for West German rearmament, a treaty aimed at establishing a European Defence Community was signed by the six ECSC members in May 1952 but failed when it was rejected by the French National Assembly in August 1954. This rejection led to the London and Paris Conferences in September and October, with the result that the Treaty of Brussels was amended by the Protocol signed in Paris on 23 October 1954, which added West Germany and Italy to the Western Union Defence Organization (WUDO). At this time, the WUDO was renamed the Western European Union, and the Treaty was renamed the Modified Brussels Treaty.\n\nOn 23 October 1954, as a result of the rejection of the Treaty establishing the European Defence Community by the French parliament and the following London and Paris Conferences, the Treaty of Brussels was amended as the Modified Brussels Treaty. This transformed the Western Union into the Western European Union and admitted West Germany and Italy. Social and cultural aspects were handed to the Council of Europe to avoid duplication of responsibilities within Europe.\n\nIn 2009, Article 42.7 of the Treaty of Lisbon effectively replaced Article V of the Modified Brussels Treaty as the mutual defence clause for EU member states who were also WEU allies. After discussions, the ten WEU member states decided to terminate the Treaty of Brussels on 31 March 2010. The activities of WEU were formally terminated in June 2011.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "9089011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9089011", "title": "Turkish nationality law", "text": "Turkish nationality law\n\nTurkish nationality law is based primarily on the principle of jus sanguinis. Children who are born to a Turkish mother or a Turkish father (in or out of marriage) are Turkish citizens from birth.\nThe intention to renounce Turkish citizenship (or acquire citizenship from another state) is submitted in Turkey by a petition to the highest administrative official in the concerned person's place of residence, and when overseas to the Turkish consulate. Documents processed by these authorities are forwarded to the Ministry of Interior for appropriate action.\n\nCitizenship is defined in Article 66 of the Turkish constitution:\nA child adopted by a Turkish citizen automatically becomes a Turkish citizen if under 18 years old on the date the application for adoption was made. In some cases (although it is not required), those who have foreign names and are applying for Turkish citizenship change their name to a Turkish (but not necessarily a Muslim) name. Examples of people who have done this include football players Colin Kazim-Richards and Mehmet Aurélio.\n\nNaturalization and loss of Turkish citizenship is controlled by the Vital Statistics Office (), a department of the Ministry of the Interior.\n\nFormer Turkish citizens who were forced to give up their Turkish citizenship (for example, because they have naturalized in a country that usually does not permit dual citizenship, such as Germany or Austria) can apply for the Blue Card (\"Mavi Kart\"), which gives them some citizens' rights back, e.g. the right to live and work in Turkey, the right to possess land or the right to inherit. Excluded from this \"Citizenship light\" is the right to vote.\n\nA foreign national may apply for nationalization if the following conditions are met:\nMeeting these conditions does not give a foreign national an absolute right to Turkish citizenship.\n\nA foreign national who has been married to a Turkish citizen for three years and is still married to that partner may apply for naturalization under a different set of conditions:\nFollowing a successful application, the naturalised spouse may retain their Turkish citizenship if the marriage should subsequently be dissolved, so long as both partners had entered into the marriage in good faith.\n\nSince 12 January 2017, Law No 5901 disposes that foreign citizens investing in Turkey will be granted the right to apply for Turkish citizenship.\n\nA foreign national who make one of the following investments or fulfils one of the condition may apply for Turkish citizenship:\nThe investment made and claimed by the foreign national will be monitored and confirmed by the relevant Government authority. Once the investment is confirmed by the relevant governmental authority, the foreign national will be granted Turkish citizenship.\n\nDual citizenship is possible in Turkish law.\n\nThe laws of Turkey provide for acquisition of Turkish citizenship based on one's descent—by birth to a Turkish citizen parent (or parents) in Turkey and also by birth abroad to a Turkish citizen parent (or parents)—regardless of the other nationalities a person might acquire at birth. Children born in Turkey to foreign citizens do not have a claim to Turkish citizenship, unless one of the parents is also a Turkish citizen or the child would otherwise be stateless. The automatic acquisition (or retention) of a foreign nationality does not affect Turkish citizenship. Turkish laws have no provisions requiring citizens who are born with dual nationality to choose one nationality over the other when they become adults.\n\nWhile recognizing the existence of dual nationality and permitting Turkish citizens to have other nationalities, the Turkish government requires that those who apply for another nationality inform the relevant Turkish authority (the nearest Turkish embassy or consulate abroad) and provide the original naturalisation certificate, Turkish birth certificate, document attesting to completion of military service (for males), marriage certificate (if applicable) and four photographs. Dual nationals are not required to use a Turkish passport to enter and leave Turkey; it is permitted to travel with a valid foreign passport (or national ID card for some nationals) and the Turkish National ID card.\n\nSince not all countries allow dual citizenship, Turks must sometimes give up their Turkish citizenship in order to naturalise as citizens of another country. \n\nHolders of an ordinary Turkish passport may travel without a visa, or with a visa received upon arrival, to 105 countries, as of 1 January 2017 according to the Visa Restrictions Index.\n\nTurkey also provides a special sort of \"passport for foreigners\" to citizens of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), to enable them to travel freely, as this country is generally not recognized and the TRNC passports are not accepted as valid travel documents in some countries.\n\nCitizens of TRNC are also entitled to become citizens of Turkey if they wish and apply to do so. They are exempt from the above criterea. The only criterea is that they are born Turkish Cypriots, i.e. of a Turkish Cypriot mother or father.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "438952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=438952", "title": "Tzedakah", "text": "Tzedakah\n\nTzedakah or Ṣ'daqah in Classical Hebrew (), is a Hebrew word literally meaning \"justice\" or \"righteousness\", but commonly used to signify \"charity\" Notably, this concept of \"charity\" is different from the modern Western understanding of \"charity\", which is typically understood as a spontaneous act of goodwill and a marker of generosity, as \"tzedakah\" is rather an ethical obligation. In Judaism, \"tzedakah\" refers to the religious obligation to do what is right and just, which Judaism emphasizes is an important part of living a spiritual life. Thus, unlike voluntary philanthropy, \"tzedakah\" is seen as a religious obligation that must be performed regardless of one's financial standing, and is considered mandatory even for those of limited financial means. More broadly, \"tzedakah\" is considered to be one of the three main acts that can positively influence an unfavorable heavenly decree.\n\nThe word \"tzedakah\" is based on the Hebrew (צדק, \"Tzedek\") meaning \"righteousness\", \"fairness\" or \"justice\", and is related to the Hebrew word \"Tzadik\", meaning \"righteous\" as an adjective (or \"righteous individual\" as a noun in the form of a substantive). Although the word appears 157 times in the Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Bible, typically in relation to \"righteousness\" \"per se\", its use as a term for \"charity\" in the above sense is an adaptation of Rabbinic Judaism in Talmudic times.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, Maimonides conceived of an eight-level hierarchy of \"tzedakah\", where the highest form is to give a gift, loan, or partnership that will result in the recipient becoming self-sufficient, instead of living upon others; in his view, the second highest form of \"tzedakah\" is to give donations anonymously to unknown recipients.\n\nThe Hebrew Bible teaches the obligation to aid those in need, but does not employ one single term for this obligation. The term \"tzedekah\" occurs 157 times in the Masoretic Text, typically in relation to \"righteousness\" per se, usually in the singular, but sometimes in the plural \"tzedekot\", in relation to acts of charity. In the Septuagint this was sometimes translated as \"eleemosyne\", \"almsgiving.\"\n\nIn classical rabbinical literature, it was argued that the Biblical regulations concerning left-overs only applied to corn fields, orchards, and vineyards, and not to vegetable gardens; the classical rabbinical writers were much stricter in regard to who could receive the remains. It was stated that the farmer was not permitted to benefit from the gleanings, and was not permitted to discriminate among the poor, nor try to frighten them away with dogs or lions (Hullin 131a, Pe'ah 5:6) the farmer was not even allowed to help one of the poor to gather the left-overs. However, it was also argued that the law was only applicable in Canaan, (Jerusalem Talmud. Pe'ah 2:5) although many classical rabbinical writers who were based in Babylon observed the laws there (Hullin 134b) it was also seen as only applying to Jewish paupers, but poor non-Jews were allowed to benefit for the sake of civil peace.\n\nMaimonides lists his Eight Levels of Giving, as written in the \"Mishneh Torah\", \"Hilkhot matanot aniyim\" (\"Laws about Giving to Poor People\"), Chapter 10:7–14:\n\n\nIn practice, most Jews carry out \"tzedakah\" by donating a portion of their income to charitable institutions, or to needy people that they may encounter; the perception among many modern-day Jews is that if donation of this form is not possible, the obligation of \"tzedakah\" still requires that something be given. Traditional Jews commonly practice \"ma'sar kesafim,\" tithing 10% of their income to support those in need.\n\nSpecial acts of \"tzedakah\" are performed on significant days; at weddings, Jewish brides and bridegrooms would traditionally give to charity, to symbolise the sacred character of the marriage; at Passover, a major holiday in Jewish tradition, it is traditional to be welcoming towards hungry strangers, and feed them at the table; at Purim it is considered obligatory for every Jew to give food to one other person, and gifts to at least two poor people, in an amount that would equate to a meal each, for the purpose of increasing the total happiness during the month.\n\nAs for the more limited form of \"tzedakah\" expressed in the biblical laws, namely the leaving of \"gleanings\" from certain crops, the Shulchan Aruch argues that during the exile Jewish farmers are not obliged to obey it. Nevertheless, in modern Israel, rabbis of Orthodox Judaism insist that Jews allow \"gleanings\" to be consumed by the poor and by strangers, and all crops (not just \"gleanings\") by anyone and everyone (free, not bought nor sold) during sabbatical years.\n\nIn addition, one must be very careful about how one gives out tzedakah money. It is not sufficient to just give to anyone or any organization, rather, one must check the credentials and finances to be sure that your Tzedakah money will be used wisely, efficiently and effectively \"Do not steal from a poor person, for (s)he is poor,\" (Proverbs 22:22) and from Talmudic-era commentaries including Numbers Rabba 5:2. It is taught that Tzedakah money was never yours to begin with; rather, it always belongs to God, who merely entrusts you with it so that you may use it properly. Hence it is your obligation to ensure that it is received by those deserving of it.\n\nThere are many examples of Tzedakah funds that operate according to Maimonides' principles above (particularly #2), including Hands on Tzedakah (working with nonprofits in the U.S. and in Israel), and Mitzvah Heroes Fund (working mainly with nonprofits in Israel). Paamonim is a nonprofit organization in Israel that operates according to Maimonides' first principle.\n\nGaon of Vilna considered about giving Tzedaqah \"to all householders in our city with tax-benefit\".\n\nThe primary counterpart in Islam is Zakat (Arabic: زكاة), as that refers to one's religious obligation based on those Muslims who meet the necessary criteria of wealth.\n\n\n"}

It was implemented in 2006 and was the highest windfall profits tax in the world. It was a tax on unsmelted copper and gold concentrate that was produced in Mongolia. The tax was repealed in 2009 and phased out over two years. Repealing the 68% tax law was considered essential to enable foreign mining companies to invest in mineral resources development of Mongolia.\n\nThe tax was initially proposed to the State Great Khural (the Mongolian Parliament) in 2005, initially taxing copper and gold profits when their respective prices reach $2,600 per tonne and $500 per troy ounce. The bill passed in May 2006, a change to the law occurred in 2006 changing the gold price that would be taxed to $650 per ounce, and eventually to $850 per ounce. The tax rate was 68%, which was the highest in the world. The tax was implemented with the hopes that copper mining companies would smelt their copper within the country rather than shipping concentrate out as there would be no windfall tax if the material was smelted in Mongolia. \n\nThe implementation of the tax was not anticipated by Vancouver-based Ivanhoe Mines, owners of the Oyu Tolgoi Project in Mongolia. Following the announcement by the government shares of Ivanhoe (traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange) dropped over 21% (or CA$2.22)).\n\nIvanhoe made the case that addition of a smelter to the Oyu Tolgoi Project would increase the capital required to bring the project into production. Others suggested that the small scale independent miners would simply not report their full production to the government, or turn to smuggling to avoid the tax. There was opposition to the rate being established by the Mongol Bank by appointment of the government, and a claim that it was against the constitution. The Constitution Court of Mongolia later determined that this was not a violation. In 2009 the tax was repealed with a phase out period lasting until 2011. \n\nRio Tinto and its partner Ivanhoe Mines made the scrapping of the tax a precondition to their signing an agreement to establish the Oyu Tolgoi mine, a major copper-gold mining project in the Gobi Desert. The government agreed to the removal of the tax in return for an increase in royalties from Oyu Tolgoi. The tax was repealed in early 2011, with Oyu Tolgoi commencing commercial production in 2013.\n"}
{"id": "15951466", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15951466", "title": "Women and animal advocacy", "text": "Women and animal advocacy\n\nWomen have played a central role in animal advocacy since the 19th century. The animal advocacy movement – embracing animal rights, animal welfare, and anti-vivisectionism – has been disproportionately initiated and led by women, particularly in the United Kingdom. Women are more likely to support animal rights than men. A 1996 study of adolescents by Linda Pifer suggested that factors that may partially explain this discrepancy include attitudes towards feminism and science, scientific literacy, and the presence of a greater emphasis on \"nurturance or compassion\" amongst women. Although vegetarianism does not necessarily imply animal advocacy, it is also worth noting that a 1992 market research study conducted by the Yankelovich research organization concluded that \"of the 12.4 million people [in the US] who call themselves vegetarian, 68% are female, while only 32% are male\".\n\n[[Image:Wollstonecraft-right-of-woman.jpg|right|thumb|200px|When the British author [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] wrote \"[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]\" in 1792, an anonymous tract, \"A Vindication of the Rights of Brutes\" (brutes meaning animals) immediately appeared as a parody.]]\nWomen and animals were often considered equally irrational and inferior in the past. When the British author [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] wrote \"[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]\" in 1792, British philosopher [[Thomas Taylor (neoplatonist)|Thomas Taylor]] responded anonymously in the same year with \"A Vindication of the Rights of Brutes\", in which he claimed that arguments for the oppression or liberation of women applied equally well to animals, intending it as a \"[[reductio ad absurdum]]\" of Wollstonecraft's position.\n\nMany of the major British animal advocacy groups founded in the late 1800s and early 1900s, all regarded as radical in their time, were founded by women, including the [[Battersea Dogs' Home]] (Mary Tealby, 1860), the [[National Anti-Vivisection Society]] ([[Frances Power Cobbe]], from Ireland, 1875), the [[British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection]] ([[Frances Power Cobbe]], from Ireland, 1898), and the British [[Animal Defence and Anti-Vivisection Society]] ([[Lizzy Lind af Hageby]], from Sweden, and [[Nina Douglas-Hamilton, Duchess of Hamilton]], 1903.)\n\nIn 1867 the American philanthropist [[Caroline Earle White]] co-founded the Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; she also founded its women's branch in 1869, and founded the [[American Anti-Vivisection Society]] in 1883.\n\nIn 1880, the English feminist [[Anna Kingsford]] became one of the first English women to graduate in medicine, after studying for her degree in Paris, and the only student at the time to do so without having experimented on animals. She published \"The Perfect Way in Diet\" (1881), advocating vegetarianism, and was also vocal in her opposition to animal experiments.\n\nThe British [[Animal Defence and Anti-Vivisection Society]] came to widespread attention during the [[Brown Dog affair]] (1903–1910), which began when [[Lizzy Lind af Hageby]] infiltrated the [[vivisection]] in University College London of a brown terrier dog. The subsequent description of the experiment in her book, \"The Shambles of Science\" (1903) – in which she wrote that the dog had been conscious throughout and in pain – led to a protracted scandal and a libel case, which the accused researcher won. The affair however continued for several years, making a name both for Lind af Hageby and for the society.\n\nBritish political scientist [[Robert Garner]] writes that 70 percent of the membership of the Victoria Street Society (one of the anti-vivisection groups founded by [[Frances Power Cobbe]]) were women, as were 70 percent of the membership of the British [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] in 1900.\n\nAustralian writer and academic [[Coral Lansbury]] writes that the [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|suffragist movement]] in the United Kingdom became closely linked with the anti-[[vivisection]] movement. Writing about the [[Brown Dog affair]], she argues that the iconography of vivisection struck a chord with women. The vivisected dog muzzled and strapped to the operating board, she argues, was a symbolic reminder of the suffragette on [[hunger strike]] restrained and force-fed in [[Brixton Prison]], as well as women strapped into the gynaecologist's chair by their male doctors, for childbirth, for sterilization, as a cure for \"[[hysteria]]\", and as objects of study by male medical students.\n\nIn 1944 the [[Vegan Society]], a registered charity and the oldest vegan society in the world, was founded on 1 November in the UK by Elsie \"Sally\" Shrigley, and 24 others.\n\nThe first vegan society in the United States was founded in 1948 by Catherine Nimmo and Rubin Abramowitz in California, who distributed [[Donald Watson]]'s newsletter.\n\nThe earliest documented practice of [[trap-neuter-return]] was in the 1950s, led by animal activist Ruth Plant in the U.K.\n\nIn 1951 the [American] [[Animal Welfare Institute]] was founded by Christine Stevens.\n\nOn November 22, 1954, the [[Humane Society of the United States]] was founded by Marcia Glaser, Helen Jones, and two men.\n\nIn 1962 the [[Animal Welfare Board of India]] was founded by [[Rukmini Devi Arundale]].\n\nIn 1964 the British author [[Ruth Harrison]] published \"Animal Machines\", an influential critique of factory farming, and on October 10, 1965, the British novelist [[Brigid Brophy]] had an article, \"The Rights of Animals\", published in \"The Sunday Times\". Brophy wrote:\n\nThe relationship of [[homo sapiens]] to the other animals is one of unremitting exploitation. We employ their work; we eat and wear them. We exploit them to serve our superstitions: whereas we used to sacrifice them to our gods and tear out their entrails in order to foresee the future, we now sacrifice them to science, and experiment on their entrail in the hope—or on the mere offchance—that we might thereby see a little more clearly into the present ... To us it seems incredible that the Greek philosophers should have scanned so deeply into right and wrong and yet never noticed the immorality of slavery. Perhaps 3000 years from now it will seem equally incredible that we do not notice the immorality of our own oppression of animals. \n\nBritish political scientist [[Robert Garner]] writes that [[Ruth Harrison]]'s book and [[Brigid Brophy]]'s article led to an explosion of interest in the relationship between humans and nonhumans. In particular, Brophy's article was discovered in or around 1969 by a group of postgraduate philosophy students at the University of Oxford, Roslind and Stanley Godlovitch (wife and husband from Canada), John Harris, and [[David Wood (philosopher)|David Wood]], now known as the [[Oxford Group (animal rights)|Oxford Group]]. They decided to put together a symposium to discuss the theory of animal rights. Around the same time, the British writer [[Richard D. Ryder]] wrote several letters to \"The Daily Telegraph\" criticizing animal experimentation; these letters were seen by Brophy, who put Ryder in touch with the Godlovitches and Harris. Harrison, Brophy, and Ryder subsequently became contributors to the Godlovitches' symposium, which was published in 1971 as \"[[Animals, Men and Morals: An Inquiry into the Maltreatment of Non-humans]]\" (edited by Roslind and Stanley Godlovitch and John Harris).\n\nIn the mid-1960s, English former model [[Celia Hammond]] gained publicity for her [[trap-neuter-return]] work \"at a time when euthanasia of feral cats was considered the only option.\" Hammond \"fought many battles with local authorities, hospitals, environmental health departments\" but stated that she succeeded over the years in showing that control \"could be achieved by neutering and not killing.\" In 1986 she founded the Celia Hammond Animal Trust with the aim of opening a low-cost neutering clinic to control the feral animal population. The first of these clinics opened in [[Lewisham]] in 1995, and a second opened in [[Canning Town]] in 1999. The Celia Hammond Animal Trust also runs a sanctuary in [[Brede, East Sussex]], for animals which need new homes. In addition to neutering animals, the clinics (and sanctuary) also help to rescue and rehome animals, and now find homes for thousands of cats each year.\n\nIn 1973 Dr. Shirley McGreal founded the [[International Primate Protection League]] in Thailand.\n\nIn 1980 the English-born British/American animal rights activist [[Ingrid Newkirk]] co-founded [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]].\n\nIn 1981 Feminists for Animal Rights was founded in California; it became a nationwide organization in the following years and was active nationwide for over two decades, but is now defunct.\n\nIn 1984 [[Virginia McKenna]] OBE founded the [[Born Free Foundation]] together with her husband Bill Travers OBE and their son Will Travers OBE. The Born Free Foundation is a dynamic international wildlife charity. Born Free takes action worldwide to save lives, stop suffering and protect species in the wild. \n\nIn 1986, [[Lorri Houston]] co-founded [[Farm Sanctuary]], America's first shelter for farm animals.\n\nIn 1990 the American author [[Carol J. Adams]] published her influential book \"The Sexual Politics of Meat: A Feminist-Vegetarian Critical Theory\", which discusses the connections between [[feminism]] and [[vegetarianism]] and [[patriarchy]] and meat eating, historically and through the reading of literary texts.\n\nAlso in 1990, during the March for Animals in Washington, D.C. – the largest animal rights demonstration held until then in the United States – most of the participants were women, but most of the platform speakers were men.\n\nIn 1994 [[Louise Wallis]], then President and Chair of the [[Vegan Society]] UK, founded [[World Vegan Day]] to commemorate the society's 50th anniversary. [[Veganism|Vegans]] around the world now join together to celebrate animal rights every World Vegan Day, held annually on November 1.\n\nIn 1998 [[Animals Asia]] was founded by [[Jill Robinson]] MBE; it works to end the bear bile trade in Asia. The charity has two bear sanctuaries in China and Vietnam and has rescued over 500 bears. It also works to end the trade in cats and dogs as food in China and Vietnam, and campaigns for the end of abusive captive animal practices in safari parks and zoos in Asia.\n\nIn 2006 in the Netherlands, [[Marianne Thieme]] and [[Esther Ouwehand]] were elected to parliament representing the [[Party for Animals]].\n\nWomen have also featured prominently in actions carried out in the name of the [[Animal Liberation Front]] and the [[Hunt Saboteurs Association]].\n\nIn 2015, [[Jo-Anne McArthur]] (We Animals) and Keri Cronin (Department of Visual Arts, [[Brock University]]), launched The Unbound Project, a multimedia and book project that celebrates the women who have been at the forefront of animal advocacy around the globe.\n\n\n[[Category:Animal rights]]\n[[Category:Women in society]]"}
