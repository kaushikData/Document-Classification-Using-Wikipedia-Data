Mosher, President of Population Research Institute. The book is written in biographical style that takes the reader from the earliest memories of Chi-An, a Chinese female born on the year of the founding of the People's Republic of China (1949), through to her seeking asylum in the United States due to her pregnancy, which was illegal due to China's one-child policy.\n\nWith names changed to prevent retribution by the Communist Party of China (CPC), Mosher writes in the first person about \"Chi An\", a girl born to a Chinese family with the traditional beliefs that boys were worth more than girls. As such, her family had no birthday celebration for her and did not mark the date of her birth down. The first few chapters cover significant memories from childhood, including the death of her father and the trials underwent by her family during the Great Chinese Famine brought about by agricultural mismanagement as well as highly inflated reports of crop production figures.\n\nChi An grew up surrounded by the ideologies of the Communist Party and in her youth worked for the CPC. Later in life, Chi An studied to become a nurse where she performed her first abortion at age 16, thus beginning her career as a nurse carrying out the One-child Policy through abortion, contraception, and sterilizations all in efforts to meet the birth quotas imposed by party officials. Chi An finds a suitor and they become married, after a fashion, and have a healthy baby boy as their first child. The couple became pregnant with a second child, but were forced to abort the baby as it was illegal.\n\nChi An takes a job at the Liaoning Truck Factory as a company nurse, where all female employees are required once a month to write down on a public message board that they are obeying the CPC and its single-child directives by not becoming pregnant. Around this time, Chi An's husband is granted a student visa to study abroad in the United States. Chi An's husband invited her and their child to the United States to be with him after they had received temporary visas. During their time in the United States, Chi An becomes pregnant. Her superiors at the Liaoning Truck Factory and those involved in the enforcement of the One-child policy pressure Chi An to abort her child as it is a second child and thus illegal. In the story, Chi An reveals that CPC members visit her family and threaten them with punitive action unless \"remedial measures\" are taken, that is to say, an abortion on the second child. Chi An and her husband seek asylum in the United States in order to live there and have their second child far away from the reach of the CPC. With the help of Mosher, Chi An and family are granted asylum.\n"}

It was an emergency measure passed in anticipation of war with Germany, and received royal assent on the day that Germany invaded Poland, beginning the Second World War. Among other things, it reduced the number of people required to serve on a jury in civil or criminal cases from twelve to seven (except in the most serious criminal cases). It also raised the age limit for jury service from 60 to 65, and abolished trial by jury in civil cases, except in cases where the judge ordered that a jury trial was to take place. This was due to the large numbers of people who were expected to be conscripted in the event of a war. The Act was to have effect until the end of the war, when it would be suspended by an Order in Council.\n\nSimilar legislation was passed for Scotland and Northern Ireland. In Scotland, where a unanimous verdict was not always required, a majority verdict could be given by five of the seven jurors.\n\nSection 7(1) read:\n\n\"Notwithstanding anything in any enactment, for the purpose of any trial with a jury or inquiry by a jury in any proceedings, whether civil or criminal, it shall not be necessary for the jury to consist of more than seven persons:<br>\n\"Provided that the preceding provisions of this subsection shall not apply in relation to the trial of a person on any charge, if the court or a judge thinks fit, by reason of the gravity of the matters in issue, to direct that those provisions shall not apply, and shall not in any case apply in relation to the trial of a person on a charge of treason or murder.\"\n\nSection 8(1) read:\n\n\"No question arising in any civil proceedings in the High Court or in any inferior court of civil jurisdiction shall be tried with a jury, and no writ of enquiry for the assessment of damages or other claim by a jury shall issue, unless the court or a judge is of opinion that the question ought to be tried with a jury or, as the case may be, the assessment ought to be made by a jury and makes an order to that effect.\"\n\n\n"}

While anecdotal evidence is typically unscientific, in the last several decades the \"evaluation\" of anecdotes has received sustained academic scrutiny from economists and scholars such as Felix Salmon S. G. Checkland (on David Ricardo), Steven Novella, R. Charleton, Hollis Robbins, Kwamena Kwansah-Aidoo, and others. These academics seek to quantify the value of the use of c awareness of a disease. More recently, economists studying choice models have begun assessing anecdotal value in the context of framing; Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky suggest that choice models may be contingent on stories or anecdotes that frame or influence choice. As an example, consider Joseph Stalin's apocryphal quote: The death of one man is a tragedy, the death of millions is a statistic.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4467828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4467828", "title": "Building regulations in the United Kingdom", "text": "Building regulations in the United Kingdom\n\nThe UK's Building regulations are statutory instruments that seek to ensure that the policies set out in the relevant legislation are carried out. Building regulations approval is required for most building work in the UK. Building regulations that apply across England and Wales are set out in the Building Act 1984 while those that apply across Scotland are set out in the Building (Scotland) Act 2003. The Act in England and Wales permits detailed regulations to be made by the Secretary of State. The regulations made under the Act have been periodically updated, rewritten or consolidated, with the latest and current version being the Building Regulations 2010. The UK Government (at Westminster) is responsible for the relevant legislation and administration in England, the Welsh Government (at Cardiff) is the responsible body in Wales, the Scottish Government (at Edinburgh) is responsible for the issue in Scotland, and the Northern Ireland Executive (at Belfast) has responsibility within its jurisdiction. There are very similar (and technically very comparable) Building Regulations in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe detailed requirements of Building regulations in England (and Wales) are scheduled within 16 separate headings, each designated by a letter (\"Part A\" to \"Part Q\"), and covering aspects such as \"workmanship\", \"adequate materials\", \"structure\", \"waterproofing\" & \"weatherisation\", \"fire safety\" & \"means of escape\", \"sound isolation\", \"ventilation\", \"safe (potable) water\", \"protection from falling\", \"drainage\", \"sanitary facilities\", \"accessible access\" & \"facilities for the disabled\", \"electrical safety\", \"security of a building\",\"high speed broadband infrastructure\", and so on.\n\nFor each Part, detailed specifications are available free online (in the English and Welsh governments's \"approved documents\") describing the matters to be taken into account. The approved documents are not literally legally binding in how the requirements must be met; rather, they present the expectation of the Secretary of State concerning the minimum appropriate standards required for compliance with the Building Regulations, and the common methods & materials used to achieve these. The use of appropriate British Standards and/or European Standards is also accepted as one way of complying with the Building Regulations requirements.\n\nHowever, the supply of gas (natural and/or LPG) is not controlled by the Building Regulations, as there are separate Gas Safety Regulations enforced by the Health and Safety Executive HSE).\n\nNewer versions of Building Regulations are generally not retrospective, they are applied to each new change or modification to a building (or new part of a building) but do not require renovation of existing elements. There are general requirements for any change or improvement, that the building must not be left any less satisfactory in compliance than before the works, and areas worked on must not be left in unsafe condition by reference to current standards. The Regulations may also specify in some cases, that when enough work is done in an area (such as partial new insulation) the remainder of that area must be brought to an appropriate standard, however the standard required for an existing building may be less stringent than that required for a completely new building.\n\nThe Regulations also specify, that some types of work must be undertaken by an appropriate qualified professional (such as works on gas or certain electrical matters), or must be notified to the relevant local authority's Building regulations approval for certification or approval.\n\nHowever, it should be remembered that the Building regulations are separate and distinct from Town Planning and planning permission; the building regulations control how buildings are to be designed or modified on the public grounds of safety and sustainability while planning permission is concerned with \"appropriate development\", the \"nature of land usage\", and the appearance of \"neighbourhoods.\" Therefore, both must be considered when building works are to be undertaken.\n\nFrom 1 January 2005 the term \"building work\" includes work on \"household electrics\".\n\nThe Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006 made provision for microgeneration to be brought within the Building Regulations, and increased to two years the time limit for prosecuting contraventions of the regulations relating to energy use, energy conservation or carbon emissions. It also requires the Secretary of State to report on compliance with these aspects of the Building Regulations and steps proposed to increase compliance. However, no such regulations have been laid.\n\nFrom 6 April 2006, the Building Regulations are extended by amendments to incorporate some of the European Directives requiring energy in existing and new buildings to be measured, etc. The core term \"building work\" was once again amended and extended in scope to include \"renovation of thermal elements\", and energy used by space cooling systems as well as energy used by space heating systems. Both are now subject to efficiency limits, and energy use controls are required. New additional \"competent persons\" schemes were proposed and authorised, in respect of energy systems and energy efficient design.\n\nThere are currently sixteen parts (sections) to the building regulations (E & W) and each is lettered as Part A to Part Q (however there is no Part I or N) accompanied by an \"approved document for that Part X\". The approved documents usually take the form of firstly stating the legislation and then providing a number of methods or ways which are \"deemed to satisfy\" the regulations.\n\nThe building regulations do not aim to stifle innovation, and each Approved Document's introduction states this Government Aim. Compliance with the legislation is what is ultimately required and there may be many ways of complying, other than just using the ways set out in the recommended provisions within each of the approved documents. In reality, an innovative solution may be hard to validate, and for most building work the tendency is to take the regulations literally.\n\nFor example, bathroom manufacturers produce a 'Doc M Pack' for disabled toilets, which reproduces exactly the diagram in Part M, and most public disabled toilets are now designed around this layout.\n\nMany manufactured products have \"agrément certificates\" issued by the British Board of Agrément (BBA, a construction products certification service), certifying compliance with relevant standards. However, the BBA and other bodies (TRADA, BRE, Exova Warrington, etc.) may be able to test and certify to \"CE\" harmonised EU standards. \"CE\" marking of all construction materials and products is now a legal requirement, since 1 July 2013.\n\nMost of the detailed information on the Building Regulations is now available on http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/buildingregulations/ where general public users can access simplified building regulations guidance, and professional users have a better organised version of what was on the former DCLG building regulations website, including the full versions of the \"Approved documents\" and \"associated guidance\", held on the DCLG website (now a constituent part of the gov.uk website).\n\nThis Part requires buildings to be designed, constructed and altered so as to be structurally safe and robust, and also so as not to impair the structural stability of other buildings.\n\nIt stipulates design standards that should be adopted for use on all buildings and additionally gives simple design rules for most masonry and timber elements for traditional domestic buildings.\n\nThe weight of the building from the walls, furniture and people in the building will be transmitted to the ground, so as not to cause instability to the building or other buildings.\n\nRequires buildings to be built in a way ensuring no collapse will occur disproportionately to its cause.\n\nGround movement such as freezing of subsoil will not impair the stability of the building.\n\nThe Party Wall, etc. Act 1996 also controls walls and foundations being built near to existing buildings. However, it is \"civil law\" and is not enforced by Building Control Bodies.\n\nThe building regulations consider five aspects of fire safety in the construction of buildings:\n\nRequirement B1 - Means of early warning of fire and adequate means of escape from the building (including emergency lighting and fire exit signage).\n\nRequirement B2 - Control of Internally fire spread (linings)\n\nThe wall lining i.e. plaster, plasterboard or wooden boards on the walls and ceiling will resist the spread of flames and give off only reasonable levels of heat, if on fire.\n\nRequirement B3 - Control of Internal fire spread (structure) will be maintained during a fire, and fire spread will be prevented.\n\nFire and smoke will be prevented from spreading to concealed spaces in a building's structure by Fire Stopping and Fire Cavity Barriers.\n\nRequirement B4 External fire spread – The external walls and roof will resist spread of fire to walls and roofs \"of other buildings\".\n\nHowever, Not all buildings are required to have non-combustible exterior finishes.\n\nRequirement B5 The building will be accessible for firefighters and their equipment, without delay.\n\nTall and Large buildings to have Fire Lifts and Fire Mains (Dry or Wet riser pipes), etc.\n\nUsing BS9999 : 2017 for non-residential buildings\n\nUsing BS9991 : 2015 for dwellings and other residential buildings\n\nThe use of a Fire Engineer to computer model the building layout and smoke behavior in such a building.\n\nThis requires the designer and/or constructor to give the fire safety information (for a description of the information required – see Appendix G of approved document B) to the Responsible Person, upon completion. This is to enable a competent person to carry out a fire risk assessment.\n\nOnce a building is occupied the Fire Safety Order 2005 requires a Fire Risk Assessment to be carried out, to take into account how the users are actually using the building (and any fire risks that brings to the building) and the FSO2005 requires the \"Responsible Person(s)\" for the building to provide and maintain \"suitable and sufficient\" general fire precautions. (Full citation is the \"Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005\"). Scotland's Fire Safety legislation is very similar and only slightly different in practical effect.\n\nThe Fire Safety Order 2005 is criminal law, and breaches of this law can result in the \"Responsible Person\" being jailed for up to two years and fined up to £10,000 for each offence. Corporate offences may have unlimited fines.\n\nEnforcement is by the local fire authority. It may be necessary to exceed the recommendations of the guidance supporting Part B of Schedule 1 to Building Regulations, in order to achieve a suitable and sufficient level of fire safety required under the Fire Safety Order 2005.\n\nBuilding regulations are technically under constant review by the DCLG (and are currently being urgently reviewed in light of Grenfell Tower fire). As following this fatal fire in London in June 2017, there is industry wide concern over fire safety issues with many other buildings. Inappropriate combustible material combinations have been found on a broad range of tall local authority, private, NHS, educational and housing association buildings.\n\nCombustible materials within the external construction of the outside of tall buildings must comply with the building regulations but this guidance has sometimes been interpreted as applying only to the insulation and not to the cladding.. There are concerns that fire tests may not accurately reflect real life when a building, cladding and insulation are subject to wear and tear. The DCLG has set up a weekly email newsletter for those interested in this topic.\n\nNothing should be growing on the ground covered by the building.\n\nPrecautions must be taken to stop gases and dangerous substances from previous land use from entering the building and endangering the health and safety of occupants.\n\nSubsoil drainage will be in place, if needed, to stop the passage of ground moisture to the interior of the building and to prevent damage to the fabric of the building.\n\nThe walls, floors and roof of the building shall prevent moisture passing to the inside of the building.\n\nThe building must have provision to prevent condensation occurring in the roof structure.\n\nComplaints arose in the Bristol area after Storm Emma in February 2018 that the attics of more than 50 newly built homes had filled up with snow. Barratt Developments and Redrow plc denied any liability, saying that “Lofts in modern homes are designed to act as home ventilators and to eradicate moisture and condensation issues. The vents are installed in order to comply with building regulations and as such the homes affected by the snow were not defective in any way.”\n\nSome Insulating Materials inserted into (existing) cavity walls can give off toxic fumes. Preventative measures must be taken to stop these fumes reaching occupants of the building. However now largely obsolete as injected materials are now mostly blown chopped fiber and not mixed on-site \"chemical reaction\" based methods.\n\nSee Part C for controls on toxic hazards from \"ground contaminants\" and/or \"brownfield\" development.\n\nApproved Document E 2003 plus amendments 2004 should be read in conjunction with supplemental document 'Robust Details Part E - Resistance to the passage of sound'.\n\nSeparating floors and walls \"between domestic dwellings\" are required to meet a minimum sound insulation performance standard. This applies to both new 'purpose built' and converted 'material change of use' properties.\n\nNew internal walls and floors within dwelling-houses, flats and rooms for residential purposes, whether purpose built or formed by material change of use should achieve a minimum performance of Rw 40 dB when tested in a laboratory. Test data is to be taken from a UKAS accredited laboratory.\n\nPre-completion sound tests have been required since July 2003 to ensure compliance with Approved Document E, unless the Robust Details approach is adopted, see Part L below. Testing is to be undertaken by a UKAS registered test organisation or European equivalent (e.g. ANC). A list of preferred UKAS accredited companies can be found at UKAS Organisation Search. A list of preferred ANC accredited companies can be found at www.association-of-noise-consultants.co.uk.\n\nCare should be taken to ensure site conditions are appropriate before testing commences to ensure tests can be completed and that the best results are achieved.\n\nStandards for ventilation and air quality requirements for all buildings are included in this part of the building regulations\n\nDue to the increasing complexity of the Regulations, ventilation strategies and system design must be considered at the earliest stages of building design.\n\nThe Building Regulations consider three ventilation types:\n\nThe performance rates for each of the \"system\" approaches set out in Part F are the minimum requirements needed to ensure that adequate air quality is provided for people indoors. The occupants' health could be at risk if these ventilation rates are compromised.\n\nThe performance rates do not take account of summer overheating.\n\nMost systems may be manually or automatically controlled (with manual override).\n\nFor each system to be effective, air must be able to flow through the dwelling. The regulations make provision for this via internal door undercuts to maintain a minimum gap of 10mm above the finished floor surface. This provides a 7600mm² permanent opening when a door is closed.\n\nThere are alternative methods to achieve compliance with Part F. The following explanations are simplified versions of the most common methods of interpreting the \"Systems\" approach set out in the provisions section of the Regulation.\n\nBackground ventilators are now measured in equivalent area (mm² EA) which is a better measure of performance but does not directly relate to the physical size of the opening through the ventilator.\n\nAdequate sanitation facilities i.e. toilet.\n\nA house must have either a bath or shower with the ability to heat hot water.\n\nUnvented hot water storage systems – restrictions apply to who can install the system.\n\nAn adequate system to carry water used for cooking, washing, toilet, bath or shower to a sewer, cesspool or settlement tank must be in place.\n\nA cesspool or settlement tank must be impermeable to liquids and have adequate ventilation. It must also have means of access for emptying, not harm the health of any person and not contaminate water or water supply.\n\nAn adequate system to carry rainwater away from the roof of a building e.g. guttering carrying water to a sewer.\n\nA place to put a wheelie bin or dustbin. The place must not harm anyone's health.\n\nMust have an adequate air supply for combustion and for efficient working of a flue pipe or chimney.\n\nAppliances shall discharge the products of combustion to the outside.\n\nThe appliance, fireplace and chimney shall reduce the risk of the building catching fire.\n\nSee Part B for general fire safety.\n\nPart K sets minimum standards for the safety of stairways, ramps and ladders, together with requirements for balustrading, windows, and vehicle barriers to prevent falling from floor edges, etc.\n\nGlass and glazing safety is also covered. Also included are requirements for guarding where there is a risk of falling, pedestrian and vehicle barriers, and requirements to prevent injury from (opening) doors and windows.\n\nGlazing that people come into contact with whilst in a building, should, if broken, break in a way unlikely to cause injury, resist impact without breaking or be shielded or protected from impact.\n\nBuildings, other than dwellings that have transparent glazing which people come into contact with while moving around a building, must have features to make it apparent.\n\nWindows that can be opened must be operated safely and provision made for safe accessible cleaning.\n\nPart K also includes safety requirements relating to the use, operation, and cleaning of windows\n\nPart K also includes safety requirements for automatic doors, barriers, shutters and gates.\n\nApproved documents L1 is specific to dwellings and L2 relates to all buildings other than dwellings.\n\nAs of 6 April 2006 (2010) (2014) split into four sections:\n\nPart L controls the insulation values of building elements, the allowable area of windows, doors and other openings, air permeability of the structure, the heating efficiency of boilers and the insulation and controls for heating appliances and systems together with hot water storage and lighting efficiency. It also sets out the requirements for SAP (Standard Assessment Procedure) calculations and carbon emission targets for dwellings.\n\nRegulation 16 requires the advertising of the SAP rating in all new dwellings, and in the EPC document.\n\nApproved Document L1 is supported by a set of 'robust' construction details, now known as \"Accredited Construction Details\". which focus on way of limiting air leakage and thermal bridging in construction. By using these tried and tested details, expensive on-site testing can be avoided.\n\nIn addition to insulation requirements and limitation of openings of the building fabric, this part considers solar heating and heat gains to structures, it controls heating, mechanical ventilation and air conditioning systems, lighting efficiency, space heating controls, air permeability, solar emission, the certification, testing and commissioning of heating and ventilation systems, and requirements for energy meters.\n\nAir permeability is measured by air tightness testing for new dwellings (based on a sampling regime), all new buildings other than dwellings and large extensions to buildings other than dwellings.\n\nThese four Approved Documents must be read in conjunction with the supplemental official and industry documents (the 'second tier' guidance documents).\n\nAll EPCs will be based on SAP 2009 calculations from 1 April 2011. It is highly unlikely that many dwellings built to Part L 2010 will be completed before 1 April 2011. However, in the event that any are, the EPC will need to be produced using SAP 2005.\n\nPlease note that all plots require a building control approval submission, and EPC regardless of how many identical properties are to be built in the same development.\n\nLighting, ventilation, solar heat gain and possible overheating will all impact on the potential to hit the 25% reduction target but until now have not really troubled the industry. As U-values falls (see table) and airtightness levels increases, heat loss through 'thermal bridges' becomes more significant. The new regulations give these issues more emphasis. They also require designs to avoid unwanted solar gains, leading to excessive summer temperatures. The need now exists to consider these issues at the design stage.\n\nSee also:\n\nPart M requires the inclusive provision of ease of access to and circulation within all buildings, together with requirements for facilities for disabled people.\n\nBuildings should have reasonable provision:\n\nThe Equality Act 2010 imposed duties on service providers, schools and public bodies in relation to access for people with disabilities. However, the Part M approved document is not written as a means of ensuring compliance with these legal duties. It is written to ensure that the design of a building does not create physical barriers to a building's inclusive use, over its lifetime.\n\nPart M of the Building Regulations relates to the 'Access to and Use of Buildings' and draws largely on the legislation covered by the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and the Disability Discrimination (Employment) Regulations 1996.\n\nThis document is particularly relevant to new build where such properties must comply. If in any doubt as to whether your alterations are affected by this document, the local building control department will be able to assist further. Later alterations of a building must not remove or reduce its accessibility features.\n\nPart N was Repealed in 2013 and these measures were moved into a new consolidated Part K in 2013 (See above).\n\nNew rules for electrical safety in the home, the garden and its outbuildings. This part only applies to dwellings (in some cases, buildings that would be exempt but which take their electrical supply from a dwelling).\nSeveral government approved \"competent persons\" schemes support Part P.\n\nReasonable provision shall be made in the design, installation, inspection and testing of electrical installations in order to protect persons from fire or injury.\n\nSufficient information shall be provided so that persons wishing to operate, maintain or alter an electrical installation can do so with reasonable safety.\n\nCertain types of work require notification to the local authority for building control. In England this is only work within 'Zone 1' of a bathroom, and new consumer units and complete new circuits. In Wales there are more 'notifiable works' including wiring in kitchens and gardens. Installers who are members of an approved \"Competent Persons Scheme\" may carry out such electrical work without the need to submit many such formal building regulations applications, instead notification is performed via their trade body.\n\nIn 2015 a new requirement, Part Q, came into force.\n\nPart Q talks about security in a dwelling with reasonable provisions needing to have been made to resist unauthorised access to any dwelling or any part of a building from which access can be gained to a flat within the building.\n\nPart R was introduced in 2016 and takes effect at the beginning of 2017. It requires \"network termination points\" in buildings to provide access to high-speed Internet via fiber or copper.\n\nExempt buildings include:\n\nThe Building Regulations 2000 have been amended five times since the original statutory instrument was published. A new consolidated edition was published in 2010 – the Building Regulations 2010. These have also now been amended five times since 2010. It is good practice to have exemption confirmed by the relevant local authority prior to starting construction works or alterations. The latest statutory instrument gives the full conditions of exemptions (and any newly controlled buildings).\n\nCrown buildings (national government buildings) are no longer totally exempt the Building Regulations. All Crown buildings must comply with the energy efficiency measures set out in Part L. This is due to EU laws requiring higher energy efficiency in all buildings (new and existing) under European \"climate change\" measures such as the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. EU law requires public buildings to be \"good energy practice\" examples.\n\nNew energy regulations have been made to fully implement these EU laws, where they fall outside the scope of the building regulations.\n\n\nMost of the detailed information on the building regulations is now available on http://www.planningportal.gov.uk where members of the public can now access simplified building regulations guidance and where professional users have a better organised version of what was previously on the DCLG building legislation and building regulations web pages, including the Approved Documents and associated guidance.\n\nThe new DCLG web pages (now found within the gov.uk website) still gives the professional user detailed information on the scope and extent of the building regulations system, in England. The DCLG web pages also hold DCLG policy papers, background papers, research papers and consultation documents on proposed amendments to both the building regulations and Approved Documents.\n"}

Registered Establishments and Accredited Laboratories are under its purview, as are national Trade-Marks and Trade in agricultural products. It also enables the Inspectorate to search and to seize agricultural products.\n\nThe CAPA enables the so-called \"Livestock and Poultry Carcass Grading Regulations\", a voluntary programme established for the better communication between retailers and consumers.\n\nNow governed by the Canadian Beef Grading Agency, the Canadian grading system began in 1929. Grade standards and regulations are now enforced by Canadian Food Inspection Agency employees. Significant changes were introduced to the grading system in 1992, 1996 and 2001. The information collected through the grading process is used in making marketing and production decisions. Producers receive premiums for carcasses with a high grade. In 2016, the General Manager of the CBGA maintained that virtually all fed beef carcasses processed commercially in Canada were graded.\n\nAs of November 2016, there were 30 crops, of which apples and potatoes were two, that came under the purview of the CAPA legislation.\n\nIn 2016, Two executives of Mucci International Marketing Inc. and Mucci Pac Ltd. and their companies were levied fines by the CFIA tribunal that totalled $1.5 million. Their offense was fraudulently to put \"Product of Canada\" labels on large quantities of peppers, tomatoes and cucumbers grown mainly in Mexico. The defendants supplied the mislabelled produce to Costco, to Loblaws and to Sobeys. The fraud at the Ontario Food Terminal was discovered in 2012, and investigators later executed in 2013 and 2014 three search warrants, which resulted in the seizure of more than 70 boxes of documents. A court in Windsor, Ontario heard the case. The agreed statement of facts quoted an email of a Mucci worker, that he was told \"to make it Canada even though it is Mexico.\" The company, which was at the time located in Kingsville, Ontario, was also sentenced to probation for a three-year term.\n\nApples are one of 30 domestically produced commodities whose trade is regulated the Canada Agricultural Products Act. The Canadian International Trade Tribunal ruled in 1995 that American dumping of a number of apple varietals \"has caused, is causing and is likely to cause material injury to the production in Canada of like goods, excluding the period from July 1 to September 30 in each calendar year.\" As such, American growers are currently required to secure a ministerial exemption from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency for bulk apple shipments. The CAPA was threatened in 2017 by President Trump's renewal of NAFTA negotiations. Potatoes are another issue of contention under NAFTA negotiations: Canadian Horticulture Council trade chair Ken Forth told a Commons committee the CAPA \"eliminate the potential dumping of large quantities of potatoes\" that may not meet Canadian grade requirements. \"Such dumping could severely impact the market price for high-quality Canadian products.\"\n\nAs of November 2016, The maximum fine for an indictable offence under the Canada Agricultural Products Act was $250,000.\n\nIn November 2017, a Maidstone, Ontario tomato processing company, that in addition had received a controversial $3-million provincial grant, was convicted of fraudulently mislabelling products as organic under the CAPA as well as other legislation. The owner and the company were also charged with falsifying the country of origin on their products between September 2013 and July 2015, passing off with labels that read \"Product of Canada\" produce that was American in origin. The owner was charged with lying to a federal food inspector on 8 January 2015. The case was heard in the Ontario Court of Justice. Separately, the company went bankrupt, owing more than a hundred creditors a total of over $25 million.\n\nOn 12 March 2018, a Leamington, Ontario greenhouse grower named AMCO Produce and its directors Fausto Amicone and Mark Wehby answered to charges brought by the CFIA for origin-of-vegetable fraud in a Windsor court. The corporation pleaded guilty to three charges under the Food and Drugs Act, the Consumer Packaging and Labeling Act and the CAPA, and was fined $210,000. The individuals were let off in exchange for the guilty plea. The sentence included \"intrusive\" probation for a period of time under which the CFIA gains \"unfettered\" access to company records. The case began when the CFIA did in February 2013 a random inspection at the Ontario Food Terminal. Greenhouse peppers had been fraudulently mislabelled as Ontario produce at a time of year that was too cold for greenhouses to operate. The case covered offenses that occurred over a two-year span of time.\n"}

Individuals who were determined to be competent were issued fee patents on their land. The lands of Indian allotees determined to be non-competent were leased by the Federal Government, often to non-tribal members.\n\nWhile a fee patent gives power to the allottee to decide whether to keep or sell the land, provided the harsh economic reality of the time, lack of access to credit and markets, liquidation of Indian lands was almost inevitable. It was known by the department of interior that virtually 95% of fee patented land would eventually be sold to whites (Robertson, 2002).\n\nIndians who were determined to be non-competent often did not receive the income generated from the leasing of their lands. In 1996, the largest class-action lawsuit ever launched against the U.S. Government, Cobell vs. Norton, was filed on behalf of 300,000 trust fund beneficiaries who offered to settle for 27 billion dollars.\n\n"}
{"id": "2187058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2187058", "title": "Covenant (law)", "text": "Covenant (law)\n\nA covenant in its most general sense and historical sense, is a solemn promise to engage in or refrain from a specified action. Under historical English common law a covenant was distinguished from an ordinary contract by the presence of a seal. Because the presence of a seal indicated an unusual solemnity in the promises made in a covenant, the common law would enforce a covenant even in the absence of consideration. In United States contract law, an implied \"covenant\" of good faith is presumed.\n\nA covenant is a type of agreement analogous to a contractual condition. The covenantor makes a promise to a covenantee to do (affirmative covenant (US) / positive covenant (E&W)) or not do some action (negative covenant). In real property law, the juristic term real covenants means conditions tied to the ownership or use of land. A \"covenant running with the land\", meeting tests of wording and circumstances laid down in precedent, imposes duties or restrictions upon the use of that land regardless of the owner. Restrictive covenants are somewhat similar to easements and equitable servitudes, leading to some discussion about whether these concepts should be unified; in the US the Restatement (Third) of Property takes steps to merge these concepts as servitudes. Real covenant law in the US has been referred to as an \"unspeakable quagmire\" by one court.\n\nCovenants for title are covenants which come with a deed or title to the property, in which the grantor of the title makes certain guarantees to the grantee. Non-compete clauses in the United States are also called restrictive covenants.\n\nLandlords may seek and courts may grant forfeiture of leases such as in leasehold estates for breach of covenant, which in most jurisdictions must be relatively severe breaches, however the covenant to pay rent is one of the more fundamental covenants. The forfeiture of a private home involves interference with social and economic human rights. In the case of leases commuted to a large sum payable at the outset (a premium), this has prompted lobbying for and government measures of leasehold reform particularly in the law of ground rents and service charges.\n\nIn property law, land-related covenants are called \"real covenants\" and are a major form of covenant, typically imposing restrictions on how the land may be used (negative covenants) or requiring a certain continuing action (affirmative covenant). These may also \"run with the land\" (called a \"covenant appurtenant\"), meaning that any future owners of the land must abide by the terms, or may apply to a particular person (called a \"covenant in gross\" or \"of a purely personal nature\"). Under English law, affirmative covenants typically do not run with the land; in the United States such covenants are examined more closely, but with exceptions affirmative covenants have been permitted to run with the land.\n\nThe covenant may be shown in the deed and should be disclosed to prospective purchasers; it may also be recorded, or in the case of Commonwealth countries shown in Torrens title. Real covenants and easements or equitable servitudes are similar and in 1986, a symposium discussed whether the law of easements, equitable servitudes, and real covenants should be unified. As time passes and the original promisee of the covenant is no longer involved in the land, enforcement may become lax.\n\nCovenants may be imposed through homeowner associations, and controversy has arisen over selective enforcement. Historically, particularly in the United States exclusionary covenants were used to exclude racial minorities. Some covenants exist for safety purposes, such as a covenant forbidding the construction of tall buildings in the vicinity of an airport or one restricting the height of fences/shrubs at street corners (so as not to interfere with drivers' sight lines). Covenants may restrict everything from the height and size of buildings to the materials used in construction to superficial matters such as paint color and holiday decorations. In residential areas, covenants may forbid \"dirty\" businesses (such as feedlots or chemical production facilities) or business use entirely, or modifications such as amateur radio antenna. Amateur radio restrictions have been particularly controversial; in 1985 the U.S. Federal Communications Commission issued PRB-1 preempting state and local restrictions, but not private restrictions; in 2012 after Congress passed a law requiring study of this issue (at the urging of amateur radio group ARRL), the FCC declined to extend this preemption. Some US states have enacted legislation requiring homeowners' associations to provide reasonable accommodations for amateur radio antennas under the rationale that amateur radio provides public service communications in the event of an emergency, major disaster, or special event.\n\nIn Canada, governmental authorities may use restrictive covenants as well as zoning. For instance, the city of Calgary's requirement that buildings in the general vicinity of Calgary International Airport be under a certain height is registered against virtually every title in the northeast quadrant of the city as a restrictive covenant, not as a zoning by-law.\n\nThe covenant will typically be written in the deed, and must be in writing due to the statute of frauds. Although scholars have argued that some of the following should be significantly relaxed, in order for the burden to run with the land the following must apply:\n\nCourts interpret covenants relatively strictly and give the words of the agreement their ordinary meaning. Generally if there is any unclear or ambiguous language regarding the existence of a covenant courts will favor free alienation of the property. Courts will not read any restrictions on the land by implication (as is done with easements for example). A covenant can be terminated if the original purpose of the covenant is lost. In some cases property owners can petition a court to remove or modify the covenants, and homeowner associations may include procedures for removing the covenants.\n\nThe covenant may be negative or affirmative. A negative covenant is one in which property owners are unable to perform a specific activity, such as block a scenic view. An affirmative covenant is one in which property owners must actively perform a specific activity, such as keeping the lawn tidy or paying homeowner's association dues for the upkeep of the surrounding area.\n\nAn agreement not to open a competing business on adjacent property is generally enforceable as a covenant running with the land. However, under the federal Supreme Court's holding in \"Shelley v. Kraemer\", 334 U.S. 1 (1948), a covenant that restricts sale to a minority person (commonly used during the Jim Crow era) is unenforceable, as enforcement would require the court to act in a racially discriminatory manner, contrary to the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nAt common law, the benefit of a restrictive covenant runs with the land if three conditions are met:\n\nAt common law, the burden of a restrictive covenant does not run except where strict privity of estate (a landlord/tenant relationship) exists.\n\nThe burden can be enforced at law in limited circumstances under the benefit/burden test - that is, whoever takes the benefit must also shoulder the burden. In \"Halsall v Brizell\" [1957] Ch 169, a covenant requiring the upkeep of roads was found to bind the successor in title to the original covenantor because he had elected to take the benefit. The rule in \"Halsall v Brizell\" is limited to cases where the benefit can be linked to a specific burden and where the covenantor's successors in title can physically elect to take the benefit. For example, a restrictive covenant to contribute to the maintenance costs of a common area will not be binding if the covenantor's successors in title have no legal right to use them.\n\nA positive burden can run in law, but not in equity, as it is deemed to be analogous to a contract, to which equitable principles do not apply (\"Rhone v Stephens\" (1994)).\n\nThe burden of a restrictive covenant will run in equity if these prerequisites are met:\n\nThe leading case of restrictive covenants in equity is generally regarded as that of Tulk v Moxhay in which it was determined that the burden could run in equity subject to the qualifications listed above.\n\nIn contemporary practice in the United States, a covenant typically refers to restrictions set on contracts like deeds of sale. \"Covenants, conditions, and restrictions,\" commonly abbreviated \"CC&Rs\" or \"CCRs\", are a complicated system of covenants, known generically as \"deed restrictions,\" built into the deeds of all the lots in a common interest development, particularly in the tens of millions of American homes governed by a homeowner association (HOA) or condominium association. There are some office or industrial parks subject to CCRs as well.\n\nThese CCRs might, for example, dictate the types of structures that can be built (e.g. a CCR may prohibit any type of modular, prefabricated, or mobile home, and/or may require the structure to be a minimum size), appearance (e.g. no junk cars), or other uses (e.g. no operation of home-based business, no pets except traditional household animals). The purpose of this is to maintain a neighborhood character or prevent improper use of the land. Many covenants of this nature were imposed in the United States in the 1920s through the 1940s, before zoning became widespread. However, many modern developments are also restricted by covenants on property titles; this is often justified as a means of preserving the values of the houses in the area. Covenant restrictions can be removed through court action, although this process is lengthy and often very expensive. In some cases it even involves a plebiscite of nearby property owners. Although control of such planning issues is often governed by local planning schemes or other regulatory frameworks rather than through the use of covenants, there are still many covenants imposed, particularly in states that limit the level of control over real property use that may be exercised by local governments.\n\nBefore 1948, these covenants were legally used for segregationist purposes.\nIn the United States in the 1920s and 1930s, covenants that restricted the sale or occupation of real property on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, or social class were common in the United States, where the primary intent was to keep \"white\" neighbourhoods \"white\". Such covenants were employed by many real estate developers to \"protect\" entire subdivisions. The purpose of an exclusionary covenant was to prohibit a buyer of property from reselling, leasing, or transferring the property to members of a given race, ethnic origin, and/or religion as specified in the title deed. Some covenants, such as those tied to properties in Forest Hills Gardens, New York, also sought to exclude working class people; however this type of social segregation was more commonly achieved through the use of high property prices, minimum cost requirements, and application reference checks. In practice, exclusionary covenants were most typically concerned with keeping out African Americans; however, restrictions against Asian-Americans, Jews, and Catholics were not uncommon. For example, the Lake Shore Club District, in Pennsylvania, sought to exclude various minorities, including Negros, Mongolians, Hungarians, Mexicans, Greeks, and various other European ethnicities. Cities known for their widespread use of racial covenants include Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit, Los Angeles, and St. Louis.\n\n90% of the housing projects built in the years following World War II were racially restricted by such covenants.\n\nRacial covenants emerged during the mid-nineteenth century and started to gain prominence from the 1890s onwards. However, it was not until the 1920s that they adopted widespread national significance, a situation that continued until the 1940s. Racial covenants were an alternative to racially restrictive zoning ordinances (residential segregation based on race) that the 1917 US Supreme Court ruling of Buchanan v. Warley invalidated on constitutional grounds. \n\nDuring the 1920s, the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP) sponsored several unsuccessful legal challenges against racial covenants. In a blow to campaigners against racial segregation, the legality of racial restrictive covenants was affirmed by the landmark Corrigan v. Buckley judgment that ruled that such clauses constituted \"private action\" and as such were not subject to the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. As a result of this decision, racial restrictive covenants proliferated across the United States during the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nEven the invalidation of such a covenant by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1940 case of Hansberry v. Lee did little to reverse the trend, because the ruling was based on a technicality and failed to set a legal precedent. It was not until 1948 that the Shelley v. Kraemer judgment overturned the Corrigan v. Buckley decision, stating that exclusionary covenants were unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment and were therefore legally unenforceable.\n\nSome commentators have attributed the popularity of exclusionary covenants at this time as a response to the urbanization of black Americans following World War I, and the fear of \"black invasion\" into white neighborhoods, which residents felt would result in depressed property prices, increased nuisance (crime), and social instability. Many African Americans openly defied these covenants and attempted to \"pioneer\" restricted areas.\n\nIn 1968, Congress passed the Fair Housing Act (Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968) which outlawed housing discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. In 1988, it was expanded to prohibit discrimination based on familial status (e.g. the presence of children) or disability.\n\nAlthough exclusionary covenants are not enforceable today, they still exist in many original property deeds as \"underlying documents\", and title insurance policies often contain exclusions preventing coverage of such restrictions. In 2010, it was found that more than 400 properties in Seattle suburbs alone retained (unenforceable) discriminatory language that had once excluded racial minorities.\n\n\nAlthough most commonly associated with the United States, racially or ethnically restrictive covenants have been used in other countries:\n\nTitle covenants serve as guarantees to the recipient of property, ensuring that the recipient receives what he or she bargained for. \n\nOutside of England and Wales the English covenants of title, sometimes included in deeds to real property, are (1) that the grantor is lawfully seized (in fee simple) of the property, (2) that the grantor has the right to convey the property to the grantee, (3) that the property is conveyed without encumbrances (this covenant is frequently modified to allow for certain encumbrances), (4) that the grantor has done no act to encumber the property, (5) that the grantee shall have quiet possession of the property, and (6) that the grantor will execute such further assurances of the land as may be requisite (Nos. 3 and 4, which overlap significantly, are sometimes treated as one item). The English covenants may be described individually, or they may be incorporated by reference, as in a deed granting property \"with general warranty and English covenants of title...\n\nSince 1989 the main covenants implied in England and Wales, on \"limited\" or \"full title guarantee\" are, (unless expressly overridden):\n\n\nOthers as to charges, incumbrances, and third-party rights vary depending on whether full or limited title guarantee is agreed.\n\n\n"}

The animal shelter is located at Chittur, in Palakkad, Kerala, India. It is the first Gaushala in Kerala. Dakshin Vrindavan saves cows from slaughter houses and cruel transporters and protect them in their shelter. The trust also maintain abandoned cows, bulls, retired oxen and calves in their shelter. Dakshin Vrindavan consist of volunteers who offer their talents and resources to tend to the neglected cows of India. It provides the cows with medical attention, clean water, lush pastures and lifetime accommodation. This charity was founded in the year 2013. This Gaushala is known to be the first and the largest Gaushala in State of kerala.\n\nThe foundation of Dakshin Vrindavan was driven by Ashwin Sampatkumar's and Shankar Rama Varma's experience of visiting an Animal shelter, Care for cows Vrindavan, for welfare cows and bulls saved from slaughter houses in Vrindavan, and the realisation that protection of cows is not a charity but a social responsibility . His Grace Kurma Rupa Dasa, the founder of Care for Cows international, was instrumental in the founding of Dakshin Vrindavan. He personally Guided Ashwin Sampatkumar to open a shelter for cows. Ashwin Sampatkumar soon found his Mentor for life in His Grace Kurma Rupa Dasa. His Grace Kurma Rupa Dasa soon listed Dakshin Vrindavan as of the independent branches of Care For Cows International.\nMr Parasuram's keen interest in helping with the endeavor proved a catalyst in it growing into a vast volunteer network from a pet project. Jaya parasuram (Mr Parasuram's wife), Girish Namboothiri, Ramesh K Varma and Prakash Srinivasan ( under the guidance of Shri. Thondanur Nambi Narayanan) were instrumental in founding and fleshing out the concept of Dakshin Vrindavan, and the seven of them formed a founding core around which friends, peers and the community came together to make the organisation a reality.\n\nThe first generation of Dakshin Vrindavan, started with the rescue of the first member of the shelter Balaram from a farmer who was about to sell him to a butcher, just because he was a bull calf, in 2013. Approximately 10 volunteers joined the cause, and a land was found out for accommodating the calf. The land belonged to a family who helped Dakshin Vrindavan a lot in the initial years . Then came the rescue of almost 5 cows and bulls from illegal transportation, which were also housed in that land and soon after which the organisation formally registered as a Nonprofit organization.\n\nFrom that point on, Dakshin Vrindavan grew exponentially. Many more rescue operation were carried out and abandoned bulls and cows were also rescued.\n\nOn June 2014, the Dakshin vrindavan team spotted a truck full of cows and Bulls in Mangalore which was on its way to slaughter house. The team intervened, sighted laws preventing slaughter of cows in karnataka and saved the cows. An astonishing eleven cows and bulls were saved from the rescue operation. This started the series of rescue operation done by Dakshin Vrindavan.\n\nAfter few months of moving to the 10 acres of land, the Gaushala faced threats from Communist party as cow protection was against their party ideologies. The cows were relocated to a temporary land to ensure their safety. The communist party workers threatened to kill the cows and conduct a beef festival if the gaushala is not shut down. Apparently when the media approached the union Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare S. S. Ahluwalia also the National Vice president of Bharatiya Janata Party,He was outraged and replied \"This is not acceptable\" \" Gaushalas are constructed throughout the country under Article 48 of the Constitution. It is the duty of the Kerala government to take steps to improve the breeding of cows and bulls in the state and prevent them from being slaughtered. It should take action against the culprits in this case and let the Dakshin Vrindavan Gaushala function peacefully\".\n\n\"Saving cows from slaughter and illegal transporting and protecting these cows saved in our shelter\"\n\nTo protect, save and house 1000 cows in our shelter by 2017.\n\nProtection of cows is not a charity but a social responsibility.\n\nThe programmes undertaken by Dakshin Vrindavan are:\n\nAll these years cows were on leased land. In the starting years of Dakshin Vrindavan they were housed in the land provided by a family. But by the end of 2014, they were shifted to the land adjoining a temple near Nurani in Palakkad.\n\n10 acres of land was acquired on the banks of river Chittur by the generous participation of Mr and Mrs Sandeep Gopal, Mr and Mrs Balaji Krishnamachary Iyengar, Mr and Mrs Harish Sivarman, Mr and Mrs Santhosh Kovilakath, Mr and Mrs Sridhar krishnamoorthy, Mr and Mrs Chandru and Mr and Mrs Karthik Iyer and T.K Ramanathan. Dakshin Vrindavan has proposed a Gaushala for accommodating 150 cows with a budget of 50 Lakh Indian Ruppes.\n\nAll these years cows were on leased lands and the shelter made for them were temporary. Now that land has been acquired, Dakshin Vrindavan focuses on building the cows a permanent shelter in 1 acre of the 10 acre acquired. The estimated cost for the construction of this shelter is about 50 Lakh Indian Rupees.\n\nDakshin Vrindavan has started raising funds for this endeavor and expects the completion of this shelter by the mid of 2016.\n"}
{"id": "134233", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=134233", "title": "Damnation", "text": "Damnation\n\nDamnation (from Latin \"damnatio\") is the concept of divine punishment and torment in an afterlife for actions that were committed on Earth. In Ancient Egyptian religious tradition, citizens would recite the 42 negative confessions of Maat as their heart was weighed against the feather of truth. If the citizen's heart was heavier than a feather they would be devoured by Ammit. Zoroastrianism developed an eschatological concept of a Last Judgment called Frashokereti where the dead will be raised and the righteous wade through a river of milk while the wicked will be burned in a river of molten metal. Abrahamic religions such as Christianity have similar concepts of believers facing judgement on a last day to determine if they will spend eternity in Gehenna or heaven for their sin . A damned human \"in damnation\" is said to be either in Hell, or living in a state wherein they are divorced from Heaven and/or in a state of disgrace from God's favor. In traditional Abrahamic demonology, the Devil rules Hell, where he and his demons punish the damned.\n\nFollowing the religious meaning, the words \"damn\" and \"goddamn\" are a common form of religious profanity, in modern times often semantically weakened to the status of mere interjections.\n\nClassical Latin \"damnum\" means \"damage, cost, expense; penalty, fine\", ultimately from a PIE root \"*dap-\". The verb \"damnare\" in Roman law acquired a legal meaning of \"to pronounce judgement upon\".\n\nThe word entered Middle English usage from Old French in the early 14th century.\nThe secular meaning survives in English \"to condemn\" (in a court of law), or \"damning criticism\". The noun \"damnation\" itself is mostly reserved for the religious sense in Modern English, while \"condemnation\" remains common in secular usage.\n\nDuring the 18th century and until about 1930, the use of \"damn\" as an expletive was considered a severe profanity and was mostly avoided in print. The expression \"not worth a damn\" was recorded in 1802. The use of \"damn\" as an adjective, short for \"damned\", was recorded in 1775. \"Damn Yankee\" (a Southern US term for \"Northerner\") dates back to 1812.\n\nIn most forms of Western Christian belief, damnation to hell is what humanity deserves for its sins. Catholic and many Protestant denominations hold that human sin is the product of the fall of man of Adam and Eve in the book of Genesis. In some Christian denominations, only the sins that the Ten Commandments describe cause damnation, but others apply more strict terms. The reasons for being damned have varied widely through the centuries, with little consistency between different forms of Christianity (i.e., Catholic or Protestant). \"Sins\" ranging from murder to dancing have been said to lead to damnation.\nChristian denominations have differing views on soteriology, but a mainstream view is that believers can only escape damnation by salvation from Jesus Christ.\n\nOne conception is of suffering and denial of entrance to Heaven, often described in the book of Revelation as burning in a Lake of Fire. Another conception, derived from the scripture about \"Gehenna\" is simply that people will be discarded (burned), as being unworthy of preservation by God.\n\nIn Eastern Christian traditions (Eastern Orthodoxy and Oriental Orthodoxy), as well as some Western traditions, it is seen as a state of opposition to the love of God, a state into which all humans are born but against which Jesus Christ is the Mediator and Redeemer. Eastern traditions have established their views on Paradise and Gehenna from theologians like Isaac of Nineveh and Basil of Caesarea and the Fathers of the Church. In the Eastern Orthodox tradition theologians can describe God by presenting negative descriptions of what God is not, and describe Gehenna in similar ways.\n\nIn Hindusim, one of the three main acharyas, Acharya Madhva or Madhvacharya differed significantly from traditional Hindu beliefs owing to his concept of eternal damnation. For example, he divides souls into three classes. One class of souls, \"mukti-yogyas\", qualifies for liberation, another, the \"nitya-samsarins\", subject to eternal rebirth or eternal transmigration and a third class, \"tamo-yogyas\", who are condemned to eternal hell (\"andhatamasa\"). No other Hindu philosopher or school of Hinduism holds such beliefs. In contrast, most Hindus believe in universal salvation, that all souls will eventually obtain moksha, even if after millions of rebirths.\n\n\"Damn\" is nowadays a mildly profane word in English, although \"God damn\" (or \"Goddamn\") may be considered blasphemous by religious people, who regard it as a violation of the commandment against taking God's name in vain. \"Dang\" (mainly US) or \"darn\" are common euphemisms, specifically minced oaths, for \"damn\". The profanity of \"damn\" and its derivatives (e.g. \"damned\", \"damnation\") is effectively limited to cases where the word is not used in its literal meaning, e.g., \"The damned dog won't stop barking!\" (but the line of Arthur Miller's character John Proctor to his servant, \"God damns all liars\" uses the word in its literal sense and has not been seen as objectionable).

The victim need not be the perpetrator's biological brother. In a military context, fratricide refers to a service member killing a comrade. \n\nJudeo-Christian religion recognizes the biblical account of Cain and Abel, this fratricide was the first type of murder to be committed. In the mythology of ancient Rome, the city is founded as the result of a fratricide, when the twins Romulus and Remus quarrel over who has the favor of the gods and over each other's plans to build Rome, and Romulus becomes Rome's first king and namesake after killing his brother.\n\nIn the Hindu epic Mahābhārata, Karna was killed by Arjuna who didn't know that Karna was his eldest brother. Though not exactly fratricide the otherwise meticulously pious Arjuna's actions - where he pitilessly and against the rules of honorable warfare slayed an unarmed Karna - are nevertheless considered utterly deplorable and heinous. \nHowever, the context of the crime becomes markedly different when seen from the following angle:\n1. Arjuna was oath-bound to avenge the death of his only son and heir apparent Abhimanyu who had been mercilessly slaughtered by a gang of bloodthirsty warriors which included Karna.\n2. While Arjuna was blissfully unaware that Karna was his own blood-brother, the latter was apprised of the same by their common mother Kunti. And hence, even though he was privy to the bond of brotherhood, Karna still wholeheartedly (due to his allegiance to prince Duryodana) readily elected to indulge in fratricide. \nThe 13th century poet, Kavi Kabila while commenting broadly on the Ramayana and on Rama's killing of Raavan with the active support of the latter's estranged younger brother Vibhisan - on whom Raavan had vowed black vengeance and on the killing of Bali (again by Rama) with the ready contrivance of his younger, disgruntled and banished, sibling Sugreev, has succinctly expressed this in a couplet:\n\"Irony? What Irony?! If not that the seed of destruction carried in the heart of one brother was sowed and reaped to the full by the hand of another!\"\n\nThe only known fratricide in the Roman Empire is the fairly well known murder of Geta on the orders of his brother Caracalla in 211. The brothers had a longtime fraught relationship, and upon their father Septimius Severus's death in February 211, they succeeded him as co-emperors. Their joint rule was very unsuccessful, and each of them kept conspiring to have the other one murdered. In December of that year, Caracalla pretended to be holding a reconciliation in their mother Julia Domna's apartment, and Geta was lured to come unarmed and unguarded. Upon Geta's arrival, a group of Centurions loyal to Caracalla murdered him, Geta dying in his mother's arms. It is said that the fratricide would often come back to haunt Caracalla.\n\nThere are many recorded fratricides in Persia. The most famous story is about Cyrus the Great's sons where Cambyses II killed his brother Bardiya. Also there are stories about the sons of Artaxerxes I, Xerxes II, Sogdianus and Darius II where they fought for the throne. \nAlso there were many fratricides in the Parthian Empire and the Sassanid Empire.\n\nIn the Ottoman Empire a policy of judicial royal fratricide was introduced by Sultan Mehmet II whose grandfather Mehmet I had to fight a long and bloody civil war against his brothers (which brought the empire near to destruction) to take the throne. When a new Sultan ascended to the throne he would imprison all of his surviving brothers and kill them by strangulation with a silk cord as soon as he had produced his first male heir. The largest killing took place on the succession of Mehmet III when 19 of his brothers were killed and buried with their father. The aim was to prevent civil war. Reflecting public disapproval, his successor Ahmed I abandoned the practice, replacing it with life imprisonment in the Kafes, a section of the Ottoman palace.\n\nIn the Mughal Empire, fratricides often occurred as a result of wars of succession. Shah Jahan had his eldest brother Khusrau Mirza killed in 1622. Shah Jahan also had his brother Shahriyar killed in 1628. Shah Jahan's son, Dara Shikoh was assassinated by four of his brother Aurangzeb's henchmen in front of his terrified son on the night of 30 August 1659 (9 September Gregorian).\n\nThe events in the Greek tragedy Antigone unfold due to the previous war between the princely brothers, Eteocles and Polyneices, who killed each other in combat. Polyneices had challenged his brother's claim to the throne of the city Thebes, and attacked the city with an army from Argos. Eteocles fought for Thebes to defend the city against Polyneices and his army. The two killed one another by each stabbing the other in the heart.\n\nAshoka, also known as Chand-Ashoka (Cruel Ashoka), killed his real brothers as punishment for the kings's (his father) death and quarrel for the kingdom (war of succession). Later on, Ashoka conquered Greater India entire, before he adopted Buddhism and forsook war.\n\n\n\n\n\nFamilial killing terms:\n\nNon-familial killing terms from the same root:\n\n"}

State laws (and the laws of Washington, D.C. and the U.S. territories) vary considerably, and are independent of existing federal firearms laws, although they are sometimes broader or more limited in scope than the federal laws.\n\nState level laws vary significantly in their form, content, and level of restriction. Forty-four states have a provision in their state constitutions similar to the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which protects the right to keep and bear arms. The exceptions are California, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, and New York. In New York, however, the statutory civil rights laws contain a provision virtually identical to the Second Amendment. Additionally, the U.S. Supreme Court held in \"McDonald v. Chicago\" that the protections of the Second Amendment to keep and bear arms for self-defense in one's home apply against state governments and their political subdivisions.\n\nFirearm owners are subject to the firearm laws of the state they are in, and not exclusively their state of residence. Reciprocity between states exists in certain situations, such as with regard to concealed carry permits. These are recognized on a state-by-state basis. For example, Idaho recognizes an Oregon permit, but Oregon does not recognize an Idaho permit. Florida issues a license to carry both concealed weapons and firearms, but others license only the concealed carry of firearms. Some states do not recognize out-of-state permits to carry a firearm at all, so it is important to understand the laws of each state when traveling with a handgun.\n\nIn many cases, state firearms laws can be considerably less restrictive than federal firearms laws. This does not confer any \"de jure\" immunity against prosecution for violations of the federal laws. However, state and local police departments are not legally obligated to enforce federal gun law as per the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in \"Printz v. United States\".\n\nFirearm related matters that are often regulated by state or local laws include the following:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2987839", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2987839", "title": "Michelle Remembers", "text": "Michelle Remembers\n\nMichelle Remembers is a 1980 book co-written by Canadian psychiatrist Lawrence Pazder and his psychiatric patient (and eventual wife) Michelle Smith. A best-seller, \"Michelle Remembers\" was the first book written on the subject of satanic ritual abuse and is an important part of the controversies beginning in the 1980s regarding satanic ritual abuse and \"recovered\" memory. The book has subsequently been discredited by several investigations which found no corroboration of the book's events, and that the events described in the book were extremely unlikely and in some cases impossible.\n\n\"Michelle Remembers\" chronicles Pazder's therapy in the late 1970s with his long-time patient Smith. In 1973 Pazder first started treating Smith at his private psychiatric practice in Victoria, British Columbia. In 1976 when Pazder was treating Smith for depression (related to her having had a miscarriage), Smith confided she felt that she had something important to tell him, but could not remember what it was. Shortly thereafter, Pazder and Smith had a session where Smith screamed for 25 minutes non-stop and eventually started speaking in the voice of a five-year-old. Over the next 14 months Pazder spent over 600 hours using hypnosis to help Smith recover alleged memories of satanic ritual abuse that occurred when she was five in 1954 and 1955 at the hands of her mother (Virginia Proby) and others, all of whom Smith said were members of a \"satanic cult\" in Victoria.\n\nThe book documents Smith's memory of events recovered during therapy, documenting the many satanic rituals she believed that she was forced to attend (Pazder stated that Smith was abused by \"the Church of Satan,\" which he states is a worldwide organization predating the Christian church). The first alleged ritual attended by Smith took place in 1954 when she was five years old, and the final one documented in the book was an 81-day ritual in 1955 that summoned the devil himself and involved the intervention of Jesus, the Virgin Mary and Michael the Archangel, who removed the scars received by Smith throughout the year of abuse and removed memories of the events \"until the time was right.\" During the rites, Smith was allegedly tortured, locked in cages, sexually assaulted, forced to take part in various rituals, witnessed several murders and was rubbed with the blood and body parts of various murdered babies and adults.\n\nAfter Smith had seemingly recovered her memories, she and Pazder consulted with various church authorities, eventually traveling to the Vatican.\n\nPazder was a credentialed psychiatrist and fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, and the book states that its source material (therapy tapes) were scrutinized. However, questions about the accuracy of the allegations in \"Michelle Remembers\" were raised shortly after the book was published. Soon after the book’s publication, Pazder was forced to withdraw his assertion that it was the Church of Satan that had abused Smith when Anton LaVey (who founded the church years after the alleged events of \"Michelle Remembers\") threatened to sue for libel.\n\nIn an October 27, 1980 article in \"Maclean's\", Paul Grescoe interviewed Smith's father, Jack Proby, who denied the allegations against Smith's mother, Virginia (who died in 1964), and claimed he could refute all the allegations in the book. Grescoe also interviewed the mother of a childhood friend of Smith who described Smith’s mother as a kind and charming woman. He also noted that the book failed to make any mention of Smith's two sisters, Charyl (younger) and Tertia (older), or that Pazder and Smith (both Catholics) had divorced their spouses and married each other.\n\nBy 1990, an article in \"The Mail on Sunday\" exposed further inconsistencies in Smith’s allegations. \"The Mail on Sunday\" conducted a two-week investigation into the claims made in \"Michelle Remembers\" and found that other than Pazder and Smith, the people they interviewed described the events in \"Michelle Remembers\" as \"the hysterical ravings of an uncontrolled imagination\". In an interview with Jack Proby, Proby cited (as an example) \"three specific points where … Michelle lied\" in \"Michelle Remembers\". Proby indicated that although he decided not to sue, he did file a Notice of Intent to sue against the book's publisher should they go beyond the literary contract; thereby preventing the book from being made into a movie. \"The Mail on Sunday\" also interviewed the Smith’s childhood family doctor: \"I believe it was … an over-active imagination\"; former neighbors of the Probys: \"I dismissed the book as crazy. The mother was a nice, gracious lady. A little girl could not have been tortured without someone hearing\"; a former childhood friend of Smith: \"Virginia was like a second mother to me. I certainly never had a bad feeling about her\"; and her ex-husband: \"Not once during their marriage or the birth of their daughter did Michelle ever mention her experience\".\n\n\"The Mail on Sunday\" reported that the local Catholic Church and Bishop Remi De Roo were also attempting to distance themselves from the claims in \"Michelle Remembers\": \"He [De Roo] wants to distance himself from these people. More than ten years ago he asked the couple to provide him with details, but they never supplied all the information he required.\" \"The Mail on Sunday\" also reported the Royal Canadian Mounted Police stated that there had never been a single prosecution in Victoria for satanic practices. During the interview, Pazder was questioned about the truth of the claims in the book:\nA 1995 book found further inconsistencies in Smith’s allegations; the authors found no newspaper record of the car crash that the book describes in the time frame described despite the fact that the local newspaper reported on all vehicle accidents at the time. Former neighbors, teachers and friends were interviewed and yearbooks from Smith’s elementary school were reviewed and found no indication of Smith being absent from school or missing for lengthy periods of time, including the alleged 81-day non-stop ceremony. Ultimately the book's authors were unable to find anyone who knew Smith in the 1950s who could corroborate any of the details in her allegations.\n\nA 2002 article by Kerr Cuhulain not only explored the inconsistencies in Smith’s allegations, but also their unlikeliness. Among other things, Cuhulain noted that it seemed unlikely that a sophisticated cult that had secretly existed for generations could be outwitted by a five-year-old; that the cult could hold rituals in the Ross Bay Cemetery unnoticed given that Smith claimed she was screaming and given that the Ross Bay Cemetery is surrounded on three sides by residential neighborhoods; that an 81-day non-stop ceremony involving hundreds of participants and a massive round room could have gone on in Victoria unnoticed; and that none of Smith’s tormentors (other than her mother) have ever been identified, especially given that some of them had cut off one of their middle fingers at the Black Mass. He also notes that during the alleged 81-day ritual, Michelle was confirmed to be attending school, with no remarkable absences and no apparent signs that she was being abused. Like other authors, Cuhulain also noted that many of Smith's recovered memories appear to have reflected elements in popular culture at the time (e.g.: the movie \"The Exorcist\") and Pazder's own religious beliefs and experiences from when he was living and working in Africa in the early 1960s. Finally, Cuhulain hypothesized that Smith's motivation for making the allegations may have come from her desire to spend time with Pazder; though both were initially married to other people, they divorced their spouses and remarried each other after the publication of the book.\n\nJames R. Lewis, in \"The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements\", wrote that \"Michelle Remembers\" \"must be treated with great skepticism, not least because literally all the charges involved seem drawn from accounts of West African secret societies from the 1950s, imported to Canada.\" Nichol Spanos has pointed out in addition to the lack of corroboration of Smith's memories, \"skepticism appears warranted by the fact that some of these \"memories\" involve Michelle's encounters with supernatural beings.\" Spanos also mentions that Smith's father and unmentioned two siblings contradict the allegations made by Smith, as well as Pazder's time in West Africa during a time when there was widespread concern over secret, blood-drinking, cannibalistic cults.\n\nDespite the lack of evidence and inconsistencies surrounding the allegations made in \"Michelle Remembers\", there are still people who believe that Smith’s claims of abuse are the literal truth and that there is a vast, yet secretive worldwide conspiracy of inter-generational satanic worshipers abusing and murdering children and adults.\n\nThe book's contents have been unsubstantiated by any evidence beyond Smith's testimony. Despite this, the book inspired copy-cat accusations throughout the world, against members of the Church of Satan, other occultists, and others with no connection to the occult.\n\nAn appendix reprints the article \"Witchcraft in City' Claim\" by Paul Jeune; the article was referenced by Smith in the book in reference to the alleged black magic practised in Victoria. An evangelist named Len Olsen claimed on televangelist David Mainse's talk show \"100 Huntley Street\" that he and his wife were nearly sacrificed in a satanic ritual by Mark Fedoruk, also known as Lion Serpent Sun. Sun sued for defamation, and in court it was revealed that Olsen had been delusional, apparently due to drug use and guilt; Sun was awarded $10,000 and an appeal was denied. The lawsuit and result were not reported in \"Michelle Remembers,\" only the original false allegations.\n\n\"Michelle Remembers\" was first publicized with articles in \"People\" and the \"National Enquirer\". In 1980, Pazder and Smith toured the United States to promote the book. Ultimately a publishing success, the book earned Pazder and Smith a $100,000 hard-cover advance, $242,000 for paperback rights, royalties, and a potential movie deal.\n\nThe Grescoe article (see Criticism section) did not garner much attention and the allegations in \"Michelle Remembers\" were still considered by many in the early 1980s to be true. As a result, Pazder was considered to be an expert in the area of satanic ritual abuse. With the sudden emergence of satanic ritual abuse cases in the 1980s (likely due in part to the publication of \"Michelle Remembers\") Pazder's expertise was called upon. In 1984, Pazder acted as a consultant in the McMartin preschool trial which featured allegations of satanic ritual abuse. Pazder also appeared on the first major news report on satanism (broadcast on May 16, 1985), by ABC’s \"20/20\". Pazder was part of the Cult Crime Impact Network and lectured to police agencies about satanic ritual abuse during the late 1980s. By 1987 Pazder reported that he was spending a third of his time consulting on satanic ritual abuse cases. By September 1990, Pazder had been consulted \"in more than 1,000 'ritual abuse' cases\". With people suddenly being prosecuted for satanic ritual abuse, prosecutors used the book as a guide when preparing cases against alleged satanists. Prior to the start of the Kern County child abuse cases several local social workers had attended a training seminar that listed satanic ritual abuse as a major element in child sexual abuse and used \"Michelle Remembers\" as training material.\n\n\n"}

The revised version was published by the OHCHR in 2017.\n\nThe original Minnesota Protocol was designed to be a technical document aimed at providing practical assistance to those investigating suspicious deaths. Confronting the question of how to address political killings during the mid-1980s, various civil society groups came to the conclusion that criminal investigation techniques were an obvious starting place. In 1984, Amnesty International carried out its own survey of how various States dealt with autopsies of arbitrary killings. David Weissbrodt, a professor at the University of Minnesota, was spending a sabbatical in the Legal Office of Amnesty International in 1982-3, which was when the idea for a Manual arose.\n\nThe need for some kind of standard was highlighted by the assassination of Benigno Aquino Jr. in August 1983. Despite public declarations of intent, the Government of the Philippines failed to conduct an adequate investigation. However, as Ann Marie Clark has subsequently observed: ‘At that time there were no internationally standardized death investigations procedures. There was no external norm, therefore, that could be used as a basis for criticism when governments failed to implement proper investigation of political killings in a case like the death of Aquino’\n\nUltimately the Protocol was prepared by a group of legal and forensic experts coordinated by the Minnesota International Lawyers Committee for Human Rights (now The Advocates for Human Rights), in collaboration with the Science and Human Rights Program of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\nIn several resolutions, the UN Commission for Human Rights mandated the OHCHR to update the Protocol. These resolutions were later quoted by the Human Rights Council in resolutions on forensic genetics and human rights.\n\nIn 2014 the Special Rapporteur on summary executions, Christof Heyns, began a process of consulting relevant experts and, in collaboration with OHCHR and UNODC, bringing together a large group that would ultimately participate in the revision of the Minnesota Protocol. In 2015, in his report to the General Assembly, he noted that ‘[t]he extent of the continued reliance on the Manual in international jurisprudence and by national legal entities emphasizes the need for the document to be up to date and comprehensive. It is to be expected that if the document is more up to date, it will more often and more readily serve as a guide.’\n\nIn 2016, two Working Groups, and a large international Advisory Panel undertook the revision, including with reference to two stakeholder consultations. As with the original version, the authority of the document relied upon the expertise of these drafting and review groups. Certain individuals had been involved in the processes of drafting both the original and the revised texts. The finalized document was presented to the OHCHR in July 2016, and published in May 2017.\n\nAnnouncing its release, the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights highlighted that ‘Proper investigations into suspicious deaths are an integral part of the protection of the right to life’\n\nRegional human rights courts have referred to the Manual in reaching findings on the inadequacy of investigations into suspicious deaths. National courts have done the same when establishing guidelines for the investigation of killings by the police. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) relied on the Principles and the Manual in its Study on customary international humanitarian law: a contribution to the understanding and respect for the rule of law in armed conflict (2005) and in its Guidelines for Investigating Deaths in Custody (2013).\n\nThe Minnesota Protocol is often grouped with another document with a similar medico-legal and human rights purpose, the Istanbul Protocol, which is aimed at the documentation of torture. In his report to the UN General Assembly in 2014, the Special Rapporteur on torture, Juan E. Méndez, encouraged the use of both documents when performing forensic autopsies, and highlighted capacity gaps in forensic services as contributing to lack of accountability for serious human rights violations.\n\nThe Minnesota Protocol aims to protect the right to life by promoting effective investigation of potentially unlawful death or suspected enforced disappearance. It sets common standards of\nperformance and a shared set of principles and guidelines for States, as well as for institutions and individuals who play a role in investigations.\n\nThe Minnesota Protocol applies to investigations of all “potentially unlawful death”. This primarily includes situations where:\n\n\nThe Protocol makes clear that protecting of the right to life means preventing the arbitrary deprivation of life, but also requires accountability for an arbitrary deprivation of life whenever it occurs. Therefore, in addition to their duties to respect and to protect the right to life, States must also investigate potentially unlawful death, ensure accountability and remedy violations. The Protocol states:The duty to investigate is an essential part of upholding the right to life. […] Where an investigation reveals evidence that a death was caused unlawfully, the State must ensure that identified perpetrators are prosecuted and, where appropriate, punished through a judicial process. […] A failure to respect the duty to investigate is a breach of the right to life. Investigations and prosecutions are essential to deter future violations and to promote accountability, justice, the rights to remedy and to the truth, and the rule of law.\n\nIn addition to its scope, the Protocol also clearly establishes the “trigger” for the State’s duty to investigate, namely where the it knows or should have known of any potentially unlawful death, including where reasonable allegations of a potentially unlawful death are made. As the Protocol details, this includes all cases where the State has caused a death or where it is alleged or suspected that the State caused a death (for example, where law enforcement officers used force that may have contributed to the death) or where the State has failed to exercise due diligence to prevent a death at the hands of a third party. In all cases outside the conduct of hostilities in an armed conflict, this duty exists regardless of whether it is suspected or alleged that the death was unlawful. \n\nThe Protocol offers a particular note on the duty to investigate during the conduct of hostilities, which it highlights as a context that may provide practical difficulties for the application of much of the Protocol’s content. All suspected war crimes must be investigated. But the Protocol also emphasizes that, where, during the conduct of hostilities, it appears that casualties have resulted from an attack, a post-operation assessment should be conducted to establish the facts, including the accuracy of the targeting.\n\nMore broadly, the Protocol also highlights that the State also has a duty to investigate all potentially unlawful death caused by private individuals, even if the State cannot be held responsible for failing to prevent such deaths.\n\nThe Protocol also establishes standards for what it calls the ‘Elements and Principles of Investigations’, broadly that they should be\n\nThe Protocol is explicitly non-prescriptive with respect to investigative mechanisms, noting that the duty to investigate does not necessarily require one particular investigative mechanism in preference to another. States may use a wide range of mechanisms, as determined or suggested by domestic law and practice, as long as those mechanisms meet international law requirements.\n\nThe bulk of the Minnesota Protocol provides first strategies and principles and then detailed guidelines on practical steps that should be taken in an effective investigation. The overarching strategy of any investigation should be methodical and transparent, and all legitimate lines of inquiry should be pursued. An investigation may gather different types of material, not all of which will be used as evidence in a judicial proceeding. But all relevant materials or observations should be secured and logged.\n\nThe Protocol establishes that a set of operational and tactical processes for the investigation should also be designed. These should seek to establish significant facts, preserve relevant material and lead to the identification of all the parties involved, including by managing the following:\n\n\nParticular sections are dedicated to processes for interviewing witnesses and for recovering human remains. The Protocol then provides a great deal of detail attesting both to the importance of, and practical guidance for, the identification of human remains.\n\nParticular guidance is offered on the techniques for collecting and sampling different types of evidence, including the following:\n\n\nInvestigation of potentially unlawful deaths will almost always be aided by the conduct of an autopsy. In a section setting out the general principles of an autopsy the Protocol provides an overview of the duties of a forensic doctor in relation to a death investigation, and then establishes the basic aims of autopsy will assist in fulfilling those duties. The aims of the autopsy, principally are:\n\n\nIn general, the Protocol establishes in various places the requirement of professional ethics for investigators, including forensic doctors. It highlights that any forensic doctor involved in an investigation has responsibilities to justice, to the relatives of the deceased, and more generally to the public. Whether or not they are employed by the police or the State, forensic doctors must understand their obligations to justice (not to the police or the State) and to the relatives of the deceased, so that a true account is provided of the cause of death and the circumstances surrounding it.\n\n\n\n"}

The court unanimously affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeal and dismissed the appeals of several defendants who were convicted on the basis of statements of absent witnesses.\n\nThe case can be viewed as a direct response to the European Court of Human Rights ruling in \"Al-Khawaja v United Kingdom\" (2009) 1 EHRR 49 in which the facts were legally very similar. In this case the ECtHR ruled against the state and found that while it was justifiable to allow hearsay evidence in some circumstances, it was likely never permissible for a conviction to be based solely or decisively on such evidence. Al-Khawaja has been appealed by the United Kingdom and the decision by the Grand Chamber (a larger panel of judges which did not overturn the initial decision) is available. The Lords in Horncastle do not look favourably upon the decision of the Grand Chamber stating \"that although the domestic court was required to take account of the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights in applying principles which were clearly established, where, on rare occasions, the domestic court was concerned that the European court's decision insufficiently appreciated or accommodated particular aspects of the domestic process, it might decline to follow the decision\".\n\nArticle 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights guarantees a fair trial to anybody charged with a criminal offence. As a subset of this general right, accused persons are entitled to benefit from a number of \"minimum rights\", one of which under Article 6(3)(d) is the right to cross-examine prosecution witnesses.\n\nPrevious cases in the European Court of Human Rights such as Lucà v Italy and Kostovski v Netherlands concerned trials in which either the testimony of anonymous witnesses or witness statements made by witnesses who were not called in court were accepted as evidence. The European Court accepted that while allowing this sort of evidence did \"prima facie\" breach a defendants rights under Article 6(3)(d), this was acceptable so long as sufficient counterbalances were present. The court maintained the caveat that although this sort of evidence was normally acceptable, it was never appropriate for a conviction to be based solely or decisively on this sort of untested evidence.\n\nIn Al-Khawaja v United Kingdom (2009) 49 EHRR 1, two applications to the ECtHR were made by men who had been convicted on criminal charges on the basis of untested hearsay statements. In one case a defendant was convicted of indecent assault on the basis of the statement of a woman who had subsequently committed suicide, in the other a defendant was convicted of wounding with intent (contrary to section 18 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861) on the basis of a statement made by the victim, who had been unwilling to testify in court. The ECtHR found that in both cases the state was in breach of Article 6 by allowing convictions to be based \"solely or decisively\" on hearsay evidence.\n\nTwo of the Appellants had been convicted of committing grievous bodily harm with intent. Their convictions were based \"to a decisive extent\" on a statement made by the victim of the alleged offence, who had later died (the cause of his death was \"not attributable to the injuries\" he suffered). The other appellants were convicted of kidnapping, in this case their conviction was found to have been based \"to a decisive extent\" on a statement made by the victim who had not attended the trial due to fear.\n\nUnder the Criminal Justice Act 2003, it was permissible for the trial judges in each case to allow this evidence to be presented in this way. The Act provided for a general presumption that hearsay evidence should not be allowed in criminal trials but this presumption could be defeated when witnesses were unavailable due to one of a number of prescribed reasons (including the witness having died before the trial under section 116(2)(a) or the witness being unavailable for trial due to fear under section 116(2)(e).\n\nThe Act also provided a number of safeguards and exceptions which allowed judges to exclude unsafe or unfair hearsay evidence, permitted opposing counsel additional grounds to attack the credibility of absent witnesses and gave the judge a discretionary power to stop the case if the prosecution's case was based to any extent on hearsay evidence and was not convincing. The Act did not make any mention of the evidence of absent witnesses which was the \"sole or decisive\" basis of a conviction, (although this rule is one of the criteria which must be considered by a judge when determining if a witness should be allowed anonymity).\n\nIn the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) an augmented panel of five judges unanimously affirmed the convictions of the appellants, declining to follow the \"sole or decisive\" rule found in the ECtHR cases and expressing support for the code of statutory provisions on hearsay contained within sections 114 to 136 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. Their reasons were often similar to those in the Supreme Court, and in his judgment Lord Phillips expressed approval of the Court of Appeal's reasoning and stated that the two rulings were best read as a whole.\n\nArguments were made in the House of Lords between the 7 and 9 July 2009. Senior Counsel were Tim Owen QC and Shaun Smith QC for the two sets of appellants and David Perry QC for the Crown in response. An extended panel of 7 Justices heard the case, which is common practice when a case raises important human rights issues.\n\nOn 9 December 2009, the Court ruled unanimously in favour of the crown and dismissed the appeals. The Court's President Lord Phillips gave the leading judgment, with which the rest of the court agreed, although Lord Brown added some brief comments and Lord Mance prepared an annex detailing the history of similar cases in the ECtHR.\n\nThe court began by asserting that it was not bound by the ECtHR precedent. It confirmed that under section 2 of the Human Rights Act 1998 it was required to \"take into account\" Strasbourg cases and this meant that on rare occasions, they did not need to be followed.\n\nLord Phillips then set out his reasons for dismissing the appeal. His reasoning centred around the ECtHR's perceived failure to accommodate UK law, both in terms of a failure to appreciate the strengths of the common law tradition with regard to criminal evidence and those of the current law which \"render the sole or decisive rule unnecessary\".\n\nThe court felt that it was significant that UK law had long incorporated safeguards against untested, hearsay evidence and this had ensured that the rights encompassed by article 6(3)(d) had long been protected by English law. The system in the UK was compared to that of France at the time of the Convention's creation. In this system, and other continental criminal procedures, a formal inquisitorial process was conducted by a judge before the trial itself, which lacked, according to Lord Phillips, many of the constituent rights attached to the concept of a fair trial, for example a lack of rules of evidence and the interrogation of witnesses in the absence of the defendant. It was suggested that the purpose of the rights codified in article 6 was to prevent this type of conduct, and was not designed to have a major effect on common law systems.\n\nThe current statutory regime enacted by the Criminal Justice Act 2003 was also praised as a \"crafted code\" which ensured that hearsay evidence was properly admitted. It was noted that the current system was heavily influenced by the Law Commission and by consultation with experts. It was suggested that to introduce the \"sole or decisive rule\" without discussion or consideration would damage this code.\n\nThe court also noted that the rule would create practical difficulties in the criminal system, and that it was virtually always the case that UK law did exclude evidence that fell within the \"sole or decisive rule\".\n\nAnother observation made was that the rule is paradoxical; it results in spurious or weak hearsay evidence which would not result in a conviction alone being admitted, while stronger, damning evidence which is likely to achieve a conviction even in the absence of further evidence being excluded. It was suggested that this approach did not make sense, and that good systems tend to exclude weak, not strong evidence.\n\n"}
{"id": "54705603", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54705603", "title": "Rape in Islamic law", "text": "Rape in Islamic law\n\nIn Islam, human sexuality is governed by God's law. Accordingly, sexual violation is regarded as a violation of moral and divine law. Islam divided claims of sexual violation into 'divine rights' (\"huquq Allah\") and 'interpersonal rights' (\"huquq al-'ibad\"): the former requiring divine punishment (\"hadd\" penalties) and the latter belonging to the more flexible human realm.\n\nRape is considered a serious sexual crime in Islam. Classical Islamic law (\"Shari'a\") regarded the crime of sexual violation as a coercive zina, and therefore a hadd offence.\n\nRape is considered a serious sexual crime in Islam, and can be defined in Islamic law as: \"Forcible illegal sexual intercourse by a man with a woman who is not legally married to him, without her free will and consent\".\n\nIslamic law, like the legal systems of classical antiquity and the ancient Near East, does not contain a true equivalent of the modern concept of rape, which is in turn based on the modern notions of individual autonomy and inviolability of the body, particularly the female body. In modern terms, rape is at its most basic level a violation of another person's sexual autonomy. In the communally and patriarchically oriented societies of Late Antiquity, a woman's sexuality was construed as something in control of her legal guardian or owner rather than in her individual control. Therefore, the category of coercive sexual violation was not clearly differentiated from other categories such as consensual violation of sexual norms (seduction). \n\nThe terms \"ghasaba\" and \"ightasaba\" have been used by traditional jurists when discussing sexual assault and its punishment. Most jurists hold that rape is committing zinā by force, hence rape is known as \"zinā bī al-ikrāh\" (). Al-Shāfi‘ī defined rape as: \"Forcing a woman to commit zinā against her will\". To the Ḥanafis, illegal intercourse is considered rape when there is no consent and no deliberate action from the victim. In Mālik’s view, rape refers to any kind of unlawful sexual intercourse (zinā) by usurpation and without consent. This includes instances when the condition of the victims prevents them from expressing their resistance, such as insanity, sleep or being under age. The Ḥanbalites, similar to the Mālikites, consider the use of any kind of force as a denial of consent from the victim. The threat of starvation or suffering the cold of winter are also regarded as against one's will.\n\nClassical Islamic law defined what today is commonly called \"rape\" as a coercive form of fornication or adultery (\"zināʾ\"). This basic definition of rape as \"coercive \"zināʾ\"\" meant that all the normal legal principles that pertained to \"zināʾ\"its definition, punishment and establishment through evidencewere also applicable to rape; the prototypical act of \"zināʾ\" was defined as sexual intercourse between a man and a woman over whom the man has neither a conjugal nor an ownership right. What distinguished a prototypical act of zināʾ from an act of rape, for the jurists, was that in the prototypical case, both parties act out of their own volition, while in an act of rape, only one of the parties does so. Jurists admitted a wide array of situations as being \"coercive\" in nature, including the application of physical force, the presence of duress, or the threat of future harm either to oneself or those close to oneself; they also included in their definition of \"coercion\" the inability to give valid consent, as in the case of minors, or mentally ill or unconscious persons. Muslim jurists from the earliest period of Islamic law agreed that perpetrators of coercive \"zināʾ\" should receive the \"ḥadd\" punishment normally applicable to their personal status and sexual status, but that the ḥadd punishment should not be applied to victims of coercive or nonconsensual \"zināʾ\" due to their reduced capacity.\n\nThe crime of rape, according to Sunni Ḥanafī and Mālikī jurists, is as an act of zinā. If the consent was granted under coercion or in a defective legal capacity such as by a mentally impaired person, it is considered non-consent or invalid consent.\n\nAccording to Georgetown University professor Jonathan A.C. Brown, Islamic law has historically handled marital rape differently from modern laws, which originated in the 1970s. Sexual abuse within marriage was conceptualized as harm inflicted on the wife rather than violation of consent. Historical record shows that women were able to go to court and force their husbands to desist and pay damages in such cases.\n\nRape is punishable in some circumstances by the ḥadd of zinā as well as in some circumstances by the ḥadd of ḥirābah and it is also complemented by ta‘zīr.\n\nMost classical scholars argued for applying the ḥadd penalty for zinā to a convicted rapist, which is stoning to death for the married (\"muḥsān\"), or a flogging of 100 lashes and deportation for the unmarried (\"ghair-muḥsān\"). They base their argument on a hadith which reports a rape case at the time of the Prophet, where the victim was excused and her rapist (who was married) was sentenced to be stoned to death.\n\nCertain classical jurists (Al-Tabari and the Maliki Ibn al-'Arabi) and more modern interpretations (The Religious Council of Egypt among others) have classified the crime of rape not as a subcategory of zinā, but rather a separate crime of violence under \"hirabah\" (forcible and violent taking), i.e. a violent crime causing disorder in the land in the manner described in the Qur'an (5:33) as \"fasad\" (destructive mischief). A similar crime, for example, would be highway robbery, as it puts fear in people going out or losing their property through violence. Thus, the rapist will be considered to be under the category of people who are outlaws and a danger towards the peace and security of the society.\n\nSome modern researchers maintain that offenders be allotted a \"ta'zir\" penalty upon the discretion of the authorities. To them, rape deserves a ta‘zīr penalty when a conviction is reached as a result of circumstantial evidence, such as marks of violence about the genitals, marks of violence on the body of the victim or accused, the presence of semen or blood-stains on the body or clothes of the victim or accused, or a medical report, all of which are sufficient for ta‘zīr only. Under the principle of \"al-fi‘l al-darr\" (Islamic law of Tort), it is possible for a victim to make a claim for moral damages, which may include violation of a person’s freedom, dignity, reputation, social or financial status.\n\nAccording to the Mālikī, Ḥanbalī, and Shāfiʾī schools of law, the rape of a free woman consisted of not one but two violations: a violation against a \"right of God\" (\"ḥaqq Allāh\"), provoking the \"ḥadd\" punishment; and a violation against a \"human\" (interpersonal) right (\"ḥaqq ādamī\"), requiring a monetary compensation. These jurists saw the free woman, in her proprietorship over her own sexuality (\"buḍʾ\"), as not unlike the slave-owner who owns the sexuality of his female slave. For them, in the same way that the slave owner was entitled to compensation for sexual misappropriation, the free woman was also entitled to compensation. The amount of this compensation, they reasoned, should be the amount that any man would normally pay for sexual access to the woman in questionthat is, the amount of her dower (\"ṣadāq\" or \"mahr\").\n\nIf a woman claims to have been raped or sexually abused under duress, she will be acquitted of adultery in light of Qur'anic verse 24:33, which states that a woman has not sinned when compelled to commit this crime.\n\nAccording to Professor Oliver Leaman, the required testimony of four male witnesses having seen the actual penetration applies to illicit sexual relations (i.e. adultery and fornication), not to rape. The requirements for proof of rape are less stringent:\n\nRape charges can be brought and a case proven based on the sole testimony of the victim, providing that circumstantial evidence supports the allegations. It is these strict criteria of proof which lead to the frequent observation that where injustice against women does occur, it is not because of Islamic law. It happens either due to misinterpretation of the intricacies of the Sharia laws governing these matters, or cultural traditions; or due to corruption and blatant disregard of the law, or indeed some combination of these phenomena.\n\nAs far as abortion in the context of rape, most jurist do not consider rape to be a valid reason: the sanctity of the new life takes precedence over the autonomy of the pregnant women.\n\nMuslim scholars have held that the child of rape is a legitimate child and thus it would be sinful to kill this child. Scholars permit its abortion only if the fetus is less than four months old, or if it endangers the life of its mother.\n\nMuslim scholars were urged to make exceptions in the 1990s following rapes of Kuwaiti women by Iraqi soldiers (in 1991) and the rape of Bosnian and Albanian women by Serb soldiers. In 1991, the Grand Mufti of Palestine, Ekrima Sa'id Sabri took a different position than mainstream Muslim scholars. He ruled that Muslim women raped by their enemies during the Kosovo War could take abortifacient medicine, because otherwise the children born to those women might one day fight against Muslims.\n"}

Swine were prohibited in ancient Syria and Phoenicia, and the pig and its flesh represented a taboo observed, Strabo noted, at Comana in Pontus. A lost poem of Hermesianax, reported centuries later by the traveller Pausanias, reported an etiological myth of Attis destroyed by a supernatural boar to account for the fact that \"in consequence of these events the Galatians who inhabit Pessinous do not touch pork\". Concerning Abrahamic religions, clear restrictions exist in Jewish dietary laws (Kashrut) and in Islamic dietary laws (Halal).\n\nAlthough Christianity is also an Abrahamic religion, most of its adherents are permitted to consume pork – justified by Peter's vision of a sheet with animals and several verses of the New Testament which guides Christians with the Good News of the Gospels. Since Christianity lost most of its roots from Judaism, Christians are not bound to some restrictions of Mosaic Law. However, Seventh-day Adventists consider pork taboo, along with other foods forbidden by Jewish law. The Eritrean Orthodox Church and the Ethiopian Orthodox Church do not permit pork consumption.\nAccording to Dr. Clovis Karam in his trilogy on the Phoenician Religion, Symbols and Anthropology, the pork taboo mystery most likely is locked into the story of the death of Adonis the God of vegetation and Tammuz Doumuzi who was slain by a wild boar. Tammuz Adonis the gardener par excellence of the Garden of Adon (falsely translated to the Garden of Eden) feast was celebrated during the Adoni in the whole Mediterranean by commemorating the \" les jardins d'Adonis\". Hence the meaning behind the naming in our Fertile Crescent calendar of : Hzeiran \"hzyro=pig, the month of heat \"June\" that kills Tammuz-Adonai \" July\" the gardener par excellence.\n\nThe Torah (Pentateuch) contains passages in Leviticus that lists the animals people are permitted to consume. It first notes what qualifies an animal that is absolutely permitted:\n\nAnimals that have cloven hooves and chew their cud are ruminants such as cows, sheep, and deer. This text does not specify every possible animal by name, only their behaviors. \n\nThe text goes on to describe specific animals that are known and meet one, but not both, of those qualifications, thereby prohibiting their consumption. It does not elaborate on the exact reason for prohibition other than physical characteristics. \n\nPigs are described in this section as prohibited because they have a cloven hoof but don't chew their cud.\n\nDeuteronomy expands on the list of permitted animals.\n\nDeuteronomy reiterates what Leviticus states on pigs.\n\nOne example of verses from the Quran on pig consumption:\n\nThe prohibition of certain food is also linked to Islamic Cosmology. Accordingly \"good\" and \"evil\" qualities are transferred by eating an object carrying a certain quality, that also affects the soul of human, the pig rendered with \"evil qualities\".\n\nScottish pork taboo was Donald Alexander Mackenzie's phrase for discussing an aversion to pork among Scots, particularly Highlanders, which he believed stemmed from an ancient taboo. Several writers who confirm that there was a prejudice against pork, or a superstitious attitude toward pigs, do not see it in terms of a taboo related to an ancient cult. Any prejudice is generally agreed to have disappeared by 1800.\n\nThe cultural materialistic anthropologist Marvin Harris thinks that the main reason for prohibiting consumption of pork was ecological-economical. Pigs require water and shady woods with seeds, but those conditions are scarce in the Middle East. Unlike many other forms of livestock, pigs are omnivorous scavengers, eating virtually anything they come across, including carrion and refuse. This was deemed unclean; and a Middle Eastern society keeping large stocks of pigs would destroy their ecosystem. \n\nExtrapolating all of this into a modern scientific context, one could surmise that the very close relationship between humans and pigs also makes them undesirable as food.\n\nIt is speculated that chickens supplanted pigs as a more portable and efficient source of protein, leading to the religious restrictions.\n\nMaimonides, the Jewish philosopher and legal codifier, who was also court physician to the Muslim sultan Saladin in the 12th century, understands the dietary laws chiefly as a means of keeping the body healthy. He argued that the meat of the forbidden animals, birds, and fish is unwholesome and indigestible. According to Maimonides, at first glance, this does not apply to pork, which does not appear to be harmful. Yet, Maimonides observes, the pig is a filthy animal and if swine were used for food, marketplaces and even houses would be dirtier than latrines.\n\nRashi (the primary Jewish commentator on the Bible and Talmud) lists the prohibition of pig as a law whose reason is not known, and may therefore be derided by others as making no sense.\n\nThe Chinuch Sefer HaChinuch (an early work of Halachah) gives a general overview of the Jewish dietary laws. He writes \"And if there are any reasons for the dietary laws which are unknown to us or those knowledgeable in the health field, do not wonder about them, for the true Healer that warns us against them is smarter than us, and smarter than the doctors\".\n\n\n"}

Fish and Game Comm'n, 334 U.S. 410 (1948), was a case before the United States Supreme Court. The issue at hand was a restrictive law in California requiring American citizenship to get a fishing license. The Court held that this was an unreasonable restriction and was discriminatory to residents of Japanese ancestry.\n\nTorao Takahashi came from Japan to the United States and became a resident of Terminal Island in Los Angeles County, California in 1907. Prior to 1943 California issued commercial fishing licenses to all qualified persons without regard to alienage or ineligibility to citizenship. From 1915 to 1942 Takahashi, under annual commercial fishing licenses issued by the State, fished in ocean waters off the California coast, apparently both within and without the three-mile coastal belt, and brought his fresh fish ashore for sale. In 1942, while the United States country was at war with Japan, Takahashi and other California residents of Japanese ancestry were forcibly interned under military orders. The evacuation was legally challenged in \"Korematsu v. United States\" but a majority of the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the evacuation.\n\nIn 1943, during the period of war and evacuation, an amendment to the California Fish and Game Code was adopted prohibiting issuance of a license to any \"alien Japanese.\" In 1945, the state code was again amended by striking the 1943 provision for fear that it might be \"declared unconstitutional\" because directed only \"against alien Japanese\"; the new amendment banned issuance of licenses to any \"person ineligible to citizenship,\" which classification included Japanese. Cal. Stats. 1945, ch. 181. Because of this state provision barring issuance of commercial fishing licenses to persons ineligible for citizenship under federal law, Takahashi, who met all other state requirements, was denied a license by the California Fish and Game Commission upon his return to California in 1945.\n\nTakahashi, an alien ineligible for citizenship, brought an action for mandamus in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California, to compel the Commission to issue him a commercial fishing license.\n\nThe Superior Court first ordered issuance of a commercial fishing license authorizing Takahashi to bring ashore \"catches of fish from the waters of the high seas beyond the State's territorial jurisdiction.\"\n\nAfter appeal to the State Supreme Court by the State Commission the Superior Court amended its judgment so as to order a commercial license authorizing Takahashi to bring in catches of fish taken from the three-mile ocean belt adjacent to the California coast as well as from the high seas. It held that lawful alien inhabitants of California, despite their ineligibility to citizenship, were entitled to engage in the vocation of commercial fishing on the high seas beyond the three-mile belt on the same terms as other lawful state inhabitants, and that the California code provision denying them this right violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nA judgment granting the writ was reversed by the State Supreme Court, three judges dissenting.\n\nThe Court held that California had a proprietary interest in fish in the ocean waters within three miles of the shore, and that this interest justified the State in barring all aliens in general and aliens ineligible to citizenship in particular from catching fish within or without the three-mile coastal belt and bringing them to California for commercial purposes. 30 Cal. 2d 719, 185 P. 2d 805.\n\nThe state court held that this interest justified the state in barring all aliens in general, and aliens ineligible for citizenship in particular, from catching fish within or without the three-mile coastal belt and bringing them into the state for commercial purposes.\n\nThe Supreme Court granted certiorari. 333 U.S. 853, \"to review this question of importance in the fields of federal-state relationships and of constitutionally protected individual equality and liberty\".\n\nThe Court reversed. Justice Black was joined by six other justices.\n\nIt held that the California statute forbidding the issuance of commercial fishing licenses to aliens ineligible to citizenship was held to violate the constitutional right of such aliens to the equal protection of the laws. The contention that the statute might be supported as a conservation measure was rejected. The state could not, consistent with the United States Constitution, use federally created racial ineligibility for citizenship as a basis for barring petitioner from earning his living as a commercial fisherman in the ocean water off the state coast. The refusal to issue petitioner a commercial fishing license violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and there was no special public interest to support the state ban on petitioner's commercial fishing.\n\nA state prohibition of the issuance of commercial fishing licenses to persons ineligible to citizenship makes an unreasonable classification in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (distinguishing \"Terrace v. Thompson\", 263 US 197; \"Porterfield v. Webb\", 263 US 225; \"Webb v. O'Brien\", 263 US 313; and \"Frick v. Webb\", 263 US 326).\n\n1. A California statute barring issuance of commercial fishing licenses to persons \"ineligible to citizenship,\" which classification included resident alien Japanese and precluded such a one from earning his living as a commercial fisherman in the ocean waters off the coast of the State, held invalid under the Federal Constitution and laws. pp. 412–422.\n\n2. For purposes of decision by this Court, it may be assumed that the object of the statute was to conserve fish in the coastal waters of the State, or to protect citizens of the State engaged in commercial fishing from the competition of Japanese aliens, or both. P. 418.\n\n3. That the United States regulates immigration and naturalization in part on the basis of race and color classifications does not authorize adoption by a State of such classifications to prevent lawfully admitted aliens within its borders from earning a livelihood by means open to all other inhabitants. pp. 418–420.\n\n4. The Fourteenth Amendment and federal laws, 8 U. S. C. § 41, embody a general policy that all persons lawfully in this country shall abide \"in any state\" on an equality of legal privileges with all citizens under non-discriminatory laws. pp. 419–420.\n\n5. Whatever may be the interest of the State or its citizens in the fish in the 3-mile belt offshore, that interest does not justify the State in excluding any or all aliens who are lawful residents of the State from making a living by fishing in the ocean off its shores while permitting all other persons to do so. pp. 420–421.\n\n6. Assuming their continued validity, cases sustaining state laws barring land ownership by aliens ineligible to citizenship, which rested on grounds peculiar to real property, can not be extended to control the decision in this case. P. 422.\n\nJustice Murphy, joined by Rutledge, expressed agreement with these views, but thought that the statute should also be condemned as being the direct outgrowth of antagonism toward persons of Japanese ancestry and as having no relation whatever to any constitutionally cognizable interest of California.\n\nJustice Reed, joined by Jackson, dissented on the ground that a state has the power to exclude all aliens from enjoyment of its natural resources, including its fisheries, and that a classification excluding such aliens as are ineligible to citizenship is not unreasonable.\n\n"}

It is a well known and regulated international finance centre and has been a popular jurisdiction for European offshore companies. The financial sector, tourism, shipping services fees, and duties on consumer goods generate revenue.\n\nThe law of Gibraltar is based on English law, but is separate from the UK legal system. Non-resident businesses do not pay income tax unless the source of this income is Gibraltar proper. There is no tax on capital income.\n\nIn Gibraltar there is no capital gains tax, wealth tax, sales tax or value added tax. Import duty is payable on most items at 12% The main tax for companies is Corporation Tax, and Social insurance contributions. There are also stamp duties on certain transactions, and property taxes ('rates').\n\nNon-resident companies can take advantage of a number of offshore regimes in order to reduce taxation, although in line with the elimination of unfair tax practices this is being phased out. Individuals pay quite high taxes on their income in Gibraltar unless they are able to take advantage of high-net-worth individual status or gain exemption as an expatriate executive. Import duties are quite high on some items.\n\nAssessment and collection of tax is administered by the Commissioner of Income Tax; the tax year runs from 1st July to the following 30 June.\n\nThe information in this article is taken from the publication \"Gibraltar Tax facts\". It may be incorrect or out of date. For the latest data see the Government of Gibraltar website listed in external links.\n\nGibraltar is a VAT free jurisdiction.\n\nLevied at the rate of 1% of relevant income (gaming yield for online casinos and bets placed for online bookmakers), capped at £425,000 with a minimum payable of £85,000.\n\nImport duties are levied on goods imported into Gibraltar, mostly at rates 0% - 12%. As of 1 July 2010, import duty on pedal cycles, electric cars, solar paneling and related equipment has been reduced to 0%. Import duty on hybrid cars has similarly been reduced, though it has increased for petrol and diesel powered vehicles.\n\nLevied mainly on spirits, wines, tobacco and mineral oils.\n\nMinimums and maxima shown are per week.\nNo contributions are payable if the person is not in receipt of earnings.\nIncome earned by a student on holiday is exempt.\n\nBefore 2009, the rate of corporation tax was 22%. With effect from 1 July 2009, regarding any new businesses, a start up rate of 10% will apply to any business established in Gibraltar after 1 July 2009. Tax will be assessed on an actual year basis. With effect from 1 January 2011, a new rate of 10% will apply to all companies except energy and utility providers, which will pay a 10% surcharge and thus incur a rate of 20%. These will include electricity, fuel, telephone service and water providers.\n\nAs an anti-avoidance provision, it will not apply in respect of any commercial activity being carried out before 25 June 2009 and that is reorganized by the taxpayer in the name of a different entity for the purpose of benefiting from the scheme.\n\nIn addition, no tax is payable on dividends between Gibraltar companies\n\n\nGibraltar has two tax systems, one based on gross income which does not provide any allowances, and another with different rates which does. The choice of which system to apply is made by the taxable person.\n\n1. Persons on gross income up to £16,000\n\n2. Persons on gross income £16,000 to £25,000\n\n3. Persons on gross income between £25,001 and £35,000\n\nA rate of 20% applies less tapering relief on gross income between £25,001 and £26,000. With the tapering relief on gross income of £25,000, there is a tax-free amount of £2000 that reduces by £2 for every £1 increase in gross income.\n\n4. Persons on gross income between £35,001 and £100,000\n\nThe effective (average) tax rate is reduced by 0.5% from the previous year using a complex formula to give a maximum effective tax rate of 26.25% on gross income of £100,000. The tax liability is arrived at by first calculating using the previous year’s tax band (i.e. 20% for tax bands of £0 - £25,000 and 29% for £25,001 - £100,000), then reducing it by 0.5% and finally applying the resulting rate of taxable income (gross income less tapering relief). With the tapering relief on gross income of £35,001, there is a tax-free amount of £3284 that reduces by £2 for every £1 increase in gross income.\n\n5. Persons on gross income between £100,001 and £353,000\n\nA rate of 20% on the first £25,000 of gross income applies, with the balance taxed at 29%.

The tax is determined by the Net tonnage of the entire fleet of vessels under operation or use by a company. It is on the basis of this variable that taxation is applied. \nGiven that the tax perceived is independent from the volume of material transported and from the operating profit of a shipping company, it is less complex to manage for tax authorities and shipping companies. This method of taxation is based on an objectively measurable variable - net tonnage - by independent certifying bodies that determine the transport capacity of the vessels. Under current international practice, tonnage tax regimes are used to incentivise the modernisation and improved environmental performance of merchant fleets. \nThe first country to introduce a tonnage tax was Greece back in 1957. Today, tonnage tax rules are applied in many countries, including 18 EU countries. The latest tonnage tax regime to have received the approval of the European Commission is the Maltese tonnage tax scheme on 19 December 2017.\n"}

In 2004, it was a revision of the Directive 2001/34/EC. The Transparency Directive was amended in 2013 by the Transparency Directive Amending Directive (Directive 2013/50/EU).\n\nThe Transparency Directive improves the harmonisation of information duties of issuers, whose securities are listed at a regulated market at a stock exchange within the European Union, and further market participants. The aims of these amendments are to establish minimum requirements regarding the financial information distribution all over the European Union and an increase in transparency at the capital markets and in investor protection to meet information deficits in a developing financial market environment.\n\nThe process, which resulted in the 2004 version of the EU Transparency Directive, passed several years, consultations and revisions.\nThe first step towards the EU Transparency Directive of 2004 took place in July 2001 when the Commission of the European Union announced the first consultation regarding the transparency on publicly traded companies. This first consultation period lasted from 17 July 2001 until 30 September 2001. During that time interested parties were able to contribute comments on the proposals, which the Commission drafted in its own consultation paper, regarding the new regime on disclosure requirements. Interested parties could be the issuers themselves, national agencies and associations, state authorities and European authorities, such as CESR. The consultation paper of the Commission suggested a division of disclosure duties, in periodic and ongoing obligations, for example for financial reports (periodical) and ad hoc notifications (ongoing), and a focus on the publications of those information through a medium on a Europe-wide basis as well as the control of these duties by the national supervisory authorities. Until the end of the consultation period the Commission received 90 contributions from market participants all over Europe, whereas most of the answers came from British and German interest groups. Mostly these answers complied with the suggestions, which were made up by the Commission.\n\nHowever there have also been some amendments:\n\nAfter the first consultation the Commission revised its consultation paper to present it to the public another time. In May 2002 the Commission launched a second and final consultation period, which lasted from 8 May 2002 until 5 July 2002. The Commission specified the information requirements regarding issuers, listed in a regulated market at a stock exchange, especially in terms of financial reporting, voting rights, directors’ dealing, stock options, employee shares schemes and equal treatment of shareholders.\n\nIn detail, those suggestions were:\n\nThese suggestions were basically confirmed by the interested parties.\n\nOn 26 May 2003 the Commission proposed its draft for the Directive to the European Parliament and to the Council of the European Union. About one year later, on 30 March 2004, the European Parliament approved the Directive, whereby the unofficial version of the Directive was published on 11 May 2004. This unofficial version covered all of the topics discussed in the former consultation process, such as periodical financial reporting, transparency in shareholder structure and publication of information.\n\nThe final version of the Directive 2004/109/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the harmonisation of transparency requirements in relation to information about issuers whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market was adopted on 17 December 2004. After the announcement of the Directive in the Official Journal of the European Union the Member State should transform the regulations, agreed on in the Directive, into national law within the next two years, not later that 20 January 2007.\n\nThe Transparency Directive was amended in 2013 by the Transparency Directive Amending Directive (TDAD), Directive 2013/50/EU. The final date for member states to implement the TDAD was 26 November 2015.\nThe TDAD contains these elements:\n\nThe Directive specifies a range of regulations which have to be transformed into national law by the Member State, whereas the Directive only sets minimum standards. Member State have the possibility to set up stricter rules.\n\nThis Directive is directed to issuers whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market situated or operating within a Member State and regulates requirements regarding the disclosure of periodic and ongoing information.\n\nThe Directive defines several terms, which are used in the new regulations, either by referring to other Directives or by its own definition.\n\nThe issuer has to publish its annual financial report not later than four months after the end of the fiscal year and has to ensure that this report is accessible for at least five years. The annual financial report has to include the audited financial statements, a management report and a statement by officials that the financial statements were set up in compliance with the applicable accounting standards. In addition to the annual financial report the audit report should be published, as well.\n\nThe issuer has to publish a financial report covering the first half of the fiscal year after the end of this relevant period. This report has to include the financial statements for the first half of the fiscal year, an interim management report (including major events in the first half-year, a forecast for the next half-year and their possible impacts and further financial statements) and a statement by officials that the financial statements were set up in compliance with the applicable accounting standards. In case this half-yearly report gets audited, the audit report has to be published as well.\n\nA shareholder, acquiring or selling shares, has to notify the issuer of such transactions, as soon as the acquisition or disposal of shares results in an amount of voting rights, that exceeds, falls below or reaches the threshold of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 50% and 75% of the total amount of voting rights issued.\n\nThis notification requirement can also be based on the following cases:\n\nThis notification has to include the amount of voting rights held after acquisition/disposal, the day on which the event took place, the chain of controlled undertakings or the name of the (directly invested) shareholder from which the notifying party gets attributed the voting rights.\nFurthermore a notification is required when a natural person or legal entity holds financial instruments, which result in the entitlement to acquire voting rights, whereas the acquisition is based on the holder's initiative.\nThese regulations should not apply for shareholders, holding the shares as market makers, for clearing and settlement purposes and credit institutions, holding the shares in their trading book, and holding less than 10% of the total amount of voting rights issued.\n\nIssuers are obliged to treat those shareholders equally, which are in the same position. Furthermore issuers have to make all available all kinds of information that are necessary for the shareholders to ensure the exercise of their rights. \nperson to exercise their voting and/or financial rights, either in paper or electronic form. After the annual general meeting the issuer has to publish decisions made at the annual general meeting, if applicable, which are: payment of dividends and issue of new shares, including allotment-, subscription-, cancellation- and conversion rights of the new shares.\n\nAs long as shareholders or issuers have to provide information to each other, e.g. disclose the holding of voting rights, this information has to be filed with the state authority at the same time as well. The same applies for issuers, who propose the annual meeting to change their articles of incorporation.\n\nEach Member State of the European Union has to designate a state authority, which should be responsible for carrying out the obligations regarding shareholders and issuers. Therefore the Member States have to empower the authorities to achieve the aims of the Directive. Especially the authorities should be able to require involved parties to provide them with information and documents regarding each single case or require the issuers and shareholder to disclose such information, which is necessary to fulfill their requirements. Additionally the authorities shall be empowered to carry out on-site inspection, to verify compliance with the statutory requirements.\n\n"}

He is best known as the founder, primary musician, and principal songwriter of the industrial rock project Nine Inch Nails, which he founded in 1988 and of which he was the sole official member until adding long-time collaborator Atticus Ross as a permanent member in 2016. His first release under the Nine Inch Nails name, the 1989 album \"Pretty Hate Machine\", was a commercial and critical success. He has since released eight Nine Inch Nails studio albums. He left Interscope Records in 2007 and was an independent recording artist until signing with Columbia Records in 2012.\n\nReznor was associated with the bands Option 30, The Urge, The Innocent, and Exotic Birds in the mid-1980s. Outside of Nine Inch Nails, he has contributed to the albums of artists such as Marilyn Manson and Saul Williams. He and his wife, Mariqueen Maandig, are members of the post-industrial group How to Destroy Angels, with Atticus Ross and long-time Nine Inch Nails graphic designer Rob Sheridan.\n\nReznor and Ross scored the David Fincher films \"The Social Network\" (2010), \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" (2011), and \"Gone Girl\" (2014), winning the Academy Award for Best Original Score for \"The Social Network\" and the Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media for \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\". In 1997, Reznor appeared in \"Time\" list of the year's most influential people, and \"Spin\" magazine described him as \"the most vital artist in music\".\n\nMichael Trent Reznor was born on May 17, 1965 in New Castle, Pennsylvania, the son of Nancy Lou (\"née\" Clark) and Michael Reznor. He has German and Irish ancestry, and is a descendant of businessman George Reznor, who founded the heating and air conditioning manufacturer The Reznor Company in 1888 (the business was sold in the 1960s). Reznor grew up in Mercer, Pennsylvania. After his parents divorced, he lived with his maternal grandparents from the age of six, while his sister Tera lived with their mother. He began playing the piano at the age of 12 and showed an early aptitude for music. His grandfather, Bill Clark, told \"People\" magazine in February 1995 that Reznor was \"a good kid ... a Boy Scout who loved to skateboard, build model planes, and play the piano\". He stated, \"Music was his life, from the time he was a wee boy. He was so gifted.\" His former piano teacher, Rita Beglin, said that he \"always reminded [her] of Harry Connick, Jr. when he played\".\n\nReznor has acknowledged that his sheltered life left him feeling isolated from the outside world. In a September 1994 interview with \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, he referred to his choices in the music industry:\n\nHowever, in April 1995, Reznor told \"Details\" magazine that he did not \"want to give the impression it was a miserable childhood\". At Mercer Area Junior/Senior High School, he learned to play the tenor saxophone and tuba, and was a member of both the jazz and marching band. The school's former band director remembered him as \"very upbeat and friendly\". Reznor also became involved in theater while in high school, and was voted \"Best in Drama\" by classmates for his roles as Judas in \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" and Professor Harold Hill in \"The Music Man\". He graduated in 1983 and enrolled at Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania, where he studied computer engineering.\n\nWhile he was a student at Mercer Area Junior/Senior High School, Reznor joined local band Option 30 and played three shows a week with them. After a year of college, Reznor dropped out and moved to Cleveland, Ohio, to pursue a career in music. His first band in Cleveland was the Urge, a cover band. In 1985, he joined The Innocent as a keyboardist; they released one album, \"Livin' in the Street\", but Reznor left the band after three months. In 1986, he joined local band Exotic Birds and appeared with them as a fictional band called The Problems in the 1987 film \"Light of Day\". Reznor also contributed on keyboards to the band Slam Bamboo during this time.\n\nReznor got a job at Cleveland's Right Track Studio as an assistant engineer and janitor. Studio owner Bart Koster later commented: \"He was so focused in everything he did. When that guy waxed the floor, it looked great.\" Reznor asked Koster for permission to record demos of his own songs for free during unused studio time. Koster agreed, remarking that it cost him \"just a little wear on his tape heads\".\n\nWhile assembling the earliest Nine Inch Nails recordings, Reznor was unable to find a band that could articulate his songs as he wanted. Instead, inspired by Prince, he played all the instruments except drums himself. Reznor has continued in this role on most of the band's studio recordings, though he has occasionally involved other musicians, assistants, drummers and rhythm experts. Several labels responded favorably to the demo material and Reznor signed with TVT Records. Nine selections from the Right Track demos were unofficially released in 1988 as \"Purest Feeling\" and many of these songs appeared in revised form on \"Pretty Hate Machine\", Reznor's first official release under the Nine Inch Nails name.\n\nMost of Reznor's work as a musician has been as founding and primary member of Nine Inch Nails. \"Pretty Hate Machine\" was released in 1989 and was a moderate commercial success, certified Gold in 1992. Amid pressure from his record label to produce a follow-up to \"Pretty Hate Machine\", Reznor secretly began recording under various pseudonyms to avoid record company interference, resulting in an EP called \"Broken\" (1992). Nine Inch Nails was included in the Lollapalooza tour in the summer of 1991, and won a Grammy Award in 1993 under \"Best Heavy Metal Performance\" for the song \"Wish\".\n\nNine Inch Nails' second full-length album, \"The Downward Spiral\", entered the \"Billboard\" 200 chart in 1994 at number two, and remains the highest-selling Nine Inch Nails release in America. To record the album, Reznor rented and moved into the 10050 Cielo Drive mansion, where the 1969 Manson Family murders took place. He built a studio space in the house, which he renamed Le Pig, after the word that was scrawled on the front door in Sharon Tate's blood by her murderers. Reznor told \"Entertainment Weekly\" that, despite the notoriety attached to the house, he chose to record there because he \"looked at a lot of places, and this just happened to be the one I liked most\". He has also explained that he was fascinated by the house due to his interest in \"American folklore,\" but has stated that he does not \"want to support serial-killer bullshit.\"\n\nNine Inch Nails toured extensively over the next few years, including a performance at Woodstock '94, although he admitted to the audience that he did not like to play large venues. Around this time, Reznor's studio perfectionism, struggles with addiction, and bouts of writer's block prolonged the production of a follow-up to \"The Downward Spiral\".\nIn 1999 the double album \"The Fragile\" was released. It was partially successful, but lost money for Reznor's label, so he funded the North American Fragility Tour out of his own pocket. A further six years followed before the next Nine Inch Nails album, \"With Teeth\" was released. During the intermediary period between the two records Reznor went into rehab, and was able to manage his drug addictions. After \"With Teeth\" Reznor released the concept album \"Year Zero\", which has an alternate reality game themed after the album (see Year Zero (game)) which is about how the current policies of the American government will affect the world in the year 2020. After \"Year Zero's\" release in 2007 Reznor broke from large record labels, and released two albums, \"Ghosts I-IV\" and \"The Slip\" independently on his own label, \"The Null Corporation\". In 2009 Nine Inch Nails went on hiatus, following the Wave Goodbye Tour. In 2013 Nine Inch Nails returned to large record labels, signing with Columbia Records. In September the album \"Hesitation Marks\" was released, and earlier, in August, the ongoing Tension 2013 tour began.\n\nOne of Reznor's earliest collaborations was a Ministry side project in 1990 under the name of 1000 Homo DJs. Reznor sang vocals on a cover of Black Sabbath's \"Supernaut\". Due to legal issues with his label, Reznor's vocals had to be distorted to make his voice unrecognizable. The band also recorded additional versions with Al Jourgensen doing vocals. While there is still debate as to which version is Reznor and which is Jourgensen, it has been definitively stated that Reznor's vocals were used in the TVT Records' \"Black Box\" box set. He also performed with another of Jourgensen's side projects, Revolting Cocks, in 1990. He said: \"I saw a whole side of humanity that I didn't know existed. It was decadence on a new level, but with a sense of humor.\"\n\nReznor then sang the vocals on the 1991 Pigface track \"Suck\" from their first album \"Gub\", which also featured Steve Albini. Reznor sang backing vocals on \"Past the Mission\" on Tori Amos' 1994 album \"Under the Pink\". He produced Marilyn Manson's first album, \"Portrait of an American Family\" (1994), and several tracks on Manson's albums \"Smells Like Children\" (1995) and \"Antichrist Superstar\" (1996). Relations between Reznor and Manson subsequently soured, and Manson later said: \"I had to make a choice between being friends and having a mediocre career, or breaking things off and continuing to succeed. It got too competitive. And he can't expect me not to want to be more successful than him.\"\n\nReznor was in the David Bowie video for the song \"I'm Afraid of Americans\" in 1997. In the video, Reznor is a stalker who shows up wherever David Bowie goes. In a 2016 Rolling Stone article after Bowie's death, Reznor recalled how touring with Bowie in 1995-96 inspired Reznor to stay sober.\n\nReznor produced a remix of The Notorious B.I.G.'s song \"Victory\", featuring Busta Rhymes, in 1998. Under the stage name Tapeworm, Reznor collaborated for nearly 10 years with Danny Lohner, Maynard James Keenan, and Atticus Ross, but the project was eventually terminated before any official material was released. The only known released Tapeworm material is a reworked version of a track called \"Vacant\" (retitled \"Passive\") on A Perfect Circle's 2004 album \"eMOTIVe\",<ref name=\"Vacant/Passive\"></ref> as well as a track called \"Potions\" on Puscifer's 2009 album \"\"C\" Is for\".\n\nIn 2006, Reznor played his first \"solo\" shows at Neil Young's annual Bridge School Benefit. Backed by a four piece string section, he performed stripped-down versions of many Nine Inch Nails songs. Reznor featured on El-P's 2007 album \"I'll Sleep When You're Dead\", providing guest vocals on the track \"Flyentology\". Reznor co-produced Saul Williams' 2007 album \"The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!\" after Williams toured with Nine Inch Nails in 2005 and 2006. Reznor convinced Williams to release the album as a free download, while giving fans the option of paying $5 for higher quality files, or downloading all of the songs at a lower quality for free. Reznor was also credited as \"Musical Consultant\" on the 2004 film \"Man on Fire\". The movie features six Nine Inch Nails songs. He has produced a number of songs for Jane's Addiction in his home studio in Beverly Hills. The first recordings, new versions of the early tracks \"Chip Away\" and \"Whores\", were released simultaneously on Jane's Addiction's website and the NINJA 2009 Tour Sampler digital EP.\n\nIn November 2012, Reznor revealed on Reddit that he would be working with Queens of the Stone Age on a song for their sixth studio album, \"...Like Clockwork\". He had worked with the band once before, providing backing vocals on the title track of the 2007 album \"Era Vulgaris\". Josh Homme has since revealed that Reznor was originally meant to produce the album.\n\nIn January 2013, Reznor was seen in a documentary entitled \"Sound City\", directed by former Nirvana drummer and Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl. \"Sound City\" is based on real-life recording studio Sound City Studios, originating in Van Nuys, California. It has housed the works of some of the most famed names in music history since its founding in 1969. The film has been chosen as an official selection for the 2013 Sundance Film Festival and will be available to download from its official website on February 1, 2013. Reznor also contributed to the soundtrack for the film, on the track \"Mantra\", along with Dave Grohl and Josh Homme.\n\nReznor appeared in a live performance with Fleetwood Mac's Lindsey Buckingham, Dave Grohl, and Queens of the Stone Age at the January Grammy Award ceremony. In an interview with a New Zealand media outlet, Reznor explained his thought process at the time that he was considering his participation in the performance:\n\nIn April 2010, it was announced that Reznor had formed a new band with his wife, Mariqueen Maandig, and Atticus Ross, called How to Destroy Angels. The group digitally released a self-titled six song EP on June 1, 2010, with the retail edition becoming available on July 6, 2010. They covered the Bryan Ferry song \"Is Your Love Strong Enough?\" for the soundtrack for \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\", which was released on December 9, 2011. On September 21, 2012, Reznor announced that the group's next release would be an EP entitled \"An Omen EP\", set for release on Columbia Records in November 2012, and that some of the EP's songs would later appear on the band's first full-length album in 2013. On October 8, 2012, they released a song and music video from \"An Omen EP\" entitled \"Keep it Together\". How to Destroy Angels announced in January 2013 that their first full-length album entitled \"Welcome Oblivion\" would be released on March 5 of the same year.\n\nFollowing the release of \"Year Zero\", Reznor announced later that Nine Inch Nails had split from its contractual obligations with Interscope Records, and would distribute its next major albums independently. In May 2008 Reznor founded The Null Corporation and Nine Inch Nails released the studio album \"The Slip\" as a free digital download. In his appreciation for his following and fan base, and having no contractual obligation, he made \"The Slip\" available for free on his website, stating \"This one's on me.\" A month and a half after its online release, \"The Slip\" had been downloaded 1.4 million times from the official Nine Inch Nails website.\n\nIn February 2009, Reznor posted his thoughts about the future of Nine Inch Nails on NIN.com, stating that \"I've been thinking for some time now it's time to make NIN disappear for a while.\" Reznor noted in an interview on the official website that while he has not stopped creating music as Nine Inch Nails, the group will not be touring in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe original music from id Software's 1996 video game \"Quake\" is credited to \"Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails\"; Reznor helped record sound effects and ambient audio, and the NIN logo appears on the nailgun ammunition boxes in the game. Reznor's association with id Software began with Reznor being a fan of the original \"Doom\". He reunited with id Software in 2003 as the sound engineer for \"Doom 3\", though due to \"time, money and bad management\", he had to abandon the project, and his audio work did not make it into the game's final release.\n\nNine Inch Nails' 2007 major studio recording, \"Year Zero\", was released alongside an accompanying alternate reality game. With its lyrics written from the perspective of multiple fictitious characters, Reznor described \"Year Zero\" as a concept album criticizing the United States government's current policies and how they will affect the world 15 years in the future. In July 2012, it was announced that Reznor had composed and performed the theme music for \"\".\n\nIn 1994, Reznor produced the soundtrack for Oliver Stone's film \"Natural Born Killers\", using a portable Pro Tools in his hotel room. Nine Inch Nails recorded an exclusive song, \"Burn\" for the film. The group also recorded a cover version of Joy Division's \"Dead Souls\" for .\n\nHe produced the soundtrack for David Lynch's 1997 film \"Lost Highway\". He produced two pieces of the film's score, \"Driver Down\" and \"Videodrones; Questions\", with Peter Christopherson. He tried to get Coil onto the soundtrack, but couldn't convince Lynch. Nine Inch Nails also recorded a new song, \"The Perfect Drug\" for the soundtrack. The release spawned the single \"The Perfect Drug\", the music video for which was also directed by Mark Romanek.\n\nIn 2001, Reznor was asked by Mark Romanek to provide the score for \"One Hour Photo\", but the music did not work for the film and was not used. These compositions eventually evolved into \"Still\". A remix of the Nine Inch Nails track \"You Know What You Are?\" by Clint Mansell was used as part of the latter's soundtrack to the 2005 film adaptation of \"Doom\". In 2009, Trent Reznor composed \"Theme for Tetsuo\" for the Japanese cyberpunk film \"\" from Shinya Tsukamoto.\n\nReznor collaborated with Ross to compose the score for David Fincher's \"The Social Network\", a 2010 drama film about the founding of Facebook. Says Reznor, \"When I actually read the script and realized what he was up to, I said goodbye to that free time I had planned.\" The score was noted for portraying \"Mark Zuckerberg the genius, developing a brilliant idea over ominous undertones,\" and received nearly unanimous praise. The film's score was released in October 2010 in multiple formats, including digital download, compact disc, 5.1 surround on Blu-ray disc, and vinyl record. A 5-song sampler EP was released for free via digital download.\n\nOn January 7, 2011, Reznor announced that he would again be working with Fincher, this time to provide the score for the American adaptation of \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\". A cover of \"Immigrant Song\" by Led Zeppelin, produced by Reznor and Ross, with Karen O (of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs) as the featured singer, accompanied a trailer for the film. Reznor and Ross' second collaboration with Fincher was scored as the film was shot, based on the concept, \"What if we give you music the minute you start to edit stuff together?\" Reznor explained in 2014 that the composition process was \"a lot more work,\" and that he \"would be hesitant to go as far in that direction in the future.\"\n\nReznor and Ross again collaborated, to score Fincher's film \"Gone Girl\". Fincher was inspired by music he heard while at an appointment with a chiropractor and tasked Reznor with creating the musical equivalent of an insincere facade. Reznor explained Fincher's request in an interview:\n\nRichard Butler of The Psychedelic Furs sang a cover version of the song \"She,\" which was used in the film's teaser trailer. The soundtrack album was released on the Columbia label on September 30, 2014.\n\nDuring Reznor and Ross' keynote session at the 2014 \"Billboard and Hollywood Reporter Film & TV Music Conference,\" held on November 5, Reznor said that he is open to working with other filmmakers besides Fincher, the only director he had worked with as a composer up until that point: \"I'm open to any possibility ... Scoring for film kind of came up unexpectedly. It was always something I'd been interested in and it was really a great experience and I've learned a lot.\" Reznor further explained that he cherishes his previous experiences with Fincher, as \"There's a pursuit and dedication to uncompromised excellence.\"\n\nIn 2004, Reznor's former manager John Malm Jr. filed suit in the United States district court of Ohio against Reznor for over $2 million in deferred commissions. The suit alleged that Reznor \"reneged on every single contract he and Malm ever entered into\", and that Reznor refused to pay Malm payments to which he was contractually entitled.\nWeeks later, Reznor filed a counter-suit in the U.S. District Court of New York, charging Malm with fraud and breach of fiduciary duties. Reznor's suit arose from a five-year management contract signed in the early days of Nine Inch Nails, between Reznor and Malm's management company J. Artist Management. This contract, according to the suit, was unlawful and immoral in that it secured Malm 20% of Reznor's \"gross\" earnings, rather than his \"net\" earnings, as is the standard practice between artists and their management. The suit also alleged that the contract secured this percentage even if Malm was no longer representing Reznor, and for all Reznor's album advances. The suit also described how Malm had misappropriated the ownership rights regarding Nine Inch Nails, including the trademark name \"NIN\". According to testimony by Malm, Reznor gave him half of the \"NIN\" trademark \"as a gift.\"\n\nReznor stated that he began to fully understand his financial situation after tackling his addiction to drugs and alcohol. Reznor requested a financial statement from Malm in 2003, only to discover that he had only $400,000 in liquid assets. \"It was not pleasant discovering you have a 10th as much as you've been told you have,\" Reznor told the court. Malm's lawyers, however, claimed that Malm had worked for years \"pro bono\", and that Reznor's inability to release an album or tour and his uninhibited spending were the reasons for Reznor's financial situation.\n\nAfter a three-week trial in 2005, jurors sided with Reznor, awarding him upwards of $2.95 million and returning to him complete control of his trademarks. After adjustment for inflation, Reznor's award rose to nearly $5 million.\n\nIn January 2013, Reznor and TopSpin Media founder Ian Rogers were chosen to head Beats Electronics' new music subscription service, Project Daisy, described by Beats co-founder Jimmy Iovine as having \"hardware, brand, distribution partnerships, and artist relations to differentiate Daisy from the competition\". There was some speculation as to what Reznor's role would be within the company, but he was later named chief creative officer. He promised that he and the other members would strive to create a music subscription service that will be like \"having your own guy when you go to the record store, who knows what you like but can also point you down some paths you wouldn't have necessarily encountered\". The service was officially launched in the United States on January 21, 2014.\n\nReznor has continued on in a similar role under Beats' new ownership at Apple, where he has been involved in the launch of Apple Music.\n\nIn May 2007, Reznor made a post on the official Nine Inch Nails website condemning Universal Music Group—the parent company of the band's record label, Interscope Records—for their pricing and distribution plans for Nine Inch Nails' 2007 album \"Year Zero\". He labeled the company's retail pricing of \"Year Zero\" in Australia as \"ABSURD,\" concluding that \"as a reward for being a 'true fan' you get ripped off\". Reznor went on to say that as \"the climate grows more and more desperate for record labels, their answer to their mostly self-inflicted wounds seems to be to screw the consumer over even more.\" Reznor's post, specifically his criticism of the recording industry at large, elicited considerable media attention. In September 2007, Reznor continued his attack on Universal Music Group at a concert in Australia, urging fans there to \"steal\" his music online instead of purchasing it legally. Reznor went on to encourage the crowd to \"steal and steal and steal some more and give it to all your friends and keep on stealin'.\"\n\nWhile on tour in Prague in 2009, Reznor realized the importance of the marketing aspect of a major label when he saw a lot of promotion for Radiohead's then-upcoming tour, but little promotion for his current Nine Inch Nails tour or any of its recently released albums. Reznor said the marketing from a major label outweighed the aspects of being independent that he liked, namely the ability to release albums whenever he wanted to avoid leaking, and to take a larger cut of the profits from record sales. Reznor's first album released through a major label after his return was How to Destroy Angels' \"An Omen EP\" released in November 2012 through Columbia Records. On working with Columbia for the release of the EP, Reznor said that \"so far it's been pleasantly pleasant\".\n\nIn 2013, Reznor returned to Columbia Records for \"Hesitation Marks\", the eighth Nine Inch Nails studio album.\n\nReznor's style in the early days of Nine Inch Nails was described by \"People\" magazine in 1995 as \"self-loathing, sexual obsession, torture and suicide over a thick sludge of gnashing guitars and computer-synthesized beats\". The magazine also said that \"[Reznor], like Alice Cooper and Ozzy Osbourne before him, has built his name on theatrics and nihilism\". Nine Inch Nails concerts were often picketed by fundamentalist Christians. Reznor's former high school band director considered him to be \"very upbeat and friendly\" in reality and theorized that \"all that 'dark avenging angel' stuff is marketing\". Conversely, the owner of the recording studio where Reznor recorded the first Nine Inch Nails album said of Reznor's \"pain-driven\" stage act, \"It's planned, but it is not contrived. He's pulling that stuff out from inside somewhere. You cannot fake that delivery.\" Pain and sorrow came to be regarded as such defining elements of Reznor's music that a group of fans once responded with joy when told that his dog had died because \"it's good for his music when he is depressed\" and that \"it's good to see [Reznor] back in hell, where he belongs\".\n\nReznor possesses a baritone vocal range. He is a fan of David Bowie, and has cited Bowie's 1977 album \"Low\" as one of his favorite albums. Reznor has stated that he played the album constantly during the recording of \"The Downward Spiral\" for inspiration. In 1995, Nine Inch Nails toured as a co-headlining act on the North American leg of David Bowie's Outside Tour. Reznor also appeared in Bowie's video for \"I'm Afraid of Americans\", cast as Bowie's stalker. Reznor also made several remixes for the single release of the same song, as well as a remix of \"The Hearts Filthy Lesson\". Reznor also states in the 2010 documentary \"\" that the band Rush had played a major part in his childhood influences. He also stated that he considered Rush to be \"one of the best bands ever\" and had gained a perspective on how keyboards could be introduced into hard rock after listening to their 1982 album \"Signals\".\n\nReznor once said that \"Freddie Mercury's death meant more to [him] than John Lennon's\", and he covered Queen's \"Get Down Make Love\", which was co-produced by Ministry frontman Al Jourgensen and released on the single for \"Sin\". He also expressed the significant influence that Coil had on his work, saying that \"Horse Rotorvator\" was \"deeply influential\". In many interviews with \"Musician\", \"Spin\", and \"Alternative Press\", Reznor mentioned Devo, The Cars, The Jesus and Mary Chain, My Bloody Valentine, Pere Ubu, Soft Cell, Prince, Ministry, Gary Numan, and The Cure's 1985 album, \"The Head on the Door\", as important influences. According to Todd Rundgren, Reznor told him that he listened to Rundgren's 1973 album, \"A Wizard, a True Star\" with \"great regularity\". In a radio interview, Reznor stated the first song he ever wrote \"Down in It\" was a \"total rip-off\" of the Skinny Puppy song \"Dig It.\"\n\nReznor's work as Nine Inch Nails has influenced many newer artists, which according to Reznor range from \"generic imitations\" dating from the band's initial success to younger bands echoing his style in a \"truer, less imitative way\". Following the release of \"The Downward Spiral\", mainstream artists began to take notice of Nine Inch Nails' influence: David Bowie compared NIN's impact to that of The Velvet Underground. In 1997, Reznor appeared in \"Time\" magazine's list of the year's most influential people, and \"Spin\" magazine described him as \"the most vital artist in music\". Bob Ezrin, producer for Pink Floyd, Kiss, Alice Cooper, and Peter Gabriel, described Reznor in 2007 as a \"true visionary\" and advised aspiring artists to take note of his no-compromise attitude. During a rare appearance at the \"Kerrang! Awards\" in London that year, Reznor accepted the \"Kerrang!\" Icon, honoring Nine Inch Nails' long-standing influence on rock music.\nSteven Wilson of progressive rock band Porcupine Tree has stated that he is influenced by and much admires Reznor's production work, in particular \"The Fragile\". Timbaland, one of pop music's most successful producers in recent years, has cited Reznor as his favorite studio producer.\n\nIn 2011, Reznor and Ross won the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score and the Academy Award for Original Score for their work on \"The Social Network\".\n\nFor their work on \"Girl with a Dragon Tattoo\", Reznor and Ross were nominated for the 2012 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score, and won the 2013 Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media. Neither Reznor nor Ross was present to accept the award, but Reznor published a thank you on his Twitter profile.\n\nRoss and Reznor's \"Gone Girl\" score was nominated for Best Original Score in a Feature Film at the 5th Hollywood Music in Media Awards (HMMA)—the award was eventually won by Antonio Sanchez for \"Birdman\" on November 4, 2014. In a November 2014 interview with \"The Hollywood Reporter\", Reznor revealed that he values Oscar trophies above Grammy awards: \"When the Oscar [nomination] came up, it felt very different. I can't tell if that's because I'm older or it felt like it's coming from a more sincere pedigree.\"\n\nDuring the five years following the release of \"The Downward Spiral\", Reznor suffered depression, and the death of his grandmother (who raised him). During this period of intense grief, he began abusing alcohol, cocaine, and other drugs.\nIn 2001, Reznor successfully completed rehab, and eventually moved from New Orleans to Los Angeles. In a 2005 interview with \"Kerrang\", he reflected on his self-destructive past: \"There was a persona that had run its course. I needed to get my priorities straight, my head screwed on. Instead of always working, I took a couple of years off, just to figure out who I was and working out if I wanted to keep doing this or not. I had become a terrible addict; I needed to get my shit together, figure out what had happened.\" In contrast to his former suicidal tendencies, he admitted in another interview that he is \"pretty happy\". Nine Inch Nails' next full-length album, \"With Teeth\" (2005), reached number one on the \"Billboard\" 200.\n\nReznor married Filipino-American singer-songwriter Mariqueen Maandig in October 2009. They have four children: sons Lazarus Echo Reznor (born October 10, 2010) and Balthazar Venn Reznor (born December 31, 2011), a third son whose name has not been revealed (born November 1, 2015), and daughter Nova Lux Reznor (born December 2016).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1599564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1599564", "title": "Tripod.com", "text": "Tripod.com\n\nTripod.com is a web hosting service owned by Lycos. Originally aiming its services to college students and young adults, it was one of several sites trying to build online communities during the 1990s. As such, Tripod formed part of the first wave of user-generated content.\n\nTripod offers free and paid web hosting services, including 20 megabytes of storage space and the ability to run Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts in Perl. In addition to basic hosting, Tripod also offers a blogging tool, a photo album manager, and the Trellix site builder for WYSIWYG page editing. Tripod's for-pay services include additional disk space, a shopping cart, domain names, web and POP/IMAP email.\n\nTripod originated in 1992 with two Williams College classmates, Bo Peabody and Brett Hershey, along with Dick Sabot, an economics professor at the school. The company was headquartered in Williamstown, Massachusetts, with Peabody as CEO. Although it would eventually focus on the Internet, Tripod also published a magazine, \"Tools for Life\", that was distributed with textbooks, and offered a discount card for students.\n\nThe domain name Tripod.com was created on September 29, 1994, and the site officially launched in 1995 after operating in \"sneak-preview mode\" for a period. Billed as a \"hip Web site and pay service for and by college students\", it offered how-to advice on practical issues that might concern young people when first living away from home. It planned to charge a minimal fee and make money primarily on commissions from partners who would sell products on the site. Other services available included résumé writing features and a simple home page builder.\n\nAlthough the feature was an afterthought originally, Tripod soon became known as a place where people could create free web pages, competing with the likes of Yahoo! GeoCities and Angelfire. Criticizing AOL, the existing leader in this space, for its \"walled-garden\" approach, Peabody described the company's aims: \"Our idea is to build a community through user-created and user-based content.\" A reviewer in \"The Washington Post\" recommended Tripod over GeoCities for giving users an easier URL to remember, and because GeoCities sites had a tendency to crash computers.\n\nAfter receiving an initial investment of US$4 million in venture capital, led by New Enterprises Associates, in May 1997 Tripod took an additional round of investment totaling US$10 million. By this time the company had grown to 40 employees and was hoping to reach profitability by the 1st quarter of 1998. The second group of investors included Interpublic, which paid US$2.5 million for a stake in Tripod estimated at 10 percent, thus implying a valuation of US$25 million for the company overall. As it turned out, Tripod would be sold in February 1998 to Lycos for a reported US$58 million in stock.\n\nLycos also ended up owning Tripod's former competitor Angelfire, picked up as part of the acquisition of WhoWhere. The two properties were run concurrently, with Tripod continuing to focus on its college-age audience while Angelfire tended to attract high school users. In early 2001, Tripod reached 6 million registered users (up from nearly 1 million at the time it was acquired) and was expanding at an estimated 250,000 new sites per month. However, generating profits remained difficult, with an analyst opining that they needed better user profiling so the sites could generate the results expected by advertisers. They also had the challenge of not alienating users while trying to make money. By the end of the year, Tripod and Angelfire also introduced account options allowing users to pay in order to keep their sites ad-free. GeoCities, now acquired by Yahoo!, would follow suit not long afterward.\n\nWeb sites generally are a subdomain of tripod.com. However, users can pay a monthly charge and own a domain name. Paying in this manner also allows for other benefits, such as more disk space for the site which allows the site owner to put more information onto it, and personalized email accounts, \"e.g.\", yourname@yoursite.com.\n\nOn January 18, 2009, the blog TechCrunch erroneously reported that Lycos would be shutting down the Tripod service on February 15, 2009. In fact, the February shutdown applied only to Lycos Europe and so only users of that service were affected. By the afternoon following the initial TechCrunch article, Lycos posted an entry on its Lycos Buzz blog assuring readers that Lycos US and the Tripod service were not shutting down. TechCrunch subsequently corrected the error in its original article.\n\n"}

Recent amendments to Article (217) of the CCL that came into force in June 2009 removed the requirement for minimum share capital (previously AED 300,000 in Dubai and AED 150,000 in other Emirates) allowing founders of a limited liability company the freedom to determine the company’s share capital which could be less than the earlier prescribed bottom line.\n\nA LLC must appoint a minimum of one manager and up to a maximum of five managers for the business. Managers must be appointed by a Memorandum of Association or by a management contract, for a fixed term or an unlimited term. Unless the Memorandum of Association states otherwise, the manager has full powers of administration and management of the LLC. LLC is not allowed to practice its activities in the UAE without a Trade License and Commercial Registration Certificate.\n\nEstablishing a business entity in one of the UAE's many Free trade zones (FTZs) can be an attractive option for foreign investors. UAE has over 35 FTAs of which more than 20 are located in Dubai. \nThe main attraction for setting up a company in a free zone is that there is no UAE national shareholding required. All free zones in UAE offer the following incentives:\n\nUAE Free Zone companies can only operate within the free zone boundaries and are generally limited to performing solely those activities listed in their license(s).\n\nIt is mandatory for every company registered in the Free Zone to lease minimum office space within that particular Free Zone. A Free Zone Company can obtain UAE residence visas for the director, shareholder and also employees of the company through the Free Zone where it is registered.\n\nUAE Offshore company registration is a very popular method of doing business in the Middle East region. \nIn UAE there are three offshore jurisdictions – Dubai (Jebel Ali Offshore Company) Ras Al Khaimahand Ajman. They offer similar services but serve different strategic goals of offshore company registration.The Jebel Ali Offshore Company is an International Business Crown/holds the only offshore vehicle that is permitted to own / hold real estate in the Emirate of Dubai.\n\nThe RAK Offshore and the RAK International Company (RAKIC) are International Business Companies. They provide a flexible and credible option for foreign investors to register an offshore company in UAE without the need to establish a physical presence in the UAE.\n\nUAE Offshore companies offer the following benefits:\n\nA branch office has the same legal identity as its parent company and conducts business under the name of its parent company. A branch office may only be engaged in activities similar to those of its parent company but it is not permitted to carry on the business of importing the products of its parent company, a function reserved for local trade agents. In some cases the Branch of a foreign company are required to obtain an additional license from UAE Ministry of Economy.\n\nRepresentative office, on the other hand, is limited to promoting its parent company’s activities i.e. gathering information and soliciting orders and projects to be performed by the company’s head office.\n\nA UAE national must be appointed as a ‘service agent’ for the branch or representative office.\n\nA civil company is a business partnership for professionals like doctors, lawyers, engineers and accountants.\nA civil company is 100% owned by the professional partners (except for engineering civil company), however, a UAE National Local Service Agent is normally required. \nA foreign company can be a partner in a civil company, as long as the foreign company is in the same field as the civil company.\n\n \n"}

He was released in 2013 after spending 17 years in jail, 10 years more than his recommended tariff, because he continued to protest his innocence. He was sentenced to a discretionary life sentence in 1998 and was refused parole because he refused to admit guilt. He was denied legal aid and in 2014, the Ministry of Justice turned down his claim for compensation and demanded he pay £2,500 costs claiming the DNA analysis \"did not show beyond reasonable doubt that the claimant did not commit the offence.\" \n\nThe Criminal Cases Review Commission commented that they should have investigated the case more thoroughly and commission chairman Richard Foster said “I regret the fact in this particular case we missed something and I apologise to all concerned for the fact we did so.” \n"}
