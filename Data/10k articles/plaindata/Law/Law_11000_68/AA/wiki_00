It was passed with 215 Republican votes against 205 votes of disapproval.\n\nThe repealed privacy protections approved in 2016 sought to regulate what companies can do with data of customers' browsing habits, communication contents, app usage history, location data and social security numbers and safeguard customer data against hackers and thieves.\n\nSupporters of the vote argue that the privacy regulations stifle innovation by forcing Internet providers to abide by unreasonably strict guidelines.\n\nDue to the repealment Internet service providers (ISP) like Comcast, AT&T and Verizon may sell Web browsing histories and other sensitive data directly to marketers, financial firms and other companies without consumers' consent. Furthermore, the FCC will be forbidden from issuing similar rules in the future.\n\nInternet providers have historically generated their revenue from selling access to the Internet and are now looking to increase their revenue by tapping the data their customers generate as they make use of the Internet.\n\nThe industry with its profit motive favors an interpretation of privacy that does not consider browsing history or app usage data to be sensitive and protected — the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) interpretation. However the FTC is unable to enforce its own guidelines without new authority from Congress.\n\nOn 16 March 2017 CTIA claims that \"Web browsing and app usage history are not 'sensitive information'\" in a filing with the FCC.\n\n\nMany of the privacy advocates who oppose ISP data sharing also oppose tracking by ad networks and technology companies such as Google but find ISP tracking extra worrisome as ISPs have access to all of one's browsing data − not just data from specific sites that share their data with particular ad networks, and as disabling cookies or adblockers can't prevent this sort of tracking.\n\nJeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy states that the vote means that \"Americans will never be safe online from having their most personal details stealthily scrutinized and sold to the highest bidder\".\n\nSenator Brian Schatz states that \"if this [resolution] is passed, neither the FCC nor the FTC will have clear authority when it comes to how Internet service providers protect consumers' data privacy and security. Regardless of politics, allowing ISPs to operate in a rule-free zone without any government oversight is reckless\".\n\nAccording to Anna Eshoo the consequences of the resolution's passage are clear: \"broadband providers like AT&T, Comcast, and others will be able to sell your personal information to the highest bidder without your permission\".\n\nMichael Copps, a former member of the Federal Communications Commission, called the bill a \"perversion of what the internet was supposed to be\".\n\nDallas Harris, an attorney who specializes in broadband privacy and a policy fellow at consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge notes that ISPs might be able to figure out where you bank, your political views, and your sexual orientation based on what sites you visit and asserts that \"the level of information that they can figure out is beyond what even most customers expect\". Various information can be extracted from Internet traffic − for instance \"the fact that you're looking at a website can reveal when you're home, when you're not home\" and according to her \"you don't need to see the contents of every communication to develop efficient ad tracking mechanisms\".\n\nSenator Ed Markey states that \"President Trump may be outraged by fake violations of his own privacy, but every American should be alarmed by the very real violation of privacy that will result [from] the Republican roll-back of broadband privacy protections\".\n\nCable lobby group NCTA says that they \"appreciate today's Senate action to repeal unwarranted FCC rules that deny consumers consistent privacy protection online and violate competitive neutrality\".\n\nMichael Capuano asks \"What the heck are you thinking? What is in your mind? Why would you want to give out any of our personal information to a faceless corporation for the sole purpose of them selling it?\".\n\nEvan Greer, campaign director of digital rights group Fight for the Future states that \"today Congress proved once again that they care more about the wishes of the corporations that fund their campaigns than they do about the safety and security of their constituents\". She also states that:\n\nCraig Aaron, Free Press Action Fund President and CEO writes in a statement:\n\nSearchInternetHistory.com is a crowdfunding campaign trying to raise $1 million to buy the browsing history of Republican officeholders like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Speaker Paul Ryan, and FCC Chair Ajit Pai.\n\nConsumers may switch to ISPs with better privacy protections. However this could be difficult for some as many Americans only have a choice of one or two broadband companies in their area according to federal statistics. Senator Ron Wyden states that thus their only choice may be between \"giving up their browsing history for an Internet provider to sell to the highest bidder or having no Internet at all\". Furthermore, the existence of such ISPs is not guaranteed and Jeremy Gillula, a senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation notes that it's \"unclear if they would even have to tell you they were doing it\".\n\nVPN can be used to protect ones data from ISPs or theoretically to subscribe to foreign ISPs with better privacy protections. However good VPNs generally cost money, take some effort and minor technical skills to set up, and will slightly degrade the connection speed.\n\nFurthermore, the Tor browser can be used to surf anonymously. This would however significantly slow down connection speed and not be adequate in most cases.\n\nAlso ISPs can't look into the encrypted traffic of sites that use TLS whose URLs starts with \"HTTPS\" but only the domain name. The HTTPS Everywhere browser extension allows for better protection via HTTPS. \nAlso apps that use end-to-end encryption can be used to protect communication contents.\n\nSome consumers might assume that they can protect their browsing histories by deleting them or by using privacy modes of browsers such as Chrome's \"incognito mode\" which is not the case.\n\n"}

He filled a vacancy of an unexpired term in District A from May 1980 to April 1982 and a full term until 1986.\n\nWagner was the younger of two sons of the late Wiltz W. Wagner, Sr., and Helen Bell Wagner (c. 1913–2004), who taught English at the University of New Orleans. Helen Wagner graduated from H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial College and Tulane University. She represented Louisiana as the \"Acadian Girl\" at the Paris World Exposition of 1931. A parishioner of the Episcopalian Christ Church Cathedral in New Orleans, she also served on the vestry and altar guild. Wagner's brother, Wiltz Wagner, Jr. (born July 7, 1939), of Fairhope, Alabama, is a Ph.D. professor and lung specialist at the University of South Alabama College of Medicine in Mobile.\n\nWagner attended Isidore Newman School, New Orleans Academy, and Tulane University. He operated an insurance agency on Carondelet Street in New Orleans.\n\nIn later years, Wagner became heavily involved in horse racing. He often spent summers in Del Mar, California, to be near the famed racetrack. Wagner won the 2009 National Handicapping Championship Tour, as it was then known, and qualified twelve times to the National Horseplayers Championship, during which he earned $101,000. He was part of the NHC since its founding in 1999. For two years, he could not qualify because his wife and the mother of their three children, the former Judy White (born June 9, 1950), sat on the board of directors of the National Thoroughbred Racing Association.\n\nIn the nonpartisan blanket primary held on April 5, 1980 in District A, Wagner polled 5,513 votes (24.4 percent) and went into the May 17 general election against Democrat Florence W. \"Flo\" Schornstein (born August 1934), who polled 7,037 (31.2 percent). Five other Democratic candidates received 44.4 percent in the primary. Wagner secured considerable Democratic support and went on to defeat Mrs. Schornstein, 11,900 votes (51.2 percent) to 11,353 ballots (48.8 percent). The position opened when Frank Friedler retired after serving for six years on the council.\n\nSince Wagner's tenure, only a handful of Republicans have been elected to the New Orleans City Council: \n\nWagner's election to the city council marked a turning point for District A (Lakeview and Uptown), which did not again elect a Democrat until 2006, with the victory of Shelley Midura, who unseated the last Republican in the seat, Jay Batt. “If it hadn’t been for Bryan Wagner, I’m not sure there would be much of a Republican Party in Orleans Parish,” said Batt, the head of the Orleans Parish Republican Executive Committee. Peggy Wilson, who succeeded Wagner in District A, credited Wagner's support for her having been chosen as his successor: \"He was very nice to me the whole time that we ran, which was unusual … He sent me flowers the day after the election when I had lost to him [in 1982]. ... He understood politics better than anyone I ever met.”\n\nThe electoral success of Wilson, Terrell, and Batt benefited from the Republican leanings of District A.\n\nWagner served on numerous municipal boards and commissions, including the Audubon Commission and the board of the New Orleans Morial Convention Center, named for the first African-American mayor of New Orleans, Democrat Ernest Nathan Morial. He was said to have worked well with Democrats in developing policy.\n\nIn 1986, Wagner was named Republican national committeeman for Louisiana to succeed Frank Spooner of Monroe, who stepped down after nine years in the position. Wagner remained active in the state party. He headed the Louisiana delegation to the 2008 Republican National Convention in Minneapolis, which nominated the McCain-Palin ticket. Spooner was also a delegate to the 2008 convention.\n\nIn 1996, in supporting Bob Dole of Kansas in the unsuccessful race against U.S. President Bill Clinton, Wagner said that the Louisiana GOP should conduct a serious outreach into the black community. \n\nIn 2008, Wagner served as manager for the successful campaign of Joseph Cao for Louisiana's 2nd congressional district. Cao was subsequently unseated in 2010 by the Democrat Cedric Richmond, who still holds the seat.\n\nUpon Wagner's death at the age of seventy-five, Republican U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy released a statement: \"Bryan was a stalwart leader for our party for fifty years, long before Republicans could even dream of being elected in Orleans Parish. He will be sorely missed, and his many contributions to the cause will make a difference for years to come. Laura and I extend our heartfelt condolences to Bryan’s wife, Judy, and the rest of his family.”\n\nWagner's memorial service was held on August 6, 2018 at the chapel at Christ Church, 2919 St. Charles Avenue. \n"}

{"id": "7604", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7604", "title": "Code of Hammurabi", "text": "Code of Hammurabi\n\nThe Code of Hammurabi is a well-preserved Babylonian code of law of ancient Mesopotamia, dated back to about 1754 BC (Middle Chronology). It is one of the oldest deciphered writings of significant length in the world. The sixth Babylonian king, Hammurabi, enacted the code. A partial copy exists on a 2.25 metre (7.5 ft) stone stele. It consists of 282 laws, with scaled punishments, adjusting \"an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth\" (\"lex talionis\") as graded depending on social status, of slave versus free, man or woman.\n\nNearly half of the code deals with matters of contract, establishing the wages to be paid to an ox driver or a surgeon for example. Other provisions set the terms of a transaction, the liability of a builder for a house that collapses, or property that is damaged while left in the care of another. A third of the code addresses issues concerning household and family relationships such as inheritance, divorce, paternity, and reproductive behaviour. Only one provision appears to impose obligations on an official; this provision establishes that a judge who reaches an incorrect decision is to be fined and removed from the bench permanently. A few provisions address issues related to military service.\n\nThe code was discovered by modern archaeologists in 1901, and its \"editio princeps\" translation published in 1902 by Jean-Vincent Scheil. This nearly complete example of the code is carved into a basalt stele in the shape of a huge index finger, tall. The code is inscribed in the Akkadian language, using cuneiform script carved into the stele. \n\nIt is currently on display in the Louvre, with replicas in numerous institutions, including the Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago, the Northwestern Pritzker School of Law in Chicago, the Clendening History of Medicine Library & Museum at the University of Kansas Medical Center, the library of the Theological University of the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands, the Pergamon Museum of Berlin, the Arts Faculty of the University of Leuven in Belgium, the National Museum of Iran in Tehran, and the Department of Anthropology, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, the University Museum at the University of Pennsylvania, and Museum of the Bible in Washington, DC.\n\nHammurabi ruled for nearly 42 years, from about 1792 to 1749 BC according to the Middle chronology. In the preface to the law, he states, \"Anu and Bel called by name me, Hammurabi, the exalted prince, who feared God, to bring about the rule of righteousness in the land, to destroy the wicked and the evil-doers; so that the strong should not harm the weak; so that I should rule over the black-headed people like Shamash, and enlighten the land, to further the well-being of mankind.\" On the stone slab are 44 columns and 28 paragraphs that contained 282 laws. Some of these laws follow along the rules of \"an eye for an eye\".\n\nIt had been taken as plunder by the Elamite king Shutruk-Nahhunte in the 12th century BC and was taken to Susa in Elam (located in the present-day Khuzestan Province of Iran) where it was no longer available to the Babylonian people. However, when Cyrus the Great brought both Babylon and Susa under the rule of his Persian Empire, and placed copies of the document in the Library of Sippar, the text became available for all the peoples of the vast Persian Empire to view.\n\nIn 1901, Egyptologist Gustave Jéquier, a member of an expedition headed by Jacques de Morgan, found the stele containing the Code of Hammurabi during archaeological excavations at the ancient site of Susa in Khuzestan.\n\nThe Code of Hammurabi was one of the only sets of laws in the ancient Near East and also one of the first forms of law. The code of laws was arranged in orderly groups, so that all who read the laws would know what was required of them. Earlier collections of laws include the Code of Ur-Nammu, king of Ur (c. 2050 BC), the Laws of Eshnunna (c. 1930 BC) and the codex of Lipit-Ishtar of Isin (c. 1870 BC), while later ones include the Hittite laws, the Assyrian laws, and Mosaic Law.\nThese codes come from similar cultures in a relatively small geographical area, and they have passages which resemble each other.\nThe Code of Hammurabi is the longest surviving text from the Old Babylonian period. The code has been seen as an early example of a fundamental law, regulating a government – i.e., a primitive constitution. The code is also one of the earliest examples of the idea of presumption of innocence, and it also suggests that both the accused and accuser have the opportunity to provide evidence. The occasional nature of many provisions suggests that the code may be better understood as a codification of Hammurabi's supplementary judicial decisions, and that, by memorializing his wisdom and justice, its purpose may have been the self-glorification of Hammurabi rather than a modern legal code or constitution. However, its copying in subsequent generations indicates that it was used as a model of legal and judicial reasoning.\n\nWhile the Code of Hammurabi was trying to achieve equality, biases still existed towards those categorized in the lower end of the social spectrum and some of the punishments and justice could be gruesome. The magnitude of criminal penalties often was based on the identity and gender of both the person committing the crime and the victim. The Code issues justice following the three classes of Babylonian society: property owners, freed men, and slaves.\n\nPunishments for someone assaulting someone from a lower class were far lighter than if they had assaulted someone of equal or higher status. For example, if a doctor killed a rich patient, he would have his hands cut off, but if he killed a slave, only financial restitution was required. Women could also receive punishments that their male counterparts would not, as men were permitted to have affairs with their servants and slaves, whereas married women would be harshly punished for committing adultery.\n\nVarious copies of portions of the Code of Hammurabi have been found on baked clay tablets, some possibly older than the celebrated basalt stele now in the Louvre. The Prologue of the Code of Hammurabi (the first 305 inscribed squares on the stele) is on such a tablet, also at the Louvre (Inv #AO 10237). Some gaps in the list of benefits bestowed on cities recently annexed by Hammurabi may imply that it is older than the famous stele (currently dated to the early 18th century BC). Likewise, the Museum of the Ancient Orient, part of the Istanbul Archaeology Museums, also has a \"Code of Hammurabi\" clay tablet, dated to 1790 BC, in (Room 5, Inv # Ni 2358).\n\nIn July 2010, archaeologists reported that a fragmentary Akkadian cuneiform tablet was discovered at Tel Hazor, Israel, containing a c. 1700 BC text that was said to be partly parallel to portions of the Hammurabi code. The Hazor law code fragments are currently being prepared for publication by a team from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\n\nThe laws covered such subjects as:\n\nOne of the best known laws from Hammurabi's code was:\n\nHammurabi had many other punishments, as well. If a son strikes his father, his hands shall be hewn off. Translations vary.\n\nAdultery\n\nEx. Law # 129: \"If the wife of a man has been caught lying with another man, they shall bind them and throw them into the waters. If the owner of the wife would save his wife then in turn the king could save his servant.\"\n\n"}

It was first instituted by the Law of 10 January 1879, and, in its origins, was influenced by French copyright law and by the movement led by Victor Hugo for the international protection of literary and artistic works. As of 2006, the principal dispositions are contained in Book One of the Intellectual Property Law of 11 November 1987 as modified. A consolidated version of this law was approved by Royal Legislative Decree 1/1996 of 12 April 1996: unless otherwise stated, all references are to this law.\n\nThe conception of a \"protected work\" (\"objeto de propiedad intelectual\") in Spain (contained in Title II, Chapter 2) is \ngeneralist, and covers (art. 10.1) \"all original literary, artistic or scientific creations expressed in any medium or support\", including:\nCinematographic works, other audiovisual works and computer programs are subject to slightly different treatment from other types of work.\nThe title of a work is also protected so far as it is original (art. 10.2). Derived works are protected alongside\nthe protection of the original work (art. 11), and include:\nCollections of works (e.g. anthologies) and other collections of data which, by reason of the selection or arrangement of \nthe contents, constitute intellectual creations are also protected (art. 12)\n\nWorks are protected by \"the sole fact of their creation\" (art. 1), regardless of the nationality of the author or the \nplace of publication. Corporate persons can only be authors of collective works (arts. 4.2, 8).\n\nArticle 13 provides that the following official works are not covered by copyright protection:\nImages are only concerned by this exception to copyright protection when they form an integral part of any of the above, for \nexample the diagrams in a patent: otherwise the copyright is held by the author of the image (e.g. the photographer).\n\nRegistration of a protected work is optional, but a Register of Intellectual Property (\"Registro de la Propiedad Intelectual\") \nexists (see \"External links\") for authors who wish to take advantage of it. Registration provides \"prima facie\" \nevidence of creation and authorship (art. 140.3, renumbered to art. 145.3 by Ley 5/1998).\n\nThe author has the exclusive right to exploit the work in any way or form, subject to the legal limitations \non the exclusivity, and notably the rights of reproduction, distribution, public communication and transformation (art. 17). \nThe author may transfer any or all of these rights to another person, although such a transfer cannot prevent the author from \nproducing a collection (partial or complete) of his/her works (art. 22). Any agreement to transfer rights of exploitation must be made in \nwriting (art. 45): it cannot cover the totality of the future works of an author (art. 43.3), cannot require the \nauthor not to produce works in the future (art. 43.4) and cannot cover forms of distribution which do not exist at the \ntime of the agreement (art. 43.5). Such an agreement must normally guarantee the author a reasonable share of the income \nderived from the exploitation of the work (art. 46.1, 47), although a fixed-sum payment is allowed in certain \ncases (art. 46.2). The different rights of exploitation are independent of one another (art. 23).\n\nThe authors of works of plastic art have the right to 3% of the resale price of their works when the resale price is greater \nthan or equal to 300,000 pesetas (1,807 euros): this right cannot be renounced or transferred during the lifetime of the \nauthor (art. 24).\n\nThe main dispositions concerning the duration of copyright are contained in Title III, Chapter 1, as modified. In general, \ncopyright protection in Spain lasts for the life of the author plus seventy years (art. 26). Collective works are\nprotected for seventy years following publication (art. 28.2), as are pseudonymous and anonymous works unless the identity \nof the author becomes known (art. 27.2). It always assigns copyright to the author and he or she is not allowed to disclaim it. Posthumous works are protected for seventy years following publication provided \nthey are published within seventy years of the death of the author. All of these time periods \nare calculated starting from 1 January following death or publication (art. 30).\n\nAs in other countries, there are a number of societies which collectively manage the licensing of different types of work and the collection of royalties on behalf of copyright holders. \nThese societies (\"entidades de gestión\") are governed by Title IV of Book Three of the Intellectual Property Law (arts. 142–152, renumbered as arts. 147–157\nby the Ley 5/1998), which provides for their authorisation by the Ministry of Culture. The largest such copyright management society is the Sociedad General de Autores y Editores (SGAE), \nwhich was established by law in 1941 as the \"Sociedad General de Autores de España\" and which had a \"de facto\" monopoly on the collective management of copyright royalties before the passage of the 1987 Intellectual Property Law.\n\nThe moral rights of the author, contained in Chapter 3, Section 1, of Title II, go beyond the minimum requirements \nof the Berne Convention. They are enumerated in article 14:\nThe right to the respect of the integrity of the work is limited in the case of computer programs, where the author cannot \nobject to the production of future versions or derived works except with a specific agreement to that effect (art. 98). \nThe author of a work cannot renounce his/her moral rights, nor transfer them to another person during his/her lifetime.\n\nThe rights to be identified as author and to the respect of the integrity of the work are perpetual, and may be exercised \nafter the author's death by his/her executors, heirs or (by default) by the State (arts. 15, 16). The rights to \nmodify the work and to withdraw the work from commercial exploitation may only be exercised by the author during his/her \nlifetime (this is implicit in the wording of 5º and 6º of art. 14).\n\nThe special rules concerning audiovisual works are contained in Title VI of Book One. The authors of an audiovisual work are considered to be (art. 87):\nThe authors are presumed to grant an exclusive licence to the producer, unless there is an agreement to the contrary, covering the reproduction, communication to the public and distribution of the work (art. 88): this is the opposite of the case for other types of work, where the licence is assumed to be non-exclusive unless there is a provision to the contrary (art. 48).\nThe authors may only exercise their moral rights with relation to the final version of the work (art. 93).\n\nThe special rules concerning computer programs are contained in Title VII of Book One: through successive modifications, they are now very close to the rules for other types of work. Article 96 gives a definition of \"computer program\", and reiterates the criteria for copyright protection: the work is only protected to the extent that it is the author's own intellectual creation, and the ideas and principles underlying any of the elements of the program, \nincluding those underlying its interfaces, are \"not\" protected by copyright (under certain circumstances, they may be protectable by patent law). An employer is assumed to have an exclusive grant of the rights of exploitation of computer programs written by employees in the course of their work (art. 97.4). Article 100 lists the following specific limitations of the rights of exploitation of a computer program, insofar as the following are permitted:\nThe term of protection in computer programs is the same as that for other types of work (art. 98).\n\nA number of \"related\" rights are detailed in Book Two of the Intellectual Property Law: these are similar in form to the \nrights of Book One, but may not directly concern the author of the work. They are \"independent\" of the rights of the author of the work: this is especially important for photographs and audiovisual works, which are automatically protected by \nrelated rights regardless of their copyright status but which may also enjoy the greater protection provided by copyright. The limitations to copyright protection also apply to these related rights (art. 132).\n\nA performer is any person who \"presents, sings, reads, recites, interprets or exercutes a work in any form,\" including the stage director and the conductor of an orchestra (art. 105). Performers have the exclusive rights to authorize:\nThese rights last for fifty years from either the date of the performance or the date of publication of a recording of the performance, whichever is the later (art. 112). The period of protection runs to 31 December of the relevant year.\nPerformers also have the moral right to have their name associated with their performances, and to object to distortion or mutilation of their performances: these moral rights last for the life of the performaer and for twenty years after his or her death.\n\nThe person who makes a sound recording has the exclusive right to authorize the reproduction, the communication to the public and the distribution of that recording (arts. 114–117). These rights last for fifty years after the date of the recording \nor the date of publication, whichever is the later, and run to 31 December of the relevant year (art. 119). Corporate persons can be the holders of these rights if the recording was first made under their \"initiative and responsibility\".\n\nAn \"audiovisual recording\" (\"grabación audiovisual\") is any recording of a scene or sequence of images, with or without sound, whether or not it counts as an \"audiovisual work\" (\"obra audiovisual\") (art. 120): an example would be the images from a security camera. \nThe person who takes the \"initiative and responsibility\" to make such a recording has the exclusive right to authorize its reproduction, communication to the public and distribution (arts. 121–123). These rights extend to photographs taken during the production of \nan audiovisual recording (art. 124), and last for fifty years after the production of the recording or its publication, whichever is the later, running to 31 December of the relevant year (art. 125). They are independent of the copyright in the audiovisual work. \nCorporate persons can be the holders of these rights. All rights fall under Jurisdiction of local law\n\nBroadcasting organisations have the exclusive right to authorise (art. 126):\nThese rights last for fifty years from the date of broadcast, running to 31 December of the relevant year (art. 127).\n\nThe \"sui generis\" protection of databases was instituted by the Law 5/1998 of 6 March 1998 incorporating Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the Legal Protection of Databases. The provisions are \ncontained in Title VIII of Book Two (arts. 133–137 under the revised numbering), but are not included in the 1996 consolidated version of the Intellectual Property Law. Database rights specifically protect the \"substantial investment\" in the form of \"finance, time, energy or effort\", assessed \"either qualitatively or quantitatively\", which was necessary to create the database (art. 133.1).\n\nThe maker of the database, who may be a corporate person, can prevent a user from extracting \"all or a substantial portion, evaluated qualitatively or quantitatively,\" of the contents of the database, either through a single access or through multiple accesses (art. 133). The user may not \ndo anything which \"conflicts with the normal exploitation of the database\" or which \"unreasonably prejudices the legitimate interests of the maker of the database\" (art. 134) There are (limited) exceptions for the private use of non-electronic databases, for teaching and research and for \npublic security and for administrative or judicial procedures (art. 135).\n\nDatabase rights last for fifteen years from the completion of the database or from its publication, whichever is the later, although \"substantial changes\" to the database start a new period of protection: the protection runs to 31 December of the relevant year (art. 136). Database rights are independent of any copyright which might exist in the \ndatabase or its contents (art. 137); for example, a database which relied on a subjective choice of material could qualify for copyright as a compilation, and a database of copyrighted works (for example, Wikipedia) does not override the copyright existing on individual entries.\n\nThe main limitations to the exclusive rights of exploitation are contained in Title III, Chapter 2. The summary \nbelow does not follow the order of this chapter and the headings given below have no legal basis or force.\n\nThe law explicitly allows to make private copies of copyrighted work without the author's consent for published works if the copy is not for commercial use. To compensate authors, the law establishes a compensatory tax associated with certain recording media (CDs, DVDs, cassettes), managed through societies of authors and editors (as SGAE and CEDRO). Such private copies of a protected work must be made for the private use (not collective, nor lucrative) of the copier (2�º of \nart. 31): the author is compensated by a tax on the means of reproduction (e.g. photocopiers, blank cassettes) \ndetermined at article 25. However, computer programs can not be copied except for a backup copy (art. 99.2): they can \nbe modified for the sole use of the person performing the modification (art. 99.4). Any work can be played in a \"strictly home\" environment (art. 20.1) without the author's consent. The moral rights of the author can only be exercised in the \nrespect of the rights of owners of copies of the work or of rights to its exploitation, as detailed in article 14.\n\nSome consumer's associations and specialized lawyers contend that the current legislation allows file sharing (as with p2p networks) as this is not for profit and is for private use . Additionally, the Penal Code explicitly requires the intention of commercial profit in order to commit a crime against the Intellectual Property .\n\nLectures, addresses, judicial proceedings and other works of the same nature may be reproduced or communicated for the sole\npurpose of reporting on current events (art. 33.2). The proceedings of parliament and of public corporations may be \nreproduced or communicated for any purpose (art. 33.2). Works of news reporting may be reproduced in other news media, \nwith identification of the author and remuneration (art. 33.1). Any work which can be seen or heard may be reproduced, \ndistributed and publicly communicated for the purpose of, and only to the extent necessary for, providing information \nthereof in the context of reporting on current events (art. 34).\n\nMuseums, libraries and similar public or cultural institutions may make reproductions of works for the purposes of research (art. 37).\n\"Fragments\" of written, sound or audiovisual works or \"isolated\" plastic, photographic, figurative or analogous works may be \nincluded in another original work for the purposes of teaching or research (\"fines docentes o de investigación\") if the \nfollowing conditions are met (art. 32):\nPress reviews and collections are expressly covered by the provisions of article 32.\n\nWorks may be reproduced for judicial and administrative actions (1º of art. 31). Musical works may be performed at official public ceremonies and religious services, if these are free of charge to the public and if the musicians are not specifically \npaid for performing the protected works (art. 38). Transcription of works may be made into Braille or another medium \nspecific for the use of the blind, provided that the use of the copies is non-lucrative (3º of art. 31). The \nexecutors or heirs of a deceased author can be forced to publish the works which remained unpublished during the author's \nlifetime if their refusal to do so is judged contrary to article 44 of the Constitution \n(art. 40, Intellectual Property Law).\n\nWorks which are permanently situated in parks, streets, squares or public routes may be reproduced in paintings, drawings, \nphotographs and by audiovisual means (art. 35). Parodies of a work are permitted without the consent of the original \nauthor provided that there is no risk of confusion with the original work and that no damage is caused \n(\"ni se infiera un daño\") to the original work or to its author (art. 39).\n\nA work enters the public domain at the expiration of its term of protection. However, the \nrights to be identified as the author and to the respect for the integrity of the work are perpetual (art. 41), \nand must be respected even for works in the public domain.\n\nThe 1987 Intellectual Property Law established the \"Comisión Mediadora y Arbitral de la Propiedad Intelectual\" (\"Intellectual Property Mediation and Arbitration Commission\") \nunder the auspices of the Ministry of Culture (art. 153, renumbered as art. 158 by Ley 5/1998). Its role is to mediate between cable distributors \n(widespread and numerous in Spain) and rightsholders; and to arbitrate between copyright management societies and those who use their repertoires.\n\n\nThe first four of these laws are included in the consolidated version of the Intellectual Property Law.\n\nSpain is a signatory to the following international copyright treaties, which have direct force under Spanish law.\nSpain has also signed, but as of September 2006 not yet ratified, the WIPO Copyright Treaty.\n\nWorks by Spanish authors became eligible for U.S. copyright by a Presidential Proclamation of 10 July 1895 under the authority of The Chase Act of 1891, later section 9(b) of the Copyright Act of 1909. All Spanish works which had not entered the public domain in Spain through expiry of their copyright protection, that is all works first published in Spain by authors who are living or who died on or after 1 January 1926, were automatically accorded U.S. copyrights (if they were not already protected in the U.S.) on 1 January 1996 by the Uruguay Round Agreements Act of 1994: these U.S. copyrights run for 95 years from the date of publication (regardless of the Spanish copyright term) for works first published before 1 January 1978 and for collective or anonymous works, and for the life of the author plus seventy years (identical to the Spanish copyright term) for other works.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4582033", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4582033", "title": "Deterrence (penology)", "text": "Deterrence (penology)\n\nDeterrence is the use of punishment as a threat which is considered as a means to prevent people from offending or to reduce the probability and/or level of offending. \n\nThe concept of deterrence has two key assumptions: the first is that specific punishments imposed on offenders could prevent the offender from committing further crimes; the second is that fear of punishment could prevent others from committing similar crimes.\n\nDeterrence is often contrasted with retributivism, which holds that punishment is a necessary consequence of a crime which the offender deserves and its severity should be calculated based on the gravity of the wrong done. Rehabilitation is another different approach which attempts to reform the offender rather than using punishment.\n\nDeterrence can be divided into three separate categories.\n\nSpecific deterrence focuses on the individual in question. The aim of these punishments is to discourage the criminal from future criminal acts by instilling an understanding of the consequences.\n\nGeneral or indirect deterrence focuses on general prevention of crime by making examples of specific deviants. The individual actor is not the focus of the attempt at behavioral change, but rather receives punishment in public view in order to deter other individuals from deviance in the future. The argument that deterrence, rather than retribution, is the main justification for punishment is a hallmark of the rational choice theory and can be traced to Cesare Beccaria whose well-known treatise \"On Crimes and Punishments\" (1764) condemned torture and the death penalty, and Jeremy Bentham who made two distinct attempts during his life to critique the death penalty.\n\nIncapacitation is considered sometimes to be a subset of specific deterrence. Incapacitation aims to prevent future crimes not by rehabilitating the individual but rather from taking away his ability to commit such acts. Under this theory, criminals are put in jail not so that they will learn the consequence of their actions but rather so that while they are there, they will be unable to engage in crime.\n\nNot all crime deterrence comes from a criminal justice system, rather it also comes from social forces. Controversial academic Gary Kleck goes further to conclude that evidence suggests that private gun ownership and use significantly deter crime, although many academics have concluded otherwise.\n\nMarginal deterrence, a principle in the theory of criminal justice, states that it is prudent to punish a more severe crime more severely than a lesser crime and a series of crimes more severely than a single crime of the same kind. Marginal deterrence is intended to deter criminals to limit their criminal acts. Without marginal deterrence, a criminal could benefit from committing additional crimes or using illegal methods to suppress law enforcement, witnesses or evidence. As an example, if robbery without force resulted in the same punishment as robbery by murder, a robber could make a rational choice to kill the victims to evade their testimonies. Marginal deterrence is therefore similar in conclusion but different in the justifying rationale from the doctrine of proportionality often invoked in discussions of retributive justice.\n\nMeasuring and estimating the effects of criminal sanction on subsequent criminal behavior is the historic and conceptual core of criminology. Despite numerous studies using a variety of data sources, sanctions, crime types, statistical methods and theoretical approaches, there remains little agreement in the scientific literature about whether, how, under what circumstances, to what extent, for which crimes, at what cost, for which individuals, and perhaps most importantly, in which direction do various aspects of contemporary criminal sanctions affect subsequent criminal behavior. There are extensive reviews of this literature with somewhat conflicting assessments.\n\nSome research has shown that increasing the \"severity\" of a punishment does not have much effect on crime, while increasing the \"certainty\" of punishment does have a deterrent effect. \"Clearly, enhancing the severity of punishment will have little impact on people who do not believe they will be apprehended for their actions.\" Similarly, enhancing the certainty of punishment will have little impact on people who do not believe that the sanctions to be imposed will be severe.\n\nThe use of 'heavy' punishment has been described as \"the least effective and least fair principle of sentencing\". A study by a Canadian criminologist Paul Gendreau brought together the results of 50 different studies of the deterrent effect of imprisonment involving over 300,000 offenders. The report said: \"None of the analyses found imprisonment reduced recidivism. The recidivism rate for offenders who were imprisoned as opposed to given a community sanction was similar. In addition, longer sentences were not associated with reduced recidivism. In fact the opposite was found. Longer sentences were associated with a 3% increase in recidivism. This finding suggests some support for the theory that prison may serve as a ‘school for crime’ for some offenders\".\n\nA 2000 study by Uri Gneezy and Aldo Rustichini, \"A Fine Is a Price\", has shown that introducing a fine for a previously unfined behavior may increase, rather than decrease, the unwanted behavior. This happens as the fine replaces a previous set of moral or ethical norms, and if it is low enough, it is going to be easier to overcome than the non-monetary criticism was. In other words, putting a price on something previously not on a market changes its perception drastically, and on occasion it can change it contradictory to what a deterrence theory would predict.\n\nThe most recent studies into the matter though have found that deterrence does cause a decrease in criminal acts. A study by Prof. D.S. Abrams found that when one uses \"the introduction of state add-on gun laws, which enhance sentences for defendants possessing a firearm during the commission of a felony, to isolate the deterrent effect of incarceration. Defendants subject to add-ons would be incarcerated in the absence of the law change, so any short-term impact on crime can be attributed solely to deterrence. Using cross-state variation in the timing of law passage dates, I find that the average add-on gun law results in a roughly 5 percent decline in gun robberies within the first three years. This result is robust to a number of specification tests and does not appear to be associated with large spillovers to other types of crime.\"\n\nKuziemko found that sentence length has a substantial negative effect on recidivism: a three percent decline in recidivism for every extra month served.\n\nAnother study using a European natural experiment and the 1996 Bastille Day pardon in France to estimate the effect of sentence reductions on recidivism found that \"[I]ndividuals who were in French prisons by Bastille Day benefited from a basic sentence reduction of one week, plus one additional week of reduction per residual month of sentence by Bastille Day, with total reduction not exceeding 4 months. By construction, this collective pardon generated a very significant discontinuity in the relationship between time served in prison and prospective date of release.\" They find that a greater sentence reduction via the pardon leads to an increase in expected future recidivism.\n\nAccording to Francesco Drago, Roberto Galbiati & Pietro Vertova, The Deterrent Effects of Prison: Evidence from a Natural Experiment, 117 J. POL. ECON. 257, 258–60 (2009), \"using a natural experiment in Italy to corroborate a general deterrence theory, finding that an extra month in expected sentence reduces the likelihood to recommit a crime by 1.3%\".\n\nEric Helland & Alexander Tabarrok found that California’s three-strikes law has a deterrent effect and reduces third-strike arrests by 17–20%; Levitt, supra note 16, at 360–70 finding deterrence to be a more important factor than incapacitation in explaining \"the negative correlation between arrest rates and crime\".\n\nOne criticism of deterrence theory is that it can clash with widely held notions of which crimes are more serious than others. For example, although most Americans regard stealing money from the government as a more serious offense than failing to pay the same amount in taxes, the United States Sentencing Commission punished tax evasion more severely because tax evaders were detected less frequently than thieves and therefore a harsher punishment was needed to achieve the same deterrent effect as a more certain punishment.\n\n"}
{"id": "49764", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49764", "title": "End-user license agreement", "text": "End-user license agreement\n\nIn proprietary software, an end-user license agreement (EULA) or software license agreement is the contract between the licensor and purchaser, establishing the purchaser's right to use the software. The license may define ways under which the copy can be used, in addition to the automatic rights of the buyer including the first sale doctrine and (freedom to use, archive, re-sale, and backup with legal restrictions).\n\nMany form contracts are only contained in digital form, and only presented to a user as a click-through where the user must \"accept\". As the user may not see the agreement until after he or she has already purchased the software, these documents may be contracts of adhesion.\n\nSoftware companies often make special agreements with large businesses and government entities that include support contracts and specially drafted warranties.\n\nSome end-user license agreements accompany shrink-wrapped software that is presented to a user sometimes on paper or more usually electronically, during the installation procedure. The user has the choice of accepting or rejecting the agreement. The installation of the software is conditional to the user clicking a button labelled \"accept\". See below.\n\nMany EULAs assert extensive liability limitations. Most commonly, an EULA will attempt to hold harmless the software licensor in the event that the software causes damage to the user's computer or data, but some software also proposes limitations on whether the licensor can be held liable for damage that arises through improper use of the software (for example, incorrectly using tax preparation software and incurring penalties as a result). One case upholding such limitations on consequential damages is \"M.A. Mortenson Co. v. Timberline Software Corp., et al.\" Some EULAs also claim restrictions on venue and applicable law in the event that a legal dispute arises.\n\nSome copyright owners use EULAs in an effort to circumvent limitations the applicable copyright law places on their copyrights (such as the limitations in sections 107–122 of the United States Copyright Act), or to expand the scope of control over the work into areas for which copyright protection is denied by law (such as attempting to charge for, regulate or prevent private performances of a work beyond a certain number of performances or beyond a certain period of time). Such EULAs are, in essence, efforts to gain control, by contract, over matters upon which copyright law precludes control. \nThis kind of EULAs concurs in aim with DRM and both may be used as alternate methods for widening control over software.\n\nIn disputes of this nature in the United States, cases are often appealed and different circuit courts of appeal sometimes disagree about these clauses. This provides an opportunity for the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene, which it has usually done in a scope-limited and cautious manner, providing little in the way of precedent or settled law. \n\nEnd-user license agreements are usually lengthy, and written in highly specific legal language, making it difficult for the average user to give informed consent. If the company designs the end-user license agreement in a way that intentionally discourages users to read them, and uses difficult to understand language, many users may be unable to give their informed consent. This is especially relevant when these agreements concern the privacy of the users. However, users are ultimately responsible for reading signing and understanding these agreements.\n\nA free software license grants users of that software the rights to use for any purpose, modify and redistribute creative works and software, both of which are forbidden by the defaults of copyright, and generally not granted with proprietary software. These licenses typically include a disclaimer of warranty, but this feature is not unique to free software.\n\nCopyleft licenses also include a key addition provision that must be followed in order to copy or modify the software, that requires the user to provide source code for the work and to distribute their modifications under the same license (or sometimes a compatible one); thus effectively protecting derivative works from losing the original permissions and being used in proprietary programs.\n\nUnlike EULAs, free software licenses do not work as contractual extensions to existing legislation. No agreement between parties is ever held, because a copyright license is simply a declaration of permissions on something that otherwise would be disallowed by default under copyright law.\n\nThe term shrink-wrap license refers colloquially to any software license agreement which is enclosed within a software package and is inaccessible to the customer until after purchase. Typically, the license agreement is printed on paper included inside the boxed software. It may also be presented to the user on-screen during installation, in which case the license is sometimes referred to as a click-wrap license. The inability of the customer to review the license agreement before purchasing the software has caused such licenses to run afoul of legal challenges in some cases.\n\nWhether shrink-wrap licenses are legally binding differs between jurisdictions, though a majority of jurisdictions hold such licenses to be enforceable. At particular issue is the difference in opinion between two US courts in \"Klocek v. Gateway\" and \"Brower v. Gateway\". Both cases involved a shrink-wrapped license document provided by the online vendor of a computer system. The terms of the shrink-wrapped license were not provided at the time of purchase, but were rather included with the shipped product as a printed document. The license required the customer to return the product within a limited time frame if the license was not agreed to. In \"Brower\", New York's state appeals court ruled that the terms of the shrink-wrapped license document were enforceable because the customer's assent was evident by its failure to return the merchandise within the 30 days specified by the document. The U.S. District Court of Kansas in \"Klocek\" ruled that the contract of sale was complete at the time of the transaction, and the additional shipped terms contained in a document similar to that in \"Brower\" did not constitute a contract, because the customer never agreed to them when the contract of sale was completed.\n\nFurther, in \"ProCD v. Zeidenberg\", the license was ruled enforceable because it was necessary for the customer to assent to the terms of the agreement by clicking on an \"I Agree\" button in order to install the software. In Specht v. Netscape Communications Corp., however, the licensee was able to download and install the software without first being required to review and positively assent to the terms of the agreement, and so the license was held to be unenforceable.\n\nClick-wrap license agreements refer to website based contract formation (see iLan Systems, Inc. v. Netscout Service Level Corp.). A common example of this occurs where a user must affirmatively assent to license terms of a website, by \"clicking\" \"yes\" on a pop-up, in order to access website features. This is therefore analogous to shrink-wrap licenses, where a buyer implied agrees to license terms by first removing the software package's shrink-wrap and then utilizing the software itself. In both types of analysis, focus is on the actions of end user and asks whether there is an explicit or implicit acceptance of the additional licensing terms.\n\nMost licenses for software sold at retail disclaim (as far as local laws permit) any warranty on the performance of the software and limit liability for any damages to the purchase price of the software. One well-known case which upheld such a disclaimer is Mortenson v. Timberline .\n\nIn addition to the implied exhaustion doctrine, the distributor may include patent licenses along with software.\n\nForms often prohibit users from reverse engineering. This may also serve to make it difficult to develop third-party software which interoperates with the licensed software, thus increasing the value of the publisher's solutions through decreased customer choice. In the United States, EULA provisions can preempt the reverse engineering rights implied by fair use, c.f. Bowers v. Baystate Technologies.\n\nSome licenses purport to prohibit a user's right to release data on the performance of the software, but this has yet to be challenged in court.\n\nThe enforceability of an EULA depends on several factors, one of them being the court in which the case is heard. Some courts that have addressed the validity of the shrinkwrap license agreements have found some EULAs to be invalid, characterizing them as contracts of adhesion, unconscionable, and/or unacceptable pursuant to the U.C.C.—see, for instance, \"Step-Saver Data Systems, Inc. v. Wyse Technology\", \"Vault Corp. v. Quaid Software Ltd.\". Other courts have determined that the shrinkwrap license agreement is valid and enforceable: see \"ProCD, Inc. v. Zeidenberg\", \"Microsoft v. Harmony Computers\", \"Novell v. Network Trade Center\", and \"Ariz. Cartridge Remanufacturers Ass'n v. Lexmark Int'l, Inc.\" may have some bearing as well. No court has ruled on the validity of EULAs generally; decisions are limited to particular provisions and terms.\n\nThe 7th Circuit and 8th Circuit subscribe to the \"licensed and not sold\" argument, while most other circuits do not . In addition, the contracts' enforceability depends on whether the state has passed the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) or Anti-UCITA (UCITA Bomb Shelter) laws. In Anti-UCITA states, the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) has been amended to either specifically define software as a good (thus making it fall under the UCC), or to disallow contracts which specify that the terms of contract are subject to the laws of a state that has passed UCITA.\n\nRecently, publishers have begun to encrypt their software packages to make it impossible for a user to install the software without either agreeing to the license agreement or violating the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and foreign counterparts.\n\nThe DMCA specifically provides for reverse engineering of software for interoperability purposes, so there was some controversy as to whether software license agreement clauses which restrict this are enforceable. The 8th Circuit case of \"Davidson & Associates v. Jung\" determined that such clauses are enforceable, following the Federal Circuit decision of \"Baystate v. Bowers\".\n\nJerry Pournelle wrote in 1983, \"I've seen no evidence to show that ... Levitical agreements — full of \"Thou Shalt Nots\" — have any effect on piracy\". He gave an example of an EULA that was impossible for a user to comply with, stating \"Come on, fellows. No one expects these agreements to be kept\". Noting that in practice many companies were more generous to their customers than their EULAs required, Pournelle wondered \"Why, then, do they insist on making their customers sign 'agreements' that the customer has no intention of keeping, and which the company \"knows\" won't be kept? ... Must we continue making hypocrites out of both publishers and customers?\"\n\nOne common criticism of end-user license agreements is that they are often far too lengthy for users to devote the time to thoroughly read them. In March 2012, the PayPal end-user license agreement was 36,275 words long and in May 2011 the iTunes agreement was 56 pages long. News sources reporting these findings asserted that the vast majority of users do not read the documents because of their length.\n\nSeveral companies have parodied this belief that users do not read the end-user-license agreements by adding unusual clauses, knowing that few users will ever read them. As an April Fool's Day joke, Gamestation added a clause stating that users who placed an order on April 1, 2010 agreed to irrevocably give their soul to the company, which 7,500 users agreed to. Although there was a checkbox to exempt out of the \"immortal soul\" clause, few users checked it and thus Gamestation concluded that 88% of their users did not read the agreement. The program PC Pitstop included a clause in their end-user license agreement stating that anybody who read the clause and contacted the company would receive a monetary reward, but it took four months and over 3,000 software downloads before anybody collected it. During the installation of version 4 of the Advanced Query Tool the installer measured the elapsed time between the appearance and the acceptance of the end-user license agreements to calculate the average reading speed. If the agreements were accepted fast enough a dialog window “congratulated” the users to their absurdly high reading speed of several hundred words per second. \"South Park\" parodied this in the episode \"HumancentiPad\", where Kyle had neglected to read the terms of service for his last iTunes update and therefore inadvertently agreed to have Apple employees experiment upon him.\n\nEnd-user license agreements have also been criticized for containing terms that impose onerous obligations on consumers. For example, Clickwrapped, a service that rates consumer companies according to how well they respect the rights of users, reports that they increasingly include a term that prevents a user from suing the company in court.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1593709", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1593709", "title": "Enforcement Directive", "text": "Enforcement Directive\n\nDirective 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement of intellectual property rights (also known as \"(IPR) Enforcement Directive\" or \"IPRED\") is a European Union directive in the field of intellectual property law, made under the internal market provisions of the Treaty of Rome. The directive covers civil remedies only—not criminal ones.\n\nUnder Article 3(1), Members States can be censured in the European Court of Justice if their civil procedures on the infringement of intellectual property rights are \"unnecessarily complicated or costly, or entail unreasonable time-limits or unwarranted delays\". Otherwise the Directive harmonises the rules on standing, evidence, interlocutory measures, seizure and injunctions, damages and costs and judicial publication.\n\nThe Directive requires all Member States to apply effective, dissuasive and proportionate remedies and penalties against those engaged in counterfeiting and piracy. Thus, the purpose of the instrument is to regulate enforcement of intellectual property rights, not the rights themselves. The Directive leaves unaffected the substantive provisions on intellectual property, international obligations of the Member States and national provisions relating to criminal procedure and criminal enforcement. In short, the Directive adds extra measures on enforcement of digital copyright while leaving national law in other areas unaffected.\n\nThe subject-matter of the Directive is defined in Article 1. It applies to enforcement of intellectual property rights which include industrial property rights. The scope of the Directive is defined in Article 2. It applies to all infringements of IP rights in Community and national law, without precluding more stringent protection that the Community or national law may otherwise grant.\n\nThe general obligation in the Directive is to provide for remedies necessary to enforce intellectual property rights. These shall be \"fair and equitable\" and must not be \"complicated or costly, or entail unreasonable time-limits or unwarranted delays\". They must furthermore be effective, proportionate and dissuasive and must not act as barriers to trade.\n\nThe persons who are entitled to apply for the remedies are primarily the holder of intellectual property right, but also any person authorised to use it, such as licencees and intellectual property rights. Collective rights management and professional defence bodies may also have the right under certain circumstances.\n\nSection 2 of the Directive deals with the evidence. Article 6 gives the power to the interested party to apply for evidence regarding an infringement that lies in the hands of the other party to be presented. The only requirement is for that party to present \"reasonably available evidence sufficient to support its claim\" to courts. In case of an infringement on a commercial scale, Member States must also take steps to ensure that \"banking, financial or commercial documents\" of the opposing party are presented. In both cases confidential information shall be protected.\n\nMeasures for preserving evidence are available even before the proceedings commence. Article 7 provides that such measures may be granted under the same conditions as under Article 6 and include provisional measures such as physical seizure not only of the infringing goods (such as hard drives) but also materials used in the production and distribution (e.g., French Saisie-contrefaçon).\n\nArticle 6 provides that such measures may be taken \"without the other party having been heard, in particular where any delay is likely to cause irreparable harm to the rightholder or where there is a demonstrable risk of evidence being destroyed\". These are interlocutory, ex parte and in personam orders known in the English and Irish jurisdictions as Anton Piller orders; they are not used outside the UK and Ireland.\n\nAt the request of an applicant, the judicial authorities may issue an interlocutory injunction to prevent an \"imminent infringement\" of intellectual property rights or to prevent a continuing infringement. In the latter case, the order may be followed with a recurring penalty payment or lodging of a guarantee intended to compensate the rightholder (paragraph a). An injunction can also be issued, under the same conditions, against an intermediary, but these are covered in Article 8(2) of the Information Society Directive and are, in principle, subject to national law.\n\nApart from the ordinary injunctions of the previous paragraph there also exist the so-called Mareva injunctions in Article 9(2). In common law, these are ex parte and in personam orders used to freeze assets (including bank accounts) to prevent abuses of process. They can be issued as worldwide injunctions, preventing worldwide dispersal. In that case, their effectiveness depends on their in personam character, as a party who is found to be guilty of disposing of assets will be held to be in contempt of court. Like Anton Piller orders, their use is confined mostly to the UK.\n\nArticle 9(2) provides that, in the case of an infringement on a commercial scale, judicial authorities may order a precautionary seizure of \"movable and immovable property\" which includes freezing the bank accounts and other assets. This may only be done if the applicant demonstrates that it is likely that recovery of damages will be endangered. Further to that, documents relating to banking and other financial transaction may be communicated.\n\nThe provisions of the Directive were due to be implemented in all member states of the European Union by 29 April 2006. However, a number of states have not completed the necessary steps.\n\nThe Directive has been implemented into United Kingdom law by the Intellectual Property (Enforcement, etc.) Regulations 2006. The Directive has been implemented into Dutch law, and came into force on 1 May 2007. It has been implemented in France on 27 June 2008. The Swedish parliament voted to implement the Directive on 26 February 2009, and it went into force on 1 April 2009.\n\nThe Directive has been widely criticised for what opponents called a draconian approach similar to the United States' Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). In fact, the criticism was so strong—especially from the telecommunications industry and parts of computer industry—that the original draft was substantially modified. A number of problems still remain in the final document, according to the international civil liberties organisation IP Justice.\n\nIn the 2007 \"Princo Corporation, Ltd v Koninklijke Philips Electronics\" case before the Court of Genoa, Italy, the Dutch company Philips, owner of patents on CD-R technology, requested and obtained an order of precautionary seizure over all Princo's movable and immovable property, including its bank accounts, with a view to ensuring the recovery of damages to be awarded at the end of the liability proceedings.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20705253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20705253", "title": "Estate liquidation", "text": "Estate liquidation\n\nAn estate liquidation is similar to an estate sale in that the main concern or goal is to liquidate the estate (home, garage, sheds and yard) with an estate sale organization while also often adding the contents of a safe deposit box, family heirlooms too valuable to be left within the constraints of the family home, real estate, cars, boats, and other transportation such as motor homes and RVs, animals, livestock and whatever other assets the estate may encompass.\n\nIn the United States, while it is necessary in most states that a realtor be present to write up the documents for the sale of real land, most other items do not require any other license or permit other than the local licenses needed to run a business in that city, county or state where the liquidation is taking place. Oftentimes the family will retain a lawyer to oversee the process of liquidation and to keep the system straight on legalities of stocks and bonds being traded, investments liquidated and any real property changing hands legally.\n\nEstate liquidations happen mostly like estate sales, with the liquidators making the home and items to be sold ready for a public sale. Most liquidators will charge a commission of a percentage of the net profit.\n\nThe main differences between an estate liquidation and a mere estate sale is the sphere of inclusion which in a liquidation can expand to stocks, bonds, real property, fine jewelry, coin collections and fine art. Often an estate liquidation is accompanied by realtors, attorneys, Certified Public Accountants, and appraisers, while an estate sale can be done by anyone with knowledge of value of household items and collectibles in question.\n\nBesides estate sales, liquidating the estate may be done in the form of an auction or the estate liquidator will offer a cash buy-out for the entire contents of a home.\n"}

{"id": "1014322", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1014322", "title": "Fiduciary", "text": "Fiduciary\n\nA fiduciary is a person who holds a legal or ethical relationship of trust with one or more other parties (person or group of persons). Typically, a fiduciary prudently takes care of money or other assets for another person. One party, for example, a corporate trust company or the trust department of a bank, acts in a fiduciary capacity to another party, who, for example, has entrusted funds to the fiduciary for safekeeping or investment. Likewise, asset managers, including managers of pension plans, endowments, and other tax-exempt assets, are considered fiduciaries under applicable statutes and laws. In a fiduciary relationship, one person, in a position of vulnerability, justifiably vests confidence, good faith, reliance, and trust in another whose aid, advice, or protection is sought in some matter. In such a relation good conscience requires the fiduciary to act at all times for the sole benefit and interest of the one who trusts.\n\nFiduciary duties in a financial sense exist to ensure that those who manage other people’s money act in their beneficiaries' interests, rather than serving their own interests. The Fiduciary Duty in the 21st Century programme finds that, \"far from being a barrier, there are positive duties to integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in investment processes.\" The programme also concludes that “integrating ESG issues into investment research and processes will enable investors to make better investment decisions and improve investment performance consistent with their fiduciary duties.” See section 'fiduciary duty and pension governance'. \n\nA fiduciary duty is the highest standard of care in equity or law. A fiduciary is expected to be extremely loyal to the person to whom he owes the duty (the \"principal\") such that there must be no conflict of duty between fiduciary and principal, and the fiduciary must not profit from his position as a fiduciary (unless the principal consents). The nature of fiduciary obligations differs among jurisdictions. In Australia, only proscriptive or negative fiduciary obligations are recognised, whereas in Canada fiduciaries can come under both proscriptive (negative) and prescriptive (positive) fiduciary obligations.\n\nIn English common law, the fiduciary relation is an important concept within a part of the legal system known as equity. In the United Kingdom, the Judicature Acts merged the courts of equity (historically based in England's Court of Chancery) with the courts of common law, and as a result the concept of fiduciary duty also became applicable in common law courts.\n\nWhen a fiduciary duty is imposed, equity requires a different, stricter standard of behavior than the comparable tortious duty of care in common law. The fiduciary has a duty not to be in a situation where personal interests and fiduciary duty conflict, not to be in a situation where his fiduciary duty conflicts with another fiduciary duty, and a duty not to profit from his fiduciary position without knowledge and consent. A fiduciary ideally would not have a conflict of interest. It has been said that fiduciaries must conduct themselves \"at a level higher than that trodden by the crowd\" and that \"[t]he distinguishing or overriding duty of a fiduciary is the obligation of undivided loyalty\".\n\nDifferent jurisdictions regard fiduciary duties in different lights. Canadian law, for example, has developed a more expansive view of fiduciary obligation than American law, while Australian law and British law have developed more conservative approaches than either the United States or Canada.\nIn Australia, it has been found that there is no comprehensive list of criteria by which to establish a fiduciary relationship. Courts have so far refused to define the concept of a fiduciary, instead preferring to develop the law on a case-by-case basis and by way of analogy. Fiduciary relationships are of different types and carry different obligations so that a test appropriate to determine whether a fiduciary relationship exists for one purpose might be inappropriate for another:\n\nIn 2014 the Law Commission (England and Wales) reviewed the fiduciary duties of investment intermediaries, looking particularly at the duties on pension trustees. They commented that the term \"fiduciary\" is used in many different ways. \nThe question of who is a fiduciary is a \"notoriously intractable\" question and this was the first of many questions. In \"SEC v. Chenery Corporation\", Frankfurter J said,\n\nThe law expressed here follows the general body of elementary fiduciary law found in most common law jurisdictions; for in-depth analysis of particular jurisdictional idiosyncrasies please consult primary authorities within the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nThis is especially true in the area of Labor and Employment law. In Canada a fiduciary has obligations to the employer even after the employment relationship is terminated, whereas in the United States the employment and fiduciary relationships terminate together.\n\nThe corporate law of Delaware is the most influential in the United States, as more than 50% of publicly traded companies in the United States, including 64% of the Fortune 500, have chosen to incorporate in that State. Under Delaware law, officers, directors and other control persons of corporations and other entities owe three primary fiduciary duties, (1) the duty of care, (2) the duty of loyalty and (3) the duty of good faith.\n\nThe duty of care requires control persons to act on an informed basis after due consideration of all information. The duty includes a requirement that such persons reasonably inform themselves of alternatives. In doing so, they may rely on employees and other advisers so long as they do so with a critical eye and do not unquestionably accept the information and conclusions provided to them. Under normal circumstances, their actions are accorded the protection of the business judgment rule, which presumes that control persons acted properly, provided that they act on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company.\n\nThe duty of loyalty requires control persons to look to the interests of the company and its other owners and not to their personal interests. In general, they cannot use their positions of trust, confidence and inside knowledge to further their own private interests or approve an action that will provide them with a personal benefit (such as continued employment) that does not primarily benefit the company or its other owners.\n\nThe duty of good faith requires control persons to exercise care and prudence in making business decisions—that is, the care that a reasonably prudent person in a similar position would use under similar circumstances. Control persons fail to act in good faith, even if their actions are not illegal, when they take actions for improper purposes or, in certain circumstances, when their actions have grossly inequitable results. The duty to act in good faith is an obligation not only to make decisions free from self-interest, but also free of any interest that diverts the control persons from acting in the best interest of the company. The duty to act in good faith may be measured by an individual's particular knowledge and expertise. The higher the level of expertise, the more accountable that person will be (\"e.g.\", a finance expert may be held to a more exacting standard than others in accepting a third party valuation).\n\nAt one time, courts seemed to view the duty of good faith as an independent obligation. However, more recently, courts have treated the duty of good faith as a component of the duty of loyalty.\n\nIn Canada, directors of corporations owe a fiduciary duty. A debate exists as to the nature and extent of this duty following a controversial landmark judgment from the Supreme Court of Canada in \"BCE Inc. v. 1976 Debentureholders\". Scholarly literature has defined this as a \"tripartite fiduciary duty\", composed of (1) an overarching duty to the corporation, which contains two component duties — (2) a duty to protect shareholder interests from harm, and (3) a procedural duty of \"fair treatment\" for relevant stakeholder interests. This tripartite structure encapsulates the duty of directors to act in the \"best interests of the corporation, viewed as a good corporate citizen\".\n\nThe most common circumstance where a fiduciary duty will arise is between a trustee, whether real or juristic, and a beneficiary. The trustee to whom property is legally committed is the legal—i.e., common law—owner of all such property. The beneficiary, at law, has no legal title to the trust; however, the trustee is bound by equity to suppress their own interests and administer the property only for the benefit of the beneficiary. In this way, the beneficiary obtains the use of property without being its technical owner.\n\nOthers, such as corporate directors, may be held to a fiduciary duty similar in some respects to that of a trustee. This happens when, for example, the directors of a bank are trustees for the depositors, the directors of a corporation are trustees for the stockholders or a guardian is trustee of their ward's property. A person in a sensitive position sometimes protects themselves from possible conflict of interest charges by setting up a \"blind trust\", placing their financial affairs in the hands of a fiduciary and giving up all right to know about or intervene in their handling.\n\nThe fiduciary functions of trusts and agencies are commonly performed by a trust company, such as a commercial bank, organized for that purpose. In the United States, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), an agency of the United States Department of the Treasury, is the primary regulator of the fiduciary activities of federal savings associations.\n\nWhen a court desires to hold the offending party to a transaction responsible so as to prevent unjust enrichment, the judge can declare that a fiduciary relation exists between the parties, as though the offender were in fact a trustee for the partner.\n\nRelationships which routinely attract by law a fiduciary duty between certain classes of persons include these:\n\n\nIn Australia, it must be noted that the categories of fiduciary relationships are not closed.\n\nRoman and civil law recognized a type of contract called \"fiducia\" (also \"contractus fiduciae\" or fiduciary contract),\ninvolving essentially a sale to a person coupled with an agreement that the purchaser should sell the property back upon the fulfillment of certain conditions. Such contracts were used in the emancipation of children, in connection with testamentary gifts and in pledges. Under Roman law a woman could arrange a fictitious sale called a \"fiduciary coemption\" in order to change her guardian or gain legal capacity to make a will.\n\nIn Roman Dutch law, a \"fiduciary heir\" may receive property subject to passing it to another on fulfilment of certain conditions; the gift is called a \"fideicommissum\". The fiduciary of a fideicommissum is a \"fideicommissioner\" and one that receives property from a fiduciary heir is a \"fideicommissary heir\".\n\nFiduciary principles may be applied in a variety of legal contexts.\n\nJoint ventures, as opposed to business partnerships, are not \"presumed\" to carry a fiduciary duty; however, this is a matter of degree. If a joint venture is conducted at commercial arm's length and both parties are on an equal footing then the courts will be reluctant to find a fiduciary duty, but if the joint venture is carried out more in the manner of a partnership then fiduciary relationships can and often will arise.\n\nHusbands and wives are not \"presumed\" to be in a fiduciary relationship; however, this may be easily established. Similarly, ordinary commercial transactions in themselves are not \"presumed\" to but can give rise to fiduciary duties, should the appropriate circumstances arise. These are usually circumstances where the contract specifies a degree of trust and loyalty or it can be inferred by the court.\n\nAustralian courts also do not recognise parents and their children to be in fiduciary relationships. In contrast, the Supreme Court of Canada allowed a child to sue her father for damages for breach of his fiduciary duties, opening the door in Canada for allowing fiduciary obligations between parent and child to be recognised.\n\nAustralian courts have also not accepted doctor-patient relationships as fiduciary in nature. In \"Breen v Williams\", the High Court viewed the doctor's responsibilities over their patients as lacking the representative capacity of the trustee in fiduciary relationships. Moreover, the existence of remedies in contract and tort made the Court reluctant in recognising the fiduciary relationship.\n\nRecently, in an insider trading case, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission brought charges against a boyfriend of a Disney intern, alleging he had a fiduciary duty to his girlfriend and breached it. The boyfriend, Toby Scammell, allegedly received and used insider information on Disney's takeover of Marvel Comics.\n\nGenerally, the employment relationship is not regarded as fiduciary, but may be so if\n... within a particular contractual relationship there are specific contractual obligations which the employee has undertaken which have placed him in a situation where equity imposes these rigorous duties in addition to the contractual obligations. Although terminologies like duty of good faith, or loyalty, or the mutual duty of trust and confidence are frequently used to describe employment relationships, such concepts usually denote situations where \"a party merely has to take into consideration the interests of another, but does not have to act in the interests of that other.\n\nIf fiduciary relationships are to arise between employers and employees, it is necessary to ascertain that the employee has placed himself in a position where he must act solely in the interests of his employer. In the case of \"Canadian Aero Service Ltd v O'Malley\", it was held that a senior employee is much more likely to be found to owe fiduciary duties towards his employer.\n\nA protector of a trust may owe fiduciary duties to the beneficiaries, although there is no case law establishing this to be the case.\n\nIn 2015, the United States Department of Labor issued a proposed rule that if finalized would extend the fiduciary duty relationship to investment advisory and some brokers including insurance brokers. In 2017, the Trump Administration planned to order a 180-delay of implementation of the rule, sometimes known as the 'fiduciary rule'. The rule would require \"brokers offering retirement investment advice to put their clients' interest first.\" the Trump Administration later rescinded the fiduciary rule on July 20, 2018. Prior to its repeal, the rule was also dealt blows by the US Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in March and June 2018.\n\nFor example, two members of a band currently under contract with one another (or with some other tangible, existing relationship that creates a legal duty), \"X\" and \"Y\", record songs together. Let us imagine it is a serious, successful band and that a court would declare that the two members are equal partners in a business. One day, \"X\" takes some demos made cooperatively by the duo to a recording label, where an executive expresses interest. \"X\" pretends it is all his work and receives an exclusive contract and $50,000. \"Y\" is unaware of the encounter until reading it in the paper the next week.\n\nThis situation represents a conflict of interest and duty. Both \"X \"and \"Y\" hold fiduciary duties to each other, which means they must subdue their own interests in favor of the duo's collective interest. By signing an individual contract and taking all the money, \"X\" has put personal interest above the fiduciary duty. Therefore, a court will find that \"X\" has breached his fiduciary duty. The judicial remedy here will be that \"X\" holds both the contract and the money in a constructive trust for the duo. Note, \"X\" will not be punished or totally denied of the benefit; both \"X\" and \"Y\" will receive a half share in the contract and the money.\n\nA fiduciary, such as the administrator, executor or guardian of an estate, may be legally required to file with a probate court or judge a surety bond, called a fiduciary bond or probate bond, to guarantee faithful performance of his duties. One of those duties may be to prepare, generally under oath, an \"inventory\" of the tangible or intangible property of the estate, describing the items or classes of property and usually placing a valuation on them.\n\nA bank or other fiduciary having legal title to a mortgage may sell fractional shares to investors, thereby creating a \"participating mortgage\".\n\nA fiduciary will be liable to account if proven to have acquired a profit, benefit or gain from the relationship by one of three means:\n\n\nTherefore, it is said the fiduciary has a duty not to be in a situation where personal interests and fiduciary duty conflict, a duty not to be in a situation where his fiduciary duty conflicts with another fiduciary duty, and not to profit from his fiduciary position without express knowledge and consent. A fiduciary cannot have a conflict of interest.\n\nThe state of Texas in the United States sets out the duties of a fiduciary in its Estates Code, chapter 751, as follows (the bracketed references to TPC refer to the Texas Probate Code superseded by the Estates Code, effective January 1, 2014):\n\nis kept;\n\nA fiduciary's duty must not conflict with another fiduciary duty. Conflicts between one fiduciary duty and another fiduciary duty arise most often when a lawyer or an agent, such as a real estate agent, represent more than one client, and the interests of those clients conflict. This would occur when a lawyer attempts to represent both the plaintiff and the defendant in the same matter, for example. The rule comes from the logical conclusion that a fiduciary cannot make the principal's interests a top priority if he has two principals and their interests are diametrically opposed; he must balance the interests, which is not acceptable to equity. Therefore, the conflict of duty and duty rule is really an extension of the conflict of interest and duty rules.\n\nA fiduciary must not profit from the fiduciary position. This includes any benefits or profits which, although unrelated to the fiduciary position, came about because of an opportunity that the fiduciary position afforded. It is unnecessary that the principal would have been unable to make the profit; if the fiduciary makes a profit, by virtue of his role as fiduciary for the principal, then the fiduciary must report the profit to the principal. If the principal provides fully informed consent, then the fiduciary may keep the benefit and be absolved of any liability for what would be a breach of fiduciary duty. If this requirement is not met then the property is deemed by the court to be held by the fiduciary on constructive trust for the principal.\n\nSecret commissions, or bribes, also come under the no profit rule. The bribe shall be held in constructive trust for the principal. The person who made the bribe cannot recover it, since he has committed a crime. Similarly, the fiduciary, who received the bribe, has committed a crime. Fiduciary duties are an aspect of equity and, in accordance with the equitable principles, or maxims, equity serves those with clean hands. Therefore, the bribe is held on constructive trust for the principal, the only innocent party.\n\nBribes were initially considered not to be held on constructive trust, but were considered to be held as a debt by the fiduciary to the principal. This approach has been overruled; the bribe is now classified as a constructive trust. The change is due to pragmatic reasons, especially in regard to a bankrupt fiduciary. If a fiduciary takes a bribe and that bribe is considered a debt then if the fiduciary goes bankrupt the debt will be left in his pool of assets to be paid to creditors and the principal may miss out on recovery because other creditors were more secured. If the bribe is treated as held on a constructive trust then it will remain in the possession of the fiduciary, despite bankruptcy, until such time as the principal recovers it.\n\nThe landmark Australian decision \"ASIC v Citigroup\" noted that the \"informed consent\" on behalf of the beneficiary to breaches of either the no-profit and no-conflict rule will allow the fiduciary to get around these rules. Furthermore, it highlighted that a contract may include a clause that allows individuals to avoid all fiduciary obligations within the course of dealings, and thereby continue to make a personal profit or deal with other parties- tasks that may otherwise have been in conflict with what would have been a fiduciary duty had it not been for this clause. In the Australian case of \"Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd\", however, Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ observed that the sufficiency of disclosure may depend on the sophistication and intelligence of the persons to whom the disclosure must be made.\n\nHowever, in the English case of \"Armitage v Nurse\" an exception was noted to be the fiduciary's obligation of good faith; liability for breach of fiduciary duty by way of fraud or dishonesty cannot be avoided through an exclusion clause in a contract. The decision in \"Armitage v Nurse\" has been applied in Australian .\n\nConduct by a fiduciary may be deemed \"constructive fraud\" when it is based on acts, omissions or concealments considered fraudulent and that gives one an advantage against the other because such conduct—though not actually fraudulent, dishonest or deceitful—demands redress for reasons of public policy. Breach of fiduciary duty may occur in insider trading, when an insider or a related party makes trades in a corporation's securities based on material non-public information obtained during the performance of the insider's duties at the corporation. Breach of fiduciary duty by a lawyer with regard to a client, if negligent, may be a form of legal malpractice; if intentional, it may be remedied in equity.\nWhere a principal can establish both a fiduciary duty and a breach of that duty, through violation of the above rules, the court will find that the benefit gained by the fiduciary should be returned to the principal because it would be unconscionable to allow the fiduciary to retain the benefit by employing his strict common law legal rights. This will be the case, unless the fiduciary can show there was full disclosure of the conflict of interest or profit and that the principal fully accepted and freely consented to the fiduciary's course of action.\n\nRemedies will differ according to the type of damage or benefit. They are usually distinguished between proprietary remedies, dealing with property, and personal remedies, dealing with pecuniary (monetary) compensation. Where concurrent contractual and fiduciary relationships exist, remedies available to the plaintiff beneficiary is dependent upon the duty of care owed by the defendant and the specific breach of duty allowing for remedy/damages. The courts will clearly distinguish the relationship and determine the nature in which the breach occurred.\n\nWhere the unconscionable gain by the fiduciary is in an easily identifiable form, such as the recording contract discussed above, the usual remedy will be the already discussed constructive trust.\n\nConstructive trusts pop up in many aspects of equity, not just in a remedial sense, but, in this sense, what is meant by a constructive trust is that the court has created and imposed a duty on the fiduciary to hold the money in safekeeping until it can be rightfully transferred to the principal.\n\nAn account of profits is another potential remedy. It is usually used where the breach of duty was ongoing or when the gain is hard to identify. The idea of an account of profits is that the fiduciary profited unconscionably by virtue of the fiduciary position, so any profit made should be transferred to the principal. It may sound like a constructive trust at first, but it is not.\n\nAn account of profits is the appropriate remedy when, for example, a senior employee has taken advantage of his fiduciary position by conducting his own company on the side and has run up quite a lot of profits over a period of time, profits which he wouldn't have been able to make otherwise. The fiduciary in breach may however receive an allowance for effort and ingenuity expended in making the profit.\n\nCompensatory damages are also available. Accounts of profits can be hard remedies to establish, therefore, a plaintiff will often seek compensation (damages) instead. Courts of equity initially had no power to award compensatory damages, which traditionally were a remedy at common law, but legislation and case law has changed the situation so compensatory damages may now be awarded for a purely equitable action.\n\nThe Fiduciary Duty in the 21st Century Programme, led by the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative, the Principles for Responsible Investment, and the Generation Foundation, aims to end the debate on whether fiduciary duty is a legitimate barrier to the integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues in investment practice and decision-making. This followed the 2015 publication of \"Fiduciary Duty in the 21st Century\" which concluded that “failing to consider all long-term investment value drivers, including ESG issues, is a failure of fiduciary duty\". Founded on the realization that there is a general lack of legal clarity globally about the relationship between sustainability and investors’ fiduciary duty, the programme engaged with and interviewed over 400 policymakers and investors to raise awareness of the importance of ESG issues to the fiduciary duties of investors. The programme also published roadmaps which set out recommendations to fully embed the consideration of ESG factors in the fiduciary duties of investors across more than eight capital markets.

{"id": "178043", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=178043", "title": "Fragging", "text": "Fragging\n\nFragging is the deliberate killing or attempted killing by a soldier of a fellow soldier, usually a superior officer or non-commissioned officer (NCO). The word was coined by U.S. military personnel during the Vietnam War, when such killings were most often attempted with a fragmentation grenade, sometimes making it appear as though the killing was accidental or during combat with the enemy. The term fragging is now often used to encompass any means used to deliberately and directly cause the death of military colleagues.\n\nThe high number of fragging incidents in the latter years of the Vietnam War was symptomatic of the unpopularity of the war with the American public and the breakdown of discipline in the U.S. Armed Forces. Documented and suspected fragging incidents totaled nearly nine hundred from 1969 to 1972.\n\nSoldiers have killed colleagues, especially superior officers, since the beginning of armed conflict, with many documented instances throughout history. (One such attempt was on unpopular Civil War general Braxton Bragg.) However, the practice of fragging seems to have been relatively uncommon in American armies until the Vietnam War. The prevalence of fragging was partially based on the ready availability of fragmentation hand grenades. Grenades were untraceable to an owner and did not leave any ballistic evidence. M18 Claymore mines and other explosives were also occasionally used in fragging, as were firearms, although the term, as defined by the military during the Vietnam War, applied only to the use of explosives to kill fellow soldiers. Most fragging incidents were in the Army and Marine Corps. Fragging was rare among Navy and Air Force personnel who had less access to grenades and weapons than did soldiers and marines.\n\nThe first known incidents of fragging in South Vietnam took place in 1966, but events in 1968 appear to have catalyzed an increase in fragging. After the Tet Offensive in January and February 1968, the Vietnam War became increasingly unpopular in the United States and among American soldiers in Vietnam, many of them conscripts. Secondly, racial tensions between white and African-American soldiers and marines increased after the assassination of Martin Luther King in April 1968. With soldiers reluctant to risk their lives in what was perceived as a lost war, fragging was seen by some enlisted men \"as the most effective way to discourage their superiors from showing enthusiasm for combat.\"\n\nMorale plummeted among soldiers and marines. By 1971, a U.S. Army colonel declared in the Armed Forces Journal that \"The morale, discipline, and battleworthiness of the U.S. Armed Forces are, with a few salient exceptions, lower and worse than at any time in this century and possibly in the history of the United States.\"\n\nThe U.S. military reflected social problems and issues in the U.S. such as racism, drug use, and resentment toward authoritarian leaders. As the U.S. began to withdraw its military forces from Vietnam, some American enlisted men and young officers lost their sense of purpose for being in Vietnam, and the relationship between enlisted men and their officers deteriorated. The resentment directed from enlisted men toward older officers was exacerbated by generational gaps, as well as different perceptions of how the military should be conducted. Enforcement of military regulations, especially if done overzealously, led to troops' complaining and sometimes threats of physical violence directed toward officers.\n\nA number of factors may have influenced the incidence of fragging. The demand for manpower for the war in Vietnam caused the armed forces to lower their standards for inducting both officers and enlisted men. The rapid rotation of personnel, especially of officers who served on the average less than six months in command roles, decreased the stability and cohesion of military units. Most important of all, perhaps, was the loss of purpose in fighting the war, as it became apparent to all that the United States was withdrawing from the war without having achieved any sort of victory. Morale and discipline deteriorated.\n\nMost fragging was perpetrated by enlisted men against leaders. Enlisted men, in the words of one company commander, \"feared they would get stuck with a lieutenant or platoon sergeant who would want to carry out all kinds of crazy John Wayne tactics, who would use their lives in an effort to win the war single-handedly, win the big medal, and get his picture in the hometown paper.\" Harassment of subordinates by a superior was another frequent motive. The stereotypical fragging incident was of \"an aggressive career officer being assaulted by disillusioned subordinates.\" Several fragging incidents resulted from alleged racism between African-American and white soldiers. Attempts by officers to control drug use caused others. Most known fragging incidents were carried out by soldiers in support units rather than soldiers in combat units.\n\nSoldiers sometimes used non-lethal smoke and tear-gas grenades to warn superiors that they were in danger of being fragged if they did not change their behavior. A few instances occurred—and many more were rumored—in which enlisted men collected \"bounties\" on particular officers or non-commissioned officers to reward soldiers for fragging them.\n\nAccording to author George Lepre, the total number of known and suspected fragging cases by explosives in Vietnam from 1969 to 1972 totaled nearly 900 with 99 deaths and many injuries. This total is incomplete as some cases were not reported, nor were statistics kept before 1969 although several incidents from 1966 to 1968 are known. Most of the victims or intended victims were officers or non-commissioned officers. The number of fraggings increased in 1970 and 1971 even though the U.S. military was withdrawing and the number of U.S. military personnel in Vietnam was declining.\n\nAn earlier calculation by authors Richard A. Gabriel and Paul L. Savage, estimated that up to 1,017 fragging incidents may have taken place in Vietnam causing 86 deaths and 714 injuries of U.S. military personnel, the majority officers and NCOs.\n\nFragging statistics include only incidents involving explosives, most commonly grenades. Several hundred murders of U.S. soldiers by firearms occurred in Vietnam but most were of enlisted men killing enlisted men of nearly equal rank. Fewer than 10 officers are known to have been murdered by firearms. However, rumors and claims abound of deliberate killing of officers and non-commissioned officers by enlisted men under battlefield conditions. The frequency and number of these fraggings, indistinguishable from combat deaths, cannot be quantified.\n\nThe U.S. military's responses to fragging incidents included greater restrictions on access to weapons, especially grenades, for soldiers in non-combat units and \"lockdowns\" after a fragging incident in which a whole unit was isolated until an investigation was concluded. For example, in May 1971, the U.S. Army in Vietnam temporarily halted the issuance of grenades to nearly all its units and soldiers in Vietnam, inventoried stocks of weapons, and searched soldier's quarters, confiscating weapons, ammunition, grenades, and knives. This action, however, failed to reduce fragging incidents as soldiers could easily obtain weapons in a flourishing black market among nearby Vietnamese communities. The U.S. military also attempted to diminish adverse publicity concerning fragging and the security measures it was taking to reduce it.\n\nOnly a few fraggers were identified and prosecuted. It was often difficult to distinguish between fragging and enemy action. A grenade thrown into a foxhole or tent could be a fragging, or the action of an enemy infiltrator or saboteur. Enlisted men were often close-mouthed in fragging investigations, refusing to inform on their colleagues out of fear or solidarity. Although the sentences prescribed for fragging were severe, the few men convicted often served fairly brief prison sentences. Ten fraggers were convicted of murder and served sentences ranging from ten months to thirty years with a mean prison time of about nine years.\n\nIn the Vietnam War, the threat of fragging caused many officers and NCOs to go armed in rear areas and to change their sleeping arrangements as fragging often consisted of throwing a grenade into a tent where the target was sleeping. For fear of being fragged, some leaders turned a blind eye to drug use and other indiscipline among the men in their charge. Fragging, the threat of fragging, and investigations of fragging sometimes disrupted or delayed tactical combat operations. Officers were sometimes forced to negotiate with their enlisted men to obtain their consent before undertaking dangerous patrols.\n\nThe breakdown of discipline, including fragging, was an important factor leading to the creation of an all-volunteer military force by the United States and the termination of conscription. The last conscript was inducted into the army in 1973. The volunteer military moderated some of the coercive methods of discipline previously used to maintain order in military ranks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "9038669", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9038669", "title": "Hedonic damages", "text": "Hedonic damages\n\nHedonic damages, an economic term of art, refers to loss of enjoyment of life damages, the intangible value of life, as distinct from the human capital value or lost earnings value.\n\nStan V. Smith, a Ph.D. graduate from the University of Chicago, first coined the term \"hedonic damages\" in the case of \"Sherrod v. Berry\", 827 F.2d 195 (7th Cir. 1987). and testified as an expert witness in regards to the amount of the hedonic award, the first such testimony proffered nationwide. It has since been in widespread use in subsequent legal decisions, in law review articles, and in law and economics articles nationwide. See for example Professor Cass Sunstein's University of Chicago Law & Economics, Olin Working Paper No. 340, July 2007. Such testimony has been admitted in state and federal court hundreds of times nationwide, increasingly gaining acceptance over past decades. Trained at the University of Chicago, Dr. Smith has published numerous peer-reviewed Journal articles on hedonic damages including research completed for his dissertation supervised by Nobel Laureate Gary Becker. Becker and his blog colleague Federal Appellate Judge Richard Posner both advocated the use of economic literature on the value of life in litigation. Dr. Smith also co-authored the first textbook on Hedonic Damages in 1990, published by Anderson Publishing, Ohio\n\nHedonic damages, the loss of the value of life, are allowed in almost every state in a non-fatal injury case. Based on \"William Daubert et al. v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\", and other admissibility tests, many but not all jurisdictions allow economic expert witness testimony on hedonic damages. For example, the Nevada Supreme Court unanimously approved of such testimony in \"Banks v. Sunrise Hospital\", 120 Nev. 822, 102 P.3d 52 (2004). Similarly, the 4th Appellate District in Ohio allowed such testimony based on Daubert in Lewis v. Alfa Leval,128 Ohio App.3d.200 (1998). The Court of appeals in the Lewis case held that the trial judge properly ruled that the testimony met the Daubert Standards, and that it was within the discretion of the trial court to have admitted hedonic damages testimony. The measurement of hedonic damages is based on some 40 years of extensive, well-accepted, peer-reviewed, economic research on the value of a statistical life (VSL). This measurement is controversial among forensic economists. The Value of Statistical Life literature is accepted by most forensic economists, including those economists few who oppose the admission of hedonic damages testimony. Many courts nationwide have allowed such testimony but judges have significant discretion as to its admissibility. Economists generally agree that the VSL is in the $4 million to $5 million range. This value is an average of many published results based on economic research using the Willingness-to-Pay model(WTP). Hedonic damages are not allowed in death cases in the great majority of the states. Some states do allow recovery in wrongful death cases, including New Hampshire, New Mexico, Georgia, Arkansas, Connecticut, Hawaii, and in Federal Section 1983 civil rights violation actions.\n\nHedonic damages also can apply in cases that involve no injury. Cases involving inmates wrongfully imprisoned have been won with Hedonic Damages approaches. Such were the plights of two former inmates, William Gregory and David Pope, convicted and later exonerated on rape charges. William Gregory, who served seven years in a Kentucky prison, received a $4.5 million settlement, while David Pope, who served 15 years in Texas, received $385,000. While the inmates were free, according to David Hunt, another inmate later freed after serving 18 years, \"we're still living the nightmare every day\". Hedonic damages attempt to compensate for that suffering with settlements. \n\nA person injured after falling from a defective chair was able to recover hedonic damages.\n\nEconomic testimony regarding hedonic damages has been allowed in over two thirds of the states and two thirds of the Federal District courts and has been endorsed in unanimous supreme court decisions in Nevada, New Mexico, and Mississippi and in appellate decisions in Ohio. In some states where trial judges have admitted the economic testimony a trial judge in another court may have not admitted the testimomy. The same holds true for Federal Circuit courts. Undeterred by a unimous Supreme Court decision endorsing hedonic damages testimony by an expert economist, The Mississippi legislature subsequently adopted tort reform that precludes loss of enjoyment of life testimony by economic experts. There is significant scholarship endorsing hedonic damages in personal injury and wrongful death cases. Further, Hedonic Damages were allowed as an element of recovery in the September 11, 2001 Victim Recovery Fund. Although the category of non-economic damages normally included in hedonic damage testimony was acknowledged when identifying and determining compensation for the victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks, the final determinations were not based on the methods or arguments normally presented by those experts who calculate and testify regarding hedonic damages.\n\nThe academic literature on the topic of testimony in personal injury and wrongful death cases currently (2011) reflects more a lack of controversy than implied above. In particular, despite a plea to use VSL estimates to better inform triers of fact in tort cases by Posner and Sunstein, Kip Viscusi published a retort and Thomas Ireland has published a number of articles indicating the demise of hedonic damages testimony in recent years\n\nThe WTP approach is based on measuring what people pay for safety that results in small reductions in their risk of death. For example, if average people are willing to pay $25 for a carbon monoxide detector that stands a one in two hundred thousand chance of saving their life, the WTP model would imply that such purchasers value their life at $5 million ($25 times 200,000). Economists generally use circumstances involving small risk reductions, recognizing that measuring WTP using larger risks will significantly increase the value of a statistical life.\n\n"}
{"id": "56139974", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56139974", "title": "Herman Vandenburg Ames", "text": "Herman Vandenburg Ames\n\nHerman Vandenburg Ames (; August 7, 1865 – February 7, 1935) was an American legal historian, educator, and archivist long associated with the University of Pennsylvania, where he was a professor of United States constitutional history and, from 1907 to 1928, dean of its graduate school. His 1897 monograph, \"The Proposed Amendments to the Constitution of the United States During the First Century of Its History\", was a landmark work in American constitutional history. Other works by Ames included \"John C. Calhoun and the Secession Movement of 1850\", \"Slavery and the Union 1845–1861\", and \"The X.Y.Z. Letters\", the latter of which he authored with John Bach McMaster. Among his notable students were Ezra Pound, John Musser, and Herbert Eugene Bolton.\n\nA member of the Ames family, Herman Ames was born in Massachusetts and educated at Amherst College. He received his doctorate from Harvard University, where he was the Ozias Goodwin Memorial Fellow in Constitutional and International Law, and studied under Albert Bushnell Hart. Like Hart, Ames spent time in Europe learning German historical methodology and was influenced in his own research by its approach. He was a driving force behind the establishment of the Pennsylvania State Archives and helped guide the widespread establishment of government archives throughout the United States. His papers are housed at the University of Pennsylvania's University Archives.\n\nHerman Ames was born in Lancaster, Massachusetts, in 1865 to Marcus Ames and Jane Angeline Ames (née Vandenburg).\n\nAmes' father, Marcus, was educated at Philips Andover Academy, where he graduated as valedictorian before studying medicine at Harvard Medical School. He was ordained in 1854, becoming in the words of David Ford a \"brilliant, fervent, and impressive\" Congregational preacher who ministered throughout Massachusetts, later serving as superintendent of the Lancaster Industrial School for Girls and chaplain of Rhode Island's asylum, prison, workhouse, and almshouse. Marcus Ames' parents—Herman Ames' paternal grandparents—were Azel Ames and Mercy Ames (née Hatch). Herman Ames' great grandfather, Job Ames, served in the Massachusetts Militia during the American Revolution. The Ames family descended from William Ames, who immigrated to the Province of Massachusetts Bay from the town of Bruton, England, in 1641.\n\nThe family's surname may have been a corruption of the name \"Amyas\" (meaning \"merchant of Amiens\"). In the 16th century \"Amyas\" was frequently confused with \"Ames\".\n\nAmes was educated at the Mowry and Goff School in Providence, Rhode Island. After graduating, he enrolled at Brown University before transferring to Amherst College, where he was initiated into the Delta Upsilon fraternity and later became the chapter president. During the Delta Upsilon convention of 1887, Ames played a central role in resolving an intra-fraternity dispute concerning the authority by which the Executive Council of Delta Upsilon had admitted the DePauw University chapter some months earlier. As a student at Amherst, he was particularly influenced by Anson D. Morse, whom he credited with cultivating in him \"a judicial attitude in the study of history\", years later recalling that he had \"never come in contact with a teacher who was so judicially minded\".\n\nAmes graduated from Amherst with an A.B. degree in 1888, and thereafter entered Harvard University. At Harvard he received an A.M. in 1890 and a Ph.D. the following year for his dissertation \"The Proposed Amendments to the Constitution of the United States\", which was done under the supervision of Albert Bushnell Hart. During his time at Harvard, he was\nthe Ozias Goodwin Memorial Fellow in Constitutional and International Law.\n\nBetween 1891 and 1894, Ames lectured in history at the University of Michigan under an appointment as acting assistant professor to fill a vacancy created by the resignation of J.H.T. McPherson. Though his interest was in U.S. history, at Michigan Ames was charged with teaching courses covering a variety of periods of world history, an assignment to which he would admit he was \"not particularly prepared\", but he resigned himself to the idea that \"one must make a beginning somewhere, and this was the opening offered\". He later recalled this first teaching experience \"was a valuable one to me, far more so, I fear, than to the students taught. I was afforded the opportunity to become acquainted with the life and work of the leading state university of the time\".\n\nAmes spent 1895 abroad, taking advanced studies in history at Leipzig University and Heidelberg University. During his fifteen months in Europe, he also undertook a grand tour.\n\nThe year following his return from Germany, Ames was hired as an assistant professor in the history department at Ohio State University. In 1897, he moved to the University of Pennsylvania to continue teaching history, and by 1908 had become a full professor. From 1907 to 1928, he served as dean of Pennsylvania's graduate school. As dean, Ames made his office in room 105 of College Hall, a room which he shared with the rest of the graduate school staff. Under his administration, the number of graduate students at Pennsylvania increased five-fold and, in 1923, he consulted with U.S. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes on implementing a scholarship to fund the study of diplomacy at Pennsylvania using an $80,000 endowment from the late Frederic Courtland Penfield, which was among the largest university scholarship funds in existence at that time.\n\nAt Pennsylvania, Ames established a reputation for \"tact, firmness and high ideals of scholarship\". John Musser, one of his former students and graduate assistants, recalled that Ames' relationship with his students was accessible, courteous, and helpful and that he was known for welcoming students to his home and keeping notes on their careers after they had graduated. University provost Josiah Penniman would echo Musser's assessment, stating that he knew \"of no dean who was more deeply interested in the graduate students of the University, not only those who were studying American History, but all who were studying in any courses\".\n\nDuring the 1901–02 academic year, Ames was one of Ezra Pound's instructors at Pennsylvania; Pound scholar David Ten Eyck credits him with stimulating the poet's interest in American history. Pound would later recall that Ames' \"courses had a vitality outlasting the mere time of his lectures\" and would humorously note that Ames was \"undisturbed and undistracted\" by students playing ping pong outside his office. According to Ten Eyck, studies of Pound's notes from Ames' courses indicate his \"deep interest in the subject that must have provided a foundation for [Pound's] later reflections on American history\". After Ames' death, Pound would note that—though they had no more contact than \"perhaps two or three letters\" in the ensuing decades—he continued to harbor a \"strong, personal affection\" towards Ames, citing this as proof of \"humanity overcoming all systems of invented partition\". Another notable student of Ames included Herbert Eugene Bolton.\n\nAs a scholar of legal history, his view of the United States Constitution was at once both liberal in its outlook while also guarded at attempts to meddle with its basic framework. When the eighteenth amendment, introducing prohibition of alcohol, was enacted he immediately and correctly predicted its eventual repeal.\n\nIn his view on history, Ames was both presentist and relativist; during a public lecture given at Muhlenberg College in 1909 he characterized the daily customs and behavior of early American settlers as \"barbarous\" compared to contemporary standards, and credited the growth of democracy with the development of more liberal social norms. At the same time, however, he cautioned about passing moral judgments on leaders of the past based on modern expectations. As an instructor of history, Ames was described by contemporary historian Wayne Journell as \"unabashedly\" supportive of its use to invigorate support for the government's policies during World War I, quoting him that \"it is the duty of the teacher of history and civics to seize the wonderful opportunity afforded by the war to aid in promoting an intelligent and patriotic public opinion in support of the government in these critical times\". Musser offered contradictory recollections of Ames' academic approach, describing him as having a completely objective and impartial view towards both history and current affairs and viewing with skepticism the idea that concerns such as politics or national interest should influence his teaching or research.\n\nIn the summer of 1908, Ames was a visiting lecturer at the University of Wisconsin–Madison where he taught the course \"Political and Constitutional History of the United States, 1786–1837\". He also held visiting lectureships at Columbia University and the University of California at Berkeley. Active in scholarly exchanges, Ames served on the Administrative Board of the Institute of International Education, led the Council of National Defense Philadelphia host committee during the 1920 visit of a British educational mission to the city, and represented the University of Pennsylvania to the 1909 convention of the American Association of Universities. He was the commencement speaker during the 1923 graduation exercises at New Brunswick High School in New Brunswick, New Jersey, delivering an address titled \"Preparing for Citizenship\". During the 1925 University of Pennsylvania commencement exercises, Ames and John Carew Rolfe both received honorary Doctor of Letters degrees.\n\nAfter 21 years as head of Pennsylvania's graduate school, Ames resigned his post in 1928 and was succeeded by the classicist H. Lamar Crosby. He continued his teaching duties until his death.\n\nAmes' administrative and teaching duties were an ongoing encumbrance on his research activity, limiting him to a small, albeit influential, body of work.\n\nAmes' 1897 monograph \"The Proposed Amendments to the Constitution of the United States During the First Century of Its History\", which indexed 1,736 amendments proposed to the United States Constitution, was an expansion of his doctoral dissertation. According to Ames, he had returned from his travels in Europe too late in the year to find a teaching assignment and decided to spend the ensuing months writing and researching instead.\n\nAmes' 400-page opus marked the first exhaustive catalog of proposed amendments to the U.S. Constitution ever compiled. Ames personally visited a large number of state and federal offices to record the details of the thousands of amending resolutions that had been proposed during the preceding hundred years. In discussing his research, Ames concluded that many of the amendments had failed as they were \"cures for temporary evils ... were trivial or impracticable ... [or] found a place in that unwritten constitution that has grown up side by side with the written document\". He also opined that the majorities required for ratification of amendments were so large as to create \"insurmountable constitutional obstacles\" to amendment, a frequent criticism leveled during the Progressive Era.\n\nA review of the volume in the \"Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science\" concluded it was \"a laborious and painstaking piece of work\". \"The Proposed Amendments to the Constitution of the United States During the First Century of Its History\" earned Ames the American Historical Association's Justin Winsor Prize. It was reprinted in 1970.\n\nOther works by Ames included \"John C. Calhoun and the Secession Movement of 1850\", \"Slavery and the Union 1845–1861\", and \"The X.Y.Z. Letters\", the latter of which he authored with John Bach McMaster. Ames also edited a volume of \"State Documents on Federal Relations\", a multi-issue compendium of state legislative documents pertaining to the U.S. government.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, the American Historical Association (AHA) undertook a nationwide effort to examine repositories of manuscripts and archival documents, and make specific recommendations for their future preservation. The initiative was partly influenced by Ames' advocacy of German historical methodology, learned during his year in Europe, which placed special emphasis on primary documentary sources. At the behest of the AHA, Ames spent several weeks in Harrisburg in 1899, examining Pennsylvania's state records, which were poorly organized and largely scattered across various state offices. He co-authored, with historian Lewis Slifer Shimmel, a report on their status, and in 1900 filed a separate report on the state of the Philadelphia municipal archives. Their report concluded that over the years Pennsylvania's public records had been partially plundered by government officials with some state documents known to be held by libraries in New York and Boston, and others probably once bearing the original signature of William Penn had since had their signature lines cut out, perhaps for souvenir keeping. Ames continued his attempts to inventory Pennsylvania public records in tandem with his teaching duties at the University of Pennsylvania, although his efforts were hampered by the tradition that all state government offices closed promptly at 3 o'clock in the afternoon.\n\nAmes and Shimmel ended their work with several recommendations. First, they advised that original manuscripts, where they could be found, be printed and bound to guarantee the preservation of their contents even if the original records became destroyed, lost, or stolen. Second, they called for storing documents in steel—rather than wooden—filing cabinets as a fireproofing measure. Finally, they called for the cataloging and centralization of important historical documents. In 1903, at the behest of Pennsylvania governor Samuel W. Pennypacker, himself a noted historian, Ames and Shimmel's recommendations were realized and the Pennsylvania State Archives formally established.\n\nAmes continued his advocacy of archival preservation as a member of the AHA's Public Archives Commission, serving as its chair from 1903 to 1913, and continuing as a member for many years thereafter. By 1904, the commission had secured the services of historians in 32 states to study the status of public records and in 1907 Ames authored a detailed status report regarding archival preservation legislation throughout the United States, which would later be credited as the first report of its kind. Two years later, in 1909, Ames organized the first national conference of American government archivists.\n\nWith his well-established expertise on archival issues, J. Franklin Jameson called on Ames to give testimony to the United States Senate Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds as he lobbied for the creation of the National Archives of the United States. In February 1912, Jameson wrote Ames to ask him to \"lay before the committee whatever there has been in the practice or experience of states that deserves attention by persons who are planning a national building\". Ames' prior commitment to attend the quasquicentennial celebrations of the University of Pittsburgh ultimately prevented him from traveling to Washington for the hearing. Still, Jameson continued to correspond with Ames seeking advice relating to the politics and impediments he had experienced in advocating for the creation of state archives.\n\nAmes served as corresponding secretary of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, and was elected to the American Antiquarian Society. He also served as president of the History Teachers' Association of the Middle States and Maryland. In 1918 he was appointed—along with John Bach McMaster, Hampton Carson, William Cameron Sproul, and others—to the Pennsylvania War History Commission, which was formed to preserve records related to Pennsylvania's participation in World War I.\n\nAmes had planned his retirement for 1936, and was intending to spend his final year at Pennsylvania laying the groundwork for two new research projects: a biography of Robert J. Walker, and a study of the presidential veto power.\n\nNeither of Ames' two planned projects bore fruit; he died at his home at 203 St. Mark's Square in Philadelphia on February 7, 1935, from a cerebral hemorrhage following a stroke. Funeral services were held at the Second Presbyterian Church of Philadelphia, with Thomas Sovereign Gates, Roland Sletor Morris, Emory Richard Johnson, Conyers Read, Roy Franklin Nichols, Lewis M. Stevens, Julian P. Boyd, H. Lamar Crosby, and Edward Cheyney serving as honorary pallbearers.\n\nOn May 7, 1935, three months after his death, a memorial meeting was held at Houston Hall in which Ames was eulogized by his colleagues and former students. A record of these speeches, along with letters contributed by those who could not attend—including his doctoral supervisor Albert Bushnell Hart—was compiled and edited by Edward Cheyney and Roy Franklin Nichols. The compilation was published by the University of Pennsylvania Press in 1936 as the 31-page \"Memorial: Herman Vandenburg Ames\".\n\nAmes was unmarried.

The equity purchaser needs the equity seller's permission to resell the property to anyone else for so long as the equity seller has a right to buy the property back.\n\nEither (i) title to the property must eventually be reconveyed to the equity seller; or (ii) the equity purchaser must have paid seller at least 82% of the fair market value of the property within 120 days of the eviction or voluntary relinquishment by the equity seller.\n\nThe equity purchaser must confirm that the equity seller has the \"reasonable ability\" to buy back the property and the deed must recite that the property is subject to reconveyance and the terms of the reconveyance arrangement.\n\nOnce a contract is determined to be covered by the Act, there are some strict contractual requirements that must be met:\n\nThe contract must contain the entire agreement between the parties and must meet the following format requirements:\nContract must be fully completed (i.e., no blank spaces); Font size equal to at least 12-point bold type; In English or in both English or Spanish if Spanish is the primary language of the equity seller; Name, address and phone number of the buyer; Address of the subject property; Consideration to be paid; List of all services that buyer has promised; Terms for payment of the consideration; Time at which possession of the property must be surrendered; Terms of any rental or lease agreement; Terms of any reconveyance agreement; Notice of right to cancellation in the immediate proximity of signature line and font in at least 14-point bold type (form in HEPTA); and Notice of cancellation form to be attached to the contract (form in HEPTA)\n\nAny provision which purports to limit the liability of the equity purchaser shall be null and void. Inclusion of such a provision shall, at the option of the equity seller, render the covered contract void. Any provision which purports to require arbitration shall be void at the option of the equity seller. Any waiver of any or all HEPTA shall be void and unenforceable as contrary to the public policy.\n\nThe Act also gives the equity seller a five-day right to cancel the contract; a \"cooling off\" period. Once an equity seller cancels the contract by sending the cancellation form or otherwise indicating such an intention, the equity purchaser must return all original contracts and other documents signed by the equity seller within 10 days, as well as any fee or other consideration received by the equity purchaser from the equity seller. Cancellation of the contract releases the equity seller of all obligations to pay fees to the equity purchaser.\n\nBefore midnight on the 5th business day after the contract is executed, the equity purchaser cannot: Accept a deed; Record any document with the county clerk; Transfer any interest in the residence; Pay the equity seller any consideration; Suggest that the equity seller waive his/her right to cancel or rescind.\n\nThe equity purchaser is prohibited from representing (directly or indirectly) that: Equity purchaser is an advisor or acting on behalf of the equity seller; Equity purchaser has certification that buyer actually does not have or that buyer is not a member of a licensed profession when he actually is a member of that profession; Equity purchaser is helping the equity seller \"save\" the residence, unless equity purchaser has a good faith basis for such representation; or Equity purchaser is helping the equity seller in preventing a foreclosure unless the equity purchaser has a good faith basis for such representation\n\nAn equity purchaser shall make no false or misleading statement regarding: The value of the property; The amount of proceeds the equity seller will receive after a foreclosure sale; The timing of the judicial foreclosure process; Any contract term\nThe equity seller's rights and obligations; The nature of any document which the equity purchaser induces the equity seller to sign; Any other false or misleading statement concerning the sale of the property or concerning a reconveyance arrangement\n\nThe equity purchaser is prohibited from making any contract that takes unconscionable advantage of the equitable seller.\n\n2-Year Right of Rescission - Generally, a violation of the contractual requirements or any of the prohibited acts in Subdivision 7 makes the conveyance voidable and may be rescinded within 2 years of the date the deed was recorded. The statute then gives the equity purchaser (or its successor) twenty days to reconvey the property on the condition of repayment of any consideration paid to the equity seller. HEPTA does not affect the rights of a bona-fide purchaser or encumbrancer for value if their conveyance occurred before the recording of the notice of rescission.\n\n6-Year Statute of Limitations - Within 6 years, an equity seller may bring an action for the recovery of damages or equitable relief against an equity purchaser for a violation of HEPTA. A court may award actual damages plus reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. The court is also authorized to award equitable relief of up to 3 times the actual damages.\n\nThere are also criminal penalties for violation of prohibited behavior listed in Subdivision 7:\n\nViolation \"with intent to defraud\" = class E felony, subject to imprisonment and a fine of not more than $25,000. \"Knowingly violates\" = Class A misdemeanor, subject to a fine of not more than $25,000 and imprisonment in accordance with the penal law, or both.\n\nA mortgage broker or bank making a loan with knowledge that the equity purchaser is not complying with HEPTA is subject to penalties under Banking Law §595-a. These criminal penalties are in addition to the risk that the equity seller will rescind and thereby jeopardize the encumbrancer's interest in the property.\n\nThose who acquire title as follows are excluded from HETPA:\n\n(i) To use, and then actually uses, the property as his/her primary residence;\n\n(ii) By a deed from a referee in a foreclosure sale;\n\n(iii) At any sale of property authorized by statute;\n\n(iv) By order or judgment of any court;\n\n(v) From a spouse, or from a parent, grandparent, child, grandchild or sibling of such person or such person's spouse;\n\n(vi) As a not-for-profit housing organization or as a public housing agency; or\n\nWhat is a Bona Fide Purchaser? One who (i) acts in good faith; (ii) purchases for valuable consideration or provide a mortgage; (iii) has no notice of the equity seller's continuing right to, or equity in, the property prior to the acquisition of title or encumbrance; (iv) has no notice of any violation of HETPA by the equity purchaser as related to the property. Generally, this is one who either purchases from or provides a loan to the equity purchaser.\n\nAn equity purchaser has a defense to a violation of Subdivision 7 if he/she (i) acted in good faith; (ii) proves that the violation was not intentional (iii) proves that the violation resulted from a bona fide error despite procedures adapted to avoid such errors; (iv) notifies the equity seller within ninety days of the contract date of the compliance failure; Makes appropriate restitution within ninety days of the contract date.\n\nExamples of bona fide errors include clerical, calculation, computer malfunction and programming, and printing errors. An error of legal judgment is NOT a bona fide error, nor is a failure to provide notices or other material information.\n\nThere is some confusion as to whether HEPTA applies to deeds in lieu of foreclosure since there is no clear exclusion as there is for referee deeds, for example. The 2-year right of rescission is not a risk that banks or title insurers are comfortable with, especially given the complexities of compliance, so many banks and title insurers are not willing to work with deeds in lieu.\n"}

State wildlife agencies that sell hunting licenses are the best source of information regarding hunting seasons, areas open/closed to hunting, etc. Hunting of migratory birds such as ducks and geese is managed cooperatively by state fish and wildlife agencies and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Migratory waterfowl hunters must possess both a state hunting license and a Federal Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp (Duck Stamp), and each hunter needs a Harvest Information Program (HIP) number for each state in which they hunt migratory birds.\n\nOpen season is the time of the year when a particular wildlife species is allowed to be hunted as per local wildlife conservation law. Each state creates laws and codes governing the season dates and species, based on a complex process including citizen input, a state fish and game agency or department, and often an independent game council. This process updates a game code for each state which outlines all rules and regulations including hunting seasons. In each of the 50 states, abstracts of the larger game code are then presented in the official state hunting regulations for that given year. Season dates are often timed to occur when the population is at its maximum. It avoids the peak breeding period when members of a species are particularly vulnerable, and avoids any disruption to mating, which may affect productivity.\n\nClosed season is the time of the year during which hunting an animal of a given species is contrary to law. Typically, closed seasons are designed to protect a species when it is most vulnerable or, sometimes, to protect animals during their breeding season.\n\nThe closed season is timed to prevent hunting during times of peak reproductive activity, impaired flying ability during moulting (of game birds such as waterfowl), and temperature extremes, low population levels and food shortage.\n\nA closed season is enforced by local conservation law for the conservation of the species and wildlife management; any hunting during closed season is punishable by law and termed as illegal hunting or poaching.\n"}

It is this system that regulates state actions under international law. The principal subjects of international law are states, rather than individuals as they are under municipal law. The International Court of Justice acknowledged in the \"Reparation for Injuries\" case that types of international legal personality other than statehood could exist and that the past half century has seen a significant expansion of the subjects of international law. Apart from states, international legal personality is also possessed by international organisations and, in some circumstance, human beings. In addition, non-governmental organisations and national liberation movements have also been said to possess international legal personality.\n\nSince 1945 the international legal system has been dominated by the United Nations and the structures that were established as part of that organisation. While the UN has been the object of significant criticism, it has nevertheless played a pivotal role both in the progressive development and codification of international law.\n\nThe General Assembly of the UN has sponsored and promoted some of the most important developments of the last fifty years through the adoption of multilateral treaties and instruments. The Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982 and the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969 are two of the most prominent examples.\n\nA significant role in the legal work of the UN is played by the Sixth Committee (Legal), one of the six committees of the General Assembly.

()), was a Taiwanese manufacturer of cartridges, accessories and original games for NES and Famicom. For both they also manufactured converters to play Famicom titles on the NES. The company was founded in 1983 (according to the Asder official website), but in the 80's its activities were and are still today unknown.\n\nNTDEC gained notoriety in the early 1990s for their large-scale piracy of Nintendo Entertainment System games along with their unauthorized use of the Nintendo trademark. This led to the arrest of a few of their employees and the discontinuation of the NTDEC line.\n\nNTDEC produced a large number of unlicensed video game copies between 1989 and 1991, which were sold in Asia and in the United States via mail order. Unusual among counterfeit cartridge manufacturers, they're often identifiable through the company logo on it and the in-game copyright notice modified to read \"NTDEC\", as well as the rear label featuring a green stripe.\n\nTwo NTDEC employees were arrested in 1991 for the company's activities distributing cartridges in the US, and legal action was brought against the company by Nintendo shortly after for copyright infringement, as well as its use of the \"Nintendo\" trademark in its company name.\n\nNintendo's legal action of 1991 concluded in 1993 with Nintendo being awarded $24,059,062 plus attorneys fees of $108,829.00 and costs of $709.80, and a worldwide permanent injunction preventing NTDEC from infringing Nintendo's intellectual property rights. At this point the company ceased operations under the NTDEC name.\n\nBetween 1991 and 1993, NTDEC developed and published a number of original games in Asia, some of which were distributed in parts of South America and Europe. Many of these were credited to Mega Soft, a California-based company which was listed in \"Nintendo of America, Inc. v. NTDEC\" as their North American distribution arm. Six games previously released by them in 1991 were compiled on the \"Caltron 6 in 1\" multicart in 1992, which was distributed in the United States - since this cartridge contains only NTDEC/Mega Soft games and carries the same CN-xx ID as the previous original NTDEC games; Caltron (or Caltron Ind. Inc.) is believed to be the same company as NTDEC.\n\n\nFollowing the legal action of 1993, the company appears to have ceased operations under the NTDEC name. Another Taiwanese company, Asder Electronic Co., Ltd (), has released educational computer systems and TV game joypads containing Mega Soft games, and several original Famicom games continuing NTDEC's CN-xx numbering. However, it's unknown whether this company is NTDEC with a new name, or a separate company that obtained the rights to past titles from them.\n\nNote: The title Master Shooter, included only in \"Asder 20-in-1\", is the hack of the game of the same name (listed in the same compilation as Shooter: Part1).\n\n"}
{"id": "4770865", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4770865", "title": "National Library of the Philippines", "text": "National Library of the Philippines\n\nThe National Library of the Philippines ( or \"Aklatang Pambansa ng Pilipinas\", abbreviated NLP) is the official national library of the Philippines. The complex is located in Ermita on a portion of Rizal Park facing T.M. Kalaw Avenue, neighboring culturally significant buildings such as the Museum of Philippine Political History and the National Historical Commission. Like its neighbors, it is under the jurisdiction of the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA).\n\nThe library is notable for being the home of the original copies of the defining works of José Rizal: \"Noli Me Tangere\", \"El Filibusterismo\" and \"Mi último adiós\".\n\nThe National Library of the Philippines can trace its history to the establishment of the \"Museo-Biblioteca de Filipinas\" (Museum-Library of the Philippines), established by a royal order of the Spanish government on August 12, 1887. It opened on October 24, 1891 at the Intendencia in Intramuros, then home of the Manila Mint (as the \"Casa de la Moneda\"), with around 100 volumes and with both Julian Romero and Benito Perdiguero as director and archivist-librarian, respectively.\n\nRomero resigned in 1893 and was briefly replaced by Tomas Torres of the \"Escuela de Artes y Ofícios\" in Bacolor, Pampanga (now the Don Honorio Ventura Technological State University), who in turn was replaced by Don Pedro A. Paterno on March 31, 1894. By that time, the library had moved to a site in Quiapo near the present site of the Masjid Al-Dahab. Later on, Paterno published the first issue of the \"Boletin del Museo-Biblioteca de Filipinas\" (Bulletin of the Museum-Library of the Philippines) on January 15, 1895.\n\nThe \"Museo-Biblioteca\" was abolished upon the onset of the American colonization of the Philippines. By the time of its abolition, the library held around 1,000 volumes and averaged around 25–30 visitors a day. The entire collection would later be transferred at Paterno's expense to his own private library, of which some books would form the basis for the Filipiniana collection of subsequent incarnations of the National Library.\n\nAs the Philippine–American War died down and peace gradually returned to the Philippines, Americans who had come to settle in the islands saw the need for a wholesome recreational outlet. Recognizing this need, Mrs. Charles Greenleaf and several other American women organized the American Circulating Library (ACL), dedicated in memory of American soldiers who died in the Philippine–American War. The ACL opened on March 9, 1900 with 1,000 volumes donated by the Red Cross Society of California and other American organizations. By 1901, the ACL's collection grew to 10,000 volumes, consisting mostly of American works of fiction, periodicals and newspapers. The rapid expansion of the library proved to be such a strain on the resources of the American Circulating Library Association of Manila, the organization running the ACL, that it was decided that the library's entire collection should be donated to the government.\n\nThe Philippine Commission formalized the acceptance of the ACL's collections on March 5, 1901 through Act No. 96, today observed as the birthdate of both the National Library and the Philippine public library system. With the ACL now a Philippine government institution, a board of trustees and three personnel, led by librarian Nelly Y. Egbert, were appointed by the colonial government. At the same time, the library moved to Rosario Street (now Quintin Paredes Street) in Binondo before its expansion warranted its move up the street to the Hotel de Oriente on Plaza Calderón de la Barca in 1904. It was noted in the 1905 annual report of the Department of Public Instruction (the current Department of Education) that the new location \"was not exactly spacious but at least it was comfortable and accessible by tramway from almost every part of the city\". At the same time, the ACL, acting on its mandate to make its collections available to American servicemen stationed in the Philippines, established five traveling libraries, serving various, if not unusual, clientele across the islands. In November 1905, Act No. 1407 placed the library under the Bureau of Education and subsequently moved to its headquarters at the corner of Cabildo (now Muralla) and Recoletos Streets in Intramuros, on which today the offices of the \"Manila Bulletin\" stand.\n\nOn June 2, 1908, Act No. 1849 was passed, mandating the consolidation of all government libraries in the Philippines into the ACL. Subsequently, Act No. 1935 was passed in 1909, renaming the ACL the Philippine Library and turning it into an autonomous body governed by a five-member Library Board. At the same time, the Act mandated the division of the library into four divisions: the law, scientific, circulating and Filipiniana divisions. The newly renamed library was headed by James Alexander Robertson, an American scholar who, in collaboration with Emma Helen Blair, wrote \"The Philippine Islands, 1493–1898\", and recognized today as both the first director of the modern National Library and the father of Philippine library science. Robertson would later abolish the library's subscription fees for books in general circulation in 1914.\n\nAct No. 2572, passed on January 31, 1916, merged the Philippine Library with two other government institutions: the Division of Archives, Patents, Copyrights and Trademarks (later to become the National Archives, the Copyright Office of the National Library and the Intellectual Property Office) and the Law Library of the Philippine Assembly, forming the Philippine Library and Museum. In addition, the Philippine Library and Museum was placed under the supervision of the Department of Justice. However, on December 7, 1928, Act No. 3477 was passed, splitting the Philippine Library and Museum into the National Library and the National Museum (now the National Museum of the Philippines). The newly formed National Library was placed under the supervision of the Philippine Assembly, subsequently moving to the Legislative Building on Padre Burgos Street in Ermita. This arrangement continued with the convocation of the National Assembly at the dawn of the Commonwealth era in 1935. However, supervision of the National Library would return to the Department of Public Instruction in 1936.\n\nThe dawn of World War II and the subsequent invasion of the Philippines by the Japanese had no significant impact on the National Library, with the institution still remaining open and the government at the time making few significant changes to the library, such as the abolition of the Research and Bibliography Division and the subsequent suspension of work on the national bibliography in 1941. However, by late 1944, with the impending campaign of combined American and Filipino forces to recapture the Philippines, Japanese forces stationed in Manila began setting up fortifications in large buildings, including the Legislative Building. Despite the occupation of the Legislative Building, the Japanese commanding officer permitted library officials to vacate the premises within two weeks of their occupation, with the library subsequently moving into the building housing the Philippine Normal School (now the Philippine Normal University). Two weeks later, however, Japanese troops also moved to occupy that building as well, with the same commanding officer giving library officials only until that afternoon to vacate the premises. All collections of the National Library were moved into a 1.5-cubic meter vault under the Manila City Hall, the closest building at the time. However, most of the library's Filipiniana collection, having been overlooked by moving staff and due to time constraints, was left behind at the Philippine Normal School.\n\nThe Battle of Manila would prove to be disastrous to the cultural patrimony of the Philippines and the collections of the National Library in particular. Most of the library's collections were either destroyed by fires as a result of the ensuing battle between American, Filipino and Japanese forces, lost or stolen by looters afterward. Pieces lost from the library's collections included an urn where Andrés Bonifacio's remains were stored, as well as valuable Filipiniana pieces such as some of the manuscripts of José Rizal. Of the 733,000 volumes the library had in its collections prior to World War II, only 36,600 remained. However, luckily for library officials, a locked box containing the \"crown jewels\" of the National Library: the original copies of Rizal's \"Noli Me Tangere\", \"El Filibusterismo\" and \"Mi último adiós\", was left intact. Tiburcio Tumaneng, then the chief of the Filipiniana Division, described the event as a happy occasion.\n\nWord of the books' discovery by Tumaneng was relayed to Professor H. Otley Beyer, then chairman of the Committee on Salvage of Government Libraries, through officer-in-charge Luis Montilla. Having found a new sense of optimism after the books' discovery, Beyer and a group of volunteers began scouring the ruins of the Legislative Building and the Philippine Normal School for any and all books they could find. However, much to their surprise, the entire collection stored under Manila City Hall disappeared, lost to looters who ransacked the ruins of public buildings. All salvaged materials were brought back to Beyer's residence on Aviles Street, near Malacañan Palace.\n\nWith the return of Commonwealth rule, the National Library reopened and relocated to the site of the Old Bilibid Prison (today the Manila City Jail) on Oroquieta Street in Santa Cruz while the Legislative Building was being restored. In addition, it also sought the assistance of friendly countries to rebuild its collections. According to Concordia Sanchez in her book \"The Libraries of the Philippines\", many countries, mainly the United States, donated many thousands of books, although some were outdated and others were too foreign for Filipino readers to understand. Although rebuilding the General Reference and Circulation Divisions was easy, rebuilding the Filipiniana Division was the hardest of all.\n\nIn 1947, one year after the independence of the Philippines from the United States, President Manuel Roxas signed Executive Order No. 94, converting the National Library into an office under the Office of the President called the Bureau of Public Libraries. The name change was done reportedly out of a sense of national shame as a result of World War II, with Roxas preferring to emphasize the library's administrative responsibilities over its cultural and historical functions. Although the library was offered its original headquarters in the newly-rebuilt Legislative Building, the newly convened Congress of the Philippines forced it to relocate to the old Legislative Building at the corner of Lepanto (now Loyola) and P. Paredes Streets in Sampaloc, near the current campus of the University of the East. The Circulation Division, originally meant to cater to the residents of the city of Manila, was abolished in 1955 after it was determined that the city's residents were already adequately served by the four libraries under the supervision of the Manila city government. That same year, it was forced to relocate to the Arlegui Mansion in San Miguel, then occupied by the Department of Foreign Affairs.\n\nDuring this time, much of the library's Filipiniana collection was gradually restored. In 1953, two folders of Rizaliana (works pertaining to José Rizal) previously in the possession of a private Spanish citizen which contained, among others, Rizal's transcript of records, a letter from his mother, Teodora Alonso, and a letter from his wife, Josephine Bracken, were returned by the Spanish government as a gesture of friendship and goodwill. Likewise, the 400,000-piece Philippine Revolutionary Papers (PRP), also known as the Philippine Insurgent Records (PIR), were returned by the United States in 1957.\n\nAfter many moves throughout its history, the National Library finally moved to its present location on June 19, 1961, in commemoration of the 100th birthday of José Rizal. It was renamed back to the National Library on June 18, 1964, by virtue of Republic Act No. 3873.\n\nAlthough no major changes occurred in the National Library immediately after its relocation, two significant events took place in the 1970s: first, the issuance of Presidential Decree No. 812 on October 18, 1975, which allowed the National Library to exercise the right of legal deposit, and second, the resumption of work on the Philippine National Bibliography (PNB) which had been suspended since 1941. For this purpose, the library acquired its first mainframe computer and likewise trained library staff in its use with the assistance of both UNESCO and the Technology and Livelihood Resource Center. The first edition of the PNB was published in 1977 using simplified MARC standards, and subsequently updated ever since. The library subsequently purchased three microcomputers in the 1980s and, through a Japanese grant, acquired three IBM PS/2 computers and microfilming and reprographics equipment. The Library for the Blind Division was organized in 1988 and subsequently launched in 1994.\n\nScandal arose in September 1993 when it was discovered that a researcher from the National Historical Institute (now the National Historical Commission of the Philippines), later identified as Rolando Bayhon, was pilfering rare documents from the library's collections. According to some library employees, the pilfering of historical documents dates back to the 1970s, when President Ferdinand Marcos began writing a book on Philippine history titled \"Tadhana\" (Destiny), using as references library materials which were subsequently not returned. Having suspected widespread pilferage upon assuming the directorship in 1992, then-Director Adoracion B. Mendoza sought the assistance of the National Bureau of Investigation in recovering the stolen items. Some 700 items were recovered from an antique shop in Ermita and Bayhon was arrested. Although convicted of theft in July 1996, Bayhon was sentenced \"in absentia\" and still remains at large. The chief of the Filipiniana Division at the time, Maria Luisa Moral, who was believed to be involved in the scandal, was dismissed on September 25, but subsequently acquitted on May 29, 2008. Following Bayhon's arrest, Mendoza made several appeals calling on the Filipino people to return items pilfered from the library's collections without criminal liability. Around eight thousand documents, including the original copy of the Philippine Declaration of Independence among others, were subsequently returned to the library by various persons, including some six thousand borrowed by a professor of the University of the Philippines.\n\nIn 1995, the National Library launched its local area network, consisting of a single file server and four workstations, and subsequently its online public access catalog (named Basilio, after the character in Rizal's novels) in 1998, as well as its website on March 15, 2001. Following the retirement of Mendoza in 2001, Prudenciana C. Cruz was appointed director and has overseen the continued computerization of its facilities, including the opening of the library's Internet room on July 23, 2001. That same year, the library began digitization of its collections, with an initial 52,000 pieces converted into a digital format. This digitization was one of the factors which led to the birth of the Philippine eLibrary, a collaboration between the National Library and the University of the Philippines, the Department of Science and Technology, the Department of Agriculture and the Commission on Higher Education, which was launched on February 4, 2004 as the Philippines' first digital library. The Philippine President's Room, a section of the Filipiniana Division dedicated to works and documents pertaining to Philippine presidents, was opened on July 7, 2007.\n\nOn September 26, 2007, the National Library was reorganized into nine divisions per its rationalization plan. In 2010, Republic Act No. 10078 was signed, renaming the National Library to the National Library of the Philippines.\n\nIn 1954, President Ramon Magsaysay issued an executive order forming the José Rizal National Centennial Commission, entrusted with the duty of \"erecting a grand monument in honor of José Rizal in the capital of the Philippines\". The Commission then decided to erect a cultural complex in Rizal Park with a new building housing the National Library as its centerpiece, a memorial to Rizal as an advocate of education. To finance the construction of the new National Library building, the Commission conducted a nationwide public fundraising campaign, the donors being mostly schoolchildren, who were encouraged to donate ten centavos to the effort, and library employees, who each donated a day's salary. Because of this effort by the Commission, the National Library of the Philippines is said to be the only national library in the world built mostly out of private donations, and the only one built out of veneration to its national hero at the time of its construction.\n\nConstruction on the building's foundation began on March 23, 1960 and the superstructure on September 16. During construction, objections were raised over the library's location, claiming that the salinity of the air around Manila Bay would hasten the destruction of the rare books and manuscripts that would be stored there. Despite the objections, construction still continued, and the new building was inaugurated on June 19, 1961, Rizal's 100th birthday, by President Carlos P. Garcia, Magsaysay's successor.\n\nThe current National Library building, a six-storey, edifice, was designed by Hexagon Associated Architects and constructed at a cost of 5.5 million pesos. With a total floor area of , the library has three reading rooms and three mezzanines which currently occupy the western half of the second, third and fourth floors. Each reading room can accommodate up to 532 readers, or 1,596 in total for the entire building. The 400-seat Epifanio de los Santos Auditorium and a cafeteria are located on the sixth floor. There are also provisions for administrative offices, a fumigation room, an air-conditioned photography laboratory and printing room, two music rooms and an exhibition hall. The library's eight stack rooms have a total combined capacity of one million volumes with ample room for expansion. In addition to two staircases connecting all six floors, the National Library building is equipped with a single elevator, servicing the first four floors.\n\nPart of the National Library building's west wing is occupied by the National Archives.\n\nThe collections of the National Library of the Philippines consist of more than 210,000 books; over 880,000 manuscripts, all part of the Filipiniana Division; more than 170,000 newspaper issues from Metro Manila and across the Philippines; some 66,000 theses and dissertations; 104,000 government publications; 3,800 maps and 53,000 photographs. The library's collections include large numbers of materials stored on various forms of non-print media, as well as almost 18,000 pieces for use of the Library for the Blind Division.\n\nOverall, the National Library has over 1.6 million pieces in its collections, one of the largest among Philippine libraries. Accounted in its collections include valuable \"Rizaliana\" pieces, four incunabula, the original manuscript of \"Lupang Hinirang\" (the National Anthem), several sets of \"The Philippine Islands, 1493-1898\", a collection of rare Filipiniana books previously owned by the Compañía General de Tabacos de Filipinas, and the documents of five Philippine Presidents. The most prized possessions of the National Library, which include Rizal's \"Noli Me Tangere\", \"El Filibusterismo\" and \"Mi último adiós\", three of his unfinished novels and the Philippine Declaration of Independence, are kept in a special double-combination vault at the rare documents section of the Filipiniana Division's reading room.\n\nA significant portion of the National Library's collections are composed of donations and works obtained through both legal deposit and copyright deposit due to the limited budget allocated for the purchase of library materials; the 2007 national budget allocation for the library allocated less than ten million pesos for the purchase of new books. The library also relies on its various donors and exchange partners, which numbered 115 in 2007, for expanding and diversifying its collections. The lack of a sufficient budget has affected the quality of the library's offerings: the Library for the Blind suffers from a shortage of books printed in braille, while the manuscripts of Rizal's masterpieces have reportedly deteriorated due to the lack of funds to support 24-hour air conditioning to aid in its preservation. In 2011, Rizal's manuscripts were restored with the help from German specialist. Major documents in the National Library of the Philippines, along with the National Archives of the Philippines, have great potential to be included in the UNESCO Memory of the World Register according to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.\n\n"}

{"id": "37423356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37423356", "title": "Post conviction", "text": "Post conviction\n\nIn law, post-conviction refers to the legal process which takes place after a trial results in conviction of the defendant. After conviction, a court will proceed with sentencing the guilty party. In the criminal justice system, once a defendant has received a guilty verdict, he or she can then challenge a conviction or sentence. This takes place through different legal actions, known as filing an appeal or a federal habeas corpus proceeding. The goal of these proceedings is exoneration, or proving a convicted person innocent. If lacking representation, the defendant may consult or hire an attorney to exercise his or her legal rights.\n\nThe post-conviction process is in place to protect innocent individuals from inherent human error in the criminal justice system. One study cites 10,000 innocent people are convicted each year in the United States.\n\nThe appeals process is the request for a formal change of a decision made by a court of law. The litigant who files the appeal is known as the \"appellant.\" A successful appeal must demonstrate to a higher court that the trial court made a decision affected by legal error. The appellate procedure in the United States takes place in appellate court, and that court normally makes its judgment based only on the record of the original case. The appellant generally submits a document of legal arguments called a \"brief,\" a written attempt to persuade the judges of appellate court that the decision of the trial court should be reversed. If selected for an \"oral argument,\" appellants may present a short spoken argument to the court. No additional pieces of evidence or witnesses are considered.\n\nThe ruling made by the appellate court is usually final. \nThe decision of the appellate court generally affirms the original decision of the trial court. However, 10-20% of civil and criminal appeals are successful in reversing the decision of the original trial. If the appeals process is unsuccessful, a convicted person may pursue other options, depending upon the severity of his or her sentence and the crime committed.\n\nWrits are directives from a higher court to a lower court or government official, and are only issued when the one seeking the writ (the moving party) has no other options. Most states in the United States allow convicted parties to file several specific writs (legal actions). These writs require that the detainee be considered by a judge or court, and are in place to prevent unconstitutional imprisonment.\n\nAlso known as the \"great writ' Habeas Corpus writs are most common. Many countries, including the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Canada have adopted the practice from English common law. Habeas corpus is a judicial mandate to a prison official which orders that an inmate be brought to trial to determine whether the imprisonment is lawful and if it should continue. Typically, an inmate will argue that his imprisonment is unconstitutional. While habeas corpus can be filed in state or federal court, all state avenues must be exhausted first.\n\nIn the United States federal court system the writ of habeas corpus is used most frequently to review state court convictions. Federal statutes (28 U.S.C. §§ 2241–2256) outline the procedural aspects of federal habeas corpus proceedings. Additionally, the Supreme Court of the United States may use the certiorari writ to review United States Courts of Appeals cases or cases from state courts. Error coram nobis is another writ issued only rarely at the federal level in cases of federal criminal convictions when \"no other remedy is available.\" This process is similar to the state writ process, though inmates must consume all state appeals and writ options before moving forward. This is an important part of the legal strategy, especially for those inmates who have legitimate claims.\n\nCases that involve the death penalty are especially significant in the post conviction stage. These inmates will often file numerous appeals to courts at every level. In these unique cases, inmates can file an appeal which could potentially be reviewed by the United States Supreme Court. The court has the ability to stay the execution if some legal flaw in the original trial comes to light. The Court does not often exercise this power, though several individuals from around the world sentenced with capital punishment have been exonerated in the past thirty years.\n\nInmates in this position can also file for clemency or pardon. Practices vary from state to state, but the clemency process usually requires the governor or board of advisors or both. Since 1976 273 death row inmates have been granted clemency for humanitarian reasons. These include doubts about the petitioner's guilt or a governor's personal stance on capital punishment.\n\nOverturning a conviction after dozens of appeals and petitions have been denied is notoriously difficult, though prisoners have some options at their disposal. They can still attain freedom if legitimate innocence can be proven. The most common method is by using DNA evidence to disprove a crime that happened before DNA testing was a viable option. The Innocence Project, founded to exonerate those convicted wrongfully, has found more than 300 post-conviction DNA exonerations in the history of the United States. Attorneys can file a motion to introduce strong new evidence to the courts. Other common innocence efforts center on victim recantations if applicable.\n\nThe external links below offered insights in the construction of this article:\n\n"}
{"id": "386661", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=386661", "title": "Product key", "text": "Product key\n\nA product key, also known as a software key, is a specific software-based key for a computer program. It certifies that the copy of the program is original. Activation is sometimes done offline by entering the key, or with software like Windows 8.1, online activation is required to prevent multiple people using the same key. Not all software has a product key, as some publishers may choose to use a different method to protect their copyright, or in some cases, such as free or open source software, copyright protection is not used.\n\nComputer games use product keys to verify that the game has not been copied without authorization. Likewise, one is not allowed to play online with two identical product keys at the same time.\n\nProduct keys consist of a series of numbers and/or letters. This sequence is typically entered by the user during the installation of computer software, and is then passed to a verification function in the program. This function manipulates the key sequence according to a mathematical algorithm and attempts to match the results to a set of valid solutions.\n\nStandard key generation, where product keys are generated mathematically, is not completely effective in stopping copyright infringement of software, as these keys can be distributed. The overall effectiveness of product keys in enforcing software copyrights requires further study. In addition, with improved communication from the rise of the Internet, more sophisticated attacks on keys such as cracks (removing the need for a key) and product key generators have become common.\n\nBecause of this, software publishers are increasingly turning to alternative methods of verifying that keys are both valid and uncompromised. One method, product validation, assigns a product key based on a unique feature of the purchaser's computer hardware (such as its MAC address), which cannot be as easily duplicated since it depends on the user's hardware. Other newer methods may involve requiring periodical validation of the CD key with an internet server (for games with an online component, this is done whenever the user signs in). The validation can then be performed on the server side, preventing cracks tampering with it (as they do on the client side). The server can also keep a blacklist of all CD keys known to be invalid or which have explicitly been banned, and deny them access.\n\nSome of the most effective CD key protection is very controversial, due to inconvenience, strict enforcement, harsh penalties and, in some cases, false positives. CD key protection has been linked to Digital Rights Management, in that it uses uncompromising digital procedures to enforce the license agreement.\n\nProduct keys are somewhat inconvenient for end users. Not only do they need to be entered whenever a program is installed, but the user must also be sure not to lose them. Loss of a product key usually means the software is useless once uninstalled.\n\nProduct keys also present new ways for distribution to go wrong. If a product is shipped with missing or invalid keys, then the CD itself is useless. For example, all copies of \"\" originally shipped to Australia without CD keys.\n\nThere are many cases of permanent bans enforced by companies detecting usage violations. It is common for an online system to immediately blacklist a CD key caught running cracks or, in some cases, cheats. This results in a permanent ban. Players who wish to continue use of the software must repurchase it. This has inevitably led to criticism over the motivations of enforcing permanent bans.\n\nParticularly controversial is the situation which arises when multiple products' keys are bound together. If products have dependencies on other products (as is the case with expansion packs), it is common for companies to ban all bound products. For example, if a fake CD key is used with an expansion pack, the server may ban legitimate CD keys from the original game. Similarly, with Valve's Steam service, all products the user has purchased are bound into the one account. If this account is banned, every product will be banned from online play.\n\nThis \"multi-ban\" is highly controversial, since it bans users from products which they have legitimately purchased and used.\n\nBans are enforced by servers immediately upon detection of cracks or cheats, usually without human intervention. Sometimes, legitimate users are wrongly deemed in violation of the license, and banned. In large cases of false positives, they are sometimes corrected (as happened in \"World of Warcraft\".) However, individual cases may not be given any attention.\n\nA common cause of false positives (as with the \"World of Warcraft\" case above) is users of unsupported platforms. For example, users of Linux can run Windows applications through compatibility layers such as Wine and Cedega. This software combination sometimes triggers the game's server anti-cheating software, resulting in a ban due to Wine or Cedega being a Windows API compatibility layer for Linux, so it is considered third party (cheating) software by the game's server. \n\nA key recovery program is a program that is designed to read and decrypt and/or de-obfuscate the key to its original state. When the key is returned to its original state, it may be used to reinstall its corresponding software.\n\n"}

However, many countries use their gendarmerie for provost duties.\n\nAs with all official terms, some countries have specific official terminology which differs from the exact linguistic meaning. The head of the military police is commonly referred to as the Provost Marshal. This ancient title was originally given to an officer whose duty it was to ensure that the army of the king did no harm to the citizenry.\n\nMilitary police are concerned with law enforcement (including criminal investigation) on military property and concerning military personnel, installation security, close personal protection of senior military officers, management of prisoners of war, management of military prisons, traffic control, route signing and resupply route management. Not all military police organizations are concerned with all of these areas, however. These personnel are generally not front-line combatants but, especially when directing military convoys, will be at or close to the front line. Some MPs, such as the US MP Corps, are used as the primary defense force in rear area operations.\n\nIn many countries, military forces have separate prisons and judicial systems, different from civilian entities. The military possibly also has its own interpretation of criminal justice.\n\nIn the Australian Army, the Royal Australian Corps of Military Police also performs the role of a secondary communications network in the front battle zone.\n\nThe military police of the Austrian \"Bundesheer\" is called \"Kommando Militärstreife & Militärpolizei\" (Austrian Military Police).\n\nThe Belgian Army's Military Police Group (\"Groupe Police Militaire\" in French, \"Groep Militaire Politie\" in Dutch) performs military police duties on behalf of all four components of the Belgian military. The group is headed by a lieutenant-colonel and numbers 188 members in five MP companies.\n\nMilitary police duties in Belgium have always included enforcement of military discipline, managing road traffic and wartime handling of prisoners of war. In 2003, duties relating to refugees and deserters in wartime were transferred from the then disbanded \"Gendarmerie Nationale\" to the MPs. Members of the former 4 and 6 MP Companies were folded into the new MP Group, along with some Gendarmes previously assigned MP-related duties.\n\nBelgian MPs are identified by black armbands with the letters MP in white block letters, worn on the left arm.\n\nDespite the name, Brazil's \"Military Police\", or \"Polícia Militar\" (PM) units in each Brazilian state are not provost forces, but gendarmerie-like law enforcement units responsible for preventive police and public security.\n\nEach branch of the Brazilian Armed Forces, however, has its own provost force: \"Polícia do Exército\" (PE) in the Army, \"Polícia da Marinha\" (SP) in the Navy, and \"Polícia da Aeronáutica\" (PA) in the Air Force.\n\nThe Canadian Forces Military Police (CFMP) contribute to the effectiveness and readiness of the Canadian Forces (CF) and the Department of National Defence (DND) through the provision of professional police, security and operational support services worldwide.\n\nCFMP are classified as Peace Officers in the Canadian Criminal Code, which gives them the same powers as civilian law enforcement personnel to enforce Acts of Parliament on or in relation to DND property or assets anywhere in the world. They have the power to arrest anyone who is subject to the Code of Service Discipline (CSD), regardless of position or rank under the National Defence Act (NDA). MP have the power to arrest and charge non-CSD bound civilians only in cases where a crime is committed on or in relation to DND property or assets, or at the request of the Minister of Public Safety, Commissioner of the Correctional Service of Canada or Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Although MP jurisdiction is only on DND property across Canada and throughout the world, any civilian accessing these areas falls under MP jurisdiction and are dealt with in the same manner as any civilian policing agency. If in fact a crime is committed on or in relation to DND property or assets, MP have the power to arrest and charge the offender, military or civilian, under the Criminal Code. It is important to note though that the purpose of the CFMP is not to replace the job of a civilian police officer, but rather to support the Canadian Forces through security and policing services. MP also have the power to enforce the Provincial Highway Traffic Act on all military bases in Canada contrary to the Government Property Traffic Regulations (GPTR).\n\nUnlike military police in many other countries, the Republic of China Military Police (中華民國憲兵) are a separate branch of the ROC Armed Forces. The ROCMP are responsible for enforcing military law, maintaining military discipline, providing backup for the civilian police force or serving as combat troops during times of emergency, providing security for certain government buildings, including the Presidential Office Building in Taipei City, as well as performing counter-terrorism and VIP protection operations. The ROCMP are also charged with the defense of Taipei, the capital of the Republic of China (Taiwan).\n\nThe \"Sotilaspoliisi\" (\"Soldier Police\") are the military police of the Finnish Defence Forces. Their emblem is a black armband on the left shoulder with the letters 'SP' in white. SPs have no power over civilians except inside military zones and installations. However, SP's can be used as temporary manpower when the regular police are undermanned. For example, during the 2005 Helsinki athletics championships military police conscripts were placed all along the running tracks through the city to prevent the large numbers of spectators from obstructing the runners. In these cases they are given a limited amount of power over civilians, as the regular police needed the extra support to handle the large influx of tourists. As military police conscripts are trained with basic police techniques they are suitable for usage in instances such as these in Finland. Serving one's tour of duty as an SP serves as a qualification in accessing the civilian Police Academy in Finland.\n\nThe \"Gendarmerie Nationale\" acts as both the provost military police and one of the two national police forces of France. The \"Gendarmerie Navale\" (also called the \"Gendarmerie Maritime\") polices the Navy (and also acts as a coast guard and water police force) and the \"Gendarmerie de l'Air\" polices the Air Force; both are branches of the \"Gendarmerie Nationale\".\nLa prévôté, or Gendarmerie prévôtale, is a Gendarmerie Nationale unit based out of France during war operations or when large units of the French armed forces are stationed overseas.\n\nThe \"Feldjäger\" are the current military police of the German \"Bundeswehr\". The term \"Feldjäger\" (\"field rifleman\" or \"field hunter\") has a long tradition and dates back to the mid-17th century. As the current German constitution explicitly forbids the employment of troops on German territory (except for technical assistance as part of disaster relief), Feldjäger jurisdiction applies only to military facilities and military personnel. Their motto is \"Suum Cuique\" (\"To each his own\", derived from Cicero, \"De Finibus, Bonorum et Malorum\", \"liber V\", 67: \"\"(...) ut fortitudo in laboribus periculisque cernatur, (...), iustitia in\" suo cuique \"tribuendo.\"\"), the motto of the Prussian Order of the Black Eagle.\n\nDuring World War II, Nazi Germany had numerous military police units. The primary units were the \"Feldgendarmerie\", which comprised members of the \"Gendarmerie\". Other units included the Army Patrol Service (\"Heeresstreifendienst\"), the Train Station Guards (\"Bahnhofwache\"), and the \"Feldjägerkorps\".\n\nEach branch of the Hellenic Armed Forces used to maintain its own police service. i.e. \"Stratonomia\" as the military police of the Hellenic Army, \"Naftonomia\" of the Hellenic Navy and \"Aeronomia\" of the Hellenic Air Force. As of 2014, all three military police entities merged to create a single 'Armed Forces Police' (\"Astynomia Enoplon Dynameon\").\n\nThe Corps of Military Police (CMP) is the military police of the Indian Army. In addition, the CMP is trained to handle prisoners of war and to regulate traffic, as well as to handle basic telecommunication equipment such as telephone exchanges. They can be identified by their red berets, white lanyards and belts, and they also wear a black brassard with the letters \"MP\" imprinted in red.\n\nInternal policing duties in a regiment are handled by the Regimental Police, who are soldiers of the unit who are assigned to policing tasks for a short period of time. They are essentially used to regulate regimental discipline, and can be identified by a black brassard with the letters \"RP\" embossed in gold or white.\n\nThe Indian Air Force is policed by the Indian Air Force Police. They can be identified by their white peaked caps, white lanyards and belts (with a pistol holster). They also wear a black brassard with the letters \"IAFP\" imprinted in red.\n\nThe Indian Navy has the Navy Police, and they can be identified by a black brassard with the letters \"NP\" in gold, with the state emblem placed in between the N and the P.\n\nIn Indonesia, the military police are known as \"Korps Polisi Militer\" (CPM) or simply \"Polisi Militer\" (PM). They are the police of the military/armed forces organization in charge of enforcing discipline and the maintenance of law and order in the military environment and for military purposes in support of the main tasks to uphold the sovereignty of the state and territorial integrity of the Republic of Indonesia. They serve as policing units in the armed forces. The military police of Indonesia also perform duties in the area of law enforcement (including investigation of crime) involving members of the military (even in certain cases that may also involve the regular civilian police, especially if the case involves a civilian), installation of security, escort protection of senior military officers and/or important government officials, setting and supervising prisoners of war, controlling custody of military prisoners, managing military traffic control and marking and managing routes and resupply routes for military and civilian purposes. Indonesian Military Police are identifiable with their blue berets and also wear white helmet printed PM and dark blue brassard worn on their upper left sleeve also printed PM. \n\nThere are 3 military police corps in Indonesia, which are POMAD (\"Polisi Militer Angkatan Darat\") for army, POMAL (\"Polisi Militer Angkatan Laut\") for navy, and POMAU (\"Polisi Militer Angkatan Udara\") for the air force.\n\nThe Indonesian National Police also has provosts which is the internal affairs (law enforcement) division known as \"PROPAM\". This unit supervises and maintains discipline in the internal scope of the national police. Personnel of this unit are identifiable with their blue berets and wear dark blue Brassard printed PROV.\n\nThe \"Heyl HaMishtara HaTzva'it\" (\"Military Police Corps\") is the military police of the Israel Defense Forces. It also helps monitor prisons, both those containing Israeli soldiers and Palestinian detainees.\n\nThe \"Carabinieri\" is a gendarmerie force which acts as both the military police and one of the three national police forces in Italy. The \"Guardia di Finanza\" also has some limited military police duties.\n\nDuring World War II, the \"Kempeitai\" were the military police of the Imperial Japanese Army and the \"Tokkeitai\" were the military police of the Imperial Japanese Navy. They also performed intelligence and secret police functions and were active in Japan and its occupied territories.\n\nThe Japan Self-Defense Forces maintain military police units.\n\nThe \"Kor Polis Tentera DiRaja\" (Royal Military Police Corps) performs military police duties in the Malaysian Army. Apart from enforcing discipline and conduct of members of the Army, the Corps oversees security of designated Army installations, performs escort and ceremonial duties, and assists civil law enforcement authorities. The \"Kor Polis Tentera\" is also tasked with crime prevention and investigating criminal activities on Army property or by military personnel.\n\nWith its roots in the British Royal Military Police, members of the \"Kor Polis Tentera DiRaja\" also wear the distinctive red peaked cap, white lanyard and belt, as well as a black brassard with the letters \"MP\" imprinted.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the function of military police is performed by the \"Koninklijke Marechaussee\" (\"Royal Constabulary\"), a separate branch of the military independent of the Army, Navy and Air Force. Besides performing military duties, the \"Marechaussee\" is also a gendarmerie force.\n\nThe word \"Marechaussee\" seems to derive from the old French name \"Marecheaux\" given to an ancient court of justice in Paris called the \"Tribunal of Constables and Marshals of France\". These constables and marshals were to become members of the Gendarmerie which served as a model for the police forces of both Belgium and the Netherlands. The term \"Marechaussee\" was also used for the US Army's military police during the American Revolution.\n\nCurrently all Military Police duties operate under the newly established tri service unit of the New Zealand Defence Force Military Police.\n\nThe three services, Royal New Zealand Navy, New Zealand Army and Royal New Zealand Air Force still maintain their own identity but operate under a single Provost Marshall and investigate offences against the Armed Forces Discipline Act 1971.\n\nThe NZDF Military Police operates outside of the normal Navy, Army and Air Force command chain. The Provost Marshal currently holds the rank of a Group Captain and he reports directly to the Vice Chief of the NZDF.\n\nAll complex and serious investigations are handled by the New Zealand Defence Force Military Police Special Investigations Branch (SIB). It has a similar role to the Australian Defence Force Investigative Service (ADFIS).\n\nAll New Zealand Defence Force Military Police are identifieable by the blue and white \"MP\" patch they wear on their uniform and the blue beret as head dress.\n\nIn Norway, military police are service members of the Norwegian Army, Royal Norwegian Navy or Royal Norwegian Air Force. Since about 2002, all are trained at Sessvollmoen Camp.\n\nNorwegian MPs do not have authority over civilians, except on military installations or under martial law; they also have authority to direct civilian traffic as part of military exercises. They do have authority over military personnel anywhere, including when such personnel are off duty. When the Military Police uncover serious crimes among Norwegian service members, it forwards the case to the civilian Norwegian Police Service for investigation.\n\nNorwegian MPs first go through a six-month selection/educational period, before being assigned to the battalion or to regimental duties with other units for the remainder of their twelve-month service.\n\nThe \"Heimevernet\" (\"Home Guard\") also has MPs in its ranks. Usually each District (regiment) has one or two platoons, consisting exclusively of former regular or conscript military police personnel.\n\nNorwegian MPs wear a red beret and a red lanyard around the left shoulder extending to the left front pocket. Only personnel currently serving as MPs are allowed to wear this. When on official duty, they also wear the MP armband, which is black with \"MP\" in red letters. It was previously worn on the right shoulder, but is now worn on the left shoulder, following NATO practice. They can also wear white webbing, or a number of items for special duties, like high visibility vests for traffic duty etc.\n\nArmy canine units are also assigned to the MP battalion, but the personnel in such units are not necessarily MPs. Such personnel do not hold military police authority, and do not wear the MP insignia.\n\nThe military police of the Siły Zbrojne Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej is called Żandarmeria Wojskowa.\n\nIn Portugal, each branch of the armed forces has its own military police force. The Portuguese Navy has the \"Polícia Naval\" (Naval Police), the Portuguese Army has the \"Polícia do Exército\" (Army Police), and the Portuguese Air Force has the \"Polícia Aérea\" (Air Police). The Air Police is an Arm of its own inside the Air Force, but the Army Police is only a speciality of the Cavalry Arm and the Naval Police is a speciality of the Marines. There is also the Republican National Guard (Portugal), a gendarmerie type police force, responsible for law enforcement in the countryside and small towns.\n\nUntil 2010 The Russian OMON and the Military prosecution were operated as military police. On 2012 Ministry of Defense has established the VP which headed by a 1st deputy Minister.\n\nEach of the Sri Lankan Armed Forces has its own military police/Provost branch. The Sri Lanka Army is policed by the Sri Lanka Corps of Military Police and by Regimental Police, who belong to each individual regiments or corps.\n\nThe Military Police force carries out the following missions:\n\n\nThe Sri Lanka Navy is policed by the Provost Branch. The Sri Lanka Air Force is policed by the Air Force Police (AFP).\n\nIn Singapore, the Singapore Armed Forces Military Police Command serves as the military police unit of the Singapore Armed Forces, and supports the Singapore Police Force by way of collaborations, such as in the co-location of dog-training facilities for policing duties.\n\nThe Singapore Civil Defence Force has a Provost unit which handles the force's security and regimental disciplinary matters. The unit is made up of Full-time National Servicemen and regular officers, some being seconded from the Singapore Police Force. A 3-week provost course is conducted after completing Basic Rescue Training at the SCDF Detention Barracks. Trainees are taught basic control and restrain techniques, baton use, handcuffs and various other security components. The provost uniform is similar to the SAF Military Police with the exception of the lanyard which is worn on the left instead and the uniform colour which is dark blue.\n\nIn Thailand, each branch of the armed forces has its own military police force (สารวัตรทหาร). The Royal Thai Navy has the Naval Military Police (สารวัตรทหารเรือ), the Royal Thai Army has the Army Military Police (สารวัตรทหารบก), and the Royal Thai Air force has the Air Force Military Police (สารวัตรทหารอากาศ).\n\nIn Turkey, the Military Police (\"Askeri İnzibat\") is a very small force that handles military security and military crimes.\n\nThe larger Turkish Gendarmerie (\"Jandarma Genel Komutanlığı\"), one of the five branches of the Turkish Armed Forces, is responsible for maintaining law and order in rural areas which do not fall under the jurisdiction of regular police forces.\n\nEach of the British Armed Forces has its own military police branch.\n\nThe British Army is policed by the Royal Military Police (RMP).\n\nThe Royal Air Force is policed by the Royal Air Force Police (RAFP).\n\nThe Royal Navy is policed by the Royal Navy Police (formerly the Royal Navy Regulating Branch). The Royal Marines maintains a platoon-sized Police Troop, formerly the Royal Marines Police, which has been part of the Royal Navy Police since 2009.\n\nEach of the three Services has its own Special Investigation Branch (SIB) to undertake investigations of a serious or complex nature. SIB investigators normally wear plain-clothes and operate in a similar to manner to civilian police CID.\n\nAll British military police are correctly named as 'Service Police' and conform to the Service Police Codes of Practice (SPCoP). Powers for all arms of the British Service Police come from Armed Forces Act 2006, which came into force in 2008.\n\nThe Military Corrective Training Centre – for all three services – at Colchester is operated by the Military Provost Staff Corps (MPS), an all-senior NCO corps which only recruits from serving personnel (but will liaise with other military and government sources as is appropriate). MPS are not police and serve the same function as a prison officer. This role is additionally carried out by them on operations when handling foreign detainees at Main Operating Bases such as Camp Bastion/Kandahar.\n\nThe Military Police Corps maintains discipline and enforces the law in the United States Army. The Marine Corps version is referred to as the Provost Marshal's Office, while personnel assigned to the Master-at-Arms branch fill the same role in the United States Navy, (aided by temporary members of the Shore Patrol). The United States Air Force is policed by the Air Force Security Forces, formerly called the Air Police and then Security Police.\n\nCriminal investigation in the United States Armed Forces is carried out by separate agencies: The Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) (a civilian agency), the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (OSI), the Pentagon Force Protection Agency (PFPA), the Army Criminal Investigation Division (CID), the Coast Guard Investigative Service (CGIS), and the Marine Corps United States Marine Corps Criminal Investigation Division (USMCCID). The Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) is a civilian agency that answers directly to the DOD.\n\nThe United States Constabulary was a gendarmerie force used to secure and patrol the American Zone of West Germany immediately after World War II.\n\nIn Vietnam, the 144th Brigade of Provost is under command of the General Staff of the Vietnam People's Army. Vietnam Provost is responsible for policing the armed forces\n"}
{"id": "153324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=153324", "title": "Public policy", "text": "Public policy\n\nPublic policy is the principled guide to action taken by the administrative executive branches of the state with regard to a class of issues, in a manner consistent with law and institutional customs. \n\nThe foundation of public policy is composed of national constitutional laws and regulations. Further substrates include both judicial interpretations and regulations which are generally authorized by legislation. Public policy is considered strong when it solves problems efficiently and effectively, serves and supports governmental institutions and policies, and encourages active citizenship.\n\nOther scholars define public policy as a system of \"courses of action, regulatory measures, laws, and funding priorities concerning a given topic promulgated by a governmental entity or its representatives.\" Public policy is commonly embodied in \"constitutions, legislative acts, and judicial decisions.\"\n\nIn the United States, this concept refers not only to the result of policies, but more broadly to the decision-making and analysis of governmental decisions. As an academic discipline, public policy is studied by professors and students at public policy schools of major universities throughout the country. The U.S. professional association of public policy practitioners, researchers, scholars, and students is the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management.\n\nPublic policy making can be characterized as a dynamic, complex, and interactive system through which public problems are identified and countered by creating new public policy or by reforming existing public policy.\n\nPublic problems can originate in endless ways and require different policy responses (such as regulations, subsidies, Import quota|quotas, and laws) on the local, national, or international level.\n\nPublic policy making is a continuous process that has many feedback loops. Verification and program evaluation are essential to the functioning of this system. \n\nThe public problems that influence public policy making can be of economic, social, or political nature. \n\nEach system is influenced by different public problems and issues, and has different stakeholders; as such, each requires different public policy.\n\nIn public policy making, numerous individuals, corporations, non-profit organizations and interest groups compete and collaborate to influence policymakers to act in a particular way.\n\nThe large set of actors in the public policy process, such as politicians, civil servants, lobbyists, domain experts, and industry or sector representatives, use a variety of tactics and tools to advance their aims, including advocating their positions publicly, attempting to educate supporters and opponents, and mobilizing allies on a particular issue. \n\nMany actors can be important in the public policy process, but government officials ultimately choose public policy in response to the public issue or problem at hand. In doing so, government officials are expected to meet public sector ethics and take the needs of all project stakeholder|stakeholders into account.\n\nSince societies have changed in the past decades, the public policy making system changed too. In the 2010s, public policy making is increasingly goal-oriented, aiming for measurable results and goals, and decision-centric, focusing on decisions that must be taken immediately. \n\nFurthermore, mass communications and technological changes such as the widespread availability of the Internet have caused the public policy system to become more complex and interconnected. The changes pose new challenges to the current public policy systems and pressures leaders to evolve to remain effective and efficient.\n\nAs an academic discipline, public policy brings in elements of many social science fields and concepts, including economics, sociology, political economy, social policy, program evaluation, policy analysis, and public management, all as applied to problems of governmental administration, management, and operations. At the same time, the study of public policy is distinct from political science or economics, in its focus on the application of theory to practice. While the majority of public policy degrees are master's and doctoral degrees, there are several universities that offer undergraduate education in public policy.\n\nTraditionally, the academic field of public policy focused on domestic policy. However, the wave of economic globalization that occurred in the late 20th and early 21st centuries created a need for a subset of public policy that focused on global governance, especially as it relates to issues that transcend national borders such as climate change, terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and economic development. Consequently, many traditional public policy schools had to adjust their curricula to better suit this new policy landscape, as well as develop entirely new curricula altogether.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9258879", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9258879", "title": "Qualified personal residence trust", "text": "Qualified personal residence trust\n\nResidence trusts in the United States are used to transfer a grantor's residence out of the grantor's estate at a low gift tax value. Once the trust is funded with the grantor's residence, the residence and any future appreciation of the residence are excluded from the grantor's estate, if the grantor survives the term of the trust, as explained below.\n\nPersonal residence trusts (\"PRTs\") are irrevocable split interest trusts. The transfer of the residence to the trust constitutes a completed gift. The split interest character of the trust is as follows: the grantor retains the right to live in the house for a number of years, rent free, and then the remainder beneficiaries of the trust become fully vested in their interest. PRTs are similar by nature to other types of retained interest trusts, like GRITs, GRATs and GRUTs.\n\nGenerally, if the grantor retains an interest in the trust, then for estate and gift tax valuation purposes, his retained interest is valued at zero. However, if the retained interest is \"qualified\" within the meaning of United States \"Internal Revenue Code\" (\"Code\") section 2702(b), its value is determined under Code Section 7520.\n\nThe value of the retained interest, as will be explained in more detail below, is important for gift tax purposes. Because the transfer of the residence to the PRT is a completed gift, it is desirable to minimize the value of the gift. The gift is valued at the fair market value of the residence, less the value of the retained interest. Consequently, if the retained interest is valued at zero, the taxable gift equals the fair market value of the residence. If the retained interest is valued under Code section 7520, its value will be greater than zero, and the gift value is minimized.\n\nCode section 7520 values the remainder interest using the term of the trust, the life expectancy of the grantor and the 7520 rate in effect for the month of the transfer. The longer the term of the trust and the higher the 7520 rate, the lower the value of the gift. The age of the grantor also matters. If the grantor is older there is a greater likelihood that the grantor will die during the term of the retained interest (when a contingent reversion is retained by the grantor).\n\nThe regulations under Code section 2702 allow two types of qualified trusts: personal residence trusts and qualified personal residence trusts (\"QPRTs\"). Of the two, QPRTs are more widely used because they possess a greater degree of flexibility.\n\nA personal residence is one of the following:\n\nUp to two residences may be transferred into residence trusts, and one must be the primary residence. The other residence, usually a vacation home, may be rented by the grantor a portion of the time, but the grantor must live in the vacation home for more than the greater of 14 days or 10% of the number of days rented.\n\nPersonal residences that are mortgaged may be transferred to a residence trust. To the extent the residence is encumbered, the value of the property transferred will be reduced for gift tax purposes. As mortgage payments continue to be made by the grantor, additional gifts are made to the remaindermen.\n\nSome commentators suggest that the additional gifts can be avoided by having the grantor indemnify the trust for the mortgage debt. Under this analysis, the amount of the gift to the trust is the fair market value of the residence undiminished by the mortgage, and the grantor's mortgage payments do not constitute additional gifts.\n\nTo escape valuation under Code section 2702 (i.e., retained interest valued at zero), a PRT must comply with the following two primary requirements: (i) the trust may hold only one residence which must be used as the grantor's personal residence during the term of the trust; and (ii) the trust may not allow the sale of the residence during the term of the trust. Additionally, following the expiration of the residence term, sale to grantor or grantor's spouse is also prohibited.\n\nThe inability to sell the residence is a major restriction on the flexibility of a PRT and usually makes QPRTs more desirable. PRTs do not, however, have many other technical restrictions that QPRTs are subject to.\n\nSimilar to PRTs, QPRTs must comply with certain requirements to avoid valuation under Code Section 2702. The QPRT requirements are as follows: (i) income must be distributed to the grantor at least annually; (ii) no distributions of principal may be made to any person other than the grantor; (iii) only one personal residence may be held in the trust, but as discussed below, certain other assets may be held in the trust, as well; (iv) to the extent the trust hold cash in excess of the amount allowed, such cash must be distributed at least quarterly; (v) the QPRT status will cease if the residence is no longer used in such capacity.\n\nQPRTs are permitted the following: (i) the residence may be sold, but not to the grantor or the grantor's spouse (the residence may pass to the grantor's spouse without any consideration at the end of the term); (ii) if the residence is sold, the trust may continue holding the sale proceeds, so long as the cash is held in a separate bank account; (iii) cash may be added to the trust, and then held in a segregated bank account, for the payment of certain expenses connected with the residence; (iv) the trust may permit improvements to be added onto the residence; and (v) the grantor's interest may be converted into an annuity, if the trust contains provisions required by Treasury Regulations Section 25.2702-3 for a qualified annuity interest.\n\nIf the residence is sold and the trust retains the cash, then the trust must provide that it will terminate as a QPRT with respect to the cash, no later than the earlier of: (i) the date that is two years after the date of sale; (ii) the termination of grantor's interest in the trust; or (iii) the date on which a new residence is acquired by the trust. If the QPRT status of the trust terminates as to the cash, then the cash comes back into the grantor's estate.\n\nA residence trust (PRT or QPRT) will remain a grantor trust during the grantor's retained term. Grantor status is important, because it will allow the grantor to take mortgage interest and property tax deductions, and will also avail the grantor of the Code Section 121 gain exclusion.\n\nFollowing the expiration of the residence term, the grantor status of the trust usually ceases, unless the trust is drafted in a manner to make the trust intentionally grantor following the expiration of the term. This may be advantageous if the trust holds a vacation home and the grantor wishes to deduct mortgage interest and expenses associated with that home.\n\nIf a grantor dies during the retained term of a residence trust, the full value of the trust property is included in the grantor's estate under Code Section 2036(a)(1) (because the grantor retains the right to possess or enjoy the property). If the grantor retains a reversionary interest during the retained term of the trust, the value of the residence is included in the grantor's estate under Code Section 2033.\n\nHowever, it is usually prudent to include in a QPRT a contingent reversionary interest during the retained term of the trust. If the grantor dies during the retained term, the residence is included in the grantor's estate whether or not there is a reversionary interest. But, if there is a reversionary interest, the age of the grantor now comes into the valuation of the retained interest. Because now there is a possibility that the grantor will die within the retained term and the remainder beneficiaries will then receive nothing, the value of the retained term increases and the value of the remainder interest decreases (only the transfer of the remainder interest is subject to the gift tax, so it is beneficial to decrease its value).\n\nFollowing the expiration of the retained term, the residence is no longer included in the grantor's estate; provided that the grantor is not a beneficiary of the trust and does not have the right to rent the residence for less than fair market value.\n"}
{"id": "153067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=153067", "title": "Royal assent", "text": "Royal assent\n\nA royal assent is the method by which a country's monarch (possibly through a delegated official) formally approves an act of that nation's parliament. In certain nations, such assent makes the act law (promulgation) while in other nations assent is distinct from promulgation. In the vast majority of contemporary monarchies, this act is considered to be little more than a formality; even in those nations which still permit their monarchs to withhold royal assent (such as the United Kingdom, Norway, and Liechtenstein), the monarch almost never does so, save in a dire political emergency or upon the advice of their government. While the power to withhold royal assent was once exercised often in European monarchies, it is exceedingly rare in the modern, democratic political atmosphere that has developed there since the 18th century.\n\nRoyal assent is sometimes associated with elaborate ceremonies. In the United Kingdom, for instance, the sovereign may appear personally in the House of Lords or may appoint Lords Commissioners, who announce that royal assent has been granted at a ceremony held at the Palace of Westminster for this purpose. However, royal assent is usually granted less ceremonially by letters patent. In other nations, such as Australia, the governor-general merely signs the bill. In Canada, the governor general may give assent either in person at a ceremony held in the Senate or by a written declaration notifying parliament of his or her agreement to the bill.\n\nBefore the Royal Assent by Commission Act of 1541 became law, assent was always required to be given by the sovereign in person before Parliament.\n\nThe last time royal assent was given by the sovereign in person in Parliament was in the reign of Queen Victoria at a prorogation on 12 August 1854.\n\nThe Act was repealed and replaced by the Royal Assent Act 1967. However section 1(2) of that Act does not prevent the sovereign from declaring assent in person if he or she so desires.\n\nRoyal assent is the final step required for a parliamentary bill to become law. Once a bill is presented to the sovereign or the sovereign's representative, he or she has the following formal options:\n\nUnder modern constitutional conventions, the sovereign acts on the advice of his or her ministers. Since these ministers most often enjoy the support of parliament and obtain the passage of bills, it is improbable that they would advise the sovereign to withhold assent. Hence, in modern practice, royal assent is never withheld.\n\nThe sovereign is generally believed not to legally have the power to withhold assent from a bill against the advice of ministers. The last bill that was refused assent by the sovereign (on the advice of ministers) was the Scottish Militia Bill during Queen Anne's reign in 1708.\n\nOriginally, legislative power was exercised by the sovereign acting on the advice of the \"Curia Regis\", or Royal Council, in which important magnates and clerics participated and which evolved into parliament. In 1265, the Earl of Leicester irregularly called a full parliament without royal authorisation. Membership of the so-called Model Parliament, established in 1295 under Edward I included bishops, abbots, earls, barons, two knights from each shire and two burgesses from each borough. The body eventually came to be divided into two branches: bishops, abbots, earls, and barons formed the House of Lords, while the shire and borough representatives formed the House of Commons. The King would seek the advice and consent of both houses before making any law. During Henry VI's reign, it became regular practice for the two houses to originate legislation in the form of bills, which would not become law unless the sovereign's assent was obtained, as the sovereign was, and still remains, the enactor of laws. Hence, all Acts include the clause \"Be it enacted by the Queen's (King's) most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows...\". The Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 provide a second potential preamble if the House of Lords were to be excluded from the process.\n\nThe power of parliament to pass bills was often thwarted by monarchs. Charles I dissolved parliament in 1629, after it passed motions and bills critical of—and seeking to restrict—his arbitrary exercise of power. During the eleven years of personal rule that followed, Charles performed legally dubious actions such as raising taxes without Parliament's approval. After the English Civil War, it was accepted that parliament should be summoned to meet regularly, but it was still commonplace for monarchs to refuse royal assent to bills. In 1678, Charles II withheld his assent from a bill \"for preserving the Peace of the Kingdom by raising the Militia, and continuing them in Duty for Two and Forty Days,\" suggesting that he, not parliament, should control the militia. The last Stuart monarch, Anne, similarly withheld on 11 March 1708, on the advice of her ministers, her assent to the Scottish Militia Bill. No monarch has since withheld royal assent on a bill passed by the British parliament.\n\nDuring the rule of the succeeding Hanoverian dynasty, power was gradually exercised more by parliament and the government. The first Hanoverian monarch, George I, relied on his ministers to a greater extent than had previous monarchs. Later Hanoverian monarchs attempted to restore royal control over legislation: George III and George IV both openly opposed Catholic Emancipation and asserted that to grant assent to a Catholic emancipation bill would violate the Coronation Oath, which required the sovereign to preserve and protect the established Church of England from Papal domination, and would grant rights to individuals who were in league with a foreign power which did not recognise their legitimacy. However, George IV reluctantly granted his assent upon the advice of his ministers. Thus, as the concept of ministerial responsibility has evolved, the power to withhold royal assent has fallen into disuse, both in the United Kingdom and in the other Commonwealth realms.\n\nIn 1914, George V did take legal advice on withholding royal assent from the Government of Ireland Bill, a highly contentious piece of legislation that the Liberal government intended to push through parliament by means of the Parliament Act 1911. The King decided that he should not withhold assent without \"convincing evidence that it would avert a national disaster, or at least have a tranquillising effect on the distracting conditions of the time\".\n\nRoyal assent is the final stage in the legislative process for acts of the Scottish parliament. The process is governed by sections 28, 32, and 33 of the Scotland Act 1998. After a bill has been passed, the Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament submits it to the monarch for royal assent after a four-week period, during which the Advocate General for Scotland, the Lord Advocate, the Attorney General or the Secretary of State for Scotland may refer the bill to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom (prior to 1 October 2009, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council) for review of its legality. Royal assent is signified by letters patent under the Great Seal of Scotland in the following form which is set out in The Scottish Parliament (Letters Patent and Proclamations) Order 1999 (SI 1999/737) and of which notice is published in the London, Edinburgh, and Belfast Gazettes:\n\nMeasures, which were the means by which the National Assembly for Wales passed legislation between 2006 and 2011, were assented to by the Queen by means of an Order in Council. Section 102 of the Government of Wales Act 2006 required the Clerk to the Assembly to present measures passed by the assembly after a four-week period during which the Counsel General for Wales or the Attorney General could refer the proposed measure to the Supreme Court for a decision as to whether the measure was within the assembly's legislative competence.\n\nFollowing the referendum held in March 2011, in which the majority vote for the assembly's law-making powers to be extended, measures were replaced by Acts of the Assembly. Similarly to Acts of the Scottish parliament, after a four-week waiting period royal assent to acts of the assembly will be given by means of letters patent using the following wording:\n\nThe letters patent may also be made in Welsh.\n\nUnder section 14 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, a bill which has been approved by the Northern Ireland Assembly is presented to the Queen by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland for royal assent after a four-week waiting period during which the Attorney General for Northern Ireland may refer the bill to the Supreme Court. Assent is given by means of letters patent in the following form set out in the Northern Ireland (Royal Assent to Bills) Order 1999.\n\nBetween 1922 and 1972, bills passed by the Parliament of Northern Ireland were passed to the Governor of Northern Ireland for royal assent under the Government of Ireland Act of 1920, replacing the office of Lord Lieutenant.\n\nUnder the Church of England Assembly (Powers) Act 1919 a measure of the General Synod of the Church of England becomes law once it has received royal assent in the same way as an Act of Parliament.\n\nThe lieutenant governors of the Bailiwick of Jersey and the Bailiwick and Islands of Guernsey do not by and under their own authority grant assent, nor, as proxies, as the British crown's representative, deliver royal assent, to legislation emanating from the respective legislatures of these islands.\n\nThe States of Jersey Law 2005 abolishes the power of the lieutenant governor to directly impose a formal veto to a resolution of the States of Jersey.\n\nThe monarch of the United Kingdom, sitting in (together with members of the Cabinet of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of the day, and who are also members of) the Privy Council, grants the equivalent of the royal assent to Jersey and Guernsey legislation (under the formula, or other words to the effect: \"Her Majesty, having taken the report into consideration, was pleased, by and with the advice of Her Privy Council, to approve and ratify this Act (a copy of which is annexed to this Order) and to order that it, together with this Order, shall be entered on the Register of the Island of Jersey (or of the Islands of Guernsey) and observed accordingly. Her Majesty's Officers in the Island (or Islands), and all other whom it may concern, are therefore to take notice of Her Majesty's Order and to proceed accordingly\").\n\nThe equivalent of the royal assent is formally granted or formally refused on the formal advice of the Committee of Council for the Affairs of Jersey and Guernsey in pursuance of Queen Elizabeth II's order-in-council of 22 February 1952. A recent example when the equivalent of the royal assent was refused was in 2007, concerning reforms to the constitution of the Chief Pleas of Sark. (A revised version of the proposed reforms was subsequently given the equivalent of the royal assent.)\n\nIn 2011, campaigners against a law that sought to reduce the number of senators in the states of Jersey petitioned the Privy Council to advise the Queen to refuse the equivalent of the royal assent. An Order in Council of 13 July 2011 established new rules for the consideration of petitions against the granting of the equivalent of the royal assent.\n\nLegislation in Jersey and Guernsey entitled \"Laws\" would seem to require the formal equivalent of the royal assent from the British monarch sitting in the Privy Council; other legislation such as regulations and orders (in Jersey) and ordinances (in Guernsey) would not seem to require such formal equivalent of the royal assent.\n\nThere is a proposal that the Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey should be granted the delegated power of granting the equivalent of the royal assent, formally from the monarch and the Privy Council, to enable laws to be granted formal approval within six weeks if no objection was raised, rather than having to formally refer every law for formal consideration in London and then formal approval also (usually) in London. \"At present there is a situation where Channel Island law-making depends, ultimately, on the UK government of the day, unelected by the islands.\"\n\nSpecial procedures apply to legislation passed by the Tynwald of the Isle of Man. Before the lordship of the Island was purchased by the British Crown in 1765 (the Revestment), the assent of the Lord of Mann to a bill was signified by letter to the governor. After 1765, the equivalent of the royal assent was at first signified by the letter from the Secretary of State to the governor; but, during the British Regency, the practice began of granting the equivalent of the royal assent to Manx legislation by Orders in Council, which continues to this day, though limited to exceptional cases since 1981.\n\nIn 1981, an Order in Council delegated to the lieutenant governor the power to grant royal assent to bills passed by Tynwald. The lieutenant governor must however refer any bill impacting on reserved powers (defence, foreign relations, nationality law, the relationship between the island and the United Kingdom and any matters relating to the monarch) to the British government for advice, on which he is required to act.\n\nThe above procedures are not sufficient to cause an Act of Tynwald to come into full force of law. By ancient custom, an Act did not come into force until it had been \"promulgated\" at an open-air sitting of the Tynwald, historically held on Tynwald Hill at St John's on St John's Day (24 June), but, since the adoption of the Gregorian calendar in 1753, on 5 July (or on the following Monday if 5 July is a Saturday or Sunday). \"Promulgation\" originally consisted of the reading of the Act in English and Manx; but after 1865 the reading of the title of the Act and a summary of each section was sufficient. This was reduced in 1895 to the titles and a memorandum of the object and purport of the Act, and since 1988 only the short title and a summary of the long title have been read.\n\nAn emergency procedure enabling an Act to come into force at the same moment as the receipt of the equivalent of the royal assent, when it is being announced at an ordinary sitting of the Tynwald, subject to its being promulgated within 12 months, was introduced in 1916; since 1988, this has been the normal procedure, but an Act ceases to have effect unless promulgated within 18 months after the equivalent of the royal assent is announced in the Tynwald.\n\nSince 1993, the Sodor and Man Diocesan Synod of the Church of England within the Province of York has had power to enact measures making provision \"with respect to any matter concerning the Church of England in the Island\". If approved by the Tynwald, a measure \"shall have the force and effect of an Act of Tynwald upon the Royal Assent thereto being announced to the Tynwald\". Between 1979 and 1993, the Synod had similar powers, but limited to the extension to the Isle of Man of measures of the General Synod. Before 1994, the equivalent of the royal assent was granted by Order in Council, as for a bill, but the power to grant the equivalent of the royal assent to measures has now been delegated to the lieutenant governor. A Measure does not require \"promulgation\".\n\nThe governors (or the acting governors) of British overseas territories grant, withhold, or formally refuse the grant of their own \"Governor's assent\", under their own official personal authority as governors, for \"colonial\" or local legislation. Although the governor's assent is also normally granted, this is altogether different in nature to the royal assent.\n\nIn Commonwealth realms other than the UK, royal assent is granted or withheld either by the realm's sovereign or, more frequently, by the representative of the sovereign, the governor-general. In federated realms, assent in each state or province is granted or withheld by the representatives of the sovereign. In Australia, this is the governors of the states. For Canada, this is the lieutenant governors of the provinces. A lieutenant governor may defer assent to the governor general, and the governor general may defer assent to federal bills to the sovereign.\n\nIf the Governor General of Canada is unable to give assent, it can be done by either the Deputy of the Governor General of Canada—the Chief Justice of Canada—or another justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. It is not actually necessary for the governor general to sign a bill passed by a legislature, the signature being merely an attestation. In each case, the parliament must be apprised of the granting of assent before the bill is considered to have become law. Two methods are available: the sovereign's representatives may grant assent in the presence of both houses of parliament; alternatively, each house may be notified separately, usually by the speaker of that house. However, though both houses must be notified on the same day, notice to the House of Commons while it is not in session may be given by way of publishing a special issue of the \"Journals of the House of Commons\", whereas the Senate must be sitting and the governor general's letter read aloud by the speaker.\n\nAt both state and federal realms in Australia, assent is used as the means of enforcing a referendum that is required. This is done by providing that it will not be lawful to even submit the law for viceregal assent unless and until it has been approved by the required percentage of the voting populace at a referendum.\n\nWhile royal assent has not been withheld in the United Kingdom since 1708, it has often been withheld in British colonies and former colonies by governors acting on royal instructions. In the United States Declaration of Independence, colonists complained that George III \"has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good [and] has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\" Even after colonies such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, and Newfoundland were granted responsible government, the British government continued to sometimes advise governors-general on the granting of assent; assent was also occasionally reserved to allow the British government to examine a bill before advising the governor-general.\n\nSince the Balfour Declaration of 1926 and the \"Statute of Westminster 1931\", all the Commonwealth realms have been sovereign kingdoms, the monarch and governors-general acting solely on the advice of the local ministers, who generally maintain the support of the legislature and are the ones who secure the passage of bills. They therefore are unlikely to advise the sovereign, or his or her representative, to withhold assent. The power to withhold the royal assent was exercised by Alberta's lieutenant governor, John C. Bowen, in 1937, in respect of three bills passed in the legislature dominated by William Aberhart's Social Credit party. Two bills sought to put banks under the authority of the province, thereby interfering with the federal government's powers. The third, the Accurate News and Information Bill, purported to force newspapers to print government rebuttals to stories to which the provincial cabinet objected. The unconstitutionality of all three bills was later confirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada and by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.\n\nIn Australia, a technical issue arose with the royal assent in both 1976 and 2001. In 1976, a bill originating in the House of Representatives was mistakenly submitted to the Governor-General and assented to. However, it was later discovered that it had not been passed by the Senate. The error arose because two bills of the same title had originated from the House. The Governor-General revoked the first assent, before assenting to the bill which had actually passed the Senate and the House. The same procedure was followed to correct a similar error which arose in 2001.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a bill is presented for royal assent after it has passed all the required stages in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Under the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, the House of Commons may, under certain circumstances, direct that a bill be presented for assent despite lack of passage by the House of Lords. Officially, assent is granted by the sovereign or by Lords Commissioners authorised to act by letters patent. It may be granted in parliament or outside parliament; in the latter case, each house must be separately notified before the bill takes effect.\nThe Clerk of the Parliaments, an official of the House of Lords, traditionally states a formula in Anglo-Norman Law French, indicating the sovereign's decision. The granting of royal assent to a supply bill is indicated with the words \"La Reyne remercie ses bons sujets, accepte leur benevolence, et ainsi le veult\", translated as \"The Queen thanks her good subjects, accepts their bounty, and wills it so.\" For other public or private bills, the formula is simply \"La Reyne le veult\" (\"the Queen wills it\"). For personal bills, the phrase is \"Soit fait comme il est désiré\" (\"let it be as it is desired\"). The appropriate formula for withholding assent is the euphemistic \"La Reyne s'avisera\" (\"the Queen will consider it\"). When the sovereign is male, \"Le Roy\" is substituted for \"La Reyne\".\nBefore the reign of Henry VIII, the sovereign always granted his or her assent in person. The sovereign, wearing the Imperial State Crown, would be seated on the throne in the Lords chamber, surrounded by heralds and members of the royal court—a scene that nowadays is repeated only at the annual State Opening of Parliament. The Commons, led by their speaker, would listen from the Bar of the Lords, just outside the chamber. The Clerk of the Parliaments presented the bills awaiting assent to the monarch, save that supply bills were traditionally brought up by the speaker. The Clerk of the Crown, standing on the sovereign's right, then read aloud the titles of the bills (in earlier times, the entire text of the bills). The Clerk of the Parliaments, standing on the sovereign's left, responded by stating the appropriate Norman French formula.\n\nA new device for granting assent was created during the reign of King Henry VIII. In 1542, Henry sought to execute his fifth wife, Catherine Howard, whom he accused of committing adultery; the execution was to be authorised not after a trial but by a bill of attainder, to which he would have to personally assent after listening to the entire text. Henry decided that \"the repetition of so grievous a Story and the recital of so infamous a crime\" in his presence \"might reopen a Wound already closing in the Royal Bosom\". Therefore, parliament inserted a clause into the Act of Attainder, providing that assent granted by Commissioners \"is and ever was and ever shall be, as good\" as assent granted by the sovereign personally. The procedure was used only five times during the 16th century, but more often during the 17th and 18th centuries, especially when George III's health began to deteriorate. Queen Victoria became the last monarch to personally grant assent in 1854.\nWhen granting assent by commission, the sovereign authorises three or more (normally five) lords who are Privy Counsellors to declare assent in his or her name. The Lords Commissioners, as the monarch's representatives are known, wear scarlet parliamentary robes and sit on a bench between the throne and the Woolsack. The Lords Reading Clerk reads the commission aloud; the senior commissioner then states, \"My Lords, in obedience to Her Majesty's Commands, and by virtue of the Commission which has been now read, We do declare and notify to you, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons in Parliament assembled, that Her Majesty has given Her Royal Assent to the several Acts in the Commission mentioned.\"\nDuring the 1960s, the ceremony of assenting by commission was discontinued and is now only employed once a year, at the end of the annual parliamentary session. In 1960, the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod arrived to summon the House of Commons during a heated debate and several members protested against the disruption by refusing to attend the ceremony. The debacle was repeated in 1965; this time, when the Speaker left the chair to go to the House of Lords, some members continued to make speeches. As a result, the Royal Assent Act 1967 was passed, creating an additional form for the granting of royal assent. As the attorney-general explained, \"there has been a good deal of resentment not only at the loss of Parliamentary time that has been involved but at the breaking of the thread of a possibly eloquent speech and the disruption of a debate that may be caused.\" The granting of assent by the monarch in person, or by commission, is still possible, but this third form is used on a day-to-day basis.\nUnder the Royal Assent Act 1967, royal assent can be granted by the sovereign in writing, by means of letters patent, that are presented to the presiding officer of each house of parliament. Then, the presiding officer makes a formal, but simple statement to the house, acquainting each house that royal assent has been granted to the acts mentioned. Thus, unlike the granting of royal assent by the monarch in person or by Royal Commissioners, the method created by the Royal Assent Act 1967 does not require both houses to meet jointly for the purpose of receiving the notice of royal assent. The standard text of the letters patent is set out in The Crown Office (Forms and Proclamations Rules) Order 1992, with minor amendments in 2000. In practice this remains the standard method, a fact that is belied by the wording of the letters patent for the appointment of the Royal Commissioners and by the wording of the letters patent for the granting of royal assent in writing under the 1967 Act (\"... And forasmuch as We cannot at this time be present in the Higher House of Our said Parliament being the accustomed place for giving Our Royal Assent...\").\nWhen the act is assented to by the sovereign in person, or by empowered Royal Commissioners, royal assent is considered given at the moment when the assent is declared in the presence of both houses jointly assembled. When the procedure created by the Royal Assent Act 1967 is followed, assent is considered granted when the presiding officers of both houses, having received the letters patent from the king or queen signifying the assent, have notified their respective house of the grant of royal assent. Thus, if each presiding officer makes the announcement at a different time (for instance because one house is not sitting on a certain date), assent is regarded as effective when the second announcement is made. This is important because, under British Law, unless there is any provision to the contrary, an act takes effect on the date on which it receives royal assent and that date is not regarded as being the date when the letters patent are signed, or when they are delivered to the presiding officers of each house, but the date on which both houses have been formally acquainted of the assent.\nIndependently of the method used to signify royal assent, it is the responsibility of the Clerk of the Parliaments, once the assent has been duly notified to both houses, not only to endorse the act in the name of the monarch with the formal Norman French formula, but to certify that assent has been granted. The clerk signs one authentic copy of the bill and inserts the date (in English) on which the assent was notified to the two houses after the title of the act. When an act is published, the signature of the clerk is omitted, as is the Norman French formula, should the endorsement have been made in writing. However, the date on which the assent was notified is printed in brackets.\n\nThe House of Commons speaker John Bercow said the EU withdrawal bill, passed by both houses of parliament in 2018, had been signed into law by the monarch, her Majesty the Queen Elizabeth II. “I have to notify the House in accordance with the Royal Assent Act 1967 that her Majesty has signified her royal assent to the following acts ... European Union Withdrawal Act 2018,” Commons Speaker John Bercow told lawmakers during a session of the house. \n\nIn Commonwealth realms, assent may be granted by the sovereign in person, by the governor-general in person, or by a deputy acting for the governor-general. In all of the realms, however, assent is more often granted or signified outside the legislature, with each house being notified separately. \n\nIn Australia, the formal ceremony of granting assent in parliament has not been regularly used since the early 20th century. Now, the bill is sent to the governor-general's residence by the house in which it originated. The governor-general then signs the bill, sending messages to the president of the Senate and the speaker of the House of Representatives, who notify their respective houses of the governor-general's action. A similar practice is followed in New Zealand, where the governor-general has not granted the Royal Assent in person in parliament since 1875.\n\nIn Canada, the traditional ceremony for granting assent in parliament was regularly used until the 21st century, long after it had been discontinued in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms. One result, conceived as part of a string of acts intended to demonstrate Canada's status as an independent realm, was that King George VI personally assented to nine bills of the Canadian parliament during his 1939 tour of Canada—85 years after his great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, had last granted royal assent personally in the United Kingdom. Under the Royal Assent Act 2002, however, the alternative practice of granting assent in writing, with each house being notified separately (the Speaker of the Senate or a representative reads to the senators the letters from the governor general regarding the written declaration of Royal Assent), was brought into force. As the act also provides, royal assent is to be signified—by the governor general, or, more often, by a deputy, usually a Justice of the Supreme Court, at least twice each calendar year: for the first appropriation measure and for at least one other act, usually the first non-appropriation measure passed. However, the act provides that a grant of royal assent is not rendered invalid by a failure to employ the traditional ceremony where required.\n\nThe Royal Assent ceremony takes place in the Senate, as the sovereign is traditionally barred from the House of Commons. On the day of the event, the Speaker of the Senate will read to the chamber a notice from the secretary to the governor general indicating when the viceroy or a deputy thereof will arrive. The Senate thereafter cannot adjourn until after the ceremony. The speaker moves to sit beside the throne; the Mace Bearer, with mace in hand, stands adjacent to him or her; and the governor general enters to take the speaker's chair. The Usher of the Black Rod is then commanded by the speaker to summon the members of parliament, who follow Black Rod back to the Senate, the Sergeant-at-Arms carrying the mace of the House of Commons. In the Senate, those from the commons stand behind the bar, while Black Rod proceeds to stand next to the governor general, who then nods his or her head to signify Royal Assent to the presented bills (which do not include appropriations bills). Once the list of bills is complete, the Clerk of the Senate states: \"in Her Majesty's name, His [or Her] Excellency the Governor General [or the deputy] doth assent to these bills.\" If there are any appropriation bills to receive Royal Assent, the Speaker of the House of Commons will read their titles and the Senate clerk repeats them to the governor general, who nods his or her head to communicate Royal Assent. When these bills have all been assented to, the Clerk of the Senate recites \"in Her Majesty's name, His [or Her] Excellency the Governor General [or the deputy] thanks her loyal subjects, accepts their benevolence and assents to these bills.\" The governor general or his or her deputy then depart parliament.\n\nIn some monarchies—such as Belgium, Denmark, Japan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and Thailand—promulgation is required as well as royal assent. In Sweden, however, the monarch is since 1975 removed from the process and the Government (i.e the cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister) officially promulgates laws. In both cases, however, the process of assent and promulgation is usually a formality, whether by constitutional convention or by an explicit provision of the constitution.\n\nAccording to Article 109 of the constitution: \"The King \"sanctions\" and \"promulgates\" laws\". In Belgium, the royal assent is called \"sanction royale\" / \"koninklijke bekrachtiging\" (Royal Sanction), and is granted by the King signing the proposed statute. The Belgian constitution requires a theoretically possible refusal of royal sanction to be countersigned—as any other act of the monarch—by a minister responsible before the House of Representatives. The monarch promulgates the law, meaning that he or she formally orders that the law be officially published and executed. In 1990, when King Baudouin advised his cabinet he could not, in conscience, sign a bill decriminalising abortion (a refusal patently not covered by a responsible minister), the Council of Ministers, at the King's own request, declared Baudouin incapable of exercising his powers. In accordance with the Belgian constitution, upon the declaration of the sovereign's incapacity, the Council of Ministers assumed the powers of the head of state until parliament could rule on the King's incapacity and appoint a regent. The bill was then assented to by all members of the Council of Ministers \"on behalf of the Belgian People\". In a joint meeting, both houses of parliament declared the King capable of exercising his powers again the next day.\n\nThe constitution of Jordan grants its monarch the right to withhold assent to laws passed by its parliament. Article 93 of that document gives the Jordanian sovereign six months to sign or veto any legislation sent to him from the National Assembly; if he vetoes it within that timeframe, the assembly may override his veto by a two-thirds vote of both houses; otherwise, the law does not go into effect (but it may be reconsidered in the next session of the assembly). If the monarch fails to act within six months of the bill being presented to him, it becomes law without his signature.\n\nAccording to Article 9 of the Constitution of Liechtenstein, \"every law shall require the sanction of the Reigning Prince to attain legal force.\" Liechtenstein allows its monarch to withhold royal assent of his own will. When Prince Hans Adam II, in an unprecedented move for the constitutional monarchy, refused to give royal assent to a bill legalising abortion, he pushed for a bill to give him sweeping powers in the government beyond only ceremonial matters, including the power to appoint judges. The bill passed and the Prince now has many additional powers, including the power to withhold royal assent on his own accord.\n\nWhile Article 34 of the constitution of Luxembourg formerly required the grand duke or duchess to \"sanction\" and \"promulgate\" a new law for it to take effect, the required sanction was removed in 2008, after Grand Duke Henri informed his prime minister that he could not in good conscience assent to a bill to permit euthanasia in the country. The subsequent constitutional amendment removed the need for assent while retaining the need for the Grand Duke to promulgate new laws. The Grand-Duke's signature is still required, but does not imply assent, only promulgation (announcement that the law has been enacted by Parliament). The Grand-Duke did sign the Euthanasia Act under this new constitutional arrangement.\n\nRoyal assent in the Netherlands is required, under article 87 of the Dutch constitution, for a bill to become law. After a law has been approved by the Council of Ministers and has received a positive advice from the advisory Council of State, the government then sends it to the lower house of parliament in the name of the monarch with the following text:\n\nAfter the House of Representatives has debated the law, it either approves it and sends it to the Senate with the text \"The Second Chamber of the States General sends the following approved proposal of law to the First Chamber\", or it rejects it and returns it to the government with the text \"The Second Chamber of the States General has rejected the accompanying proposal of law.\" If the upper house then approves the law, it sends it back to the government with the text \"To the King, The States General have accepted the proposal of law as it is offered here.\"\n\nThe government, consisting of the monarch and the ministers, will then usually approve the proposal and the sovereign and one of the ministers signs the proposal with the addition of an enacting clause, thereafter notifying the States General that \"The King assents to the proposal.\" It has happened in exceptional circumstances that the government does not approve a law that has been passed in parliament. In such a case, neither the monarch nor a minister will sign the bill, notifying the States General that \"The King will keep the proposal under advisement.\" A law that has received royal assent will be published in the State Magazine, with the original being kept in the archives of the King's Offices.\n\nArticles 77–79 of the Norwegian Constitution specifically grant the monarch of Norway the right to withhold royal assent from any bill passed by the Storting. Should the sovereign ever choose to exercise this privilege, Article 79 provides a means by which his veto may be over-ridden: \"If a Bill has been passed unaltered by two sessions of the Storting, constituted after two separate successive elections and separated from each other by at least two intervening sessions of the Storting, without a divergent Bill having been passed by any Storting in the period between the first and last adoption, and it is then submitted to the King with a petition that His Majesty shall not refuse his assent to a Bill which, after the most mature deliberation, the Storting considers to be beneficial, it shall become law even if the Royal Assent is not accorded before the Storting goes into recess.\"\n\nIn Part II of the 1978 Spanish constitution, among provisions concerning the Crown, Article 62(a) invests the \"sanction\" (i.e. Royal Assent) and \"promulgation\" of laws with the monarch of Spain. Chapter 2 of Part III, concerning the Drafting of Bills, outlines the method by which bills are passed. According to Article 91, the monarch shall give his or her assent and promulgate the new law within fifteen days of passage of a bill by the Cortes Generales. Article 92 invests the monarch with the right to call for a referendum, on the advice of the president of the government (commonly referred to in English as the prime minister) and the authorisation of the cortes.\n\nNo provision within the constitution grants the monarch an ability to veto legislation directly; however, no provision prohibits the sovereign from withholding royal assent, which effectively constitutes a veto. When the Spanish media asked King Juan Carlos if he would endorse the bill legalising same-sex marriages, he answered \"Soy el Rey de España y no el de Bélgica\" (\"I am the King of Spain and not that of Belgium\")—a reference to King Baudouin I of Belgium, who had refused to sign the Belgian law legalising abortion. The King gave royal assent to Law 13/2005 on 1 July 2005; the law was gazetted in the \"Boletín Oficial del Estado\" on 2 July and came into effect on 3 July 2005. Likewise, in 2010, King Juan Carlos gave royal assent to a law permitting abortion.\n\nIf the Spanish monarch ever refused in conscience to grant royal assent, a procedure similar to the Belgian handling of King Baudouin's objection would not be possible under the current constitution. If the sovereign were ever declared incapable of discharging royal authority, his or her powers would not be transferred to the Cabinet, pending the parliamentary appointment of a regency. Instead, the constitution mandates the next person of age in the line of succession would immediately become regent. Therefore, had Juan Carlos followed the Belgian example in 2005 or 2010, a declaration of incapacity would have transferred power to Felipe, then the heir apparent.\n\nArticles 41 and 68 of the constitution empower the sovereign to withhold royal assent from bills adopted by the Legislative Assembly. In 2010, the kingdom moved towards greater democracy, with King George Tupou V saying that he would be guided by his prime minister in the exercising of his powers. Nonetheless, this does not preclude an independent royal decision to exercise a right of veto. In November 2011, the assembly adopted an Arms and Ammunitions (Amendment) Bill, which reduced the possible criminal sentences for the illicit possession of firearms. The bill was adopted by ten votes to eight. Two members of the assembly had recently been charged with the illicit possession of firearms. The Prime Minister, Lord Tuʻivakanō, voted in favour of the amendment. Members of the opposition denounced the bill and asked the King to veto it, which he did in December.\n\nIn certain republican constitutions, royal assent has developed into the possibility of a \"presidential veto\", such as in the United States of America or in several European countries.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "890587", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=890587", "title": "Statute of Monopolies", "text": "Statute of Monopolies\n\nThe Statute of Monopolies was an Act of the Parliament of England notable as the first statutory expression of English patent law. Patents evolved from letters patent, issued by the monarch to grant monopolies over particular industries to skilled individuals with new techniques. Originally intended to strengthen England's economy by making it self-sufficient and promoting new industries, the system gradually became seen as a way to raise money (through charging patent-holders) without having to incur the public unpopularity of a tax. Elizabeth I particularly was a great abuser of the system, issuing patents for common commodities such as starch and salt. Unrest eventually persuaded her to turn the administration of patents over to the common law courts, but her successor, James I, was even more abusive. Despite a committee established to investigate grievances and excesses, Parliament made several efforts to further curtail the monarch's power. The result was the Statute of Monopolies, passed on 29 May 1624.\n\nThe statute repealed some past and future patents and monopolies but preserved exceptions: one of these was for patents for novel inventions. Seen as a key moment in the evolution of patent law, the statute has also been described as \"one of the landmarks in the transition of [England's] economy from the feudal to the capitalist\". Even with the statute in force, it took over a century for a comprehensive legal doctrine around patents to come into existence, and James I's successor Charles I regularly abused the patents system by ensuring that all cases relating to his actions were heard in conciliar courts, which he controlled. The English Civil War and the resulting English Restoration finally curtailed this system of abuse. The statute is still the basis for Australian law, and until the United Kingdom began following the European Patent Convention in 1977, was also a strong pillar of the United Kingdom's intellectual property law.\n\nHistorically, English patent law was based on custom and the common law, not on statute. It began as the Crown granted patents as a form of economic protection to ensure high industrial production. As gifts from the crown, there was no judicial review, oversight or consideration, and no actual law developed around patents. This practice came from the guilds, groups who were controlled by the Crown and held monopolies over particular industries. By the 14th century the economy of England was lagging behind that of other European nations, with the guilds too small to control industrial production successfully. To remedy this, Edward II began encouraging foreign workmen and inventors to settle in England, offering \"letters of protection\" that protected them from guild policy on the condition that they train English apprentices and pass on their knowledge. The first recorded letter of protection was given in 1331. The letters did not grant a full monopoly; rather they acted as an extended passport, allowing foreign workers to travel to England and practice their trade. An exceptional example (considered the first full patent in England) was issued to John of Utynam on 3 April 1449, granting him a monopoly. Overseas, the practice of granting full industrial patents and monopolies became common in Italian states by the 1420s.\n\nOver the next century, the granting of full industrial patents became a more common practice in England; the next record is a letter from 1537 to Thomas Cromwell, Henry VIII's private secretary, from Antonio Guidotti, a Venetian silk-merchant. Guidotti had persuaded a group of Venetian silk-makers to practice in England, and wanted the king to grant him letters patent protecting their monopoly to grow silk for 15 or 20 years. This was granted, and Henry's son Edward VI followed up with a grant of letters patent to Henry Smyth, who hoped to introduce foreign glassworking techniques into England. This process continued after Elizabeth I came to the throne, with formal procedures set out in 1561 to issue letters patent to any new industry, allowing monopolies. The granting of these patents was highly popular with the monarch, both before and after the statute of Monopolies, because of the potential for raising revenue. A patentee was expected to pay heavily for the patent, and unlike a tax raise (another method of raising Crown money) any public unrest as a result of the patent was normally directed at the patentee, not the monarch.\n\nOver time, this became more and more problematic; instead of temporary monopolies on specific, imported industries, long-term monopolies came about over more common commodities, including salt and starch. These \"odious monopolies\" led to a showdown between the Crown and Parliament, in which it was agreed in 1601 to turn the power to administer patents over to the common law courts; at the same time, Elizabeth revoked a number of the more restrictive and damaging monopolies. Even given a string of judicial decisions criticising and overruling such monopolies, James I, Elizabeth I's successor, continued using patents to create monopolies. Despite the Committee of Grievances, a body chaired by Sir Edward Coke that abolished a large number of monopolies, a wave of protest occurred at the expansion of the system. On 27 March 1621, James suggested the House of Commons draw up a list of the three most objectionable patents, and he would \"give Life to it, without alteration\", but by this time a statute was already being prepared by Coke. After passing on 12 May 1621 it was thrown out by the House of Lords, but a statute of Monopolies was finally passed by Parliament on 29 May 1624.\n\nSection 1 said that: Crucially, this rendered all past, present and future patents and monopolies null and void. Patents were normally divided into three categories; patents for a particular invention, patents exempting a patent-holder from legislation, and patents for a particular trade or industry. Section 1, however, for the first time discussed a new category of patents; those \"of Power, Liberty or Faculty\". These patents were normally used in relation to penal laws, to \"farm out\" the business of administering to criminals and dispensing justice to private companies and individuals. The statute, in a break from previous law, emphasised that this power lay only within Parliament. Section 2 provided that all future patents granted should be determined by the common law, and not otherwise, while Section 3 emphasised that companies and individuals now or in the future in possession of patents should not be allowed to exercise them. Sections 4 and 5 provided that if anyone was interfered with 40 days after the Statute of Monopolies was passed due to a patent or monopoly, any goods seized or persons imprisoned would be returned to their owners and released respectively.\n\nThe most important part of the statute is Section 6, which lays out the exceptions to the rules preventing any kind of monopoly or patent. It stated that the previous provisions: Essentially, this established a wide area in which patents could be granted, on the condition that monopolies lasted no longer than 14 years. These patents would apply to any new \"manner\" of \"manufacture\", with \"manufacture\" referring both to the creation of an object, and the design for that object. Section 7 provided that the Act did not prejudice or overrule any previous statutory measures, while Section 8 provided that the restoration to Parliament of the power to administer penal law did not in any way infringe upon the right of the king, Court of King's Bench, Court of Common Pleas or other criminal courts to order someone's imprisonment. Section 9 provided that the rejection of letters patent and licenses did not extend to corporations over towns, such as the City of London Corporation.\n\nThe statute is worded \"strongly and broadly\", and other than the exceptions mainly repeated the existing common law. The statute has long been considered a key moment in patent law; Chris Dent, writing in the \"Melbourne University Law Review\", identifies it as \"a significant marker in the history of patents\" with continuing importance, although it is neither the start nor end of patent law. Despite the statute, the courts did not develop a comprehensive and coherent legal doctrine for patent law for more than a century after the statute came into force. Not only is it highly important within patent law, it also played a large role in economics; G. A. Bloxam, writing in the \"Journal of Industrial Economics\", identifies the passage of the Statute of Monopolies as \"one of the landmarks in the transition of [England's] economy from the feudal to the capitalist\".\n\nAs well as being significant in relation to patent law, Whig historians have also identified it as the first infringement upon the monarch's Royal Prerogative, and one of the first occasions in which the self-confident House of Commons overruled the king, eventually leading to the English Civil War. Chris R. Kyle, writing in the \"Journal of Legal History\", notes that this is not the case; not only did the Statute of Monopolies only restate the previous common law, leading to no infringement upon the Royal Prerogative, James I was in the later stages of the bill supportive of its principles. James I was not opposed to the motion; during the 1621 session of Parliament, he voided several monopolies (included those for silver thread and inns), and both James and the Privy Council were active during the passage of the bill to ensure it was supported.\n\nThe statute required extensive judicial action to make it work, particularly on the interpretation of Section 6. Sir Edward Coke, in his \"Institutes of the Lawes of England\", wrote that The subject was also discussed in \"Bircot's Case\", where it was decided that an inventive improvement to an existing industry or invention was not a new \"material\", and could not be patented; such an improvement was described as \"to put but a new button to an old coat\". \"Hasting's Case\" confirmed that a patent would not be issued, even for a new \"material\", that was extremely close to an old one, something originally laid down in \"Matthey's Case\". The statute did not stop the monarch issuing such patents in return for money; after James I's death, Charles I continued issuing them and avoided having to obey the law by having any cases heard in the conciliar courts, such as the Star Chamber. In response to this abuse and others, the Star Chamber was abolished by the Habeas Corpus Act 1640. After the English Restoration, these activities largely ceased because of the dominant power of Parliament and the Bill of Rights 1689, which completely abolished the king's ability to disobey or alter statute.\n\nThe Statute of Monopolies dominated patent law for centuries; it was received into the laws of many common law jurisdictions and still forms the basis for the modern patent laws of those countries: for example, the patent law of Australia is dominated by the Patents Act 1990, which states that one test for if something is patentable is if it relates to \"a manner of manufacture within the meaning of section 6 of the Statute of Monopolies\". \n\nIn England and Wales, some sections of the statute are still technically in force, although the Statute Law Revision Act 1863, Patents, Designs and Trade Marks Act 1883, Statute Law Revision Act 1948, Administration of Justice Act 1965 and Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1969 repealed most of the legislation. In practice however, with the Patents Act 1977 (which brought the United Kingdom into line with the European Patent Convention), the statute has been implicitly repealed within England and Wales.\n\n\n\n"}

At dinner Stuart was served a number of rum-and-cokes but showed no signs of intoxication. Afterwards the four discussed who should drive and Stuart insisted he was fit to drive, and so they agreed to let him drive. On the way back Stuart got them in an accident. Among the injuries, Gillian was rendered quadriplegic.\n\nAt trial the judge found that the dinner theatre could not have been aware of Stuart's degree of intoxication and did not impose liability based solely on the number of drinks served. On appeal the Court of Appeal overturned the decision and allocated 10% liability to the theatre. The court held that the Mayfield investments (owners of the theatre) did not breach the duty that they owed to Gillian Stewart.\n\nJustice Major, writing for the unanimous court, held that the theatre was not liable. Major J. examined the previous cases of \"Crocker v. Sundance Northwest Resorts Ltd.\" and \"Jordan House Ltd. v. Menow\", finding that they confirmed the existence of a duty to third parties who are reasonably expected to pose a risk.\n\nA breach of the duty is only where there was a foreseeable risk of harm. Here, there was no reasonable way that the theatre could foresee that Stuart would be the one to drive since he was accompanied by three individuals, two of them sober. The theatre was correct in assuming that Stuart would not be the one to drive. Nevertheless, Major confirmed that the theatre must monitor the patron's alcohol consumption based on the amount served and not solely on the patron's visible condition.\n\nIn an obiter dictum, Major mused that even if there was a breach of the standard of care, it was not clear if a warning by Mayfield would have resulted in a different choice of driver.\n\n\n"}

In Italy, discussions on \"poetic theology\" were articulated most notably by Boccaccio and Petrarch, both of whom promoted a philosophical life capable of withstanding the inquisitorial scrutiny of theological orthodoxy.\n\nThe Italian appeal to poetic theology finds its historical consummation in the works of Giambattista Vico, and most notably in his Scienza Nuova (1730 and 1744), where the political philosopher highlights the independence of pre-philosophical poetic theologians (\"authors of gentile nations\") from Biblical revelation, and thus too, Christianity's sacred history. Vico argues at length that the \"authors\" (\"autori\") of civil society preceded by far its \"writers\" (\"scrittori\"), so that a problematic hiatus separates the two, as it does things and the records we have of them in words. Vico's enterprise consists of discovering the inherence of order in things—and of \"right in human nature\"—lest order and right be conceived as merely imposed upon things by \"writers\" according to their whims (\"a placito\"), as is the case with all dogmatic theology, but also—so argues Vico already in his \"De Antiquissima Italorum Sapientia\"—with modern \"science,\" insofar as it identifies what is true with what is \"most certain\" (\"certissima\").\n\nWhile Vico's references to \"poet theologians\" (\"poeti teologi\") point overtly to pre-philosophical authorities, Vico presents himself, if only tacitly or obliquely, as a poet theologian in his own right. In this respect, as Paolo Cristofolini has shown, Vico recognizes himself as a \"new Dante,\" or a poet theologian who is at once a philosopher. Vico's own \"Scienza Nuova\" presents itself—most notably in the first and last paragraphs of the work—as discovering the providence of a \"metaphysical\" human mind in the world of human wills (\"animi umani\"). If our own intellect (\"intelligenza\") is at work in us prior to our recognizing it (indeed even when we live as brutes), philosophy too must \"covertly\" precede sensory experience as the hidden author of our world (hence Vico's dictum, included in his \"De Antiquissima Italorum Sapientia\", Ch. VII.3, to the effect that just as God is the artifex of nature, so is man the God of artifices: \"ut Deus sit naturae artifex, homo artificiorum Deus\"). \n\nwww.theologiapoetica.webs.com\n"}
{"id": "20704115", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20704115", "title": "Transitional phrase", "text": "Transitional phrase\n\nA transitional phrase, in United States patent law, is a phrase that links the preamble of a patent claim to the specific elements set forth in the claim which define what the invention itself actually is. The transitional phrase acts as a limitation on the claim, indicating whether a similar device, method, or composition infringes the patent if it contains more or fewer elements than the claim in the patent.\n\nThere are three kinds of transitional phrases: open, closed, and hybrid.\n\nA closed transition usually uses the words \"consisting of\". Use of this phrase limits the preamble to exactly what follows and nothing more. An example would be a patent claim for a pencil, which might say in the preamble \"a writing device\", followed by the closed transition \"consisting of\", and concluding with a description such as \"a cylindrical piece of lead, graphite, or another material similarly capable of leaving a mark when drawn against a surface, and a second surrounding material encasing the first\". A third party who sold pencils including both a cylinder of writing material and a casing material, but added to his pencils an eraser fixed to one end, would therefore not be in violation of the patent. Use of such a transition makes it easy for a competitor to compete with the patented product without infringing it, because it allows the competitor to sell a similar device so long as the competitor makes an addition to what is claimed. However, it also may assist the patent owner in avoiding prior art, which might otherwise block the patent from issuing. A common transition that we see all the time is in subtraction and is one of the most obscure transition words. This is used for a counterargument in an essay.\n\nAn open transition usually uses the word \"comprises\" or \"comprising\". This is the broadest form of transition, as it does not limit the preamble to whatever elements are identified in the claim. If the above patent used the word \"comprising\" instead of \"consisting of\", then the third party's pencil-plus-eraser would be infringing (assuming that the patent is otherwise valid).\n\nA third kind of transition, the hybrid transition, uses the phrase \"consisting essentially of\". The effect of this transitional phrase is to leave the claim \"open\" to include additional elements, but only if those additional elements do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristics of the claimed combination. In this instance, the pencil with the eraser added might still not be infringing, but a pencil with a fin or a non-functional button would still infringe, because the thing that was added would serve no purpose material to the claimed functions of the pencil. This language assists in avoiding prior art, but is broad enough to capture imperfect attempts to copy the patented device.\n\n\n"}

It ended the Granada War which had started in 1482, culminating in the siege and battle of Granada beginning in spring 1491.\n\nAlso known as the Capitulation of Granada, the treaty provided a short truce, followed by the relinquishment in January 1492 of the sovereignty of the Moorish Emirate of Granada (founded five centuries earlier) to the Catholic monarchs of Spain. The treaty guaranteed a set of rights to the Moors, including religious tolerance and fair treatment in return for their surrender and capitulation.\n\nThe Catholics' subsequent policy inviting the Moors to either convert or be expelled triggered an uprising by the Moors in 1500, and the Catholic side used this uprising to argue that the Moors had violated the Treaty and justify revoking its provisions. See Morisco rebellions in Granada.\n\nThe capitulation of 1492 contained sixty-seven articles among which were the following:\n\nInitially, the Catholic conquerors implemented and reinforced the generous terms of the treaty. A joint municipal council was established in Granada, and the Muslims were allowed to elect their own representatives. Despite pressure from the Spanish clergy, Ferdinand chose a laissez-faire policy towards the Muslim in the hope that interaction with Catholics will make them \"understand the error\" of their faith and abandon it. Hernando de Talavera, a friar of converso origins known for his moderation and piety, was appointed as the archbishop of Granada. He was known for his preference of preaching based on \"Catholic reasoning\" as opposed to \"punishments and lashes\". When Ferdinand and Isabella visited the city in the summer of 1499, they were greeted by enthusiastic crowd, including Muslims.\n\nAt the same time, cardinal Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros, the archbishop of Toledo, arrived in Granada and began working alongside Talavera. Cisneros disliked Talavera's approach, and began sending uncooperative Muslims, especially the noblemen, to prison where they were treated harshly until they agreed to convert. Emboldened by the increase in conversions, Cisneros intensified the efforts and in December 1499 he told Pope Alexander VI that three thousand Muslims converted in a single day. Cisneros' own church council warned that these methods might be a breach of the Treaty, and sixteenth-century hagiographer Álvar Gómez de Castro described the approach as \"methods that were not correct\".\n\nIn December 1499, amid the increasingly forced conversions and triggered by an incident involving an attempt by the authorities to reconvert a Muslim woman who had converted from Christianity, the population of Albayzín (the Muslim quarter of Granada) began an open and armed revolt. Talavera and Captain-General Tendilla resolved the situation by negotiating with the Muslims. Meanwhile, Cisneros was summoned to the court in Seville to account for his actions. He convinced the Catholic monarchs to issue a collective pardons on the rebels, on condition that they convert to Christianity. Consequently, the whole city of Granada nominally became Christian, and the treaty began to unravel.\n\n\n"}

He was a professor at the Faculty of Law, University of Oslo from 1963 to 1971 and at the Department of Sociology from 1971 to 1988. He co-founded the Norwegian Institute for Social Research already in 1950, and has been labelled the \"father of Norwegian sociology\". In his early life he was a member of the anti-Nazi resistance group XU, and while later involved on the radical wing of the Labour Party, he edited the newspaper \"Orientering\".\n\nVilhelm Aubert was born in Kristiania in 1922. He was the older brother of mathematician Karl Egil Aubert, born 1924. Vilhelm Aubert enrolled at the University of Oslo in 1940, the same year as Norway was invaded by Germany as a part of the Second World War. Aubert became a member of the illegal intelligence organization XU.\n\nAubert finally graduated with the cand.jur. degree in 1946. He then lived in the United States for two years, studying sociology and psychology at Columbia and Berkeley. After returning to Norway, he was instrumental in the foundation and consolidation of social science research in Norway, a still fledgling field. He was a joint founder of the Norwegian Institute for Social Research (ISF, or \"Institutt for samfunnsforsking\"), an independent research institute in Oslo, along with Arne Næss, Eirik Rinde, and Stein Rokkan in 1950.\n\nAubert was a member of the Labour Party in his younger days. Situated on its left wing, he co-published the pamphlet \"Tenk en gang til. Tanker om fred og nedrustning\" in 1952, and was among the founders of the newspaper \"Orientering\". He was the editor-in-chief of the newspaper for some time. The persons in and around this newspaper were excluded from the Labour Party in 1960, following a turbulent existence as an internal party opposition, especially in foreign policy issues. Some of the excluded members went on to found the Socialist People's Party, whereas Aubert left partisan politics to concentrate on an academic career. However, he continued his opposition towards nuclear arms.\n\nHe took the doctor's degree in 1954, with the thesis \"Straffens sosiale funksjon\" (The Social Function of Punishment), which was also selected for the Norwegian Sociology Canon in 2009–2011. In it, he discussed the preventive nature of laws and punishment. In the same year he was hired as a lecturer at the University of Oslo. He was promoted to professor of the sociology of law in 1963. This institution was, and still is, a part of the Faculty of Law. Books in the field of sociology of law include \"Likhet og rett\" (1963), \"Rettssosiologi\" (1968) and \"Rettens sosiale funksjon\" (1976). \"Continuity and Development in Law and Society\" was published posthumously in 1989.\n\nHe later moved to the Department of Sociology at the Faculty of Social Sciences at Blindern, as a professorship in general sociology was established in 1971. His textbook \"Sosiologi\", published in 1964, was the authoritative introduction to sociology in Norway for many years. His book \"The Hidden Society\" from 1965 was inspired by symbolic interactionism and the Chicago school.\n\nAubert died in July 1988 during a hiking trip.\n\nHe held an honorary degree at the Faculty of Law of the University of Edinburgh, issued in 1971. He has been credited for his contributions to the sociology of law, and some have labelled him the \"father of Norwegian sociology\" in general.\n\nLater researchers have noted his tendency to stress the importance of norms. He has been criticized for maintaining a thin line between research and activism in some of his works. Aubert's employment of action research has been attributed to his left-wing political stance.\n\n"}

Wildlife in Belize is defined as any undomesticated mammal, reptile or bird, amphibian and any egg, nest or part or product thereof. Although Belize is only two hundred miles long and a little more than sixty miles wide, it hosts a remarkable abundance of flora and fauna. It is the home of more than 150 species of mammals, 549 birds, 150 amphibians and reptiles, nearly 600 species of freshwater and marine fish and 3,408 species of vascular plants.\n\nThe Forest Department under the Ministry of Forestry, Fisheries and Sustainable Development is the regulatory body that enforces the Wildlife Protection Act. The Wildlife Protection Act's main goal is to rescue the over one hundred globally threatened species in Belize from local extinction. The National List of Critical Native Species includes 11 Critically Endangered Species, 31 Endangered Species and 63 Vulnerable Species.\n\nIn Belize, threats to wildlife from the illegal wildlife trade have been, in general, historically marginal; Belize has low population pressure and large wilderness areas. Parrots are the major species threatened by the wildlife trade. People of all classes keep pet parrots; however, in 2016 the Government of Belize closed the amnesty period for registering parrots already in captivity and began prohibiting the ownership of newly-captured baby parrots under the National Captive Wildlife permit program. Although the government of Belize has imposed conservation measures, the increasing human population of Belize and forest clearance and fragmentation have pressured wildlife; the percentage of forest cover in Belize has declined from 74.4% in 1980 to 60.3% in 2014.\n\nIn the last five years, the Forest Department has adopted a Wildlife Conservation Program (abbreviated to WCP), which provides active management and protection of wildlife. The legal authority for the Wildlife Conservation Program comes from the Wildlife Protection Act. The Program is responsible for implementing the Convention on Biological Diversity, to which Belize is a party, and meeting Belize's obligation to maintain its threatened species, including those targeted by the wildlife trade. It is also a party to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which limits trade in threatened wildlife through the CITES permission system. The Wildlife Program enforces these treaties through measures that protect wildlife from hunting, poaching and other extraction activities.\n\nTo accomplish its conservation-related goals, the Belize Forest Department has a Memorandum of Understandings with rehabilitation and conservation organisations in Belize including Belize Bird Rescue, Wildtracks Rehabilitation Program (Primate and Manatee), The Belize Zoo, The Green Iguana Project, Belize Raptor Center, Friends for Conservation and Development (FCD), The Belize Wildlife and Referral Clinic, American Crocodile Education Sanctuary, and Sea to Shore Alliance.\n\nThe Forest Department has also implemented closed and open seasons for popular hunted games species such as deer (male and female), armadillo, gibnut, peccaries, iguanas and game birds.\n\n"}
