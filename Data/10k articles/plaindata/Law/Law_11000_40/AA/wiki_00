The scheme was similar to the way banks were required to withhold an amount at a set rate on interest earned on bank deposits before it is paid to the account holder.\n\nIn general, this payment meant that the recipients of the dividend were considered to have already paid basic rate tax on the dividend income. Non-taxpayers, such as pension funds, who would not otherwise have paid income tax on the dividend income, became entitled to claim a refund of the ACT amount, or after 1993 a lesser amount. The refund of ACT for non-taxpayers was scrapped in 1997, but in 1999 ACT was itself scrapped, effectively making dividend income of non-taxpayers tax-free again.\n\nThe amount of ACT paid by a company could also be offset against the company's profits reducing its final corporation tax bill. ACT was scrapped in 1999.\n\nUntil 1973, company profits were taxed as profits, and dividend payments were then taxed as income. In 1973, a partial imputation system was introduced for dividend payments, under which companies were required to withhold tax on dividends, called an advance corporation tax, before they were distributed to shareholders. UK companies could set off the ACT amount withheld against the overall company tax liability, subject to certain limits. (The full amount of ACT paid could not be recovered if significantly large amounts of profits were distributed.) Shareholders of a UK company who received a dividend received a tax credit representing the ACT paid, which could be set off against their overall income tax liability. Non-taxable shareholders, such as pension funds, were entitled to a refund of the ACT amount.\n\nWhen introduced in 1973, the ACT rate on the gross dividend (the amount distributed plus the ACT withheld) was 30%, the basic rate of income tax at the time. Until 1993 the income tax rate payable on dividends was the same as all other income, and the ACT rate was adjusted to align it to changes in the basic rate of income tax. From April 1993, the ACT rate was cut to 22.5% while the tax rate on dividend income was set at 20%, the first time it was set at a different rate to that payable on other income (25%). The tax credit was tied to the 20% rate rather than the ACT rate of 22.5%, meaning that non-taxpayers could no longer claim a refund for the full amount that had previously been paid as ACT. The ACT rate was cut to 20% from April 1994.\n\nIn 1997, the tax credit was scrapped for non-taxpayers (except charities and PEPs), which had a particular impact on pension funds, which could no longer claim a refund for any amount that had previously been paid as ACT. The effect of the change was that pension funds became effectively taxed on dividend income by way of the now non-refundable ACT, thus lowering pension returns and allegedly resulting in the winding up of some pension funds. Treasury argued that the change was crucial to long-term economic growth: the existing corporation tax system created biased incentives for corporations to pay out profits as dividends to shareholders (including pension funds, who could then reclaim the tax paid) rather than to reinvest them into company growth (which would result in corporation tax being paid). The old system of corporation tax was widely viewed by economists as a constraint on British economic growth. \"The Times\" obtained documents under the Freedom of Information Act in April 2007 that showed the chancellor Gordon Brown had been advised that pension funds would suffer a £67 billion loss of the actuarial value of their assets as a net result of a combination of policies including the ACT change.\n\nACT was scrapped from 6 April 1999, and replaced by a tax credit on dividend income of 10%. From 6 April 2016, the tax credit was itself abolished and replaced with a tax-free dividend allowance of £5,000.\n\n\n"}

He was considered as a political prisoner by international organizations including Amnesty International and Council of Europe. After demands from the Council of Europe, Hummatov was granted retrials, yet according to Human Rights Watch report, the authorities conducted him inside prisons, and with procedural violations.\n\nHummatov finished Polytechnic Institute of Baku. He participated in different parties, including Popular Front of Azerbaijan. Hummatov, who was \"seen by many Azeris as a dangerous separatist\", was the leader of the self-declared Talysh-Mughan Autonomous Republic which existed briefly in the south of Azerbaijan at a time of political instability in 1993.\n\nIn 1995 Hummatov was sentenced to death by the Azerbaijani court, later commuted to life imprisonment, on a range of charges including treason. In an open letter to the president Ilham Aliyev, Sidiki Kaba, the president of the International Federation of Human Rights, wrote, that Hummatov and Qaziyez \"are being held in Qobustan prison. Their prison system is very strict and sentences them to isolation. In fact, under the pretext of protecting their physical integrity, these two prisoners have been locked up alone, in closed cells at night, which prevents them from receiving medical assistance throughout the night in the case a problem should arise.\" In prison Hummatov fell ill with tuberculosis and lost almost all of his teeth. He was among those identified in 2001 by the Council of Europe, as political prisoners who should either be released or retried. In 2004 Hummatov has been pardoned by president Aliev, was deprived by the Azerbaijani citizenship and sent to the Netherlands where his family lives.\n\nAfter emigrating to the Netherlands, Hummatov made two applications against the Republic of Azerbaijan to the European Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. On 29 November 2007 the court has sentenced the state of Azerbaijan to pay the applicant 12,000 Euros in respect of non-pecuniary damage and 2,090 euros in respect of costs and expenses.\n\nHummatov continues to campaign in exile for the rights of the Talysh people. In September 2013, he visited the self-proclaimed Republic of Artsakh, two decades after confronting Karabakh and Armenian forces on the battlefield. He met with university students in Stepanakert, where he criticized the current Azerbaijani government and called for a peaceful resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, stating \"I believe that we must do everything to establish peace in the region so that our beloved children live, create and study in peaceful conditions.\" Hummatov referred to the region as Artsakh, the ancient Armenian name, and also met with the Parliament Speaker of Nagorno-Karabakh, Ashot Ghulian. He traveled to Karabakh from Armenia, where he inaugurated a graduate program of Talysh studies at the Yerevan State University on 24 September 2013.\n\nHummatov is married to Sudaba Rasulova. They have 2 sons. According to Rasulova, neither she, nor her children know Talysh language, and the only language of communication in their family is Azerbaijani. Rasulova stated that she was unaware of Hummatov's plans to visit Armenia, and she does not understand why her husband traveled there.\n\n"}
{"id": "19254314", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19254314", "title": "Bank regulation in the United States", "text": "Bank regulation in the United States\n\nBank regulation in the United States is highly fragmented compared with other G10 countries, where most countries have only one bank regulator. In the U.S., banking is regulated at both the federal and state level. Depending on the type of charter a banking organization has and on its organizational structure, it may be subject to numerous federal and state banking regulations. Apart from the bank regulatory agencies the U.S. maintains separate securities, commodities, and insurance regulatory agencies at the federal and state level, unlike Japan and the United Kingdom (where regulatory authority over the banking, securities and insurance industries is combined into one single financial-service agency). Bank examiners are generally employed to supervise banks and to ensure compliance with regulations.\n\nU.S. banking regulation addresses privacy, disclosure, fraud prevention, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, anti-usury lending, and the promotion of lending to lower-income populations. Some individual cities also enact their own financial regulation laws (for example, defining what constitutes usurious lending).\n\nA bank's primary federal regulator could be the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board, or the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Within the Federal Reserve System are 12 districts centered around 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks, each of which carries out the Federal Reserve Board's regulatory responsibilities in its respective district. Credit unions are subject to most bank regulations and are supervised by the National Credit Union Administration. The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) establishes uniform principles, standards, and report forms for the other agencies.\n\nState regulation of state-chartered banks and certain non-bank affiliates of federally chartered banks applies in addition to federal regulation. State-chartered banks are subject to the regulation of the state regulatory agency of the state in which they were chartered. For example, a California state bank that is not a member of the Federal Reserve System would be regulated by both the California Department of Financial Institutions and the FDIC. Likewise, a Nevada state bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System would be jointly regulated by the Nevada Division of Financial Institutions and the Federal Reserve.\n\nBy statute, and in accordance with judicial interpretation of statutes and the United States Constitution, federal banking statutes (and the regulations and other guidance issued by federal banking regulatory agencies) often preempt state laws regulating certain activities of nationally chartered banking institutions and their subsidiaries. Specific exceptions to the general rule of federal preemption exist such as some contract law, escheat law, and insurance law.\n\nOne example is the Office of Thrift Supervision preempting federal savings associations from certain state laws. 12 U.S.C. § 1464(n) authorizes fiduciary activities for federal savings associations, and specifies certain state law requirements that are applicable to federal savings associations. 12 C.F.R. §550.136(c) lists six types of state laws that, in certain specified circumstances, are not preempted with respect to federal savings associations.\n\n\"Regulation P\" governs the use of a customer's private data. Banks and other financial institutions must inform a consumer of their policy regarding personal information, and must provide an \"opt-out\" before disclosing data to a non-affiliated third party. The regulation was enacted in 1999.\n\nConcerning know your customer rules and Bank Secrecy Act regulations, financial institutions are encouraged to keep track of customers employment status and other business dealings, including whether or not the financial activity of customers are consistent with their business activities, and report on customers' suspect activities to the government.\n\nAt its core, financial transparency requires financial institutions to implement certain basic controls:\n\n\nThe \"Bank Secrecy Act\" (BSA) requires financial institutions to assist government agencies to detect and prevent money laundering. Specifically, the act requires financial institutions to keep records of cash purchases of negotiable instruments, file reports of cash transactions exceeding $10,000 (daily aggregate amount), and to report suspicious activity that might signify money laundering, tax evasion or other criminal activities.\n\nSection 326 of the \"USA PATRIOT Act\" allows financial institutions to place limits on new accounts until the account holder's identity has been verified.\n\n\"Office of Foreign Assets Control\" (OFAC) \"sanctions\" apply to all U.S. entities including banks. The FFIEC provides guidelines to financial regulators for verifying compliance with the sanctions.\n\nThe \"Community Reinvestment Act\" of 1977 requires insured depository institutions to reinvest in the communities they serve. There should be an emphasis on low-income and moderate-income (LMI) census tracts and individuals. Insured depository institutions must display a CRA notice, and each branch must have a current CRA public file or access to it via the company's intranet, and must provide the information in person or by mail.\n\nThe United States was the second country (after Czechoslovakia) to officially enact deposit insurance to protect depositors from losses by insolvent banks. In 1933 the Glass–Steagall Act established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to insure deposits at commercial banks.\n\nIn 1970 Congress established a separate fund for credit unions, the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund. The NCUSIF insures all federally chartered credit unions and many state-chartered credit unions (98% as of 2009). Some others are insured by the private guaranty corporation American Share Insurance (156 as of 2009). In 1978 foreign banks operating in the United States were required to hold the same level of reserves under the specifications of the International Banking Act.\n\nIn 1934, Congress created the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation to insure savings and loan deposits. In the 1980s, during the savings and loan crisis, the FSLIC became insolvent and was abolished; its responsibility was transferred to the FDIC.\n\nSome financial institutions offer insurance in excess of FDIC or NCUA limits. For example, the Depositors Insurance Fund insures excess deposits at Massachusetts-chartered savings banks. American Share Insurance provides excess share insurance at participating credit unions.\n\nThe \"Truth in Savings Act\" (TISA), implemented by \"Regulation DD\", established uniformity in disclosing terms and conditions regarding interest and fees when giving out information and when opening a new savings account. On passing the law in 1991, Congress noted it would help promote economic stability, competition between depository institutions, and allow the consumer to make informed decisions.\n\nThe \"Expedited Funds Availability Act\" (EFAA) of 1987, implemented by \"Regulation CC\", defines when standard holds and exception holds can be placed on checks deposited to checking accounts, and the maximum length of time the money can be held. A bank's hold policy can be less stringent than the guidelines provided, but it cannot exceed the guidelines.\n\nThe \"Electronic Fund Transfer Act\" of 1978, implemented by \"Regulation E\", established the rights and liabilities of consumers as well as the responsibilities of all participants in electronic funds transfer activities.\n\n\nUntil 2011, \"Regulation Q\" prohibited banks from paying interest on demand deposit accounts. A \"demand deposit\" account includes many, but not all checking accounts, and does not include Negotiable Order of Withdrawal accounts (NOW accounts).\n\nThe \"Home Mortgage Disclosure Act\" (HMDA) of 1975, implemented by \"Regulation C\", requires financial institutions to maintain and annually disclose data about home purchases, home purchase pre-approvals, home improvement, and refinance applications involving one- to four-unit and multifamily dwellings. It also requires branches and loan centers to display a HMDA poster.\n\nThe \"Equal Credit Opportunity Act\" (ECOA) of 1974, implemented by \"Regulation B\", requires creditors which regularly extend credit to customers—including banks, retailers, finance companies, and bank-card companies—to evaluate candidates on creditworthiness alone, rather than other factors such as race, color, religion, national origin, or sex. Discrimination based on marital status, receipt of public assistance, and age is generally prohibited (with exceptions), as is discrimination based on a consumer's good-faith exercise of his or her credit-protection rights.\n\nThe \"Truth in Lending Act\" (TILA) of 1968, implemented by \"Regulation Z\", promotes the informed use of consumer credit by standardizing the disclosure of interest rates and other costs associated with borrowing. TILA also gives consumers the right to cancel certain credit transactions involving a lien on the consumer's principal dwelling, regulates certain credit-card practices, and provides a means of resolving credit-billing disputes.\n\nThe \"Fair Credit Reporting Act\" (FCRA) of 1970 regulates the collection, sharing, and use of customer-credit information. The act allows consumers to obtain a copy of their credit report from credit bureaus that hold information on them, provides for consumers to dispute negative information held and sets time limits, after which negative information is suppressed. It requires that consumers be informed when negative information is added to their credit records, and when adverse action is taken based on a credit report.\n\nProvisions addressing credit-card practices aim to enhance protections for consumers who use credit cards and improve credit-card disclosure under the Truth in Lending Act:\n\nLending-limit regulations restrict the total amount of loans and credits that a bank may extend to a single borrower. This restriction is usually stated as a percentage of the bank's capital or assets. For example, a national bank generally must limit its total outstanding loans and credits to any single borrower to no more than 15% of the bank's total capital and surplus. Some state banking regulations also contain similar lending limits applicable to state-chartered banks. Both federal and state laws generally allow for a higher lending limit (up to 25% of capital and surplus for national banks) when the portion of the credit that exceeds the initial lending limit is fully secured.\n\n\"Loans to Insiders (Regulation O)\" establishes various quantitative and qualitative limits and reporting requirements on extensions of credit made by a bank to its \"insiders\" or the insiders of the bank's affiliates. The term \"insiders\" includes executive officers, directors, principal shareholders and the related interests of such parties.\n\n\"Extensions of Credit by Federal Reserve Banks\" (Regulation A) establishes rules regarding discount window lending, the extension of credit by the Federal Reserve Bank to banks and other institutions. The Federal Reserve Board made significant amendments to Regulation A in 2003, including amendments to price certain discount-window lending at above-market rates and to restrict borrowing to banks in generally sound condition. In amending the regulation, the Federal Reserve Board noted that many banks had expressed their unwillingness to use discount-window borrowing because their use of such a funding source was interpreted as sign of the bank's financial weakness or distress. The Federal Reserve Board indicated its hope that the 2003 amendments would make discount window lending a more attractive funding option to banks.\n\n\"Transactions Between Member Banks and Their Affiliates (Regulation W)\" regulates transactions, such as loans and asset purchases between banks and their affiliates. The term \"affiliate\" is broadly defined and includes parent companies, companies that share a parent company with the bank, companies that are under other types of common control with the bank (e.g. by a trust), companies with interlocking directors (a majority of directors, trustees, etc. are the same as a majority of the bank's), subsidiaries, and certain other types of companies. When passed September 18, 1950 Regulation W included a prohibition on installment purchases exceeding 21 months, which was shortened to 15 months on October 16 of the same year.\n\nIn January 2018, a spokesperson for the Federal Reserve Board chief of supervision said that existing banking sector regulations were too tough and standardized, and could be relaxed and customized in order to promote commercial bank lending, investment, and stock market trading. Randal Quarles, the Vice Chairman for Bank Supervision, said he was planning several imminent changes that Wall Street has wanted involving capital rules, proprietary trading and a process known as “living wills” that aims to prevent taxpayer bailouts.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3152337", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3152337", "title": "Bava Kamma", "text": "Bava Kamma\n\nBava Kamma (Talmudic Aramaic: בבא קמא \"Bāḇā Qammā\", \"The First Gate\") is the first of a series of three Talmudic tractates in the order Nezikin (\"Damages\") that deal with civil matters such as damages and torts. The other two of these tractates are Bava Metzia and Bava Batra: originally all three formed a single tractate called \"Nezikin\", each \"Bava\" meaning \"part\" or \"subdivision\". Bava Kamma discusses various forms of damage and the compensation owed for them.\n\nBiblical laws dealing with the cases discussed in Bava Kamma are contained in the following passages: , and . The principle that underlies the legislation in this respect is expressed by the sentence, \"He that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution\". \n\nBava Kamma consists of ten chapters, which may be grouped as follows: damage caused without criminality (chaps. i–vi); damage caused by a criminal act (chaps. vii–x).\n\nTwo types of damages are dealt with: (1) damage caused by agents in their normal condition; (2) damage caused by agents in their abnormal condition. An instance of the first class of agents is an ox treading upon things that are in his way and thus damaging them, or eating things that are in his path. An instance of the second class is the case of a Goring Ox, as under normal circumstances an ox does not gore.\n\nThe Mishnah identifies four heads or agents of damage (\"\"avot nezikin\", literally, parents of damages): Ox, Pit, Ma'Aveh (meaning either damages caused by man, or those caused by an animal's feeding), Burning (\"Shor\",\" \"\"Bor\",\" \"\"Mav'eh\",\" \"Hev'er\"). These four agents correspond to those mentioned in [R. V. 5], , [A. V. 5–6].\n\nThe law concerning the compensation in these cases is expressed in the Mishnah (i. 1) thus: \"These four agents have in common the circumstance that they usually cause damage; that the owner has the duty to prevent the damage; and that if he fails to do so, on damage being done he must pay full compensation, with the best of his property\" (compare [A. V. 5]). Before, however, giving the detailed regulations for these four kinds of damage, the Mishnah proceeds to the discussion of the second class of damages, those caused by agents in an abnormal condition.\n\nThe principal distinction in the second class is between harmless (\"\"tam\") and warned (\"mu'ad\"\"). The law of compensation in these two cases is as follows: In the case of an animal previously reputed harmless (\"tam\"), the owner has to compensate for half the damage, unless half the damage exceeds the whole value of the animal causing the damage. In a case where the owner has been warned (\"mu'ad\"), he must give full compensation for the damage, without regard to the value of the damaging animal (compare ).\n\nThe law of \"mu'ad\" applies to the four kinds of damage done by animals or agents in their normal condition. In addition to these the Mishnah (i. 4) enumerates the following: man, and wild beasts owned by a man—such as the wolf, the lion, the bear, and the leopard; also the serpent. Of man it is said, \"Man is always fully responsible (\"mu'ad\"), whether he cause damage intentionally or unintentionally, whether awake or asleep\" (ii. 6). This rule is illustrated by various instances given in the third chapter (1–7).\n\nThe remaining part of the third chapter, the fourth, and part of the fifth (1–4), contain regulations concerning the compensation for damage caused by a goring ox. Following the order of the \"avot nezikin\" given in the beginning of the tractate, the damage caused by a pit is discussed in the second part of the fifth chapter; and the sixth chapter is devoted to the remaining two causes of damage, grazing (1–3) and burning (4–6). Of the last section the following law is noteworthy:\n\nThere are three types of damages caused by a criminal act: (1) by theft (ch. vii.); (2) by violence (ch. viii.); (3) by robbery (ch. ix.–x.).\n\n(1) \"If a man steal an ox or a lamb and slaughter the same or sell it, five cattle shall he pay for the ox and four sheep for the lamb\" (). The regulations as to how to apply this law under various circumstances are contained in chapter vii. 1–6.\n\n(2) The compensation for injuries as the result of violence is discussed in chapter viii. Such compensation includes five items: for the permanent loss (\"\"nezeḳ\"), if any, in earning capacity; loss of time (\"shebet\"); pain (\"ẓa'ar\"); cost of the cure (\"rippuy\"); and insult (\"boshet\"\"). The scale of compensation for an insult, as given in the Mishnah, seems to indicate the maximum compensation, for the Mishnah adds, \"The principle is that the amount depends on the injured man's station in life.\" Rabbi Akiva, however, opposed this principle, and desired to have one measure for all. A practical case decided by Rabbi Akiva is then cited (viii. 7). In addition to all the compensation paid, the offender must beg the injured man's pardon.\n\n(3) He who has robbed his neighbor, and desires to make restitution, pays the full value of the thing taken and a fine of one-fifth of its value. ( [A. V. vi. 2–5]). If the things taken by robbery have undergone a change, he pays according to the value the things had at the time of the robbery (ch. ix.). The last chapter considers cases in which the things taken are no longer in the hands of the robber, and concludes with the warning not to buy things suspected to be stolen. With the exception of chap. vii. 7 (on certain restrictions with regard to the rearing of cattle or poultry in Palestine), there are neither \"halakic\" nor \"haggadic\" digressions in this tractate.\n\nThere are two versions of Bava Kamma: One is within \"Talmud Yerushalmi\", while the other is in \"Talmud Bavli\". The two Gemaras, as usual, discuss the laws of the Mishnah; the Jerusalem Talmud rather briefly, the Babylonian Talmud more fully.\n\nThe following are a few of the principles enunciated in the Gemara: According to Symmachus (Sumkus, not to be confused with Symmachus the Ebionite): Property concerning which there is a doubt whether it belongs to A or to B, is divided between A and B without either being compelled to confirm his claim by oath. The sages (\"chachamim\") hold that he who claims what is in the possession of another, must prove his claim (\"hamotzi machavaro aluv haria\")(B. Ḳ. 46a). A person attacked on his own grounds may take the law into his own hands, when the delay caused by going to a proper court of law would involve great loss. Whenever the whole value of the damaged object is paid, the payment is considered as compensation (\"mamona\"); when only half the value or a certain fixed amount is paid, the payment is considered a fine (\"kenasa\") (B. Ḳ. 15b). The judges in Babylonia had no right to impose a fine for any offense; the case had to be tried by qualified judges in Palestine.\n\nThe following incident will illustrate the last two rules: A man was charged before Rab Ḥisdai (in Babylonia) with having struck a fellow man with his spade. Rab Ḥisdai asked Rab Naḥman how much the offender had to pay. The latter replied that no fine could be imposed in the Babylonian courts, but that he desired to know the facts of the case. He ascertained that A and B had together a well, each of them with the right of drawing water on certain fixed days alone. Contrary to the agreement A drew water on a day that was not his. B noticed it and drove him away with his spade. Rab Naḥman's verdict was that B might with impunity have hit A a hundred times with the spade, as any delay would have involved a great loss to B (B. Ḳ. 27b). It is noteworthy that two codes of law are mentioned: the legal one (\"dine adam,\" literally, judgments of man) and the moral one (\"dine shamayim,\" literally, judgments of heaven). In some cases the former absolves man of an obligation, and the latter does not (Mish. vi. 4; Gem. 29a, 56a, and passim).\n\n\nSome noteworthy explanations of Biblical texts may be added. The words \"ḳa'asher yeba'er hagalal\" (I Kings xiv. 10) are quoted as meaning (Babli 3a; see Rashi, ad loc.) \"as the tooth destroyeth\" (A. V. \"as a man sweepeth the dung\"). \"Erek appayim\" (\"slow to anger,\" Ex. xxxiv. 6) is interpreted \"long-suffering to both the righteous and the wicked\" (ib. 50b), on account of the dual form. A Biblical verse is quoted according to its sense and not literally, as, for example (ib. 81b; compare B. M. 76a), \"mihyot ṭob al tiḳḳare ra'\" (when thou art kind, thou shalt not be called bad); then the question is raised, \"Is it written so?\" and the verse Prov. iii. 27 is cited.\n"}

Since its inception in 2000, more than 1,900 law students have participated in the program. Its main campus is in Scottsdale, Arizona. Notable faculty have included U.S. Court of Appeals Judge Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nBlackstone Legal Fellowship is a highly competitive, nine week intensive summer legal training program which spans June though August. It was founded in 2000 for the purpose of preparing Christian law students for professional legal careers. The first class comprised 24 interns. Since its inception Blackstone has trained more than 1,900 Christian law students. In an interview, ADF co-founder Alan Sears said in 2000 Blackstone was created in response to his observation, \"There’s got to be a better way for law students in America and for young lawyers than we currently have.\" The program is made up of interns, called Fellows, from a diverse selection of law schools as well as elite institutions such as Harvard and Yale. The program is named for Sir William Blackstone, the famed eighteenth century English legal scholar and jurist whose influential commentaries on the common law had a profound impact on the Founding Fathers of the United States.\nIn 2012, Sears was asked about the major achievements of ADF. He said \"among the things I am most thankful for are our Blackstone Legal Fellowship graduates.\"\n\nIn 2017, President Donald Trump's nominee to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, Amy Coney Barrett, was criticized by Senator Al Franken for teaching constitutional law at Blackstone. In her Senate committee hearing he referred to ADF as a \"hate group\". Barrett responded that the hate group label is \"controversial\". Barrett was confirmed to the court by the full Senate.\n\nThe Blackstone Fellowship consists of three phases described as Learn, Lead, and Defend. Fellows spend the first two weeks of the program in the classroom studying in areas such as ethics, theology and jurisprudence. Sessions consist of lectures as well as hands-on interactive presentations.\n\nThe second phase of the program focuses on six-week field placements at a variety of venues across the United States and abroad including \"public-interest law firms, attorneys, law professors, think tanks, and public-policy organizations.\" Placements are selected based on students' aptitude and career goals.\n\nFinally, the Fellows return to ADF in Scottsdale for a week long series of presentations focusing on career development and professional networking. Speakers include legal academics, members of the judiciary, elected representatives, and practicing attorneys. Interns are given an orientation to the Blackstone alumni network.\n\nThe cost of attendance at Blackstone is $6,300. Most Blackstone Fellows receive a scholarship to attend the program. In addition, stipends are available to cover expenses during the placement phase of the program.\n\nThe following is a list of people who are currently or have been affiliated with Blackstone.\n\n"}

It has historically been used in order to define church–state relations and to provide a theoretical basis for the legislative powers of the church in the philosophy of canon law.\n\nIts origins can be traced to the \"Politics\" of Aristotle, who described the \"Polis\" as a whole made of several imperfect parts, i.e. the consummation of natural communities such as the family and the village. The \"perfect community\" was originally developed as a theory of political society. The most sovereign political organization (the Polis) can attain the end of the community as a whole (happiness) better than any of the subordinate parts of the community (family, village, etc.). Since it can attain its end (\"telos\") by its own powers and the resources within itself, then it is self-sufficient. It is self-sufficiency that is the defining element of the polis.\n\nThe idea of \"perfect community\" was also present in medieval philosophy. In direct reference to Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas mentions the state (\"civitas\") as a perfect community (\"communitas perfecta\"):\n\nAquinas never referred to the church as a perfect community in his writings. If Aquinas and medieval writers had any notion of \"communitas perfecta\" being applied to the church, it was not clearly expressed and was not a clear basis for the \"societas perfecta\" theory used in later controversies between church and state.\n\nDuring Enlightenment period, the \"Societas Perfecta\" doctrine was strongly affirmed in order to better protect the church from secular encroachments. It was also mentioned in the magisterium of the Thomistic revivalist pontiffs such as Pius IX. And especially Leo XIII, in his encyclical \"Immortale Dei,\" explains this teaching in relation to the church: \n\nThe two perfect societies correspond to two forces, the church and state: \n\nUntil the Second Vatican Council, the doctrine of the two perfect societies of Leo XIII was held to be official in theological studies. During the council itself, as well as in the new \"1983 Code of Canon Law\" itself, the doctrine was no longer explicitly mentioned and the Aristotelian \"Perfect Community\" was all but replaced by the biblical \"People of God\". In the modern Catholic post-conciliar theology, its discussion is limited to theologians and academics. Its near-abandonment in discourse has proven controversial.\n\nIn any event, Pope Paul VI mentioned it and summarized it in the 1969 \"motu proprio\" \"Sollicitudo omnium ecclesiarum\" on the tasks of the papal legate: \n\nThis theology was largely overshadowed by the biblical theology of the church as the \"mystici corporis Christi\" (mystical body of Christ), which began to be more fully developed in the early 20th century and was affirmed by Pope Pius XII in 1943.\n\n"}

Criminal prosecutions pursuant to federal statutes other than the Criminal Code, such as the \"Controlled Drugs and Substances Act\", the \"Income Tax Act\", and others, are generally (but not exclusively) conducted by the Public Prosecution Service of Canada, which also handles most narcotic case outside of Quebec and New Brunswick. There are similarities between this role and the Procurator Fiscal in Scotland, Crown Prosecutor in England and Wales and United States Attorney or District Attorney in the United States. Crown Attorneys are not elected. They are civil servants and may be removed from their positions pursuant to their employment agreements.\n\nAlthough the enactment of criminal law is under federal jurisdiction in Canada, the prosecution of most Criminal Code offences—outside of the Yukon Territory, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut—is the responsibility of the provincial Attorneys General and their lawful deputies by virtue of the administration of justice powers found in Section 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867 and the \"interpretation\" section of the Criminal Code. As a result, the vast majority of Crown Attorneys are employed by Canada's ten provinces.\n\nLawyers who act on civil or administrative matters for the Provincial Crown are not referred to as Crown Attorneys (Senior General Counsel, General Counsel), or simply Crown Counsel although both criminal and civil attorneys generally report to the provincial Attorney-General's office. Lawyers who work for the Federal Ministry of Justice are often referred to as Crowns even if acting in Civil Matters. Moreover, lawyers, students-at-law and other persons who only represent the Crown on provincial offences matters (such as municipal by-law enforcement and traffic offences) are referred to as \"Provincial Prosecutors\" or \"Provincial Offences Attorneys\" (POAs) rather than Crown Attorneys. Regardless of whether the prosecuted matter is a criminal offence or a provincial offence, Crown Attorneys represent and argue on behalf of the Crown. In the province of Ontario, there is only one \"Crown Attorney\" appointed by the Attorney General per judicial district. The Crown Attorney is charged with supervising the office at the local level, and has a level of autonomy from the Attorney General's office. A Crown Attorney will then, in consultation with the Attorney General's office, hire \"Assistant Crown Attorneys\" to further staff the office and prosecute offences. In this respect, Ontario functions similar to the US system of District Attorneys and Assistant District Attorneys, although within the aspects of the Canadian legal system.\n\nAs Crown Attorneys are not elected, the Canadian prosecutorial system is often seen as less politically motivated than other systems.\n\n\n"}

The plaintiff must still prove all of the same facts that would be the plaintiff's burden, had the action been brought against the insured. In addition, the plaintiff must prove that the insured was covered by the insurance company, and that the insurance policy covered the kind of wrong for which the plaintiff is seeking remedy. The insured is then treated as a third party to the litigation, and the insurance company itself is the defendant.\n\nThis name can also be given to any lawsuit that is brought as a kind of direct action activism. One example can be a customer suing a company to repeal an action deemed an infringement on the rights of the customer as a citizen and thus a subject to federal or state law. \n\nAllegedly, the largest direct-action lawsuit was the subject matter of the motion picture \"Erin Brockovich\".\n"}

Likewise, the rule no longer forms part of Australian law which also uses the \"lex loci delicti\" rule. This rule holds that the applicable law for a tort committed in a foreign place will be the tort law of the foreign place.\n\nIt remains used in New Zealand tort law. Though its continued existence has been called into question, with many suggesting it should be replaced with a rule similar to that of Canada's.\n\nThe rule has largely been abandoned in English law by virtue of section 10 of the Private International Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1995, although defamation claims are specifically excluded (cf. section 13(1)). However, even prior to it being abandoned the courts had increasingly distanced themselves from the rule by applying a \"flexible exception\".

{"id": "14615630", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14615630", "title": "EB-5 visa", "text": "EB-5 visa\n\nThe United States EB-5 visa, \"employment-based fifth preference category\" or \"EB-5 Immigrant Investor Visa Program\", created in 1990 by the Immigration Act of 1990, provides a method for eligible Immigrant Investors to become lawful permanent residents — informally known as \"green card\" holders — by investing at least $1,000,000 to finance a business in the United States that will employ at least 10 American workers.\" Most immigrant investors who use the EB-5 program invest in a targeted employment area (TEA) — a rural area or area with high unemployment — which lowers the investment threshold to $500,000. The EB-5 program is intended to encourage both \"foreign investments and economic growth\". The EB-5 Immigrant Investor Visa Program is one of five employment-based (EB) preference programs in the United States.\n\nApplicants have the choice of investing individually or they can choose to work through a \"larger investor pool via regional centers (RC)\", which are federally approved third-party intermediaries that \"connect foreign investors with developers in need of funding, and take a commission\". Regional centers are usually private, for-profit businesses that are approved by the U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) which is part of the Department of Homeland Security. By May 1, 2017, there were 883 USCIS-approved regional centers and by 2014 the \"vast majority\" of EB-5 visas were \"granted through regional center[s]\". By 2015 the EB-5 program had become an \"important source of capital for developers\" and for the regional centers. If an EB-5 investment is made in a regional center, the jobs may be created indirectly through economic activity, as opposed to a direct investment, where the investment vehicle must directly employ the 10 U.S. workers. \n\nMost investors — about 80 percent — come from four countries: China, South Korea, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. Others have come from Canada, India, Mexico, Iran, and Japan. In 2014 85% of the 10,692 EB-5 visas issued were for Chinese nationals according to a study by Savills Studley, a \"real estate services firm\". On May 5, 2017, President Trump approved a renewal of the EB-5 Visa program as part of the first major piece of legislation of his administration, Bill H.R.244, which extended the spending bill—and Immigrant Investor Visa Program—through September 30, 2017.\n\nThe EB-5 visa provides a method of obtaining a green card for foreign nationals who invest in a \"new commercial enterprise\" in the United States. The EB-5 program \"affords foreign nationals and their spouses and unmarried children under age 21 the ability to obtain a U.S. visa based solely upon a minimum investment in a for-profit enterprise that creates or retains a specified number of jobs\". To obtain the visa, individuals must invest $1,000,000 (or at least $500,000 in a Targeted Employment Area - high unemployment or rural area), creating or preserving at least 10 jobs for U.S. workers excluding the investor and their immediate family.\n\nIf the foreign national investor's petition is approved, the investor and their dependents will be granted conditional permanent residence valid for two years. Within the 90-day period before the conditional permanent residence expires, the investor must submit evidence documenting that the full required investment has been made and that 10 jobs have been maintained, or 10 jobs have been created or will be created within a reasonable time period.\n\nCommercial real estate projects result in job creation through construction work at first and eventually in the service industry, for example in hotels, restaurants, resorts and/or stadium development. For that reason, many of the EB-5 visa investments \"target commercial real estate\".\n\nHotel and multi-use developments financed with EB-5 investments include Hilton, Hyatt Hotels, Marriott's, Starwood's SLS Hotel & Casino.\n\nIn 2016 \"Forbes\" cited Hudson Yards, Manhattan as a \"fine example\" of one of the \"very successful projects\" resulting from EB-5 investments.\n\nIn southern California, EB-5 projects include Europa Village, in Temecula, the Hilton Garden Inn in El Monte, and the JW Marriott hotel at L.A. Live in downtown Los Angeles.\n\nCongress created the employment-based fifth preference category (EB-5) visa program in 1990 to \"create jobs for U.S. workers and to infuse new capital into the U.S. economy\". At that time the program was directed towards \"alien entrepreneurs\" who would not only invest $1 million or $500,000 in a \"new commercial enterprise\" but would also \"engage in the management of the new enterprise\" creating ten full-time jobs for U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. In order to make the program more investor-friendly, Congress enacted the 1993 Appropriations Act which amended the EB-5 program to create the \"Pilot Immigration Program\" — the Immigrant Investor Pilot Program (IIPP). Under the IIPP, foreign nationals could invest in a pre-approved regional center, or \"economic unit [referred to as regional centers], public or private, which is involved with the promotion of economic growth, including increased export sales, improved regional productivity, job creation, or increased domestic capital investment\". Investments within a regional center provide foreign nationals the added benefit of allowing them to count jobs created both directly and indirectly for purposes of meeting 10-job creation requirement. This was intended to help potential investors to meet \"the program's stringent requirements\" through passive investment. With the IIPP, the EB-5 visa became an investor's visa as opposed to an entrepreneur's visa.\n\nIn c.1995 former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) officials formed a company called AIS that acted as intermediaries between INS and immigrant entrepreneurs in the EB-5 program. Whereas EB-5 required an investment of $500,000 AIS only required $125,000 cash with the rest — $375,000 in the form of a promissory note. AIS claimed the promissory note would \"be forgiven once the immigrant's permanent residency application was approved\". The U.S. immigration agency, which was then known as the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), had interpreted the regulations regarding financial qualifications in a way that accepted this arrangement until c. 1998 when they were under investigation by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). There were allegations that the INS was giving preferential treatment to AIS in EB-5 matters. The INS (now USCIS) changed their \"interpretation of regulations regarding financial qualifications\" as a result of the probe. In 1997 and 1998 two owner-operators of Interbank, Herndon, Virginia had \"filed 320 false [EB-5] applications on behalf of 270 EB-5 immigrant investors. The INS raided Interbank in August 1998. The EB-5 program was temporarily suspended. Although no one in AIS or INS were charged, in 2000 the two Interbank operators were arrested, then convicted and imprisoned on dozens of counts of \"money-laundering and fraud\" in the largest case of EB-5 fraud. INS District Director Warren A. Lewis said, \"Visa fraud whether done on the streets by selling fraudulent cards or through an elaborate financial scheme is against the law and will be investigated and prosecuted.\" Hundreds of the immigrant investors \"lured\" to the United States had their permanent residency applications denied. Because of the INS investigation, the processing of 900 EB-5 cases was suspended, leaving immigrant families in limbo for years. When the GAO tabled their report in 2005 they concluded that immigrant investors were not utilizing the program because of the 900 EB-5 suspended files—some of which dated to 1995—as well as the \"onerous application process\" and \"lengthy adjudication periods\".\n\nAccording to a Brookings Institution and Rockefeller Foundation 2014 report, starting in 2008 there was a renewed interest in the \"under-utilized\" EB-5 visa program as the number of \"wealthy investors\" and \"ultra-wealthy individuals\" in emerging markets abroad increased and the access to \"traditional domestic financing\" in the United States had decreased because of the Great Recession.\n\nBy 2010, foreign investors' use of the EB-5 program was far less than Congress had originally anticipated. In 2011, USCIS began making a number of changes to the program in hopes of increasing the number of applicants. By the end of the 2011 fiscal year, more than 3,800 EB-5 applications had been filed, compared to fewer than 800 applications in 2007.\n\nInitially, under the first EB-5 program, the foreign investor was required to create an entirely new commercial enterprise; however, under the Pilot Program investments can be made directly in a job-generating commercial enterprise (new, or existing - \"Troubled Business\"), or into a regional center - a 3rd party-managed investment vehicle (private or public), which assumes the responsibility of creating the requisite jobs. Regional centers may charge an administration fee for managing the investor's investment and a \"percentage of what they raise from the developers\" which amounts to millions on large projects.\n\nThe program reached capacity for the first time in August 2014 when the State Department stopped issuing EB-5 visas until the beginning of the next fiscal year, October 2014. By 2014, the number of EB-5 visas granted had more than doubled since 2009.\n\nAccording to the Savills Studley 2015 report, in 2011 out of a total of 3,463 EB-5 Visas granted, 2,408 of them — representing 69.5% — were from Chinese nationals. By 2014 out of a total of 10,692 EB-5 Visas granted, 9,128 of them — representing 85.4% — were from Chinese nationals. The authors of the report conclude that the \"increase in the number of applicants to the EB-5 program has stemmed from an increase in interest from mainland Chinese\". As China's economy flourished, there was an increase in the number of millionaire families in China. In 2012 there were 1.5 million, by 2013 there were 2.4 million which is more than the number of millionaire families in Japan.\n\nThe original EB-5 law required investment in a Targeted Employment Area. This meant that the area for potential investment had to be either rural or have a \"jobless rate\" representing \"150% of the national average\". However, over time regions and states that wanted both the development and the employment, and developers became more skilled in \"crafting\" an acceptable targeted area (TEA)s, an \"essential part of gaining USCIS approval\". A June 2014 \"Fortune\" article claimed that, \"after years of industry pressure, it's now USCIS policy to automatically accept any state designation of a TEA, even though states routinely approve gerrymandered districts that tack on distant high-unemployment tracts to allow EB-5 endeavors in wealthy areas\".\n\nBy 2011 there were concerns raised about areas in New York that had been \"strangely gerrymandered\" in order that \"relatively upscale and wealthy locations could qualify for TEA status\" according to an article in \"The New York Times\" in 2011. A proposed China City program in that area received \"pushback from locals against an EB-5-funded program\" there.\n\nMarriott EB-5-funded construction projects have been criticized for acquiring TEA status for wealthy and well-off regions including in Washington D.C., contradicting the original spirit of the TEA designation. In June 2014 when the $520 million-Marriott Marquis convention center hotel—D.C.'s new largest hotel—was officially opened on June 10, 2014 by Mayor Vince Gray, who announced Air China's maiden first direct flights between D.C. and Beijing. and hoped the Air China passengers would \"stay in the Marriott Marquis\". In a June 27 article \"Washington City Paper\" reported that it was \"fitting\" that Air China passengers stayed in the Marriott Marquis because they invested $5 million through the federal EB-5 visa program \"earning green cards in the process\". In the same article, other recent \"major D.C. development projects using EB-5 funds\" including Shaw's CityMarket at O development that \"used $97 million of EB-5 funding\" and earned \"green cards for nearly 200 foreigners\". A top priority of Mayor Gray's administration was to nurture a \"stronger business relationship with China, the primary source of EB-5 funding in D.C. and nationally\".\n\nBy 2014 the process by which an area could qualify for TEA status had eased considerably as reflected in the simplified description of the qualifying requirements published by the American Immigration Lawyers Association, \"Each immigrant investor must create 10 US jobs with an investment of $500,000 or more\".\n\nIf the location of the proposed new business is not a TEA, the investor has the option to gather the relevant publicly available state or federal statistics on their own and submit it with their petition for USCIS to have a new TEA determination made. In California, the investor may petition the state government for designating a particular subdivision of the area as an area of high unemployment (over 150% the national average); however, this designation is not made by USCIS.\n\nThere is no centralized list of targeted employment areas. California, Florida, and Washington maintain lists of TEAs. The Washington State Employment Security Department designates which areas have high unemployment rates (HUAS) that qualify for EB-5 visa.\n\nImmigration restrictionists, such as Tea Party supporters, were critical of expansive definitions of targeted employment areas.\n\n\"The EB-5 Regional Center Program creates jobs and spurs capital investment in communities across the nation.\"\n\nThe 1993 Appropriations Act amended the EB-5 program to create the Immigrant Investor Pilot Program (IIPP), which allowed foreign nationals to invest in an economic unit called a regional center, or \"economic unit\" [referred to as regional centers]. RCs promote economic growth, \"including increased export sales, improved regional productivity, job creation, or increased domestic capital investment\". Private entities or states can apply to become regional centers. Investments within a regional center provide foreign nationals the added benefit of allowing them to count jobs created both directly and indirectly for purposes of meeting the 10-job creation requirement. The EB-5 Regional Center Pilot Program (RC) program, which was \"enacted in 1993 for a period of five years\", allows investors to \"pool their investments into a larger project assembled by a regional center, for which indirect jobs may be counted\". The five-year pilot program has been regularly reauthorized ever since. USCIS maintains a list of approved (but not necessarily endorsed or guaranteed) EB-5 regional centers by state, but without specific details.\n\nRCs are USCIS-approved third-party entities, usually for-profit, private intermediaries, that \"connect foreign investors with developers in need of funding, and take a commission\". The RC approvals are decided by the U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) which is part of the Department of Homeland Security. By May 1, 2017 the USCIS 883 RCs were USCIS-approved. The USCIS — the agency that administers the program, the regional centers and the immigrant investor form the three prongs of the regional center program interaction. The Brookings-Rockefeller report included the program's \"missteps\" that \"illustrate the vulnerability of a system dependent on the relationships between USCIS, regional centers, and investors\".\n\nIn 1994 the first two regional centers were established and by 2007 there were sixteen. As the banking crisis worsened and access to capital became difficult, the number of approved regional centers proliferated. At the end of FY 2007 there were only 11 USCIS-approved regional centers. In 2008 the RCs \"nearly doubled\" and their numbers mushroomed since then. By February 2, 2015, there were approximately 630 and by May 1, 2017, there were 883. Many of them operate in multiple states.\n\nBy 2015 the RC program had \"generated billions of dollars in capital investment and created tens of thousands of jobs across the country\". By 2015, RC applications represented over 95% of all EB-5 investments. EB-5 investors who use RC intermediaries are \"free of the day-today active management of a business\". but they lose on the rate of return. The Savills Studley 2015 report recommended that investors who are concerned about maximizing profits benefit from investing individually.\n\nIn June 2015 Senators Patrick Leahy (D-Vt) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) introduced legislation to \"extend and significantly improve the job-creating immigrant investor visa program\" and re-authorize the \"EB-5 Regional Center program\". Senator Leahy said that, since 2005, the EB-5 program had \"create[d] jobs and provide[d] access to capital in communities in Vermont and throughout the country, all at no cost to American taxpayers\". Senator Grassley added, \"The EB-5 regional center program was created to benefit American communities through investment and job creation. In many instances the program has helped combat a stagnant economy.\"\n\nEB-5 Funding has helped rebuild the Las Vegas economy. Las Vegas has seen a recent boom in using regional centers and EB-5 funding to build new casino projects. In 2013 the first EB-5 project the Downtown Grand was built followed by SLS formerly the Sahara Hotel. Additional new casino projects obtaining EB-5 funding on the Las Vegas Strip include the Lucky Dragon Hotel and Casino, Dynasty Hotel Casino, Clarion Hotel, and Resorts World Las Vegas. Foreign investors are also being solicited to invest in Las Vegas' SLS Hotel & Casino.\n\nMajor developers formed their own regional centers with the goal of soliciting EB-5 investments. Silverstein Properties, for example, has marketed their Downtown Manhattan The Four Seasons Restaurant as an \"EB-5 investment opportunity\" on their website. Other projects that have received EB-5 regional center funding include the Hudson Yards Redevelopment Project, the George Washington Bridge Bus Terminal, and the New York Wheel.\n\nNicholas Mastroianni II is the Founder, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of U.S. Immigration Fund, LLC and its affiliated companies (USIF), including multiple EB-‐5 approved regional centers in New York, New Jersey and Florida (and California pending).\n\nIn 2010 Nicholas Mastroianni, II opened the first of his three EB-5 process regional centers. The three are now under the parent company, the U.S. Immigration Fund. As owner-operator of the Florida Regional Center, he sought investors the \"$144-million mixed-use project\" called Harbourside Place, in Jupiter, north of Palm Beach. According to his website, his company is involved in development projects worth $14.75 billion \"funded with $3 billion in EB-5 money\" resulting in the creation of 81,000 jobs. Projects funded by EB-5 visa program with Mastrioni's U.S. Immigration Fund hired to seek investors include HFZ Capital's 76 11th Avenue luxury residential building. \nIn 2017, USIF began its partnership with the Chopras Group, the leading education firm in India, to expand the EB-5 Visa program to potential Indian Investors. In 2018, Nick Mastroianni II explained to The Real Deal that he thinks 2018 will hold changes that have long been coming to the EB-5 Visa Program.\n\nIn 2008 David Morris, an entrepreneurial immigration lawyer with Visa Law Group and Angel Brunner, an economist and urban planner—formerly of the D.C.'s Neighborhood Development Company and the National Capital Revitalization Corporation—co-founded the DC Regional Center when they partnered on \"their first big project, CityMarket at O\". By 2014, Morris and Brunner dominated EB-5 projects in D.C. Brunner and Morris introduced EB-5 initiatives to the D.C. District government office administrator Adrian Fenty. Working through the DC Regional Center but separately, Morris and Brunner were the intermediaries for a number of major D.C.'s EB-5-funded development projects. Morris raised $65 million for the Hyatt Place hotel, $55 million in EB-5 funding for Skyland Town Center, representing \"110 green cards for foreign investors\". Brunner \"brought more than $80 million in EB-5 capital to D.C.\" including a Hilton hotel project \"with $39 million in EB-5 investments\", and a large residential development near the Navy Yard.\n\nUSIF said the firm was \"committed to strict adherence to securities and all applicable laws,\"\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) considers some \"EB-5 offerings\" to be securities covered under U.S. securities laws. \"[C]ompanies and individuals that sell EB-5 investments cannot \"defraud investors, make false claims or fail to mention relevant information\". However, the SEC has limited ability to \"bring fraud claims where the funds solicited and the investors are based overseas\".\n\nThe U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) sets guidelines for EB-5 projects and monitors compliance with immigration rules. Under EB-5 visa guidelines, \"investors must put their capital at risk and the green card is not guaranteed\". The USCIS also evaluates approvals for regional centers.\n\nIn 2013, the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued an investor alert to warn investors about an increase in fraudulent investment scams that exploit the EB-5 visa program. The SEC listed \"warning signs of fraud\" such as automatic, timely and/or guaranteed \"[p]romises of a visa or permanent resident status\" and established the SEC Whistleblower Program to offer a monetary award for \"exposing EB-5 fraud\". Under the SEC Whistleblower Program, individuals are eligible to receive a reward for providing the SEC with original information about securities fraud, including EB-5 fraud. If the SEC uses the individual's information to bring a successful enforcement action, he or she is eligible to receive 10% to 30% of the monetary sanctions collected as an award. A whistleblower's tip about a $147 million EB-5 scheme has already resulted in a $14.7 million SEC award. Since this SEC alert and inception of the SEC Whistleblower Program, the SEC has enforced actions against individuals and companies responsible for nearly $1 billion worth of fraudulent EB-5 projects.\n\nFor a twelve-month period in 2015 and 2016, the SEC successfully brought \"enforcement actions against nearly $1 billion worth of EB-5 projects\"—a majority of them against \"individuals or companies that misuse investors' funds\". On August 24, 2015 the SEC filed civil fraud charges against Lobsang Dargey for his misuse of the EB-5 Visa program by misappropriating about $136 million from Chinese investors through his Path America entity. The SEC received a settlement offer in January 2017 that \"signaled \"a possible resolution to the high-profile case\".\n\nBy 2016 scrutiny of the EB-5 program had increased as \"investigators uncovered numerous cases of fraud, discovered individuals with possible ties to Chinese and Iranian intelligence using fake documents and learned that international fugitives who have laundered money had infiltrated the program.\" In that year Senator Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), a longtime critic of EB-5, described the program as one that had \"long been riddled with corruption and national security vulnerabilities.\n\nIn March 2016 Taylor Johnson, a special agent with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who had questioned the \"vetting of individuals involved in a [EB-5] development project in Las Vegas\" was fired. In response to her complaints, the Office of Special Counsel and the Department of Homeland Security's Office of the Inspector General undertook an investigation.\n\nVermont's EB-5 program was \"burned\" with the \"massive eight-year fraudulent scheme\" in which the owners of Jay Peak Ski Resort in Vermont misappropriated funds for a $350 million EB-5 project. It was the \"most followed EB-5 fraud case\" according to \"Forbes\". Foreign investors lost their investments in \"Jay Peak, Burke Mountain and related projects in the NEK\".\n\nIn June 2015 Senators Patrick Leahy (D-Vt) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) introduced the \"American Job Creation and Investment Promotion Reform Act\" to \"extend and significantly improve the job-creating immigrant investor visa program\" and to \"address fraud and national security concerns\". In September 2016, House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) and Ranking Member John Conyers (D-MI) introduced legislation to \"reform and reauthorize the EB-5 Regional Center program\".\n\nIn February 2017 Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Grassley, a critic of EB-5, introduced a bill in February 2017 to terminate the program. In a joint statement they claimed that, \"The EB-5 program is inherently flawed. It says that U.S. citizenship is for sale. It is wrong to have a special pathway to citizenship for the wealthy while millions wait in line for visas.\" Grassley and Feinstein say that \"there is no reliable or verifiable way to measure how many jobs are created\" and that \"many of the wealthiest parts of the country have been incorrectly labeled as \"high unemployment.\"\n\nIn April 2017 the EB-5 visa \"cash-for-residency scheme\" was under investigation by the FBI with a specific focus on the California Investment Immigration Fund because of its \"alleg[ed] connection[s] to \"abuses of the \"controversial\" program. The FBI raided a Los Angeles-area business in April, 2017 in which a father and daughter team were suspected of \"orchestrating a $50 million\" EB-5 visa fraud scheme.\n\nSupporters of the foreign investor visa include Senator Chuck Schumer (D-New York), along with some in the Obama administration. They say that the program \"delivered billions of dollars into the American economy: $8.7 billion and 35,140 jobs since October 12\". According to federal auditors the numbers were \"not valid and reliable\".\n\nThey \"have capitalized on a lucrative government program that critics say has little oversight and loose rules\".\n\nStarting on May 6, 2017, a number of major media outlets began raising concerns about ethical implications regarding the way in which the EB-5 program was promoted to potential Chinese investors by Kushner Companies in May 2017, considering Jared Kushner's pivotal and influential role in the Presidency of Donald Trump, his father-in-law. Chinese investors were shown a photo of Donald Trump in the marketing slide show to suggest the ease of getting a green card. \"The Independent\" headlined with \"Trump and Kushner exploitation of presidency 'unlike anything we have ever seen before'.\n\nA 2015 study found that the EB-5 investor visa program boosted investment in the United States during the Great Recession of 2008 to 2012. The study found \"that Chinese wealthy private business owners are mainly participants in EB-5 for acquiring a U.S. green card on behalf of their young adult children. The rate of return of the EB-5 program for investors is a low-priority item, less important than return of capital.\"\n\n"}

The service is submissive and was included into the structure of the Ministry of Health Care of Russia till 2012. This service was founded in 2004. Since May 2012 Rospotrebnadzor was excluded from the Ministry of Health and reports directly to the Russian Government. It functions on the base of the Act of Federal Service on the base of the Administrative Regulation.\n\nOrganization's history goes back to the Decree of the Council of People's Commissars of the RSFSR \"On the sanitary authorities of the Republic\" dated 15 September 1922.\nUp to 2004 in Russia in 2218 functioned sanitary-epidemiological stations (centers).\nThe current structure of the organization founded by the decree of the President of Russia on March 9, 2004 № 314 \"On the system and structure of federal bodies of executive power\". Subordinated to the Ministry of Health. In accordance with the presidential decree of May 21, 2012 № 636 \"On the system and structure of federal executive bodies\" under the direct authority of the Government of Russia. Since the establishment of the Federal Service (2004) is led by GG Onishchenko. \nAll the organs and institutions of the Federal Service currently employs approximately 110,000 professionals.\n\nRospotrebnadzor in the plan of regulating of the state functions connected with the technical regulation, evaluation of conformity or other kinds of state regulating performs the following functions:\n\n\nEven listing the kinds of activities of Rospotrebnadzor, connected with drawing up different kinds of permissive documents makes a significant list. Let’s give more details about some certain directions while receiving permissive documents.\n\nPermissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor are issued in the form of Permit for exploitation of buildings and premises. This document testifies about the fact that the premises conforms to the requirements to performing a certain kind of activity and providing some kind of service. This document is obligatory for receiving for owners of restaurants and cafes, food shops and swimming pools, children's preschool, school institutions, medical cabinets and clinics, by providing hair-dresser, laundry and other similar institutions.\n\nThe function of permissive document is brought by negotiation of the Program of Industrial Control of an object of any legal entity or an individual entrepreneur that applied to Rospotrebnadzor in order to draw up a sanitary conclusion or permit for exploitation or in other cases. This Program appears to be the plan of sanitary measurements of an organization or institutions that allow meet all the requirements of the Russian sanitary legislation.\n\nIt is clear that such kind of permissive documents is called a license, that is drawn up after performing an analysis of the documents presented before the body of licensing, that prove performing all the requirements of licensing set for the certain kind of activities.\n\nRospotrebnadzor is authorized to draw up permissive documents for the following directions of licensed kinds of entrepreneurship:\n\n\nIssuing different kinds of documents is performed both by territorial bodies of Rospotrebnadzor and its central apparatus depending on the class of danger of apparatus of ionizing radiation and the class of danger of provocatives of infection diseases. Drawing up permissive documents is primarily required for meeting requirements of the Federal Law “About Sanitary Well Being of the population of the RF”.\n\nThe kind of drawn up permissive documents primarily depends on the object suffering evaluation of conformity. So, for many kinds of production it was required to draw up the sanitary-epidemiologic conclusion. The SEC, this was the widely known name of thus famous document. But from 1 July 2012 issuing of these permissive documents was stopped. They were replaced by the Certificate of State Registration of the Customs Union and the Expert Conclusion.\n\nThe Expert Conclusion is not the direct analog of the SEC. Earlier, until 1 July 2010, the mandatory sanitary-epidemiologic conclusion (SEC) or hygienic certificate for realization both Russian and foreign goods were required for the most part of production on the Russian market. All the children’s goods, all the production that we eat, drink or wear, or all that we use in our everyday life underwent the mandatory evaluation of conformity to SNiPs or SanPins. After the moment that the legislation of the Customs Union went into force, for some groups of goods that may do the most significant harm with their unquality, it became necessary to prove the conformity with the help of the unified requirements of the CU by means of drawing up of the Certificate of State Registration of the CU.\n\nIn the same document, that states the list of such production (Decision of the CU Commission 299 of 28 May 2010) in the first part there is a list of the goods for which by crossing the border of the RF (CU) there can be the necessity of sanitary-epidemiologic control. In this case for this kind of production we’ll need the hygienic certificate – the Expert Conclusion of the Rospotrebnadzor.\n\nThe Expert Conclusion of the Rospotrebnadzor unlike the SEC appears to be the voluntary document. As the situation of the sanitary control may occur or may not occur. The reason why the customs services may require sanitary documents and going through hygienic control of the load may be as follows:\n\nInjured cartridge, conveyor or other kind of package in which transportation of the load is performed;\nMismatch between documents and loads detected;\nThere is information about breaking that is connected with given delivery, about mismatch between the documents and the contents of the transport units and in some other cases.\n\nThe permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor are mandatory to draw up for the production included into the List of the goods to go through sanitary control by crossing the border of the CU, that was approved by the Commission of the CU on 18 July 2010.\n\nIf the production is included into the first part of this document, so the kind of the permissive document of the Rospotrebnadzor is the Expert Conclusion. If the production is included into the second part of the document, so the kind of the document of Rospotrebnadzor is the Certificate of State Registration of the CU.\n\nThe both documents are possible to be received only on the base of the Expert Conclusion after the performed certification tests, done by the certification laboratory (having authorization of the CU). They prove that the studied product meets the Unified sanitary requirements of the three countries the Union members.\n\nSuch documents must be received also for these kinds of Russian production if they are firstly manufactured for realization on the market of the Customs Union.\n\nThe volume of the production items for which it is required the following permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor is reduced nearly ten times in comparison with the list of goods for which it is necessary to draw up the SEC and (or) the Certificate of State Registration of the RF.\n\nIn the cases that the production went through the sanitary supervision on the base of the Russian Sanitary Rules and in the present it needs drawing up the sanitary permissive document of the Rospotrebnadzor in accordance with the requirements of the legislation of the CU, bet nevertheless the customs inspection requires the document of proof, but also it is necessary to apply to Rospotrebnadzor.\n\nIn such situations you will receive the drawn up the Exemption Letter of Rospotrebnadzor. But the information, which it usually comprises, is of the general legislative character (it can be read in the laws of the CU). That is why the consultants recommend draw up the Expert Conclusion of Rospotrebnadzor in such cases.\n\nThe permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor were issued till the end of 2012 for the production that in accordance with the national legislation required its inclusion into the State Registry before its start of realization on the territory of the RF.\n\nThe permissive documents of Rospotrebnadzor drawn up on the blank of the Certificate of State Registration of the RF will be valid on the territory of Russia till the end of the year.\n\nSuch a document is drawn up from 1 July 2010 and is called the Certificate of State Registration of the CU. On which it is required to draw up the given permissive documents. The above-mentioned article describes it.\n\nAs the Certificate of State Registration of the CU replaced two earlier existing Russian documents proving the sanitary safety of production and duplicating each other. Earlier entrepreneurs had to go through the same procedure of proving conformity of production to sanitary requirements of the Russian legislation twice. The Certificate of the CU replaced the Sanitary-Epidemiologic Conclusion and the Certificate of State Registration of the RF.\n\n"}

Often it is understood to include only downside risk, meaning the potential for financial loss and uncertainty about its extent.\n\nA science has evolved around managing market and financial risk under the general title of modern portfolio theory initiated by Dr. Harry Markowitz in 1952 with his article, \"Portfolio Selection\". In modern portfolio theory, the variance (or standard deviation) of a portfolio is used as the definition of risk.\n\nAsset-backed risk is the risk that changes in one or more assets that support an asset-backed security will significantly impact the value of the supported security. Risks include interest rate, term modification, and prepayment risk.\n\nCredit risk, also called \"default risk\", is the risk associated with a borrower going into default (not making payments as promised). Investor losses include lost principal and interest, decreased cash flow, and increased collection costs. An investor can also assume credit risk through direct or indirect use of leverage. For example, an investor may purchase an investment using margin. Or an investment may directly or indirectly use or rely on repo, forward commitment, or derivative instruments.\n\nForeign investment risk is the risk of rapid and extreme changes in value due to: smaller markets; differing accounting, reporting, or auditing standards; nationalization, expropriation or confiscatory taxation; economic conflict; or political or diplomatic changes. Valuation, liquidity, and regulatory issues may also add to foreign investment risk.\n\nThis is the risk that a given security or asset cannot be traded quickly enough in the market to prevent a loss (or make the required profit). There are two types of liquidity risk:\n\nThe four standard market risk factors are equity risk, interest rate risk, currency risk, and commodity risk:\n\nOperational risk means the risk that a company or individual has to face due their own operation and decisions made for the investment\n\n\nFinancial risk, market risk, and even inflation risk can at least partially be moderated by forms of diversification.\n\nThe returns from different assets are highly unlikely to be perfectly correlated and the correlation may sometimes be negative. For instance, an increase in the price of oil will often favour a company that produces it, but negatively impact the business of a firm such an airline whose variable costs are heavily based upon fuel.\nHowever, share prices are driven by many factors, such as the general health of the economy which will increase the correlation and reduce the benefit of diversification.\nIf one constructs a portfolio by including a wide variety of equities, it will tend to exhibit the same risk and return characteristics as the market as a whole, which many investors see as an attractive prospect, so that index funds have been developed that invest in equities in proportion to the weighting they have in some well-known index such as the FTSE.\n\nHowever, history shows that even over substantial periods of time there is a wide range of returns that an index fund may experience; so an index fund by itself is not \"fully diversified\". Greater diversification can be obtained by diversifying across asset classes; for instance a portfolio of many bonds and many equities can be constructed in order to further narrow the dispersion of possible portfolio outcomes.\n\nA key issue in diversification is the correlation between assets, the benefits increasing with lower correlation. However this is not an observable quantity, since the future return on any asset can never be known with complete certainty. This was a serious issue in the late-2000s recession when assets that had previously had small or even negative correlations suddenly starting moving in the same direction causing severe financial stress to market participants who had believed that their diversification would protect them against any plausible market conditions, including funds that had been explicitly set up to avoid being affected in this way.\n\nDiversification has costs. Correlations must be identified and understood, and since they are not constant it may be necessary to rebalance the portfolio which incurs transaction costs due to buying and selling assets. \nThere is also the risk that as an investor or fund manager diversifies, their ability to monitor and understand the assets may decline leading to the possibility of losses due to poor decisions or unforeseen correlations.\n\nHedging is a method for reducing risk where a combination of assets are selected to offset the movements of each other.\nFor instance, when investing in a stock it is possible to buy an option to sell that stock at a defined price at some point in the future. The combined portfolio of stock and option is now much less likely to move below a given value. As in diversification there is a cost, this time in buying the option for which there is a premium. Derivatives are used extensively to mitigate many types of risk.\n\nACPM - Active credit portfolio management\n\nEAD - Exposure at default\n\nEL - Expected loss\n\nLGD - Loss given default\n\nPD - Probability of default\n\nKMV - quantitative credit analysis solution developed by credit rating agency Moody's\n\nVaR - Value at Risk, a common methodology for measuring risk due to market movements\n\n\n"}

One of its components, Moby Thesaurus, has more than 2.5 million synonyms and related words, making it the largest thesaurus in the English language as of early 2006. Previously, Ward was known for compiling and distributing a public domain version of the complete works of William Shakespeare, \"Moby Shakespeare\", which has been credited as being the most widely distributed works of Shakespeare in the world.\n\nIn 1993, his publisher, the Austin Code Works, was investigated for the export of strong cryptography; the US government at the time treated cryptographic software above a certain strength as the legal equivalent of munitions and restricted them accordingly. Ward spent time developing source code fragments collectively called Moby Crypto to encourage the pervasive development of programs containing state-of-the-art cryptography. Ward also promoted the idea of creating secure, memorable pass-phrases through \"shocking nonsense.\" On 30 March 1995 he aided in the distribution of an NSA employee handbook when it was leaked by the on-line magazine \"Phrack\" arguing that, if the government could not keep safe its own materials, then there was no reason for anyone to trust them to maintain a secure key escrow scheme the NSA had proposed.\n\nIn 1996 the Church of Scientology sued Ward, alleging that he was responsible for anonymous postings of material to which the Church claimed copyright. After several years of litigation in which Ward defended \"pro per\" \"in forma pauperis\" and responded to more than 1000 docket items in the Northern District of California, San Jose, the lawsuit was eventually settled on 12 May 1998. Ward prevailed on the Church's trade secret claim resulting in a dismissal with prejudice, but agreed to a stipulated judgement on Scientology's copyright claim. Without a finding of liability by Ward, he agreed to pay Scientology $200 a month for life. Unusually for legal settlements with the Church of Scientology, the settlement was not secret, and contained no restrictions on what Ward could say about Scientology. The settlement itself became a source of ongoing legal dispute with two appeals to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, but to date it has not been violated by either party.\n\nOn February 16, 2012, Grady Ward published a novel, \"The Celestial Instructi0n\", detailing a fictional attack on the United States information infrastructure. In 2012, his niece, K. E. Ward, also an author, published a novel, \"The Heart Grows Stronger\".\n\n\n"}

Instead, if the shares are held for 1 year from the date of exercise and 2 years from the date of grant, then the profit (if any) made on sale of the shares is taxed as long-term capital gain. Long-term capital gain is taxed in the U.S. at lower rates than ordinary income.\nAlthough ISOs have more favorable tax treatment than non-ISOs (a.k.a. non-statutory stock option (NSO) or non-qualified stock option (NQO or NQSO)), they also require the holder to take on more risk by having to hold onto the stock for a longer period of time if the holder is to receive optimal tax treatment. However, even if the holder disposes of the stock within a year, it is possible that there will still be marginal tax deferral value (as compared to NQOs) if the holding period, though less than a year, straddles the ending of the taxpayer's taxable reporting period.\n\nNote further that an employer generally does not claim a corporate income tax deduction (which would be in an amount equal to the amount of income recognized by the employee) upon the exercise of its employee's ISO, unless the employee does not meet the holding-period requirements. \"But see\" Coughlan, Section 174 R&E Deduction Upon Statutory Stock Option Exercise, 58 Tax Law. 435 (2005).

Existing from at least 1344, the Inns gradually changed their purpose, and became both the offices and accommodation for solicitors (as the Inns of Court were to barristers) and a place of initial training for barristers.\n\nThe practice of training barristers at the Inns of Chancery had died out by 1642, and the Inns instead became dedicated associations and offices for solicitors. With the founding of the Society of Gentlemen Practisers in 1739 and the Law Society of England and Wales in 1825, a single unified professional association for solicitors, the purpose of the Inns died out, and after a long period of decline the last one (Clement's Inn) was sold in 1903 and demolished in 1934.\n\nThe Inns of Chancery evolved in tandem with the Inns of Court. During the 12th and early 13th centuries the law was taught in the City of London, primarily by the clergy. But during the 13th century an event occurred which ended legal education by the Church. A papal bull in 1218 prohibited the clergy from practising in the secular, common law courts. As a result, law began to be practised and taught by laymen instead of by clerics. To protect their schools from competition, Henry II and Henry III issued proclamations prohibiting the teaching of the civil law within the City of London. These schools were based in hostels or \"inns\", which later took their name from the landlord of the inn in question.\nThe Inns of Chancery sprung up around the Inns of Court, and took their name and original purpose from the chancery clerks, who used the buildings as hostels and offices where they would draft their writs. As with the Inns of Court the precise dates of founding of the Inns of Chancery are unknown, but the one commonly said to be the oldest is Clifford's Inn, which existed from at least 1344. Thavie's Inn, founded in 1349, is considered to be the next oldest, and several legal historians mistakenly considered it the oldest of them all.\n\nFor several centuries, education at one of the Inns of Chancery was the first step towards becoming a barrister. A student would first join one of the Inns of Chancery, where he would be taught in the form of moots and rote learning. He would also be taught by Readers sent from the Inn of Court that his Inn of Chancery was attached to, who would preside over the moots and discuss cases with the students. At the end of each legal term, particularly promising students would be transferred to the parent Inn of Court and begin the next stage of their education. By 1461 there were approximately 100 students studying at the Inns of Chancery at any one time.\n\nAt the same time, the Inns of Chancery was used as accommodation and offices by solicitors, the other branch of the English legal profession. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the purpose of the Inns changed. After the outbreak of the First English Civil War in 1642, the practice of teaching barristers in the Inns ceased, and as a result the Inns of Chancery became a dedicated association for solicitors instead, offering offices and accommodation. The foundation of the Society of Gentlemen Practisers and Law Society of England and Wales in 1739 and 1825 respectively as professional bodies for the solicitors profession relegated the Inns of Chancery to little more than eccentric dining clubs, and they were gradually dissolved and sold. In 1897 a popular book reported that nobody could remember the purpose of the buildings and that an 1850 investigation had failed to uncover their origins. The last Inn to be sold was Clement's Inn, which was sold in 1903, and demolished in 1934.\n\nJohn Fortescue wrote of ten Inns of Chancery, each one attached to an Inn of Court \"like Maids of Honour to a Princess\". Only nine are known of in detail; the other was St George's Inn.\n\nThe ten Inns were:\n\n\nMany Inns were originally independent of the Inns of Court, and fell in and out of allegiance with them, with some claiming independence right up to the nineteenth century. Most Inns became directly attached to Inns of Court during the sixteenth century, however, when the Inns of Court began charging higher acceptance fees to students trained in independent Inns of Chancery than they did to students trained in \"their\" Inns of Chancery.\n\nClement's Inn was the last to be dissolved, being shut down in 1903. Located near St Clement Danes, the Inn was also named after Saint Clement and took as its coat of arms his, with a large letter C in sable. The buildings were completely rebuilt in the 19th century in the Queen Anne Style. Noted members included Sir Edmund Saunders, and William Shakespeare made Justice Shallow, a character in \"Henry IV, Part 2\", a member of the Inn. Members were noted as \"a wild lot\" known for their drinking and parties. In its later years the Inn was a poor one, and had no library or chapel, with most of the funds being spent on repairs and maintenance for the building.\n\nLyon's Inn was \"a place of considerable antiquity\", with records from 1413. Originally a hostel, it was purchased by the inhabitants and turned into an Inn of Chancery. Initially a small but respected Inn that educated people as noted as Sir Edward Coke, Lyon's Inn became a disreputable institution that \"perished of public contempt long before it came to the hammer and the pick\". By the time it was dissolved it was inhabited only by the lowest lawyers and those struck off the rolls, and when surveyed it was found that it was run by only two Ancients, neither of whom had any idea what their duties were, and the Inn had not dined for over a century. The Inn was dissolved in 1863 and replaced with the third Globe Theatre. \n\nClifford's Inn was the oldest of the Inns of Chancery, and was first mentioned in 1344. Although generally considered a dependent of the Inner Temple, its members always maintained that they were independent. As a note of that \"independence\" it became custom for the Inner Temple to send them a message once a year, which would be received but deliberately not replied to. Their coat of arms was a modified form of the Clifford family arms, with \"cheque or and azure, a fess gules, a bordure, bezantée, of the third.\" Noted students include John Selden; Sir Edward Coke was also said to have studied there, but historical records find no evidence of this, and he was always associated with Lyon's Inn more than Clifford's.\n\nThe first lawyers to occupy the premises which later became the Middle Temple came from St George's Inn, arriving by 1346. The inn was later deserted in favour of New Inn.\n\nStrand Inn, also called Chester Inn, was the shortest lived of the Inns of Chancery. Founded in the fifteenth century it was pulled down in the 1540s by Lord Somerset in his role as Lord Protector so that he could build Somerset House. The students instead went to New Inn, and Strand Inn was absorbed into that Inn. Thomas Occleve was said to have studied at Strand Inn.\n\nNew Inn was founded in the late 15th century on the premises of Our Lady Inn, a hostel. Noted students included Sir Thomas More, who attended New Inn before going to Lincoln's Inn. The buildings of New Inn were pulled down in 1902 to make way for a road between Holborn and the Strand. After the destruction of Strand Inn, New Inn was the only Inn of Chancery left attached to the Middle Temple.\n\nFurnival's Inn was founded before or during the reign of Henry IV and named after the Lords Furnival. During the 1820s the Inn was completely rebuilt. Noted tenants include Charles Dickens, who began to write \"The Pickwick Papers\" whilst living there. The Inn was demolished in 1897.\n\nThavie's Inn was the second oldest Inn of Chancery, and was founded around 1349. It was sold in 1769. Lawyers from Thavie's Inn were the first to occupy the premises which became Inner Temple in the 1320s.\n\nStaple Inn dated from at least 1415, and was originally an inn where wool merchants stayed and haggled. In reference to this, the Inn coat of arms contained a bale of wool. During the reign of Elizabeth I it was the largest of the Inns of Chancery, with 145 students and 69 as permanent residents. The buildings survived the great fire of London and were rebuilt in the seventeenth century, and again in the nineteenth. The Inn was shut down and the building sold to the Prudential Assurance Company in 1884, and part of it is now used as the headquarters of the Institute of Actuaries.\n\nBarnard's Inn, originally known as Mackworth's Inn after its owner, John Mackworth, was established in 1454 as an Inn of Chancery. A large Inn, Barnard's had 112 students a year during the reign of Elizabeth I with 24 in permanent residence. When it was an institute of legal education, it enforced the odd practice of fining a student when he got something wrong: a halfpenny for a defective word, a farthing for a defective syllable and a penny for an improper word. Barnard's was under the supervision of Gray's Inn, who traditionally sent a Reader to the Inn every year, who was treated with great respect. Noted pupils included Sir John Holt, later a distinguished jurist. The Inn was badly damaged in the Gordon Riots after a rioter set fire to the distillery next door. In 1880 it was bought by the Worshipful Company of Mercers and used to house the Mercers' School.\n\n\n"}

A will made by a testator suffering from an insane delusion that affects the provisions made in the will may fail in whole or in part. Only the portion of the will caused by the insane delusion fails, including potentially the entire will. Will contests often involve claims that the testator was suffering from an insane delusion. \n\nAn insane delusion is distinct from testamentary capacity. A testator might be suffering from an insane delusion but otherwise possess the requisite capacity to make a will. Similarly, an insane delusion is distinct from a mere mistake. If suffering from an insane delusion, a testator is not subject to change his or her mind regarding the delusion if presented with contrary evidence, whereas a mistake is capable of being corrected if the testator is told the truth. Additionally, while an insane delusion may cause portions of a will to fail, most courts will not reform or invalidate a will because of a mistake unless it was the result of fraud.\n\nThe insane delusion concept was created in the 1826 British case \"Dew v. Clark\". In that case, a father believed that his daughter was \"the devil incarnate\" and disinherited her in his will of 1818. After her father's death, evidence presented by the daughter showed that she was well known for her good disposition and that her father had falsely told others that he lavished his daughter with praise and wealth. The probate court found that the father's mindset when he made the 1818 will was normal in all respects except toward his daughter. The court found that his thoughts about her, \"did and could only proceed from, and be founded in, insanity,\" a \"partial insanity\" that only extended to his thoughts about his daughter and caused him to disinherit her. The court said that this delusion caused the will to fail.\n\nIn the 1854 case \"Addington v. Wilson\", the Supreme Court of Indiana held that a testator who disinherited his daughters because he believed them to be witches was not for that reason alone so insane as to deem him incapable of making a valid will. The court justified its decision by pointing to distinguished jurists and religious figures who affirmed the possibility of witchcraft; if these people's beliefs did not render them insane, neither did the testator's.\n\nIn \"In re Robertson's Estate\" (1948), the Supreme Court of Oklahoma held that a testator who declared that he had \"no children\" and \"no deceased children\" in his will, when he actually had two living children, was suffering from an insane delusion, as the testator had \"no rational basis whatsoever\" to declare that he had no children.\n"}

It is related to the 27-year long dispute between Republic of Macedonia and Greece over the former's name, an issue which has prevented the accession of Macedonia to the European Union and NATO. The government had carried out a social media campaign about the issue of the referendum. The proposal ultimately failed on a constitutional ground because the turnout of eligible voters was not over 50 percent, according to the election commission. This led the opposition to claim victory, while the government did as well by arguing that the result being non-binding meant the turnout requirement was pointless in the first place. Being non-binding, as well as including constitutional changes, its result will still need to be approved by two-thirds of parliament. Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has vowed to push forward with the changes in parliament.\n\nFollowing Macedonia's independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, successive Greek governments have claimed that the country's name implied territorial claims on Greek Macedonia and have objected to the use of \"Macedonia\" by the new state. It was admitted to the United Nations in 1993 as \"the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\" (FYROM), while most countries have recognised the Republic of Macedonia under its constitutional name.\n\nRepeated attempts at negotiation for a composite name failed for 27 years. However, in 2018, high-level contacts between the governments of the two countries intensified, with the Macedonian Deputy Prime Minister Bujar Osmani visiting Athens for the name talks on 9 January, and Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev meeting with his Greek counterpart Alexis Tsipras on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland on 24 January. In the Davos meeting, the first of its kind in seven years, there appeared to be some resolution between the two leaders to end the naming dispute and to improve the relations between the two countries. Zaev subsequently agreed to take initiatives that would soothe Greek concerns over antiquisation policies, while Tsipras agreed to consent to Macedonia's bid to join regional initiatives or agreements.\n\nOn 12 June 2018, Tsipras announced that he had reached an agreement with Zaev \"which covers all the preconditions set by the Greek side\". The proposal would result in the Republic of Macedonia being renamed the Republic of North Macedonia (), with the new name being used for all purposes. Zaev announced that the deal includes recognition of the Macedonian language in the United Nations and that the citizenship of the country will be called, Macedonian/citizen of the Republic of North Macedonia. Also, there would be an explicit clarification that the citizens of the country are not related to the ancient Macedonians. \"The agreement once and for always confirms and strengthens the Macedonian ethnic and cultural identity, the Macedonian language, the Macedonian nationality. It guarantees the security of the country and provides a secure future for the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia\", Zaev said. These changes were to be put to a referendum for citizens of the Republic of Macedonia in September 2018. Additionally, the agreement stipulates the removal of the Vergina Sun from public use in the Republic of Macedonia and the formation of a committee for the review of school textbooks and maps in both countries for the removal of irredentist content and to align them with UNESCO and Council of Europe's standards. The agreement was signed at Lake Prespa, a body of water which is divided among Macedonia, Greece and Albania.\n\nParliament paved the way for the referendum by ratifying the agreement for a second time in early July. After a month long delay by the opposition party VMRO-DPMNE to slow down the referendum preparation by not appointing members to the State Election Commission, the parliament finally agreed as of the end of July on a new composition.\n\nThe text of the question put to voters was:\n\nMacedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev and the government coalition started an online campaign for a “Yes” vote in the referendum. Many high-ranked officials and EU leaders expressed their support for the \"Yes\" option as it would bring Macedonia closer to EU and NATO. Among those who visited the country in support of the referendum are Angela Merkel and Sebastian Kurz, Chancellors of Germany and Austria respectively, as well as Jim Mattis, the US Defense Secretary, and Jens Stoltenberg, the Secretary General of NATO, who encouraged the people of Macedonia to vote in favor of the new name. The Albanian President Ilir Meta, Prime Minister Edi Rama and Foreign Minister Ditmir Bushati also urged Albanians in Macedonia to support the deal and vote “Yes” in the referendum. In Macedonia, Albanian political parties and their leaders Ali Ahmeti (DUI), Menduh Thaçi (DPA), Bilall Kasami (Besa Movement) and Ziadin Sela (Alliance for Albanians) supported the “Yes” vote.\n\nThe main opposition party VMRO-DPMNE threatened to boycott the referendum and considered the deal with Greece to be an act of treason. In early September, the party's president Hristijan Mickoski came out with a statement encouraging citizens to vote as they feel it is right for their country's future, and that the party would respect different opinions. The party did not participate in the referendum campaign, while various high ranking party members voiced their support for the boycott or the “Yes” side. In early September, a cable from the US embassy in the Republic of Macedonia revealed by WikiLeaks showed that the 2008 VMRO-DPMNE government was willing to accept the name , for international and bilateral use only, provided it included the recognition of the Macedonian language and nationality. That proposal was rejected by Greece. The information has been denied by media close to the party, which have stated that VMRO-DPMNE was only willing to accept changing the FYROM reference to North Macedonia, while keeping the constitutional name the same. On 23 September, Macedonia's President Gorge Ivanov, who was elected as a candidate of the VMRO-DPMNE, decried the agreement and called on his compatriots to boycott the vote. Various other small anti-Western organizations with pro-Serbian and pro-Russian orientations have also organized protests against the name change.\n\nAmong the Macedonian diaspora, the majority of Macedonians living in Australia expressed that they would boycott the referendum vote.\n\nVarious diplomats and analysts, including U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, have accused Russia of engaging in a campaign to undermine the referendum. Russia is opposed to any additional countries joining NATO or the European Union. Thousands of fake Twitter and Facebook accounts urged Macedonians to boycott the vote. Some Facebook postings asked \"are you going to let Albanians change your name?\", attempting to exploit ethnic divisions in the country. The \"No\" lobby banked on a boycott that could render the referendum result meaningless. Two Russian diplomats were expelled from Greece due to accusations of attempting to undermine relations with Macedonia, and a year earlier Russian citizens were arrested related to a failed coup in Montenegro attempting to prevent that country from joining NATO.\n\nIn fifteen municipalities of Macedonia predominantly inhabited by Albanians, voter turnout was at 233,000 people and marginally less than in the local elections of 2017. Albanians from Macedonia residing in Western Europe ignored voting in the referendum.\n\nWestern leaders welcomed the result as positive, despite the low turnout. The European Union's Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Negotiations, Johannes Hahn, called the “Yes” vote \"very significant\" and urged Macedonia's political leaders to \"respect this decision and take it forward with utmost responsibility\". NATO chief, Jens Stoltenberg, in his post on Twitter described the referendum as a \"historic opportunity\", while reaffirming that \"NATO’s door is open\" for Macedonia. The United States also welcomed the outcome, with the State Department urging Macedonian lawmakers \"to rise above partisan politics and seize this historic opportunity\" in implementing the Prespa agreement, which could enable Macedonia to become \"a full participant in Western institutions\".\nGreece's Foreign Ministry welcomed the positive result, but described it as \"contradictory\" to the low vote turnout, and the Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras phoned his Macedonian counterpart Zoran Zaev right after the referendum to congratulate him for the positive outcome.\n\nRussia, a staunch opponent of Macedonia's Euro-Atlantic integration, on the other hand, hinted that it could veto the Prespa agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and Greece, by bringing it to the United Nations Security Council. Macedonia dismissed Moscow's threats by stating that bilateral agreements can not be dependent on the Security Council.\n\nOn 19 October 2018, Macedonia’s Parliament voted to start the process of renaming the country Republic of North Macedonia. A total of 80 deputies in the 120-seat parliament voted in favour of the renaming proposal—just reaching the two-thirds majority needed to enact constitutional changes, a quorum only needing to be met, and no more.\n"}
{"id": "32327804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32327804", "title": "Memorialization", "text": "Memorialization\n\nMemorialization generally refers to the process of preserving memories of people or events. It can be a form of address or petition, or a ceremony of remembrance or commemoration.\n\nMemorialization is a universal need for both those being memorialized and those who are grieving. Although historically it was limited to the elite and only practiced in the highest societal classes, it is now almost considered a fundamental human right for all people.\n\nIn the context of transitional justice, memorialization is used to honor the victims of human rights abuses. Memorials can help governments reconcile tensions with victims by demonstrating respect and acknowledging the past. They can also help to establish a record of history, and to prevent the recurrence of abuse.\n\nMemorials can also be serious social and political forces in democracy-building efforts.\n\nMemorials are also a form of reparations, or compensation efforts that seek to address past human rights violations. They aim to provide compensation for losses endured by victims of abuse, and remedy prior wrongdoing. They also publicly recognize that victims are entitled to redress and respect. The United Nations Basic Principles on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation recognizes “commemorations and tributes to the victims” as a form of reparation.\n\nThere are numerous types of memorials used as transitional justice initiatives. These include architectural memorials, museums, and other commemorative events. For instance, in northern Uganda, monuments, annual prayer ceremonies, and a mass grave were created in response to the war conducted by and against the Lord’s Resistance Army there.\n\nAnother example is the Museum of Memory and Human Rights in Chile, which was created to document abuses by the former military dictatorship there.\n\nMemorialization can arouse controversy and present certain risks. In unstable political situations, memorials may increase desire for revenge and catalyze further violence. They are highly politicized processes that represent the will of those in power. They are thus difficult to shape, and international relief workers, peacekeepers, and NGOs risk being drawn into disputes about the creation or maintenance of memorial sites. Yet they also have the potential to redress historical grievances and enable societies to progress.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1601218", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1601218", "title": "Money bill", "text": "Money bill\n\nIn the Westminster system (and, colloquially, in the United States), a money bill or supply bill is a bill that solely concerns taxation or government spending (also known as appropriation of money), as opposed to changes in public law.\n\nIt is often a constitutional convention that the upper house may not block a money bill. There is often another requirement that non-money bill-type clauses may not be attached to a money bill. The rationale behind this convention is that the upper house, being appointed or indirectly elected, should not have any right to decide on taxation and public expenditure-related policies as may be framed by the directly elected representatives of the lower house. Therefore, money bills are an exception to the general rule that for a bill to be enacted into a law, it has to be approved by both Houses of the Parliament—the lower house and the upper house.\n\nLoss of supply in the lower house is conventionally considered to be an expression of the house's loss of confidence in the government resulting in the government's fall.\n\nA supply bill in the Australian System is required to pass the House of Representatives, the Senate and be signed by the Governor-General. The Senate has no power or ability to introduce or modify a supply bill, but has the ability to block or defer the passing of a supply bill. The most famous instance where supply was blocked was during the 1975 constitutional crisis. This has resulted in agreements between political parties to prevent the blockage of supply bills through the Senate.\n\nA money bill is specifically defined by Article 81 of the Constitution of Bangladesh. The President of Bangladesh can send back all bills passed by the Parliament for a review except a money bill. However, a money bill can be introduced to the Parliament only at the President's recommendation. Additionally, tax can only be levied by the Parliament.\n\nProcedure for a Money Bill:\n\n\nThe concept of money bills in India came to the forefront during the enactment of the Aadhar Act, 2016. In spite of resistance by the opposition, the Aadhaar Bill was certified as a ‘money bill’ by the Speaker of the Lower House. The Upper House proposed certain amendments, but ultimately the BJP-dominated Lower House rejected the amendments suggested by the Upper House and unilaterally enacted the Aadhar Act, 2016. Immediately thereafter, Jairam Ramesh, a senior Congress leader, challenged the speaker’s decision to treat the Aadhar Bill as a ‘money bill’ before the Supreme Court of India. Article 110(3) of the Constitution of India categorically states that 'if any question arises whether a Bill is a Money Bill or not, the decision of the Speaker of the House of the People thereon shall be final'. Therefore, one of the prime constitutional questions before the Supreme Court is whether it can review the speaker’s certificate classifying a bill as a ‘money bill’. In three prior cases, the Supreme Court of India has refused to review the Speaker's certificate. However, some commentators have argued that the Court's earlier judgements were incorrect and Article 110(3) made the Speaker’s decision \"final\" for the purpose of the two Houses of the Parliament, not for the Supreme Court of India. This argument is further supported by the fact that in Kihoto Hollohan vs Zachillhu (AIR 1993 SC 412), the \"final\" decision of the speaker regarding disqualification of members of the House under the Tenth Schedule of the Indian Constitution was held to be a judicial decision subject to judicial review. This suggests that the \"final\" status given by the Indian constitution does not automatically immune the Indian speaker's decision or certificate from judicial review. In view of this crucial constitutional question, it has been suggested that the Supreme Court in \"Jairam Ramesh v. Union of India\" should create a constitution bench of at least nine judges to settle the law on this issue.The five judge bench in the ratio 4-1 decided that the Aadhar Bill was a Money Bill\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, the Senate may not delay a money bill () more than 21 days. The President of Ireland may not refuse to sign a money bill and may not refer such a bill to the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality. Procedures exist for resolution of disputes as to whether a Bill is a money bill. Since the 1922 constitution (as amended by the Constitution (Amendment No. 12) Act 1930) and under the 1937 constitution, such disputes can be resolved by a committee on privileges.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, section 1(1) of the Parliament Act 1911 provides that the House of Lords may not delay a money bill more than a month. It is at the discretion of the Speaker of the House of Commons to certify which bills are money bills, and his decision is final and is not subject to challenge. Section 1(2) of the Act states:\nA Money Bill means a Public Bill which in the opinion of the Speaker of the House of Commons contains only provisions dealing with all or any of the following subjects, namely, the imposition, repeal, remission, alteration, or regulation of taxation; the imposition for the payment of debt or other financial purposes of charges on the Consolidated Fund, the National Loans Fund or on money provided by Parliament, or the variation or repeal of any such charges; supply; the appropriation, receipt, custody, issue or audit of accounts of public money; the raising or guarantee of any loan or the repayment thereof; or subordinate matters incidental to those subjects or any of them. In this subsection the expressions \"taxation,\" \"public money,\" and \"loan\" respectively do not include any taxation, money, or loan raised by local authorities or bodies for local purposes.\n\nThe Parliament Act 1911 was the product of the political crisis of 1909. The People's Budget of 1909 proposed by the House of Commons was rejected by the House of Lords. A government whose budget (that is the Finance Bill) is rejected can only resign or dissolve Parliament, because without money it is impossible to govern. The rejection of the Finance Bill in 1909 by the Lords prompted the then British government to initiate steps to curtail the powers of the House of Lords in this regard. This is evident from the Preamble of the 1911 Act which states: \"An Act to make provision with respect to the powers of the House of Lords in relation to those of the House of Commons ...\".\n\nThe reference to the National Loans Fund was inserted on 1 April 1968 by section 1(5) of the National Loans Act 1968.\n\nFor this purpose, the expression \"Public Bill\" does not include any Bill for confirming a Provisional Order.\n\nBradley and Ewing said that the statutory definition of Money Bill is \"strictly interpreted\". Most annual Finance Bills have not been certified to be Money Bills.\n\nWhile the United States of America is not a parliamentary democracy, the Origination Clause of the U.S. Constitution requires that all bills raising revenue originate in the House of Representatives, consistent with British constitutional practice; by convention, appropriation bills (bills that \"spend\" money) also originate in the House. Unlike in most Westminster systems, there are no limits on the Senate's ability to amend revenue bills or any requirement for the Senate to approve such bills within a certain timeframe. Both appropriations and revenue bills are often referred to as money bills to contrast them with authorization bills. The U.S. Supreme Court in United States v. Munoz-Flores (1990) held that: \"A law passed in violation of the Origination Clause would thus be no more immune from judicial scrutiny because it was passed by both Houses and signed by the President than would be a law passed in violation of the First Amendment\".\n\n"}

The term is used in the Clean Air Act Extension of 1970 (CAA) to refer to air pollution emission standards, and in the Clean Water Act (CWA) referring to standards for water pollution discharges of industrial wastewater to surface waters.\n\nSome pollution control laws are organized with varying degrees of stringency. The different standards may be based on several factors, including whether the pollution source is an existing facility at the time the standard is published, or is constructed after publication. The standards for new sources may be more stringent than that for existing facilities, on the principle that a new plant can be designed with the latest and most advanced control technologies.\n\nThe Clean Air Act NSPS dictate the level of pollution that a new stationary source may produce. These standards are authorized by Section 111 of the CAA and the regulations are published in 40 CFR Part 60. NSPS have been established for a number of individual industrial or source categories. Examples:\n\n\nUnder the Clean Water Act, NSPS set the level of allowable wastewater discharges from new industrial facilities. EPA issues NSPS for categories of industrial dischargers, typically in conjunction with the issuance of effluent guidelines for existing sources. In developing NSPS, the CWA requires that EPA determine the \"best available demonstrated control technology\" (BADCT) for the particular industrial category. BADCT may be more stringent than the best available technology economically achievable standard used for existing dischargers. This consideration may include setting a \"no discharge of pollutants standard\" (also called a \"zero discharge\" standard) if practicable.\n\nNSPS regulations are published at 40 CFR Subchapter N (Parts 405-499). NSPS issued by EPA include the following categories:\n\nEPA has published a general definition of \"new source\" in the federal wastewater permit regulations.

However, there are two exceptions to this rule: expert evidence and non-expert opinion given by laymen which people in their daily lives reach without conscious ratiocination.\n\nIn general, witnesses should testify only as to the facts observed and should not give opinion.\n\nThe main rationale for such a rule is that the admission of opinion evidence would not assist, or might even mislead, the court and in particular the jury. This is because opinion evidence is usually irrelevant. Moreover, admission of such evidence would usurp the functions of the jury, which alone should be the tribunal of fact and draw its own inferences.\n\nAn expert witness is a witness, who by virtue of education, training, skill, or experience, is believed to have expertise and specialised knowledge in a particular subject beyond that of the average person, sufficient that others may officially and legally rely upon the witness's specialized (scientific, technical or other) opinion about an evidence or fact issue within the scope of his expertise, referred to as the expert opinion, as an assistance to the fact-finder. Expert witnesses may also deliver expert evidence about facts from the domain of their expertise. The facts upon which an expert opinion is based must be proved by admissible evidence. The duty of experts is to furnish the judge with the necessary scientific criteria for testing the accuracy of their conclusions, so that the judge or jury can form their own independent judgment by the application of these criteria to the facts proved.\n\nNon-expert opinion refers to the opinion given in restricted circumstances by laymen or persons who do not possess any expertise. These circumstances mainly concern matters of everyday life where a person may be expected to give opinions and which opinions may be safely acted upon by others.\n\nSuch circumstances cannot be definitively laid out in a closed list of cases. However, cases in which non-expert opinion has been admitted include:\n"}

On 10 July he issued two decrees, one calling Congressional elections for 24 August and one for a referendum on constitutional reform on the following day. The newly elected Congress would be able to discuss and supplement the constitution, but would be bound by the referendum result.\n\nThe new constitution had 19 chapters. It provided for a presidential term of five years, with the President elected by Congress. Congress would be elected in whole every five years, whilst there would also be three Provincial Assemblies. It also provided for six years of free and compulsory primary education, limited the death penalty to cases of murder and treason, and ensured that martial law could not curtail personal freedoms.\n\nAfter being approved by voters, the constitution was adopted by Congress on 27 December 1919 by a vote of 79 to 0.\n"}

It is more familiar to the public as the regulation that limits monthly withdrawals from savings accounts.\n\nThe regulation requires depository institutions to keep cash reserves in order to meet immediate withdrawals against their transaction accounts. The minimum reserve requirement is 3% of the total amount over $16 million, and an additional 7% of the amount over $122.3 million. The institution may satisfy the requirement with vault cash and with deposits at a Federal Reserve Bank, or a bank that acts as a Federal Reserve correspondent. Bankers' banks and corporate credit unions, which act only as correspondents for other institutions, are not subject to the reserve requirements. The Federal Reserve Board of Governors may require additional reserves after consulting Congress or deposit insurance authorities.\n\nIn consumer banking, \"Regulation D\" often refers to §204.2(d)(2) of the regulation, which limits withdrawals or outgoing transfers from a savings or money market account. No more than six such transactions per statement period may be made from an account by various \"convenient\" methods, which include checks, debit card payments, and automatic transactions such as automated clearing house transfers or electronic bill payment. Institutions must warn any customer that exceeds the limit and must freeze, close or reclassify accounts that do so repeatedly. The regulation does not limit transactions made in person, at an ATM, by mail, or by telephone request for a mailed check. Even in these cases, the institution may require seven-day advance written notice before releasing funds. This right is not normally exercised, but it must be part of the account agreement.\n\nEach institution sets its own specific policies for responding to violations of the limit. Discover Bank, for example, will close a savings account if Regulation D is exceeded 3 or more times in a 12-month period. Wells Fargo charges a $15 \"Excess Activity Fee\" for each item cleared after the regulation has been exceeded, and converts the account to a checking account if the activity persists.\n\nThe regulation was amended in 2009 to allow greater freedom for the depositor: beforehand, the limit was six withdrawals per month if the funds remained within the same institution (e.g., transfer to checking), but was only three drafts where the funds left the institution (e.g., check, ACH Network, or card based purchase).\n\n\n"}

It was founded in Madison, Wisconsin in 1974 by a pair of college students who took the name from a character invented in 1969 by the Firesign Theatre. The Firesign Theatre claimed ownership of the name and threatened legal action in 1985, but according to legal precedent set by a similar case in Austin, Texas, they had weakened their case for copyright infringement in a 1975 visit to the first Rocky Rococo store, when they gave the owners autographed pictures, which implied their approval of the name use. The chain grew as large as 120 stores in 1986, and the owners sold the franchise rights to another partner and group of investors in 1988. Today there are still 40 locations in the Midwest.\n\nWayne Mosley and Roger Brown opened their first store in Madison, Wisconsin, in 1974. \nThe name \"Rocky Rococo\" was invented in 1969 by the Firesign Theatre for a villain in the \"Further Adventures of Nick Danger\" sketch on their second comedy album, \"How Can You Be in Two Places at Once When You're Not Anywhere at All\". The character was based on Dashiell Hammett's Joel Cairo as portrayed by Peter Lorre in the 1941 film \"The Maltese Falcon\". The name is a parody of a character invented by the Beatles for their song \"Rocky Raccoon\". The Firesign character is described as a dwarf and depicted as bald and wearing a fez. The company's web site does not mention either the Firesign Theatre or the Beatles character as inspiration for the name.\n\nTo design their restaurant's logo, Mosley and Brown hired a Madison artist to sketch a character based on the White Spy character from Mad Magazine, and hired comic actor Jim Pederson to portray their \"Rocky Rococo\" mascot as a moustachioed Italian wearing a white suit, wide-brimmed hat, and sunglasses. Pederson died at age 68 on February 4, 2016.\n\nThe Firesign Theatre visited the first Rocky Rococo Pizza when on tour in Madison in 1975, and reacted with good humor, joking around with the owners and giving them pictures that said, \"To Rocky, from Rocky\" which were hung on the wall. But in 1985, when the chain had grown to 62 restaurants, the Firesign Theatre sent the owners a letter claiming ownership of the name. Their lawyers found a similar case where an Austin, Texas pizzeria named Conan's ran afoul of the copyright owners, producers of the 1982 film \"Conan the Barbarian\". Since the creator of the \"Conan the Barbarian\" comic had similarly endorsed the restaurant by drawing Conan on its walls, the suit lost in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. So the Firesigns settled out of court.\n\nBy 1986, the chain had grown to 120 stores, according to the company. Mosley and Brown sold the franchise rights to Tom Hester and a group of investors in 1988. Mosley died at his home in Madison on November 28, 2017, aged 70.\n\n, there were 40 Rocky Rococo locations, mostly in Wisconsin, and one each in Minnesota and Washington. The chain generates about $40 million in annual sales. The chain previously had locations in Florida, Colorado, Nebraska, Missouri, Michigan, Iowa, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky and Ohio.\n\n"}

Of the six defendants, one was convicted of murder, two were convicted of assault on correctional officers, and three were acquitted of all charges.\n\nDuring the escape, which sparked a riot on the cellblock, Jackson had a .32 caliber pistol allegedly smuggled into the prison by attorney Stephen Bingham. Immediately after the incident, Bingham went on the run and fled the country for 13 years; he returned in 1984 to stand trial, and was acquitted of all charges in 1986. Bingham's defense had argued that guards had smuggled George Jackson the gun, hoping that he would be killed. During the ensuing riot, George Jackson, three corrections officers, and two inmates were killed.\n\nIn addition to Jackson, those killed in the altercation were guards Paul E. Krasenes, 52, Frank DeLeon, 44, and Jere P. Graham, 39, as well as inmates John Lynn, 29, and Ronald L. Kane, 28. Spain was found guilty in the shooting deaths of guards DeLeon and Graham, Pinell was convicted of cutting the throats of guards Charles Breckenridge and Urbano Rubiaco, Jr. (died 2013), both of whom survived, and Johnson was convicted of assaulting Breckenridge. There were no convictions for the killings of Krasenes, Lynn, or Kane. Drumgo, Talamantaz, and Tate were found not guilty of all charges, including various counts of murder, conspiracy, and assault.\n\nPrison officials stated that attorney Stephen Bingham and a female assistant arrived at San Quentin for a meeting with George Jackson at around 2:00 pm. The assistant handed a briefcase to Bingham when she was not permitted to enter the visiting room.\n\nAccording to an Associated Press report based on interviews with prison officials, a cursory search of Bingham's briefcase was performed and a guard failed to open a tape recorder case that was in it. This report stated that the briefcase was returned to Bingham after he walked through a metal detector. An article in the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" based on the reports of officials provided a slightly different version by stating that Bingham had triggered the metal detector while carrying the briefcase through it. That report indicated that an officer opened the briefcase and found a cassette tape recorder, then inspected its battery compartment to determine whether it was functional. Prison officials later came to believe that the working components of the recorder had been removed to allow room for an automatic handgun with its grip handles removed. Initial reports described the weapon as a 9 mm pistol made by the Spanish manufacturer Llama firearms.\n\nJackson was strip searched in San Quentin's Adjustment Center, then escorted to the visiting room. He sat across from Bingham at a wooden table that had no barriers between the two and was intermittently observed by guards. Officials speculated that during this time Bingham passed the gun to Jackson, who concealed it in his hair under a watch cap. The meeting lasted about 15 minutes. Around 2:35 pm, Jackson was escorted by officer Frank DeLeon back to the Adjustment Center, where another officer performed a second search prior to returning Jackson to his cell. When that officer asked Jackson about what appeared to be a pencil in his hair, Jackson pulled the gun out, pointed it at the officers, and inserted a magazine. He reportedly shouted, \"This is it!\", and ordered all of the officers to lie face down on the floor. Jackson then ordered an officer to get up and activate a switch that opened all 34 cells on the first floor.\n\nAccording to the \"Chronicle\", officer Charles Breckenridge's throat was slashed and he was dragged to Jackson's cell; Breckenridge survived. On top of him were thrown the bodies of officers Frank DeLeon and Paul Krasenes, as well as those of two white inmates (John Lynn and Ronald L. Kane). Sergeant Jere Graham was killed by inmates when he came to the Adjustment Center to pick up DeLeon for another assignment. An alarm was eventually sounded and Jackson and Johnny Spain ran from the Adjustment Center. Initial reports indicated that at approximately 2:55 pm, Jackson was shot once in the foot and once in the top of the head as he attempted to flee.\n\nDuring the trial, Tate was freed on $50,000 bail. Defense attorneys presented a conspiracy theory suggesting that prison and law enforcement officials set up Jackson to be killed. The prosecution asserted that the escape attempt was a conspiracy that involved radicals sympathetic to Jackson.\n\nAfter deliberating for 24 days, the Marin County jury of five men and seven women rendered their verdicts for 46 separate felony counts on August 12, 1976. Marin County Superior Court Judge Henry J. Broderick spent 45 minutes reading the verdicts. The trial ended as the longest in California history, during which 23,000 pages of testimony were collected.\n\nFleeta Drumgo (1945 – November 26, 1979) was born to Inez Williams in Shreveport, Louisiana.\n\nAccording to the \"Daily Review\" (Hayward, California), Drumgo moved to Los Angeles at the age of 3, and had been in and out of juvenile detention homes since the age of 13. According to Fania Davis Jordan, the sister of Angela Davis, he moved to Los Angeles at the age of 14, was placed in the Preston School of Industry and upon his release was sentenced to the Deuel Vocational Institution near Tracy, California, after an arrest for attempted murder.\n\nDrumgo was later charged with the December 1966 burglary of a television and radio store in the Los Angeles suburb of South Gate. According to court documents, Drumgo initially admitted his involvement in the break-in after he was found by officers at the address for which the getaway car used by his accomplice was registered. In early 1967, he was convicted of first degree burglary after waiving a jury trial. He was referred to the California Youth Authority but was found to be \"not capable of reformation under their discipline\".\n\nIn September 1967, the court, pursuant to California Penal Code, reduced the previous conviction to secondary burglary and sentenced Drumgo to six months to 15 years in state prison.\n\nAlong with Jackson and John Clutchette, Drumgo was one of the Soledad Brothers indicted for the 1970 killing of a correctional officer at Soledad Prison. The trio received national notoriety following the publication of Jackson's book \"Soledad Brother\" and were subsequently acquitted in 1972. Twice charged and acquitted for the murder of prison guards, Drumgo was released from prison in August 1976 after serving nine years for the burglary charge.\n\nAccording to Peter Collier and David Horowitz, Drumgo approached Charles Garry two weeks after the May 1979 shooting of Fay Stender by Edward Brooks hoping to sell information he had regarding the attempted murder. Collier and Horowitz wrote: \"[Drumgo] was a member of the Black Guerrilla Family, that he had known of the BGF's plans to shoot Fay two weeks before the event and that he was willing to sell information. He reappeared on several occasions, sometimes wearing a gun in his belt, and named a former prisonmate of Brooks as head of the BGF and the man who had ordered the shooting.\"\n\nDrumgo was fatally shot in Oakland on November 26, 1979; he was living with Clutchette at the time. According to Oakland police, Drumgo had been shot by more than one weapon and witnesses reported two men leaving the scene, one with a shotgun and one with a handgun. His killers were never caught.\n\nAt his funeral, Drumgo was eulogized by Angela Davis as a \"communist martyr\".\n\nDavid Johnson (born circa 1947) was from San Diego, California. He was serving a sentence for burglary of five years to life at the time of the escape attempt. In 1985, he was reported to be a student at San Francisco State University.\n\nDuring the trial after the escape attempt at San Quentin, guard Charles Breckenridge testified that Johnson had attempted to strangle him. On August 12, 1976, Johnson was convicted on one count of assault. He was released from prison in 1993.\n\nHugo Pinell was born March 10, 1945 in Nicaragua, and died at age 71 after being stabbed by two other inmates (members of the Aryan Brotherhood) at New Folsom Prison on August 12, 2015.\n\nIn 1965, Pinell was convicted of rape in San Francisco, sentenced to life imprisonment, and placed in San Quentin State Prison. In 1968, he was convicted of attacking a guard and transferred to Folsom State Prison.\n\nIn June 1970, he was convicted of a similar assault and transferred to the California Correctional Center in Soledad, California. At Soledad, he was awaiting trial on charges of attacking another guard in December 1970. On March 3, 1971, Pinell fatally stabbed Soledad correctional officer Robert J. McCarthey after luring him to his cell under the guise of needing a letter mailed. McCarthey died in Fort Ord Army Hospital two days later.\n\nBy the time of the trial for the uprising at San Quentin, Pinell was serving a life sentence for rape as well as three others for offenses committed while in prison. Pinell was reported by a San Quentin spokesman to have been subdued by guards after he stabbed his defense attorney, Lynn Carman, during a conference at the prison on March 26, 1975.\n\nCarman denied having been stabbed or wounded, and declined additional comment on the matter. One witness to the incident reported that Carman was left bleeding from the mouth. During the trial, two San Quentin guards, Charles Breckenridge and Urbano Rubiaco, Jr., testified that Pinell had cut their throats. On August 12, 1976, Pinell was convicted of two counts of felony assault by a prisoner serving a sentence for life imprisonment. In 1985, he was serving his sentence in Folsom Prison.\n\nIn January 2009, Pinell lost his ninth bid for parole in front of officials at Pelican Bay State Prison in Crescent City, California, extending his prison term by another 15 years. On August 12, 2015, Pinell, aged 70, was killed in a prison riot at New Folsom Prison. He had been kept in solitary confinement for almost 45 years and had been released to the general population just two weeks before he was killed.\n\nJohnny Larry Spain was born July 30, 1949 in Jackson, Mississippi, to a black father, Arthur Cummings, and a white mother, Ann Armstrong. The child of an extra-marital affair, he was named Larry Michael Armstrong, taking the last name of his mother's husband, Fred Armstrong, a beer truck driver.\n\nDuring a delivery to a nightclub and restaurant in Utica, Mississippi, Fred Armstrong asked the black owner if she would take in the six-year-old boy. The woman said she could not, but contacted her husband's cousin in California who agreed to do so. At the age of six, Spain was adopted by Johnny and Helen Spain in Los Angeles where he was renamed as Johnny Larry Spain. At the time of the escape attempt at San Quentin, Spain was serving a life sentence for murder for having killed a robbery victim who resisted. Spain's attorney Charles Garry opened his defense with expert testimony from Stanford University professor and psychologist Philip Zimbardo.\n\nOn August 12, 1976, Spain was convicted of two counts of first degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder in the deaths of guards Frank DeLeon and Jere P. Graham. The only one of the Six convicted of murder, he had his conviction overturned by federal judge Thelton Henderson because Spain had been shackled throughout the proceedings. The judge placed Pelican Bay State Prison under federal receivership.\n\nAfter his conviction for the San Quentin escape was overturned, he remained in prison at Vacaville for the original murder until paroled after serving 21 years. He was granted parole in 1988 and now works in community relations in San Francisco. Spain is the father of Sahara Sunday Spain. He wrote an autobiography, Black Power, White Blood: The Life and Times of Johnny Spain.\n\nLuis Talamantez was born circa 1943. In February 1966, he was convicted of armed robbery in Los Angeles.\n\nAfter his acquittal in 1971 of the murder charge against him, Talamantez was released on parole (owing to his 1966 conviction) on August 20, 1976 and was taken to a celebration party at the Marin County home of Robert Carrow, his primary defense attorney. In 1985, Talamantez was reported to be \"living in the south\".\n\nWillie Tate was born circa 1944 or 1945 in Selma, Alabama, where he lived until he was six years old. His father was a sergeant in the United States Army. The family moved to El Paso, Texas. However, Tate could not attend school as there was no kindergarten or first grade for black children. The family moved to California and settled in Fresno when he was about eight years old.\n\nAccording to the \"San Francisco Bay Guardian\", Tate was picked up as a runaway at the age of 14 and served 10 years in prison for \"minor offenses\".\n\nOn April 26, 1977, Tate was critically wounded after being shot by Earl Satcher, the leader of a group of ex-convicts called Tribal Thumb. In 1985, Tate was reported to be a \"fugitive on a Fresno drug warrant\".\n"}
{"id": "5677268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5677268", "title": "Settlor", "text": "Settlor\n\nIn law a settlor is a person who settles property on trust law for the benefit of beneficiaries. In some legal systems, a settlor is also referred to as a trustor, or occasionally, a grantor or donor. Where the trust is a testamentary trust, the settlor is usually referred to as the testator. The settlor may also be the trustee of the trust (where he declares that he holds his own property on trusts) or a third party may be the trustee (where he transfers the property to the trustee on trusts). In British common law it has been held, controversially, that where a trustee declares an intention to transfer trust property to a trust of which he is one of several trustees, that is a valid settlement notwithstanding the property is not vested in the other trustees.\n\nCapacity to be a trustee is generally co-extensive with the ability to hold and dispose of a legal or beneficial interest in property. In practice, special considerations arise only with respect to minors and mentally incapacitated persons.\n\nA settlor may create a trust by manifesting an intention to create it. In most countries no formalities are required to create an \"inter vivos\" trust over personal property, but there are often formalities associated with trusts over real property, or testamentary trusts. The words or acts of the settlor must be sufficient to establish an intention that either another person or the settlor himself shall be trustee of the property the beneficiary; a general intention to benefit another person on its own is sufficient. These formalities apply to express trusts only, and not to resulting, implied or constructive trusts.\n\nFor a settlor to validly create a trust, in most common law legal systems they must satisfy the three certainties, established in Knight v Knight:\n\n\n\n\nWhere a settlement of property on a third party trustee by a settlor fails, the property is usually said to be held on resulting trusts for the settlor. However, if a settlor validly transfers property to a third party, and the words used are held not to create a trust, the usual rule is that the donee take the property absolutely.\n\n"}

Latvia (48321/99) was a case argued before the European Court of Human Rights and decided in 2003.\n\nMs. T. Slivenko was born in Estonia in 1959 and at the age of one month she moved to Latvia together with her parents. Her husband, N. Slivenko, born in 1952, was transferred to Latvia in 1977 to serve as a Soviet military officer. He met T. Slivenko in Latvia and married her there in 1980. In 1981, T. Slivenko gave birth to their daughter K. Slivenko.\n\nAfter Latvia regained independence, the already retired N. Slivenko was ordered to leave the country as a former Soviet/Russian officer by the Citizenship and Migration Authority, referring to the Russian-Latvian treaty of 1994. K. and T. Slivenko were ordered to leave Latvia, too, as members of N. Slivenko's family. T. Slivenko contested this decision, referring to the facts that she was a daughter of permanent residents of Latvia and she didn't come to Latvia as wife of N. Slivenko.\n\nAfter unsuccessful court proceedings, all three Slivenkos left Latvia, leaving there the parents of T. Slivenko. They contested their deportation before ECtHR. Third-party comments were received from the Russian Government, having exercised its right to intervene. In 2001, the Second Section of ECtHR has relinquished jurisdiction in favour of the Grand Chamber. In 2002, the Grand Chamber dismissed claims by N. Slivenko as inadmissible, but declared admissible the application of T. Slivenko and K. Slivenko concerning Articles 5, 8 and 14.\n\nIn the court' s evaluation, a scheme for withdrawal of foreign troops and their families based on a general finding that their removal was necessary for national security was not as such incompatible with Article 8, but implementation of such a scheme without any possibility of taking into account individual circumstances was. T. and K. Slivenkos were integrated into Latvian society at the time and could not be regarded as endangering national security because they were part of T. Slivenko's father’s family, who had retired in 1986, had remained in Latvia and was not himself considered to present any such danger.\n\nThe court therefore has found a violation of the Article 8 of ECHR in respect of K. Slivenko and T. Slivenko and no need to deal separately with the complaints under Article 14, by 11 votes against 6. The court has concluded besides, that there was no violation of Article 5, by 16 votes against 1. \n\nJudges Wildhaber, Ress, Bratza, Cabral Barreto, Greve and Maruste have filed dissenting opinions, considering that Article 8 wasn't violated. Judge Kovler has filed an opinion dissenting in part, considering that Article 5 was violated, too, and concurring in part concerning Article 8.\n\n"}

The special master should not be confused with the traditional common law concept of a master, a judge of the High Court entrusted to deal with summary and administrative matters falling short of a full trial.\n\nIn the federal judiciary of the United States, a special master is an adjunct to a federal court. Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows a federal court to appoint a master, with the consent of the parties, to conduct proceedings and report to the Court.\n\nThe role of the special master, who is frequently but not necessarily an attorney, is to supervise those falling under the order of the court to ensure that the court order is being followed and to report on the activities of the entity being supervised in a timely matter to the judge or the judge's designated representatives. Special masters have been controversial in some cases, and they are often cited by critics as an example of judicial supremacy over the other branches of government. For example, they have at times ordered the expenditure of funds over and above the amount appropriated by a legislative body for the remediation of the situation being examined. Their powers have generally been found to be valid and their remedies upheld by US courts.\n\nThe US Supreme Court will normally assign original jurisdiction disputes (cases such as disputes between states that are first heard at the Supreme Court level) to a special master to conduct what amounts to a trial court (the taking of evidence and a ruling). The Supreme Court can then assess the master's ruling much as a normal appeals court would, rather than conduct the trial itself. That is necessary as trials in the US almost always involve live testimony, and it would be too unwieldy for nine justices to rule on evidentiary objections in real time.\n\nIn United States Federal Courts, a special master is appointed under Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 53 allows for a special master to be appointed only if one of the following exists: (1) the parties consent to the appointment, (2) hold trial without a jury or make recommended findings of fact where there is some exceptional condition or accounting or difficult computation of damages, or (3) address pre-trial or post-trial matters that cannot be effectively and timely addressed by a judge or magistrate judge.\n\nThe usage of special masters in matters involving complex electronic discovery (or \"eDiscovery\") has been promulgated by the Academy of Court Appointed Masters (ACAM).\n\nThe United States Court of Federal Claims operates an Office of Special Masters to resolve claims under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, which is popularly known as the vaccine court.\n\nCases involving special masters often involve situations in which it has been shown that governmental entities are violating civil rights. High-profile cases in recent years in which special masters have been used include some in which states have been ordered to upgrade their prison facilities, which were held to violate the US Constitution, which bars cruel and unusual punishment and certain state mental hospitals, which have been found so substandard as to violate the rights of their inmates. Summaries of cases involving special masters are published at \"Cohen's Special Master Case Reporter\".\n\nIn the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks in the United States, then-Attorney General John Ashcroft appointed Kenneth Feinberg as special master to oversee the dispensation of an $11 billion victim's compensation fund.\n\nThe Waymo v. Uber lawsuit saw Judge William Haskell Alsup appoint a special master to determine whether Uber violated discovery rules in not disclosing the \"Richard Jacobs Letter\".\n\n"}

It required that certain types of contracts, wills, and grants, assignment or surrender of leases or interest in real property must be in writing and signed to avoid fraud on the court by perjury and subornation of perjury. It also required that documents of the courts be signed and dated.\n\nThe attested date for the enactment of the Statute of Frauds is 16 April 1677 (New Style)\n\nThe Act is believed to have been primarily drafted by Lord Nottingham assisted by Sir Matthew Hale, Sir Francis North and Sir Leoline Jenkins.\n\nWhen the Statute of Frauds was originally enacted, the sections of, and the clauses of section 4 of, that Act were not numbered. They were numbered when the Act was republished in the Statutes at Large. The Statute at Large, Cambridge Edition published in 1770 divided the Act into 25 sections. The section on the sale of goods was section 17. In the Statutes of the Realm published in 1818, the Statute of Frauds was divided into 24 sections. The section on the sale of goods became section 16. This article uses the same numbering system as the Statutes of the Realm.\n\nSection 1 provides that all leases, estates, and interest in freehold or term of years created by livery and seisin or parole not in writing signed by the maker shall have the effect as an estate of lease at will.\n\nSection 2 excepts from section 1 all leases not exceeding three years in term where rent equals two thirds of the value of the improved land.\n\nSection 3 provides that all leases, estates, and interest in freehold or term of years assigned granted or surrendered must be by deed or note in writing signed by the grantor or his agent or by operation of law.\n\nSection 7 provides that all conveyances in trusts of land must be in writing signed by the maker or by will.\n\nSection 9 provides that all grants and assignments of trusts in land must be in writing signed by the grantor or by will.\n\nSection 8 excepts from section 7 and 9 trusts that arise or result by implication of construction of law i.e. resulting trusts and constructive trusts.\n\nSections 1 to 3 and 7 to 9 and 24 were repealed by section 207 of, and Schedule 7 to, the Law of Property Act 1925 (15 Geo 5 c 20). However section 53(1)(a) required that interest in land be created or disposed by a signed writing, a will or operation of law. Section 53(1)(b) requires a declaration of trust in land must be by a signed writing or a will and section 53(1)(c) requires the same disposition of equitable interests and existing trusts. Section 52(2) state that section 53 does not affect the creation or operation of implied, resulting or constructive trusts. Section 54 provides interests in land created by parol and not put in writing and signed have the force and effect of interests at will only except that the lease for 3 years or less at the best rent may be made by parol.\n\nSection 4 of the Statute of Frauds provided that an action may not be brought on the following types of contracts unless there is a written note or memorandum signed by the party being charged or a person authorized by them: \n\nThis section now provides that contracts of guarantee (surety for another's debt) are unenforceable unless evidenced in writing. This requirement is subject to section 3 of the Mercantile Law Amendment Act 1856 (19 & 20 Vict c 97) which provides that the consideration for the guarantee need not appear in writing or by necessary inference from a written document.\n\nSection 6 of the Statute of Frauds Amendment Act 1828 (9 Geo 4 c 14) (commonly known as Lord Tenterden's Act) was enacted to prevent clause 2 section 4 being circumvented by bringing an action for the tort of deceit (the tort in Freeman v. Palsey).\n\nIn this section, the words \"or upon any contract or sale of lands, tenements or hereditaments or any interest in or concerning them\" were repealed by section 207 of, and Schedule 7 to, the Law of Property Act 1925 (15 Geo 5 c 20). However the requirement that contract for sale of land must be in writing was continued by section 40 of that Act. Section 40 of the Law of Property Act 1925 was repealed by sections 2(8) and 4 of, and Schedule 2 to, the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989, however section 2 of that Act requires that contracts for the sale of land be signed and in writing.\n\nAll the clauses except the one relating to surety contracts were repealed by section 1 of Law Reform (Enforcement of Contracts) Act 1954 (2 & 3 Eliz 2 c 34).\n\nThis section does not apply (if it would otherwise do so) in relation to a financial collateral arrangement.\n\nIn 1937, the Law Revision Committee recommended that this section be repealed.\n\nSections 10 and 11 deal with the execution of judgments upon equitable interests of \"cestui que\" trust in land and held free from the incumbrances of the persons seized in trust. Trust shall be pass by descent to the heir of the cestui que trust subject to charges for the oblation of the decedent, but the heir shall not become chargeable of his own estate for the obligations of the decedent.\n\nSection 13 and 14 provide that the effective date for judgments against \"bona fide\" purchasers for value of land is the date they are docketed and requiring that judgments of the courts enter the date docketed when signing it without a fee.\n\nSection 15 provides that \"fieri facias\" or other writs of execution are effective against goods from the date given it is given to the sheriff and the sheriff shall write on the back of it the day, month and year he received it without a fee.\nSection 17 provides that recognisances shall bind \"bona fide\" purchasers for value of land from the time they are enrolled and requiring that the day month and year of the recognisance be entered on the roll without a fee.\n\nSection 23 preserves the jurisdiction of ecclesiastical courts to probate wills in personal property subject to the rules of this statute. Court of Probate Act 1857 (20 & 21 Vict c 77) transferred responsibility for the granting of probate from the ecclesiastical courts of England and Wales to a new civil Court of Probate in January 1858.\n\nSection 24 proves that the husband may be the administrator of the intestate estate of a married woman as before the Statute of Distribution (22 & 23 Car 2 c 10).\n\nSections 13 and 14 were repealed by Part I of the Schedule to the Civil Procedure Acts Repeal Act 1879 (42 & 43 Vict. c 59).\n\nSections 15 was repealed by the Schedule to the Sale of Goods Act 1893, but section 26 that act continued the requiment that \"fieri facias\" or other writ of execution are effective against goods from when they are given to the sheriff and the sheriff shall endorce the writ with the date and time he received it.\n\nSection 17 was repealed by the Schedule to the Statute Law Revision and Civil Procedure Act 1881 (44 & 45 Vict. c. 59).\n\nSections 10 and 11 and 23 and 24, so far as unrepealed, were repealed by section 56 of, and Part I of Schedule 2 to the Administration of Estates Act 1925 (15 & 16 Geo 5 c 23). Section 24 was also repealed by section 207 of, and Schedule 7 to, the Law of Property Act 1925 (15 Geo 5 c 20).\n\nSection 16 proved no contract for the sale of goods for the price of ten pounds sterling or more shall be good except if the buyer shall accept part of the goods and actually receive the same or give some thing in earnest to bind the bargain or in part of payment, or that some note or memorandum in writing of the said contract signed by the parties to be charged by such contract or their authorized agents. This section was amended by section 7 of the Statute of Frauds Amendment Act 1828 (9 Geo. 4 ch 14) to cover goods to be delivered in the future, not yet manufactured, or not yet fit for delivery.\n\nSections 16 was repealed by the Schedule to the Sale of Goods Act 1893 (56 & 57 Vict c 71). However its terms were substantially re-enacted as section 4 of the Sales of Goods Act 1893.\nSection 4 of the Sales of Goods Act 1893 was repealed by the Law Reform (Enforcement of Contracts) Act 1954.\n\nSection 5 requires that wills devising land be in writing signed by the person devising the property or some other person at his direction,and shall be attested and subscribed in the presence of the said testator by three or four credible witnesses.\n\nSection 6 provides that a gift of land in a will may only be revoked by another will or a codicil or other writing declaring the revocation executed in the same manner as a will is by section 5 or by testator or someone at his direction and in his presence burned, cancelled, torn or obliterated.\n\nSection 1 of the Wills Act 1751 (25 Geo 2 c 6) provides that any gift in a will to person witnessing a will is void to the extent his testimony and he is a valid witness to the execution of the will under the Statute of Frauds. Section 2 provides if there gift is a charge on land to pay debts to the witness then the charge stands and the witness is admitted.\n\nSection 12 provides that an estate \"pur autre vie\" may devised by will in writing signed by the testator or someone in his presence and at his express direction, attested and subscribed in the testators presence by three of more witnesses. It also provides for estate \"pur autre vie\" in cases where no devise is made.\n\nSections 18 through 20 provide rules for nuncupative (oral) wills for personal estates valued at over 30 pounds may be only made during the last illness of a testator. After six months have passed from the speaking of the will no testimony shall be received to prove a nuncupative will unless the testimony of the substance of it was committed to writing within six days of making the will. A nuncuparative will must be witnessed by three witnesses.\n\nSection 16 of the Administration of Justice Act 1705 (4 & 5 Ann c 3) provided that any witness who could testify in court could witness a nuncuparative will.\n\nSection 21 provides that a written will in personal property may not be repealed or altered orally except if it is put in writing during the life of the testator and read to him and allowed by him and proven by at least three witnesses.\n\nSection 22 allows soldiers in actual military service and seamen at sea to dispose of their personal property as they might have done before the passage of this Act.\n\nSo much of this Act as related to devises or bequests of lands or tenements, or to the revocation or alteration of any devise in writing of any lands, tenements or hereditaments, or any clause thereof, or to the devise of any estate pur autre vie, or to any such estate being assets, or to nuncupative wills, or to the repeal, altering or changing of any will in writing concerning any goods or chattels or personal estate, or any clause, devise, or bequest therein was repealed by section 2 of the Wills Act 1837 (1 Vict c 26). The marginal note to that section said that the effect of this was to repeal sections 5 and 6 and 12 and 19 to 22. Legislation.gov.uk has this as sections 18 to 21 instead of 19 to 22.\n\nSection 22 was repealed by Part VII of the Schedule to the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1969 (c 52). However section 11 of the Wills Act 1837 continues the right of Soldiers and Seamen to dispose of their personal estate as they had previously.\n\n\n"}

The creation of the platform was triggered by the need for a strong and concerted initiative to meet the Directive on the energy performance of buildings ambitious targets for the year 2020 and overcome the challenges in relation to the envelope and ductwork leakage towards the generalization of nearly zero-energy buildings. The platform’s main activities, among others, include the production and dissemination of policy oriented publications, networking among local or national airtightness associations, as well as the organization of conferences, workshops and webinars.\n\nTightVent Europe was launched and initiated in January 2011 by INIVE EEIG (International Network for Information on Ventilation and Energy Performance), a registered European Economic Interest Grouping (EEIG) whose members include building research centres in Europe. Since then, the platform has received the financial and/or technical support from its partners: Buildings Performance Institute Europe, BlowerDoor GmbH, Lindab, MEZ-TECHNIK, Retrotec, Eurima, Soudal, Industrias Gonal and SIGA.\n\nThe target audience of the TightVent Europe activities ranges from the research community over designers, practitioners, supply industry to European, national and regional government policy makers. It includes policy makers, training centres, designers, engineers and builders, air leakage testers, local and national airtightness associations, research and technical centres.\n\nIn September 2012, TightVent Europe launched the TightVent Airtightness Associations Committee (TightVent TAAC committee) with the primary goal to promote reliable testing and reporting procedures. At present, the participants are from Belgium, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Norway, Poland, Sweden, UK and the US. The scope of this committees includes various aspects such as:\n\nSince 2011, TightVent Europe has published 6 reports in the fields of building and ductwork airtightness. The first publication on the challenges for building and ductwork airtightness was released in 2011 entitled as: “Critical steps for a wide scale implementation of building and ductwork airtightness”. It included an introductory paper browsing the issues of concern and collect a series of technical documents, namely those produced within the ASIEPI project as well as within the SAVE-DUCT and AIRWAYS projects. Another publication: “Methods and techniques for airtight buildings” was released in 2012, with an overview to the design principles and construction methods for building airtightness. Moreover, the publication: \"Building air leakage databases in energy conservation policies: Analysis of selected initiatives in 4 European countries and the USA\" was also released in 2012 with information on existing envelope air leakage databases from five countries: Czech Republic, France, Germany, UK and USA. Furthermore,another report was produced in close collaboration with the AIVC, \"Building airtightness: a critical review of testing reporting and quality schemes in 10 countries\", in 2012; a review of testing and reporting about building airtightness and quality management issues for achieving a good airtightness in 10 countries.In 2013, TightVent Europe published \"Building and ductwork airtightness: Selected papers from the REHVA special journal issue on ‘airtightness’\" composed of relevant contributions from the special issue on airtightness of the REHVA journal.\n\nTightVent Europe publishes a biannual newsletter with up to date information on developments in respect to building and ductwork airtightness, including policy issues, publications, events, innovative technologies, case studies and research activities.\n\nAnnual Conference\nSince 2011, TightVent Europe holds a joint annual conference together with the Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre in September/October in one of the AIVC participating countries, with a track devoted to building and ductwork airtightness.\nWorkshops & Webinars\nBesides the publications and conferences TightVent Europe key activities include the organization of workshops and webinars.

{"id": "1551708", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1551708", "title": "Treaty of Amity and Commerce (United States–Japan)", "text": "Treaty of Amity and Commerce (United States–Japan)\n\nThe , also called the Harris Treaty, between the United States and Japan was signed on the deck of the in Edo (now Tokyo) Bay on July 29, 1858. It opened the ports of Kanagawa and four other Japanese cities to trade and granted extraterritoriality to foreigners, among a number of trading stipulations.\n\nThe treaty followed the 1854 Convention of Kanagawa, which granted coaling rights for US ships and allowed for a US Consul in Shimoda. Although Commodore Matthew Perry secured fuel for US ships and protection for US sailors, he left the important matter of trading rights to Townsend Harris, another US envoy who negotiated with the Tokugawa shogunate; the treaty is therefore often referred to as the \"Harris Treaty\". It took two years to break down Japanese resistance, but with the threat of looming British demands for similar privileges, the Tokugawa government eventually capitulated.\n\nAmong the most important points were:\n\n\nThe agreement served as a model for similar treaties signed by Japan with other foreign countries in the ensuing weeks. These Unequal Treaties curtailed Japanese sovereignty for the first time in its history; more importantly, it revealed Japan's growing weakness, and was seen by the West as a pretext for possible colonisation of Japan. The recovery of national status and strength became an overarching priority for the Japanese, with the treaty's domestic consequences being the end of Bakufu (Shogun) control and the establishment of a new imperial government.\n\nPerry's expedition to Japan is theoretically linked to the notion of manifest destiny, in which Americans had a \"God-given\" right to spread their political institutions and commerce across North America. The role of Japan in particular was that of a base of commerce between China and the United States. According to US Secretary of State Daniel Webster, God had placed coal for steam ships and other trading vessels \"in the depths of the Japanese islands for the benefit of the human family.\" The idea of \"Manifest Destiny\" as an imperialistic measure outside of North America was not introduced as a significant idea until the Republican bid for office in 1892, thereby suggesting, in practicality, a mere economic interest in Japan, as it held coal reserves in key locations for Pacific trade.\n\nThe Convention of Kanagawa mediated by Commodore Perry was a primary step to a rather forced extension of American influence in Japan. However, most problems that the Tokugawa Shogunate faced came from a division within the country between those who favored opening to the West immediately (\"kaikoku\") and advocates of \"joi\" (\"expel the barbarian\") who favored a preservation of Japanese culture and influence until Japan could face the military threat posed by the West. Most Japanese were familiar with the subjugation of Chinese trade by the British after the Opium War of 1840, but they were divided on how and when they would inevitably open their ports. Both camps did agree that trade should be handled by Japanese going overseas instead of foreigners coming into Japan and violating the country's seclusion laws. Many of those Tokugawan officials who agreed to the Treaty of Kanagawa did so in an effort to avoid war with the United States or Britain. The result was a deepening domestic crisis; after 1858, the Shogunate was trapped between the demands of the West and its powerful domestic enemies.\n\nHowever, Townsend Harris' terms were much more demanding than Perry's. Harris claimed that the laws of Japan were \"very peculiar\" and it would be unfair for foreigners to live under such rule. Article III of the treaty gave Americans the right to trade and reside in Yedo (Tokyo) and Osaka without influence from the Japanese government; the treaty also allowed for consular jurisdiction in those cities opened to American trade, the free export of Japanese gold and silver, and a conventional tariff. The entrance of foreigners to the port of Edo, the shogunal capital, and the placement of an official from a foreign government in proximity to the Emperor was threatening, even to those who supported opening to the West publicly. These demands in particular demonstrated the United States' planned role for Japan; there was to be freedom of trade, allowance for an influx of Americans, (but no expectations of Japanese coming to the United States), no interest in military concerns, and religious toleration of Japanese tradition. It was merely a link in a chain of commerce that would connect North America to China.\n\nHarris' emphasis (and threat) of the inevitable defeat of the resisting Japanese by the British and the French was enough to convince many of the \"kaikoku\" members of the Tokugawa Shogunate to agree to the terms of the United States, no matter how unfavorable they were. The memory of China's overwhelming defeat was too close to be ignored.\n\nAfter reluctantly accepting the Harris Treaty, Japan quickly signed similar treaties, called the Ansei Treaties, with Russia, France, Great Britain, and the Netherlands. This process was hastened by the outcome of the Arrow War in 1858 in which the Chinese were once again soundly defeated by the British and the French. Harris also suggested that Japan sign \"honorable treaties\" before the allied Anglo-French fleet would sail to Japan and coerce the signing of \"unequal treaties\". However, the content of those treaties did not differ in their most essential points from the Tientsin Treaty between Great Britain and China in 1858; one of the most prominent of the unequal treaties in the history of Eastern-Western foreign relations.\n\nThe Treaty was ratified through the visit of the first Japanese Embassy to the United States in 1860. The new relationship with the United States has been cited as a factor in the assassination of Ii Naosuke.\n\nAccording to a 2017 study, the treaties reducing trade barriers between Japan and Western powers caused GDP to increase in Japan by 7 percent in the immediate period.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "28222106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28222106", "title": "United Kingdom mines and quarries regulation in 1910", "text": "United Kingdom mines and quarries regulation in 1910\n\nThe United Kingdom Mines and quarries regulation in 1910 was a specialised topic in UK labour law, given the complexity of the legislation and seriousness of injuries that people suffered.\n\nThe mode of progress to be recorded in the regulation of coal mines since 1872 can be contrasted in one aspect with the progress just recorded of factory legislation since 1878. Consolidation was again earlier adopted when large amendments were found necessary, with the result that by far the greater part of the law is to be found in the act of 1887, which repealed and re-enacted, with amendments, the Coal Mines Acts of 1872 and 1886, and the Stratified Ironstone Mines (Gunpowder) Act 1881. The act of 1881 was simply concerned with rules relating to the use of explosives underground. The act of 1886 dealt with three questions: (a) The election and payment of checkweighers (i.e. the persons appointed and paid by miners in pursuance of section 13 of the act of 1887 for the purpose of taking a correct account on their behalf of the weight of the mineral gotten by them, and for the correct determination of certain deductions for which they may be liable); (\"6\") provision for new powers of the secretary of state to direct a formal investigation of any explosion or accident, and its causes and circumstances, a provision which was later adopted in the law relating to factories; (\"c\") provision enabling any relatives of persons whose death may have been caused by explosions or accidents in or about mines to attend in person, or by agent, coroners' inquests thereon, and to examine witnesses. The act of 1887, which amended, strengthened and consolidated these acts and the earlier Consolidating Act of 1872, may also be contrasted in another aspect with the general acts of factory legislation. In scope it formed, as its principal forerunner had done, a general code; and in some measure it went farther in the way of consolidation than the Factory Acts had done, inasmuch as certain questions, which in factories are dealt with by statutes distinct from the Factory Acts, have been included in the Mines Regulation Acts, \"e.g.\" the prohibition of the payment of wages in public-houses, and the machinery relating to weights and measures whereby miners control their payment; further, partly from the less changing nature of the industry, but probably mainly from the power of expression gained for miners by their organisation, the code, so far as it went, at each stage answered apparently on the whole more nearly to the views and needs of the persons protected than the parallel law relating to factories. This was strikingly seen in the evidence before the Royal Commission on Labour in 1892-1894, where the repeated expression of satisfaction on the part of the miners with the provisions as distinct from the administration of the code (\" with a few trifling exceptions \") is in marked contrast with the long and varied series of claims and contentions put forward for amendment of the Factory Acts.\n\nSince the act of 1887, there have followed five minor acts, based on the recommendation of the officials acting under the acts, while two of them give effect to claims made by the miners before the Royal Commission on Labour. Thus the Coal Mines (Checkweigher) Act 1894 rendered it illegal for an employer (\" owner, agent, or manager of any mine, or any person employed by or acting under the instructions of any such owner, agent, or manager \") to make the removal of a particular checkweigher a condition of employment, or to exercise improper influence in the appointment of a checkweigher. The need for this provision was demonstrated by a decision of the Court of Session in Edinburgh, which upheld an employer in his claim to the right of dismissing all the workmen and re-engaging them on condition that they would dismiss a particular checkweigher. In 1896 a short act extended the powers to propose, amend and modify special rules, provided for representation of workmen on arbitration under the principal act on any matter in difference, modified the provision for plans of mines in working and abandoned mines, amended three of the general rules (inspection before commencing work, use of safety lamps and non-inflammable substances for stemming), and empowered the secretary of state by order to prohibit or regulate the use of any explosive likely to become dangerous. In 1900, another brief act raised the age of employment of boys underground from twelve to thirteen. In 1903, another amending act allowed as an alternative qualification for a manager's certificate a diploma in scientific and mining training after at least two years' study at a university mining school or other educational institution approved by the secretary of state, coupled with practical experience of at least three years in a mine. In the same year, the Employment of Children Act affected children in mines to the extent already indicated in connexion with factories. In 1905, a Coal Mines (Weighing of Minerals) Act improved some provisions relating to appointment and pay of checkweighers and facilities for them and their duly appointed deputies in carrying out their duties. In 1906, the Notice of Accidents Act provided for improved annual returns of accidents and for immediate reporting to the district inspector of accidents under newly defined conditions as they arise in coal and metalliferous mines.\n\nWhile the classes of mines regulated by the act of 1887 are the same as those regulated by the act of 1872 (i.e. mines of coal, of \"Act of\" stratified ironstone, of shale and of fire-clay, including, works above ground where the minerals are prepared for \"1887 \" use by screening, washing, &c.) the interpretation of the term \" mine \" is wider and simpler, including \" every shaft in the course of being sunk, and every level and inclined plane in the course of being driven, and all the shafts, levels, planes, works, tramways and sidings, both below ground and above ground, in and adjacent to and belonging to the mine.\" Of the persons responsible under penalty for the observance of the acts the term \" owner \" is defined precisely as in the act of 1872, but the term \" agent \" is modified to mean \" any person appointed as the representative of the owner in respect of any mine or any part thereof, and, as such, superior to a manager appointed in pursuance of this act.\" Of the persons protected, the term \" young person \" disappeared from the act, and \" boy,\" \"i.e. \"\" a male under the age of sixteen years,\" and \" girl,\" \"i.e. \"\" a female under the age of sixteen years,\" take their place, and the term \" woman \" means, as before, \" a female of the age of sixteen years and upwards.\" The prohibition of employment underground of women and girls remains untouched, and the pro hibition of employment underground of boys has been successively extended from boys of the age of ten in 1872 to boys of twelve in 1887 and to boys of thirteen in 1900. The age of employment of boys and girls above ground in connexion with any mine is raised from ten years in 1872 to twelve years since 1887. The hours of employment of a boy below ground may not exceed fifty-four in any one week, nor ten in any one day from the time of leaving the surface to the time of returning to the surface. Above ground any boy or girl under thirteen (and over twelve) may not be employed on more than six days in any one week; if employed on more than three days in one week, the daily total must not exceed six hours, or in any other case ten hours. Protected persons above thirteen are limited to the same daily and weekly total of hours as boys below ground, but there are further provisions with regard to intervals for meals and prohibiting employment for more than five hours without an interval of at least half an hour for a meal. Registers must be kept of all protected persons, whether employed above or below ground. Section 38 of the Public Health Act 1875, which requires separate and sufficient sanitary conveniences for persons of each sex, was first extended by the act of 1887 to the portions of mines above ground in which girls and women are employed; underground this matter is in metalliferous mines in Cornwall now provided for by special rules. Ventilation, the only other requirement in the acts that can be classed as sanitary, is provided for in every mine in the \" general rules \" which are aimed at securing safety of mines, and which, so far as ventilation is concerned, seek to dilute and render harmless noxious or inflammable gases. The provision which prohibits employment of any persons in mines not provided with at least two shafts is made much more stringent by the act of 1887 than in the previous code, by increasing the distance between the two shafts from 10 to 15 yds., and increasing the height of communications between them. Other provisions amended or strengthened are those relating to the following points: (a) Daily personal supervision of the mine by the certificated manager; (\"b\") classes of certificates and constitution of board for granting certificates of competency; (\"c\") plan of workings of any mine to be kept up to a date not more than three months previously at the office of the mine; (\"d\") notice to be given to the inspector of the district by the owner, agent or manager, of accidents in or about any mine which cause loss of life or serious personal injury, or are caused by explosion of coal or coal dust or any explosive or electricity or any other special cause that the secretary of state specifies by order, and which causes any personal injury to any person employed in or about the mine; it is provided that the place where an explosion or accident occurs causing loss of life or serious personal injury shall be left for inspection for at least three days, unless this would tend to increase or continue a danger or impede working of the mine: this was new in the act of 1887; (\"e\") notice to be given of opening and abandonment of any mine: this was extended to the opening or abandonment of any seam; (\"f\") plan of an abandoned mine or seam to be sent within three months; (g) formal investigation of any explosion or accident by direction of the secretary of state: this provision, first introduced by the act of 1886, was modified in 1887 to admit the appointment by the secretary of state of \" any competent person \" to hold the investigation, whereas under the earlier section only an inspector could be appointed.\n\nThe \"general rules\" for safety in mines have been strengthened in many ways since the act of 1872. Particular mention may be made of rule 4 of the act of 1887, relating to the inspection of conditions as to gas ventilation beyond appointed stations \"Gencrar \" at the entrance to the mine or different parts of the mine; this rule generally removed the earlier distinction between mines in which inflammable gas has been found within the preceding twelve months, and mines in which it has not been so found; of rules 8, 9, 10 and 11, relating to the construction, use, &c., of safety lamps, which are more detailed and stringent than rule 7 of the act of 1872, which they replaced; of rule 12, relating to the use of explosives below ground; of rule 24, which requires the appointment of a competent male person not less than twenty-two years of age for working the machinery for lowering and raising persons at the mine; of rule 34, which first required provision of ambulances or stretchers with splints and bandages at the mine ready for immediate use; of rule 38, which strengthened the provision for periodical inspection of the mine by practical miners on behalf of the workmen at their own cost. With reference to the last-cited rule, during 1898 a Prussian mining commission visited Great Britain, France and Belgium, to study and compare the various methods of inspection by working miners established in these three countries. They found that, so far as the method had been applied, it was most satisfactory in Great Britain, where the whole cost is borne by the workers' own organisations, and they attributed part of the decrease in number of accidents per thousand employed since 1872 to the inauguration of this system.\n\nThe provisions as to the proposal, amendment and modification of \" special rules,\" last extended by the act of 1896, may be contrasted with those of the Factory Act. In the latter \"Special \" it is not until an industry or process has been scheduled \"p \" as dangerous or injurious by the secretary of state's order that occasion arises for the formation of special rules, and then the initiative rests with the Factory Department whereas in mines it is incumbent in every case on the owner, agent or manager to propose within three months of the commencement of any working, for the approval of the secretary of state, special rules best calculated to prevent dangerous accidents, and to provide for the safety, convenience and proper discipline of the persons employed in or about the mine. These rules may, if they relate to lights and lamps used in the mine, description of explosives, watering and damping of the mine, or prevention of accidents from inflammable gas or coal dust, supersede any general rule in the principal act. Apart from the initiation of the rules, the methods of establishing them, whether by agreement or by resort to arbitration of the parties (i.e. the mine owners and the secretary of state), are practically the same as under the Factory Act, but there is special provision in the Mines Acts for enabling the persons working in the mine to transmit objections to the proposed rules, in addition to their subsequent right to be represented on the arbitration, if any.\n\nOf the sections touching on wages questions, the prohibition of the payment of wages in public-houses remains unaltered, being re-enacted in 1887; the sections relating to payment by weight for amount of mineral gotten by persons employed, and for checkweighing the amount by a \" checkweigher \" stationed by the majority of workers at each place appointed for the weighing of the material, were revised, particularly as to the determination of deductions by the act of 1887, with a view to meeting some problems raised by decisions on cases under the act of 1872. The attempt seems not to have been wholly successful, the highest legal authorities having expressed conflicting opinions on the precise meaning of the terms \" mineral contracted to be gotten.\" The whole history of the development of this means of securing the fulfilment of wage contract to the workers may be compared with the history of the sections affording protection to piece-workers by particulars of work and wages in the textile trades since the Factory Act of 1891.\n\nAs regards legal proceedings, the chief amendments of the act of 1872 are: the extension of the provision that the \" owner, agent, \"Adminis-\" or manager \" charged in respect of any contravention. by another person might be sworn and examined as an \"tratioa \" ordinary witness, to any person charged with any offence under the act. The result of the proceedings against workmen by the owner, agent or manager in respect of an offence under the act is to be reported within twenty-one days to the inspector of the district. The powers of inspectors were extended to cover an inquiry as to the care and treatment of horses and other animals in the mine, and as to the control, management or direction of the mine by the manager.\n\nThe Coal Mines Regulation Act 1908 limiting the hours of work for workmen below ground. It enacted that, subject to various provisions, a workman was not to be below ground in a mine for the purpose of his work, and of going to and from his work, for more than eight hours in any consecutive twenty-four hours. Exception was made in the case of those below ground for the purpose of rendering assistance in the event of an accident, or for meeting any danger, or for dealing with any emergency or work incompleted, through unforeseen circumstances, which requires to be dealt with to avoid serious interference in the work of the mine. The authorities of every mine must fix the times for the lowering and raising of the men to begin and be completed, and such times must be conspicuously posted at the pit head. These times must be approved by an inspector. The term \" workman \" in the act means any person employed in a mine below ground who is not an official of the mine (other than a fireman, examiner or deputy), or a mechanic or a horse keeper or a person engaged solely in surveying or measuring. In the case of a fireman, examiner, deputy, onsetter, pump minder, fanman or furnace man, the maximum period for which he may be below ground is nine hours and a half. A registry must be kept by the authorities of the mine of the times of descent and ascent, while the workmen may, at their own cost, station persons (whether holding the office of checkweigher or not) at the pit head to observe the times. The authorities of the mine may extend the hours of working by one hour a day on not more than sixty days in one calendar year (s. 3). The act may be suspended by order in council in the event of war or of imminent national danger or great emergency, or in the event of any grave economic disturbance due to the demand for coal exceeding the supply available at any time. The act came into force on 1 July 1909 except for the counties of Northumberland and Durham where its operation was postponed until 1 January 1910.\n\nIn 1905 the number of coal-mines reported on was 3126, and the number of persons employed below ground was 691,112 of whom 43,443 were under 16 years of age. Above ground 167,261 were employed, of whom 6154 were women and girls. The number of separate fatal accidents was 1006, causing the loss of 1205 lives. Of prosecutions by far the greater number were against workmen, numbering in coal and metalliferous mines 953; owners and managers were prosecuted in 72 cases, and convictions obtained in 43 cases.\n\nFrom 1878 until 1894 open quarries (as distinct from underground quarries regulated by the Metalliferous Mines Regulation Act) were regulated only by the Factory Acts so far as they then applied. It was laid down in section 93 of the act of 1878 (41 Vict. c. 16), that \" any premises or place shall not be excluded from the definition of a factory or workshop by reason only that such premises, &c., are or is in the open air,\" thereby overruling the decision in \"Kent v. Astley\" that quarries in which the work, as a whole, was carried on in the open air were not factories; in a schedule to the same act quarries were defined as \" any place not being a mine in which persons work in getting slate, stone, coprolites or other minerals.\" The Factory Act of 1891 made it possible to bring these places in part under \" special rules \" adapted to meet the special risks and dangers of the operations carried on in them, and by order of the secretary of state they were certified, December 1892, as dangerous, and thereby subject to special rules. Until then, as reported by one of the inspectors of factories, quarries had been placed under the Factory Acts without insertion of appropriate rules for their safe working, and many of them were \" developed in a most dangerous manner without any regard for safety, but merely for economy,\" and managers of many had \" scarcely seen a quarry until they became managers.\" In his report for 1892 it was recommended by the chief inspector of factories that quarries should be subject to the jurisdiction of the government inspectors of mines. At the same time currency was given, by the published reports of the evidence before the Royal Commission on Labour, to the wish of large numbers of quarrymen that open as well as underground quarries should come under more specialised government inspection. In 1893 a committee of experts, including inspectors of mines and of factories, was appointed by the Home Office to investigate the conditions of labour in open quarries, and in 1894 the Quarries Act brought every quarry, as defined in the Factory Act 1878, any part of which is more than 20 ft. deep, under certain of the provisions of the Metalliferous Mines Acts, and under the inspection of the inspectors appointed under those acts; further, it transferred the duty of enforcing the Factory and Workshop Acts, so far as they apply in quarries over 20 ft. deep, from the Factory to the Metalliferous Mines inspectors.\n\nThe provisions of the Metalliferous Mines Acts 1872 and 1875, applied to quarries, are those relating to payment of wages in public-houses, notice of accidents to the inspector, appointment and powers of inspectors, arbitration, coroners' inquests, special rules, penalties, certain of the definitions, and the powers of the secretary of state finally to decide disputed questions whether places come within the application of the acts. For other matters, and in particular fencing of machinery and employment of women and young persons, the Factory Acts apply, with a proviso that nothing shall prevent the employment of young persons (boys) in three shifts for not more than eight hours each. In 1899 it was reported by the inspectors of mines that special rules for safety had been established in over 2000 quarries. In the reports for 1905 it was reported that the accounts of blasting accidents indicated that there was \" still much laxity in observance of the Special rules, and that many irregular and dangerous practices are in vogue.\" The absence or deficiency of external fencing to a quarry dangerous to the public has been since 1887 (50 & 51 Vict. c. 19) deemed a nuisance liable to be dealt with summarily in the manner provided by the Public Health Act 1875.\n\nIn 1905, 94,819 persons were employed, of whom 59,978 worked inside the actual pits or excavations, and 34,841 outside. Compared with 1900, there was a total increase of 924 in the number of persons employed. Fatal accidents resulted in 1900 in 127 deaths; compared with 1899 there was an increase of To in the number of deaths, and, as Professor Le Neve Foster pointed out, this exceeded the average death-rate of underground workers at mines under the Coal Mines Acts during the previous ten years, in spite of the quarrier \" having nothing to fear from explosions of gas, underground fires or inundations.\" He attributed the difference to a lax observance of precautions which might in time be remedied by stringent administration of the law. In 1905 there were 97 fatal accidents resulting in 99 deaths. In 1900 there were 92 prosecutions against owners or agents, with 67 convictions, and 13 prosecutions of workers, with 12 convictions, and in 1905 there were 45 prosecutions of owners or agents with 43 convictions and 9 prosecutions of workmen with 5 convictions.\n\nIn 1883 a short act extended to all \" workmen \" who are manual labourers other than miners, with the exception of domestic or menial servants, the prohibition of payment of wages in public-houses, beer-shops and other places for the sale of spirituous or fermented liquor, laid down in the Coal. Mines Regulations and Metalliferous Mines Regulation Acts. The places covered by the prohibition include any office, garden or place belonging to or occupied with the places named, but the act does not apply to such wages as are paid by the resident, owner or occupier of the public house, beer-shop and other places included in the prohibition to any workman \"bona fide\" employed by him. The penalty for an offence against this act is one not exceeding to (compare the limit of 20 for the corresponding,offence under the Coal Mines Act), and all offences may be prosecuted and penalties recovered in England and Scotland under the Summary Jurisdiction Acts. The act does not apply to Ireland, and no special inspectorate is charged with the duty of enforcing its provisions.\n\n"}

Perry, 545 U.S. 677 (2005), was a United States Supreme Court case involving whether a display of the Ten Commandments on a monument given to the government at the Texas State Capitol in Austin violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.\n\nIn a suit brought by Thomas Van Orden of Austin, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled in November 2003 that the displays were constitutional, on the grounds that the monument conveyed both a religious and secular message. Van Orden appealed, and in October 2004 the high court agreed to hear the case at the same time as it heard \"McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky\", a similar case challenging a display of the Ten Commandments at two county courthouses in Kentucky.\n\nThe appeal of the 5th Circuit's decision was argued by Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law scholar and the Alston & Bird Professor of Law at Duke University School of Law, who represented Van Orden on a \"pro bono\" basis. Texas' case was argued by Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott. An \"amicus curiae\" was presented on behalf of the respondents (the state of Texas) by then-Solicitor General Paul Clement.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled on June 27, 2005, by a vote of 5 to 4, that the display was constitutional. The Court chose not to employ the popular Lemon test in its analysis, reasoning that the display at issue was a \"passive monument.\" Instead, the Court looked to \"the nature of the monument and . . . our Nation’s history.\" Chief Justice William Rehnquist delivered the plurality opinion of the Court; Justice Stephen Breyer concurred in the judgment but wrote separately. The similar case of \"McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky\" was handed down the same day with the opposite result (also with a 5 to 4 decision). The \"swing vote\" in both cases was Breyer.\n\nThe monument challenged was 6-feet high and 3-feet wide, and placed in 1961. It was donated to the State of Texas by the Fraternal Order of Eagles, a civic organization, with the support of Cecil B. DeMille, who had directed the film \"The Ten Commandments\". The State accepted the monument and selected a site for it based on the recommendation of the state agency responsible for maintaining the Capitol grounds. The donating organization paid for its erection. Two state legislators presided over the dedication of the monument.\n\nThe monument was erected on the Capitol grounds, behind the capitol building (between the Texas Capitol and Supreme Court buildings). The surrounding 22 acres (89,000 m²) contained 17 monuments and 21 historical markers commemorating the \"people, ideals, and events that compose Texan identity.\"\n\nThe plurality opinion stated that the monument was constitutional, as it represented historical value and not purely religious value. The primary content is the text of the Ten Commandments. An eagle grasping the American flag, an eye inside of a pyramid, and two small tablets with what appears to be an ancient script are carved above the text of the Ten Commandments. Below the text are two Stars of David and the superimposed Greek letters Chi and Rho, which represent Christ. The bottom of the monument bears the inscription \"PRESENTED TO THE PEOPLE AND YOUTH OF TEXAS BY THE FRATERNAL ORDER OF EAGLES OF TEXAS 1961.\"\n\nBelow the above matter, and the title \"the Ten Commandments\", the monument's text reads in full:\n\n<poem>\nI AM the LORD thy God.\nThou shalt have no other gods before me.\nThou shalt not make to thyself any graven images.\nThou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain.\nRemember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.\nHonor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.\nThou shalt not kill.\nThou shalt not commit adultery.\nThou shalt not steal.\nThou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.\nThou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house.\nThou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his cattle, nor anything that is thy neighbor's.\n</poem>\n\nThomas Van Orden challenged the constitutionality of the monument. A native Texan, Van Orden passed by the monument frequently when he would go to the Texas Supreme Court building to use its law library.\n\nBreyer's concurrence in this case is made all the more interesting because on the surface it appears that he voted quite differently in \"McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky\", a case which was heard and decided at the same time and seems, to the casual observer, virtually identical. However, in \"Van Orden v. Perry\", Breyer submitted an opinion separate from that of the Court, while in \"McCreary\" he did not. As a result, the \"Van Orden\" case was decided by a plurality, not a majority as the other.\n\nIn opening his discussion of reasoning Breyer states:\n\nHe then goes on to list points which are stated to be insufficient individually, but together seem to provide a reasonable basis for \"secular purpose\":\n\nBreyer then goes on to state:\n\nBreyer continues to explain a position which seeks to balance between not \"lead[ing] the law to exhibit a hostility toward religion that has no place in our Establishment Clause of the First Amendment traditions\" and \"recogniz[ing] the danger of the slippery slope\" and ultimately rests upon a \"matter of degree [which] is, I believe, critical in a borderline case such as this one.\"\n\nBreyer concludes by stating he cannot agree with the plurality, nor with Justice Scalia's dissent in \"McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky\", but while he does agree with Justice O'Connor's statement of principles in \"McCreary\", he disagrees with her evaluation of the evidence as it bears on the applying those principles to \"Van Orden v. Perry\".\n\nStevens' dissenting opinion essentially stated that, in formulating a ruling for this case, the court had to consider whether the display had any significant relation to the specific and secular history of the state of Texas or the United States as a whole. Ultimately, Stevens asserted that the display \"has no purported connection to God's role in the formation of Texas or the founding of our Nation [. . .] \" and therefore could not be protected on the basis that it was a display dealing with secular ideals. In fact, Stevens says that the display transmits the message that Texas specifically endorses the Judeo-Christian values of the display and thus, the display violates the establishment clause.\n\n\n\n"}

Introduced in the United States House of Representatives by Congresswoman Patsy Mink of Hawaii, the legislation was conceived and drafted by Arlene Horowitz, a staff assistant to the education subcommittee on which Mink served. WEEA was intended to combat sex-role stereotyping in elementary and secondary schools.\n\nIn 1982, Leslie Wolfe, WEEA's director when Ronald Reagan was elected to the U.S. presidency, was transferred out of that position and people aligned with Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum were brought in to review grant proposals being considered for WEEA funds.

{"id": "4734157", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4734157", "title": "Éire Nua", "text": "Éire Nua\n\nÉire Nua, or \"New Ireland\", was a proposal supported by the Provisional IRA and Sinn Féin during the 1970s and early 1980s for a federal United Ireland. The proposal was particularly associated with the Dublin-based leadership group centered on Ruairí Ó Brádaigh and Dáithí Ó Conaill, who were the authors of the policy.\n\nÉire Nua is still supported by the Continuity IRA, Republican Sinn Féin, Na Fianna Éireann and Cumann na mBan.\n\nÉire Nua envisaged an all-Ireland republic that would be created when the British withdrew from Northern Ireland. It also involved the dissolution of the existing Republic of Ireland, which many republicans considered an illegitimate entity imposed by the British in 1922. Under Éire Nua, Ireland would become a federal state with parliaments for each of its four historic provinces, as well as a central parliament based in Athlone.\n\nThe purpose of the federal structure was twofold. Firstly, it was intended to show unionists in Northern Ireland that they would have some kind of self-government in a united Ireland. This would be achieved by the provision of a parliament, \"Dáil Uladh\", for Ulster. However, by including all of historic Ulster—nine counties instead of the six in Northern Ireland—it was intended that the unionist majority would be slim enough to prevent abuses against the Catholic/nationalist population in the province.\n\nSecondly, the federal parliaments were intended to redress the perceived economic imbalance between the eastern and western parts of Ireland, and was hoped to enable prosperity in the poorer west of the country.\n\nMany members of Sinn Féin, particularly in Northern Ireland, objected to Éire Nua on the grounds that it would perpetuate the dominance of Protestant unionists in the north of the country. Despite this, Éire Nua committees were established at least in Ulster and Connacht, largely due to the efforts of Desmond Fennell and Emmett O'Connell. Nevertheless, the scheme was dismissed as unworkable by some influential Republicans. When Northern Republicans grouped around Gerry Adams gained control of the IRA and Sinn Féin in the late 1970s, they attacked the policy. In 1982, the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis voted to drop the policy, and the following year all reference to it in the Sinn Féin Constitution and rules was removed, and it was removed as the policy of the Republican movement in favour of the creation of a unitary Irish Republic.\n\nÓ Brádaigh and his supporters walked out of the 1986 Ard Fheis after a motion was passed that ended the Republican policy of abstentionism to the Oireachtas and reconvened the Ard Fheis at the West County Hotel in the village of Chapelizod just west of Dublin. Henceforth referring to itself as Republican Sinn Féin to distinguish itself from former associates, the party still advocates the Éire Nua agenda.\n\nThe reaction of the US administration to Éire Nua was mixed. Due in large part to Irish-American pressure at home, a synopsis of Éire Nua was entered into the \"Congressional Record\" as a solution that \"merits consideration\" to the crisis in Ireland. Officials in Ireland were less optimistic, placing more hope in the Sunningdale Agreement. Ambassador John Moore did note, however: \"In long term, some sort of federated Ireland seems a real possibility, but path to it seems more likely to be the pragmatic Sunningdale route than the dramatic one advocated by Boal and the Provos.\"\n\n"}
