It is part of evidence codes based on common law in various countries.\n\nAccording to Lawvibe, \"the 'adverse inference' can be quite damning at trial. Essentially, when plaintiffs try to present evidence on a point essential to their case and can't because the document has been destroyed (by the defendant), the jury can infer that the evidence would have been adverse to (the defendant), and adopt the plaintiff’s reasonable interpretation of what the document would have said...\"\n\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit pointed out in 2004, in a case involving spoliation (destruction) of evidence, that \"the giving of an adverse inference instruction often terminates the litigation in that it is 'too difficult a hurdle' for the spoliating party to overcome. The court therefore concluded that the adverse inference instruction is an 'extreme' sanction that should 'not be given lightly'...\"\n\nThis rule applies not only to evidence destroyed but also to evidence existing but not produced by the party as well as to evidence under a party's control but not produced. See Notice to produce. The adverse inference is based upon the presumption that the party who controls the evidence would have produced it, if it had been supportive.\n\nIt can also apply to a witness known to exist but the party refuses to identify or produce.\n\nAfter a change in the law in 1994, the right to silence under English law was amended because the court and jury were allowed to draw adverse inference from such a silence. Under English law, the police, cautioning someone, say, \"You do not have to say anything. But it may harm your defence if you do not mention, when questioned, something which you later rely on in court\". Under English law, the court and the jury may draw an adverse inference from fact that someone did not mention a defence when given the chance to do so if charged with an offence.\n"}

The decision has widely influenced jurisprudence on vicarious liability outside of Canada.\n\nThe Children's Foundation is a provincially funded, non-profit organization which operated two residential care facilities for children aged six to twelve. In April 1966, the foundation employed Leslie Charles Curry to work in its Vancouver home, where he was hired as a childcare counsellor practising \"total intervention\" in the lives of the children he was caring for. He worked there until March 1980, when the Foundation received a complaint. They investigated and discovered that Curry was in fact a paedophile and had been abusing the children under his care. In 1990 he was charged with 18 counts of gross indecency and two counts of buggery, and was convicted on all but one count, two of those convictions were in relation to the respondent in this case, Patrick Allen Bazley. Curry died not long thereafter. In this case, Bazley sought damages from The Children's Foundation, alleging that they are vicariously liable for the misconduct of its employee.\n\nThe main issue in this appeal was whether or not the Children's Foundation should be held vicariously liable for the actions of its employee. There were two questions before the court: May employers be held vicariously liable for sexual assaults on clients or persons within their care?; If so, should non-profit organizations be exempted from liability as a matter of policy?\n\nThe Supreme Court was cautious to allow vicarious liability to be attached to a non-profit organization. McLachlin J (as she then was) points out that vicarious liability is a form of strict liability, or no-fault liability. The Court was very openly concerned with policy in this decision as vicarious liability can be used by litigants to \"sue into deeper pockets\" even though the litigant may be suing an employer that is not at fault. McLachlin J surveyed a number of possible policy reasons for the imposition of vicarious liability and adopted two of J. G. Fleming's policy rationales:\n\nIn determining if an employer can be found vicariously liable, courts will often use the \"Salmond\" test, which will find an employer liable for the actions of an employee which are:\n\nThe Supreme Court here seems to express frustration at this test. It is possible to view Curry's actions either completely independently, or as a mode of performing an authorized act. The \"Salmond\" test does not give clear criterion for how differentiate these two. As such, the court clarified the test, saying that the court should consider:\n\nThe court went on to explain that vicarious liability is generally appropriate where there is a significant connection between the creation or enhancement of risk and the wrong that flows from the risk. It will not be enough that the wrong took place on company property or through incidental connections.\n\nIn this case, because Curry was left alone for long periods of time unsupervised with his victims, was expected to bathe them and was placed by the foundation in a position of power over them, it can be said that there was a strong connection between what the employer was asking the employee to do and the wrongful act committed. The foundation significantly increased the risk of harm, and as such, should be found vicariously liable for Mr. Curry's actions.\n\nThe Foundation made three arguments that as a non-profit it should not be found vicariously liable\n\nMcLachlin dismissed these arguments as \"crass and unsubstantiated utilitarianism\" and pointed out:\n\nThe appeal was dismissed and the matter was sent back to trial to determine costs.\n\n\n"}

The report was Compiled By Charles C. Royce that covered all decisions and actions around Native American lands nationwide. The full report included an introduction and state by state color coded maps for the entire United States as of the above date.\n\nThe following database is an extraction of all the United State's formal actions between 1851-1892 with California Indians documented by the Bureau of American Ethnology in its Eighteenth annual report to the Smithsonian Institution in 1896.\n\nUpon becoming a state in 1850, California was required by law to allow the United States government conduct all formal relationships with tribal communities. Because of California's previous Mexican government had no formal relationships with the Indians following the 1833 Secularization Act that closed the Spanish era's Catholic Missions, most of the 150,000 surviving tribal people either became servants for the Ranchos of California owners or migrated east to the Sierra Mountains or to the north where they mixed with other non Mission tribes that had been left alone by Mexico.\n\nCalifornia's farmers and gold miners demanded that Indian \"Diggers\" and other aliens be heavily taxed or removed from the gold fields. In 1851, at the same time that the United States was setting up the Public Land Commission as required by the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo with the Republic of Mexico to verify the legality of the Ranchos of California Land Grants given California citizens prior to 1846, the government also setup a commission with military support that resulted in 134 of the state's 300 plus Indian tribes signing 18 treaties that gave away their sovereign rights in exchange for 7.4 million acres of \"reservation\" lands spread across the state.\n\nBetween 1851 and 1865, California carried out the wishes of its citizens: the removal of tribal communities from their ancestral lands by military force across California. The United States went along with these actions, rather than using its resources to stop the state from this period of California Genocide that was legitimized by the 1850 Indian Protection Act and numerous bond and financing actions that went to finance dozens of state militias that hunted down and killed tribal members.\n\nDuring the first years between 1851–52, the state of California's U.S. Senator, John Frémont \nMariposa Brigade rounded up tribal representatives that were living on Senator John Fremont's Mariposa Rancho. Fremont pushed for federal troops and 3 Indian Commissioners that obtained treaty agreements from representatives to abandon their lands in exchange for what would be the first round of reservations for land actions in California. The state, however, refused to even allow these massive land takeaways, resulting in the initial treaties' failure and their existence hidden by a Senate order from the public for over 45 years.\n\nOne of the three appointed commissioners Oliver M. Wozencraft would report that the government's action would lead to a \"war of extermination\" against the state's tribal people on May 31, 1852 but would be relieved of his duties by September of the same year for speaking out, even going public by publishing a pamphlet laying out the impacts.\n\nThs U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs which was originally part of the U.S. War Department would eventually set up four reservations as prescribed by congress that was later followed by tracts of lands ceded to various Mission Indians located mostly in Southern California. In 1896, the Smithsonian Institution produced a report documenting all historic actions by date and tribe of lands taken from or reservations created by the U.S.\n\nLarisa Miller documented how the Northern California Indian Association (NCIA) petitioned President Roosevelt in 1903 to buy federal lands for thousands of homeless Indians across the state because “title and ownership to this beautiful land have never been extinguished.\" Their campaign led to the rediscovery of the 18 Treaties that were signed by 134 bands of Californians and the removal of the senate's order of secrecy on January 18, 1905.\n\nThe United States Bureau of American Ethnology produced annual reports to the Smithsonian Institution on various Native American (First Nation) subjects. In their 18TH annual, two volume report, they published a complete list of all U.S. takings(cessions), treaties and reservations prior to 1896. The report was Compiled By Charles C. Royce, with a 122-page introduction by Cyrus Thomas documenting legal claims for the actions the United States had based its actions on, with a focus on U.S. Supreme Court's 1823 Discovery doctrine decision.\n\nIt was Thomas' following statement that set the tone for the introduction:\n\n\"Its extent afforded an ample field for the ambition and enterprise of all, and the character, low culture-status, and religious beliefs of the aborigines afforded an apology for considering them a people over whom the superior genius of Europe might rightfully claim an ascendancy. The sovereigns of the Old World therefore found no difficulty in convincing themselves that they made ample compensation to the natives by bestowing on them the benefits of civilization and Christianity in exchange for control over them and their country.\"\n\nThe report included color maps for each state with numbered areas (also in color) to identify each cession or reservation that can be used to locate the land on one of the two maps. California had two maps, posted above (Plates CXIV & CXV)\n\nThis is an extraction of the U.S. governments treaties, reservations and land cessions with California's tribal people between 1851-1986.

The Check 21 Act took effect one year later on October 28, 2004. The law allows the recipient of the original paper check to create a digital version of the original check, a process known as check truncation, into an electronic format called a \"substitute check\", thereby eliminating the need for further handling of the physical document. In essence, the recipient bank no longer returns the paper check, but effectively e-mails an image of both sides of the check to the bank it is drawn upon. \n\nConsumers are most likely to see the effects of this act when they notice that certain checks (or images thereof) are no longer being returned to them with their monthly statement, even though other checks are still being returned. Another effect of the law is that it is now legal for anyone to use a computer scanner or mobile phone to capture images of checks and deposit them electronically, a process known as remote deposit.\n\nCheck 21 is not subject to ACH rules, therefore transactions are not subject to NACHA (The Electronic Payments Association) rules, regulations, fees and fines.\n\nThe Act lets banks take advantage of image technologies and electronic transport while not being dependent on other banks being ready to settle transactions with images instead of paper. The process of removing the paper check from its processing flow is called \"check truncation\". In truncation, both sides of the paper check are scanned to produce a digital image. If a paper document is still needed, these images are inserted into specially formatted documents containing a photo-reduced copy of the original checks called a \"substitute check\".\n\nOnce a check is truncated, businesses and banks can work with either the digital image or a print reproduction of it. Images can be exchanged between member banks, savings and loans, credit unions, servicers, clearinghouses, and the Federal Reserve Bank.\n\nThere are a number of patents relating to \"check collection systems\", including some owned by DataTreasury.\n\n\n"}

The program was operated by the Center for Copyright Information, a consortium consisting of the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), and the internet service providers AT&T, Cablevision, Comcast, Time Warner Cable, and Verizon.\n\nThe CAS used a graduated response system (also known as the \"six strikes program\"), in which participating ISPs would send warnings notifying subscribers of alleged copyright infringement, as reported by a monitoring service working on behalf of participating copyright owners. The system specified a six-step progression, from advice messages, to warnings that must be acknowledged by the user. After a fifth warning, ISPs were allowed to implement \"mitigation measures\", which could include penalties such as bandwidth throttling or preventing web access until customers \"discuss the matter\" with their ISP.\n\nThe CAS framework was established on July 7, 2011 after three years in the making. After multiple delays, ISPs began implementing it in late February 2013.\n\nThe CAS discontinued the program on January 30, 2017.\n\nThe Center for Copyright Information employed the services of MarkMonitor (often doing business as DtecNet) to detect and monitor suspected copyright infringement activity. Although MarkMonitor monitored many infringement venues, in early 2013 the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) said it appeared that for purposes of the CAS, the company will only monitor peer-to-peer traffic from public BitTorrent trackers. The Copyright Alert System does not use deep packet inspection.\n\nA review of MarkMonitor's system for the CAS stated that only uploads were monitored, with infringement being suspected when MarkMonitor's BitTorrent client successfully obtains pieces of known-infringing content from a peer in the swarm. The pieces were compared to pieces from an already-downloaded copy of the content, which had already been matched to content samples supplied by the copyright owners.\n\nWhen suspected infringement was detected, the ISP for the IP address associated with the suspicious activity was notified. The ISP, in turn, notified the subscriber to whom the IP address was assigned at the time of the alleged infringement, informing the subscriber that their account was suspected of being used to infringe copyright, and warning of potential consequences. Users who continue to receive warnings could be issued up to six alerts in the form of pop-up messages and e-mails before stronger measures were taken by the ISP.\n\nThe Copyright Alert System was intended to be \n\nThe Center for Copyright Information believed that the Copyright Alert System would be effective in reducing both intentional and unintentional copyright infringement. By providing willing infringers with information regarding the serious consequences of copyright infringement, the CCI hoped to steer would-be infringers to legal online content providers. The CCI hoped that unwitting infringers, such as those whose home networks have been hijacked by unauthorized users or the parents of children who are infringing, would use the knowledge that their account is being used for copyright infringement to force users of the account to curtail these activities. The CCI also hoped to increase parents' involvement in what their children are doing online by alerting misconduct and abuse of their accounts.\n\nThe EFF claimed the materials used to \"educate consumers\" were \"more like propaganda\", and that the framework violated the principle of presumption of innocence.\n\nThe system of alerts was as follows:\n\n\nMitigation measures included: \"temporary reductions of Internet speeds, redirection to a landing page until the subscriber contacts the ISP to discuss the matter or reviews and responds to some educational information about copyright, or other measures (as specified in published policies) that the ISP may deem necessary to help resolve the matter\". Mitigation measures varied by company. Verizon was the first to reveal their mitigation policy. Their policy specified that violators with more than three alerts would be directed to an online copyright law information. Upon a fifth or sixth alert, the user would experience a temporary speed reduction down to 256kbit/s (approximately the speed of dial-up internet access). According to a leaked internal document, AT&T decided that after a 6th alert, a user's \"access to many of the most frequently visited websites [would be] restricted\" until they completed an \"online educational tutorial on copyright\". However, AT&T later explained that it would not cut the user off the internet even though such measure appeared in the copyright warning letter. It gave a reason that the six strikes warnings are only allegations; therefore, if the alleged user was still suspected of illegal downloading after completion of the \"online educational tutorial on copyright\" and the six strikes warnings, unless the copyright owner took legal action; nothing would happen. Time Warner Cable stated that it would not discontinue customers' service, but instead redirect users to educational pages on copyright law upon multiple violations.\n\nThe CCI said that at no point in the process would the ISPs reveal customer information to the CCI, the monitoring service, or the copyright owners.\n\nThe EFF said that because the system \"will not identify those who take steps to anonymize their Internet traffic using a VPN or Tor\" it would not stop dedicated infringers.\n\nThe EFF also argued that the mitigation measures to be undertaken by ISPs in response to alleged copyright infringement were overly harsh, as they could be used to deny consumers access to the Internet, which EFF maintained is as fundamental a right in the digital era as access to other utilities such as electricity. Annemarie Bridy wrote that although temporary suspension was a possible mitigation measure, market pressure would discourage ISPs from using it, instead relying on more educational measures. Mueller, Kuehn, and Santoso attributed the ISPs' adoption of the Copyright Alert System to its voluntary nature and the fact the ISPs were not required to terminate accounts under the Copyright Alert System.\n\nThe CAS process did not allow alerts to be challenged until a mitigation measure was about to be imposed. At that time, the subscriber could request, through a special link provided by their ISP, a special arbitration proceeding. The proceeding would be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA), and the arbitrator would be selected by the AAA. The process was \"automated to the maximum extent practicable\", with the intent of resolving the dispute within thirty days of filing.\n\nThe appeal had to be requested within 14 days of the alert triggering the mitigation measure. The subscriber had to pay a $35 filing fee, unless the fee was waived by the AAA. According to CCI Executive Director Jill Lesser, the $35 fee \"defray[ed] a small part of the cost of the appeal and [was] intended to discourage frivolous appeals\". In order to prevail, the subscriber had to successfully challenge a specified number of alerts (possibly more than one) to block the mitigation measure and receive a refund of the filing fee.\n\nSubscribers could only challenge alerts on one or more of the following pre-defined grounds:\n\nIn an appeal, the burden of proof was on the subscriber to demonstrate the elements of one of the above grounds for challenging an alert.\n\nThe choice of defenses allowed in an appeal was criticized. The defense of unauthorized use of account was not allowed if the user was a member of the subscriber's household or an invitee, and after the first assertion of this defense, the subscriber had to demonstrate by \"clear and convincing evidence\" that the subscriber \"took reasonable steps to secure the account following the first occurrence of unauthorized use\". Bridy wrote that this creates an obligation for subscribers to secure their Internet connection even when they had no legal or contractual obligation to do so. In an \"Ars Technica\" article, Cyrus Farivar said that the responsibility placed on the subscriber by the CAS for copyright infringement that occurred using the subscriber's connection would harm the availability of open Wi-Fi that small businesses make available to their customers. In a CCI blog post, Jill Lesser responded that many businesses with open Wi-Fi had business accounts, which were not subject to the CAS. Lesser also said that businesses offering open Wi-Fi through residential accounts would be subject to the CAS, but those accounts, like others subject to the CAS, would not be subject to termination. The defense of publication before 1923 was the only allowable challenge to the copyright status of a work, even though a work may have been out of copyright protection for other reasons. LaFrance criticized the presence of the \"work published before 1923\" defense but not other factual challenges to the copyright status of the work that she said could just as easily be resolved through the appeal process.\n\nThe subscriber's personal information was not shared with the copyright holder in the appeal process unless the subscriber asserted the defense of authorization and the arbitrator deemed disclosure necessary for the copyright holder to respond to the defense. Bridy favorably compared the privacy of an appeal proceeding to the previous system of \"mass John Doe litigation\". The appeals process involved no hearings and no discovery, although the arbitrator could demand additional information from either party.\n\nThe CCI said that subscribers may also challenge alerts or mitigation measures in court; Bridy presumed that such a challenge could be made in the form of a request for declaratory judgment that the subscriber did not infringe.\nMary LaFrance wrote that the system prevented any party from introducing a decision from the appeal process into any judicial proceeding. According to the CCI, the failure of a subscriber to appeal a copyright alert under the Copyright Alert System \"will not be construed as an admission or waiver in any other proceeding\".\n\nBridy wrote that the copyright law applied in independent reviews would be determined by an expert commissioned by the American Arbitration Association and approved by CCI, who was required to hear \"prevailing legal principles\" of copyright law as viewed by copyright owners. Bridy suggested that the legal standards in an independent review would call into question the fairness of the independent review proceeding, citing what she said were inaccurate statements from the RIAA on copyright. Bridy also said that the lack of written decisions in the independent review process would make it difficult to determine what the rules are for independent review or whether they are being followed.\n\nThe EFF said that the mitigation measures could be imposed without any due process, placing the burden of proof on consumers to show that allegations of copyright infringement are unfounded. The organization recommended that, in the absence of copyright infringement detection systems which have been demonstrated to be entirely accurate, the burden of proof be placed on the content providers to show copyright infringement prior to the mitigation measures. Bridy wrote that IP address collection and content identification methods should be held to a much higher standard (including review by an independent expert with no contractual obligations to the CCI nor non-disclosure obligations), especially since an alert itself could trigger a sanction.\n\nThe EFF argued that the procedure for objecting to an alert was unfairly burdensome to the consumer and biased towards the media companies. Bridy said that because the Copyright Alert System arose from a mass consumer contract, the potential for the repeat-player effect to jeopardize the neutrality of the arbitrators was present. However, Bridy wrote that the independent review process was optional, and users were free to go to court to remove alerts or challenge mitigation measures, unlike in other consumer contracts where arbitration was mandatory. Although Bridy said that few subscribers would go to court owing to the possibility of a large damages award, this alternative allowed for full due process safeguards.\n\nAccording to a May 2014 report by the Center for Copyright Information, from the implementation of the Copyright Alert System through the end of 2013, there were 265 appeals, representing 0.27% of the alerts triggering a mitigation measure for which the appeal process was available. Of the appeals, 47 (17.7%) were successful, the \"vast majority\" of which involved the \"unauthorized use of account\" defense. In none of the appeals was it determined that an account or copyrighted work was misidentified.\n\nThe Copyright Alert System framework was devised by the following companies and organizations:\n\n\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo is credited with helping the parties negotiate and create the Copyright Alert System. In April 2013, IFPI CEO Frances Moore indicated that the role of the United States Government was greater than previously acknowledged in bringing content owners and ISPs together to fight copyright infringement. Specifically she claimed Vice President Joe Biden and \"Copyright Czar\" Victoria Espinel, were critical players in \"pushing the parties to come to some type of agreement\".\n\nThe negotiating parties completed a Memorandum of Understanding in July 2011 and amended it in August 2011 and October 2012. The agreement establishes the framework for the Copyright Alert System, establishing the roles and expectations of the ISPs, the copyright owners, and the monitoring services.\n\nThe Copyright Alert System launched in late February 2013.\n\nThe EFF cited a number of problems with the Memorandum of Understanding. Firstly, the EFF criticized the lack of subscriber representation in the CCI, noting that the establishment of the CCI involved only large media corporations and ISPs, but left out representatives of the subscribers who purchase these companies' products. Further, the CCI only allowed for a three-person advisory board from consumer interest groups, while the executive board is composed of six representatives from the media companies and ISPs, an arrangement which the EFF believed to be inadequate for consumer representation.\n\nThe CCI contracted with Stroz Friedberg, a global digital risk management and investigations firm, to conduct an analysis of MarkMonitor's system for monitoring, verifying, and enforcing online copyright infringement on P2P file sharing networks. Stroz Friedberg assessed the efficacy of MarkMonitor's methodologies to monitor, identify, collect evidence, and generate notices to P2P infringers The contractor published the findings in a confidential report to the CCI in November 2012 (i.e., before the system launched), concluding that the methodologies were \"well developed and robust\", though not without room for improvement.\n\nThe publicly released version of the report contained a number of redactions of various details. Among the report's conclusions were the following claims:\n\nAlthough both the CCI and Stroz Friedberg claimed the review was independent, the CCI didn't release the Stroz Friedberg report until after media reports surfaced that Stroz Friedberg was an RIAA lobbying organization from 2004 to 2009. The firm's sole lobbyist for the RIAA (and, briefly, Universal Music Group) was Beryl A. Howell, the company's executive vice president, executive managing director, and general counsel. Howell was previously involved in crafting numerous pieces of legislation for the investigation and prosecution of computer crime and copyright infringement.\n\nIn response to the \"questions\" raised, the CCI issued a statement reaffirming confidence in Stroz Friedberg's propriety and announcing the public release of the report, but also conceding, \n\nThe CCI also hired Stroz Friedberg to review the accuracy of the system by which ISPs match the IP addresses of suspected infringers to the ISPs' subscribers. The results of that review have not yet been publicly released.\n\nIn August 2013, the CCI announced it had hired Avi Rubin's high-tech litigation consulting firm Harbor Labs to conduct a follow-up review. In March 2014, Harbor Labs completed a limited review of MarkMonitor's system, concluding that the technical design was generally sound, but that the company needs to improve its safeguards against human error and internal malfeasance. The existence of the report was publicly disclosed when the CCI posted the report's executive summary eight months later. The report itself will not be released because it contains confidential information.\n\nThe White House supported the Memorandum of Understanding, calling it \"a positive step and consistent with our strategy of encouraging voluntary efforts to strengthen online intellectual property enforcement and with our broader Internet policy principles, emphasizing privacy, free speech, competition and due process\".\n\nHowever, the CAS was criticized for a perceived lack of public input, perverse incentives between media corporations and ISPs, harsh mitigation measures, and reversal of burden of proof standards. The EFF made particularly detailed criticisms.\n\nIn March 2013, a Freedom of Information Act request related to the White House's role in the policy was denied by a Washington D.C. federal court. Chris Soghoian, a policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), submitted the request to obtain information about the interaction in creating the policy. It was denied in a summary judgement by Judge Royce C. Lamberth. Lamberth's judgement rests on an exemption for drafts and \"...reducing the possibility of misleading the public by disclosing documents that suggest certain reasons for a future decision that do not ultimately bear upon that decision\".\n\nIn 2012, the California ISP Sonic.net CEO told TorrentFreak that his ISP will not be participating in the Copyright Alert System, saying that ISPs are not equipped to police the actions of individuals, and that the MPAA and RIAA have not invited small, independent ISPs to participate. Similarly a representative of Cox Communications told TorrentFreak that they \"have decided not to participate for internal reasons\". Before the CAS' launch, concern existed that data collected for the CAS would be used for more than just the stated \"educational\" purposes. In the first draft of the CCI's Memorandum of Understanding, it was stated that upon that ISPs would be responsible for providing information collected under the CAS program to Content Owners \"if it elects to initiate a legal action against the subscriber\". The final agreed Memorandum of Understanding replaced the term \"legal action\" with \"copyright infringement action\". [footnote 12 – MOU Art 4 g iv.] Two months after the CAS's implementation, Verizon was subpoenaed to provide a third party plaintiff with information on its users which it recorded for CAS purposes. The plaintiff, Malibu Media argued that \"DMCA notices and six strike alerts are relevant because these notices may prove a pattern of infringement and/or notice that infringement is occurring could be used to show a pattern of infringing behaviour\". The Northern District Court of Texas agreed and compelled Verizon to give Malibu Media this information. With this information, Malibu Media was able to successfully litigate the first BitTorrent copyright infringement case in American legal history which concluded with a verdict.\n\nTech law professor Derek Bambauer of the University of Arizona, told Ars Technica that the Copyright Alert System \"is fundamentally flawed\". Bambauer says that injustice could result in the case where a user legally downloaded an entire work under the doctrine of fair use, but the CAS still treated the user as an infringer.\n\nThe EFF said that the CAS will hinder the Open Wireless Movement's goals. Jill Lesser, Executive Director of the Center for Copyright Information, said that the CAS will affect small businesses that use a residential connection for open Wi-Fi: \"Depending on the type of Internet service they subscribe to, very small businesses like a home-office or a local real estate office may have an Internet connection that is similar from a network perspective to a residential connection... The practical result is that if an employee of the small business, or someone using an open Wi-Fi connection at the business, engages in infringing activity the primary account owner would receive alerts\".\n\nAccording to Jill Lesser, the Executive Director of the CCI, the CAS's first year was successful as the CAS is \"intended to be education based\". Lesser indicated that changes for 2014 might include expanding the program to more Internet service providers and also start including other forms of copyrighted media, such as software. In the first year of the CAS's existence, US traffic to The Pirate Bay increased by 31 percent. In June 2013 Warner Brothers Studios began sending warning to users whose internet service was provided by an entity other than one of the five ISP partners of the CCI. In August, Variety revealed that engineers at Comcast and NBC Universal were developing technology designed to recognize the illegal downloading of copyrighted material by its users and launch a pop-up window with links to legal access to such content. This was not a CCI-backed initiative, but rather was viewed as a potential supplement to the CAS as Comcast had begun approaching other content owners and ISPs to explore the concept with them. In the CAS's first year, Comcast, the nation's largest ISP, sent out 625,000 warnings to its users. Largely seen as another supplement to the CAS, in September 2013, AT&T applied for a patent for technology that would allow the company to \"prevent bandwidth abuse\" by tracking the content its users are sharing via BitTorrent and other P2P networks in order to charge its users for excessive bandwidth use.\n\n\n"}

In one sense, it may be rightful steps to protect oneself properly while in a difficult situation, such as what steps to take to protect oneself after being fired. But, in a different sense, according to \"The New York Times\" language expert William Safire, it describes \"the bureaucratic technique of averting future accusations of policy error or wrongdoing by deflecting responsibility in advance\". It often involves diffusing responsibility for one's actions as a form of insurance against possible future negative repercussions. It can denote a type of institutional risk-averse mentality which works against accountability and responsibility, often characterized by excessive paperwork and documentation, which can be harmful to the institution's overall effectiveness. The activity, sometimes seen as instinctive, is generally unnecessary towards accomplishing the goals of the organization, but helpful to protect a particular individual's career within it, and it can be seen as a type of institutional corruption working against individual initiative.\n\nThe phrase \"cover your ass\" is generally viewed as a vulgar term, often replaced by the less-vulgar sounding initials \"CYA\" Safire identified \"CYA\" as a synecdoche, in the same sense that the word \"ass\" had come to reference the whole person. The word \"ass\" in the phrase is often replaced with more polite versions or other euphemisms, such as \"cover your actions\", \"cover your rear end\", or \"cover your butt\", according to Safire. The \"cover your butt\" variant has been used in various ways, such as by Minnesota health authorities urging citizens to undergo preventive colorectal exams, as a way to \"cover\" themselves medically from possible future cancer. In banking, officers tasked with making sure the bank follows proper regulatory procedures, called compliance officers, may realize that certain dubious transactions, such as money laundering and terrorist financing, will occur regardless of any regulatory restrictions; still, to protect themselves and their banks against possible future sanctions, they may engage in CYA activity such as issuing unnecessary memos, obfuscating documents or conducting transactions discreetly, as ways to absolve themselves from possible future liability. The term is widely used in journalism. Safire explained how the term is used in bureaucracy:\n\nBecause these practices are so routine, a genuine warning can be mistaken for CYA behavior, causing a type II error or false-negative error, with disastrous results. For example, in the summer preceding the attacks of 9/11, U.S. president George W. Bush was briefed on a now-famous August 6, 2001, memo titled \"Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in US\". Bush's response to the briefer was reportedly: \"All right. You've covered your ass, now.\"\n\nIn another example, before the launch of the United States spaceship Challenger which ended tragically with the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, the final launch approval by rocket maker Morton Thiokol contained the phrase \"information on this page was prepared to support an oral presentation and cannot be considered complete without the oral discussion\"; this notice was later described as a \"CYA notice\" by information design specialist Edward Tufte. In print, it can have the form of a disclaimer; for example, \"Slate\" magazine suggested that the White House used the phrase \"It is important not to read too much into any one monthly report\" as a disclaimer on reports, and this was described as a CYA activity. The term has been applied in the medical profession to describe doctors who prescribe unnecessary medical tests for patients, to protect themselves against possible future lawsuits. The term has been used to describe a cultural tendency which works against accountability and risk-taking, such as in a war effort when generals engage in much \"cover your ass\" activity which avoids taking real responsibility.\n\n"}

It went into effect on 1 July 1974 and required licenses by the Swedish Data Protection Authority for information systems handling personal data.\n\nInformation and communications technologies (ICTs) were far developed in Sweden due to multiple circumstances and the use of computers in public administration was introduced relatively early. Furthermore, the concepts of transparency, public access and openness were traditionally widely present in Swedish society. Widespread public concern was raised in 1969 due to the year's public census.\n\nIn 1969 the Royal Commission on Publicity and Secrecy was set up to investigate problems associated with the increasing use of computers to store and process personal data and provided the initial analysis, recommendations and drafts. In July 1972 it published its report \"Computers and Privacy\" (Sw. \"Data och integritet\").\n\nThe Data Inspection Board (DIB), proposed in the report, was set up in July 1973.\n\nIn April 1973 the Riksdag uncontentiously passed the Data Act, also proposed in the report, which only slightly modified the commission's draft. It then came into force in July 1973. An associated amendment to the Freedom of the Press Act was adopted in February 1974 − around the same time as the Credit Information Act and the Debt Recovery Acts which regulated computerized credit information.\n\nAs the law's data registration and transborder data flow requirements were considered cumbersome and confusing by private and public organizations and the DIB was soon overcome by the magnitude of registrations the law was amended in 1982 which made the private sector and the government more self-sufficient in terms of registration.\n\nAfter several more amendments in 1989 a Commission on Data Protection was set up to make a total revision of the act. The commission submitted its final report in 1993 recommending a new Data Protection Act based largely on the then current second proposal from the European Commission for an EC Directive. In 1995 Sweden joined the European Union which had adopted the Data Protection Directive in the same year and a new committee was entrusted with making recommendations on the implementation of the directive and a new total revision of the Data Act. In 1997 it presented a report on the implementation containing a proposal for a new Personal Data Act.\n\nThe law was then superseded on 24 October 1998 by the Personal Data Act (Sw. \"Personuppgiftslagen\") that implemented the 1995 EU directive. The 1973 law mainly focused on automated computer processing systems containing assignable information of living persons and not data processing in general and was considered to be outdated in many respects for many years.\n\nThe act required a prior permit from the DIB for each computerised personal data register. When a permit was given, the Board issued tailor-made conditions for that register. It did not contain many provisions on when and how the data should be processed, or general data protection principles.\n\nThose who were subject of data contents were guaranteed freedom of access to their records. Exporting data on Swedish citizens outside the country required a license as well which wasn't granted when it was discovered that this was done to evade the regulatory requirements of the law. In 1979 the Swedish government issued a report which also raised concerns over critical data exported to other countries potentially becoming a target of terrorist organizations.\n\nIt also requires responsible persons to pay compensations when individuals suffer damage due to incorrect information about them.\n\nThe law also criminalized data intrusion but only intended to penalize persons physically breaking into offices to change data and did not consider Internet-based hacking at the time.\n\nIn October 1970 a data protection law went into effect in the West German state of Hesse − the \"Hessisches Datenschutzgesetz\".\n\n"}
{"id": "4418084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4418084", "title": "Demai (Talmud)", "text": "Demai (Talmud)\n\nDemai (, meaning \"agricultural produce about which there is a doubt whether it has been properly tithed\" is the third tractate of \"Seder Zeraim\" (\"Order of Seeds\") of the Mishnah and of the Talmud. It deals with the Jewish legal concept of \"demai\", doubtfully tithed produce, and concerns the laws related to agricultural produce about which it is suspected that certain obligatory tithes have not been properly separated in accordance with requirements specified in the Torah. The tithes in question are \"ma'aser rishon\" (the first tithe, for the Levite), \"terumath ma'aser\" (the Levite's tithe to the kohen), and \"ma'aser sheni\" (the second tithe, for the owner to consume in Jerusalem) or \"ma'aser ani\" (the tithe for the poor), depending on the year of the Sabbatical year cycle.\n\nThe tractate consists of seven chapters and has a Gemara only in the Jerusalem Talmud. There is a Tosefta of eight chapters for this tractate.\n\nThe etymology of the word \"demai\" is uncertain, and it seems that the rabbis of the Talmud were unclear about it. The Amoraim of the second generation (250–290 C.E.) seem to derive it from an Aramaic question meaning \"whether?\" signifying \"is this tithed or not?\" The Jerusalem Talmud connects it to the root \"d-m-y\", in the sense of \"perhaps\" as in \"perhaps he prepared it [the tithe], perhaps he did not prepare it.\" It is possibly a linguistic parallel to the opposite term, \"vadai\", \"certain.\"\n\nOther explanations, cited by Nathan ben Jehiel, the author of the Talmudic lexicon, the Arukh (11th century C.E.) also derive the meaning from Aramaic expressions, such as \"din ma'i\" or \"da ma'i\", meaning \"what is this the law\" or \"what is this?\" in reference to the produce that is subject to tithing. \n\nBenjamin Musaphia, the annotator of the Arukh (17th century C.E.) understands that the word originates from the Greek word \"demos\", people, meaning produce of the \"am ha-aretz\", the ordinary \"people of the land\" about whom there was doubt whether all were sufficiently knowledgeable or careful about observing the laws concerning tithes.\n\nThis tractate concerns the laws regarding agricultural produce about which there is a doubt as to whether the rules relating to the tithes were strictly observed. This doubtfully tithed produce is known as \"demai\".\n\nThe background to the discussions of this tractate is that according to the Torah, Israelite farmers were obligated to separate three types of tithes: \n\nThe Levites also had to contribute from the tithe that they received from the Israelites to the kohanim, consisting of a tenth part of the tithe they had received; it was called \"terumath ma'aser\" (offering from the tithe) or \"ma'aser min ha-ma'aser\" (tithe from the tithe) ().\n\nDuring the period of the Second Temple, doubt began to arise among scrupulous observers of the law (known as \"haverim\") as to whether produce had been properly tithed when they bought from farmers who were likely to be uneducated, or unscrupulous about separating the tithes. This type of individual was known as an \"am ha'aretz\" (person of the land), someone whose trustworthiness was questionable. \n\nThe \"am ha'aretz\" was not suspected of not giving \"terumah\" (gifts to the priests), because it required only a small payment comprising one-hundredth of the produce, and because \"terumah\" had a degree of sanctity that made it a severe transgression for a non-priest to eat. \n\nHowever, because it was doubtful whether the produce of the \"am ha'aretz\" had been tithed, the \"haverim\" who bought grain from them had to designate part of the produce as \"ma'aser\" (a tithe for the Levites or the poor) and \"ma'aser min ha-ma'aser\" (a tenth part of that tithe), albeit in a way that reduced financial loss.\n\nOf general note in this tractate are disputes between the Houses of Shammai and Hillel, the sages from Yavne, as well as material from the generation of Usha contained in this tractate.\n\nOne of the earliest uses of the concept of \"monopoly\" in a commercial sense appears in this tractate, regarding the purchasing of agricultural goods from a dealer who has a monopoly on the produce (chapter 5; 4).\n\nThe Gemara contains a few passages of Aggadah. For example, the conscientiousness of Rabbi Phinehas ben Jair regarding the laws of tithes is described along with other acts of piety for which he was well-known.\n\nThe tractate consists of seven chapters and 53 paragraphs (\"mishnayot\"). It has a Gemara – rabbinical analysis of and commentary on the Mishnah – only in the Jerusalem Talmud; it also has Tosefta.\n\nThere is no Gemara in the Babylonian Talmud for this tractate or indeed for any of the tractates of this order of the Mishna, other than tractate Berakhot, as the laws related to agriculture that they discuss generally have no practical application outside of the Land of Israel.\n\nDemai, with its seven chapters, is an exception to the usual pattern of arranging the tractates in order according to the numbers of their chapters; it appears third in the Mishnah and Jerusalem Talmud, and in most manuscripts of the Tosefta, before tractates with more chapters.\n\nThe Tosefta has a few modifications and additions. It divides Chapter 2 of the Mishna into two parts, and thus has eight chapters instead of the seven of the Mishnah. The eighth paragraph of the sixth chapter of the Mishnah corresponds to the beginning of the eighth chapter of the Tosefta.\n\nAn overview of the topics of the chapters is as follows:\n\nChapter 1 details the cases of products that are exempt from the rules of \"demai\" such as fruit or vegetables which are \"hefker\" (unclaimed or ownerless property).\n\nChapter 2 lists the products to which the rules of \"demai\" apply even outside the Land of Israel if it is bought from an \"am ha’aretz\"; discusses how a person may be certified as a \"ne'eman\" (one who is deemed trustworthy with respect to tithing), or as a \"ḥaver\" who is also trusted on matters of purity; and the duty of merchants regarding tithing \"demai\" produce.\n\nChapter 3 considers the rules for giving or leaving \"demai\" for other people to use and specifies that a \"haver\" must not cause others to consume \"demai\".\n\nChapter 4 considers the rules of eating \"demai\" produce with people who are not trustworthy, and when buying it from them is allowed.\n\nChapter 5 examines the rules about tithing \"demai\" produce bought from several people, and about tithing produce of one kind for produce of another kind.\n\nChapter 6 examines the rules of tithing produce of rented or leased land or trees, of tithing the produce of partners and heirs, of produce sold in lands bordering the Land of Israel, and of produce bought for an \"am ha'aretz\".\n\nChapter 7 considers the rules for the tithing of food consumed with an am \"ha'aretz\", rules of tithing by 'designation', and the rules concerning mixtures and regulations for the tithing of \"demai\" on urgent occasions.\n\nCommentaries on this tractate include the following:\n\nThe Rash Sirilio is the earliest known comprehensive commentary on a large portion of the Jerusalem Talmud is that of Rabbi Shlomo Sirilio (1485–1558). In the Vilna edition of the Jerusalem Talmud it appears only for tractates Berakhot and Pe'ah but the commentary for the entire Seder Zeraim, including tractate Demai, appears in the Mutzal Mi'Eish edition of the Jerusalem Talmud. In addition to his commentary, Rash Sirilio worked to remove mistakes made by manuscript copyists that over time had slipped into the text of the Jerusalem Talmud and his amended text of the Gemara is reproduced alongside his commentary in the Vilna and Mutzal Mi'Eish editions of the Jerusalem Talmud. \n\nMahara Fulda and its companion, Tosefot Maharaf, are the commentaries of Rabbi Eliyahu of Fulda, published in Amsterdam in 1710. Many later commentators refer to him only as \"HaMefareish\" (\"The Commentator\"). \n\nPnei Moshe, the only commentary that covers all of the Jerusalem Talmud completely was written by Rabbi Moshe Margolies, where it was first published in Amsterdam in 1775. \n\nThe Gaon, Rabbi Eliyahu of Vilna also worked to correct many of the textual errors in the text of the Jerusalem Talmud and his rectifications are contained in marginal glosses published under the title Hagahot HaGra. In addition, a work known as Beurei HaGra, was written by his disciples based on his comments. Two versions of this commentary exist, based on manuscripts written by different disciples. \n\nA commentary known as the Ridvaz on nearly all the tractates of the Jerusalem Talmud was first published in Piotrków in 1898, with its companion commentary, Tosefot HaRid, by Rabbi Yaakov Dovid Wilovsky of Slutzk and later of Safed (1845–1914). \n\nIn modern times, two comprehensive works have been published:\nToldot Yitzchak and its companion Tevunah, by Rabbi Yitzchok Isaac Krasilschikov of Poltava, who wrote his commentary in the Soviet Union before he died in Moscow in 1965. The manuscript was smuggled out of Communist Russia by Rabbi Harry Bronstein, who founded Machon Mutzal MeiEish and published a new edition of Seder Zeraim of the Jerusalem Talmud, which included Rabbi Krasilschikov's work and all the major commentators published up to that time. \n\nSha'arei Emunoh, the commentary of Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky to the Jerusalem Talmud has been published to date on Sedarim Zeraim and Moed. It is based on lectures given by Rabbi Kanievsky and contains explanations from earlier commentators, as well as many original insights; the volume on Demai was published in Bnei Brak, Israel, in 2002. \n\nIn addition to the commentaries listed to the above, commentaries specific to tractate Demai, or to the laws of demai are the following:\n\nKaftor VaFerach, by Rabbi Ishtori Haparchi, a disciple of the Rosh, is one of the few surviving compositions of the Rishonim concerning Seder Zeraim. Rabbi Ishtori was born in Provence in about 1280 and emigrated to the Land of Israel, where he absorbed himself in the study of the halachot applying to the Land. His work was first published in Venice in 1546. \n\nMaharam Chaviv by Rabbi Moshe ibn Chaviv of Salonika (17th century) wrote a commentary to the Jerusalem Talmud's tractate Demai, as well as to the Jerusalem Talmud's tractates Berakhot and Peah. This commentary was also named Pnei Moshe, but to distinguish it from the more well-known commentary of that name by Moshe Margolies, it is sometimes referred to as Maharam Chaviv. Extant only as a manuscript from the time of its composition, it was first published by Machon Yerushalayim in 1994. \n\nPe'at HaShulchan is a work on the laws pertaining to agriculture, written by Rabbi Yisroel ben Shmuel of Shklov (1770–1839), a disciple of the Vilna Gaon and first published in Safed in 1836. It contains two sections, the basic laws, which are mostly adopted from Maimonides, and a section of broader discussion called \"Beis Yisrael\". \n\nAruch Ha'Shulchan He'Atid is a compendium of halachot written by Rabbi Yechiel Michel Epstein of Novaradok (1829–1902), who also composed the standard Aruch HaShulchan. It was published posthumously in Jerusalem in 1938 and the first volume deals with the laws of Seder Zeraim. \n\nTorat HaAretz is a work on the agricultural laws, authored by Rabbi Moshe Kliers of Tiberias, published in Jerusalem in 1928 (with a second edition published in 1972). \n\nMikdash David is the work of Rabbi David HaKohen Rappaport (1890–1942), a Torah scholar who perished in the Holocaust and whose work contains a section pertaining to Seder Zeraim. \n\nChazon Ish is a wide-ranging work by Rabbi Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz covering a good part of the Mishnah and Talmud. Chazon Ish's writings on Seder Zeraim in particular have been influential in establishing contemporary halachah in Israel regarding agricultural matters. Chazon Ish's work on Seder Zeraim, including a section on Demai, was originally published in Bnei Brak in 1958. \n\nChidushim U'Veurim of Rabbi Moshe Feinstein is an extensive work on the Jerusalem Talmud's tractate Demai and is published in the Machon Mutzal MeiEish edition of the Jerusalem Talmud. \n\nEretz HaBechirah is a multi-volume work on Seder Zeraim by Rabbi Yosef Tzvi Weiner of Jerusalem; the volume on tractate Demai was published in Jerusalem in 1998. \n\nEmunas Eliezer is a commentary on the Mishna of tractate Demai by Rabbi Eliezer Ephraim Sherwinter, published in Fallsburg, NY in 2007. \n\nMishnas Avraham is a work on various tractates in Seder Zeraim by Rabbi Avraham HaLevi Stewart; the volume on Demai was published in Jerusalem in 2007. \n\nBirkat Yisrael by Rabbi Yisrael Moshe Fried, in collaboration with others, was published in Jerusalem in 2008 as part of a volume containing a critical edition of the Jerusalem Talmud's tractate Demai with commentaries. In addition to its original comments, \"Birkat Yisrael\" cites many earlier works. \n\nKav VeNaki is a commentary as well as a section of insights to tractate Demai co-authored by Rabbi Yehudah Levi and Rabbi Gershon Metzger, published in Jerusalem in 2005. \n\nWorks that are of assistance interpreting the many botanical references in tractate Demai include the following: \n\n\n\nA rabbinic tradition (cited in Mishnah Sotah, Tosefta Sotah, and the Jerusalem Talmud in Sotah and Ma'aser Sheni) indicates that the institution of \"demai\" was in force at the time of the Hasmonean High Priest Yohanan Hyrcanus (135–104 B.C.E.). On the other hand, a \"Baraita\" in the Babylonian Talmud (Sotah 48a), describes Yohanan as the person who instituted \"demai\" upon discovering that most people only separated the priestly \"terumah\" offering and neglected the tithes.\n\nThe contents of this tractate mostly reflect conditions in Judea and the Galilee during the second century C.E. and particularly the conditions in the Galilee after the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–136 C.E.). Most of the Tannaim whose opinions are recorded in this tractate are from this period. \n\nThe tractate contains data about the social life and institutions of the time and the social and commercial relations between the various segments of the population, such as the \"chaver\", the \"am haaretz\", employers and workers, and innkeepers and their guests. The Gemara in the Jerusalem Talmud indicates that there were inspectors who distinguished between produce that was properly tithed (\"metukan\") and the \"demai\", and that there were also officers appointed to watch the sale of articles of food and keep the prices low.\n\nThe Gemara also has considerable information about the produce of the Land of Israel. Many names of fruits and vegetables, in addition to those mentioned in the Mishnah, are cited in the Gemara, along with information about the markets and names of places inside and outside the Land of Israel.\n\n"}

One democratic decision rule is more desirable than another according to that same standard.” In contrast, “procedural democrats” hold that the “aim of democracy is to embody certain procedural virtues…. Democracy is not about tracking any ‘independent truth of the matter’; instead, the goodness or rightness of an outcome is wholly constituted by the fact of its having emerged in some procedurally correct manner” such as through voting or deliberation. Fabienne Peter, for example, offers a conception of epistemic proceduralism that does not depend on a procedure-independent standard for a good outcome. Instead, a decision is legitimate “if it is the outcome of a process that satisfies certain conditions of political and epistemic fairness.”\n\nIn contrast, David Estlund argues that we do not even need a strong justification of “epistemic proceduralism.” Rather, all that is needed is to show why it is better than the alternatives. Estlund argues that pure epistocracies are problematic because there is most likely a “biasing features of the educated group… which do more harm than education does good.” In the US this can be seen in the income and racial inequality that leads to imperfect meritocratic systems that produces those with greater money with the highest education. Estlund uses the case of jury systems to show that original authority can be drawn from an epistemic proceduralist account grounded in normative consent. For him, democracy has no normative authority unless it has a minimal epistemic threshold, which he sets at “better than random” (as in majority rule, better than just 51% of the vote).\n\n"}

The FSA’s mission is to enhance law enforcement through educational and charitable purposes within the state of Florida.\n\nIn 1893, Duval County Sheriff Napoleon B. Broward, who later served as governor of Florida, helped organize the Florida Sheriffs’ Mutual Benefit. In 1910, The Florida Sheriffs' Mutual Benefit Association changed names to become the Florida Sheriffs Association. The FSA served citizens of Florida by enhancing and supporting the needs of Florida’s law-enforcement community. \nSince then, FSA’s development of law enforcement, educational and charitable activities within the state helped transform it into one of the largest state law enforcement agencies in the nation.\n\nFSA provides services such as training, special task forces and legislative and legal services to help improve Florida Sheriffs' Offices and the law-enforcement community. These include:\n\nFSA is managed by a 17-member elected board of directors, all of whom are Sheriffs. The board consists of 12 directors and five officers. To insure statewide representation, active member Sheriffs in each of four divided districts nominate three directors from each district to comprise the 12-member board. The five officers are nominated from any of the four districts.\nThe FSA’s current appointed executive director is Steve Casey.\n\nIn 1957, the FSA founded the Florida Sheriffs Boys Ranch, built to prevent delinquency and help Florida's youth to become lawful, resilient and productive citizens.\nAlthough the project struggled to stay afloat in its first years of operation, it eventually became the Florida Sheriffs Youth Ranches (FSYR) and has expanded to over six different locations throughout the state. The FSYR has provided over 100,000 boys and girls with residential care, camp services and family services.\n\nIn 2006, the FSA developed the Teen Driver Challenge, a road traffic safety program to combat the high crash and fatality rate of teen drivers on Florida highways and state roads. The program is designed around both in-classroom activities and hands-on instructional driving by certified and highly trained law-enforcement officers.\nThe course is currently offered in 35 of the 67 counties in Florida.\n\nIn 2008, the Florida Sheriffs Association launched the Florida Deputy Sheriffs Association, a professional membership association for law enforcement, corrections and support personnel working for Florida Sheriffs’ Offices. The association establishes a forum for knowledge, cohesiveness and authority for all state law enforcement professionals.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20696264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20696264", "title": "Floyd Landis doping case", "text": "Floyd Landis doping case\n\nThe Floyd Landis doping case is a doping scandal that featured Floyd Landis, the initial winner of the 2006 Tour de France. After a meltdown in Stage 16, where he had lost ten minutes, Landis came back in Stage 17, riding solo and passing his whole team. However, a urine sample taken from Landis immediately after his Stage 17 win has twice tested positive for banned synthetic testosterone as well as a ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone nearly three times the limit allowed by World Anti-Doping Agency rules. The International Cycling Union stripped him of his 2006 Tour title. Second place finisher Óscar Pereiro was officially declared the winner. The only previous Tour de France winner to be disqualified was 1904 Tour de France winner Maurice Garin.\n\nLandis was wearing the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification prior to Stage 16, but then lost eight minutes and seemed finished. However, Landis spectacularly came back in Stage 17, winning the stage and cutting his deficit to leader Óscar Pereiro to half a minute. Overtaking him after the Stage 19 time trial, Landis was celebrated as the winner of the 2006 Tour de France.\n\nOn July 27, 2006, four days after the Tour had finished, the Phonak cycling team announced Landis had a urine test come back positive, having an unusually high ratio of the hormone testosterone to the hormone epitestosterone (T/E ratio) after his epic performance in Stage 17. Landis denied having doped and placed faith in a test using his backup sample. Phonak stated that he would be dismissed should the backup sample also test positive. It did, and Landis was suspended from professional cycling and dismissed from his team. Landis's personal physician Arnie Baker later disclosed that his test had found a T/E ratio of first 12:1, later 11:1, far above the maximum allowable ratio of 4:1. The test on Landis's Stage 17 A sample had been performed by the French government's anti-doping clinical laboratory, the National Laboratory for Doping Detection (LNDD), which was a division of the Ministry of Youth, Sport, and Social Life and accredited by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). The B sample confirmed the A sample, and also tested positive for an unnatural source of testosterone.\n\nFollowing the reported positive drug test on his A sample, Landis suggested that the results had been improperly released by the UCI. On August 9, 2006, UCI president Pat McQuaid rejected the claim, saying, \"We acted correctly. We informed the team, the rider, and the federation that there had been an irregularity. Then we issued a press release saying that an unnamed rider had been found positive in the Tour. Landis's team published his name, two days later... I have full faith in that laboratory, and there are stringent measures kept in place by the anti-doping agencies to ensure they proceed correctly.\"\n\nLandis has written a book titled \"Positively False\", which contains his personal account of the case and in which he maintains his innocence.\n\nOn May 14, 2007 an arbitration hearing began between the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) and Landis regarding the doping allegations. On September 20, the arbitrators found Landis guilty of doping.\n\nOn August 1, 2006, \"The New York Times\" reported that, according to a UCI source, Landis's urine test had revealed synthetic testosterone in his body. Despite this, Landis claimed his innocence, promising to \"explain to the world why this is not a doping case, but a natural occurrence\" and that the testosterone in his body was \"natural and produced by my own organism.\" The variety of explanations offered up by Landis provided fodder for many skeptical columns by sports journalists and inspiration for comedians such as David Letterman, who presented the \"Top 10 Floyd Landis Excuses\" on his show. Several experts have refuted Landis's assertions. Landis at first blamed consumption of whisky for his unusual results, an approach that was widely ridiculed. Prof. Christiane Ayotte, director of Montreal's anti-doping laboratory, said that, \"In 25 years of experience of testing testosterone ... such a huge increase in the level of testosterone cannot be expected to come from any natural factors.\" David Black, a forensic toxicologist for Nashville-based Aegis Sciences, said, \"There are not hundreds of plausible explanations. If the tests were so unreliable that there were hundreds of possible reasons, there would be no point in performing the tests.\" Landis later backtracked from some of the assertions, saying, \"The whisky idea was not mine and the dehydration was a theory from the lawyers I hired in Spain to represent me.\"\n\nOn September 8, 2006, Landis's attorney announced that he would formally request that the case be dropped on the grounds that LNDD's 370-page report revealed inconsistencies in the way the samples were handled.\n\nMedia reports said that synthetic testosterone had been detected in the A sample, using the carbon isotope ratio test, CIR, conducted at LNDD. The presence of synthetic testosterone means that some of the testosterone in Landis’s body came from an external source and was not naturally produced by his own system. These results conflicted with Landis's public assertion that it was a natural occurrence.\n\nThe CIR test is used to distinguish between testosterone produced naturally by the athlete's body and synthetic testosterone introduced from an outside source. The test is performed by Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (IRMS). According to Gary I. Wadler, M.D., a member of the World Anti-Doping Agency, the carbon isotope ratio test needs to be done only once, on either an A or on a B sample, particularly if the athlete’s T/E ratio is high as in Landis's case.\n\nIt has been suggested that Landis may have been using testosterone over the long term but was either masking it or diluting it to avoid detection. The positive test result would therefore have been from a mistake with the alleged doping program on one day. Landis gave a total of eight samples during the 2006 Tour. As part of its prosecution, USADA had remaining \"B\" portions of the other samples tested by the LNDD. Four of those samples also showed the presence of synthetic testosterone.\n\nOn September 11, 2006, Landis asked an USADA review board to dismiss the doping charges against him. His request was made on the basis that the A and B urine samples from Stage 17 did not meet the established WADA criteria for a positive doping offense. Landis's lawyer said in a statement: \"The single testosterone/epitestosterone analysis in this case is replete with fundamental, gross errors.\" The lawyer also claimed that the positive finding on the B sample came from a sample number not assigned to Landis. The review board notified Landis on September 18 of its recommendation that USADA proceed with the disciplinary process. Howard Jacobs, attorney for Landis, requested an open hearing by the American Arbitration Association to contest potential sanctions against the athlete.\n\nOn April 14, 2009, the French newspaper \"L'Express\" reported information that had been obtained from hacking into the LNDD was sent to a Canadian counterpart lab from a computer registered to Arnie Baker, Landis' former coach. The French police later invited Landis and Baker to attend a court hearing to answer questions regarding the issue. On July 31, 2009, \"The New York Times\" featured an article on corporate spying in France, stating that, \"No evidence has surfaced to connect Mr. Landis or Dr. Baker to the hacking, and each has denied any involvement.\"\n\nOn September 20, 2007, Landis' doping accusation was upheld by an arbitration panel deciding between him and USADA and Landis was banned for two years. In response to this, International Cycling Union formally stripped him of his 2006 Tour de France title and second-place finisher Óscar Pereiro was officially declared the winner. The only previous Tour de France winner to be disqualified was 1904 Tour de France winner, Maurice Garin.\n\nLandis was also banned from the sport for two years, dated retroactively to January 2007. Even before the USADA's ruling on this matter, the controversy resulted in the disbandment of Landis's former team, Phonak.\n\nLandis agreed not to participate in any racing in France in 2007 to allow him to postpone a hearing of his case there for as long as possible. On December 19, 2007, the French Anti-Doping Agency found him guilty of doping, and issued a two-year suspension, which barred him from racing in France until early 2009.\n\nAfter this verdict, Landis tried to reverse this decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. On June 20, 2008, he lost this appeal. In September 2008 Landis moved in U.S. federal court to vacate the CAS arbitration award, contending that the procurement of the award was tainted by partiality and conflicts of interest. Additionally, Landis contested the $100,000 US \"costs\" award, characterizing it as a disguised punitive award. In December 2008 Landis and the USADA reached a settlement and agreed to withdraw the case with prejudice, leading some to believe that the USADA waived the $100,000 fine in return for the cessation of litigation. Regardless of the reasons for dismissing the case, litigation is now complete and final.\n\nAfter Landis' A sample tested positive for testosterone, retired American cyclist and three-time Tour de France winner Greg LeMond doubted whether additional doping tests would reverse Landis's earlier results. He stated,\n\nFellow professional and 10 time Tour de France cyclist, Australian Stuart O'Grady, left no doubt as to his view in an interview for the Australian 60 Minutes program televised on 22 July 2007. The reporter Liz Hayes asked O'Grady: \"Would anyone have picked that — that the winner of last year's race was a drug cheat?\" O'Grady replied,\n\nOn July 28, 2006, Landis appeared on \"Larry King Live\" to explain his situation and reiterate his innocence. Lance Armstrong, the seven-time and subsequently disgraced former Tour de France winner, phoned the show to express support for Landis, his former teammate. Armstrong expressed skepticism of the French laboratory that conducted Landis's drug test, noting it is the same laboratory involved in some of the doping allegations against him.\n\nArmstrong continuously expressed support for Landis and stated his conviction that the process is biased against athletes.\n\nIn May 2010, Landis admitted to doping, though he continued to deny taking testosterone at the 2006 Tour de France.\n"}

Dawson is an important House of Lords case in the field of UK tax. Its full name is \"Furniss (Inspector of Taxes) v. Dawson D.E.R., Furniss (Inspector of Taxes) v. Dawson G.E., Murdoch (Inspector of Taxes) v. Dawson R.S.\", and its citation is [1984] A.C. 474, or alternatively [1984] 2 W.L.R. 226.\n\nIts effect was to extend the applicability of The Ramsay Principle.\n\nThe most important background to \"Furniss v. Dawson\" was the decision of the House of Lords a few years earlier in \"W. T. Ramsay Ltd. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners\" [1982] A. C. 300. In the Ramsay case, a company which had made a substantial capital gain had entered into a complex and self-cancelling series of transactions which had generated an artificial capital loss. The House of Lords decided that where a transaction has pre-arranged artificial steps which serve no commercial purpose other than to save tax, then the proper approach is to tax the of the transaction as a whole.\n\nThe facts of the case are of less significance than the general principle which arose from it. However, in summary, they are:\n\n\nThe Dawsons argued:\nThe tax authorities argued:\nThe Court of Appeal had given a judgement agreeing with the Dawsons on these points.\n\nThe judgement of the court was given by Lord Brightman. The other four judges (Lord Fraser of Tullybelton, Lord Scarman, Lord Roskill and Lord Bridge of Harwich) gave shorter judgements agreeing with Lord Brightman's more detailed judgement.\n\nThe court decided in favour of the Inland Revenue (as it then was: it is now HM Revenue and Customs).\n\nThe judgement can be viewed as a battle between:\ntwo conflicting ideas which could, at their extremes, be expressed as:\n\nLord Brightman came down firmly in favour of an extension of the Ramsay Principle. He said that the appeal court judge (Oliver L. J.), by finding for the Dawsons and favouring the Westminster rule, had wrongly limited the Ramsay Principle (as it had been expressed by Lord Diplock in a case called IRC v. Burmah Oil Co. Ltd.). Lord Brightman said:\n\nOliver L. J. had given considerable weight to the fact that the existence of Greenjacket Investments Ltd. was real and had enduring consequences. At the end of the transaction, the Dawsons did not own the money which had been paid by Wood Bastow Ltd.: instead, Greenjacket Investments Ltd. owned that money and the Dawsons owned Greenjacket Investments Limited. Legally speaking, those are two very different situations. However Lord Brightman saw this as irrelevant. In any case where a predetermined series of transactions contains steps which are only there for the purpose of avoiding tax, the tax is to be calculated on the effect of the \"composite transaction\" as a whole.\n\n\"Furniss v. Dawson\" has had far-reaching consequences. It applies not only to capital gains tax but to all forms of direct taxation. It also applies in some of the jurisdictions where decisions of the English courts have precedential value.\n"}
{"id": "20816431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20816431", "title": "Gun laws in the Czech Republic", "text": "Gun laws in the Czech Republic\n\nGun laws in the Czech Republic are in many respects less restrictive than elsewhere in the European Union \"(see Gun laws in the European Union)\". A gun in the Czech Republic is available to anybody subject to acquiring a shall issue firearms license. Gun licenses may be obtained in a way similar to a driving license – by passing a gun proficiency exam, medical examination and having a clean criminal record. Unlike in most other European countries, the Czech gun legislation also permits a citizen to carry a concealed weapon for self-defense – 250,000 out of some 300,000 legal gun owners have a concealed carry permit. The vast majority of Czech gun owners possess their firearms for protection, with hunting and sport shooting being less common.\n\nFirearms ownership has a very long tradition in the country. The English term \"pistol\" originated in 15th-century Czech language. \"Mariánská skála\" in Ústí nad Labem is Europe's oldest still open shooting range, established in 1617. The Czech lands have been the manufacturing center (including weapons industry) of Central Europe for over two centuries. Firearms possession was severely restricted during German occupation and the subsequent communist dictatorship, with ownership rates gradually rising ever since return of liberty following the 1989 Velvet Revolution.\n\nUse of firearms as infantry weapons was pioneered in the Czech Crown lands in the early 15th century. In the 1420s and 1430s, the Czech Hussite army led by Žižka started using firearms and artillery effectively on the battlefield (it had previously been used only during sieges of towns and castles due to its heavy weight and cumbersome operation). Use of field artillery in the Battle of Kutná Hora was first such recorded utilization. Firearms, alongside wagon fort strategy, proved indispensable for the mostly peasant reformationist army in their war for religious freedom against professional well armed and trained Catholic Crusader invaders. The word used for one type of hand held firearm used by the Hussites, , later found its way through German and French into English as the term pistol. Name of a cannon used by the Hussites, the , gave rise to the English term, \"howitzer\".\n\nUnder common law tradition, civilians could possess firearms except artillery and insidious weapons (e.g. firearms that had appearance of other objects, etc.). First gun control laws were enacted during the early 18th century and dealt with illegal use of firearms for poaching. At the time, hunting was an exclusive noble privilege with little to no legal option for participation of common folk. Despite tough sentences of 12 years of hard labor or death introduced by a 1727 enactment, poaching with use of firearms remained widespread to the point that a 1732 Royal Gamekeeping Rules noted that gamekeepers were in constant danger of being shot by poachers.\n\nA 1754 enactment introduced up to one year imprisponment for \"carrying\" of daggers and pocket pistols (\"tercerols\") as well as tough sentencing for cases of attacking or resisting law enforcement with use of these weapons. Mere brandishing of a weapon against a state official was to be punished by life imprisonment. Wounding a state official would be punished by decapitation, killing of state official by cutting of hand followed by decapitation. Another 1754 enactment limited possibility of shooting within limits of certain cities to licensed shooting ranges, showing early development of sport shooting in the country.\n\nA 1789 decree on hunting also included firearms related measures. Any person merely passing through someone's hunting grounds was obliged to either strip trigger off or wrap their firearm in cloth under penalty of confiscation as well as complete ban on firearms possession. Other enactments limited use of firearms in cities \"close to buildings\" and on state roads (especially shooting to air during religious celebrations), citing fire hazard as a main concern. In general, however, people were free to possess and carry firearms as they wished, with another 1797 enactment specifying that loaded firearms at home must be kept in a way preventing their use by children.\n\nGun control enactments adopted in the following three decades focused on banning of insidious weapons such as daggers or rifles hidden in walking sticks. Despite having been already banned under the 1727 law, foreword to 1820 enactment lamented their widespread presence among population both within cities as well as in the countryside.\n\nFollowing power reconciliation after failed 1848 revolution, emperor Franz Joseph I enacted the Imperial Regulation No. 223 in 1852. According to the regulation, citizens had the right to possess firearms in a number \"needed for personal use\"; possession of unusually high number of firearms required a special permit. Pistols shorter than 18 centimeters (entire length) were banned altogether as well as rifles disguised as walking sticks. Firearms and ammunition manufacturing was subject to licence acquisition.\n\nThe law also introduced firearm carry permits. A carry permit was available to person with clean criminal record subject to paying a fee. It needed to be renewed after three years. Certain civilians did not need a permit: hunters, shooting range members, those wearing traditional clothing that had firearm as customary accessory. During emergency state, carrying of firearms could have been provisionally prohibited.\n\nAnother regulation of 1857 explicitly banned private ownership of artillery, while 1898 regulation lifted the ban on small pistols (shorter than 18 cm).\n\nAfter the establishment of independent Czechoslovakia in 1918, the country kept the gun law of 1852 (see above), i.e. the citizens had the right to possess firearms and needed to obtain a permit in order to be able to carry them.\n\nAfter Adolf Hitler's rise to power in Germany in 1933, local ethnic German party established its own private security force. In 1938, Hitler brought his demand for succession of part of Czechoslovak borderland that was inhabited mostly by ethnic Germans. The party's security force was transformed into a paramilitary organization called \"Sudetendeutsches Freikorps\" which started conducting terror operations against Czechoslovak state, Jews and ethnic Czechs. Especially snipers using scoped hunting rifles became particular concern. This led to adoption of Act No. 81/1938, on Firearms and Ammunition, which for the first time introduced licensing system not only for carrying of firearms, but also for firearms possession. Ministry of Interior was supposed to enact a regulation which would set rules for obtaining the licenses, however, this has not happened. Freikorps was receiving illegal shipments of firearms from Germany, making the envisioned licensing scheme useless. Thus, despite the new law, the enactment of 1852 still remained in force.\n\nGermany, Poland and Hungary seized Czech borderland following the Munich agreement with UK, France and Italy, in October 1938, immediately putting into force their own restrictive gun laws within the occupied territory.\n\nOn 15 March 1939, Germany invaded the remainder of Czechoslovakia. On the very first day, Chief Commander of German forces ordered surrender of all firearms present within the occupied territory. This pertained not only to civilian owned firearms, but also to those held by the police force. In August 1939, this order was replaced by Regulation of Reich Protector No. 20/39. The regulation again ordered surrender of all firearms and introduced personal responsibility of land plot owners for all firearms that would be found within their property. Reich and Protectorate officials (including police) and SS Members were exempt from the gun ban. Licensed hunters could own up to 5 hunting guns and up to 50 pieces of ammunition. Long rimfire rifles, sport pistols up to 6 mm calibre, air rifles and museum guns were allowed, however they needed to be registered. Simple failure to surrender a firearm carried up to 5 years imprisonment, while hiding of cache of firearms carried death penalty. Offenders were tried in front of German courts.\n\nAnother Regulation of October 1939 ordered surrender of all books on firearms and explosives, as well as all air rifles \"that look like military rifles\", which was obviously aimed at vz.35 training air rifle that had appearance of vz.24 Czechoslovak main battle rifle.\n\nFrom May 1940 onwards, illegal possession of a firearm was punishable by death.\n\nThe 1852 Imperial Regulation became again effective following the defeat of Germany in May 1945 and remained in force until 1950.\n\nIn 1948, Communists conducted a successful coup in Czechoslovakia and started drafting a number of laws that would secure their grip on power, including the Firearms Act No. 162/1949 that became effective in February 1950. The new law introduced licensing for both possession and carrying. License to possess could be obtained from the District National (communist) Committee in case that \"there is no concern of possible misuse\". The same applied for license to carry, for which there was also a specific reason needed. Since 1961, the authority to issue license was given to local police chiefs, subject to the same requirements. Given that state apparatus constantly feared counterrevolution, only those deemed loyal to the party had any chance of getting a license.\n\nMinistry of Interior issued in June 1962 a secret guidance no. 34/1962 which specified conditions under which the police chiefs may have issued a license in accordance with the 1949 enactment. License to possess and carry short firearms may have been issued to named categories of persons (members of government, deputies, party functionaries, communist people's militia members, procurators, judges, etc.). Permit to possess and carry a long hunting rifle may have been issued only to \"certified and reliable persons devoted to the socialist system\". Referencing the secret guidance while issuing or denying the license was strictly forbidden.\n\nA new Firearms Act was adopted in 1983 as No. 147/1983. License remained may issue subject to consideration whether \"public interest\" doesn't prevent firearms possession by the given person. Apart from other formalities, applicant needed to present also declaration from their employer. Licenses were now available for sport shooting purposes, whereby the applicant needed to present recommendation of a local sport shooting society (which was run by the party). For the first time, the applicant also needed to be cleared by his general practitioner. Licenses were issued for a period of 3 years subject to renewal. Similarly as before, the enactment was accompanied by secret guidance of the Ministry of Interior No. 5/1984. The guidance again limited access to firearms to selected classes, mainly Communist Party members. Newly, sport shooters that achieved required performance bracket could also obtain license. Possession of hunting shotguns was less restrictive.\n\nFollowing the Velvet Revolution, an amendment act No. 49/1990 Coll. was adopted. Under the new law, any person older than 18, with clean criminal record, physically and mentally sound that did not pose threat of misuse of the firearm could have license issued. License may have been issued for purpose of hunting, sport shooting, exercise of profession and in special cases also for protection (concealed carry). Newly, denial of license could be challenged in court. Even though the law remained may issue, practice of issuing licenses became permissive.\n\nA general overhaul of the gun laws took place through act No. 288/1995 Coll. Under the new act, gun license became shall issue. Also possession and concealed carry of pistols and revolvers became shall issue. The law further introduced mandatory firearms registration.\n\nAccession to EU required a new law compliant with the European Firearms Directive, which was passed in 2002. The law significantly liberalized gun ownership, for example by allowing any legal weapon to be owned for self-defense and legalizing semiautomatic firearms which look like automatic, despite introducing more EU required regulation.\n\nCornerstones of current Czech gun law remain the same since the 1990s: precisely defined requirements that an applicant must meet in order to be granted a license. Once a person obtains the necessary license, the law is relatively permissive as regards both the type of firearms that become legally accessible, as well as possibility of their concealed carry for personal protection. At the same time, the issuing authority (police) firearm owners' database is connected to information needed for a background check and red flags any incidents that may lead to loss of license requirements. Similarly, health clearance by the general practitioner is needed for periodical renewal of license (every ten years).\n\nUnder Act No. 119/2002 Coll. every citizen that meets the act's conditions has the right to have firearms license issued and can then obtain a firearm. Holders of \"D\" (exercise of profession) and \"E\" (self-defense) licenses, which are also shall-issue, can carry up to two concealed firearms for protection.\n\nThere are five categories of gun license; however, these should not be mistaken with the categories for guns.\n\nAn applicant applies for a gun license at a designated local office of the National police. If the conditions of age, qualification, health clearance, criminal integrity and personal reliability are met and a fee of 700 CZK (US$ ) per category is paid, the license shall be issued in thirty days. The license must be renewed every ten years (no need to undergo qualification exam if the application is filed at least two months before termination of the previous license; health clearance still necessary).\n\nTo obtain a B or C category license, the applicant must be at least 18 years old. Under special circumstances, the applicant need only be 15 if a member of a sporting club, or 16 if taught hunting in schools with such a curriculum. To obtain an A, D or E category license, the applicant must be 21.\n\nObtaining the license requires passing a theoretical and practical exam.\n\nA person can obtain more or all of the categories at once. But the set of categories needs to be known before the exam and highest score needs to be met. Typically, people obtain E and B category because these two categories provides the best versatility (almost any firearm can be owned and carried concealed). The D category is required by the law for the members of the municipal police (members of the state police do not need license for on duty firearms) and does not itself permit private gun ownership (unless the person obtains also other license category).\n\nApplicant (license holder) must be cleared by his general practitioner as being fit to possess, carry and use a firearm. The health check includes probes into the applicant's anamnesis (i.e. medical history) and a complete physical screening (including eyesight, hearing, balance). The doctor may request examination by a specialist in case he deems it necessary to exclude illnesses or handicaps stated in the respective governmental regulation. Specialist medical examination is obligatory in case of illnesses and handicaps that restrict the ability to drive a car.\n\nGovernmental Regulation No. 493/2002 Coll. divides the listed illnesses and handicaps into four groups, covering various issues from psychological and psychiatrical to eyesight and hearing (for example, the applicant must be able to hear casual speech over distance of 6 meters to be cleared for the \"E\" category). Generally, the regulation is more permissive when it comes to the license categories \"A\" and \"B\", and more strict with view to the other categories, listing which illnesses and handicaps may curtail or outright prevent positive clearance by the general practitioner. The outcome of the medical examination may be either full clearance, denial, or conditional clearance that lists obligatory health accessories (glasses, hearing aid, etc.) or sets obligatory escort when armed (e.g. \"B\" – sport shooters with minor psychological issues, or with addiction habits cured more than three years prior to the health check).\nThe enactment specifies the amount of time which must elapse after a person is released from prison for serving time for particular groups of crimes. Ex-convicts punished for committing selected crimes, such as public endangerment, or participation in organized crime group or murder, if sentenced to more than 12 years imprisonment, may never fulfill this condition. There is a central registry of criminal offenses in the Czech Republic. The criminal integrity is reviewed notwithstanding any possible expungement of the records for other purposes.\n\nConditional discharge does not count, only the original sentence.\n\nPolice may order temporary seizure of firearm license and firearms in case that the holder is charged with any intentional crime, or a negligent crime connected with breach of duties relating to possession, carrying or use of firearms or ammunition.\n\nA person who verifiably excessively drinks alcohol or uses illegal drugs, as well who was repeatedly found guilty of specified misdemeanors (e.g. related to firearms, DUI, public order, etc.) in the preceding three years, is considered unreliable for the purposes of issuing a gun license. The police has the right to inquire information regarding these issues also from municipal authorities (misdemeanors are dealt with by municipal authorities and there is no central registry related to them).\n\nLosing reliability is caused by:\n\nPolice may order temporary seizure of firearm license and firearms in case that administrative proceedings against the holder are initiated for committing selected misdemeanors (e.g. carrying while intoxicated, refusing to undergo intoxication test while armed, shooting outside licensed range unless in self-defense).\n\nThe law distinguishes foreigners according to their country of origin. For selected foreigners, a license is shall-issue as same as for Czech citizens, while for others it is a may-issue.\n\nForeign born residents are treated equally in the eye of Czech law (see above), but proof of a lack of criminal record in their country of origin must be provided; persons having residence also in another EU country must provide documentation showing that they are allowed to own a firearm therein. All the documents must be translated into Czech language by a sworn translator.\n\nForeigners with registered place of residence in the Czech Republic may purchase firearms after obtaining corresponding licenses and permits; persons having residence also in another EU country must provide documentation showing that they are allowed to own such a firearm therein in order to be granted a permit to purchase a B category gun.\n\nThe written test as well as the practical exam has to be taken in the Czech language. Until 31 December 2011, test-takers were allowed to use a sworn interpreter/translator, but this has since been forbidden.\n\nUnder the current gun law, guns, ammunition and some accessories are divided into four categories (these should not be mistaken with categories of licenses):\n\nA – Restricted firearms and accessories\n\nB – Guns requiring permit\n\nC – Guns requiring registration\n\nD – Guns available to adults above 18\n\nA person must obtain the Gun License (Zbrojní průkaz) to be allowed to own gun of categories A, B and C. To own a gun in the D category only the age of 18 is required. A, B and C category weapon has to be registered within 10 working day with the police after it is bought.\n\nEach of the A, B, C and E categories of gun license allows the person to buy a B or C category of gun. Holders of an A category license may, after being granted may-issue exemption by the police, also purchase an A category firearm; holders of D category may possess and carry any category of firearm (which remains the property of the employer).\n\nIn case of B license the person is allowed to use their guns at shooting ranges. The C license is required by other laws for hunting. The E license allows the person to own a gun for self-defense purpose and carry the concealed weapon. All guns need to be registered with the police in 10 working days after buying except for the D category.\n\n\nThere is no limit in the law on number of owned guns. The law specifies safe storage requirements for those owning more than two weapons or more than 500 rounds of ammunition. The safe storage requirements are further exacerbated for those owning more than 10 and more than 20 firearms.\n\nPossession of a firearm that does not belong to category D without a gun license (as well as sale, manufacturing, procurment, etc.) is a criminal offense which carries a penalty of up to two years imprisonment (up to eight years in defined cases).\n\nFirearm owners are allowed to practice only at licensed shooting ranges and may otherwise use the firearm only in case of self-defense, or when permitted by other laws (e.g. hunting). As of 2014, there are almost two hundred places opened for the public. Any adult can visit such a range and shoot from available weapons, without restrictions or permits. A person without a gun license has to be supervised (if younger than 18, then by a person at least 21 years old who has been a holder of a gun license for at least 3 years).\n\nHolders of different categories of firearms licenses have different possibility of carrying their firearms. In general, it is prohibited to carry firearms to court buildings (they may be left for safe keeping with the judicial guard upon entry before passing through metal detector), at demonstrations or mass meetings. It is also generally considered irresponsible to take guns to clubs or bars even though it is not explicitly prohibited by law. Carrying a gun while intoxicated is, however, illegal and can lead to heavy fines and losing the gun license, with police frequently conducting intoxication tests of open-carrying hunters. Carrying guns in schools and campuses is not prohibited by law and there are no so called \"gun-free zones\".\n\nThe Czech Republic is a relatively safe country: Prague, with the highest crime rate in the country, still ranks as one of the safest capitals in the European Union. Considering the number of E category licenses issued, there are about 240,000 people who could potentially carry a firearm; however, it is not clear how many regularly do so.\n\n\nAll of the high-penetrating (armor-piercing) and hollow-point ammunition is classified as category A (see above). The alternative to a hollow point ammunition was Federal EFMJ, which has been classified into the arms group A in mid 2009, effectively outlawing it. Therefore, only full metal jacket or soft-nosed semi-jacketed rounds and or just unjacketed bullets (lead only) are allowed. Generally, no ammunition with higher wounding potential is allowed.\n\nThere is currently no restriction on caliber size and no restriction on magazine capacity. However, special safe storage requirements apply for those having more than 500, 10,000 and 20,000 bullets.\n\nGun licences equivalent for legal persons, such as shooting ranges or private security companies. Divided into 11 categories.\n\nThere are no specific legal provisions covering self-defense by a civilian using a firearm. The general provision regarding criminal aspects of self-defense are contained in the Section 29 (\"Necessary self defense\") of the Criminal Code. General provisions regarding civil liability in respect of self-defense are contained in the Section 14 of the Civil Code.\n\nIn general, Czech penal theory recognizes certain classes of circumstances where criminal & civil liability will be excluded in respect of actions which would normally attract a criminal penalty. These include \"utmost necessity\", \"necessary self defense\" and other cases involving \"eligible use of a gun\".\n\nUtmost necessity may be invoked where an interest protected by the Criminal Code (such as right to property or right to life) is endangered. An example of necessity would be a defense against a raging dog (unless the dog was directly sent by the owner, which would be case of necessary defense). The necessity may be invoked only in case of imminent danger and only if there is no other way of avoiding it (\"subsidiarity\"), such as locking oneself behind a fence or calling the police. Also, the consequence of the necessity must be less serious than the consequence of the endangering act (\"proportionality\").\n\nNecessity is excluded in cases where:\n\nThe basis of necessary self-defense is deflection of an \"imminent\" or \"ongoing\" attack against an interest covered by the Criminal Code (such as right to property or right to life) by performing an action which would otherwise be punishable (such as use of a firearm against the other person). The imminent part means that a party is evidently and immediately threatened, it is not necessary to wait for the attacker to start the attack, especially if he is known for his aggressiveness. (That, however, is not the case if the attack is being prepared, but not imminent). The necessary self-defense may also be enacted when defending someone else's interest (i.e. defending their person or their property) as long as the same requirements are met. However, defending against a provoked attack is not considered \"necessary self defense\".\n\nThere is no requirement of subsidiarity: in this respect \"necessary self defense\" differs from \"utmost necessity\". The main limitation is that the defense may not be manifestly disproportionate to the \"manner of the attack\". The manner of the attack is not the same as its intensity, which is only a part of it. For example, \"intensity\" covers whether the attack is committed by a single attacker or a group, with or without a gun, and the relative strength of the attacker and the party attacked, etc. But the manner also includes future imminent dangers, such as the possibility that single attacker might imminently be joined by others.\n\nAs regards proportionality, the law states that a self-defense may not be \"manifestly disproportionate\". It is evident, that for a self-defense to be successful, it has to be performed on a level exceeding the attack. Unlike in case of necessity, the consequence of necessary self-defense may be more serious than consequence of the attack. The defense may not be restricted to a passive one, it can also be active. It is not the outcome of the incident but the sequence of actions at its beginning which determines who is to be deemed the attacker, and who is the party attacked.\n\nThere are two main excesses, which are not recognized as necessary self-defense:\n\nEligible use of a gun is addressed in special enactments dealing with police, secret security service, prison guards etc. Thus for example a policeman may, under specified conditions, shoot on an escaping suspect, a privilege which an armed civilian does not have.\n\nIt is acceptable to defend from a violent attack anywhere on the street especially when a person is attacked with a knife or another deadly weapon. Shooting an unarmed attacker also occurs and becomes sometimes a subject of controversy. In general, each case is investigated in great detail before being eventually dismissed as a legitimate self-defense. The defense is judged according to the subjective and objective perception of the defender during the time of the imminent or ongoing attack, and not according to the view of persons who are judging it ex post.\n\nThe American style Castle Doctrine is also not applied however it is usually considered acceptable to defend from a \"violent\" home invasion with a firearm. In 2014, an amendment of laws concerning self-defense was proposed with the aim of giving greater leeway to defenders, especially in cases when they would not normally meet the bar for legitimate self-defense under the current legislation, but face extraordinary circumstances, such as confusion as a consequence of the attack, or when facing home invasion.\n\nAlthough there is no stand-your-ground law, the fact that necessary defense (unlike utmost necessity) is not subject to subsidiarity means that there is also no duty to retreat. The mere fact that a defender uses a weapon against unarmed attacker does not mean that the defense is disproportionate (and thus not legitimate) to the manner of the attack and the proportionality of defense does not depend on the relative effectiveness of the defender's weapon compared to the intensity of the attack, but on the manner in which the weapon is used (aiming at leg, i.e. intended non-deadly defense, may be proportionate where aiming at chest may be manifestly disproportionate, notwithstanding if the slug hits a leg artery and the attacker bleeds to death).\n\nThe fact that a person prepares a weapon in order to defend themselves against expected attack does not preclude the defense from being legitimate and, according to courts, it may not be expected from a defender to wait and rely on chance that a damage which is, both objectively and in the defender's subjective understanding, threatened to happen, will not take place. The defender may use \"proportionate\" accessible means in order to prevent an imminent attack and disarm the attacker.<ref name=\"3 Tdo 1197/2013\"></ref>\n\nA number of successful defensive uses of firearms or other weapon is being cleared as legitimate self-defense by authorities every year without raising wider public concern, including for example a 2014 shooting of an attacker by a bartender in Hořovice, or a 2014 shooting of an aggressive burglar in a garage by homeowner in Čimice. However, some cases become rather notable, such as:\n\nGiven that firearms possession was banned during German Nazi occupation and then allowed only to those deemed loyal during the Communist regime, the right to be armed is seen as one of attributes of liberty in the country. Together with rapid rise of criminality involving illegal firearms following the Velvet Revolution, this led to fast rise in legal firearms ownership in the country in the 1990s. By 2001, some 3% of population possessed firearms licenses. The number of license holders was falling slightly from this point (faster as regards C licenses, while E licenses remained mostly level) until the 2015 EU Gun Ban Proposal, from which point the number of license holders began to rise again (mostly E licenses). The police recorded a tripling of average monthly applications for firearms licenses by the end of 2015 compared to the beginning of that year.\n\nWhile the number of license holders started to rise gradually, firearm sales rose even faster in 2015, mostly prompted by the EU efforts to restrict law abiding citizens' access to firearms. Average annual rise in the number of registered firearms amounted to 14,500 guns between 2006 and 2014, there were 54,508 new registered firearms in 2015 alone. Local tendencies generally follow the nationwide trend, however any worsening of security in any given district is often followed by a sharp rise in gun ownership therein. For example, in 2011, after a wave of racially motivated attacks by Romani perpetrators against majority population victims, there was a rise of gun ownership in Šluknov Hook area.\n\n240,000 out of 300,000 (2016) gun owners have self-defense licenses, which permit them to carry concealed firearms for protection (any B or C category firearm, not only pistols). Following a wave of terror attacks around Europe, a number of politicians as well as security professionals started urging gun owners to actually carry firearms in order to be able to contribute to soft targets protection. These included, among many others, the President Miloš Zeman, whose own wife obtained E license and a revolver, as well as Libor Lochman, Chief of URNA, the country's main special forces anti-terrorism unit. While there are no statistics as regards how many E license holder actually do carry firearms in general, there are places known for high concealed carry rate, such as Prague Jewish Quarter.\n\nUnlike elsewhere in Europe, there is a relatively high proportion of semi-automatic firearms in the country, which are generally considered better suited for self-defense. The most owned firearms in the country are CZ 75 Compact and Glock 17. Other popular guns include 1911 clones and semi-automatic rifles made by Czech manufacturers, especially vz. 58 and AR-15 (of which there are 3 manufacturers). There are relatively fewer revolvers, mostly from US manufacturers such as Smith & Wesson and Colt, or Czech producers ALFA and Kora.\n\nIt is generally not common for licensed gun owners to commit violent crimes with their guns, and most of the gun crimes are committed with illegal weapons that are beyond the control of the law. Annually, police investigate about 500 cases of illegal arming (with or without direct connection to committing other crime).\n\nPolice recorded 45 violent crimes (most of them, 17, being \"dangerous threats\" and 9 homicides, mostly intra-family) being committed with legal firearms (A,B,C category) in 2016, down from 71 in 2014 and 51 in 2015 respectively. Meanwhile, illegally possessed firearms (A,B,C category) were used in 71 violent crimes (9 murders) in 2016. When resorting to use of firearms, perpetrators mostly utilize non-lethal free-to-buy D category weapons (see above) that resemble real guns, with 906 such crimes taking place in 2016. Apart from simple threats, the most common crime committed with firearms is robbery. Out of 1.500 robberies recorded in 2016, 153 took place with use of D category free-to-buy non-lethal weapons, 24 with illegally possessed firearms and 3 with legally possessed firearms (out of over 800,000 legally owned firearms).\n\nOccasionally, crimes with legally owned guns do happen. The most notable examples include:\n\nThe gun law in the Czech Republic is quite liberal. It is mostly caused by the fact that after the fall of communist regime people wanted to regain their rights to keep and bear arms and these needs resulted in passing quite liberal legislation in 1995, which surpassed the previous restrictive communist enactment. The law became widely accepted and led to quite massive civilian arming. Especially many businessmen felt the actual need to obtain a firearm because the times shortly after the Velvet Revolution are known for the rise in organized crime often related to the economic transformation in the early 1990s.\n\nThe biggest attempt on restricting firearm ownership happened in 1999, Minister of the interior Václav Grulich proposed a new law, compliant with the EU requirements, which would severely restrict gun ownership by requiring the membership in a sports club for sports license and proof of \"danger to life\" for concealed carry permit and self-defense gun ownership. However, the proposal sparked opposition in the Chamber of deputies, the main concern being immense corruption potential in the proposed \"may issue\" doctrine, and the proposal was rejected by all parties in the chamber, except for Social Democrats, the party of Grulich himself. 5 years earlier, a similar motion was proposed by Zdeněk Trojan, a deputy for ČSSD, in a form of amendment to a government proposed firearms act (the one that was enacted in 1995) but found very little support and was rejected.\n\nDue to falling crime rates, fewer people felt the need to carry a firearm for protection after 2000. This trend however changed in 2015 following the European migrant crisis and November 2015 Paris attacks. Gun advocacy groups argue that there is no point in banning guns because criminals will get guns no matter how tight the law is. At the same time, however, the rules are deemed to be restrictive enough to prevent criminals from easily obtaining firearms, while allowing upstanding citizens to own them for personal protection. For example, in 2010, a Norwegian terrorist, incited by reports of British newspapers describing Prague as \"being the most important transit site point for illicit weapons in Europe\", found himself unable to obtain any in the country when preparing for the 2011 Norway attacks. Similarly, a Polish terrorist obtained guns illegally in 1200 km distant Belgium, despite living mere 70 km from the Czech border. Also, the fact that Czech Republic has a strong tradition in firearms manufacturing and competition shooting contributes to generally moderate attitude to gun control.\n\nObligatory psychological testing for gun owners is a common subject of discussion, but it has always been rejected. Gun advocates point out that the nature of the tests and the parties responsible for them are not clear. It is also pointed out that it is unlikely that any psychological testing would reveal a potentially dangerous individual, because some famous killers in the past were members of the military or the law enforcement and passed very difficult psychological testing successfully.\n\nThe most important changes to the 2002 Firearms Act were the following:\nAbout a fifth of members of the Czech Parliament are holders of gun license; some of them are believed to conceal carry also within the parliament grounds (parliamentarians are not required to pass gun check on entry unlike other staff or visitors).\n\nGenerally, firearms possession is not a politicized issue that would be debated during Czech elections. The 2014 European Parliament election became an exception in connection with the Swedish European Commissioner Cecilia Malmström's initiative to introduce new common EU rules that would significantly restrict the possibilities of legally owning firearms.\n\nIn connection with that, a Czech gun owners association asked the parties running in the elections in the Czech Republic whether they agree (1) that the citizens should have the right to own and carry firearms, (2) that the competence on deciding firearms issues should lie in the hands of the nation states and not be decided on the EU level, and (3) whether they support Malmström's activity leading to the curbing of the right of upstanding citizens to own and carry firearms. Out of 39 parties running, 22 answered. The answers were almost unanimously positive to the first two questions and negative to the third one. Exceptions were only two fringe parties, the Greens – which, while supporting the right for gun ownership in its current form, also support further unification of rules on the European level and labeled the opposing reaction to Malmström's proposal as premature, and the Pirates which support unification of the rules leading to less restrictions elsewhere, commenting that one may not cross the borders out of the Czech Republic legally even with a pepper spray. Other fringe parties at the same time voiced their intent to introduce American style castle doctrine or to arm the general population following the example of the Swiss militia.\n\nThe European Commission proposed a package of measures aimed to \"make it more difficult to acquire firearms in the European Union\" on 18 November 2015. President Juncker introduced the aim of amending the European Firearms Directive as a Commission's reaction to a previous wave of Islamist terror attacks in several EU cities. The main aim of the Commission proposal rested in banning B7 firearms (and objects that look alike), even though no such firearm has previously been used during commitment of a terror attack in EU (of 31 terror attacks, 9 were committed with guns, the other 22 with explosives or other means. Of these 9, 8 cases made use of either illegally smuggled or illegally refurbished deactivated firearms while during the 2015 Copenhagen shootings a military rifle stolen from the army was used.)\n\nThe proposal, which became widely known as the \"EU Gun Ban\", would in effect ban most legally owned firearms in the Czech Republic, was met with rejection:\n\nMinistry of Interior published in May 2016 its Impact Assessment Analysis on the proposed revision of directive No. 91/477/EEC. According to the Ministry, the main impacts of the proposal, if passed, would be:\n\nDespite reservations of the Czech Republic and Poland, the Directive was adopted by majority vote of the European Council and by first reading vote with no public debate in the European Parliament. It was published in the Official Journal under No. (EU) 2017/853 on 17 May 2017. Member States will have 15 months to implement the Directive into its national legal systems. The Czech Government announced that it will lodge a suit against the directive in front of the European Court of Justice, seeking postponement of its effectiveness as well as complete invalidation, and did so on 9 August 2017.\n\nMinistry of Interior proposed a constitutional amendment on 15 December 2016 aimed at providing constitutional right to acquire, possess and carry firearms. The proposed law would, if passed, add a new section to Constitutional Act No. 110/1998 Col., on Security of the Czech Republic, expressly providing the right to be armed as part of citizen's duty of participation in provision of internal order, security and democratic order.\n\nAccording to explanatory note to the proposal, it aims at utilisation of already existing specific conditions as regards firearms ownership in the Czech Republic (2.75% of adult population having concealed carry license) for security purposes as a reaction to current threats – especially isolated attacks against soft targets. While there is constitutional right to self-defense, its practical utilization without any weapon is only illusory.\n\nThe note further elaborates that unlike the rest of the EU, where most guns are owned for hunting, the vast majority of Czech gun owners possess firearms suitable for protection of life, health and property, explicitly mentioning, inter alia, semi-automatic rifles (which are subject to the proposed EU Gun Ban, see above).\n\nAs regards adherence to EU law, the explanatory note states:\n\nThe Minister of Interior Milan Chovanec stated that he aims, due to pressing security threats, at having the proposal enacted before the autumn 2017 Czech Parliamentary Elections. The right to be armed further became a major political issue with explicit impact as regards possible future Czech-EU relationship and membership, when the Civic Democratic Party took a pledge to \"defend the right of law abiding citizens to be armed even if it would mean facing EU sanctions.\"\n\nOn 6 February 2017, Minister Chovanec and 35 other Members of Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Parliament officially lodged proposal of the constitutional amendment with modified wording. In order to pass, the proposal must gain support of 3/5 of all Members of Chamber of Deputies (120 out of 200) and 3/5 of Senators present. Explanatory note to the proposal states that it aims at preventing significant negative impacts of proposed EU Firearms Directive amendment that would lead to transition of now legal firearms to black market. It aims to utilize to the maximum possible extent both exemptions of the Directive proposal as well as the sole authority of national law provided in the EU's primary law for issues of national security The legislative process continued as follows:\n\nThe proposal is expected to be submitted again in Parliament after the 2018 autumn Senate elections, which ended with a decisive victory for ODS, a conservative party in favor of the amendment.\n\nThere is currently no regulation on other type of weapons such as knives, pepper sprays, batons or electrical paralyzers. These items can be freely bought and carried. Similarly as in the case of firearms, it is prohibited to carry these weapons to court buildings, demonstrations and mass meetings. The Ministry of the Interior officially recommends carrying non-lethal weapons such as pepper sprays, paralyzers, or gas pistols as means of self-defense\n\nThe Czech penal code defines \"weapon\" as \"anything that may make an attack against the person more severe\". Although there are no restrictions on possession and carrying of weapons, their use in commission of a crime is punishable by stiffer sentences. For example, blackmail carries six months to four years imprisonment, but blackmail with a weapon carries four to eight years imprisonment.\n"}
{"id": "33186925", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33186925", "title": "Harmony with nature", "text": "Harmony with nature\n\nIn participation with the United Nations Earth Summit 2012 the Bolivian government submitted a proposal titled 'Harmony With Nature' this proposal attempts to define a platform for global sustainable development.\n\nThe General Assembly of the United Nations approved by consensus two resolutions presented by Bolivia. The first, entitled “Harmony with Nature,” asks to convene an interactive dialogue on International Mother Earth Day on April 22, 2011. Topics will include methods for promoting a holistic approach to harmony with nature, and an exchange of national experiences regarding criteria and indicators to measure sustainable development in harmony with nature.\n\nThis resolution recognizes that “human beings are an inseparable part of nature, and that they cannot damage it without severely damaging themselves.” It also seeks to contribute to the preparatory process for the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in 2012.\n\nThe proposal in its entirety, verbatim, follows.\n\nPreliminary Proposal of the Plurinational State of Bolivia for the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20)\n\nThe achievement of sustainable development in the 21st Century requires a Social and Ecological Contract among human beings and our Mother Earth that brings together and builds upon the progress made in the World Charter for Nature (1982), the Rio Declaration (1992), the Earth Charter (2000), and the World People’s Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth (2010).\n\nIt would include the following premises:\n\nI. WE ARE BREAKING THE BALANCE OF THE EARTH SYSTEM\n\n1. Twenty years after the “Rio Declaration,” it is necessary to update its First Principle such that it would state: “Human beings and nature are at the center of concerns for sustainable development.” It is essential to get beyond this anthropocentric vision. Not only do human beings “have the right to a healthy life,” but so too does nature, which is the basis of survival for all species including humans.\n\n2. Nature is not just a set of resources that can be exploited, modified, altered, privatized, commercialized and transformed without any consequences. Earth is the only home we have. The Earth does not belong to us; we belong to the Earth.\n\n3. The Earth is a living system. It is an indivisible, interdependent and interrelated community human beings, nature, the atmosphere, the hydrosphere, and the geosphere. Any substantive alteration of one of its components can affect other areas and the entire system. The Earth is the source of life. It is a system that coordinates physical, chemical, biological and ecological elements in a manner that makes life possible. Through the term \"Mother Earth\", we express this relationship of belonging to a system and respect for our home.\n\n4. Human activity is altering the dynamics and functioning of the Earth system to a degree never before seen. We have exceeded the limits of our system. We have broken harmony with nature. We are living through a series of rising crises that could cause the collapse of the system. It is essential to restore, affirm and guarantee the existence, integrity, interrelation, interaction and regeneration of the Earth system as a whole and of all of its components.\n\nII. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN THE 21ST CENTURY\n\n5. In this century, the two central challenges of sustainable development are to overcome poverty and inequality, and to reestablish balance within the Earth system. Both objectives are intrinsically linked, and one cannot be achieved without the other.\n\n6. It is essential to recognize and affirm that growth has limits. The pursuit of unending development on a finite planet is unsustainable and impossible. It is unsustainable and impossible. The limit to development is defined by the regenerative capacity of the Earth’s vital cycles. When growth begins to break that balance, as we see with global warming, we can no longer speak of it as development, but rather, the deterioration and destruction of our home. A certain level of growth and industrialization is needed to satisfy basic needs and guarantee the human rights of a population, but this level of “necessary development” is not about permanent growth, but rather, balance among humans and with nature.\n\n7. Sustainable development seeks to eradicate poverty in order to live well, not generate wealthy people who live at the expense of the poor. The goal is the satisfaction of basic human needs in order to allow for the development of human capabilities and human happiness, strengthening community among human beings and with Mother Earth. In a world in which 1% of the population controls 50% of the wealth of the planet, it will not be possible to eradicate poverty or restore harmony with nature.\n\n8. To end poverty and achieve an equitable distribution of well being, the basic resources and firms should be in the hands of the public sector and society. Only a society that controls its principal sources of income can aspire to a just distribution of the benefits needed to eliminate poverty.\n\n9. The so-called “developed” countries must reduce their levels of over-consumption to reestablish harmony among human beings and with nature, allowing for the sustainable development of all developing countries. The ecological footprint of the developed countries is between 3 and 5 times larger than the average ecological footprint that the Earth system can sustain without an impact on its vital cycles.\n\n10. The developing countries should follow new paradigms different from those used by developed countries in order to attend to the basic needs of their populations and reestablish harmony with nature. It is not sustainable or viable for all countries to follow the example of developed countries without causing our system to collapse.\n\n11. Sustainable development cannot happen only at the national level. The well being of a country is only sustainable if it contributes to the well being of the entire system. The pillar of sustainable development can only be achieved from a global perspective. The so-called developed countries are still far from reaching sustainable development.\n\nIII. TOOLS FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT\n\n12. In an interdependent and interconnected system like that of Earth, we cannot recognize the rights of the human part of the system without affecting the rest of the system. To reestablish balance with nature, we must acknowledge its intrinsic value and clearly establish the obligations of humans toward nature, and also recognize that nature has rights that should be respected, promoted, and defended. Just as human beings have rights, the Mother Earth also has the right to exist, the right to maintain its vital cycles, the right to regeneration, the right to be free from structural alteration, and the right to relate to the other parts of the Earth system. Without respecting and guaranteeing the rights of nature, it is not possible to guarantee human rights and achieve sustainable development.\n\n13. We have to end the system of consumption, waste and luxury. Millions of people are dying of hunger in the poorest parts of the globe, while in the richest areas, millions of dollars are spent to combat obesity. We must change the unsustainable patterns of consumption, production, and waste through public policy, regulations, and the conscious and active participation of society. This includes promoting ethics that value human beings for what they are, not what they have.\n\n14. To guarantee the human right to water, education, health, communication, transportation, energy and sanitation, above all in the very poor and marginalized sectors, the provision of these services must be essentially public and based on efficient social management, not private business.\n\n15. States should ensure the right of their populations to proper nutrition by strengthening food sovereignty policies that promote: a) food production by farmers, indigenous peoples and small agricultural producers; b) access to land, water, seeds, credit and other resources for family and community producers; c) the development of social and public enterprises for food production, distribution, and sale that prevent hoarding and contribute to the stability of food prices in domestic markets, thus halting speculative practices and the destruction of local production; d) the right of citizens to define what goods they wish to consume, the origins of those goods and how they are produced; e) consumption of what is necessary and the prioritization of local production; f) practices that contribute to reestablishing harmony with nature, avoiding greater desertification, deforestation, and destruction of biological diversity; g) the promotion of the use of indigenous seeds and traditional knowledge. Food production and commercialization must be socially regulated and cannot be left to free market forces.\n\n16. Without water, there is no life. Humans and all living things have the right to water, but water also has rights. All States and peoples worldwide should work together in solidarity to ensure that loss of vegetation, deforestation, the pollution of the atmosphere and contamination are prevented from continuing to alter the hydrological cycle. These cause desertification, lack of food, temperature increase, sea level rise, migrations, acid rain, and physical-chemical changes that can cause ecosystems to die.\n\n17. Forests are essential to the balance and integrity of planet Earth and a key element in the proper functioning of its ecosystems and the broader system of which we are a part. Thus we cannot consider them as simple providers of goods and services for human beings. The protection, preservation and recuperation of forests is required to reestablish the balance of the Earth system. Forests are not plantations that can be reduced to their capacity to capture carbon and provide environmental services. The maintenance of native forests and woodlands is essential for the water cycle, the atmosphere, biodiversity, the prevention of flooding, and the preservation of ecosystems. Forests are also home to indigenous peoples and communities. The preservation of forests should be pursued through integral and participatory management plans financed with public funding from developed countries.\n\n18. It is essential to guarantee a real and effective reduction of greenhouse gases, particularly on the part of the developed countries historically responsible for climate change, in order to stabilize the increase in temperature to 1 °C during this century. We must therefore strengthen the Kyoto Protocol, not replace it with a more flexible voluntary agreement in which each country does what it chooses. It is necessary to eliminate carbon market mechanisms and offsets so that real domestic reductions are made within the countries with said obligations.\n\n19. All forms of violence against women are incompatible with sustainable development, including violence done to women in militarily occupied territories and domestic or sexual violence that treats women as objects.\n\n20. In order for sustainable development to exist, is essential to guarantee the full application of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.\n\n21. Under the framework of common but differentiated responsibilities established in the 1992 Rio Declaration, the so-called developed countries must assume and pay their historical ecological debt for having contributed the most to the deterioration of the Earth system. The payment of this ecological debt to developing countries and the sectors most affected among their own populations consists of the transfer financial resources from public sources and also the effective transfer of appropriate technologies required by developing countries.\n\n22. The resources developed countries dedicate to their defense, security and war budgets should be used to address the effects of climate change and the imbalance with nature. It is inexcusable that 1.5 trillion dollars in public funding are used on these budgets, while, to address the impacts of climate change in developing countries, they want to dedicate just 100 billion dollars from public and private funds as well as market sources by 2020.\n\n23. To address the challenge of achieving sustainable development in the so-called developing countries, a financial transaction tax should be created to help build a Sustainable Development Fund that would be managed by developing countries.\n\n24. Sustainable development requires a new international financial architecture to replace the World Bank and the IMF with entities that are democratic and transparent, that refrain from imposing conditions or structural adjustments, are controlled by the developing countries, and are based on the principles of solidarity and complementarity rather than commercialization and privatization.\n\n25. It is essential to promote the exchange of scientific and technical knowledge and to remove intellectual property barriers to allow a true transfer of environmentally friendly technologies from developed countries to developing countries. An effective Technology Transfer Mechanism should be created based on the need for socially, culturally, and ecologically appropriate technologies in the countries of the South. This mechanism should not be a showcase for the sale of technologies by rich countries.\n\n26. Intellectual property rights over genes, microorganisms and other forms of life are a threat to food sovereignty, biodiversity, access to medicine and other basic elements of the survival of low-income populations. All forms of intellectual property over life should be abolished.\n\n27. Gross Domestic Product is not an adequate means of measuring the development and well being of a society. Thus it is necessary to create indicators for measuring the environmental destruction caused by certain economic activities in order to advance toward sustainable development in harmony with nature, integrating social and environmental aspects that are not aimed at the commercialization of nature and its functions.\n\n28. Respect for the sovereignty of States is essential in the management and protection of nature under the framework of cooperation among States.\n\n29. There is no single solution for all peoples. Human beings are diverse. Our peoples have their own unique cultures and identities. To destroy a culture is to threaten the identity of an entire people. Capitalism attempts to homogenize us all to convert us into consumers. There has not been, nor will there ever be, a single model for life that can save the world. We live and act in a pluralistic world, and a pluralistic world should respect diversity, which is itself synonymous with life. Respect for peaceful and harmonious complementarity among the diverse cultures and economies, without exploitation or discrimination against any single one, is essential for saving the planet, humanity, and life.\n\n30. Peace is essential for sustainable development. There is no worse aggression against humanity and Mother Earth than war and violence. War destroys life. Nobody and nothing is safe from war. Those that fight suffer, as do those that are forced to go without bread in order to feed the war. Wars squander life and natural resources.\n\n31. An International Tribunal of Environmental and Climate Justice must be established to judge and sanction crimes against nature that transcend national borders, violating the rights of nature and affecting humanity.\n\n32. The problems affecting humanity and nature are global in nature, and to address them requires the exercise of global democracy through the development of mechanisms of consultation and decision-making such as referendums, plebiscites, or popular consultations so that the citizens of the world as a whole may speak.\n\n33. Sustainable development is incompatible with all forms of imperialism and neocolonialism. It is essential to end the imposition of conditionalities, military interventions, coups and different forms of blackmail in order to stop imperialism and neocolonialism.\n\n34. The collective global response needed to confront the crisis we face requires structural changes. We must change the system, not the climate or the Earth system. In the hands of capitalism, everything is converted into merchandise: water, earth genomes, ancestral cultures, justice, ethics, life. It is essential to develop a pluralistic system based on the culture of life and harmony among human beings and with nature; a system that promotes sustainable development in the framework of solidarity, complementarity, equity, social and economic justice, social participation, respect for diversity, and peace.\n\nIV. DANGEROUS AND FALSE SOLUTIONS\n\n35. Not all that glitters is gold. Not all that is labeled “green” is environmentally friendly. We must use the precautionary principle and deeply analyze the different “green” alternatives that are presented before proceeding with their experimentation and implementation.\n\n36. Nature cannot be subject to manipulation by new technologies without consequences in the future. History shows us that many dangerous technologies have been released in the market before their environmental or health impacts are known, or before their social and economic impacts on poor people and developing countries are understood. This is currently the case with genetically modified organisms, agrochemicals, biofuels, nanotechnology, and synthetic biology. These technologies should be avoided.\n\n37. Geoengineering and all forms of artificial manipulation of the climate should be prohibited, for they bring the enormous risk of further destabilizing the climate, biodiversity and nature.\n\n38. It is necessary to create public and multilateral mechanisms within the United Nations to evaluate in an independent manner and without conflict of interest the potential environmental, health, social, and economic impacts of new technologies before they are spread. This mechanism must involve transparency and social participation by potentially affected groups.\n\n39. The current ecological and climate crisis has put in jeopardy all of life on planet Earth, and thus it requires deep solutions based on the real causes of the climate crisis. It cannot be reduced to a simple market failure, which is a reductionist and narrow view.\n\n40. The solution is not to put a price on nature. Nature is not a form of capital. The green economy should not distort the fundamental principles of sustainable development. It is wrong to say that we only value that which has a price, an owner, and brings profits. The market mechanisms that permit exchange among human beings and nations have proven incapable of contributing to an equitable distribution of wealth. To use an approach based on market principles and private appropriation to try to resolve the problem of inequality – itself a product of capitalism – is like trying to put out a fire with gasoline.\n\n41. It is wrong to fragment nature into “environmental services” with a monetary value for market exchange. It is wrong to put a price on the capacity of forests to act as carbon sinks, and worse to promote their commercialization as does REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation). The market for carbon credits based on forests will lead to: a) noncompliance with effective emission reduction commitments by developed countries; b) the bulk of resources being appropriated by intermediaries and financial entities and rarely benefiting countries, indigenous peoples and forests themselves; c) the generation of speculative bubbles based on the sale and purchase of said certificates; and d) the establishment of new property rights over the capacity of forests to capture carbon dioxide, which will clash with the sovereign rights of States and the indigenous peoples that live in forests. To promote market mechanisms based on the economic needs of developing countries is a new form of neocolonialism.\n\n42. “Green” capitalism will bring about natural resource grabbing, displacing humanity and nature from the essential elements needed for their survival. The drive for profit, instead of reestablishing harmony within the system, will provoke even greater imbalances, concentrations of wealth, and speculative processes.\n\nV. GLOBAL GOVERNMENT AND SOCIAL PARTICIPATION\n\n43. It is necessary to establish a United Nations organization to promote sustainable development in harmony with nature. This organization should articulate and unite the different authorities involved in order to avoid overlapping efforts and achieve effective coordination. Developing countries should have majority representation in said organization, and its functioning should be democratic, transparent, and accountable.\n\n44. This organization should articulate all of the conventions regarding nature without leaving aside issues central to the United Nations, such as water.\n\n45. Social participation is essential in this new organization. Workers, women, farmers, indigenous peoples, young people, scientists, and all sectors of society should be represented. The private sector cannot have the same amount of influence as the social sectors, given that, by definition, its goal is to create profit rather than social wellbeing. Effective mechanisms for interaction among all social actors are required.\n\n"}

It was one of the Highway Acts 1835 to 1885.\n\nThe Highway Act 1835 placed highways under the direction of parish surveyors, and allowed them to pay for the costs involved by rates levied on the occupiers of land. The surveyor's duty is to keep the highways in repair, and if a highway is out of repair, the surveyor may be summoned before the courts and ordered to complete the repairs within a limited time. The surveyor is also charged with the removal of nuisances on the highway. A highway nuisance may be abated by any person, and may be made the subject of indictment at common law.\n\nThe board consists of representatives of the various parishes, called \"way wardens\" together with the justices for the county residing within the district. Salaries and similar expenses incurred by the board are charged on a district fund to which the several parishes contribute; but each parish remains separately responsible for the expenses of maintaining its own highways.\n\nThe amending acts, while not interfering with the operation of the principal act, authorize the creation of highway districts on a larger scale. The justices of a county may convert it or any portion of it into a highway district to be governed by a highway board, the powers and responsibilities of which will be the same as those of the parish surveyor under the former act.\n\nThe Highway Act 1835 specified as offences for which the driver of a carriage on the public highway might be punished by a fine, in addition to any civil action that might be brought against him:\n\n\nSection 72 provides: \"If any person shall wilfully ride upon any footpath or causeway by the side of any road made or set apart for the use or accommodation of foot passengers; or shall wilfully lead or drive any horse, ass, sheep, mule, swine, or cattle or carriage of any description, or any truck or sledge, upon any such footpath or causeway; or shall tether any horse, ass, mule, swine, or cattle, on any highway, so as to suffer or permit the tethered animal to be thereon.\"\n\nThis clause is referred to by the current Highway Code:\n\nThe Public Health Act 1875 vested the powers and duties of surveyors of highways and vestries in urban authorities,\n\nThe Local Government Act 1888 the entire maintenance of main roads was thrown upon county councils.\n\nThe Local Government Act 1894 transferred to the district councils of every rural district all the powers of rural sanitary authorities and highway authorities.\n\n"}
{"id": "5162975", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5162975", "title": "International Organization of Securities Commissions", "text": "International Organization of Securities Commissions\n\nThe International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) is an association of organisations that regulate the world’s securities and futures markets. Members are typically primary securities and/or futures regulators in a national jurisdiction or the main financial regulator from each country. Its mandate is to:\n\nIOSCO has members from over 100 different countries, who regulate more than 95% of the world's securities markets. It has a permanent secretariat in Madrid, Spain.\n\nIOSCO was born in 1983 from the transformation of its ancestor the \"Inter-American Regional Association\" (created in 1974) into a truly global cooperative. This decision to expand the organisation beyond the Americas was made at the annual gathered in Quito, Ecuador, in April 1983. At the same time, the organisation was renamed to IOSCO to reflect the expanded membership beyond North and South America. Securities regulators from France, Indonesia, Korea, and the United Kingdom were the first agencies to join from outside the Americas. The IOSCO July 1986 Paris Annual Conference was the first to take place outside of the American continents and on that occasion a decision was made to create a permanent General Secretariat for the Organisation. One remnant of its early inter-American roots is that IOSCO's \"official\" languages are English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese.\n\nIn 1998 IOSCO started work on a number of important policies that led to broader set of guidelines. However it was the September 11, 2001 attacks as well as a series of large global financial scandals that started with Enron and including Worldcom, Parmalat, and Vivendi that brought urgency to this work and heralded IOSCO's evolution from an international “talk shop”, where little of substance was accomplished, to a serious international organisation with a real impact on the securities regulation. At the 1999 conference in Lisbon, it was decided to have a permanent headquarters for the administrative General Secretariat and that it should be based in Madrid.\n\nIn 2002 IOSCO adopted a multilateral memorandum of understanding (IOSCO MMoU) designed to facilitate crossborder enforcement and exchange of information among the international community of securities regulators. Then in 2005 IOSCO MMoU become the benchmark for international cooperation among securities regulators.\n\nAs of February 2018, IOSCO had 218 members. IOSCO members are divided into three main categories:\n\n\nThe organisation is made up of a number of committees that meet several times a year at different locations around the world supported by a permanent administrative General Secretariat.\n\nAdministratively, IOSCO is run by a General Secretariat based in Madrid, Spain. IOSCO’s current Secretary General is Paul P. Andrews, who started his renewable three-year term in March 2016. Previously, he served as the Vice President and Managing Director of Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) a self-regulatory organization in the United States.\n\nThe IOSCO Board is IOSCO's governing and standard-setting body. It is composed of 33 securities regulators; Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission CEO Ashley Ian Alder is the IOSCO Board Chair (he also chairs the Asia-Pacific Regional Committee). He is supported by two Vice Chairs, Ranjit Ajit Singh, Chair of the Securities Commission Malaysia (who chairs the Growth and Emerging Markets Committee, IOSCO's largest sub-committee) and Jean-Paul Servais, Chair of Belgium's Financial Services and Markets Authority (who chairs the European Regional Committee as well).\n\nIOSCO has four regional committees:\n\nThe Technical Committee has been described as the one involving the most \"grunt work\". In short, it is made up of 16 of the larger securities agencies that regulate more developed markets. It is \"self-constituting\" in the sense that it determines which countries will be a member and it also determines procedures and agendas. In 1991, former SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden was elected Chair of the technical committee and implemented reforms that gave it a \"new vigor and a new resolution\" that \"bespoke an organization confident of its footing and its mission\".\n\nIOSCO is a member of, participates as an observer in, or coordinates with a number of other organisations. One of its most important relationships is with the Joint Forum of international financial regulators. IOSCO, along with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, make up the Joint Forum.\n\nThe IOSCO MOUs are considered the primary instruments to facilitate crossborder cooperation, reduce global systemic risk, protect investors, and ensure fair and efficient securities markets.\n\nAdditionally, IOSCO is a member of, participates as an observer in, or coordinates with a number of other international organisations, including the OECD, FSB, Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering, IASB, PIOB, IMF, World Bank, and European Commission.\n\nIOSCO adopted in 1998 a comprehensive set of \"Objectives and Principles of Securities Regulation\" (IOSCO Principles). These continue to be developed and expanded. IOSCO recommends all its members to adopt these and helps its members assess the level of compliance with the principles. These include;\n\n\n"}
{"id": "285182", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=285182", "title": "International Securities Identification Number", "text": "International Securities Identification Number\n\nAn International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) uniquely identifies a security. Its structure is defined in ISO 6166. The ISIN code is a 12-character alphanumeric code that serves for uniform identification of a security through normalization of the assigned National Number, where one exists, at trading and settlement.\n\nISINs were first used in 1981, but didn't reach wide acceptance until 1989, when the G30 countries recommended adoption. The ISIN was endorsed a year later by ISO with the ISO 6166 standard.\n\nInitially information was distributed via CD-ROMs and this was later replaced by distribution over the internet.\n\nIn 2004 the European Union mandated the use of instrument identifiers in some of its regulatory reporting, which included ISIN as one of the valid identifiers.\n\n\"ISO 6166\" (or ISO6166:2013 as of the 2013 revision) defines the structure of an International Securities Identification Number (ISIN). An ISIN uniquely identifies a fungible security.\n\nSecurities with which ISINs can be used are:\n\nISINs consist of two alphabetic characters, which are the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code for the issuing country, nine alpha-numeric characters (the National Securities Identifying Number, or NSIN, which identifies the security, padded as necessary with leading zeros), and one numerical check digit. They are thus always 12 characters in length. When the NSIN changes due to corporate actions or other reasons, the ISIN will also change. Issuance of ISINs is decentralized to individual national numbering agencies (NNAs). Since existing national numbering schemes administered by the various NNAs form the basis for ISINs, the methodology for assignment is not consistent across agencies globally.\n\nAn ISIN cannot specify a particular trading location, or another identifier, typically a MIC (Market Identifier Code) or the three-letter exchange code, will have to be specified in addition to the ISIN. The currency of the trade will also be required to uniquely identify the instrument using this method.\n\nSince 1989, when ISINs were introduced, they have slowly gained traction worldwide in their usage.\n\nISINs are being introduced worldwide and are the most popular global securities identifier. Trading, clearing and settlement systems in many countries have adopted ISINs as a secondary measure of identifying securities. Some countries, mainly in Europe, have moved to using the ISIN as their primary means of identifying securities. In addition new European regulations such as Solvency II increasingly require the ISIN to be reported.\n\nThe ISIN is generally included in services sold by financial data vendors and intermediaries. These services are normally paid services as more value added data is included with the information. In general, the issuer of a security will include the ISIN in issuance papers or other documentation for identification purposes.\n\nIn 2009, Standard & Poor's was formally charged by the European Commission (EC) with abusing its position in licensing international securities identification codes for United States securities by requiring European financial firms and data vendors to pay licensing fees for their use. \"This behaviour amounts to unfair pricing\", the EC said in its statement of objections which lays the groundwork for an adverse finding against S&P. \"The (numbers) are indispensable for a number of operations that financial institutions carry out – for instance, reporting to authorities or clearing and settlement – and cannot be substituted”.\n\nIn 2011, Standard and Poor's provided six undertakings to the European Commission to remedy the situation. The agreement is applicable to all consuming companies in the European Economic Area. These expired at the end of 2016.\n\nThe examples below describes one approach for applying the Luhn algorithm on two different ISINs. The difference in the two examples has to do with if there are an odd or even number of digits after converting letters to number. Since the NSIN element can be any alpha numeric sequence (9 characters), an odd number of letters will result in an even number of digits and an even number of letters will result in an odd number of digits. For an odd number of digits, the approach in the first example is used. For an even number of digits, the approach in the second example is used. The Luhn algorithm can also be applied in the same manner for both types or lengths (alternating multiply the string of digits by 1 and 2, starting from the end of the string), being more generic.\n\nApple, Inc.: ISIN US0378331005, expanded from CUSIP 037833100\nThe main body of the ISIN is the original CUSIP, assigned in the 1970s. The country code \"US\" has been added on the front, and an additional check digit at the end. The country code indicates the country of issue. The check digit is calculated using the Luhn algorithm.\n\nConvert any letters to numbers:\n\nU = 30, S = 28. US037833100 -> 30 28 037833100 \n\nCollect odd and even characters:\n\n3028037833100 = (3, 2, 0, 7, 3, 1, 0), (0, 8, 3, 8, 3, 0)\n\nMultiply the group containing the rightmost character (which is the FIRST group) by 2:\n\nAdd up the individual digits:\n\n(6 + 4 + 0 + (1 + 4) + 6 + 2 + 0) + (0 + 8 + 3 + 8 + 3 + 0) = 45\n\nTake the 10s modulus of the sum:\n\n45 mod 10 = 5\n\nSubtract from 10:\n\n10 - 5 = 5\n\nTake the 10s modulus of the result (this final step is important in the instance where the modulus of the sum is 0, as the resulting check digit would be 10).\n\n5 mod 10 = 5\n\nSo the ISIN check digit is five.\n\nTREASURY CORP VICTORIA 5 3/4% 2005-2016: ISIN AU0000XVGZA3.\nThe check digit is calculated using the Luhn algorithm.\n\nConvert any letters to numbers:\n\nA = 10, G = 16, U = 30, V = 31, X = 33, Z = 35.

The country code \"GB\" is then added on the front, and the check digit on the end as in the example above.\n\nThe Treasury Corporation of Victoria ISIN illustrates a flaw in ISIN's check digit algorithm which allows transposed letters: Suppose the ISIN was mis-typed as AU0000VXGZA3 (instead of AU0000XVGZA3)\n\nA = 10, G = 16, U = 30, V = 31, X = 33, Z = 35. \"AU0000VXGZA\" -> 10 30 00 00 31 33 16 35 10\".\n\nCollect odd and even characters:\n\n103000003133163510 = (1, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1), (0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 6, 5, 0)\n\nMultiply the group containing the rightmost character (which is the SECOND group) by 2:\n\nAdd up the individual digits:\n\n(1 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 1) + (0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 6 + (1 + 2) + (1 + 0) + 0) = 27\n\nTake the 10s modulus of the sum:\n\n27 mod 10 = 7\n\nSubtract from 10:\n\n10 - 7 = 3\n\nTake the 10s modulus of the result (this final step is important in the instance where the modulus of the sum is 0, as the resulting check digit would be 10).\n\n3 mod 10 = 3\n\nSo the ISIN check digit is \"still\" three even though two letters have been transposed.\n\nSuch flaw against a single transposed pair of letters or digits would have been avoided using two check digits instead of just one (i.e., a 97 modulus instead of the 10 modulus, like in IBAN numbers which may also mix letters and digits). Some protocols require the transmission of additional check digits added to the full ISIN number.\n\n\n"}

While the substance has been marketed as a cure for cancer, originally sold for thousands of dollars per dose in the 1950s and early 1960s, Krebiozen is not known to possess any therapeutic value. Attempts to analyze its composition have shown that Krebiozen consists only of the amino acid creatine dissolved in mineral oil, and some samples sold as Krebiozen consist solely of mineral oil with no other discernible ingredients.\n\nThe American Cancer Society states: \"Available scientific evidence does not support claims that Krebiozen is effective in treating cancer or any other disease.\" According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), creatine has been linked to several dangerous side effects.\n\nKrebiozen was initially promoted by Stevan Durovic, a Yugoslavian physician who claimed that the substance came from horse serum inoculated with \"Actinomyces bovis\". Durovic claimed that Krebiozen had been useful in the treatment of cancer, mainly in cats and dogs. His claims were backed by Andrew Conway Ivy, a prominent physiologist, and by several politicians including Senator Paul Douglas (D-IL). Ivy became convinced that Krebiozen possessed anti-cancer properties, administered the substance to himself and colleagues, then to a dog, and eventually started testing Krebiozen on patients.\n\nIvy called a press conference in 1951 at which he announced to an audience of journalists, politicians, doctors and potential investors that Krebiozen was a success. At the press conference, Ivy claimed that of 22 treated patients, 14 were alive and none had died of cancer. However, in reality 10 of the treated patients had died—all of cancer—at the time of the press conference. Shortly afterward, the Krebiozen Research Foundation was established by the Durovic brothers, with Ivy as president.\n\nIntrigued by Ivy's announcement, 10 hospitals and cancer research centers followed up on the trial and attempted to reproduce Ivy's claimed results. None of these independent researchers observed any effect of Krebiozen on cancer. A compilation of these institutions' negative data was reported in the \"Journal of the American Medical Association\" in 1951. Krebiozen's backers responded by alleging a conspiracy against the drug. In 1959, Ivy began producing his own version of the drug under the name \"Carcalon\".\n\nOn October 28, 1964, the Durovics, Ivy and the Krebiozen Research Foundation were indicted for introducing mislabeled drugs into interstate commerce in violation of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. After a 9-month trial, the case ended with a hung jury and they were acquitted. Soon afterwards, Durovic was indicted for tax evasion and fled the United States.\n\nIn order to evaluate Durovic's and Ivy's claims, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) requested samples of Krebiozen. These were provided on two occasions to the NCI and one occasion to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Durovic proposed to charge the NCI $170,000 per gram of Krebiozen, although ultimately the samples were provided free of charge. However, the FDA spectrophotometry team, led by Alma Levant Hayden, proved the samples consisted only of creatine monohydrate, a simple amino acid, sometimes dissolved in mineral oil. When the FDA went back to test previously acquired samples of Krebiozen, they found that many lacked even creatine, and consisted solely of mineral oil with no discernible active ingredients.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "59511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59511", "title": "Legislatures of the United Kingdom", "text": "Legislatures of the United Kingdom\n\nThe Legislatures of the United Kingdom are derived from a number of different sources from both within the UK and through membership of the European Union. The Parliament of the United Kingdom is the supreme legislative body for the United Kingdom and the British overseas territories with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland each having their own devolved legislatures. Each of the three major jurisdictions of the United Kingdom (England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland) has its own laws and legal system.\n\nThe United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (commonly known as the UK Parliament, the British Parliament, the Westminster Parliament or \"Westminster\") is the supreme legislative body for the United Kingdom and also for English Law. It alone possesses legislative supremacy and thereby ultimate power over all other political bodies in the UK and its territories. Its head is the Sovereign of the United Kingdom (currently Queen Elizabeth II) and its seat is the Palace of Westminster in Westminster, London.\n\nThe United Kingdom Legislation may take the form of Acts (passed directly by Parliament) or Statutory Instruments, made under the authority of an Act of Parliament by either a government minister or by the Queen-in-Council. The latter are generally subject either to parliamentary approval (affirmative procedure) or parliamentary disallowance (negative procedure). The majority of Acts considered in the UK are defined as public general acts, or 'Acts of Parliament' as they will have progressed and gained approval as a Bill through both House of Commons and House of Lords, and also have gained Royal Assent from the Monarch. Local and Personal Acts of Parliament are also presented to Parliament as a result of sponsored petitions. These, however, are processed through committees to enable relevant or affected parties to challenge or change the proposed Act. Prerogative instruments, made by the Sovereign under the royal prerogative are another source of UK-wide legislation.. The UK Parliament is responsible for all matters relating to defence and all foreign affairs and relations with international organisations, particularly the United Nations, the Commonwealth and the European Union.\n\nWith there being no devolved legislature in England the UK Parliament is also the supreme body for its governance, legislation, public bodies and local government.\n\nThe House of Commons is the lower house of the Parliament of the United Kingdom and is an elected chamber consisting currently of 650 members known as Members of Parliament (MPs) which are elected using First past the post in single-member constituencies with 533 elected from England, 59 from Scotland, 40 from Wales and 18 from Northern Ireland. \n\nThe House of Commons is now considered to be the supreme chamber of Parliament.\n\nThe House of Lords is the upper house of the Parliament of the United Kingdom however it is an unelected chamber with all members to the House of Lords being appointed. As of August 2018, there are currently 793 members known as \"Peers\". The House of Lords no longer has the same powers as the House of Commons under the Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949 especially when it comes to blocking general legislation and the passing of financial legislation.\n\nThe Scottish Parliament is the national, unicameral legislature of Scotland, located in the Holyrood area of the capital, Edinburgh. The Parliament, informally referred to as \"Holyrood\", is a democratically elected body comprising 129 members known as Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). Of these 73 MSPs are elected using First past the post in single member constituencies and a further 56 MSPs are elected using the D'Hondt method, a form of party-list proportional representation in eight additional member regions with each region electing 7 MSPs.\n\nThe Scottish Parliament was convened by the Scotland Act 1998, which sets out its powers as a devolved legislature. The Act delineates the legislative competence of the Parliamentthe areas in which it can make lawsby explicitly specifying powers that are \"reserved\" to the Parliament of the United Kingdom: all matters that are not explicitly reserved are automatically the responsibility of the Scottish Parliament. The British Parliament retains the ability to amend the terms of reference of the Scottish Parliament, and can extend or reduce the areas in which it can make laws. The first meeting of the new Parliament took place on 12 May 1999.\n\nThe Scottish Statutory Instruments made by the Scottish Government are another source of legislation. As with Statutory Instruments made by the British government, these are generally subject to either approval or disallowance by the Scottish Parliament\n\nThe National Assembly for Wales has the power to make legislation in Wales. The Assembly was created by the Government of Wales Act 1998, which followed a referendum in 1997. It is a democratically elected body with 60 members known as Assembly Members (AMs). Of these 40 AMs are elected using First past the post in single member constituencies and a further 20 MSPs are elected using the D'Hondt method, a form of party-list proportional representation in five additional member regions with each region electing 4 AMs. The Assembly had no powers to initiate primary legislation until limited law-making powers were gained through the Government of Wales Act 2006. Its primary law-making powers were enhanced following a Yes vote in the referendum on 3 March 2011, making it possible for it to legislate in the 20 areas that are devolved without having to consult the UK Parliament, nor the Secretary of State for Wales. The Assembly may also delegate authority to enact legislation through Welsh Statutory Instruments. Under the Wales Act 2017 the Assembly came into line with Scotland and Northern Ireland and moved to a resevered powers model. \n\nIt is expected that the National Assembly for Wales will be renamed the \"Welsh Parliament\" before the next scheduled election in 2021.\n\nThe Northern Ireland Assembly is the devolved legislature of Northern Ireland which is a democratically elected body comprising 90 members known as Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs). The 90 MLAs are elected using the single transferable vote across the 18 Westminster Parliamentary constituencies with each constituency electing 5 MLAs. It was established in 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement which was approved by the public in referendums which were held in both Northern Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland. It has power to legislate in a wide range of areas that are not explicitly reserved to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, and to appoint the Northern Ireland Executive. It sits at Parliament Buildings at Stormont in Belfast. Legislation of the Assembly empowers the Northern Ireland Executive to issue Statutory Rules in a variety of areas.\n\nThe Assembly has not met since 26 January 2017 owing to a breakdown of trust which brought down both the Assembly and Executive.\n\nAs a member state of the European Union (EU) under the European Communities Act 1972 the decisions, directives and regulations of the EU are directly applicable with full legal force in the United Kingdom and is also supreme to all domestic legislation, in effect another source of UK legislation. The United Kingdom became a member when it joined what was originally known as the European Communities on 1 January 1973.\n\nCurrently the United Kingdom is negotiating its exit from the organisation and its institutions following a referendum in 2016 which resulted in a narrow majority vote in favour of leaving and is expected to officially leave on 30 March 2019. \n\nThe European Parliament (EP) is the directly elected parliamentary institution of the European Union. Together with the Council of the European Union (the Council) and the European Commission, it exercises the legislative function of the EU. The Parliament is composed of 751 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), who represent the second-largest democratic electorate in the world (after the Parliament of India) and the largest trans-national democratic electorate in the world (375 million eligible voters in 2009).\n\nThe United Kingdom sends 73 members to the European Parliament, of these 70 MEPs are elected using the D'Hondt method, a form of party-list proportional representation in 11 regional constituencies in England, Scotland and Wales while in Northern Ireland 3 MEPs are elected using the single transferable vote in a single national constituency.\n\n\n\n"}

She is Robert W. Woodruff Professor of Law at Emory University School of Law. Fineman was previously the first holder of the Dorothea S. Clarke Professorship of Feminist Jurisprudence at Cornell Law School and held the Maurice T. Moore Professorship at Columbia Law School.\n\nFineman is one of the most influential figures in feminist legal theory and critical legal theory and directs the Feminism and Legal Theory Project, which she founded in 1984. Much of her early scholarship focuses on the legal regulation of family and intimacy, and she has been called \"the preeminent feminist family theorist of our time.\" She has since broadened her scope to focus on the legal implications of universal dependency, vulnerability and justice. Her recent work formulates a theory of vulnerability, in order to argue for a more responsive state and a more egalitarian society. She is a prominent progressive liberal thinker; she has been an affiliated scholar of John Podesta's Center for American Progress and has been described as a \"close friend of the Obama administration.\"\n\nFineman has a B.A. from Temple University (1971) and a J.D. from the University of Chicago (1975). After graduating from law school, she clerked for the Hon. Luther Merritt Swygert of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and was on faculty at the University of Wisconsin Law School from 1976 to 1990. Subsequently, Fineman moved to Columbia Law School, where she was appointed as the Maurice T. Moore Professor of Law in 1990. She went on to become the first Dorothea S. Clarke Professor of Feminist Jurisprudence at Cornell Law School in 1999; the professorship being the first endowed chair in feminist jurisprudence at a law school in the United States. Since 2004, she has been a Robert W. Woodruff Professor of Law at Emory University School of Law, which is the institution's highest honor bestowed on a faculty member. The honor is \"reserved for world-class scholars who are not only proven leaders of their own fields of specialty, but also ambitious bridge-builders across specialty disciplines.\" She is the third legal scholar after Harold J. Berman and Michael J. Perry to be appointed to such a chair.\n\nFineman directs the Feminism and Legal Theory Project, which she founded in 1984 and which has been housed by the University of Wisconsin Law School, Columbia Law School, Cornell Law School, and Emory Law. The Feminism and Legal Theory Project nurtures scholars from around the world, bringing them together to study and debate a wide range of topics related to feminist theory and law. She also directs the Vulnerability and the Human Condition Initiative which was founded in 2008 at Emory Law School. Fineman is an affiliated scholar of the Center for American Progress.\n\nIn September of 2018, she was ranked the #1 Most-Cited Family Law Faculty in the U.S. for the period 2013-2017 on \"Brian Leiter\" Law School Reports, based on Sisk Annual Report data. \n\nIn her 2004 book \"The Autonomy Myth: A Theory of Dependency\", Fineman \"argues that popular ideology in the United States has become fixated on the myth that citizens are and should be autonomous. Yet the fact that dependency is unavoidable in any society and must be dealt with to sustain the polity, Fineman contends, gives the state the responsibility to support caretaking.\"\n\nHer 2008 article \"The Vulnerable Subject\" in the \"Yale Journal of Law and Feminism\" develops a theory of vulnerability in order to argue for a more responsive state and a more egalitarian society. The article forms the basis for her 2011 book, also titled \"The Vulnerable Subject\".\n\nFineman argues:\n\nVulnerability is and should be understood to be universal and constant, inherent in the human condition. The vulnerability approach is an alternative to traditional equal protection analysis; it represents a post-identity inquiry in that it is not focused only on discrimination against defined groups, but concerned with privilege and favor conferred on limited segments of the population by the state and broader society through their institutions. As such, vulnerability analysis concentrates on the institutions and structures our society has and will establish to manage our common vulnerabilities. This approach has the potential to move us beyond the stifling confines of current discrimination-based models toward a more substantive vision of equality.\n\nAccording to Selberg and Wegerstad,\n\nFundamental to Fineman's scholarly work is a feminist critique of notions of equality, the liberal subject and prevailing anti-discrimination politics. According to Fineman, the current anti-discrimination doctrine assumes that discrimination is the discoverable and correctable exception to an otherwise just and fair system, characterized by values such as individual liberty and autonomy. Developing her work on dependency, Fineman raises the question: if our bodily fragility, material needs, and the possibility of messy dependency they signify cannot be ignored in life, how can they be absent in our theories about equality, society, politics and law?' Moving beyond gender and other identity categories, Fineman uses the concept of vulnerability to 'define the very meaning of what it means to be human.'\n\nFineman is the recipient of numerous scholarly awards, including the 2008 Cook Award from the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University, and the 2006–2007 Leverhulme Visiting Professorship, one of the United Kingdom's top academic honors. She is also the recipient of the prestigious Harry Kalven Prize, awarded by the Law and Society Association to a scholar whose body of \"empirical scholarship has contributed most effectively to the advancement of research in law and society.\" In March 2004, a symposium of some 500 scholars and students gathered at Emory University School of Law to celebrate the scholarship of its three Robert W. Woodruff Professors of Law, Harold J. Berman, Martha Albertson Fineman, and Michael J. Perry, and Visiting Professor Martin E.

{"id": "549443", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=549443", "title": "Montreal Convention", "text": "Montreal Convention\n\nThe Montreal Convention (formally, the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air) is a multilateral treaty adopted by a diplomatic meeting of ICAO member states in 1999. It amended important provisions of the Warsaw Convention's regime concerning compensation for the victims of air disasters. The Convention attempts to re-establish uniformity and predictability of rules relating to the international carriage of passengers, baggage and cargo. Whilst maintaining the core provisions which have served the international air transport community for several decades (i.e., the Warsaw regime), the new treaty achieves modernization in a number of key areas. It protects passengers by introducing a two-tier liability system that eliminates the previous requirement of proving willful neglect by the air carrier to obtain more than US$75,000 in damages, which should eliminate or reduce protracted litigation.\n\nUnder the Montreal Convention, air carriers are strictly liable for proven damages up to 100,000.00 special drawing rights (SDR), a mix of currency values established by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) equal to roughly $150,000 USD. Where damages of more than 100,000.00 SDR are sought, the airline may avoid liability by proving that the accident which caused the injury or death was not due to their negligence or was attributable solely to the negligence of a third party. This defense is not available where damages of less than 100,000.00 SDR are sought. The Convention also amended the jurisdictional provisions of Warsaw and now allows the victim or their families to sue foreign carriers where they maintain their principal residence, and requires all air carriers to carry liability insurance.\n\nThe Montreal Convention was brought about mainly to amend liabilities to be paid to families for death or injury whilst on board an aircraft.\n\nThe Convention refuses to pay any compensation for psychiatric injury or damage unless inextricably linked to the physical injury. Purely psychiatric injury is not eligible for compensation which has been criticised by people injured in plane accidents, legal experts and their families.\n\nAustralia changed its law so as to fit with the Montreal Convention including in some of the following ways\n\n\nIndependent Australian senator Nick Xenophon will introduce a private member's bill into the Australian Parliament in May 2015 which will seek to protect the rights of plane crash survivors to be compensated for psychological trauma.\n\nLeading Australian current affairs TV show 4 Corners on the government owned broadcaster ABC, broadcast a program focusing on the unfairness and injustice of excluding psychiatric injury on March 23, 2015 featuring Karen Casey, a nurse injured when the medical evacuation flight she was nursing on crashed in the waters off Norfolk Island.\n\nThe Montreal Convention changes and generally increases the maximum liability of airlines for lost baggage to a fixed amount 1,131 SDR per passenger (the amount in the Warsaw Convention is based on weight of the baggage). It requires airlines to fully compensate travelers the cost of replacement items purchased until the baggage is delivered, to a maximum of 1,131 SDR. At 21 days any delayed baggage is considered lost, until the airline finds and delivers it.\n\nThe limitation of compensation for damage to baggage to 1,131 SDRs means that the value of damaged mobility equipment may often significantly exceed available compensation under the Montreal Convention, while the effect of the loss, even temporarily, of mobility equipment places disabled passengers at a substantially increased disadvantage in comparison to other passengers suffering damaged baggage. While for non-disabled people the major issue is the loss of hold baggage, for disabled people the problem tends to be physical damage to wheelchairs and other durable medical equipment due to inappropriate stowage in the hold. Even a basic individually-fitted wheelchair may cost twice the available compensation, with a three month lead time for replacement. There have been further problems with airlines being reluctant to recognise that cheap mass-market wheelchairs may be unsuitable as even a temporary replacement due to the common need for customised seating solutions among long-term wheelchair users.\n\nThe EU in \"Communication on the scope of the liability of air carriers and airports in the event of destroyed, damaged or lost mobility equipment of passengers with reduced mobility when traveling by air\" notes this disadvantage in relation to EC 1107/2006 \"rights of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility when traveling by air\".\n\nThe EU report notes that the United States under the Air Carrier Access Act and Canada under Part VII of the Air Transport Regulations have taken action to force airlines to fully cover the costs of damage to mobility equipment as a condition of allowing an airline to operate in their airspace, and notes that the EU may have to take similar steps if the additional duties imposed on airlines by EC 1107/2006 do not resolve the issue.\n\nAs September 2018, there are 133 parties to the Convention. Included in this total is 132 of the 191 ICAO Member States plus the European Union. The states that have ratified represent 131 UN member states plus the Cook Islands. Other states that have ratified include Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, all member states of the European Union, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Nepal Norway, Pakistan, Russia Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "140559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=140559", "title": "National Assembly", "text": "National Assembly\n\nNational Assembly politically is either a legislature, or the lower house of a bicameral legislature in some countries. In the English language it generally means \"an assembly composed of the representatives of the nation.\" The population base represented by this name is manifestly the nation as a whole, as opposed to a geographically select population, such as that represented by a provincial assembly. Its powers vary according to the type of government. It may possess all the powers, generally governing by committee, or it may function within the legislative branch of the government.\n\nThe name also must be distinguished from the concept. Conceptually such an institution may appear under variety of names, especially if \"national assembly\" is being used to translate foreign names of the same concept into English. Also, the degree to which the National Assembly speaks for the nation is a variable. To achieve a quorum, the ancient Athenian Assembly employed Scythian police to arrest citizens at random from the street. On the other hand, the early Parliaments of Europe were mainly of an aristocratic composition. The word had its origins and inspirations from the National Assembly that was responsible for drafting a constitution during the French Revolution.\n\nThe exact words, \"national assembly,\" have been used prolifically in the international community of nations since the 18th and 19th centuries, considered the Age of Revolution in western Europe. Nations that formed republics in this age subsequently formed empires. Extensive cross-cultural influences brought much of their language and institutions to the provinces. When these empires collapsed finally, the emancipated countries formed states and other institutions on the model of the former imperial nations. Some examples of international influences are as follows:\n\nIn Germany, a Nationalversammlung was elected following the revolutions of 1848–1849 and 1918–1919, to be replaced by a permanent parliament (Reichstag) later. The legislature of the Estado Novo regime in Portugal was known as the National Assembly, while the Corporative Chamber was a purely advisory chamber. The national assembly was also defined in the Republic of China constitution. This is different from the Legislative Yuan by the ROC constitution. In 2005, Taiwan revised the constitution and national assembly was abolished. Examples have multiplied greatly under the policy of self-determination adopted by the western nations. Many more are to be found in the articles listed below.\n\nPerhaps the best known National Assembly was that established during the French Revolution in 1789, known as the \"Assemblée nationale\". Consequently, the name is particularly common in Francophone countries. It was also the name of the legislature during France's First Republic and the Consulate, and since 1946 has been the lower house of the French parliament, first under the Fourth Republic, and from 1958, the Fifth Republic.\n\nThe expression, however, did not originate in 1789. It was already in use in the French language of the times. Louis XIII of France (1601-1643), \"par la grace de Dieu Roy de France & de Navarre\", in a \"Declaration\" of April 14, 1627, concerning the sovereignty of his kingdom, prohibits ministers of foreign countries from any jurisdiction in France, citing, as precedent, his \"Lettres de Declaration\" of April 17, 1623, forbidding religious officials from treating with foreign countries. He describes his \"Declaration\" as \"ordonné qu'en Assemblées Provinciales & Nationales des nosdites sujets\". This was the \"registration\" that the Parlement of Paris refused to perform for Louis XVI of France in 1787-1788. When the Estates-General of 1789 formed the National Assembly of 1789, they did not believe they were instituting anything new. In the Assembly of Notables of 1787, Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette had used National Assembly and Estates General synonymously when he suggested that France needed a national assembly to solve its financial problems.\n\nNational Assembly is also found in some Commonwealth countries. Its use there is not a translation of \"Assemblée nationale\", as the phrase is equally embedded in the English language. For example, at the end of the First English Civil War, an Act of Parliament, 1648, \"Concerning the Members of the Classical and Congregational Presbyteries, in the several counties of the Kingdom of England, and Dominion of Wales,\" establishes a national congregational church in England and Wales, corresponding to the presbyteries of Scotland. The language is: \"The National Assembly shall be constituted of members chosen by and sent from the several Provincial Assemblies.\" This National Assembly appears to have no direct link to any French words, although the concept is the same.\n\n"}

{"id": "12982124", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12982124", "title": "Occupational exposure limit", "text": "Occupational exposure limit\n\nAn occupational exposure limit is an upper limit on the acceptable concentration of a hazardous substance in workplace air for a particular material or class of materials. It is typically set by competent national authorities and enforced by legislation to protect occupational safety and health. It is an important tool in risk assessment and in the management of activities involving handling of dangerous substances. There are many dangerous substances for which there are no formal occupational exposure limits. In these cases, hazard banding or control banding strategies can be used to ensure safe handling.\n\nOccupational Exposure Limits (OELs) have been established for airborne workplace chemicals by multiple regulatory and authoritative organizations around the world for well over 60 years now. With the changing regulatory arena, shifting centers of manufacturing growth, and the move towards a more global view on occupational hygiene issues, it is important for the Occupational Hygiene profession to understand the current and growing issues impacting the continued viability of OEL’s in our professional practice.\n\nAlthough peer-reviewed health-based OELs are preferred for establishing safe levels of exposure or for implementing adequate controls to provide worker protection, the lack of publicly available OELs have led to other sources of safe levels to protect workers. Industrial or Occupational Hygienists are often on the front line of anticipating and recognizing the hazards of chemical exposure for workers, and must assess the risk of exposure through the use of OELs so that proper control strategies can be implemented to keep workers below the OEL values. In the absence of OELs however, there are a variety of tools that can and should be used to assess exposure potential of workers. The \"Hierarchy of OELs\" provides a continuum of occupational exposure limit values that allow assessment of the risk of exposure in order to apply adequate controls.\nPersonal air sampling is routinely conducted on workers to determine whether exposures are acceptable or unacceptable. These samples are collected and analyzed using validated sampling and analytical methods. These methods are available from OSHA Technical Manual and NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods Statistical tools are available to assess exposure monitoring data against OELs. The statistical tools are typically free but do require some previous knowledge with statistical concepts. A popular exposure data statistical tool called \"IH STAT\" is available from AIHA (American Industrial Hygiene Association). IHSTAT has 14 languages including English and is available for free.\n\nMethods for performing occupational exposure assessments can be found in \"A Strategy for Assessing and Managing Occupational Exposures, Third Edition Edited by Joselito S. Ignacio and William H. Bullock\".\n\n\nThe database ″GESTIS - International limit values for chemical agents″ contains a collection of occupational limit values for hazardous substances collected from over 30 countries: various EU member states, Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Switzerland, China, Turkey, and the United States. The database comprises values of more than 2,000 substances.\n\nThe present database was elaborated in co-operation with experts from various international occupational safety and health institutions. It aims to give an overview of limit values in different countries. Since the limit values vary in their handling, the level of protection, and their legal relevance, the original lists of limit values and the explanations there should be considered as primary sources. Also the chemical nomenclature is diverging, synonyms can for example be found in the GESTIS Substance Database.\n\nThe database is also available as app for mobile terminals with Android or iOS operating systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Ombudsman has legal authority to request information and to summon representatives from the municipalities, counties and other authorities to talks, but hold no regulatory powers. There's no government mandate to focus or issue an opinion on individual cases. However, the Ombudsman has a legal duty of notification, meaning they are required by law to report to the local social services, whenever they become aware of an abused child. \n\nThe Ombudsman holds regular dialogues with children, especially those in vulnerable situations, to obtain knowledge of their conditions and their opinions. The agency report back to the government once a year, and the report consists of a magazine, usually with a specific theme; with additional information presented on the Ombudsman's website. \n\nIn 1990 the Riksdag ratified the CRC. Sweden was thereby committed under international law to implement the Convention, and around the same time the Government appointed a Commission of inquiry to examine the issue of appointing an Ombudsman for Children.

Its head is an Attorney General who has deputies. DORH headquarters are in Zagreb, but it is also decentralized and is thus divided into 22 municipal and 15 county offices. Nevertheless, it is a strictly hierarchically structured body, so municipal offices are subordinated to the county offices, while country offices are subordinated to the central office in Zagreb. In addition, Croatian State Prosecutor's Office for the Suppression of Organized Crime and Corruption (USKOK) is a special body of DORH specialized in investigations related to corruption and organized crime.\n\nOrganization and jurisdiction of the State's Attorney Office are regulated with \"The Act on the State's Attorney Office\".\n\nThe State’s Attorney Office competent in criminal proceedings is obligated to prosecute and represent the charges against perpetrators of criminal acts which are prosecuted \"ex officio\" or upon the proposal and undertake other actions defined by the law.

The discovery of the private key would allow end users to flash their own operating systems onto the device without having to use any special software. Moody used two free implementations of the general number field sieve, msieve and ggnfs; the computation took 73 days on a 1.9 GHz dual-core processor. This demonstrates the progress of hardware development: the factorization of the similar 512-bit RSA-155 in 1999 using the same algorithm required a large dedicated research group, 8000 MIPS-years of computing time, and a Cray C916 supercomputer.\n\nIn response, members of the wider TI graphing calculators community (at yAronet) set up a BOINC-based distributed computing project, RSA Lattice Siever (RSALS for short), that quickly factored the other keys.\nRSA Lattice Siever remained active for nearly three years after outliving its initial purpose, by factoring other integers for the mathematical community.\nAfter factoring over 400 integers, RSALS moved to RSALS-inspired NFS@home at the end of August 2012.\n\nTexas Instruments began by sending out two initial DMCA take-down requests to the hackers, referring to sites or forum posts that they controlled. The hackers responded by removing the keys, without consulting an attorney. TI then sent further DMCA notices to a variety of websites displaying the keys, including United-TI, reddit, and Wikipedia. Texas Instruments' efforts then became subject to the Streisand effect, and the keys were mirrored on a number of sites, including WikiLeaks and WordPress. In September 2009, Dan Goodin from \"The Register\" alerted the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) to TI's actions, and the EFF agreed to take on the case \"pro bono\", representing three people who had received DMCA notices.\n\nOn October 13, 2009, the EFF sent a letter to TI warning them that the posting of the keys did not violate the DMCA, and that it may be liable for misrepresentation. Despite the letter by the EFF, TI continued to send DMCA notices to websites that posted the keys, but stopped doing so after late 2009. The EFF filed a DMCA Section 512 counter-notice on behalf of three of the bloggers who received DMCA notices. When the EFF did not receive a response by the deadline, the bloggers re-posted the content that had been taken down.\n\nThe public RSA parameters of the original TI-83+ / TI-83+ Silver Edition OS signing key factored by Benjamin Moody are the following 512-bit modulus \"n\" and public (or encryption) exponent \"e\" (specified in hexadecimal):\n\nBy factoring \"n\", Moody obtained the factors \"p\" (252 bits) and \"q\" (260 bits), which can be used in turn to quickly compute the 512-bit private (or decryption) exponent :\n\nThe value \"d\" can then be used to sign arbitrary OS software.\n\nThe keys factored by RSA Lattice Siever (the TI-92+, TI-73, TI-89, Voyage 200, TI-89 Titanium, TI-84+ / TI-84 Silver Edition OS signing and date-stamp signing keys) are similar but with different values of \"n\", \"p\", \"q\", and \"d\".

Its importance rests on the fact that it integrated customary international law with American law, perhaps the quintessential position of those who hold a monist perspective of international law.\n\nIn April 1898 two fishing vessels, the \"Paquete Habana\" and the \"Lola\", separately left Cuban ports in Havana in order to fish. The two vessels were eventually captured by US merchant vessels as part of Admiral William T. Sampson's blockade of Cuba, who was ordered to execute the blockade 'in pursuance of the laws of the United States, and the \"law of nations\" applicable to such cases.' The vessels were placed within Cuba's territorial waters at the onset of the Spanish–American War and then taken to Key West, where both vessels were eventually auctioned by the district court. Both vessels were valued under the price of $2,000(US) and were thus not originally thought to be exempt from seizure.\n\nAdmiral Sampson justified the seizures by stating that most fishing vessels, flying under the Spanish banner were manned by excellent seamen, \"liable for further service\" as naval reserves, an asset that could eventually be used against US interests in the Spanish–American War.\n\nThe owners of the vessels however made an appeal to the circuit courts, citing a long-held tradition by nations of exempting fishing vessels from prize capture in times of war. This \"tradition\", a primary example of customary international law, dates back from an order by Henry IV in 1403, and has more or less been observed by a large majority of States ever since.\n\nAt the time of capture both vessels had no evidence of aiding the enemy, and were unaware of the US naval blockade. No arms were found on board, and no attempts were made to either run the blockade or resist capture.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court cited lengthy legal precedents established to support the existence of a customary international law that exempted fishing vessels from prize capture, dating all the way back to ancient times and occurring repeatedly between Great Britain and France. In 1403, King Henry IV of England issued his officers leave fisherman alone during times of war. He then signed a treaty with France reaffirming this act between both parties. Again in 1521 between Emperor Charles V and Francis I of France a treaty was assigned. This treaty was invoked due to a desperate rise in the markets for herring. With the war between the two countries raging on, fisherman dared not venture out to sea. Therefore, a treaty was necessary on both accounts to prevent starvation among those who relied upon cheap herring, namely the lower classes. Situations similar to this continued to crop up throughout history prior to the Paquete case.\nUsing this as a basis for customary law, the court then eventually found the capture of both vessels as \"unlawful and without probable cause\", reversed the District Court's decision, and ordered the proceeds of the auction as well as any profits made from her cargo to be restored to the claimant, \"with damages and costs\".\n\nJustice Fuller delivered a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justices Harlan and McKenna.\n\n\n"}

The signatories were, for Russia, Ivan Zakharov, consul-general of Ili, and Ivan Fedorovich Babkov, colonel of the Separate Siberian Corps of the General Staff, and, for China, Ming I, general of Uliastai; Hsi Lin, \"amban\" of Tarbagatai; and Bolgosu, Tarbagatai brigade commander. By this agreement, Russia gained about 350,000 square miles of territory at the expense of Chinese Xinjiang, and Lake Balkhash went from lying on the border to being entirely surrounded by Russia. It is sometimes numbered among the \"unequal treaties\".\n\nA Russian and Chinese border commission assembled at T'a-ch'eng (also known as Tarbagatai or Chuguchak) in China on 13 May 1861 in order to map the western border in accordance with Article III of the Treaty of Peking of 1860. The actual surveying did not begin until 11 July 1862. Both countries sought to influence the survey by the threat of military force and by alliances with local tribes, but the Russian delegation was under orders to insist on a border determined by topography and not by the boundaries between local ethnic groups. According to Babkov, \"The deployment of our forces on the border clearly demonstrated to the Chinese that we had the means to uphold our demands with an armed hand whenever we wished. [This deployment] on our side of the Chinese pickets, under no circumstances can be considered a violation of international law or of friendly relations: all forces are deployed on the lands of the Kirghiz, who are Russian subjects, and ... are under strict orders never to cross the permanent Chinese picket line.\"\n\nNegotiations were burdened by disagreements in interpreting Article II of the Treaty of Peking. The Chinese argued that it could not be taken as the basis for negotiations since the Chinese delegate who negotiated it was ignorant of central Asian conditions. The article also failed to distinguish between the different Chinese picket lines. The Chinese delegation argued that the outermost picket line was intended, while the Russians insisted that only the innermost picket line of permanent control could count. Both claimed the inhabitants between the two picket lines as their own subjects. The Russians rejected all Chinese maps as unscientific. The first round of negotiations ended in failure in September 1862.\n\nIn the summer of 1863 the Russians sent out an independent survey team, which resulted in skirmishes between Russian and Chinese troops. The objective of Russian policy in settling its border with China in 1858–64 was to establish control over a region and negotiate recognition of its sovereignty after the fact. The intensification of the Dungan Revolt that broke out in the spring of 1862 drew China's attention away from the border and toward internal security in Xinjiang. When the Chinese finally signed a protocol delimiting the border in Russia's favour, the delegates warned the Russians that the rebels were approaching Tarbagatai. The rebel leader, Yaqub Beg, initially refused to recognise the new border and recruited Kirghiz from the Russian side. As a result of the rebellion, the border markers, which were to be set up in 1865, were not put in place until 1869. Further border protocols were signed at Khovd in 1869 and at Tarbagatai in 1870.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56310838", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56310838", "title": "Tunnel rock recycling", "text": "Tunnel rock recycling\n\nTunnel rock recycling is a method to process rock debris from tunneling into other usable needs. The most common is for Concrete aggregates or as Subbase (pavement) for roadbuilding. Crushers and screeners normally used in quarries are placed at the tunnel site for the one purpose which is to crush and screen the rock debries. Swiss engineers/entreprenours have the most comprehensive experience in this field. The largest tunnel rock recycling facility ever to be created was for the construction of the Gotthard Base Tunnel which took 17 years, finishing in 2016.\n\nIn an average tunnel project the excavated rock is mostley regarded as waste. In most cases it's given away or used in a landfill. Starting up a facility for recycling the rock debries are hugely expensive. Though for a large project as for example a double barrel tunnel longer than 20 km it's feasible. The Gotthard base tunnel was a 57 km long tunnel.\n\nExcavated rock utilized as concrete aggregate is beneficial both economically and environmentally. It could be more value generating compared to using the excavated rock as landfill or filling up old quarries. Additionally, the need for transporting aggregate could be significantly reduced as the utilization of the rock could be placed close by with a processing facility and a concrete bathing plant. The investment cost of this facility would be repaid in the long run as the project would be close to self-supplied on construction aggregates.\n\nThere are two main types of tunneling, Drill & Blast(D&B) and Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) and both methods allow for recycling, if rock quality is approved. Both methods requires some sort of processing. TBMs creates rock particles with exsessive amounts of fines, this is a problem for both subbase and concrete aggregate, max diameter of particles is approximately 170 mm. When it comes to D&B the particles can get up to 800 mm and there is a much coarser fraction, to large for subbase and concrete aggregate. The processing facility has the following choises to edit the rock mass: reduce rock size, remove fines and reduce moisture content.\n\nBy 2018, there are confirmed 7 projects worldwide which have accomplished recycling of tunnel rock(TBM) on an industrial level. These projects are all placed in Western Europe and in hard rock. The concrete has either been used as shotcrete or concrete elements in TBM tunneling.\n\nBy the data from the table above its on average possible to recycle 20% of the tunnel debries. The reason for the low percentage of recycled material is largely due to the large portion filler created while drilling. In industry concrete recipes there is no need for all this filler as it would destroy the flow of the concrete in its fresh state.\n\nThe main role in processing tunnel rock is crushing the rocks into smaller sizes. rock crushing is divided into two methods based on compression or impact resulting in different type of fragmentation of the material. Crushers are used in the aggregate and mineral industry and can also be divided into stationary and mobile plants. Setup of the crushers, feed size and speeds plays a major role in production of high quality construction aggregates. At a certain stage in the comminution, the rock material fragments down to free minerals grains as e.g. free Mica or Quartz minerals. In Figure below are the different crusher types listed. For cubification of the rock, the Vertical shaft impactor( VSI) is a suiting crusher. The technology lets the rock crash into each other and splitting at the naturall cleavege lines. This is favorable for both subbase and concrete aggregate.\n\nIn Tunnel boring machine(TBM) tunneling mechanical screening (scalping screener) is normally the first stage of the processing of tunnel rock. The screener removes rock particles below 16 or 20 mm diameter. This is to remove the high amounts of fines which is created when TBM tunneling in hard rock. To much fines in concrete aggregates are unwated.\n\nIf a tunnel project want to create concrete aggregates as 0/8 mm or 0/4 mm fractions it requires a more advance processing facility. Classification covers the size control of particles < 1mm. Conventional screeners and crushers are not applicable below this size A range of methods can be used for classification, though all builds on certain fundamentals. These are utilizing the natural gravitational force and the particles corresponding behavior to separate the particles into fractions or dividing a liquid from particles (dewatering/clarifying). One type of classifier is the Air classifier. Classification accuracy will be of relevance as concrete aggregates do have boundary limits according to Particle-size distribution(grading) on Filler (materials) in the sand fraction. Particles in this size range do also tend to cluster together. These phenomena are called agglomeration and is unfortunate in terms of concrete batching. \nRemoving fines is often done with water involved, this requires a water treatment plant to clean the water. This can be done with sedimentation tanks and filter press, requiring quite a lot of space. The water which is cleansed can go back into removing more fines from the tunnel rock, and the cycle countinious. \nRecycling rock to produce concrete aggregate is a complex procedure and will require an on-site laboratory at the tunnel project. Concrete aggregate has strict requirement which must be tested, this can in some cases require between 5-15 different laboratory tests. Regarding mehanical strength, grading and impurities.\n\nThe requirements of the aggregate from tunnel rock is tested and measured on the same level as concrete aggregate from quarries.\n\nDue varying water flowing through a rock massif it's normally an uncertanty what the moisture content of the rock material will be. This must be measured because it will affect the free water added during the concrete mixing, a high moisture content will require less free water to be added.\n"}

It amended the Vagrancy Act 1824 to provide that any person discharged from custody pending an appeal against a conviction under that Act who did not then reappear to prosecute the appeal could be recommitted. It also provided that the penalty established by that Act for exposing indecent prints in a street or highway would extend to those who exposed the same material in any part of a shop or house.\n\nThis latter part of the Act was to prove significant in a number of prosecutions of artists for allegedly exhibiting obscene works of art, even when those exhibitions took place in a private space such as an art gallery. One of the most notorious successful prosecutions of an artist under the act was in 1929, when thirteen paintings by D. H. Lawrence at the Warren Gallery, London, were seized by the police. A ban was placed on the paintings being shown in England, which is technically still in force, but they were shown again in London in December 2003.\n\nThe last artist to be successfully prosecuted under the 1838 Act was Stass Paraskos in 1966, following a police raid on an exhibition of Paraskos's work at Leeds College of Art. Again a ban was placed on showing the offending paintings and drawings in England, which is also still legally valid. However one of the paintings was shown at Leeds City Art Gallery in 1993, and again at Scarborough Art Gallery in 2000, and several others are now owned by the Tate Gallery, London. In 1969 a total of 35 people were prosecuted under section 2 of the Act and section 4 of the 1824 Act for acts of public display of obscene images in shop windows and exhibitionism. \n\nAlthough aspects of the Act had been repealed in a piecemeal fashion by subsequent legislation, the full Act was formally repealed in 1981 by the Indecent Displays (Control) Act 1981 (c. 42), partly due to the lack of clarity in distinguishing between indecency and obscenity.\n\n"}

McLean (R) of Connecticut that prohibited the spring hunting and marketing of migratory birds and the importation of wild bird feathers for women's fashion, ending what was called \"millinery murder\". It gave the Secretary of Agriculture the power to set hunting seasons nationwide, making it the first U.S. law ever passed to regulate the shooting of migratory birds. It became effective on 4 March 1913 but, because of a constitutional weakness, was later replaced by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.\n\n"}
