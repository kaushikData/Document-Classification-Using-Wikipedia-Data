{"id": "21981132", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21981132", "title": "Animal treatment in rodeo", "text": "Animal treatment in rodeo\n\nThe welfare of animals in rodeo has been a topic of discussion for the industry, the public, and the law for decades. Protests were first raised in the 1870s, and, in the middle twentieth century, laws were enacted to curb events using animals. The American Humane Association (AHA) has worked with the rodeo industry (specifically, the PRCA) to establish rules improving animal welfare in rodeo and the treatment of rodeo animals.\n\nToday, animal cruelty complaints in rodeo are still very much alive. The PRCA (which governs about a third of the rodeos conducted in the United States annually) has provided rules for its members regarding animal welfare. However the concept of rodeo has changed from year to year, derving from the amount of people not in the event increasing. Some local rodeos have banned the use of certain rodeo tack including flank straps and certain events such as steer tripping. Some \"charreada\" events staged in the United States saw a crack down in the early years of the twenty-first century.\n\nJames Serpell stated in his \"In the Company of Animals\":\n\nIt is perhaps exaggerated to claim, as one author has, that the rodeo is 'the modern equivalent of the public hanging'. Nevertheless, these performances hinge on the violent subjugation of living animals, some of which are deliberately incited to frenzied violence by raking them with spurs, constricting the genital region with leather straps, or by thrusting an electric prod into the rectal area. At the same time they are often given bogus, malevolent names in order to deflect sympathy from their plight. Occasionally, they are maimed or killed, and many are forced to undergo the same terrifying ordeal several times a day. Yet the rodeo is presented to the American public as a harmless, red-blooded entertainment in which the cowboy – the epitome of wholesome, manly virtue – uses his courage and skill to overcome and subdue untamable, outlaw stock. Doubtless, the Romans employed similar fantasies to justify their activities in the Circus Maximus.\n\nProtests were first raised regarding animal welfare in the 1870s, and, beginning in the 1930s, some states enacted laws curtailing rodeo activities and other events involving animals. In the 1950s, the then Rodeo Cowboys Association worked with the American Humane Association (AHA) to establish regulations protecting the welfare of rodeo animals that were acceptable to both organizations. These regulations appear in the PRCA's annually-updated rule book. Rodeo saw its greatest growth in the 1970s and with it a rise in animal cruelty complaints. The PRCA and AHA have insinuated that these charges exist solely for the fund-raising purposes of other humane interest groups. The protests and complaints have made the PRCA realize that public education regarding rodeo and the welfare of animals needs to be undertaken if rodeo is to survive.\n\nIn his \"Author's Note\" to \"Chasing the Rodeo\" (2005, 2006) author W.K. Stratton states, \"Without question, rodeo exploits animals for the entertainment of humans, causing injury and death to hundreds of horses and cattle each year.\" Stratton notes that as many as a dozen head of steer and calves will die annually at a single large rodeo like the Calgary Stampede, and that many valuable roping horses have died over the years at the Pendleton Roundup which is conducted on slippery grass. He also points out that while PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) characterizes rodeo as \"cruelty for a buck\", conservative Matthew Scully, a special assistant to and former speechwriter for President George W. Bush as well as author of \"\" calls rodeo \"gratuitous abuse of animals\". Stratton notes that he attended twenty plus rodeos and bullriding events in researching his book and saw \"animals injured in the arena, some badly enough that they had to be destroyed.\"\n\nModern rodeos in the United States are closely regulated and have responded to accusations of animal cruelty by instituting a number of rules to guide how rodeo animals are to be managed.\n\nIn 1994, a survey of 28 sanctioned rodeos was conducted by on-site independent veterinarians. Reviewing animal runs, the injury rate was documented 0.047% (16 animals in 33,991 runs.\n\nIn 2000, a survey conducted by independent veterinarians at 57 PRCA rodeos found 0.053% (38 animal injuries in 71,743 animal exposures).\n\nA 2001 survey reported an injury rate of 0.056% in 21 PRCA rodeos (15 animals in 26,584 performances).\n\nA later PRCA survey of 60,971 animal performances at 198 rodeo performances and 73 sections of \"slack\" (competitions outside of the main competition events) indicated 27 animals were injured, i.e. 0.04%\n\nIn Australian rodeos, similar injury rates occur. Basic injuries occur at a rate of 0.072% (one in 1,405), with injuries requiring veterinary attention at 0.036% (one injury each 2,810 times an animal is used in competition).\n\nAccusations of cruelty in US rodeos persist. The PRCA acknowledges they sanction only about 30% of all rodeos, another 50% are sanctioned by other organizations and 20% are completely unsanctioned. Several animal rights and animal welfare organizations keep records of accidents and incidents of possible animal abuse. They cite various specific incidents of injury to support their statements, and also point to examples of long-term breakdown, as well as reporting on injuries and deaths suffered by animals in non-rodeo events staged on the periphery of professional rodeo such as chuck wagon races and \"Suicide Runs.\" In terms of statistics on animal injury rate during rodeos, there appear to be no independent studies more recent than the 1994 study.\n\nGroups such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) note incidents of animal injury, including an incident where a \"bull [sic] suffered from a broken neck ...\" According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), practice sessions are often the scene of more severe animal welfare abuses than competitions.\n\nIn 1990, when a major rodeo was planned for the Toronto Sky Dome, Ontario, Canada, the Toronto City Council requested the Toronto Medical Officer on Health to report on rodeo practices and whether \"such practices could be deemed cruel to animals\". The Medical Officer noted that animal handlers employed electric prods, flank straps, sharpened sticks, spurs and other tack were used to provoke animals into reacting in such a way as to make certain events thrilling for spectators, and thus it was unlikely to be enjoyable for livestock.\n\nThe Medical Officer further noted that guidelines instituted to prevent animal abuse at sanctioned rodeos were paid little heed and calves suffered damage not readily visible such as bruised tracheal cartilage in roping events. All bucking events were found by the Medical Officer to rely on the application of irritants to make the animals \"fly\" from the chutes. The Medical Officer stated in his summary that in terms of a dictionary definition of cruelty, most rodeo events have the potential to cause injury, grief, or pain, and therefore can be considered cruel. Although the Medical Officer did not say that the legal definition of cruelty had been met, he implied that it had been \"reached, if not crossed.\"\n\nE.J. Finocchio, DVM wrote the Rhode Island legislature urging a ban on calf roping: \"As a large animal veterinarian for 20 years ... I have witnessed first hand the instant death of calves after their spinal cords were severed from the abrupt stop at the end of a rope when traveling up to 30 mph. I have also witnessed and tended calves who became paralyzed ... and whose tracheas were totally or partially severed ... Slamming to the ground has caused rupture of several internal organs leading to a slow, agonizing death for some of these calves.\"\n\nC.J. Haber, a veterinarian with 30 years experience as a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) meat inspector notes, \"The rodeo folk send their animals to the packing house where ... I have seen cattle so extensively bruised that the only areas where the skin was attached [to the body] was the head, neck, legs, and belly. I have seen animals with six to eight ribs broken from the spine and at times puncturing the lungs.\"\n\n\"The Calgary Humane Society opposes the use of animals for any form of entertainment in which they are placed at risk of suffering undue stress, pain, injury or death.\"\n\nGiven its position on animals in entertainment, CHS opposes rodeo events like chuckwagon racing, calf-roping and steer wrestling that are the most often implicated in injury to animals.\n\nWhile other organizations may wish to intervene through protest, or other means, CHS has found it can best protect the interests of the animals involved by working with organizations that put on such events. Over more than a decade of work with the Calgary Stampede, Calgary Humane Society has been instrumental in significant changes that have reduced injuries (for example, changes to the chuckwagon track that reduced stress fractures to the legs of horses; penalizing of calf-roping that yanked the calf backward) and eliminated certain high risk events (like wild cow milking).\n\nCHS does its work by providing recommendations to the organizations, by following up on public complaints, and by having its Peace Officers attending these events to ensure the province's Animal Protection Act (APA) is upheld.\n\nUnder Alberta and Canadian law, Calgary Humane Society's primary role in attendance of the Calgary Stampede is to enforce the Animal Protection Act of Alberta.Calgary Humane Society Peace Officers attend every day of the Stampede to monitor and ensure the animals are being properly treated i.e., food, water, shelter and care. They are also immediately on scene of any accident involving an animal to ensure the animal is being treated promptly, efficiently and humanely, to document what happened, and to follow up with the unresolved cases.\n\nCHS encourages concerned citizens to document their complaints and send them to the agencies and individuals listed in the attached document.\n\nThe Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) takes a position of opposition to all rodeos and rodeo events:\n\nThe HSUS opposes rodeos as they are commonly organized, since they typically cause torment and stress to animals; expose them to pain, injury, or even death; and encourage an insensitivity to and acceptance of the inhumane treatment of animals in the name of sport. Accordingly, we oppose the use of devices such as electric prods, sharpened sticks, spurs, flank straps, and other rodeo equipment that cause animals to react violently, and we oppose bull riding, bronco riding, steer roping, calf roping, \"wild horse racing,\" chuck wagon racing, steer tailing, and horse tripping.\n\nThe Humane Society of the United States came into being in 1954 as an offshoot of the American Humane Association (AHA), and initially tackled legislation regarding humane slaughter, the protection of laboratory animals and other issues. In the 1970s, the organization began eyeing rodeo and its \"psychologically damaging\" effect on children.\n\n\"Vancouver Humane Society is opposed to rodeo because most rodeo events involve the use of fear, stress or pain to make animals perform.\" In Canada, the City of Vancouver and the District of North Vancouver have banned rodeos. For the most part, all animal welfare organizations in Canada oppose rodeo, including the Humane Society of Canada and the Canadian Federation of Humane Societies.\n\nPETA criticizes the United States military in its annual expenditure of tax dollars to support the Professional Bull Riders (PBR), stating that American tax dollars are fueling \"horrific and cruel rodeo events\". PETA asserts that rodeo animals suffer fear and pain through the application of spurs, flank straps, prods, and tail-twisting.\n\nPETA has used some unorthodox methods to make its point. Moments after being crowned, Miss Rodeo America 2000 had a chocolate tofu 'cow pie' pushed in her face by a PETA member. PETA President, Ingrid Newkirk, said in a statement that Miss Rodeo America should relinquish her crown for promoting cruelty to animals. \"Now that she's got pie on her face, we hope Miss Rodeo America will find a little compassion in her heart,\" Newkirk said. The pageant is held in conjunction with the National Finals Rodeo, an event PETA annually protests against, claiming the sport exploits animals.\n\nThe ASPCA has a policy statement on rodeo events that reads:\n\nThe ASPCA is opposed to all rodeo events that involve cruel, painful, stressful and potentially harmful treatment of livestock, not only in performance but also in handling, transport and prodding to perform. The ASPCA recognizes the cruel treatment inflicted on many additional animals in the process of practicing to compete in rodeo events. Further, the ASPCA is opposed to children's rodeo events such as goat tying, calf riding and sheep riding (\"mutton busting\"), which do not promote humane care and respect for animals.\n\nThe American Humane Association (AHA) used to campaign against rodeo through anti-rodeo literature but changed its strategy in the 1950s and began working with rodeo to establish rules to ensure the humane treatment of livestock. The rules are updated as needed and published annually in the PRCA's rule book. The AHA believes the exploitation of animals begins when \"animals, people, and money\" are mixed together, and what progress has been made is ascribed to a change in people's attitudes in general and the urban and college background of modern rodeo participants. Moral philosopher Peter Singer has criticized the AHA for collaborating with rodeo and thereby lending respectability to its cruelties. The AHA has strict requirements for the treatment and use of animals in movie rodeo scenes. The use of electric prods and other artificial stimuli to make an animal perform are forbidden, for example.\n\nThe RSPCA Australia is opposed to rodeo. It has repeatedly called for rodeo to be banned, and has funded media campaigns urging public boycott of prominent international rodeos. Its policy statement reads:\n\nThe PRCA admits it only oversees about a third of the actual rodeos that occur in the United States annually, and, according to their own public relations information, the organization has taken steps to improve the welfare of animals. The organization says that most rodeo animals enjoy what they're doing. The PRCA's regulations and rules require, among other things, provisions for injured animals, veterinarians on site at PRCA sanctioned rodeos, and spurs with dulled, free-spinning rowels. Health regulations mandate vaccinations and blood testing of animals crossing state lines, and sick or injured animals are given appropriate veterinary care.\n\nIn an article published by the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) in its Journal dated January 2001, Dr. James Furman, a former rodeo rider and mixed practice practitioner, stated at the organization's Animal Welfare Forum that ranchers provide their stock health and other care. When grilled about the possible damage to a calf's neck when he is roped and jerked to a sudden stop, Dr. Furman responded by observing that rodeo men have changed calf roping techniques; where they once roped and flipped a calf on its back they now try to spin the standing calf around.\n\n\"Charreada\" is amateur rodeo among Mexican Americans in the United States with family-owned arenas being operated for 200 teams in 12 states. Eight states have cracked down on several traditional events including horse-tripping, an event in which the front legs of a running mare are roped causing her to fall, and steer tailing in which a steer is flipped to the earth by grabbing his tail. Some Mexican Americans have expressed concerns their culture is being unfairly targeted and point to the deaths of Eight Belles and other race horses as evidence that Anglo sports involving animals see few restrictions.\n\nRodeo sometimes appears in court. A PRCA stock contractor faced animal cruelty charges regarding the use of a prod at a California rodeo in 2002. Testimony revealed a rodeo judge and a veterinarian had been consulted before the rodeo about a chute-stalling horse, and an agreement had been reached that if the horse stalled, the prod would be applied to protect all involved. California law stipulates a prod cannot be used on an animal in a holding chute unless necessary to protect participants and spectators. The stock contractor was cleared of charges because the chute gate was open when the prod was used, and therefore it was not a holding chute.\n\nIn response to animal welfare and animal cruelty concerns, a number of laws have passed regulating rodeo. In the United Kingdom the Protection of Animals Act 1934 effectively made rodeo, as it was then practiced, illegal in England, Scotland and Wales. In September 2000, California became the first American state to prohibit the use of prods on any animal in a chute.\n\nStringent regulations have virtually eliminated rodeo in Rhode Island, a state which also stipulates that any individual convicted of animal cruelty in a rodeo cannot participate as a rodeo contestant. While there is no record in any state of anyone being convicted of cruelty to animals during the course of a rodeo, several states—Arizona, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming—all exempt rodeo from its anticruelty laws, making such convictions impossible. Eleven of the states immunize rodeo events from the provisions of the law, while Utah excludes rodeo animals from the definition of 'animal' in its anitcruelty laws. Idaho has declared exhibitions that are commonly considered acceptable cannot be charged with cruelty to animals.\n\nAfter a video aired on NBC showing a bull breaking its leg in a 1991 Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania rodeo, the city banned controversial rodeo tack, specifically electric prods or shocking devices, flank or bucking straps, wire tie-downs, and sharpened or fixed spurs or rowels. Pittsburgh also requires humane officers be provided access to any and all areas where animals may go–specifically pens, chutes, and injury pens.\n\nFort Wayne, Indiana does not allow anyone to conduct a rodeo within the city limits. In 1998, Woodstock, Illinois made fighting or wrestling with any animal illegal, thus ending steer wrestling. Ohio has restricted some rodeo practices, having outlawed unpadded flank and bucking straps and the use of electric prods on cattle and horses. Rodeo was banned in the United Kingdom in 1934 when Parliament passed the Protection of Animals Act. Baltimore, Maryland, Southampton, New York, and Pompano Beach, Florida have enacted legislation banning certain rodeo tack including bullwhips. St. Petersburg, Florida has banned rodeo within the city limits—the only complete ban on rodeo in the United States.\n\n\n\n"}

Civil liberties are simply defined as individual legal and constitutional protections from entities more powerful than an individual, for example, parts of the government, other individuals, or corporations. The liberties explicitly defined, make up the Bill of Rights, including freedom of speech, the right to bear arms, and the right to privacy. There are also many liberties of people not defined in the Constitution, as stated in the Ninth Amendment: \"The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\" \n\nThe extent of civil liberties and the periphery of the population of the United States who had access to these liberties has expanded over time. For example, the Constitution did not originally define who was eligible to vote, allowing each state to determine who was eligible. In the early history of the U.S., most states allowed only white male adult property owners to vote (about 6% of the population). The 'Three-Fifths Compromise' allowed the southern slaveholders to consolidate power and maintain slavery in America for eighty years after the ratification of the Constitution. And the Bill of Rights had little impact on judgements by the courts for the first 130 years after ratification.\n\nThe text of Amendment I to the United States Constitution, ratified December 15, 1791, states that:\n\nThe text of Amendment I to the United States Constitution, ratified December 15, 1791, states that:\n\nThe text of Amendment I to the United States Constitution, ratified December 15, 1791, states that:\n\nThe text of Amendment I to the United States Constitution, ratified December 15, 1791, states that:\n\nThe text of Amendment I to the United States Constitution, ratified December 15, 1791, states that:\n\nThe following types of speech are not protected constitutionally: defamation or false statements, child pornography, obscenity, damaging the national security interests, verbal acts, and fighting words. Because these categories fall outside of the First Amendment privileges, the courts can legally restrict or criminalize any expressive act within them. Other expressions, including threat of bodily harm or publicizing illegal activity, may also be ruled illegal.\n\nThe text of Amendment II to the United States Constitution, ratified December 15, 1791, states that:\n\nThe concept of sexual freedom includes a broad range of different rights that are not mentioned in the U.S. Constitution. The idea of sexual freedom has sprung more from the popular opinion of society in more recent years, and has had very little Constitutional backing. The following liberties are included under sexual freedom: sexual expression, sexual choices, sexual education, reproductive justice, and sexual health. Sexual freedom in general is considered an implied procedure, and is not mentioned in the Constitution. \n\nSexual freedoms include the freedom to have consensual sex with whomever a person chooses, at any time, for any reason, provided the person is of the age of majority. Marriage is not required, nor are there any requirements as to the gender or number of people you have sex with. Sexual freedom includes the freedom to have private consensual homosexual sex (\"Lawrence v.

A closing argument occurs after the presentation of evidence. A closing argument may not contain any new information and may only use evidence introduced at trial. It is not customary to raise objections during closing arguments, except for egregious behavior. However, such objections, when made, can prove critical later in order to preserve appellate issues.\n\nIn the United States, the plaintiff is generally entitled to open the argument. The defendant usually goes second. The plaintiff or prosecution is usually then permitted a final rebuttal argument. In some jurisdictions, however, this form is condensed, and the prosecution or plaintiff goes second, after the defense, with no rebuttals. Either party may waive their opportunity to present a closing argument.\n\nDuring closing arguments, counsel may not (among other restrictions) vouch for the credibility of witnesses, indicate their personal opinions of the case, comment on the absence of evidence that they themselves have caused to be excluded, or attempt to exhort the jury to irrational, emotional behavior.\n\nIn some countries (e.g. France or Germany), in criminal cases, the defendant's counsel always makes his closing argument last, after the public prosecutor or any other party. Sometimes the defendant is allowed to address the court directly after his or her counsel's closing argument.\n\nIn a criminal law case, the prosecution will restate all the evidence which helps prove each element of the offence. In the USA, there are often several limits as to what the prosecution may or may not say, including precluding the prosecution from using a defendant's exercise of his Fifth Amendment right to silence as evidence of guilt. One of the most important restrictions on prosecutors, however, is against shifting the burden of proof, or implying that the defense must put on evidence or somehow prove the innocence of the defendant.\n\nIn some cases, a judge's presentation of the jury instruction is also known as summing up. In this case, the judge is merely articulating the law and questions of fact upon which the jury is asked to deliberate.\n\nThe purposes and techniques of closing argument are taught in courses on Trial Advocacy. The closing is often planned early in the trial planning process. The attorneys will integrate the closing with the overall case strategy through either a theme and theory or, with more advanced strategies, a line of effort. The prosecution should also state the main points and be sure to give their side of the argument and to be emotional.\n\n\n"}

A witness may have more or less credibility, or no credibility at all. In the common law system, the term 'credible witness' may be used generally, to refer to testimony, or for the witnessing of certain documents.\n\nSeveral factors affect witnesses' credibility. A credible witness is \"competent to give evidence, and is worthy of belief.\" Generally, a witness is deemed to be credible if they are recognized (or can be recognized) as a source of reliable information about someone, an event, or a phenomenon.\n\nIn a wide variety of cases that use the rules of evidence, testimony must be given by credible witnesses.\n\nIn Scottish law, a credible witness is one \"whose credibility commends itself to the presiding magistrate ... the trustworthiness\" of whom is good.\n\nIn English law, a credible witness is one who is \"not\" \"speaking from hearsay.\" In English:\nIn the United States, such a witness is \"more than likely to be true based on his/her experience, knowledge, training and appearance of honesty and forthrightness...\" Some factors for determining the credibility of testimony in U.S. courts include: (1) the witness had personal knowledge, (2) he or she was actually present at the scene, (3) the witness paid attention at the scene, and (4) he or she told the whole truth. The probative value of a credible witness is \"not\" a required element in any criminal case. However, credibility is always a factor in civil cases. The number of witnesses does \"not\" matter for credibility: \"The question for the jury is not which side has more witnesses, but what testimony they believe.\" Only the \"quality or power\" of believability matters. \n\nIn Australian law, the reliability of every witness in a criminal case must be taken into account.\n\nContesting the credibility of so-called \"expert\" witnesses rose into more common practice in the 1860s and 1870s.\n\nCredible witnesses must be used to give meaning or existence to certain types of documents, such as a last will and testament, codicil, apostille, deposition, interrogatories, certified document, or government record.\n\nFor example, in most common law jurisdictions, two or three witnesses must sign their names to the Will at the attestation clause below the testimonium clause that is executed by the testator. The exact number of witnesses depend on the state or local law. Under the English Statute of Wills of 1540, it was three witnesses. Under modern New York law, only two witnesses are required. In Canadian law, a credible witness to a Will \"means a witness not incapacitated by mental inbecility (sic), interest or crime.\"\n\nFor authentication of a document, a credible witness is needed whose major duty is identify, to a notary public, the signer of the document.\n\n\n"}

Typically, cross-border insolvency is more concerned with the insolvency of companies that operate in more than one country rather than bankruptcy of individuals. Like traditional conflict of laws rules, cross-border insolvency focuses upon three areas: choice of law rules, jurisdiction rules and enforcement of judgment rules. However, in relation to insolvency, the principal focus tends to be the recognition of foreign insolvency officials and their powers.\n\nThere are, broadly, three approaches to the administration of cross-border insolvency:\n\nThe universalist approach remains largely a holistic ideal and, for the most part, countries are divided into those with a purely territorial approach, and those that apply some form of hybrid approach.\n\nHistorically, most legal systems have developed on a territorial basis, and this is as true in relation to bankruptcy laws as other areas. However, from an early stage there have been piecemeal attempts to develop cross-border cooperation in insolvency matters. \n\nBut from a comparatively early stage common law jurisdictions recognised the desirability of ensuring that insolvency officers from different jurisdictions received the necessary support to enable the efficient administration of estates. Under English law one of the earliest recorded cases was \"Solomons v Ross\" (1764) 1 H Bl 131n. In that case a firm in the Netherlands was declared bankrupt and assignees were appointed. An English creditor had brought garnishee proceedings in England to attach certain sums owing to the Dutch firm but Bathurst J held that the bankruptcy had vested all the firm's assets (including debts owed by English debtors) in the Dutch assignees, and the English creditor had to surrender the fruits of the garnishee proceedings and prove in the Dutch bankruptcy. In \"Re African Farms\" 1906 TS 373 an English company with assets in the Transvaal Colony was in winding-up in England, and the Chief Justice of the Transvaal confirmed that the English liquidator would be recognised and that \"recognition which carries with it the active assistance of the court\", and that active assistance could include: \"A declaration, in effect, that the liquidator is entitled to deal with the Transvaal assets in the same way as if they were within the jurisdiction of the English courts, subject only to such conditions as the court may impose for the protection of local creditors, or in recognition of the requirements of our local laws.\" In \"Galbraith v Grimshaw\" [1910] AC 508 Lord Dunedin stated that there should be only one universal process of the distribution of a bankrupt's property and that, where such a process was pending elsewhere, the English courts should not let actions in its jurisdiction interfere with that process.\n\nHowever, the first significant developments in relation to cross-border insolvency regimes which were widely adopted were (1) the UNCITRAL Model Law, and (2) the EC Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings 2000.\n\nTwo current regimes for international insolvencies have been implemented on something wider than a regional basis: the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency, and the EC Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings 2000. Both regimes locate the \"centre of main interest\" (or \"COMI\") of the debtor.\n\nThe United Nations Commission on International Trade Law adopted a model law relating to cross-border insolvency on 30 June 1997. At present 46 jurisdictions have substantially implemented the Model Law into their domestic legislation, including a number of states with both significant economies and large volumes of cross border trade—such as the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada, as well as leading emerging economies such as Mexico and South Africa.\n\nThe basic concept of the Model Law is to establish what the \"main proceedings\" are in relation to any international insolvency. All other proceedings are referred to as the \"non-main proceedings\". The main proceedings are commenced where the debtor has its centre of main interest, or \"COMI\". Non-main proceedings may be commenced in any place where the debtor has a commercial establishment. The Model Law does not require reciprocity between states, but focuses upon (i) ensuring that states give assistance to insolvency officials from other countries in relation to main proceedings and non-main proceedings, and (ii) eliminating preferences for local creditors over international ones.\n\nThe following countries have substantially implemented the Model Law into their domestic legislation.\n\nThe EC Regulation on Insolvency Proceedings 2000 was passed on 29 May 2000 and came into effect on 31 May 2002. The EC Regulation, as its name applies, operates between member states of the European Union, and focuses upon creating a framework for the commencement of proceedings and for the automatic recognition and co-operation between the different member states. Unusually for a European regulation, the EC Insolvency Regulation does not seek to harmonise insolvency laws between the different member states.\n\nLike the UNCITRAL Model Law, the EC Regulation also employs the concept of a centre of main interest (or \"COMI\"). The definition of the COMI is left to member states in their implementation of the Regulation, but paragraph (13) of the preamble states: 'The \"centre of main interests\" should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of his interests on a regular basis and is therefore ascertainable by third parties.' If the COMI of an entity is outside of the European Union then the insolvency proceedings are not subject to the Regulation. In relation to companies there is a presumption that the registered office is the COMI of the company, but this presumption can be (and often is) rebutted.\n\nThe EC Regulation does not define insolvency, but it does define insolvency proceedings as \"...collective insolvency proceedings which entail the partial or total divestment of a debtor and the appointment of a liquidator.\" Article 3 divides proceedings into main proceedings and territorial proceedings. Main proceedings are accorded extraterritorial effect throughout the European Union. One of the concerns expressed in relation to the EC Regulation is that (other than a reference to the European Court of Justice) it provides no mechanism for determining which set of proceedings are the main proceedings if two or more jurisdictions claim their proceedings are the main proceedings.\n\nIn any attempt to harmonise or facilitate cross-border administration of insolvent companies, national insolvency regimes can take widely divergent approaches on certain key points:\n\n"}

{"id": "19477138", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19477138", "title": "Dropbox (service)", "text": "Dropbox (service)\n\nDropbox is a file hosting service operated by American company Dropbox, Inc., headquartered in San Francisco, California, that offers cloud storage, file synchronization, personal cloud, and client software. Dropbox was founded in 2007 by MIT students Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi as a startup company, with initial funding from seed accelerator Y Combinator.\n\nDropbox can create a special folder on the user's computer, the contents of which are then synchronized to Dropbox's servers and to other computers and devices that the user has installed Dropbox on, keeping the same files up-to-date on all devices. Dropbox uses a freemium business model, where users are offered a free account with a set storage size, with paid subscriptions available that offer more capacity and additional features. Dropbox Basic users are given 2 gigabytes of free storage space. Dropbox Plus users are given 1 terabyte of storage space, as well as additional features, including advanced sharing controls, remote wipe, and an optional Extended Version History add-on. Dropbox offers computer apps for Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS, and Linux computers, and mobile apps for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone smartphones and tablets. In March 2013, the company acquired Mailbox, a popular email app, and in April 2014, the company introduced Dropbox Carousel, a photo and video gallery app. Both Mailbox and Carousel were shut down in December 2015, with key features from both apps implemented into the regular Dropbox service. In October 2015, it officially announced Dropbox Paper, its collaborative document editor, in a reported effort to expand its operations towards businesses. As of March 2016, Dropbox has 500 million users.\nDropbox has received praise, including the Crunchie Award in 2010 for Best Internet Application, and \"Macworld\"`s 2009 Editor's Choice Award for Software. It has been ranked as one of the most valuable startups in the US and the world, with a valuation of over US$10 billion, and it has been described as one of Y Combinator's most successful investments to date. However, Dropbox has also experienced criticism and generated controversy for issues including security breaches and privacy concerns.\n\nDropbox has a five star privacy rating from the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nDropbox founder Drew Houston conceived the Dropbox concept after repeatedly forgetting his USB flash drive while he was a student at MIT. In a 2009 \"Meet the Team\" post on the Dropbox blog, he wrote that existing services at the time \"suffered problems with Internet latency, large files, bugs, or just made me think too much\". He began making something for his personal use, but then realized that it could benefit others with the same problems.\n\nHouston founded Evenflow, Inc. in May 2007 as the company behind Dropbox, and shortly thereafter secured seed funding from Y Combinator. Dropbox officially launched at 2008's TechCrunch Disrupt, an annual technology conference. Owing to trademark disputes between Proxy, Inc. and Evenflow, Dropbox's official domain name was \"\"get\"dropbox.com\" until October 2009, when it acquired its current domain, \"dropbox.com\". In October 2009, Evenflow, Inc. was renamed to Dropbox, Inc..\n\nIn an interview with \"TechCrunch\"s \"Founder Stories\" in October 2011, Houston explained that a demo video was released during Dropbox's early days, with one viewer being Arash Ferdowsi. Ferdowsi was \"so impressed\" that they formed a partnership. In regards to competition, Houston stated that \"It is easy for me to explain the idea, it is actually really hard to do it.\"\n\nDropbox has seen steady user growth since its inception. It surpassed the 1 million registered users milestone in April 2009, followed by 2 million in September, and 3 million in November. It passed 50 million users in October 2011, 100 million in November 2012, 200 million in November 2013, 400 million in June 2015, and 500 million in March 2016.\n\nIn July 2012, Dropbox acquired TapEngage, a startup that \"enables advertisers and publishers to collaborate on tablet-optimized advertising\". The following December, Dropbox acquired two companies; Audiogalaxy, a startup \"allowing users to store their music files and playlists in the cloud then stream them to any device\", and Snapjoy, a company that allowed users to \"aggregate, archive and view all of their digital photos from their cameras, phones and popular apps like Flickr, Instagram and Picasa, and then view them online or via an iOS app\". In July 2013, Dropbox acquired Endorse, a \"mobile coupon startup\".\n\nIn May 2014, Dropbox acquired Bubbli, a startup that has \"built some innovative ways of incorporating 3D technology into 2D views, and packaging it in a mobile app\".\n\nIn January 2015, Dropbox acquired CloudOn, a company that provided mobile applications for document editing and creation. At the same time, Dropbox told \"TechCrunch\" that CloudOn's base in Herzliya would become the first Dropbox office in Israel. In July, Dropbox acquired Clementine, an enterprise communication service.\n\nIn April 2014, Dropbox acquired photo-sharing company Loom (which would be shut down and integrated with the then-recently announced Carousel), and document-sharing startup Hackpad. Dropbox later announced in April 2017 that Hackpad would be shut down on July 19, with all notes being migrated to Dropbox Paper.\n\nDropbox has computer apps for Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS, and Linux computers, and mobile apps for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone smartphones and tablets. It also offers a website interface. As part of its partnership with Microsoft, Dropbox announced a universal Windows 10 app in January 2016.\n\nDropbox's apps offer an automatic photo uploading feature, allowing users to automatically upload photos or videos from cameras, tablets, SD cards, or smartphones to a dedicated \"Camera Uploads\" folder in their Dropbox. Users are given 500 megabytes of extra space for uploading their first photo, and are given up to 3 gigabytes of extra space if users continue using the method for more photos.\n\nIn July 2014, Dropbox introduced \"streaming sync\" for its computer apps. Streaming sync was described as a new \"supercharged\" synchronization speed for large files that improves the upload or download time by up to 2 times.\n\nIn August 2015, Dropbox announced the availability of \"Universal 2nd Factor\" USB security keys, providing two-factor authentication for logging into its services.\n\nDropbox received initial funding from seed accelerator Y Combinator. Dropbox also raised US$1.2 million in Series A funding from Sequoia Capital in 2007, that \"along with interest (on that amount) converted to equity as part of the Series A investment, which included a fresh slug of US$6 million\", bringing the total amount to US$7.25 million, with the round closed in 2008 and documents filed in 2009.\n\nA May 2010 report in \"The Wall Street Journal\" said that \"since [founder Drew Houston] started reading Eric Ries' Lean startup blog about a year ago, the company has started trickling out new features when they are ready instead of waiting to launch a fully featured product. That helps test customer appetite, he says, dubbing the practice \"minimum viable product\".\n\n\"TechCrunch\" reported in July 2011 that Dropbox had been looking to raise between US$200 and US$300 million, and had a valuation \"to end up in the $5 billion to $10 billion range. [...] quite a step up from its previous funding rounds which have totalled a tiny $7.2 million\". As noted in a \"Forbes\" article, Dropbox had \"revenue on track to hit $240 million in 2011\".\n\nIn April 2012, Dropbox announced that Bono and The Edge, two members of the Irish rock band U2, were individual investors in the company.\n\nIn March 2017, \"Bloomberg\" reported that Dropbox had secured a US$600 million credit line, with the company expected to file for its initial public offering (IPO) \"as soon as this year\".\n\nIn February 2018, Dropbox filed an IPO to be listed on the Nasdaq. The company's initial intent was to raise $500 million. Dropbox's stock rose 42 percent to $29.89 in its first day of trading on March 23, 2018. \n\nOn March 23, 2018 as investors raced to buy into the biggest innovation first sale of stock in over a year, Dropbox Inc.’s shares closed at $28.42, up in excess of 35 percent in their first day of trading on Friday. The stock opened at $29 on the NASDAQ and soared as much as 50 percent to a high of $31.60 in early trading. At the stock’s opening price, Dropbox had a market valuation of $12 billion, well above the $10-billion valuation it had in its last private funding round.\n\nAs of May 2018, Dropbox has never been profitable, but reports positive cash flow.\n\nDropbox uses a freemium business model, where users are offered a free account with a set storage size, with paid subscriptions available that offer more capacity and additional features.\n\nDropbox Basic users are given 2 gigabytes of free storage space. This can be expanded through referrals; users recommend the service to other people, and if those people start using the service, the user is awarded with additional 500 megabytes of storage space. Dropbox Basic users can earn up to 16 gigabytes through the referral program.\n\nThe Dropbox Plus subscription (named Dropbox Pro prior to March 2017) gives users 1 terabyte of storage space, as well as additional features, including:\n\nIn November 2013, Dropbox announced changes to \"Dropbox for Business\" that would enable users to connect both their personal Dropbox and their business Dropbox to the same device, with each of the folders being \"properly labeled for personal or work, and come with its own password, contacts, settings, and files\". Furthermore, Dropbox announced shared audit logs, remote wipe for business administrators, and account transfers, as new features of its Business offering. In January 2017, Dropbox introduced \"Smart Sync\" for Business and Enterprise customers, a feature that lets Windows and macOS users see all files in the Dropbox folder, but only download specific files on-demand.\n\nSimilarly to Dropbox Basic, Dropbox Plus users can also earn extra space through referrals. Plus users earn 1 gigabyte per referral, up to 32 gigabytes.\n\nDropbox Business is Dropbox's solution for corporations, adding more business-centered functionality for teams, including collaboration tools, advanced security and control, unlimited file recovery, user management and granular permissions, and options for unlimited storage. For large organizations, Dropbox offers Dropbox Enterprise, the \"highest tier\" of its product offerings, adding domain management tools, an assigned Dropbox customer support member, and help from \"expert advisors\" on deployment and user training.\n\nIn July 2016, Dropbox announced a new \"AdminX\" administrator dashboard for Business customers, offering improved control of company files and users. In June 2017, the AdminX dashboard was given a redesign and additional administrator functions, such as log-in durations, custom password strength parameters, and more granular subdomain verifications for specified teams.\n\nIn 2013, Samsung pre-loaded the Dropbox mobile application on its Android devices and Dropbox provided extra space for users owning Samsung's devices. In September 2012, Facebook and Dropbox integrated to allow users in Facebook Groups to share files using Dropbox. In November 2014, Dropbox announced a partnership with Microsoft to integrate Dropbox and Microsoft Office applications on iOS, Android and the Office 365 applications on the web.\nOn July 10, 2018, Dropbox announced its partnership with Salesforce aiming to improve brand engagement and team productivity. \n\nThe Dropbox software enables users to drop any file into a designated folder. The file is then automatically uploaded to Dropbox's cloud-based service and made available to any other of the user's computers and devices that also have the Dropbox software installed, keeping the file up-to-date on all systems. When a file in a user's Dropbox folder is changed, Dropbox only uploads the pieces of the file that have been changed, whenever possible.\n\nWhen a file or folder is deleted, users can recover it within 30 days. For Dropbox Plus users, this recovery time can be extended to one year, by purchasing an \"Extended Version History\" add-on.\n\nDropbox accounts that are not accessed or emails not replied in a year are automatically deleted.\n\nDropbox also offers a LAN sync feature, where, instead of receiving information and data from the Dropbox servers, computers on the local network can exchange files directly between each other, potentially significantly improving synchronization speeds.\n\nOriginally, the Dropbox servers and computer apps were written in Python. In July 2014, Dropbox began migrating its performance-critical backend infrastructure to Go.\n\nIn September 2012, Dropbox's website codebase was rewritten from JavaScript to CoffeeScript.\n\nDropbox originally used Amazon's S3 storage system to store user files, but between 2014 and 2016 they gradually moved away from Amazon to use their own hardware, referred to as \"Magic Pocket\", due to Dropbox's description as \"a place where you keep all your stuff, it doesn’t get lost, and you can always access it\". In June 2017, the company announced a major global network expansion, aiming to increase synchronization speeds while cutting costs. The expansion, starting with 14 cities across 7 countries on 3 continents, adds \"hundreds of gigabits of Internet connectivity with transit providers (regional and global ISPs), and hundreds of new peering partners (where we exchange traffic directly rather than through an ISP)\".\n\nDropbox uses SSL transfers for synchronization and stores the data via Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)-256 encryption.\n\nThe functionality of Dropbox can be integrated into third-party applications through an application programming interface (API).\n\nDropbox prevents sharing of copyrighted data, by checking the hash of files shared in public folders or between users against a blacklist of copyrighted material. This only applies to files or folders shared with other users or publicly, and not to files kept in an individual's Dropbox folder that are not shared.\n\nIn March 2013, Dropbox acquired Mailbox, a popular email app, with Mailbox CEO Gentry Underwood saying that \"Rather than grow Mailbox on our own, we've decided to join forces with Dropbox and build it out together\". Under the deal, the developers of Mailbox joined Dropbox, but kept Mailbox running as a stand-alone app. Mailbox CEO stated: \"We are still struggling to keep up with the demand from those who want to use it\", and Dropbox CEO Drew Houston said \"We felt we could help Mailbox reach a much different audience much faster\". The acquisition was reported to cost $100 million.\n\nIn December 2015, Dropbox announced the shut-down of Mailbox. In a blog post, Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi explained that \"We'll [...] be using what we've learned from Mailbox to build new ways to communicate and collaborate on Dropbox\".\n\nIn April 2014, Dropbox introduced Carousel, a photo and video gallery that \"combines the photos in your Dropbox with the photos on your phone, and automatically backs up new ones as you take them.\" Carousel sorted photos by event and date. In December 2015, Dropbox announced the shut-down of Carousel. In a blog post, Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi explained that \"We'll be taking key features from Carousel back to the place where your photos live - in the Dropbox app.\"\n\nIn April 2015, Dropbox launched a Dropbox Notes collaborative note-taking service in beta testing phase, prompting speculation if Dropbox was planning to bring out a product to compete with Google Docs. \"TechCrunch\" noted that Dropbox Notes appeared to be a new version of \"Project Composer\", a previous iteration of the service with roots from the acquisition of Hackpad in April 2014. In October 2015, Dropbox announced the upcoming launch of Dropbox Paper, its collaborative document editor, noted by the media as the result of its development of a Dropbox Notes service earlier in 2015. Dropbox Paper entered open beta in August 2016, allowing anyone to join and test the product. Mobile apps for Android and iOS were also released. In January 2017, Dropbox Paper was officially launched. Aimed for businesses, Dropbox Paper was described as \"one part online document, one part collaboration, one part task management tool, one part content hub\" by Rob Baesman, Dropbox's head of product, and allows for importing, editing, and collaboration on \"a number of other file types from Google, Microsoft, and others\".\n\nUsers have devised a number of uses for and mashups of the technology that expand Dropbox's functionality. These include: sending files to a Dropbox via Gmail; using Dropbox to sync instant messaging chat logs; BitTorrent management; password management; remote application launching and system monitoring; and as a free web hosting service.\n\nDropbox has received several awards, including the Crunchie Award in 2010 for Best Internet Application, and \"Macworld\"s 2009 Editor's Choice Award for Software.\n\nIt was nominated for a 2010 Webby Award, and for the 2010 Mac Design Awards by \"Ars Technica.\"\n\nIn 2011, \"Business Insider\" named Dropbox the world's sixth most valuable startup, and in 2017, the publication ranked Dropbox as the eighth most valuable US startup, with a valuation of $10 billion. It has been described as one of Y Combinator's most successful investments to date.\n\nDropbox's mobile iPhone app release in 2010 was among the top 10 \"best apps\" selected by Alex Ahlund, former CEO of two websites focused on mobile apps, and the company's Android app was also selected as one of the top five \"best apps\" in a list compiled in 2010 by Jason Hiner for \"ZDNet\".\n\nFounders Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi were named among the top 30 under 30 entrepreneurs by \"Inc.\" in 2011.\n\nIn January 2012, Dropbox was named startup of the year by \"TechCrunch\", and in 2016, the company was ranked #2 on the Forbes Cloud 100 list.\n\nDropbox has been the subject of criticism and controversy related to multiple incidents, including a June 2011 authentication problem that let accounts be accessed for several hours without passwords, a July 2011 Privacy Policy update with language suggesting Dropbox had ownership of users' data, concerns about Dropbox employee access to users' information, July 2012 email spam with recurrence in February 2013, leaked government documents in June 2013 with information that Dropbox was being considered for inclusion in the National Security Agency's PRISM surveillance program, a July 2014 comment from NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden criticizing Dropbox's encryption, the leak of 68 million account passwords on the Internet in August 2016, and a January 2017 accidental data restoration incident where years-old supposedly deleted files reappeared in users' accounts.\n\nThe Dropbox headquarters, located in San Francisco, were originally at Market Street, until its expansion to the China Basin Landing building in July 2011, allowing for a significant space increase. As the number of employees grew, the company again needed expansion, and in February 2014, it signed a lease for two buildings in Brannan Street. Not needing the substantial amounts of space after all, the company started shopping the remaining available space to other companies for sublease in November 2015.\n\nDropbox expanded into its second U.S. office in Austin, Texas in February 2014. The State of Texas and City of Austin provided a $1.7 million performance-based incentives package to Dropbox in exchange for locating their office in Austin.\n\nIn December 2012, Dropbox set up an office in Dublin, Ireland, its first office outside the United States.\n\n\n"}

A repatriation can be requested in three circumstances:\n\nIf the requested state has legislation outside of the Convention which allows for the repatriation of minors upon request, the Convention also allows repatriation in cases where the requesting state deems the minor's presence in the requested state to be incompatible with the interests of the minor or the interests of the requesting state.\n\nThe Convention was concluded in The Hague, Netherlands, on 28 May 1970.

Fishman and Geertz\" (Case No. CV 91-6426 (HLH (Tx) United States District Court for the Central District of California).\n\nThe affidavit contained criticisms of the Church of Scientology and substantial portions of the Operating Thetan auditing and course materials.\n\nThe documents were brought as exhibits attached to a declaration by Steven Fishman on 9 April 1993 as part of \"Church of Scientology International v. Fishman and Geertz\". Along with Kendrick Moxon and Laurie Bartilson, Timothy Bowles was one of the lead attorneys for the Church of Scientology in the case.\n\nFishman told the court that he had committed crimes on behalf of the Church. He also attested that he was assigned to murder his psychologist, Dr. Uwe Geertz, and then commit suicide.Fishman received a mail fraud conviction three years earlier, and he claimed being brainwashed by the Church and that he had committed the crime to cover the cost of his Scientology sessions. The court rejected Fishman’s defense and he was soon after sued for libel by Scientology.\n\nAs evidence, Fishman submitted course materials he said that he purchased from Ellie Bolger, a fellow Scientologist, and Richard Ofshe, an expert witness for his defense. The Church says the documents were stolen and considers them to be copyrighted and a trade secret. Among other materials, the affidavit contains 61 pages of the allegedly trade-secret and copyrighted story of Xenu.\n\nThe Fishman Affidavit contains much text from the old versions of the Operating Thetan levels. The versions of OT I to OT VII in the Fishman Affidavit are considered authentic as the church's Religious Technology Center (RTC) brought copyright lawsuits over their release on the Internet. Fishman's description of OT VIII contains the accusation that Jesus was a pedophile. After initially asserting copyright to all the OT level descriptions in the affidavit, RTC amended its claim to remove the OT VIII description, calling it a forgery. Fishman stated that he had obtained his copy of OT VIII from Ofshe, a different source than his copies of the other OT Levels, purchased from a fellow Scientologist.\n\nThe Church of Scientology dropped its libel case against Fishman and Geertz in 1994.\n\nAn important side aspect of the case was the fact that several high-ranking Scientology officials and lead attorneys for the organization and former high-ranking Scientologists submitted declarations on their activities for the Church of Scientology, giving thereby insight into the internal ongoings of the Scientology management.\n\nAmong others, declarations were submitted by:\n\n\nAlthough the Church of Scientology attempted to prevent others from receiving the document by continuously borrowing it, the text of this declaration and its exhibits were scanned, converted to text, and posted onto the Usenet newsgroup alt.religion.scientology by ex-Scientologist Arnie Lerma. The material was then placed on the World Wide Web by David S. Touretzky.\n\nLerma's newsgroup posting resulted in the August 1995 raid of his home for copyright violation on the materials, and the resulting lawsuit \"Religious Technology Center (Scientology) vs Arnaldo Lerma, Richard Leiby, and The Washington Post\". U.S. Federal Judge Leonie Brinkema ruled that while Richard Leiby and the Washington Post had not violated copyright, Lerma was liable and fined $2,500 but with no costs awarded to Scientology. Judge Brinkema also stated that the primary motivation for the case was \"to stifle criticism of Scientology in general and to harass its critics.\"\n\nAfter being posted to the newsgroup, the documents were mirrored on hundreds of websites worldwide. The Church of Scientology responded by suing a number of people and their Internet service providers for copyright infringement. The defendants responded by challenging the church to prove it was actually the copyright holder of the disputed documents.\n\nThe other notable case in connection with this was against Dutch writer Karin Spaink. The Church brought suit on copyright violation grounds for reproducing the source material, and claimed rewordings would reveal a trade secret. In 2003, Spaink won the case, with the court holding that her quotation of Scientology works was acceptable and expressing concern about Scientology's attempts to prevent discussion of its doctrines. The Church appealed but dropped the case after a negative advice on the appeal from the Attorney-General to the court in March 2005. In December 2005 the court dismissed the appeal, making the previous ruling final. The Church has no further possibility for appeal due to their dropping the case. The ruling also reversed earlier decisions affecting hyperlinking.\n\nCritics of the church have accused it of intentionally using lawsuits in these and other cases as SLAPP suits, intended to silence their opposition. Critics of Steven Fishman have produced the affidavit of Kenneth D. Long, a Scientology executive, which states that Fishman received services from a Scientology mission, did a few introductory courses, never worked for the Church or CCHR, and did not get any auditing or do any courses at the main Miami church, which would conflict with his claims. Vicki Aznaran, a former Scientologist who was involved in anti-Scientology litigation before retracting her claims as part of a settlement with Scientology, gave a declaration through Scientology attorneys in which she states various allegations made by Steven Fishman and other church critics are untrue, contradicting her previous declaration given in \"CSI v. Fishman and Geertz\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1373047", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1373047", "title": "History of the Jews under Muslim rule", "text": "History of the Jews under Muslim rule\n\nJewish communities have existed across the Middle East and North Africa since Antiquity. By the time of the Muslim conquests of the 7th century, these ancient communities had been ruled by various empires and included the Babylonian, Persian, Carthaginian, Greek, Roman, Byzantine, Ottoman and Yemenite Jews.\n\nJews under Islamic rule were given the status of dhimmi, along with certain other pre-Islamic religious groups. Though second-class citizens, these non-Muslim groups were nevertheless accorded certain rights and protections as \"people of the book\". During waves of persecution in Medieval Europe, many Jews found refuge in Muslim lands. For instance, Jews expelled from the Iberian Peninsula were invited to settle in various parts of the Ottoman Empire, where they would often form a prosperous model minority of merchants acting as intermediaries for their Muslim rulers.\n\nToday, Jews residing in Muslim countries have been reduced to a small fraction of their former sizes, with Iran and Turkey being home to the largest remaining Jewish populations.\n\nThere were, for a long but uncertain period, a significant number of Jews in Arabia. Historians claim that very large numbers of Jews – as many as 80,000 – arrived after the destruction of the First Temple, to join others already long-established in places such as the oasis of Khaybar as well as the trading colonies in Medina and Mecca (where they had their own cemetery). Another theory posits that these Jews were refugees from Byzantine persecutions. Arab historians mention some 20 Jewish communities, including two of Kohanim.\n\nThe Constitution of Medina, written shortly after hijra, addressed some points regarding the civil and religious situation for the Jewish communities living within the city from an Islamic perspective. For example, the constitution stated that the Jews \"will profess their religion, and the Muslims theirs\", and they \"shall be responsible for their expenditure, and the Muslims for theirs\". After the Battle of Badr, the Jewish tribe of Banu Qaynuqa breached treaties and agreements with Muhammad. Muhammad regarded this as casus belli and besieged the Banu Qaynuqa. Upon surrender the tribe was expelled. The following year saw the expulsion of the second tribe, the Banu Nadir, accused of planning to kill the prophet Muhammad. The third major Jewish tribe in Medina, Banu Qurayza was eliminated after betraying the Muslims during the Battle of the Trench. However, there were many Jewish communities in Medina who continued to live in Medina peacefully after these events such as Banu Awf, Banu Harith, Banu Jusham Banu Alfageer, Banu Najjar, Banu Sa'ida, and Banu Shutayba.\n\nIn year 20 of the Muslim era, or the year 641 AD, Muhammad's successor the Caliph Umar decreed that Jews and Christians should be removed from all but the southern and eastern fringes of Arabia—a decree based on the uttering of the Prophet: \"Let there not be two religions in Arabia\". The two populations in question were the Jews of the Khaybar oasis in the north and the Christians of Najran. Only the Red Sea port of Jeddah was permitted as a \"religious quarantine area\" and continued to have a small complement of Jewish merchants.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, Jewish people under Muslim rule experienced tolerance and integration. Some historians refer to this time period as the \"Golden Age\" for the Jews, as more opportunities became available to them. In the context of day-to-day life, Abdel Fattah Ashour, a professor of medieval history at Cairo University, states that Jewish people found solace under Islamic rule during the Middle Ages. The Muslim rule at times didn't fully enforce the Pact of Umar and the traditional Dhimmi status of Jews; i.e., the Jews sometimes, as in eleventh-century Granada, were not second-class citizens. Author Merlin Swartz referred to this time period as a new era for the Jews, stating that the attitude of tolerance led to Jewish integration into Arab-Islamic society.\n\nSocial integration allowed Jews to make great advances in new fields, including mathematics, astronomy, philosophy, chemistry and philology, with some even gaining political power under Islamic rule. For example, the vizier of Baghdad entrusted his capital to Jewish bankers, Jews were put in charge of certain parts of maritime and slave trade, and Siraf, the principal port of the caliphate in the 10th century, had a Jewish governor. Increased commercial freedom increased their integration into the Arab marketplace. Leon Poliakov writes that in the early ages of Islam, Jews enjoyed great privileges, and their communities prospered. No laws or social barriers restricted their commercial activities, and exclusive trade and craft guilds like those in Europe did not exist. Jews who moved to Muslim lands found themselves free to engage in any profession, resulting in less stigma than in Europe where such restrictions were still in force. This, coupled with more intense Christian persecution, encouraged many Jews to migrate to areas newly conquered by Muslims and establish communities there.\n\nAlthough Jewish life improved under Islamic rule, an interfaith utopia did not exist. Jews still experienced persecution. Under Islamic Rule, the Pact of Umar was introduced, which protected the Jews but also established them as inferior. Since the 11th century, there have been instances of pogroms against Jews. Examples include the 1066 Granada massacre, the razing of the entire Jewish quarter in the Andalucian city of Granada. In North Africa, there were cases of violence against Jews in the Middle Ages, and in other Arab lands including Egypt, Syria and Yemen Beginning in the 15th century, the Moroccan Jewish population was confined to segregated quarters known as mellahs. In cities, these were surrounded by walls and a fortified gateway. Rural \"mellahs\", however, were separate villages inhabited solely by Jews. The Almohads, who had taken control of much of Islamic Iberia by 1172, were far more fundamentalist in outlook than the Almoravides, and they treated the \"dhimmis\" harshly. Jews and Christians were expelled from Morocco and Islamic Spain. Faced with the choice of either death or conversion, some Jews, such as the family of Maimonides, fled south and east to more tolerant Muslim lands, while others went northward to settle in the growing Christian kingdoms. In 1465, Arab mobs in Fez slaughtered thousands of Jews, leaving only 11 alive, after a Jewish deputy vizier treated a Muslim woman in an offensive manner. The killings touched off a wave of similar massacres throughout Morocco.\n\nHistorian Mark R. Cohen proposes a comparative approach to understanding Jewish life under Islamic rule, noting that Jews in Islamic lands often experienced less physical violence than Jews under Western Christendom. He posits that Muslims considered Jews less theologically threatening than Christians did, suggesting that the Christians wanted to establish a separate religious identity from Judaism, from which their faith split and diverged. According to him, instances of persecution were occasional, more the exception than the rule, and claims of systemic persecution at the hands of Muslim rulers are myths created to bolster political propaganda. The situation where Jews in the Muslim world both enjoyed cultural and economic prosperity at times, but were widely persecuted there at other times, was summarised by G. E. Von Grunebaum:\n\nIt would not be difficult to put together the names of a very sizable number of Jewish subjects or citizens of the Islamic area who have attained to high rank, to power, to great financial influence, to significant and recognized intellectual attainment; and the same could be done for Christians. But it would again not be difficult to compile a lengthy list of persecutions, arbitrary confiscations, attempted forced conversions, or pogroms.\n\nJews have lived in Asia Minor for more than 2,400 years. Originally settling in Asia Minor in the Hellenistic era, they were expelled by Byzantines between the 5th and 11th centuries, resettling there only after the conquest of much of Anatolia by Muslim Seljuk forces after the Battle of Manzikert. Jewish communities grew and thrived under the Seljuks, and later also under Ottoman rule, making it a safe haven for Jews fleeing from persecution elsewhere.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire served as a refuge for Jewish refugees from Spanish empire, especially after the fall of Muslim Spain in 1492 and Edict of Expulsion. This continued through the Roman Catholic Inquisition, as secret Jews and forced converts continued to flee Spain. The Maghreb from North Africa similarly found refuge among the Ottomans, as large Arabian cities created their own restrictive Jewish quarters (\"Mellahs\").\nIn 1834, in Safed, Ottoman Syria, local Muslim Arabs carried out a massacre of the Jewish population known as the Safed Plunder.\n\nIn 1840, the Jews of Damascus were falsely accused of having murdered a Christian monk and his Muslim servant and of having used their blood to bake Passover bread. A Jewish barber was tortured until he \"confessed\"; two other Jews who were arrested died under torture, while a third converted to Islam to save his life. Throughout the 1860s, the Jews of Libya were subjected to what Gilbert calls punitive taxation. In 1864, around 500 Jews were killed in Marrakech and Fez in Morocco. In 1869, 18 Jews were killed in Tunis, and an Arab mob on Jerba Island looted and burned Jewish homes, stores, and synagogues. In 1875, 20 Jews were killed by a mob in Demnat, Morocco; elsewhere in Morocco, Jews were attacked and killed in the streets in broad daylight. In 1897, synagogues were ransacked and Jews were murdered in Tripolitania.\n\nJews lived in Kurdistan for thousands of years, before the final and mass migration in 1951-1952 to Israel. The Jews lived under the Ottoman Empire and under the Persian Empire for many years and following World War I, they lived mainly in Iraq, Iran and Turkey, some lived in Syria. Jews lived in many Kurdish urban centers such as Aqra, Dohuk, Arbil, Zakho, Sulaimaniya, Amadia, in Southern Kurdistan, in Saqiz, Bana and Ushno, in Eastern Kurdistan, in Jezira, Nisebin, Mardin and Diyarbakır in Turkey and in Qamishle in North-Western Syria. Jews lived as well in hundreds of villages in the rural and tribal area of Kurdistan, usually one or two families in a village, where they worked as weavers of traditional Kurdish clothing or as tenants of the \"agha\", the landlord or head of the village.\n\nIn 1656, all Jews were expelled from Isfahan and forced to convert to Islam because of a common belief that their Jewishness was impure. However, as it became known that the converts continued to practice Judaism in secret and because the treasury suffered from the loss of \"jizya\" collected from the Jews, in 1661 they were allowed to revert to Judaism, although they were still required to wear a distinctive patch on their clothing.\n\nIn 1839, in the eastern Persian city of Meshed, a mob burst into the Jewish Quarter, burned the synagogue, and destroyed the Torah scrolls. The Jews themselves were violently forced to convert, narrowly avoiding complete massacre. There was another massacre in Barfurush in 1867. In 1839, the Allahdad incident, the Jews of Mashhad, Iran, now known as the Mashhadi Jews, were coerced into converting to Islam.\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century, J. J. Benjamin wrote of Persian Jews: \"…they are obliged to live in a separate part of town…; for they are considered as unclean creatures… Under the pretext of their being unclean, they are treated with the greatest severity and should they enter a street, inhabited by Mussulmans, they are pelted by the boys and mobs with stones and dirt… For the same reason, they are prohibited to go out when it rains; for it is said the rain would wash dirt off them, which would sully the feet of the Mussulmans… If a Jew is recognized as such in the streets, he is subjected to the greatest insults. The passers-by spit in his face, and sometimes beat him… unmercifully… If a Jew enters a shop for anything, he is forbidden to inspect the goods… Should his hand incautiously touch the goods, he must take them at any price the seller chooses to ask for them... Sometimes the Persians intrude into the dwellings of the Jews and take possession of whatever please them. Should the owner make the least opposition in defense of his property, he incurs the danger of atoning for it with his life... If... a Jew shows himself in the street during the three days of the Katel (Muharram)…, he is sure to be murdered.\"\n\nA number of groups of Persian Jews have split off since ancient times, to the extent that they are now recognized as separate communities, such as the Bukharian Jews and Mountain Jews.\n\nConfined to city quarters, the Bukharan Jews were denied basic rights and many were forced to convert to Islam. They had to wear black and yellow dress to distinguish themselves from the Muslims.\n\nUnder the Zaydi rule, discriminatory laws became more severe against the Yemenite Jews, which culminated in their eventual exile, in what later became known as the Exile of Mawza. They were considered to be impure, and therefore forbidden to touch a Muslim or a Muslim's food. They were obligated to humble themselves before a Muslim, to walk to the left side, and greet him first. They could not build houses higher than a Muslim's or ride a camel or horse, and when riding on a mule or a donkey, they had to sit sideways. Upon entering the Muslim quarter a Jew had to take off his foot-gear and walk barefoot. If attacked with stones or fists by Islamic youth, a Jew was not allowed to defend himself. In such situations he had the option of fleeing or seeking intervention by a merciful Muslim passerby.\n\nBy the mid 1970s the vast majority of Jews had left, fled or had been expelled from Arab and Muslim-majority countries, moving primarily to Israel, France and the United States. The reasons for the exodus are varied and disputed. In 1945, there were between 758,000 and 866,000 Jews living in communities throughout the Arab world. Today, there are fewer than 8,000. In some Arab states, such as Libya, which once had a Jewish population of around 3 percent, similar to that of the United States today), the Jewish community no longer exists; in other Arab countries, only a few hundred Jews remain.\n\nThe largest communities of Jews in Muslim countries exist in the non-Arab countries of Iran and Turkey; both, however, are much smaller than they historically have been. Among Arab countries, the largest Jewish community now exists in Morocco with about 2,000 Jews and in Tunisia with about 1,000.\n\nJudaism is the second-oldest religion still existing in Iran after Zoroastrianism. By various estimates, between 8,000 and 10,000 Jews remain in Iran, mostly in Tehran and Hamedan. About one-third of the some 120,000-150,000 Iranian Jews in the mid-20th century fled the country during the 1950s, as a consequence of political instability. Most of the remaining 80,000-100,000 Jews fled during and following the Islamic Revolution of 1979.\n\nToday, the largest groups of Persian Jews are found in Israel (236,000-360,000 in 2014, including second-generation Israelis) and the United States (45,000, especially in the Los Angeles area, home to a large concentration of expatriate Iranians). There are also smaller communities in Western Europe.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11754230", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11754230", "title": "Intelligence-led policing", "text": "Intelligence-led policing\n\nIntelligence-led policing (ILP) is a policing model built around the assessment and management of risk. Intelligence officers serve as guides to operations, rather than operations guiding intelligence.\n\nCalls for intelligence-led policing originated in the 1990s, both in Britain and in the United States. In the U.S., Mark Riebling's 1994 book Wedge - The Secret War between the FBI and CIA spotlighted the conflict between law enforcement and intelligence, and urged cops to become \"more like spies.\" Intelligence-led policing gained considerable momentum globally following the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States. It is now advocated by the leading police associations in North America and the UK.\n\nAlthough intelligence-led policing builds on earlier paradigms, such as community policing, problem-oriented policing, and the partnership model of policing, it originated as a rejection of the \"reactive\" focus on crime of community policing, with calls for police to spend more time employing informants and surveillance to combat recidivist offenders.\n\nRecently, intelligence-led policing has undergone a 'revisionist' expansion to allow incorporation of reassurance and neighbourhood policing.\n\nPrior to intelligence-led policing, a responsive strategy was the main method of policing. However, as crime was perceived to outgrow police resources in the UK, there was a demand gap, and a call for a new strategy that would more efficiently use the resources available at the time \n\nEarly development of intelligence-led policing took place in the UK. It was perceived that police were spending too much time responding to specific incidents, and not tackling the problem of repeat offenders. Therefore, reports by the Audit Commission in 1993 and Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary in 1997 advocated increased use of intelligence, surveillance and informants to target recidivist offenders, so that police could be more effective in fighting crime. The call was quickly taken up by some police forces, particularly the Kent Constabulary.\nIntelligence led policing was not a major proponent of policing styles until the September 11th terrorist attacks. Prior to these attacks the majority of all branches of the government would often not divulge any information to each other.\nThe main assumptions of this theory can be described by Ratcliffe’s 3i format. As shown by the figure below,the three I’s call for close cooperation between police chiefs and intelligence analysts in order to facilitate a strategy that will impact the criminal environment.\n\nFigure 1. 3i Model of Intelligence-led Policing adapted from Ratcliffe\n\nOftentimes the intelligence in intelligence led policing is seen as the gathering of information, however the process does not start or begin there. The National Criminal Intelligence Sharing Plan (NCISP) which was introduced in 2003 contained 28 recommendations for major changes to policing and a process of collecting data. NCISP is a process of intelligence, also known as the intelligence cycle. Intelligence is seen as information that has been gathered and analyzed. This can be done through computer software but usually that only simplifies data, instead to be considered intelligence it must be analyzed by a trained analyst.\n\nCamden, New Jersey was once considered one of the most violent cities in the world. This was attributed to the large amount of violent crimes that were reported in the city. The large amount of violent crime was attributed to the disputed \"gang corners\". On these gang corners, rival gangs would often dispute territory boundaries of where they could sell drugs. A study found that the majority of crime took place in areas that had multiple gangs. Through interviews with police officers, the study also found that their focus was more on gang activity, rather than the location of said activity. Therefore, in order to change the environment, the police department of Camden would use a \"location denial strategy\", where a police officer would be placed in these locations until they were no longer disputed.\n\nIntelligence-led policing in the UK has been applied as a specialized police practice involving the identification and targeting of high-rate, chronic offenders, and devising strategic interventions based on that intelligence. ILP originated as a problem-oriented strategy in Northern Ireland (Royal Ulster Constabulary) and was adopted by the Kent and Northumbria Constabularies in combating motor vehicle theft and other property crime.\n\nKent prioritized its calls for service, placing less priority on minor service calls, and referring them to other agencies, in order to provide police with more time to focus on the property crimes. Rather than reactively responding to individual incidents, a systematic analysis of offenses was conducted, which showed that a small number of offenders were responsible for a disproportionately large number of motor vehicle thefts in the area, as well as identifying repeat victims and problem areas. Using this knowledge to formulate a response, the automobile theft rate dropped significantly. Since 2000, ILP has been enshrined in Britain as the philosophy underpinning the National Intelligence Model.\n\nIntelligence-led policing gained its momentum in the 1970s, when the National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals announced that every law enforcement agency should immediately create system for gathering and analyzing data. However, agencies were not governed by policies and violated many civil liberties, resulting in many agencies shutting down their intelligence functions by court order or voluntarily.\n\nIn 1976, standards and policies were introduced to address the abuses that had taken place. These stated that an individual had to meet certain criminal criteria in order to be entered into intelligence files. In the 1980s, Regional Information Sharing Systems (RISS) Centers, a sharing system, were introduced throughout the nation to collect and store data on criminals.\n\nThe post-9/11 environment in the US, the \"era of Homeland Security\" for American policing, has increased demands for law enforcement to build global partnerships and to work more closely with local agencies to expand the capacity of the state to fight both crime and terrorism. Owing to the belief held by some that 9/11 and other terrorist attacks could have been prevented if not for intelligence failures, a key difference between intelligence-led policing and earlier strategies is that intelligence is no longer considered a specialized function for crime analysts or intelligence units.\n\nInvestigations following bombings of the rail systems in Madrid and London and the arrest of suspected terrorists in Canada, Britain, and Florida suggested that intelligence culled from a variety of sources may be the key to identifying suspects and successfully intervening to prevent attacks.\n\nOn March 16, 2005, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff outlined a risk-based approach to homeland security threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences when he said, \"Risk management must guide our decision-making as we examine how we can best organize to prevent, respond, and recover from an attack . . . . Our strategy is, in essence, to manage risk in terms of these three variables – threat, vulnerability, consequence. We seek to prioritize according to these variables, to fashion a series of preventive and protective steps that increase security at multiple levels.\"\n\nIn 2006, Mark Riebling of the Center for Policing Terrorism published a doctrine on Intelligence-Led Policing. Riebling's model leverages both Israeli counter-terrorist tactics, and the NYPD's Broken Windows policing theories. Among the Broken Windows mechanisms, Riebling's doctrine blends problem solving, environmental design, community policing, and public-private partnerships. Analyzing the operations of the Israeli National Police in Tel Aviv, Riebling notes approvingly that \"investigation of the incident, even a traffic accident, is secondary to the number one goal—which is gathering intelligence. \"For instance, when they raided a bordello, where the patrons were primarily Arabs from different parts of the region, Israeli police were less concerned about the criminal activity, than with preparing intelligence reports on who these people were, and how they got into Israel.\"\n\nIn its current conceptualization, intelligence-led policing is envisioned as a tool for information sharing both within law enforcement agencies and between all participants in the community, private sector, intelligence community, and public government. The concept aids law enforcement agencies in identifying threats and developing responses to prevent those threats from reaching fruition in America’s communities. There is no universally accepted definition of ILP, although the components of most definitions are the same or at least similar.\n\nThe collection and analysis of information related to crime and conditions that contribute to crime, resulting in an actionable intelligence product intended to aid law enforcement in developing tactical responses to threats and/or strategic planning related to emerging or changing threats.\n\nResearchers have argued that, while the British experience with ILP has provided an important foundation for U.S. initiatives, there are \"important differences in legacy and functional responsibilities that limit the wholesale adoption of the British model in the United States. Among those limitations has been the array of post-9/11 federal standards for the American law enforcement intelligence process, including the new dimension of homeland security intelligence. One of the differences between the British model and the U.S. model is that of balancing American constitutional rights, and the act of gathering intelligence.\" Although the implementation of ILP is expected to be difficult for most U.S. law enforcement agencies, Carter and Carter argue that the experiences and foundation of CompStat and community policing serve as important springboards for success. Although there are substantive differences in the concepts, the similarities serve as reliable policy experiences to make implementation of ILP a functional reality\" (p. 322)\n\nIn the Canadian context, the lineage of intelligence-led policing can be traced to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police’s failure to prevent the 1985 bombing of Air India flight 182. Post-event analysis concluded that if the RCMP had had a better relationship with the Sikh community in Vancouver, they might have acquired actionable intelligence alerting them to the plot by extremists looking to establish an independent Sikh state in the Punjab region of India.\n\nThis was an impetus for the adoption of community policing, but it was soon realized that the focus on “community” was a distraction in that hardened targets are not easily penetrated through better police-community relations; rather, it is the “mode of information that is important.” Consequently, the RCMP developed its CAPRA model (Clients, Analysis, Partnerships, Response, Assessment), which fits with, and has been re-cast as, intelligence-led policing.\n\nNew Zealand has been experimenting with intelligence-led policing since the 1990s and has implemented it throughout the New Zealand Police, which is the national police organization in the country of New Zealand. Intelligence-led policing is encouraged throughout the districts of the New Zealand Police, and is implemented throughout the country and is an implementation of intelligence-led policing throughout an entire country. One of the results of this experiment is that there was little sharing of information between districts in New Zealand. In the New Zealand study there were problems both organizational and behavioral that hindered the results of either using the information or gathering the information to make intelligence based decisions. The New Zealand Police are now implementing more aspects of problem-oriented policing to their intelligence-led policing system.\n\nILP is often viewed as a management tool instead of a crime reduction strategy. Jerry Ratcliffe claims ten benefits of the use of intelligence led policing: \n\nHe argues that these all help prevent crime by creating a police force that is more efficient with its resources. There is also a growing recognition within policing that external agencies may hold the key to long-term crime reduction. These agencies, such as local councils, housing authorities, and health and education departments, are believed to have a greater potential to impact a wider range of causal factors. As agencies share information amongst each other, a larger \"network of intelligence\" is created, which proponents hope, when used effectively, will cause a substantial decrease in crime.\n\nIntelligence-led policing is still in its early stages, and therefore lacks a universal conceptual framework that can be applied to disparate contexts as a policing paradigm. Implementation can also be difficult, because it requires police managers to “have faith in the intelligence process and in the judgments and recommendations of their intelligence staff.”\n\nSome have also questioned whether the foundational ingredient - intelligence - has been properly considered, given that police and security professionals already have to contend with “information overload” from the huge databanks that have been built up in the intelligence process, and that increasing raw data is not the same as generating “knowledge” or actionable intelligence.\n\nAs intelligence-led policing represents a move towards surveillance, it focuses on information collection and analyzing data. However, the way that this data is collected is a concern for privacy advocates. The United States Supreme Court has not made any particular decisions in relation to searches that deal specifically with intelligence-led policing. The cases that do cover most searches, such as \"Mapp v. Ohio\" (1961) and \"Terry v. Ohio\" (1968), were decided prior to the implementation of intelligence-led policing. The question arises with intelligence-led policing of when a search has occurred. The U.S. Supreme Court has given a two part test to determine a search in \"Katz v. United States\" (1967). The first is an expectation of privacy, and the second is that the expectation of privacy should be reasonable. The issue exists in what type of privacy expectation an individual can hope to have with technology.

{"id": "19195965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19195965", "title": "Iroquois", "text": "Iroquois\n\nThe Iroquois ( or ) or Haudenosaunee () (People of the Longhouse) are a historically powerful northeast Native American confederacy. They were known during the colonial years to the French as the Iroquois League, and later as the Iroquois Confederacy, and to the English as the Five Nations, comprising the Mohawk, Onondaga, Oneida, Cayuga, and Seneca. After 1722, they accepted the Tuscarora people from the Southeast into their confederacy and became known as the Six Nations.\n\nThe Iroquois have absorbed many other peoples into their tribes as a result of warfare, adoption of captives, and by offering shelter to displaced peoples. Culturally all are considered members of the clans and tribes into which they are adopted by families.\n\nThe historic St. Lawrence Iroquoians, Wyandot (Huron), Erie, and Susquehannock, all independent peoples, also spoke Iroquoian languages. In the larger sense of linguistic families, they are often considered Iroquoian peoples because of their similar languages and cultures, all culturally and linguistically descended from the Proto-Iroquoian people and language; however, they were traditionally enemies of the nations in the Iroquois League. In addition, Cherokee is an Iroquoian language. The Cherokee people are believed to have migrated south from the Great Lakes area in ancient times, settling in the backcountry of the Southeast United States, including what is now Tennessee.\n\nIn 2010, more than 45,000 enrolled Six Nations people lived in Canada, and about 80,000 in the United States.\n\nThe most common name for the confederacy, Iroquois, is of somewhat obscure origin. The first time it appears in writing is in the account of Samuel de Champlain of his journey to Tadoussac in 1603, where it occurs as \"Irocois\". Other spellings appearing in the earliest sources include \"Erocoise\", \"Hiroquois\", \"Hyroquoise\", \"Irecoies\", \"Iriquois\", \"Iroquaes\", \"Irroquois\", and \"Yroquois\", as the French transliterated the term into their own phonetic system. In the French spoken at the time, this would have been pronounced as [irokwe] or [irokwɛ]. Over the years, several competing theories have been proposed for this name's ultimate origin—the earliest such proposal is by the Jesuit priest Pierre François Xavier de Charlevoix, who wrote in 1744:\n\nThe name Iroquois is purely French, and is formed from the [Iroquoian-language] term \"Hiro\" or \"Hero\", which means \"I have said\"—with which these Indians close all their addresses, as the Latins did of old with their \"dixi\"—and of \"Koué\", which is a cry sometimes of sadness, when it is prolonged, and sometimes of joy, when it is pronounced shorter.\nIn 1883, Horatio Hale wrote that the Charlevoix etymology was dubious, and that \"no other nation or tribe of which we have any knowledge has ever borne a name composed in this whimsical fashion\". Hale suggested instead that the term came from Huron, and was cognate with Mohawk \"ierokwa\" \"they who smoke\" or Cayuga \"iakwai\" \"a bear\". J.N.B. Hewitt responded to Hale's etymology in 1888 by expressing doubt that either of those words exist in the respective languages. His preferred etymology at the time was from Montagnais \"irin\" \"true, real\" and \"ako\" \"snake\", plus the French \"-ois\" suffix, though he later revised his theory to state that the source was Algonquin \"Iriⁿakhoiw\". However, none of these etymologies gained widespread acceptance. By 1978 Ives Goddard could write: \"No such form is attested in any Indian language as a name for any Iroquoian group, and the ultimate origin and meaning of the name are unknown.\"\n\nA more modern etymology is that advocated by Gordon M. Day in 1968, who elaborates upon an earlier etymology given by Charles Arnaud in 1880. Arnaud had claimed that the word came from Montagnais \"irnokué\", meaning \"terrible man\", via the reduced form \"irokue\". Day proposes a hypothetical Montagnais phrase \"irno kwédač\", meaning \"a man, an Iroquois\", as the origin of this term. For the first element \"irno\", Day cites cognates from other attested Montagnais dialects: \"irinou\", \"iriniȣ\", and \"ilnu\"; and for the second element \"kwédač\" he suggests a relation to \"kouetakiou\", \"kȣetat-chiȣin\", and \"goéṭètjg\" – names used by neighboring Algonquian tribes to refer to the Iroquois, Hurons, and Laurentians.\n\nMore recently, Peter Bakker has proposed a Basque origin for \"Iroquois\". Basque fishermen and whalers are known to have frequented the waters of the Northeast in the 1500s, so much so that a Basque-based pidgin developed for communication with the Algonquian tribes of the region. Bakker claims that it is unlikely that \"-quois\" derives from a root specifically used to refer to the Iroquois, citing as evidence that several other Indian tribes of the region were known to the French by names terminating in the same element, e.g. \"Armouchiquois\", \"Charioquois\", \"Excomminquois\", and \"Souriquois\". He proposes instead that the word derives from \"hilokoa\" (via the intermediate form \"irokoa\"), from the Basque roots \"hil\" \"to kill\", \"ko\" (the locative genitive suffix), and \"a\" (the definite article suffix). In favor of an original form beginning with /h/, Bakker cites alternate spellings such as \"hyroquois\" sometimes found in documents from the period, and the fact that in the Southern dialect of Basque, the word \"hil\" is pronounced \"il\". He also argues that the /l/ was rendered as /r/ since the former is not attested in the phonemic inventory of any language in the region (including Maliseet, which developed an /l/ later). Thus the word according to Bakker is translatable as \"the killer people\". It is similar to other terms used by Eastern Algonquian tribes to refer to their enemy the Iroquois, which translate as \"murderers\".\n\nThe Five Nations historically referred to themselves by a different autonym, Haudenosaunee, meaning \"People of the Longhouse\". It is also occasionally preferred by scholars of Native American history, who consider the name \"Iroquois\" to be derogatory in origin. This name derives from two phonetically similar but etymologically distinct words in the Seneca language: \"Hodínöhšö:ni:h\", meaning \"those of the extended house,\" and \"Hodínöhsö:ni:h\", meaning \"house builders\". The name \"Haudenosaunee\" first appears in English in Lewis Henry Morgan (1851), where it is written as \"Ho-dé-no-sau-nee\". The spelling \"Hotinnonsionni\" is also attested from later in the nineteenth century. An alternate designation, Ganonsyoni, is occasionally encountered as well. This term derives from the Mohawk \"kanǫhsyǫ́·ni\" (\"the extended house\"), or from a cognate expression in a related Iroquoian language, and is frequently encountered in earlier sources variously spelled \"Kanosoni\", \"akwanoschioni\", \"Aquanuschioni\", \"Cannassoone\", \"Canossoone\", \"Ke-nunctioni\", or \"Konossioni\". More transparently, the Iroquois confederacy is also often referred to simply as the Six Nations (or, for the period before the entry of the Tuscarora in 1722, the Five Nations). The word is Rotinonsionni in the Mohawk language.\n\nThe Iroquois Confederacy is believed to have been founded by the Peacemaker in 1142, bringing together five distinct nations in the southern Great Lakes area into \"The Great League of Peace\". Each nation within this Iroquoian confederacy had a distinct language, territory, and function in the League. Iroquois influence at the peak of its power extended into present-day Canada, westward along the Great Lakes and down both sides of the Allegheny mountains into present-day Virginia and Kentucky and into the Ohio Valley.\n\nThe League is governed by a Grand Council, an assembly of fifty chiefs or sachems, each representing one of the clans of one of the nations.\n\nThe original Iroquois League (as the French knew them) or Five Nations (as the British knew them), occupied large areas of present-day New York State up to the St. Lawrence River, west of the Hudson River, and south into northwestern Pennsylvania. From east to west, the League was composed of the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca nations. In or close to 1722, the Tuscarora tribe joined the League, having migrated from the Carolinas after being displaced by Anglo-European settlement. Also an Iroquoian-speaking people, the Tuscarora were accepted into what became the Six Nations.\n\nOther independent Iroquoian-speaking peoples, such as the Erie, Susquehannock, Huron (Wendat) and Wyandot, lived at various times along the St. Lawrence River, and around the Great Lakes. In the American Southeast, the Cherokee were an Iroquoian-language people who had migrated to that area centuries before European contact. None of these was part of the Haudenosaunee. Those on the borders of Haudenosaunee territory in the Great Lakes region competed and warred with the member nations.\n\nWhen Europeans first arrived in North America, the Haudenosaunee were based in what is now the northeastern United States, primarily in what is referred to today as Central New York and Western New York, west of the Hudson River and through the Finger Lakes region, and upstate New York along the St. Lawrence River area downstream to today's Montreal.\n\nFrench, Dutch and British colonists in both New France (Canada) and the what became the Thirteen Colonies recognized a need to gain favor with the Iroquois people, who occupied a significant portion of lands west of colonial settlements. Their first relations with them were for fur trading, which was favorable and became lucrative to both sides. The colonists also sought to establish positive relations to secure their settlement borders.\n\nFor nearly 200 years the Iroquois were a powerful factor in North American colonial policy-making decisions. Alignment with Iroquois offered political and strategic advantages to the European colonies, but the Iroquois preserved considerable independence. Some of their people settled in mission villages along the St. Lawrence River, becoming more closely tied to the French. While they participated in French raids on Dutch and later English settlements, where some Mohawk and other Iroquois settled, in general the Iroquois resisted attacking their own peoples.\n\nThe Iroquois remained a politically unique, undivided, large Native American polity up until the American Revolution. The League kept its treaty promises to the British Crown. But when the British were defeated, they ceded the Iroquois territory without consultation; many Iroquois had to abandon their lands in the Mohawk Valley and elsewhere and relocate in the northern lands retained by the British. The Crown gave them land in compensation for the 5 million acres they had lost in the south, but it was not equivalent to earlier territory.\n\nThe Iroquois League has also been known as the \"Iroquois Confederacy\". Modern scholars distinguish between the League and the Confederacy. According to this interpretation, the Iroquois League refers to the ceremonial and cultural institution embodied in the Grand Council, while the Iroquois Confederacy is the decentralized political and diplomatic entity that emerged in response to European colonization. According to that theory, \"The League\" still exists. The Confederacy dissolved after the defeat of the British and allied Iroquois nations in the American Revolutionary War. Today's Iroquois/Six Nations people do not make any distinction between \"The League\" and \"the Confederacy\" and use the terms interchangeably, preferring the name Haudenosaunee Confederacy.\n\nAfter the defeat of the British, they ceded most of the Iroquois territory to the United States, without bringing their allies to the negotiating table. Many of the Iroquois migrated to Canada, forced out of New York because of hostility to the British allies in the aftermath of a fierce war. Those remaining in New York were required to live mostly on reservations. In 1784, a total of 6,000 Iroquois had to confront 240,000 New Yorkers, with land-hungry New Englanders poised to migrate west. \"Oneidas alone, who were only 600 strong, owned six million acres, or about 2.4 million hectares. Iroquoia was a land rush waiting to happen.\"\n\nIn addition to the major cessions of Iroquois land, the Oneida and others who gained reservations in New York faced increasing pressures for their lands. By the War of 1812, they had lost control of considerable property.\n\nThe League has since been compared to a modern-day example of anarcho-communism or libertarian socialism.\n\nKnowledge of Iroquois history stems from Haudenosaunee oral tradition, archaeological evidence, accounts from Jesuit missionaries, and subsequent European historians. Historian Scott Stevens credits the early modern European value for the written word over oral tradition and cultures as contributing to a prejudiced, racialized element within writings about the Iroquois that continued into the 19th century. The historiography of the Iroquois peoples is a topic of much debate, especially regarding the American colonial period.\n\nJesuit accounts of the Iroquois portrayed them as savages because of comparisons to French culture; the Jesuits perceived them to lack government, law, letters, and religion. But the Jesuits made considerable effort to study their languages and cultures, and some came to respect them. A major problem with contemporary European sources from the 17th and 18th centuries, both French and British, was that Europeans, coming from a patriarchal society, did not understand the matrilineal kinship system of Iroquois society and the related power of women. The Canadian historian D. Peter MacLeod, writing about the relationship between the Canadian Iroquois and the French in the time of the Seven Years' War, said: \nMost critically, the importance of clan mothers, who possessed considerable economic and political power within Canadian Iroquois communities, was blithely overlooked by patriarchal European scribes. Those references that do exist, show clan mothers meeting in council with their male counterparts to take decisions regarding war and peace and joining in delegations to confront the \"Onontio\" [the Iroquois term for the French governor-general] and the French leadership in Montreal, but only hint at the real influence wielded by these women\".\n\nEighteenth-century English historiography focuses on the diplomatic relations with the Iroquois, supplemented by such images as John Verelst's \"Four Mohawk Kings\", and publications such as the Anglo-Iroquoian treaty proceedings printed by Benjamin Franklin. One historical narrative persistent in the 19th and 20th centuries casts the Iroquois as \"an expansive military and political power ... [who] subjugated their enemies by violent force and for almost two centuries acted as the fulcrum in the balance of power in colonial North America\". Historian Scott Stevens noted that the Iroquois themselves began to influence the writing of their history in the 19th century, including Joseph Brant (Mohawk), and David Cusick (Tuscarora). John Arthur Gibson (Seneca, 1850–1912) was an important figure of his generation in recounting versions of Iroquois history in epics on the Peacemaker. Notable women historians among the Iroquois emerged in the following decades, including Laura \"Minnie\" Kellog (Oneida, 1880–1949) and Alice Lee Jemison (Seneca, 1901–1964).\n\nThe Iroquois League was established prior to European contact, with the banding together of five of the many Iroquoian peoples who had emerged south of the Great Lakes. \nReliable sources link the origins of the Iroquois confederacy to 1142 and an agricultural shift when corn was adopted as a staple crop. Many archaeologists and anthropologists believe that the League was formed about 1450. Arguments have been made for an earlier date. \nOne theory argues that the League formed shortly after a solar eclipse on August 31, 1142, an event thought to be expressed in oral tradition about the League's origins. They subsequently created a highly egalitarian society. One British colonial administrator declared in 1749 that the Iroquois had \"such absolute Notions of Liberty that they allow no Kind of Superiority of one over another, and banish all Servitude from their Territories.\"\n\nAnthropologist Dean Snow argues that the archaeological evidence does not support a date earlier than 1450. He has said that recent claims for a much earlier date \"may be for contemporary political purposes\". In contrast, other scholars note that at the time when anthropological studies were made, researchers consulted only male informants, although the Iroquois people had distinct oral traditions held by males and females. Thus half of the historical story, that told by women, was lost. For this reason, origin tales tend to emphasize Deganawidah and Hiawatha, while the role of Jigonsaseh largely remains unknown because this part of the oral history was held by women.\n\nAccording to oral traditions, the League was formed through the efforts of two men and one woman. They were Dekanawida, sometimes known as the Great Peacemaker, Hiawatha, and Jigonhsasee, known as the \"Mother of Nations\", whose home acted as a sort of United Nations. They brought the Peacemaker's message, known as the Great Law of Peace, to the squabbling Iroquoian nations, who were fighting, raiding and feuding with one another and other tribes, both Algonkian and Iroquoian. Five nations originally joined as the League, giving rise to the many historic references to Five Nations of the Iroquois or as often, just The Five Nations. With the addition of the southern Tuscarora in the 18th century, these original five tribes are the ones that still compose the Haudenosaunee in the early 21st century: the Mohawk, Onondaga, Oneida, Cayuga, and Seneca.\nOther Iroquoian-language peoples, including the populous Wyandot (Huron), with related social organization and cultures, became extinct as tribes as a result of disease and war. They did not join the League when invited and were much reduced after the Beaver Wars and high mortality from Eurasian infectious diseases. While the First Nations and Native Americans sometimes tried to remain neutral in the various colonial frontier wars, some also allied with one nation or another, through the French and Indian War. The Six Nations were split in their alliances between the French and British in that war, the North American front of the Seven Years' War. In warfare the tribes were decentralized, and often bands acted independently.\n\nAccording to legend, an evil Onondaga chieftain named Tadodaho was the last converted to the ways of peace by The Great Peacemaker and Hiawatha. He was offered the position as the titular chair of the League's Council, representing the unity of all nations of the League. This is said to have occurred at Onondaga Lake near present-day Syracuse, New York. The title \"Tadodaho\" is still used for the League's chair, the fiftieth chief who sits with the Onondaga in council.\n\nWith the formation of the League, internal conflicts were minimized. The council of fifty thereafter ruled on disputes, seeking consensus in their decisions. Raids within the member tribes ended, and they directed warfare against competitors. This allowed the Iroquois to increase in numbers while their rivals declined. The political cohesion of the Iroquois rapidly became one of the strongest forces in 17th- and 18th-century northeastern North America. The confederacy did not speak for all five tribes, which continued to act independently. But about 1678, the council exerted more power in negotiations with the colonial governments of Pennsylvania and New York. Thereafter, the editors of American Heritage write the Iroquois became very adroit at playing the French off against the British, as individual tribes had played the Swedes, Dutch, and English. The editors of \"American Heritage\" magazine suggest the Iroquois spokesmen were as politically sophisticated as many a modern politician.\n\nAs has been noted above, other Iroquoian-language peoples were encountered by early European colonists. While the tribes raided each other, they also traded with the members of the Iroquois who were nearby. The explorer Robert La Salle in the 17th century identified the Mosopelea as among the Ohio Valley peoples defeated by the Iroquois in the early 1670s. The Erie and peoples of the upper Allegheny valley declined earlier during the Beaver Wars. By 1676 the Susquehannock were known to be broken as a power from the effects of three years of epidemic disease, war with the Iroquois, and frontier battles, as settlers took advantage of the weakened tribe.\n\nAccording to one theory of early Iroquois history, after becoming united in the League, the Iroquois invaded the Ohio River Valley in the territories that would become the eastern Ohio Country down as far as present-day Kentucky to seek additional hunting grounds. They displaced about 1200 Siouan-speaking tribepeople of the Ohio River valley, such as the Quapaw (Akansea), Ofo (Mosopelea), and Tutelo and other closely related tribes out of the region. These tribes migrated to regions around the Mississippi River and the piedmont regions of the east coast.\n\nIn \"Reflections in Bullough's Pond\", historian Diana Muir argues that the pre-contact Iroquois were an imperialist, expansionist culture whose cultivation of the corn/beans/squash agricultural complex enabled them to support a large population. They made war primarily against neighboring Algonquian peoples. Muir uses archaeological data to argue that the Iroquois expansion onto Algonquian lands was checked by the Algonquian adoption of agriculture. This enabled them to support their own populations large enough to have sufficient warriors to defend against the threat of Iroquois conquest. The People of the Confederacy dispute whether any of this historical interpretation relates to the League of the Great Peace which they contend is the foundation of their heritage.\nThe Iroquois may be the \"Kwedech\" described in the oral legends of the Mi'kmaq nation of Eastern Canada. These legends relate that the Mi'kmaq in the late pre-contact period had gradually driven their enemies – the \"Kwedech\" – westward across New Brunswick, and finally out of the Lower St. Lawrence River region. The Mi'kmaq named the last-conquered land \"Gespedeg\" or \"last land,\" from which the French derived \"Gaspé\". The \"Kwedech\" are generally considered to have been Iroquois, specifically the Mohawk; their expulsion from Gaspé by the Mi'kmaq has been estimated as occurring c. 1535–1600.\n\nAround 1535, Jacques Cartier reported Iroquoian-speaking groups on the Gaspé peninsula and along the St. Lawrence River. Archeologists and anthropologists have defined the St. Lawrence Iroquoians as a distinct and separate group (and possibly several discrete groups), living in the villages of Hochelaga and others nearby (near present-day Montreal), which had been visited by Cartier. By 1608, when Samuel de Champlain visited the area, that part of the St. Lawrence River valley had no settlements, but was controlled by the Mohawk as a hunting ground. The fate of the Iroquoian people that Cartier encountered remains a mystery, and all that can be stated for certain is when Champlain arrived, they were gone. On the Gaspé peninsula, Champlain encountered Algonquian-speaking groups. The precise identity of any of these groups is still debated. On 29 July 1609, Champlain assisted his allies in defeating a Mohawk war party by the shores of what is now called Lake Champlain, and again in June 1610, Champlain fought against the Mohawks.\n\nThe Iroquois became well known in the southern colonies in the 17th century by this time. After the first English settlement in Jamestown, Virginia (1607), numerous 17th-century accounts describe a powerful people known to the Powhatan Confederacy as the \"Massawomeck\", and to the French as the \"Antouhonoron\". They were said to come from the north, beyond the Susquehannock territory. Historians have often identified the \"Massawomeck / Antouhonoron\" as the Haudenosaunee.\n\nIn 1649, an Iroquois war party, consisting mostly of Senecas and Mohawks, destroyed the Huron village of Wendake. In turn, this ultimately resulted in the breakup of the Huron nation. With no northern enemy remaining, the Iroquois turned their forces on the Neutral Nations on the north shore of Lakes Erie and Ontario, the Susquehannocks, their southern neighbor. Then they destroyed other Iroquoian-language tribes, including the Erie, to the west, in 1654, over competition for the fur trade. Then they destroyed the Mohicans. After their victories, they reigned supreme in an area from the Mississippi River to the Atlantic Ocean; from the St. Lawrence River to the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nAt that time the Iroquois numbered about 10,000, insufficient to offset the European immigration of up to 100,000 people a year. They had become victims of their own success.\n\nThe Five Nations of the League established a trading relationship with the Dutch at Fort Orange (modern Albany, New York), trading furs for European goods, an economic relationship that profoundly changed their way of life and led to much over-hunting of beavers.\n\nBetween 1665 and 1670, the Iroquois established seven villages on the northern shores of Lake Ontario in present-day Ontario, collectively known as the \"Iroquois du Nord\" villages. The villages were all abandoned by 1701.\n\nOver the years 1670–1710, the Five Nations achieved political dominance of much of Virginia west of the Fall Line and extending to the Ohio River valley in present-day West Virginia and Kentucky. As a result of the Beaver Wars, they pushed Siouan-speaking tribes out and reserved the territory as a hunting ground by right of conquest. They finally sold the British colonists their remaining claim to the lands south of the Ohio in 1768 at the Treaty of Fort Stanwix.\n\nBeginning in 1609, the League engaged in a decades-long series of wars, the so-called Beaver Wars, against the French, their Huron allies, and other neighboring tribes, including the Petun, Erie, and Susquehannock. Trying to control access to game for the lucrative fur trade, they put great pressure on the Algonquian peoples of the Atlantic coast (the Lenape or Delaware), the Anishinaabe peoples of the boreal Canadian Shield region, and not infrequently fought the English colonies as well. During the Beaver Wars, they were said to have defeated and assimilated the Huron (1649), Petun (1650), the Neutral Nation (1651), Erie Tribe (1657), and Susquehannock (1680). The traditional view is that these wars were a way to control the lucrative fur trade in order to access European goods on which they had become dependent.\n\nRecent scholarship has elaborated on this view, arguing that the Beaver Wars were an escalation of the \"Mourning Wars\", which were an integral part of early Iroquoian culture. This view suggests that the Iroquois launched large-scale attacks against neighboring tribes in order to avenge or replace the massive number of deaths resulting from battles or smallpox epidemics.\n\nIn 1628, the Mohawk defeated the Mahican to gain a monopoly in the fur trade with the Dutch at Fort Orange (present-day Albany), New Netherland. The Mohawk would not allow northern native peoples to trade with the Dutch. By 1640, there were almost no beavers left on their lands, forcing the Iroquois to play the role of the middlemen in the fur trade, as Indian peoples to the west and north possessed the beavers with the thick pelts that the Europeans would pay the best price for. In 1645, a tentative peace was forged between the Iroquois and the Huron, Algonquin, and French.\n\nIn 1646, Jesuit missionaries at Sainte-Marie among the Hurons went as envoys to the Mohawk lands to protect the fragile peace of the time. Mohawk attitudes toward the peace soured while the Jesuits were traveling, and their warriors attacked the party en route. The missionaries were taken to the village of \"Ossernenon\" (near present-day Auriesville, New York), where the moderate Turtle and Wolf clans recommended setting the priests free. Angered, members of the Bear clan killed Jean de Lalande, and Isaac Jogues on October 18, 1646. The Catholic Church has commemorated the two French priests and Jesuit lay Brother René Goupil (killed 29 September 1642) as among the eight North American Martyrs.\n\nIn 1649 during the Beaver Wars, the Iroquois used recently purchased Dutch guns to attack the Huron, who were allied with the French. These attacks, primarily against the Huron towns of Taenhatentaron (St. Ignace) and St. Louis in what is now Simcoe County, Ontario were the final battles that effectively destroyed the Huron Confederacy. The Jesuit missions in Huronia on the shores of Georgian Bay were abandoned in the face of the Iroquois attacks with the Jesuits leading the surviving Hurons east towards the French settlements on the St. Lawrence. The Jesuit \"Relations\" expressed some amazement that the Five Nations had been able to dominate the area \"for five hundred leagues around, although their numbers are very small\". From 1651 to 1652, the Iroquois attacked the Susquehannock, located to their south in present-day Pennsylvania, without sustained success.\n\nIn the early 17th century, the Iroquois Confederacy was at the height of its power, with a total population of about 12,000 people. In 1653 the Onondaga Nation extended a peace invitation to New France. An expedition of Jesuits, led by Simon Le Moyne, established Sainte Marie de Ganentaa in 1656 in their territory. The Jesuits were forced to abandon the mission by 1658 as hostilities resumed, possibly because of the sudden death of 500 native people from an epidemic of smallpox, a European infectious disease to which they had no immunity.\n\nFrom 1658 to 1663, the Iroquois were at war with the Susquehannock and their Lenape and Province of Maryland allies. In 1663, a large Iroquois invasion force was defeated at the Susquehannock main fort. In 1663, the Iroquois were at war with the Sokoki tribe of the upper Connecticut River. Smallpox struck again, and through the effects of disease, famine, and war, the Iroquois were under threat of extinction. In 1664, an Oneida party struck at allies of the Susquehannock on Chesapeake Bay.\n\nIn 1665, three of the Five Nations made peace with the French. The following year, the Governor-General of New France, the Marquis de Tracy, sent the Carignan regiment under to confront the Mohawk and the Oneida. The Mohawk avoided battle, but the French burned their villages, referred to as \"castles\" by the French, and crops. In 1667, the remaining two Iroquois Nations signed a peace treaty with the French and agreed to allow their missionaries to visit their villages. The French Jesuit missionaries were known as the \"black-robes\" to the Iroquois, who began to urge that Catholic converts should relocate to the village of Caughnawga outside of Montreal. This treaty lasted for 17 years.\n\nAround 1670, the Iroquois drove the Siouan-speaking Mannahoac tribe out of the northern Virginia Piedmont region. They began to claim ownership of the territory by right of conquest. In 1672, the Iroquois were defeated by a war party of Susquehannock. The Iroquois appealed to the French for support and asked Governor Frontenac to assist them against the Susquehannock.\n\nSome old histories state that the Iroquois defeated the Susquehannock during this time period. As no record of a defeat has been found, historians have concluded that no defeat occurred. In 1677, the Iroquois adopted the majority of the Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannock into their nation. In January 1676, the Governor of New York colony, Edmund Andros, sent a letter to the chiefs of the Iroquois asking for their help in King Philip's War as the English colonists in New England were having much difficulty fighting the Wampanoag under the leadership of Metacom. In exchange for guns from the English, which the Iroquois greatly valued, an Iroquois war party launched a devastating raid on the Wampanoag in February 1676, destroying villages and with them, supplies of food while taking many prisoners.\n\nBy 1677, the Iroquois formed an alliance with the English through an agreement known as the Covenant Chain. By 1680, the Iroquois Confederacy was in a strong position, having eliminated the Susquehannock and the Wampanoag, taken vast number of captives to increase the size of their population, and had secured an alliance with the English that guaranteed supplies of guns and ammunition. Together the allies battled to a standstill the French, who were allied with the Huron. These Iroquoian people had been a traditional and historic foe of the Confederacy. The Iroquois colonized the northern shore of Lake Ontario and sent raiding parties westward all the way to Illinois Country. The tribes of Illinois were eventually defeated, not by the Iroquois, but by the Potawatomi.\n\nIn 1679, the Susquehannock, with Iroquois help, attacked Maryland's Piscataway and Mattawoman allies. Peace was not reached until 1685. During the same period, French Jesuit missionaries were active in Iroquoia, which led to a voluntary mass relocation of many Haudenosaunee to the St. Lawrence valley at Kahnawake and Kanesatake near Montreal. It was the intention of the French to use the Catholic Haudenosaunee in the St. Lawrence valley as a buffer to keep the Haudenosaunee allied with the English living in what is now upstate New York away from Montreal, the center of the French fur trade. The attempts of both the English and the French to use their Haudenosaunee allies for their own purposes were foiled as the two groups of Haudenosaunee showed a \"profound reluctance to kill one another\". Following the move of the Catholic Iroquois to the St. Lawrence valley, historians commonly describe the Iroquois living outside of Montreal as the Canadian Iroquois while the Iroquois who remained in the historical heartland of Iroquoia in modern upstate New York are described as the League Iroquois.\n\nIn 1684, the governor of New France, Joseph-Antoine Le Febvre de La Barre, decided to launch a punitive expedition against the Seneca, who were attacking French and Algonquian fur traders in the Mississippi river valley, and asked for the Catholic Haudenosaunee to contribute men for his expedition. La Barre's expedition ended in fiasco in September 1684 when influenza broke out among the \"troupes de la Marine\" while the Canadian Iroquois warriors refused to fight, instead only engaging in verbal battles as they exchanged insults with the Seneca warriors. King Louis XIV of France was not amused when he heard of La Barre's failure, which led him to sack La Barre as governor of New France, and sent as his replacement Jacques-René de Brisay de Denonville, Marquis de Denonville, Governor of New France from 1685 to 1689, who arrived in August with orders from the king to crush the Haudenosaunee confederacy. The Sun King had instructed Denonville to ensure that the \"grandeur\" of France be respected even in the remote woods of North America.\n\nIn 1687, the Marquis de Denonville set out for Fort Frontenac (modern Kingston, Ontario) with a well-organized force. In July 1687 Denonville took with him on his expedition a mixed force of \"troupes de la Marine\", French-Canadian militiamen, and 353 Indian warriors from the Jesuit mission settlements, of which 220 were Haudenosaunee. They met with 50 hereditary sachems from the Onondaga council fire, who came under a flag of truce in what on the north shore of Lake Ontario in what is now southern Ontario. Denonville recaptured the fort for New France and seized, chained, and shipped the 50 Iroquois chiefs to Marseilles, France, to be used as galley slaves. Several of the Catholic Haudenosaunee were outraged at the way in which French enslaved a diplomatic party that had come under the flag of truce and had enslaved all of the Cayuga people living in several villages on the north shore of Lake Ontario, which led to least 100 of them to desert to the Seneca. Denonville justified enslaving the people he encountered, saying that as an \"civilized European\" he did not respect the customs of \"savages\" and would do as he liked with them. On 13 August 1687, an advance party of French soldiers walked into a Seneca ambush and were nearly killed to a man; however the Seneca had mistaken the advance party for the main French force and fled when the main French force came up. The remaining Catholic Haudenosaunee warriors refused orders from Denonville to pursue the retreating Seneca.\n\nDenonville ravaged the land of the Seneca, landing a French armada at Irondequoit Bay, striking straight into the seat of Seneca power, and destroying many of its villages. Fleeing before the attack, the Seneca moved farther west, east and south down the Susquehanna River. Although great damage was done to the Seneca homeland, the Senecas' military might was not appreciably weakened. The Confederacy and the Seneca developed an alliance with the English who were settling in the east. The destruction of the Seneca land infuriated the members of the Iroquois Confederacy. On August 4, 1689, they retaliated by burning to the ground Lachine, a small town adjacent to Montreal. Fifteen hundred Iroquois warriors had been harassing Montreal defenses for many months prior to that.\n\nThey finally exhausted and defeated Denonville and his forces. His tenure was followed by the return of Frontenac, who succeeded Denonville as Governor for the next nine years (1689–1698). Frontenac had been arranging a new plan of attack to lessen the effects of the Iroquois in North America. Realizing the danger of continuing to hold the sachems, he located the 13 surviving leaders of the 50 originally taken and returned with them to New France in October 1689. In 1690, Frontenac destroyed the village of Schenectady and in 1693 Frontenac burned down three Mohawk villages and took 300 prisoners.\n\nIn 1696, Frontenac decided to take the field against the Iroquois, although at this time he was seventy-six years of age. Frontenac decided to target the Oneida and Onondaga this time, instead of the Mohawk whom were the favorite enemies of the French. On July 6, he left Lachine at the head of a considerable force and traveled to the village of the Onondaga, where he arrived a month later. With support from the French, the Algonquian nations drove the Iroquois out of the territories north of Lake Erie and west of present-day Cleveland, Ohio, regions which they had conquered during the Beaver Wars. In the meantime, the Iroquois had abandoned their villages. As pursuit was impracticable, the French army commenced its return march on August 10. Under Frontenac's leadership, the Canadian militia became increasingly adept at guerrilla warfare, taking the war into Iroquois territory and attacking a number of English settlements. The Iroquois never threatened the French colony again.\n\nDuring King William's War (North American part of the War of the Grand Alliance), the Iroquois were allied with the English. In July 1701, they concluded the \"Nanfan Treaty\", deeding the English a large tract north of the Ohio River. The Iroquois claimed to have conquered this territory 80 years earlier. France did not recognize the validity of the treaty, as it had settlements in the territory at that time and the English had virtually none. Meanwhile, the Iroquois were negotiating peace with the French; together they signed the Great Peace of Montreal that same year.\n\nAfter the 1701 peace treaty with the French, the Iroquois remained mostly neutral. During the course of the 17th century, the Iroquois had acquired a fearsome reputation among the Europeans, and it was the policy of the Six Nations to use this reputation to play off the French against the British in order to extract the maximum amount of material rewards. In 1689, the English Crown provided the Six Nations goods worth £100 in exchange for help against the French, in the year 1693 the Iroquois had received goods worth £600, and in the year 1701 the Six Nations had received goods worth £800.\n\nDuring Queen Anne's War (North American part of the War of the Spanish Succession), they were involved in planned attacks against the French. Peter Schuyler, mayor of Albany, arranged for three Mohawk chiefs and a Mahican chief (known incorrectly as the Four Mohawk Kings) to travel to London in 1710 to meet with Queen Anne in an effort to seal an alliance with the British. Queen Anne was so impressed by her visitors that she commissioned their portraits by court painter John Verelst. The portraits are believed to be the earliest surviving oil portraits of Aboriginal peoples taken from life.\nIn the first quarter of the 18th century, the Iroquoian-speaking Tuscarora fled north from the pressure of British colonization of North Carolina and intertribal warfare; they had been subject to having captives sold into Indian slavery. They petitioned to become the sixth nation of the Iroquois Confederacy. This was a non-voting position, but they gained the protection of the Haudenosaunee.\n\nThe Iroquois program toward the defeated tribes favored assimilation within the 'Covenant Chain' and Great Law of Peace, over wholesale slaughter. Both the Lenni Lenape, and the Shawnee were briefly tributary to the Six Nations, while subjected Iroquoian populations emerged in the next period as the Mingo, speaking a dialect like that of the Seneca, in the Ohio region. During the War of Spanish Succession, known to Americans as \"Queen Anne's War\", the Iroquois remained neutral, through leaning towards the British. Anglican missionaries were active with the Iroquois and devised a system of writing for them.\nIn 1721 and 1722, Lt. Governor Alexander Spotswood of Virginia concluded a new Treaty at Albany with the Iroquois, renewing the Covenant Chain and agreeing to recognize the Blue Ridge as the demarcation between the Virginia Colony and the Iroquois. But, as European settlers began to move beyond the Blue Ridge and into the Shenandoah Valley in the 1730s, the Iroquois objected. Virginia officials told them that the demarcation was to prevent the Iroquois from trespassing \"east\" of the Blue Ridge, but it did not prevent English from expanding \"west.\" Tensions increased over the next decades, and the Iroquois were on the verge of going to war with the Virginia Colony. In 1743, Governor Gooch paid them the sum of 100 pounds sterling for any settled land in the Valley that was claimed by the Iroquois. The following year at the Treaty of Lancaster, the Iroquois sold Virginia all their remaining claims in the Shenandoah Valley for 200 pounds in gold.\n\nDuring the French and Indian War (the North American theater of the Seven Years' War), the League Iroquois sided with the British against the French and their Algonquian allies, who were traditional enemies. The Iroquois hoped that aiding the British would also bring favors after the war. Few Iroquois warriors joined the campaign. By contrast, the Canadian Iroquois supported the French.\n\nIn 1711, refugees from is now southern-western Germany known as the Palatines appealed to the Iroquois clan mothers for permission to settle on their land. By spring of 1713, about 150 Palatine families had leased land from the Iroquois. The Iroquois taught the Palatines how to grow \"the Three Sisters\" as they called their staple crops of beans, corn and squash and where to find edible nuts, roots and berries. In return, the Palatines taught the Iroquois how to grow wheat and oats, and how to use iron ploughs and hoes to farm. As a result of the money earned from land rented to the Palatines, the Iroquois elite gave up living in longhouses and started living in European style houses, having an income equal to a middle-class English family. By the middle of the 18th century, a multi-cultural world had emerged with the Iroquois living alongside German and Scots-Irish settlers. The settlements of the Palatines were intermixed with the Iroquois villages. In 1738, an Irishman, William Johnson, who was successful as a fur trader, settled with the Iroquois. Johnson who become very rich from the fur trade and land speculation, learned the languages of the Iroquois while bedding as many of their women as possible, and become the main intermediary between the British and the League. In 1745, Johnson was appointed the Northern superintendent of Indian Affairs, formalizing his position.\n\nOn 9 July 1755, a force of British Army regulars and the Virginia militia under General Edward Braddock advancing into the Ohio river valley was almost completely destroyed by the French and their Indian allies at the Battle of the Monongahela. Johnson, who had the task of enlisting the League Iroquois on the British side, led a mixed Anglo-Iroquois force to victory at Lac du St Sacrement, known to the British as Lake George. In the Battle of Lake George, a group of Catholic Mohawk (from \"Kahnawake\") and French forces ambushed a Mohawk-led British column; the Mohawk were deeply disturbed as they had created their confederacy for peace among the peoples and had not had warfare against each other. Johnson attempted to ambush a force of 1,000 French troops and 700 Canadian Iroquios under the command of Baron Dieskau, who beat off the attack and killed the old Mohawk war chief, Peter Hendricks. On 8 September 1755, Diskau attacked Johnson's camp, but was repulsed with heavy losses. Though the Battle of Lake George was a British victory, the heavy losses taken by the Mohawk and Oneida at the battle caused the League to declare neutrality in the war. Despite Johnson's best efforts, the League Iroquois remained neutral for next several years, and a series of French victories at Oswego, Louisbourg, Fort William Henry and Fort Carillon ensured the League Iroquois would not fight on what appeared to be the losing side.\n\nIn February 1756, the French learned from a spy, Oratory, an Oneida chief, that a British were stockpiling supplies at the Oneida Carrying Place, a crucial portage between Albany and Oswego to support an offensive in the spring into what is now Ontario. As the frozen waters melted south of Lake Ontario on average two weeks before the waters did north of Lake Ontario, the British would be able to move against the French bases at Fort Frontenac and Fort Niagara before the French forces in Montreal could come to their relief, which from the French perspective necessitated a preemptive strike at the Oneida Carrying Place in the winter. To carry out this strike, the Marquis de Vaudreuil, the Governor-General of New France, assigned the task to Gaspard-Joseph Chaussegros de Léry, an officer of the \"troupes de le Marine\", who required and received the assistance of the Canadian Iroquois to guide him to the Oneida Carrying Place. The Canadian Iroquois joined the expedition, which left Montreal on 29 February 1756 on the understanding that they would only fight against the British, not the League Iroquois, and they would not be assaulting a fort.\n\nOn 13 March 1756, an Oswegatchie Indian traveler informed the expedition that the British had built two forts at the Oneida Carrying Place, which caused the majority of the Canadian Iroquois to want to turn back, as they argued the risks of assaulting a fort would mean too many casualties, and many did in fact abandon the expedition. On 26 March 1756, Léry's force of \"troupes de le Marine\" and French-Canadian militiamen, who had not eaten for two days, received much needed food when the Canadian Iroquois ambushed a British wagon train bringing supplies to Fort William and Fort Bull. As far as the Canadian Iroquois were concerned, the raid was a success as they captured 9 wagons full of supplies and took 10 prisoners without losing a man, and for them, engaging in a frontal attack against the two wooden forts as Léry wanted to do was irrational. The Canadian Iroquois informed Léry \"if I absolutely wanted to die, I was the master of the French, but they were not going to follow me\". In the end, about 30 Canadian Iroquois reluctantly joined Léry's attack on Fort Bull on the morning of 27 March 1756, when the French and their Indian allies stormed the fort, finally smashing their way in through the main gate with a battering ram at noon. Of the 63 people in Fort Bull, half of whom were civilians, only 3 soldiers, one carpenter and one woman survived the Battle of Fort Bull as Léry reported \"I could not restrain the ardor of the soldiers and the \"Canadians\". They killed everyone they encountered\". Afterwards, the French destroyed all of the British supplies and Fort Bull itself, which secured the western flank of New France. On the same day, the main force of the Canadian Iroquois ambushed a relief force from Fort William coming to the aid of Fort Bull, and did not slaughter their prisoners as the French did at Fort Bull; for the Iroquois, prisoners were very valuable as they increased the size of the tribe.\n\nThe crucial difference between the European and First Nations way of war was that Europe had millions of people, which meant that British and French generals were willing to see thousands of their own men die in battle in order to secure victory as their losses could always be made good; by contrast, the Iroquois had a considerably smaller population, and could not afford heavy losses, which could cripple a community. The Iroquois custom of \"Mourning wars\" to take captives who would become Iroquois reflected the continual need for more people in the Iroquois communities. Iroquois warriors were brave, but would only fight to the death if necessary, usually to protect their women and children; otherwise, the crucial concern for Iroquois chiefs was always to save manpower. The Canadian historian D. Peter MacLeod wrote that the Iroquois way of war was based on their hunting philosophy, where a successful hunter would bring down an animal efficiently without taking any losses to his hunting party, and in the same way, a successful war leader would inflict losses on the enemy without taking any losses in return.\n\nThe Iroquois only entered the war on the British side again in late 1758 after the British took Louisbourg and Fort Frontenac. At the Treaty of Fort Easton in October 1758, the Iroquois forced the Lenape and Shawnee who had been fighting for the French to declare neutrality. In July 1759, the Iroquois helped Johnson take Fort Niagara. In the ensuing campaign, the League Iroquois assisted General Jeffrey Amherst as he took various French forts by the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence valley as he advanced towards Montreal, which he took in September 1760. The British historian Michael Johnson wrote the Iroquois had \"played a major supporting role\" in the final British victory in the Seven Years' War. In 1763, Johnson left his old home of Fort Johnson for the lavish estate, which he called Johnson Hall, which become a center of social life in the region. Johnson was close to two white families, the Butlers and the Croghans, and three Mohawk families, the Brants, the Hills, and the Peters.\n\nAfter the war, to protect their alliance, the British government issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763, forbidding Anglo-European (white) settlements beyond the Appalachian Mountains. Colonists largely ignored the order, and the British had insufficient soldiers to enforce it.\n\nFaced with confrontations, the Iroquois agreed to adjust the line again in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1768). Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet, British Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Northern District, had called the Iroquois nations together in a grand conference in western New York, which a total of 3,102 Indians attended. They had long had good relations with Johnson, who had traded with them and learned their languages and customs. As Alan Taylor noted in his history, \"The Divided Ground: Indians, Settlers, and the Northern Borderland of the American Revolution\" (2006), the Iroquois were creative and strategic thinkers. They chose to sell to the British Crown all their remaining claim to the lands between the Ohio and Tennessee rivers, which they did not occupy, hoping by doing so to draw off English pressure on their territories in the Province of New York.\n\nDuring the American Revolution, the Iroquois first tried to stay neutral. The Reverend Samuel Kirkland, a Congregational minister working as a missionary, pressured the Oneida and the Tuscarora for a pro-American neutrality while Guy Johnson and his cousin John Johnson pressured the Mohawk, the Cayuga and the Seneca to fight for the British. Pressed to join one side or the other, the Tuscarora and the Oneida sided with the colonists, while the Mohawk, Seneca, Onondaga, and Cayuga remained loyal to Great Britain, with whom they had stronger relationships. Joseph Louis Cook offered his services to the United States and received a Congressional commission as a lieutenant colonel—the highest rank held by any Native American during the war. The Mohawk war chief Joseph Brant together with John Butler and John Johnson raised racially mixed forces of irregulars to fight for the Crown. Molly Brant had been the common-law wife of Sir William Johnson, and it was through her patronage that her brother Joseph came to be a war chief.\n\nThe Mohawk war chief Joseph Brant, other war chiefs, and British allies conducted numerous operations against frontier settlements in the Mohawk Valley, including the Cherry Valley massacre, destroying many villages and crops, and killing and capturing inhabitants. The destructive raids by Brant and other Loyalists led to appeals to Congress for help. The Continentals retaliated and in 1779, George Washington ordered the Sullivan Campaign, led by Col. Daniel Brodhead and General John Sullivan, against the Iroquois nations to \"not merely overrun, but destroy\", the British-Indian alliance. They burned many Iroquois villages and stores throughout western New York; refugees moved north to Canada. By the end of the war, few houses and barns in the valley had survived the warfare. In the aftermath of the Sullivan expedition, Brant visited Quebec City to ask General Sir Frederick Haildmand for assurances that the Mohawk and the other Loyalist Iroquois would receive a new homeland in Canada as compensation for their loyalty to the Crown if the British should lose.\n\nThe American Revolution was a war that caused a great divide amongst the colonists between Patriots and Loyalists; it caused a divide between the colonies and Great Britain, and it also caused a rift that would break the Iroquois Confederacy. At the onset of the Revolution, the Iroquois Confederacy's Six Nations attempted to take a stance of neutrality. However, almost inevitably, the Iroquois nations eventually had to take sides in the conflict. It is easy to see how the American Revolution would have caused conflict and confusion among the Six Nations. For years they had been used to thinking about the English and their colonists as one and the same people. In the American Revolution, the Iroquois Confederacy now had to deal with relationships between two governments.\n\nThe Iroquois Confederation's population had changed significantly since the arrival of Europeans. Disease had reduced their population to a fraction of what it had been in the past. Therefore, it was in their best interest to be on the good side of whoever would prove to be the winning side in the war, for the winning side would dictate how future relationships would be with the Iroquois in North America. Dealing with two governments made it hard to maintain a neutral stance, because the governments could get jealous easily if the Confederacy was interacting or trading more with one side over the other, or even if there was simply a perception of favoritism. Because of this challenging situation, the Six Nations had to choose sides. The Oneida and Tuscarora decided to support the American colonists, while the rest of the Iroquois League (the Cayuga, Mohawk, Onondaga, and Seneca) sided with the British and their Loyalists among the colonists.\n\nThere were many reasons that the Six Nations could not remain neutral and uninvolved in the Revolutionary War. One of these is simple proximity; the Iroquois Confederacy was too close to the action of the war to not be involved. The Six Nations were very discontented with the encroachment of the English and their colonists upon their land. They were particularly concerned with the border established in the Proclamation of 1763 and the Treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1768.\n\nDuring the American Revolution, the authority of the British government over the frontier was highly contested. The colonists tried to take advantage of this as much as possible by seeking their own profit and claiming new land. In 1775, the Six Nations were still neutral when \"a Mohawk person was killed by a Continental soldier\". Such a case shows how the Six Nations' proximity to the war drew them into it. They were concerned about being killed, and about their lands being taken from them. They could not show weakness and simply let the colonists and British do whatever they wanted. Many of the English and colonists did not respect the treaties made in the past. \"A number of His Majesty's subjects in the American colonies viewed the proclamation as a temporary prohibition which would soon give way to the opening of the area for settlement ... and that it was simply an agreement to quiet the minds of the Indians\". The Six Nations had to take a stand to show that they would not accept such treatment, and they looked to build a relationship with a government that would respect their territory.\n\nIn addition to being in close proximity to the war, the new lifestyle and economics of the Iroquois Confederacy since the arrival of the Europeans in North America made it nearly impossible for the Iroquois to isolate themselves from the conflict. By this time, the Iroquois had become dependent upon the trade of goods from the English and colonists, and had adopted many European customs, tools, and weapons. For example, they were increasingly dependent on firearms for hunting. After becoming so reliant, it would have been hard to even consider cutting off trade that brought goods that were a central part of everyday life.\n\nAs Barbara Graymont stated, \"Their task was an impossible one to maintain neutrality. Their economies and lives had become so dependent on each other for trading goods and benefits it was impossible to ignore the conflict. Meanwhile they had to try and balance their interactions with both groups. They did not want to seem as they were favoring one group over the other, because of sparking jealousy and suspicion from either side\". Furthermore, the English had made many agreements with the Six Nations over the years, yet most of the Iroquois' day-to-day interaction had been with the colonists. This made it a confusing situation for the Iroquois because they could not tell who the true heirs of the agreement were, and couldn't know if agreements with England would continue to be honored by the colonists if they were to win independence.\n\nSupporting either side in the Revolutionary War was a complicated decision. Each nation individually weighed their options to come up with a final stance that ultimately broke neutrality and ended the collective agreement of the Confederation. The British were clearly the most organized, and seemingly most powerful. In many cases, the British presented the situation to the Iroquois as the colonists just being \"naughty children\". On the other, the Iroquois considered that \"the British government was three thousand miles away. This placed them at a disadvantage in attempting to enforce both the Proclamation of 1763 and the Treaty at Fort Stanwix 1768 against land hungry frontiersmen.\" In other words, even though the British were the strongest and best organized faction, the Six Nations had concerns about whether they would truly be able to enforce their agreements from so far away.\n\nThe Iroquois also had concerns about the colonists. The British asked for Iroquois support in the war. \"In 1775, the Continental Congress sent a delegation to the Iroquois in Albany to ask for their neutrality in the war coming against the British\". It had been clear in prior years that the colonists had not been respectful of the land agreements made in 1763 and 1768. The Iroquois Confederacy was particularly concerned over the possibility of the colonists winning the war, for if a revolutionary victory were to occur, the Iroquois very much saw it as the precursor to their lands being taken away by the victorious colonists, who would no longer have the British Crown to restrain them. Continental army officers such as George Washington had attempted to destroy the Iroquois.\n\nOn a contrasting note, it was the colonists who had formed the most direct relationships with the Iroquois due to their proximity and trade ties. For the most part, the colonists and Iroquois had lived in relative peace since the English arrival on the continent a century and a half before. The Iroquois had to determine whether their relationships with the colonists were reliable, or whether the English would prove to better serve their interests. They also had to determine whether there were really any differences between how the English and the colonists would treat them.\n\nThe war ensued, and the Iroquois broke their confederation. Hundreds of years of precedent and collective government was trumped by the immensity of the American Revolutionary War. The Oneida and Tuscarora decided to support the colonists, while the rest of the Iroquois League (the Cayuga, Mohawk, Onondaga, and Seneca) sided with the British and Loyalists. At the conclusion of the war the fear that the colonists would not respect the Iroquois' pleas came true, especially after the majority of the Six Nations decided to side with the British and were no longer considered trustworthy by the newly independent Americans. In 1783 the Treaty of Paris was signed. While the treaty included peace agreements between all of the European nations involved in the war as well as the newborn United States, it made no provisions for the Iroquois, who were left to be treated with by the new United States government as it saw fit.\n\nAfter the Revolutionary War, the ancient central fireplace of the League was re-established at Buffalo Creek. The United States and the Iroquois signed the treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1784 under which the Iroquois ceded much of their historical homeland to the Americans, which was followed by another treaty in 1794 at Canandaigua which they ceded even more land to the Americans. The governor of New York state, George Clinton, was constantly pressuring the Iroquois to sell their land to white settlers, and as alcoholism became a major problem in the Iroquois communities, many did sell their land in order to buy more alcohol, usually to unscrupulous agents of land companies. At the same time, American settlers continued to push into the lands beyond the Ohio river, leading to a war between the Western Confederacy and the United States. One of the Iroquois chiefs, Cornplanter, persuaded the remaining Iroquois in New York state to remain neutral and not to join the Western Confederacy. At the same time, American policies to make the Iroquois more settled started to have some effect. Traditionally, for the Iroquois farming was woman's work and hunting was men's work; by the early 19th century, American policies to have the men farm the land and cease hunting were having effect. During this time, the Iroquois living in New York state become demoralized as more of their land was sold to land speculators while alcoholism, violence, and broken families became major problems on their reservations. The Oneida and the Cayuga sold almost all of their land and moved out of their traditional homelands.\n\nBy 1811, Methodist and Episcopalian missionaries established missions to assist the Oneida and Onondaga in western New York. However, white settlers continued to move into the area. By 1821, a group of Oneida led by Eleazar Williams, son of a Mohawk woman, went to Wisconsin to buy land from the Menominee and Ho-Chunk and thus move their people further westward. In 1838, the Holland Land Company used forged documents to cheat the Seneca of almost all of their land in western New York, but a Quaker missionary, Asher Wright, launched lawsuits that led to one of the Seneca reservations being returned in 1842 and another in 1857. However, as late as the 1950s both the United States and New York governments confiscated land belonging to the Six Nations for roads, dams and reservoirs with the land being given to Cornplanter for keeping the Iroquois from joining the Western Confederacy in the 1790s being confiscated and flooded by the Kinzua Dam. \nCaptain Joseph Brant and a group of Iroquois left New York to settle in the Province of Quebec (present-day Ontario). To partially replace the lands they had lost in the Mohawk Valley and elsewhere because of their fateful alliance with the British Crown, they were given a large land grant on the Grand River, at Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation. Brant's crossing of the river gave the original name to the area: Brant's Ford. By 1847, European settlers began to settle nearby and named the village Brantford. The original Mohawk settlement was on the south edge of the present-day Canadian city at a location still favorable for launching and landing canoes. In the 1830s many additional Onondaga, Oneida, Seneca, Cayuga, and Tuscarora relocated into the Indian Territory, the Province of Upper Canada, and Wisconsin.\n\nMany Iroquois (mostly Mohawk) and Iroquois-descended Métis people living in Lower Canada (primarily at Kahnawake) took employment with the Montreal-based North West Company during its existence from 1779 to 1821 and became voyageurs or free traders working in the North American fur trade as far west as the Rocky Mountains. They are known to have settled in the area around Jasper's House and possibly as far west as the Finlay River and north as far as the Pouce Coupe and Dunvegan areas, where they founded new Aboriginal communities which have persisted to the present day claiming either First Nations or Métis identity and indigenous rights. The Michel Band, Mountain Métis, and Aseniwuche Winewak Nation of Canada in Alberta and the Kelly Lake community in British Columbia all claim Iroquois ancestry.\n\nDuring the 18th century, the Catholic Canadian Iroquois living outside of Montreal reestablished ties with the League Iroquois. During the American Revolution, the Canadian Iroquois declared their neutrality and refused to fight for the Crown despite the offers of Sir Guy Carlton, the governor of Quebec. Many Canadian Iroquois worked for the both Hudson's Bay Company and the Northwest Company as a \"voyageurs\" in the fur trade in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. In the War of 1812, the Canadian Iroquois again declared their neutrality. The Canadian Iroquois communities at Oka and Kahnaweke were prosperous settlements in the 19th century, supporting themselves via farming and the sale of sleds, snowshoes, boats, and baskets. In 1884, about 100 Canadian Iroquois were hired by the British government to serve as river pilots and boatmen for the relief expedition for the besieged General Charles Gordon in Khartoum in the Sudan, taking the force commanded by Field Marshal Wolsely up the Nile from Cairo to Khartoum. On their way back to Canada, the Canadian Iroquois river pilots and boatmen stopped in London, where they were personally thanked by Queen Victoria for their services to Queen and Country. In 1886, when a bridge was being built at the St. Lawrence, a number of Iroquois men from Kahnawke were hired to help built and the Iroquois workers proved so skilled as steelwork erectors that since that time, a number of bridges and skycrapers in Canada and the United States have been built by the Iroquois steelmen.\n\nDuring World War I, it was Canadian policy to encourage men from the First Nations to enlist in the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF), where their skills at hunting made them excellent as snipers and scouts. As the Iroquois Six Nations were considered to be the most warlike of all Canada's First Nations, and in turn, the Mohawk were considered to the most warlike of all the Six Nations, the government especially encouraged the Iroquois and above all the Mohawks to join the CEF. About the half of the 4, 000 or so First Nations men who served in the CEF were Iroquois. Men from the Six Nations reservation at Brantford were encouraged to join the 114th Haldimand Battalion (also known as \"Brock's Rangers) of the CEF, where two entire companies including the officers were all Iroquois. The 114th Battalion was formed in December 1915 and broken up in November 1916 to provide reinforcements for other battalions. Iroquois captured by the Germans were often subjected to cruel treatment. A Mohawk from Brantford, William Forster Lickers, who enlisted in the CEF in September 1914 was captured at the Second Battle of Ypres in April 1915, where he was savagely beaten by his captors as one German officer wanted to see if \"Indians could feel pain\". Lickers was beaten so badly that he was left paralyzed for the rest of his life, through the officer was well pleased to establish that Indians did indeed feel pain.\n\nThe Six Nations council at Brantford tended to see themselves as a sovereign nation that was allied to the Crown through the Covenant Chain going back to the 17th century and thus allied to King George V personally instead of being under the authority of Canada. One Iroquois clan mother in a letter sent in August 1916 to a recruiting sergeant who refused to allow her teenage son to join the CEF under the grounds that he was underage, declared the Six Nations were not subject to the laws of Canada and he had no right to refuse her son because Canadian laws did not apply to them. As she explained, the Iroquois regarded the Covenant Chain as still being in effect, meaning the Iroquois were only fighting in the war because they were allied to the Crown and were responding to an appeal for help from their ally, King George V, who had asked them to enlist in the CEF.\n\nThe complex political environment which emerged in Canada with the Haudenosaunee grew out of the Anglo-American era of European colonization. At the end of the War of 1812, Britain shifted Indian affairs from the military to civilian control. With the creation of the Dominion of Canada in 1867, civil authority, and thus Indian affairs, passed to Canadian officials with Britain retaining control of military and security matters. At the turn of the century, the Canadian government began passing a series of Acts which were strenuously objected to by the Iroquois Confederacy. During World War I, an act attempted to conscript Six Nations men for military service. Under the Soldiers Resettlement Act, legislation was introduced to redistribute native land. Finally in 1920, an Act was proposed to force citizenship on \"Indians\" with or without their consent, which would then automatically remove their share of any tribal lands from tribal trust and make the land and the person subject to the laws of Canada.\n\nThe Haudenosaunee hired a lawyer to defend their rights in the Supreme Court of Canada. The Supreme Court refused to take the case, declaring that the members of the Six Nations were British citizens. In effect, as Canada was at the time a division of the British government, it was not an international state, as defined by international law. In contrast, the Iroquois Confederacy had been making treaties and functioning as a state since 1643 and all of their treaties had been negotiated with Britain, not Canada. As a result, a decision was made in 1921 to send a delegation to petition the King of England, whereupon Canada's External Affairs division blocked issuing passports. In response, the Iroquois began issuing their own passports and sent Levi General, the Cayuga Chief \"Deskaheh,\" to England with their attorney. Winston Churchill dismissed their complaint claiming that it was within the realm of Canadian jurisdiction and referred them back to Canadian officials.\n\nOn 4 December 1922, Charles Stewart, Superintendent of Indian Affairs, and Duncan Campbell Scott, Deputy Superintendent of the Canadian Department of Indian Affairs traveled to Brantford to negotiate a settlement on the issues with the Six Nations. After the meeting, the Native delegation brought the offer to the tribal council, as was customary under Haudenosaunee law. The council agreed to accept the offer, but before they could respond, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police conducted a liquor raid on the Iroquois' Grand River territory. The siege lasted three days and prompted the Haudenosaunee to send Deskaheh to Washington, DC, to meet with the chargé d'affaires of the Netherlands asking the Dutch Queen to sponsor them for membership in the League of Nations. Under pressure from the British, the Netherlands reluctantly refused sponsorship.\n\nDeskaheh and the tribal attorney proceeded to Geneva and attempted to gather support. \"On 27 September 1923, delegates representing Estonia, Ireland, Panama and Persia signed a letter asking for communication of the Six Nations' petition to the League's assembly,\" but the effort was blocked. Six Nations delegates traveled to the Hague and back to Geneva attempting to gain supporters and recognition, while back in Canada, the government was drafting a mandate to replace the traditional Haudenosaunee Confederacy Council with one that would be elected under the auspices of the Canadian Indian Act. In an unpublicized signing on 17 September 1924, Prime Minister Mackenzie King and Governor-General Lord Byng of Vimy signed the Order in Council, which set elections on the Six Nations reserve for 21 October. Only 26 ballots were cast.\n\nThe long-term effect of the Order was that the Canadian government had wrested control over the Haudenosaunee trust funds from the Iroquois Confederation and decades of litigation would follow. In 1979, over 300 Indian chiefs visited London to oppose Patriation of the Canadian Constitution, fearing that their rights to be recognized in the Royal Proclamation of 1763 would be jeopardized. In 1981, hoping again to clarify that judicial responsibilities of treaties signed with Britain were not transferred to Canada, several Alberta Indian chiefs filed a petition with the British High Court of Justice. They lost the case but gained an invitation from the Canadian government to participate in the constitutional discussions which dealt with protection of treaty rights.\n\nIn 1990, a long-running dispute over ownership of land at Oka, Quebec caused a violent stand-off. The Mohawk reservation at Oka had become dominated by a group called the Mohawk Warrior Society that emerged in smuggling across the U.S-Canada border and were well armed with assault rifles. On 11 July 1990, the Mohawk Warrior Society tried to stop the building of a golf course on land claimed by the Mohawk people, which led to a shoot-out between the Warrior Society and the \"Sûreté du Québec\" left a policeman dead. In the resulting Oka Crisis, the Warrior Society occupied both the land that they claimed belonged to the Mohawk people and the Mercier bridge linking Montreal to the mainland. On 17 August 1990, Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa asked for the Canadian Army to intervene to maintain \"public safety\", leading to the deployment of the Royal 22 Régiment to Oka and Montreal. The stand-off ended on 26 September 1990 with a melee between the soldiers and the warriors. The dispute over ownership of the land at Oka continues.\n\n\"See: Indian Termination Policy\"\n\nIn the period between World War II and The Sixties the US government followed a policy of Indian Termination for its Native citizens. In a series of laws, attempting to mainstream tribal people into the greater society, the government strove to end the U.S. government's recognition of tribal sovereignty, eliminate trusteeship over Indian reservations, and implement state law applicability to native persons. In general the laws were expected to create taxpaying citizens, subject to state and federal taxes as well as laws, from which Native people had previously been exempt.\n\nOn 13 August 1946 the Indian Claims Commission Act of 1946, Pub. L. No. 79-726, ch. 959, was passed. Its purpose was to settle for all time any outstanding grievances or claims the tribes might have against the U.S. for treaty breaches, unauthorized taking of land, dishonorable or unfair dealings, or inadequate compensation. Claims had to be filed within a five-year period, and most of the 370 complaints that were submitted were filed at the approach of the 5-year deadline in August, 1951.\n\nOn 2 July 1948 Congress enacted [Public Law 881] 62 Stat. 1224, which transferred criminal jurisdiction over offenses committed by and against \"Indians\" to the State of New York. It covered all reservations lands within the state and prohibited the deprivation of hunting and fishing rights which may have been guaranteed to \"any Indian tribe, band, or community, or members thereof.\" It further prohibited the state from requiring tribal members to obtain fish and game licenses. Within 2 years, Congress passed [Public Law 785] 64 Stat. 845, on 13 September 1950 which extended New York's authority to civil disputes between Indians or Indians and others within the State. It allowed the tribes to preserve customs, prohibited taxation on reservations, and reaffirmed hunting and fishing rights. It also prohibited the state from enforcing judgments regarding any land disputes or applying any State Laws to tribal lands or claims prior to the effective date of the law 13 September 1952. During congressional hearings on the law, tribes strongly opposed the passage, fearful that states would deprive them of their reservations. The State of New York disavowed any intention to break up or deprive tribes of their reservations and asserted that they did not have the ability to do so.\n\nOn 1 August 1953, United States Congress issued a formal statement, House Concurrent Resolution 108, which was the formal policy presentation announcing the official federal policy of Indian termination. The resolution called for the \"immediate termination of the Flathead, Klamath, Menominee, Potawatomi, and Turtle Mountain Chippewa, as well as all tribes in the states of California, New York, Florida, and Texas.\" All federal aid, services, and protection offered to Native people were to cease, and the federal trust relationship and management of reservations would end. Individual members of terminated tribes were to become full United States citizens with all the rights, benefits and responsibilities of any other United States citizen. The resolution also called for the Interior Department to quickly identify other tribes who would be ready for termination in the near future.\n\nBeginning in 1953, a Federal task force began meeting with the tribes of the Six Nations. Despite tribal objections, legislation was introduced into Congress for termination. The proposed legislation involved more than 11,000 Indians of the Iroquois Confederation and was divided into two separate bills. One bill dealt with the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga and Tuscarora tribes and the other dealt with the Seneca. The arguments the Six Nations made in their hearings with committees were that their treaties showed that the United States recognized that their lands belonged to the Six Nations, not the United States and that \"termination contradicted any reasonable interpretation that their lands would not be claimed or their nations disturbed\" by the federal government. The bill for the Iroquois Confederation died in committee without further serious consideration.\n\nOn 31 August 1964, H. R. 1794 \"An Act to authorize payment for certain interests in lands within the Allegheny Indian Reservation in New York\" was passed by Congress and sent to the president for signature. The bill authorized payment for resettling and rehabilitation of the Seneca Indians who were being dislocated by the construction of the Kinzua Dam on the Allegheny River. Though only 127 Seneca families (about 500 people) were being dislocated, the legislation benefited the entire Seneca Nation, because the taking of the Indian land for the dam abridged a 1794 treaty agreement. In addition, the bill provided that within three years, a plan from the Interior Secretary should be submitted to Congress withdrawing all federal supervision over the Seneca Nation, though technically civil and criminal jurisdiction had lain with the State of New York since 1950.\n\nAccordingly, on 5 September 1967 a memo from the Department of the Interior announced proposed legislation was being submitted to end federal ties with the Seneca. In 1968 a new liaison was appointed from the BIA for the tribe to assist the tribe in preparing for termination and rehabilitation. The Seneca were able to hold off termination until President Nixon issued his \"Special Message to the Congress on Indian Affairs\" in July 1970. Thus, no New York tribes then living in New York were terminated during this period.\n\nIn a twist of fate, one former New York Tribe did lose its federal recognition. The Emigrant Indians of New York included the Oneidas, Stockbridge-Munsee, and Brothertown Indians of Wisconsin. In an effort to fight termination and force the government into recognizing their outstanding land claims from New York, the three tribes filed litigation with the Claims Commission in the 1950s. They won their claim on 11 August 1964. Public Law 90-93 81 Stat. 229 \"Emigrant New York Indians of Wisconsin Judgment Act\" established federal trusteeship to pay the Oneidas and Stockbridge-Munsee, effectively ending Congressional termination efforts for them. Though the law did not specifically state the Brothertown Indians were terminated, it authorized all payments to be made directly to each enrollee with special provisions for minors to be handled by the Secretary. The payments were not subject to state or federal taxes. Beginning in 1978, the Brothertown Indians submitted a petition to regain federal recognition. In 2012 the Department of the Interior, in the final determination on the Brothertown petition found that Congress had terminated their tribal status when it granted them citizenship in 1838 and therefore only Congress could restore their tribal status. They are still seeking Congressional approval.\n\nFor the Haudenosaunee, grief for a loved one who died was a powerful emotion that if not attended would cause all sorts of problems for the grieving who if left without consolation would go mad. Rituals to honor the dead were very important and the most important of all was the Condolence ceremony to provide consolation for those who lost a family member or friend. Since it was believed that the death of a family member also weakened the spiritual strength of the surviving family members, it was considered crucially important to replace the lost family member by providing a substitute who could be adopted or alternatively could be tortured to provide an outlet for the grief. Hence the \"mourning wars\".\n\nOne of the central features of traditional Iroquois life was the \"mourning wars\" when Haudenosaunee warriors would raid neighboring peoples in search of captives to replace those Haudenosaunee who had died. War for the Haudenosaunee was primarily for captives, and the usual factors that were considered benefits of war for the Europeans like expansion of territory or glory in battle did not count for the Haudeenosaunee, who only cared about taking captives. A successful war party was one that had taken many prisoners without suffering losses in return; killing enemies was considered acceptable if necessary, but disapproved of as it reduced the number of potential captives. Captives were seen as far more important than scalps. Additionally, war served as a way for young men to demonstrate their valor and courage, which was not only a prerequisite for becoming a chief, but also essential if one wanted to get married and hence have sex. A man considered a coward was viewed as unattractive by Haudenosaunee women who saw bravery in war as a very attractive feature in a man. In the precontact era, war was relativity bloodless as First Nations peoples fought one another in suits of wooden armor. In 1609, the French explorer Samuel de Champlain observed several battles between the Algonquins and the Iroquois which featured hardly any killing, which seemed to be the norm for First Nations wars. At a battle between the Algonquins and the Iroquois by the shores of Lake Champlain, the only people killed were two Iroquois warriors when Champlain demonstrated the power of his musket to his Algonquin allies.\n\nThe clan mothers would demand a \"mourning war\" to provide consolation and renewed spiritual strength for a family that lost a member to death by accusing the warriors of cowardice; either the warriors would go on a \"mourning war\" or would be marked as cowards forever, which make them unmarriageable. At this point, the warriors would then usually leave to raid a neighboring people in search of captives. The captives were either adopted into Haudenosaunee families to become Haudenosaunee, or were to be killed after bouts of ritualized torture as a way of expressing rage at the death of a family member. The male captives were usually received with blows as they were marched into the community, and were then all captives regardless of their sex or age were stripped naked and tied to poles in the middle of the community. After having sensitive parts of their bodies burned and some of their fingernails pulled out, the prisoners were allowed to rest and given food and water. In the following days, the captives had to dance naked before the community, and then it was decided if they were to be adopted or killed. If those who were adopted into the Haudenosaunee families made a sincere effort to become Haudenosaunee, then they would be embraced by the community, and if they did not, then they were swiftly executed.\n\nThose slated for execution had to wear red and black facial paint and were \"adopted\" by a family who addressed the prisoner as \"uncle\", \"aunt\", \"nephew\" or \"niece\" depending on their age and sex, and would bring them food and water. The captive would be executed after a day-long torture session of burning and removing body parts, which the prisoner was expected to behave with stoicism and nobility (an expectation not usually met) before being scalped alive, had hot sand applied to the exposed skull and finally killed by cutting out their hearts. Afterwards, the victim's body was cut and eaten by the community. The practice of ritual torture and execution together with cannibalism ended some time in the early 18th century, and by late-18th-century European writers like Philip Mazzei and James Adair were denying that the Haudenosaunee engaged in ritual torture and cannibalism, saying they had seen no evidence of such practices during their visits to Haudenosaunee villages.\n\nFor Iroquois, the purpose of war was to take prisoners first and foremost, with the Onondaga chief Teganissorens telling the governor of New York, Sir Robert Hunter, in 1711: \"We are not like you Christians, for when you have prisoners of one another you send them home, by such means you can never rout one another\". The converse of this strategy was that the Iroquois would not accept losses in battle as it defeated the whole purpose of the \"mourning wars\", which was to add to their numbers, not decrease them. The French during their wars with the Haudenosaunee were often astonished when a war party that was on the verge of victory over them could be made to retreat by merely killing one or two of their number. The European notion of a glorious death in battle had no counterpart with the Haudenosaunee. Death in battle was accepted only when absolutely necessary, and the Iroquois believed the souls of those who died in battle were destined to spend eternity as angry ghosts haunting the world in search of vengeance. For this reason, those who died in battle were never buried in community cemeteries, as it would bring the presence of unhappy ghosts into the community.\n\nFor these reasons, the Haudenosaunee engaged in tactics that the French, the British and later on the Americans all considered to be cowardly. The Haudenosaunee preferred ambushes and surprise attacks, would almost never attack a fortified place or attack frontally, or would retreat if outnumbered. If Kanienkeh was invaded, the Haudenosaunee would attempt to ambush the enemy, or alternatively they would retreat behind the wooden walls of their villages to endure a siege. If the enemy appeared too powerful as when the French invaded Kanienkeh in 1693, the Haudenosaunee burned their villages and their crops and the entire population retreated into the woods to wait for the French to depart. The main weapons for the Iroquois were bows and arrows with flint tips and quivers made from corn husks. Shields and war clubs were made from wood. After contact was established with Europeans, metal knives and hatchets were extensively used together with tomahawks with iron or steel blades. Before taking to the field, war chiefs would lead ritual purification ceremonies where the warriors would dance around a pole painted red.\n\nWhen European diseases that the Indians had no immunity to like smallpox devastated the Five Nations in the 17th century, causing thousands of deaths, the League began a period of \"mourning wars\" without precedent, which led to the virtual destruction of the Huron, Petun and Neutral peoples. By the 1640s, it is estimated that smallpox had reduced the population of the Haudenosaunee by least 50%, which required massive \"mourning wars\" to make up these losses. The American historian Daniel Richter wrote it was at this point that war changed from being sporadic, small-scale raids launched in response to individual deaths and became \"the constant and increasing undifferentiated symptom of societies in demographic crisis\". Furthermore, the introduction of guns, which could pierce the wooden armor, made First Nations warfare bloodier and more deadly than it had been in the pre-contact era, ending the age when armed conflicts were more brawls than battles as Europeans would had understood the term. At the same time, guns could be only be obtained by trading furs with the Europeans, and once the Haudenosaunee exhausted their supplies of beaver by about 1640, they were forced to buy beaver pelts from Indians living further north, which led them to attempt to eliminate other middlemen in order to monopolize the fur trade in a series of \"beaver wars\". Richter wrote \"the mourning war tradition, deaths from disease, dependence on firearms, and the trade in furs combined to produce a dangerous spiral: epidemics led to deadlier mourning wars fought with firearms; the need for guns increased the need for pelts to trade for them; the quest for furs provoked wars with other nations; and deaths in those wars began the mourning war cycle anew\". From 1640 to 1701, the Five Nations was almost continuously at war, battling at various times the French, the Huron, the Erie, the Neutral, the Lenape, the Susquenhannock, the Petun, the Abenaki, the Ojibwa, and the Algonquins, fighting campaigns from Virginia to the Mississippi and all the way to what is now northern Ontario.\n\nDespite taking thousands of captives, the Five Nations populations continued to fall, as diseases continued to take their toll while Jesuits, whom the Haudenosaunee were forced to accept after making peace with the French in 1667, encouraged Catholic converts to move to the St. Lawrence river valley. In the 1640s, the Mohawks could field about 800 warriors, and the 1670s, could field only 300 warriors, which suggested a population decline.\n\nThe Iroquois League traditions allowed for the dead to be symbolically replaced through captives taken in \"mourning wars\", the blood feuds and vendettas that were an essential aspect of Iroquois culture. As a way of expediting the mourning process, raids were conducted to take vengeance and seize captives. Captives were generally adopted directly by the grieving family to replace the member(s) who had been lost.\n\nThis process not only allowed the Iroquois to maintain their own numbers, but also to disperse and assimilate their enemies. The adoption of conquered peoples, especially during the period of the Beaver Wars (1609-1701), meant that the Iroquois League was composed largely of naturalized members of other tribes. Cadwallader Colden wrote, \"It has been a constant maxim with the Five Nations, to save children and young men of the people they conquer, to adopt them into their own Nation, and to educate them as their own children, without distinction; These young people soon forget their own country and nation and by this policy the Five Nations make up the losses which their nation suffers by the people they lose in war.\" Those who attempted to return to their families were harshly punished; for instance, the French fur trader Pierre-Esprit Radisson was captured by an Iroquois raiding party as a teenager, was adopted by a Mohawk family, ran away to return to his family in Trois-Rivières, and upon being recaptured was punished by having his fingernails pulled out and having one of his fingers cut to the bone. However, Radisson was not executed as his adopted parents provided gifts to the families of the men Radisson had killed when he fled as compensation for their loss; several of the Huron who fled with Radisson were not so lucky and were executed.\n\nBy 1668, two-thirds of the Oneida village were assimilated Algonquians and Hurons. At Onondaga there were Native Americans of seven different nations and among the Seneca eleven. They also adopted European captives, as did the Catholic Mohawk in settlements outside Montreal. This tradition of adoption and assimilation was common to native people of the northeast but was quite different from European settlers' notions of combat.\n\nAt the time of first European contact the Iroquois lived in a small number of large villages scattered throughout their territory. Each nation had between one and four villages at any one time, and villages were moved approximately every five to twenty years as soil and firewood were depleted. These settlements were surrounded by a palisade and usually located in a defensible area such as a hill, with access to water. Because of their appearance with the palisade, Europeans termed them castles. Villages were usually built on level or raised ground, surrounded by log palisades and sometimes ditches.\n\nWithin the villages the inhabitants lived in longhouses. Longhouses varied in size from 15 to 150 feet long and 15 to 25 feet in breadth. Longhouses were usually built of layers of elm bark on a frame of rafters and standing logs raised upright. In 1653, Dutch official and landowner Adriaen van der Donck described a Mohawk longhouse in his \"Description of New Netherland\". \n\nUsually, between 2 and 20 families lived in a single longhouse with sleeping platforms being 2 feet above the ground and food left to dry on the rafters. A castle might contain twenty or thirty longhouses. In addition to the castles the Iroquois also had smaller settlements which might be occupied seasonally by smaller groups, for example for fishing or hunting. Living in the smoke-filled longhouses often caused conjunctivitis.\n\nTotal population for the five nations has been estimated at 20,000 before 1634. After 1635 the population dropped to around 6,800, chiefly due to the epidemic of smallpox introduced by contact with European settlers. The Iroquois lived in extended families divided clans headed by clan mothers that grouped into \"moieities\" (\"halves\"). The typical clan consisted of about 50 to 200 people. The division of the Iroquois went as follows:\nCayuga \n\"Moiety\" (A) clans: Bear, Beaver, Heron, Turtle, Wolf\n\"Moiety\" (B) clans: Turtle, Bear, Deer\nTuscarora\n\"Moiety\" (A) clans: Bear, Wolf\n\"Moeity\" (B) clans: Eel, Snipe, Beaver, Turtle, Deer\nSeneca\n\"Moeity\" (A) clans: Heron, Beaver, Bear, Wolf, Turtle\n\"Moeity\" (B) clans: Deer, Hawk, Eel, Snipe\nOnondaga\n\"Moeity\" (A) clans: Tortoise, Wolf, Snipe, Eagle, Beaver\n\"Moeity\" (B) clan: Bear, Hawk, Eel, Deer\nOneida\n\"Moeity\" (A) clan: wolf\n\"Moeity\" (B) clans: Bear, Turtle\nMohawk\n\"Moeity\" (A) clans: Wolf, Bear\n\"Moeity\" (B) clan: Turtle. Government was by the 50 \"sachems\" representing the various clans who were chosen by the clan mothers. Assisting the \"sachems\" were the \"Pinetree Chiefs\" who served as diplomats and the \"War Chiefs\" who led the war parties; neither the \"Pinetree Chiefs\" or the \"War Chiefs\" were allowed to vote at council meetings.\n\nBy the late 1700s The Iroquois were building smaller log cabins resembling those of the colonists, but retaining some native features, such as bark roofs with smoke holes and a central fireplace. The main woods used by the Iroquois to make their utensils were oak, birch, hickory and elm. Bones and antlers were used to make hunting and fishing equipment.\n\nThe Iroquois are a mix of horticulturalists, farmers, fishers, gatherers and hunters, though their main diet traditionally has come from farming. The main crops they cultivated are corn, beans and squash, which were called the three sisters (\"De-oh-há-ko\") and are considered special gifts from the Creator. These crops are grown strategically. The cornstalks grow, the bean plants climb the stalks, and the squash grow beneath, inhibiting weeds and keeping the soil moist under the shade of their broad leaves. In this combination, the soil remained fertile for several decades. The food was stored during the winter, and it lasted for two to three years. When the soil in one area eventually lost its fertility, the Haudenosaunee moved their village. For the Iroquois, farming was traditionally women's work and the entire process of planting, maintaining, harvesting and cooking the \"Three Sisters\" were done by women. At harvest time, Iroquois women would use corn husks to make hats, dolls, rope and moccasins. Besides for the \"Three Sisters\", the Iroquois also eat artichokes, leeks, cucumbers, turnips, pumpkins, a number of different berries such blackberries, blueberries, gooseberries, etc. and wild nuts. The \"Three Sisters\" were ground up into hominy and soups in clay pots, which were disregarded for metal pots after the contact was made with Europeans.\n\nGathering is the traditional job of the women and children. Wild roots, greens, berries and nuts were gathered in the summer. During spring, sap is tapped from the maple trees and boiled into maple syrup, and herbs are gathered for medicine. After the coming of Europeans, the Iroquois started to grow apples, pears, cherries, and peaches.\n\nThe Iroquois hunted mostly deer but also other game such as wild turkey and migratory birds. Muskrat and beaver were hunted during the winter. Archaeologists have the bones of bison, elk, deer, bear, raccoon, and porcupines at Iroquois villages. Fishing was also a significant source of food because the Iroquois had villages mostly in the St.Lawrence and Great Lakes areas. The Iroquois used nets made from vegetable fiber with weights of pebbles for fishing. They fished salmon, trout, bass, perch and whitefish until the St. Lawrence became too polluted by industry. In the spring the Iroquois netted, and in the winter fishing holes were made in the ice. Allium tricoccum is also a part of traditional Iroquois cuisine. Starting about 1620, the Iroquois started to raise pigs, geese and chickens, which they had acquired from the Dutch.\n\nIn 1644 Johannes Megapolensis described Mohawk traditional wear. \n\nOn their feet the Iroquois wore moccasins, \"true to nature in its adjustment to the foot, beautiful in its materials and finish, and durable as an article of apparel.\" \n\nMoccasins of a sort were also made of corn husks.\n\nIn 1653 Dutch official Adriaen van der Donck wrote: \n\nDuring the 17th century, Iroquois clothing changed rapidly as a result of the introduction of scissors and needles obtained from the Europeans, and the British scholar Michael Johnson has cautioned that European accounts of Iroquois clothing from the latter 17th century may not have entirely reflected traditional pre-contact Iroquois clothing. In the 17th century women normally went topless in the warm months while wearing a buckskin skirt overlapping on the left while in the winter women covered their upper bodies with a cape-like upper garment with an opening for the head. By the 18th century, cloth colored red and blue obtained from Europeans became the standard material for clothing with the men and women wearing blouses and shirts that usually decorated with beadwork and ribbons and were often worn alongside sliver broaches.\n\nBy the latter 18th century, women were wearing muslin or calico long, loose-fitting overdresses. The tendency of Iroquois women to abandon their traditional topless style of dressing in the warm months reflected European influence. Married women wore their hair in a single braid held in place by a comb made of bone, antler or silver while unmarried wore their hair in several braids. Warriors wore moccasins, leggings and short kilts and on occasion wore robes that were highly decorated with painted designs. Initially, men's clothing was made of buckskin and were decorated with porcupine quill-work and later on was made of broadcloth obtained from Europeans. The bodies and faces of Iroquois men were heavily tattooed with geometric designs and their noses and ears were pieced with rings made up of wampun or silver. On the warpath, the faces and bodies of the warriors were painted half red, half black. The men usually shaved most of their hair with leaving only a tuft of hair in the center, giving the name Mohawk to their hair style. A cap made of either buckskin or cloth tied to wood splints called the \"Gus-to-weh\" that was decorated with feathers was often worn by men. Buckskin ammunition pouches with straps over the shoulder together with belts or slashes that carried powder horn and tomahawks were usually worn by warriors. Quilled knife cases were worn around the neck. Chiefs wore headdresses made of deer antler. By the 18th century, Iroquois men normally wore shirts and leggings made of broadcloth and buckskin coats. In the 17th and 18th centuries silver armbands and gorgets were popular accessories.\n\nBy the 1900s most Iroquois were wearing the same clothing as their non-Iroquois neighbors. Today most nations only wear their traditional clothing to ceremonies or special events.\nMen wore a cap with a single long feather rotating in a socket called a \"gustoweh\". Later, feathers in the gustoweh denote the wearer's tribe by their number and positioning. The Mohawk wear three upright feathers, the Oneida two upright and one down. The Onondaga wear one feather pointing upward and another pointing down. The Cayuga have a single feather at a forty-five degree angle. The Seneca wear a single feather pointing up, and the Tuscarora have no distinguishing feathers.\nWriting in 1851 Morgan wrote that women's outfits consisted of a skirt (gä-kä'-ah) \"usually of blue broadcloth, and elaborately embroidered with bead-work. It requires two yards of cloth, which is worn with the selvedge at the top and bottom; the skirt being secured about the waist and descending nearly to the top of the moccasin.\" Under the skirt, between the knees and the moccasins, women wore leggings (gise'-hǎ), called \"pantalettes\" by Morgan, \"of red broadcloth, and ornamented with a border of beadwork around the lower edge ... In ancient times the gise'-hǎ was made of deer-skin and embroidered with porcupine-quill work.\" An over-dress (ah-de-a'-da-we-sa) of muslin or calico was worn over the skirt, it is \"gathered slightly at the waist, and falls part way down the skirt ... In front it is generally buttoned with silver broaches.\" The blanket (e'yose) is two or three yards of blue or green broadcloth \"it falls from the head or neck in natural folds the width of the cloth, as the selvedges are at the top and bottom, and it is gathered round the person like a shawl.\"\n\nThe women wore their hair very long and tied together at the back, or \"tied at the back of the head and folded into a tress of about a hand's length, like a beaver tail ... they wear around the forehead a strap of wampum shaped like the headband that some was worn in olden times.\" \"The men have a long lock hanging down, some on one side of the head, and some on both sides. On the top of their heads they have a streak of hair from the forehead to the neck, about the breadth of three fingers, and this they shorten until it is about two or three fingers long, and it stands right on end like a cock's comb or hog's bristles; on both sides of this cock's comb they cut all the hair short, except for the aforesaid locks, and they also leave on the bare places here and there small locks, such as aree in sweeping brushes and then they are in fine array.\" This is the forerunner to what is today called a \"Mohawk hairstyle.\"\n\nThe women did not paint their faces. The men \"paint their faces red, blue, etc.\"\n\nPlants traditionally used by the Iroquois include Agrimonia gryposepala, which was to treat diarrhea, and interrupted fern, used for blood and venereal diseases and conditions. Cone flower (Echinacea), an immune system booster and treatment for respiratory disease was also known and used. They also give an infusion of Chelidonium majus, another plant & milk to pigs that drool and have sudden movements. They use Ranunculus acris, in that apply a poultice of the smashed plant to the chest for pains and for colds, take an infusion of the roots for diarrhea, and apply a poultice of plant fragments with another plant to the skin for excess water in the blood. Symphyotrichum novae-angliae is used in a decoction for weak skin, use a decoction of the roots and leaves for fevers, use the plant as a \"love medicine\", and use an infusion of whole plant and rhizomes from another plant to treat mothers with intestinal fevers. A decoction of the roots of chicory is used as a wash and applied as a poultice to chancres and fever sores. A decoction of the root of Allium tricoccum is used to treat worms in children, and they also use the decoction as a spring tonic to \"clean you out\". Epigaea repens is also utilized, as they use a compound for labor pains in parturition, use a compound decoction for rheumatism, take a decoction of the leaves for indigestion, and they also take a decoction of the whole plant or roots, stalks and leaves taken for the kidneys. A pounded infusion of the roots of Potentilla canadensis is given as an antidiarrheal. They also use Senna hebecarpa as a worm remedy and take a compound decoction of it as a laxative. The whole plant of Solidago rugosa is used for biliousness and as liver medicine, and they take decoction of its flowers and leaves dizziness, weakness or sunstroke. The Iroquois take a compound decoction of the Carex oligosperma as an emetic before running or playing lacrosse. They also use Waldsteinia fragarioides taking a compound decoction of the plants as a blood remedy, and applying a poultice of the smashed plants to snakebites.\n\nThe Iroquois also used quinine, chamomile, ipecac, and a form of penicillin.\n\nThe Iroquois have historically followed a matriarchal system. No person is entitled to 'own' land, but it is believed that the Creator appointed women as stewards of the land. Traditionally, the Clan Mothers appoint leaders, as they have raised children and are therefore held to a higher regard. By the same token, if a leader does not prove sound, becomes corrupt or does not listen to the people, the Clan Mothers have the power to strip him of his leadership.\n\nThe Iroquois have traditionally followed a matrilineal system, with women holding property and hereditary leadership passing through their lines. Historically women have held the dwellings, horses and farmed land, and a woman's property before marriage has stayed in her possession without being mixed with that of her husband. Men and women have traditionally had separate roles but both hold real power in the Nations. The work of a woman's hands is hers to do with as she sees fit. Historically, at marriage, a young couple lived in the longhouse of the wife's family. A woman choosing to divorce a shiftless or otherwise unsatisfactory husband is able to ask him to leave the dwelling and take his possessions with him.\n\nThe children of a traditional marriage belong to their mother's clan and gain their social status through hers. Her brothers are important teachers and mentors to the children, especially introducing boys to men's roles and societies. The clans are matrilineal, that is, clan ties are traced through the mother's line. If a couple separates, the woman traditionally keeps the children. The chief of a clan can be removed at any time by a council of the women elders of that clan. The chief's sister has historically been responsible for nominating his successor. The clan mothers, the elder women of each clan, are highly respected. It is regarded as incest by the Iroquois to marry within one's matrilineal clan, but considered acceptable to marry someone from the same patrilineal clan.\n\nLike many cultures, the Iroquois' spiritual beliefs changed over time and varied across tribes. Generally, the Iroquois believed in numerous deities, including the Great Spirit, the Thunderer, and the Three Sisters (the spirits of beans, maize, and squash). The Great Spirit was thought to have created plants, animals, and humans to control \"the forces of good in nature\", and to guide ordinary people. Orenda was the Iroquoian name for the magical potence found in people and their environment. The Iroquois believed in the \"orenda\", the spiritual force that flowed all things, and believed if people were respectful of nature, then the \"orenda\" would harnessed to bring about positive results. There were three types of spirits for the Iroquois: 1) Those living on the earth 2) Those living above the earth and 3) the highest level of spirits controlling the universe from high above with the most highest being known variously as the Great Spirit, the Great Creator or the Master of Life.\n\nSources provide different stories about Iroquois creation beliefs. Brascoupé and Etmanskie focus on the first person to walk the earth, called the Skywoman or Aientsik. Aientsik's daughter Tekawerahkwa gave birth to twins, Tawiskaron, who created vicious animals and river rapids, while Okwiraseh created \"all that is pure and beautiful\". After a battle where Okwiraseh defeated Tawiskaron, Tawiskaron was confined to \"the dark areas of the world\", where he governed the night and destructive creatures. Other scholars present the \"twins\" as the Creator and his brother, Flint. The Creator was responsible for game animals, while Flint created predators and disease. Saraydar (1990) suggests the Iroquois do not see the twins as polar opposites but understood their relationship to be more complex, noting \"Perfection is not to be found in gods or humans or the worlds they inhabit.\"\n\nDescriptions of Iroquois spiritual history consistently refer to dark times of terror and misery prior to the Iroquois Confederacy, ended by the arrival of the Great Peacemaker. Tradition asserts that the Peacemaker demonstrated his authority as the Creator's messenger by climbing a tall tree above a waterfall, having the people cut down the tree, and reappearing the next morning unharmed. The Peacemaker restored mental health to a few of the most \"violent and dangerous men\", Ayonhwatha and Thadodaho, who then helped him bear the message of peace to others. \n\nAfter the arrival of the Europeans, some Iroquois became Christians, among them the first Native American Saint, Kateri Tekakwitha, a young woman of Mohawk-Algonquin parents. The Seneca sachem Handsome Lake, also known as Ganeodiyo, introduced a new religious system to the Iroquois in the late 18th century, which incorporated Quaker beliefs along with traditional Iroquoian culture. Handsome Lake's teachings include a focus on parenting, appreciation of life, and peace. A key aspect of Handsome Lake's teachings is the principle of equilibrium, wherein each person's talents combined into a functional community. By the 1960s, at least 50% of Iroquois followed this religion.\n\nDreams play a significant role in Iroquois spirituality, providing information about a person's desires and prompting individuals to fulfill dreams. To communicate upward, humans can send prayers to spirits by burning tobacco.\n\nIroquois ceremonies are primarily concerned with farming, healing, and thanksgiving. Key festivals correspond to the agricultural calendar, and include Maple, Planting, Strawberry, Green Maize, Harvest, and Mid-Winter (or New Year's), which is held in early February. The ceremonies were given by the Creator to the Iroquois to balance good with evil. In the 17th century, Europeans described the Iroquois as having 17 festivals, but only 8 are observed today. The most important of the ceremonies were the New Year Festival, the Maple Festival held in late March to celebrate spring, the Sun Shooting Festival which also celebrates spring, the Seed Dance in May to celebrate the planting of the crops, the Strawberry Festival in June to celebrate the ripening of the strawberries, the Thunder Ceremony to bring rain in July, the Green Bean Festival in early August, the Green Corn Festival in late August and the Harvest Festival in October. Of all the festivals, the most important were the Green Corn Festival to celebrate the maturing of the corn and the New Year Festival. During all of the festivals, men and women from the False Face Society, the Medicine Society and the Husk Face Society would dance wearing their masks in attempt to humor the spirits that controlled nature. The most important of the occasions for the masked dancers to appear were the New Year Festival, which was felt to be an auspicious occasion to chase the malevolent spirits that were believed to cause disease.\n\nDuring healing ceremonies, a carved \"False Face Mask\" is worn to represent spirits in a tobacco-burning and prayer ritual. False Face Masks are carved in living trees, then cut free to be painted and decorated. False Faces represent grandfathers of the Iroquois, and are thought to reconnect humans and nature and to frighten illness-causing spirits. The False Face Society continues today among modern Iroquois. The Iroquois have three different medical societies. The False Face Company conducts rituals to cure sick people by driving away spirits; the Husk Face Society is made up of those had dreams seen as messages from the spirits and the Secret Medicine Society likewise conducts rituals to cure the sick. There are 12 different types of masks worn by the societies. The types of masks are\nA) \"The Secret Society of Medicine Men and the Company of Mystic Animals\"\n1) Divided mask that painted half black and half red.\n2) Masks with exaggerated long noses.\n3) Horn masks\n4) Blind masks without eye sockets.\nB) \"Husk Face Society\"\n5) Masks made of braided corn\nC) \"False Face Society\"\n6) Whistling masks\n7) Masks with smiling faces.\n8) Masks with protruding tongues.\n9) Masks with exaggerated hanging mouths.\n10) Masks with exaggerated straight lops.\n11) Masks with spoon-lips.\n12) Masks with a disfigured twisted mouth.\nThe \"crooked face\" masks with the twisted mouths, the masks with the spoon lips and the whistling masks are the Doctor masks. The other masks are \"Common Face\" or \"Beggar\" masks that are worn by those who help the Doctors. The Husk Face Society performs rituals to communicate with the spirits in nature to ensure a good crop, the False Face Society performs rituals to chase away evil spirits and the Secret Medicine Society performs rituals to cure diseases. The grotesque masks represent the faces of the spirits that the dancers are attempting to please. Those wearing Doctor masks blow hot ashes into the faces of the sick to chase away the evil spirits that are believed to be causing the illness. The masked dancers often carried turtle shell rattles and long staffs.\n\nCondolence ceremonies are conducted by the Iroquois for both ordinary and important people, but most notably when sachems died. Such ceremonies were still held on Iroquois reservations as late as the 1970s. After death, the soul is thought to embark on a journey, undergo a series of ordeals, and arrive in the sky world. This journey is thought to take one year, during which the Iroquois mourn for the dead. After the mourning period, a feast is held to celebrate the soul's arrival in the skyworld.\n\n\"Keepers of the faith\" are part-time specialists who conduct religious ceremonies. Both men and women can be appointed as keepers of the faith by tribe elders.\n\nThe Iroquois traditionally celebrate six major festivals throughout the year. These usually combine a spiritual component and ceremony, a feast, a chance to celebrate together, sports, entertainment and dancing. These celebrations have historically been oriented to the seasons and celebrated based on the cycle of nature rather than fixed calendar dates.\n\nFor instance, the Mid-winter festival, \"Gi'-ye-wä-no-us-quä-go-wä\" (\"The supreme belief\") ushers in the new year. This festival is traditionally held for one week around the end of January to early February, depending on when the new moon occurs that year.\n\nIroquois art from the 16th and 17th centuries as found on bowls, pottery and clay pipes show a mixture of animal, geometrical and human imagery. Moose hair was sometimes attached to tumplines or burden straps for decorative effect. Porcupine quillwork was sewn onto bags, clothing and moccasins, usually in geometrical designs. Other designs included the \"great turtle\" upon North America was said to rest; the circular \"skydome\" and wavy designs. Beads and clothes often featured semi-circles and waves which meant to represent the \"skydome\" which consisted of the entire universe together with the supernatural world above it, parallel lines for the earth and curved lines for the \"celestial tree\". Floral designs were first introduced in the 17th century, reflecting French influence, but did not become truly popular until the 19th century. Starting about 1850 the Iroquois art began to frequently feature floral designs on moccasins, caps, pouches and pincushions, which were purchased by Euro-Americans. The British historian Michael Johnson described the Iroquois artwork meant to be sold to whites in the 19th century as having a strong feel of \"Victoriana\" to them. Silver was much valued by the Iroquois from the 17th century onward, and starting in the 18th century, the Iroquois became \"excellent silversmiths\", making silver earrings, gorgets and rings.\n\nThe favorite sport of the Iroquois was \"lacrosse\" (O-tä-dä-jish′-quä-äge in Seneca). This version was played between two teams of six or eight players, made up of members of two sets of clans (Wolf, Bear, Beaver, and Turtle on one side vs. Deer, Snipe, Heron, and Hawk on the other among the Senecas). The goals were two sets of poles roughly apart. The poles were about high and placed about apart. A goal was scored by carrying or throwing a deer-skin ball between the goal posts using netted sticks—touching the ball with hands was prohibited. The game was played to a score of five or seven. The modern version of lacrosse remains popular as of 2015.\n\nA popular winter game was the \"snow-snake game\". The \"snake\" was a hickory pole about long and about in diameter, turned up slightly at the front and weighted with lead. The game was played between two sides of up to six players each, often boys, but occasionally between the men of two clans. The snake, or Gawa′sa, was held by placing the index finger against the back end and balancing it on the thumb and other fingers. It was not thrown but slid across the surface of the snow. The side whose snake went the farthest scored one point. Other snakes from the same side which went farther than any other snake of the opposing side also scored a point; the other side scored nothing. This was repeated until one side scored the number of points which had been agreed to for the game, usually seven or ten.\n\nThe \"Peach-stone game\" (Guskä′eh) was a gambling game in which the clans bet against each other. Traditionally it was played on the final day of the Green Corn, Harvest, and Mid-winter festivals. The game was played using a wooden bowl about one foot in diameter and six peach-stones (pits) ground to oval shape and burned black on one side. A \"bank\" of beans, usually 100, was used to keep score and the winner was the side who won them all. Two players sat on a blanket-covered platform raised a few feet off the floor. To play the peach stones were put into the bowl and shaken. Winning combinations were five of either color or six of either color showing.\n\nPlayers started with five beans each from the bank. The starting player shook the bowl; if he shook a five the other player paid him one bean, if a six five beans. If he shook either he got to shake again. If he shook anything else the turn passed to his opponent. All his winnings were handed over to a \"manager\" or \"managers\" for his side. If a player lost all of his beans another player from his side took his place and took five beans from the bank. Once all beans had been taken from the bank the game continued, but with the draw of beans now coming from the winnings of the player's side, which were kept out of sight so that no one but the managers knew how the game was going. The game was finished when one side had won all the beans.\n\nThe game sometimes took quite a while to play, depending on the starting number of beans, and games lasting more than a day were common.\n\nThe First Nations Lacrosse Association is recognized by the Federation of International Lacrosse as a sovereign state for international lacrosse competitions. It is the only sport in which the Iroquois field national teams and the only indigenous people's organization sanctioned for international competition by any world sporting governing body.\n\nEach clan has a group of personal names which may be used to name members. The clan mother is responsible for keeping track of those names not in use, which may then be reused to name infants. When a child becomes an adult he takes a new \"adult\" name in place of his \"baby\" name. Some names are reserved for chiefs or faith keepers, and when a person assumes that office he takes the name in a ceremony in which he is considered to \"resuscitate\" the previous holder. If a chief resigns or is removed he gives up the name and resumes his previous one.\n\nAlthough the Iroquois are sometimes mentioned as examples of groups who practiced cannibalism, the evidence is mixed as to whether such a practice could be said to be widespread among the Six Nations, and to whether it was a notable cultural feature. Some anthropologists have found evidence of ritual torture and cannibalism at Iroquois sites, for example, among the Onondaga in the sixteenth century. However, other scholars, most notably anthropologist William Arens in his controversial book, \"The Man-Eating Myth\", have challenged the evidence, suggesting the human bones found at sites point to funerary practices, asserting that if cannibalism was practiced among the Iroquois, it was not widespread. Modern anthropologists seem to accept the probability that cannibalism did exist among the Iroquois, with Thomas Abler describing the evidence from the Jesuit Relations and archaeology as making a \"case for cannibalism in early historic times ... so strong that it cannot be doubted.\" Scholars are also urged to remember the context for a practice that now shocks the modern Western society. Sanday reminds us that the ferocity of the Iroquois' rituals \"cannot be separated from the severity of conditions ... where death from hunger, disease, and warfare became a way of life\".\n\nThe missionaries Johannes Megapolensis, François-Joseph Bressani, and the fur trader Pierre-Esprit Radisson present first-hand accounts of cannibalism among the Mohawk. A common theme is ritualistic roasting and eating the heart of a captive who has been tortured and killed. \"To eat your enemy is to perform an extreme form of physical dominance.\"\n\nAs mentioned above in section 5.1 War, Haudenosaunee peoples participated in “mourning wars” to obtain captives. Leland Donald suggests in “Slavery in Indigenous North America” that captives and slaves were interchangeable roles. There have been archaeological studies to support that Haudenosaunee peoples did in fact have a hierarchal system that included slaves. Note that the term slave in Haudenosaunee culture is identified by spiritual and revengeful purposes, not to be mistaken for the term slave in the African Slave Trade.\n\nCapture\n\nTo obtain slaves, Haudenosaunee peoples battled in “mourning wars”. After the wars were over, Haudenosaunee warriors journeyed back to their villages with the new slaves they had captured. During these journeys, slaves were routinely tortured or even killed by their captors. Leland Donald writes that captives “were killed if they could not keep up, tried to escape, or members of the attacking party could not restrain their emotions”. Daniel Richter suggests that keeping the pace may not have been an easy task, writing that “warriors might slowly lead prisoners by a rope between the lines of men, women and children [captives]”. If a prisoner survived all the obstacles on the march back to a Haudenosaunee village, the torture did not end. Slaves were mutilated and beaten for several days upon arrival by Haudenosaunee warriors. After the initiation process, slaves were either killed, or welcomed into the nation where they would be replacing a deceased member of that community.\n\nAdoption Policy\n\nSlaves brought onto Haudenosaunee territory were mainly adopted into families or kin groups that had lost a person. Although if that person had been vital for the community they “were usually replaced by other kin-group members” and “captives were…adopted to fill lesser places”. During adoption rituals, slaves were to reject their former life and be renamed as part of their “genuine assimilation”. The key goal of Haudenosaunee slavery practices was to have slaves assimilate to Haudenosaunee culture to rebuild population after one or many deaths. Childrenand Indigenous peoples of neighbouring villages to the Haudenosaunee are said to have been good slaves because of their better ability to assimilate. That being said, the role of a slave was not a limited position and whenever slaves were available for capture they were taken, no matter their age, race, gender etc.\n\nOnce adopted, slaves in Haudenosaunee communities had potential to move up in society. Since slaves were replacing dead nation members, they took on the role of that former member if they could prove that they could live up to it. Their rights within the aforementioned framework were still limited though, meaning slaves performed chores or labor for their adoptive families. Also, there are a few cases where slaves were never adopted into families and their only role was to perform tasks in the village. These types of slaves may have been used solely for exchange. Slave trade was common in Haudenosaunee culture and it aimed to increase Haudenosaunee population.\n\nTorture\n\nSlaves were often tortured once captured by the Haudenosaunee. Torture methods consisted of, most notably, finger mutilation, among other things. Slaves endured torture not only on their journey back to Haudenosaunee nations, but also during initiation rituals and sometimes throughout their enslavement. Finger mutilation was common as a sort of marking of a slave. In \"Northern Iroquoian Slavery\", Starna and Watkins suggest that sometimes torture was so brutal that captives died before being adopted. Initial torture upon entry into the Haudenosaunee culture also involved binding, bodily mutilation with weapons, and starvation, and for female slaves: sexual assault. Starvation may have lasted longer depending on the circumstance. Louis Hennepin was captured by Haudenosaunee peoples in the 17 Century and recalled being starved during his adoption as one of \"Aquipaguetin\"’s replacement sons. Indigenous slaves were also starved by their captors, such as Louis Hennepin was. If torture lead to the slave’s death, often times Haudenosaunee peoples ate the victim. The brutality of Haudenosaunee slavery wasn’t without its purposes though; torture was used to demonstrate a power dynamic between the slave and the “master” to constantly remind the slave that they were inferior.\n\nLanguage\n\nLanguage played another role in Haudenosaunee slavery practices. Slaves were often referred to as \"domestic animals\" or \"dogs\" which were equivalent to the word to \"slave\". This use of language suggests that slaves were dehumanized, that slaves were \"domesticated\" and another that slaves were to be eaten as Haudenosaunee peoples ate dogs. Jaques Bruyas wrote a dictionary of the Mohawk language where the word “Gatsennen” is defined as \"Animal domestique, serviteur, esclave\" the English translation being \"domestic animal, butler, slave\". There are also more language accounts of slaves being compared to animals (mostly dogs) in Oneida and Onondaga language. This language not only serves as a proof that slavery did exist, but also that slaves were at the bottom of the hierarchy.\n\nChanges After Contact\n\nInevitably, Haudenosaunee slavery practices changed after European contact. With the arrival of European diseases came the increase in Haudenosaunee peoples obtaining captives as their population kept decreasing. During the 17 Century, Haudenosaunee peoples banded together to stand against settlers. By the end of the century, Haudenosaunee populations were mostly made up of captives from other nations. Among the Indigenous groups targeted by the Haudenosaunee were the Wyandot who were captured in such large numbers that they lost their independence for a large period of time. “Mourning wars” became essential to rebuild numbers, but also Haudenosaunee warriors began targeting French and later English colonizers. Similarly to Indigenous slaves, European slaves were tortured by the Haudenosaunee using finger mutilation and sometimes cannibalism. European captives did not make for good slaves though because they resisted even more so than Indigenous captives and they did not understand rituals such as renaming and forgetting their past. For this reason most European captives were either used as ransom or murdered upon arrival to Haudenosaunee territory. A lot of Europeans were not captured though, and instead they became trading partners with the Haudenosaunee. Indigenous slaves were now being traded amongst European settlers and some slaves even ended up in Quebec households. In the end, European contact lead to adoptees outnumbering the Haudenosaunee in their own communities, these slaves were too hard to control in large numbers and so came the finality of Haudenosaunee slavery practices.\n\nThe first five nations listed below formed the original Five Nations (listed from east to west, as they were oriented to the sunrise); the Tuscarora became the sixth nation in 1722.\n\nWithin each of the six nations, people belonged to a number of matrilineal clans. The number of clans varies by nation, currently from three to eight, with a total of nine different clan names.\n\nAccording to the Worldmark Encyclopedia of Cultures and Daily Life, The Iroquois Confederacy had 10,000 people at its peak, but by the 18th century, their population had decreased to 4,000, recovering only to 7,000 by 1910.\n\nAccording to data compiled in 1995 by Doug George-Kanentiio, a total of 51,255 Six Nations people lived in Canada. These included 15,631 Mohawk in Quebec; 14,051 Mohawk in Ontario; 3,970 Oneida in Ontario; and a total of 17,603 of the Six Nations at the Grand River Reserve in Ontario. More recently according to the Six Nations Elected Council, some 12,436 on the Six Nations of the Grand River reserve, the largest First Nations reserve in Canada, as of December 2014 and 26,034 total in Canada.\n\nIn 1995, tribal registrations among the Six Nations in the United States numbered about 30,000 in total, with the majority of 17,566 in New York. The remainder were more than 10,000 Oneida in Wisconsin, and about 2200 Seneca-Cayuga in Oklahoma. As the nations individually determine their rules for membership or citizenship, they report the official numbers. (Some traditional members of the nations refuse to be counted.) There is no federally recognized Iroquois nation or tribe, nor are any Native Americans enrolled as Iroquois.\n\nIn the 2000 United States census, 80,822 people identified as having Iroquois ethnicity (which is similar to identifying as European), with 45,217 claiming only Iroquois ancestry. There are the several reservations in New York: Cayuga Nation of New York(~450,) St. Regis Mohawk Reservation (3248 in 2014), Onondaga Reservation (473 in 2014), Oneida Indian Nation (~ 1000), Seneca Nation of New York (~8000) and the Tuscarora Reservation (1100 in 2010). Some lived at the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin on the reservation there counting some 21,000 according to the 2000 census. Seneca-Cayuga Nation in Oklahoma has more than 5,000 people in 2011. In the 2010 Census, 81,002 persons identified as Iroquois, and 40,570 as Iroquois only across the United States. Including the Iroquois in Canada, the total population numbered over 125,000 as of 2009.\n\n\nThe \"Grand Council of the Six Nations\" is an assembly of 56 \"Hoyenah\" (chiefs) or sachems. Today, the seats on the Council are distributed among the Six Nations as follows:\nWhen anthropologist Lewis Henry Morgan studied the Grand Council in the 19th century, he interpreted it as a central government. This interpretation became influential, but Richter argues that while the Grand Council served an important ceremonial role, it was not a government in the sense that Morgan thought. According to this view, Iroquois political and diplomatic decisions are made on the local level, and are based on assessments of community consensus. A central government that develops policy and implements it for the people at large is not the Iroquois model of government.\n\nUnanimity in public acts was essential to the Council. In 1855, Minnie Myrtle observed that no Iroquois treaty was binding unless it was ratified by 75% of the male voters and 75% of the mothers of the nation. In revising Council laws and customs, a consent of two-thirds of the mothers was required. The need for a double supermajority to make major changes made the Confederacy a \"de facto\" consensus government.\n\nThe women traditionally held real power, particularly the power to veto treaties or declarations of war. The members of the Grand Council of Sachems were chosen by the mothers of each clan. If any leader failed to comply with the wishes of the women of his tribe and the Great Law of Peace, the mother of his clan could demote him, a process called \"knocking off the horns\". The deer antlers, an emblem of leadership, were removed from his headgear, thus returning him to private life.\n\nCouncils of the mothers of each tribe were held separately from the men's councils. The women used men as runners to send word of their decisions to concerned parties, or a woman could appear at the men's council as an orator, presenting the view of the women. Women often took the initiative in suggesting legislation.\n\nThe term \"wampum\" refers to beads made from purple and white mollusk shells on threads of elm bark. Species used to make wampum include the highly prized quahog clam (\"Mercenaria mercenaria\") which produces the famous purple colored beads. For white colored beads the shells from the channeled whelk (\"Busycotypus canaliculatus\"), knobbed whelk (\"Busycon carica\"), lightning whelk (\"Sinistrofulgur perversum\"), and snow whelk (\"Sinistrofulgur laeostomum\") are used.\n\nWampum was primarily used to make wampum belts by the Iroquois, which Iroquois tradition claims was invented by Hiawatha to console chiefs and clan mothers who lost family members to war. Wampum belts played a major role in the Condolence Ceremony and in the raising of new chiefs. Wampum belts are used to signify the importance of a specific message being presented. Treaty making often involved wampum belts to signify the importance of the treaty. A famous example is \"The Two Row Wampum\" or \"Guesuenta\", meaning \"it brightens our minds\", which was originally presented to the Dutch settlers, and then French, representing a canoe and a sailboat moving side-by-side along the river of life, not interfering with the other's course. All non-Native settlers are, by associations, members of this treaty. Both chiefs and clan mothers wear wampum belts as symbol of their offices.\n\n\"The Covenant Belt\" was presented to the Iroquois at the signing of the Canandaigua Treaty. The belt has a design of thirteen human figures representing symbolically the Thirteen Colonies of the United States. The house and the two figures directly next to the house represent the Iroquois people and the symbolic longhouse. The figure on the left of the house represent the Seneca Nation who are the symbolic guardians of the western door (western edge of Iroquois territory) and the figure to the right of the house represents the Mohawk who are the keepers of the eastern door (eastern edge of Iroquois territory).\n\nThe Hiawatha belt is the national belt of the Iroquois and is represented in the Iroquois Confederacy flag. The belt has four squares and a tree in the middle which represents the original five nations of the Iroquois. Going from left to right the squares represent the Seneca, Cayuga, Oneida and Mohawk. The Onondaga are represented by an eastern white pine which represents the Tree of Peace. Traditionally the Onondaga are the peace keepers of the confederacy. The placement of the nations on the belt represents the actually geographical distribution of the six nations over their shared territory, with the Seneca in the far west and the Mohawk in the far east of Iroquois territory.\n\nThe Haudenosaunee flag created in the 1980s is based on the Hiawatha Belt ... created from purple and white wampum beads centuries ago to symbolize the union forged when the former enemies buried their weapons under the Great Tree of Peace.\" It represents the original five nations that were united by the Peacemaker and Hiawatha. The tree symbol in the center represents an Eastern White Pine, the needles of which are clustered in groups of five.\n\nHistorians in the 20th century have suggested the Iroquois system of government influenced the development of the United States's government. Contact between the leaders of the English colonists and the Iroquois started with efforts to form an alliance via the use of treaty councils. Prominent individuals such as Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson were often in attendance. Bruce Johansen proposes that the Iroquois had a representative form of government. The Six Nations' governing committee was elected by the men and women of the tribe, one member from each of the six nations. Giving each member the same amount of authority in the council ensured no man received too much power, providing some of the same effect as the United States's future system of checks and balances.\n\nConsensus has not been reached on how influential the Iroquois model was to the development of United States' documents such as the Articles of Confederation and the U.S. Constitution. The influence thesis has been discussed by historians such as Donald Grinde and Bruce Johansen. In 1988, the United States Congress passed a resolution to recognize the influence of the Iroquois League upon the Constitution and Bill of Rights. In 1987, Cornell University held a conference on the link between the Iroquois' government and the U.S. Constitution.\n\nScholars such as Jack N. Rakove challenge this thesis. Stanford University historian Rakove writes, \"The voluminous records we have for the constitutional debates of the late 1780s contain no significant references to the Iroquois\" and notes that there are ample European precedents to the democratic institutions of the United States. Historian Francis Jennings noted that supporters of the thesis frequently cite the following statement by Benjamin Franklin, made in a letter from Benjamin Franklin to James Parker in 1751: \"It would be a very strange thing, if six Nations of ignorant savages should be capable of forming a Scheme for such a Union ... and yet that a like union should be impracticable for ten or a Dozen English Colonies,\" but he disagrees that it establishes influence. Rather, he thinks Franklin was promoting union against the \"ignorant savages\" and called the idea \"absurd\".\n\nThe anthropologist Dean Snow has stated that although Franklin's Albany Plan may have drawn inspiration from the Iroquois League, there is little evidence that either the Plan or the Constitution drew substantially from that source. He argues that \"... such claims muddle and denigrate the subtle and remarkable features of Iroquois government. The two forms of government are distinctive and individually remarkable in conception.\"\n\nSimilarly, the anthropologist Elizabeth Tooker has concluded that \"there is virtually no evidence that the framers borrowed from the Iroquois.\" She argues that the idea is a myth resulting from a claim made by linguist and ethnographer J.N.B. Hewitt that was exaggerated and misunderstood after his death in 1937. According to Tooker, the original Iroquois constitution did not involve representative democracy and elections; deceased chiefs' successors were selected by the most senior woman within the hereditary lineage in consultation with other women in the tribe.\n\nThe Grand Council of the Iroquois Confederacy declared war on Germany in 1917 during World War I and again in 1942 in World War II.\n\nThe Haudenosaunee government has issued passports since 1923, when Haudenosaunee authorities issued a passport to Cayuga statesman Deskaheh (Levi General) to travel to the League of Nations headquarters.\n\nMore recently, passports have been issued since 1997. Before 2001 these were accepted by various nations for international travel, but with increased security concerns across the world since the September 11 attacks, this is no longer the case. \nIn 2010, the Iroquois Nationals lacrosse team was allowed by the U.S. to travel on their own passports to the 2010 World Lacrosse Championship in England only after the personal intervention of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. However, the British government refused to recognize the Iroquois passports and denied the team members entry into the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Onondaga Nation spent $1.5 million on a subsequent upgrade to the passports designed to meet 21st-century international security requirements.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "228491", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=228491", "title": "Jubilee (biblical)", "text": "Jubilee (biblical)\n\nThe Jubilee ( \"yōḇel;\" Yiddish: \"yoyvl\") is the year at the end of seven cycles of \"shmita\" (Sabbatical years), and according to Biblical regulations had a special impact on the ownership and management of land in the Land of Israel; there is some debate whether it was the 49th year (the last year of seven sabbatical cycles, referred to as the Sabbath's Sabbath), or whether it was the following (50th) year. Jubilee deals largely with land, property, and property rights. According to Leviticus, slaves and prisoners would be freed, debts would be forgiven, and the mercies of God would be particularly manifest. states:\nThe biblical rules concerning Sabbatical years (\"shmita\") are still observed by many religious Jews in Israel, but the regulations for the Jubilee year have not been observed for many centuries. According to the Torah, observance of Jubilee only applies when the Jewish people live in the land of Israel according to their tribes. Thus, with the exile of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh (about 600 BCE), Jubilee has not been applicable.\n\nThe Septuagint rendered the Hebrew \"yovel\" as \"a trumpet-blast of liberty\" (ἀφέσεως σημασία \"afeseos semasia\"), and the Vulgate by Latin \"iobeleus\". Traditionally, it was thought that the English term \"Jubilee\" derives from the Hebrew term \"yobel\" (via Latin \"\"), which in turn derives from \"yobhel\", meaning \"ram\"; the Jubilee year was announced by a blast on a shofar, an instrument made from a ram's horn, during that year's Yom Kippur.\n\nAn alternative etymology notes that the Latin verb \"iūbilō\", \"shout for joy,\" predates the Vulgate, and proposes that instead the Latin \"jubilo\" (meaning \"shout\"), as well as Middle Irish \"ilach\" (victory cry), New English \"yowl\", and Ancient Greek \"iuzo\" (ἰύζω: shout), derived from the Proto-Indo-European root \"*yu-\" (shout for joy). In this theory, the Hebrew term for \"jubilee\" is a borrowing from neighboring Indo-European languages, rather than deriving from another Hebrew word.\n\nAncient Near Eastern societies regularly declared noncommercial debts void, typically at the coronation of a new king or at the king’s order. Biblical scholars once argued that the Jubilee was an obvious development of the Sabbatical year. Rather than waiting for the 50th or 49th year, the Deuteronomic Code requires that Hebrew slaves be liberated during their 7th year of service, as does the Covenant Code, which some textual scholars regard as pre-dating the Holiness code; the Book of Ezekiel, which some textual scholars also regard as earlier than the Holiness Code, refers to a \"year of liberty\" (שנת דרור), during which property is returned to the original owner (or their heirs), (earlier written mentioning in Sum: ama-gi, ama-ar-gi, 'return to the mother') but the word דרור is used by Jeremiah to describe the release of slaves during the Sabbatical year, which various scholars take to imply that Ezekiel must have been referring to the sabbatical year. Scholars suspect that the transfer of these regulations to 49th or 50th year was a deliberate attempt to parallel the fact that Shavuot is 50 days after Passover, and follows seven weeks of harvest; this parallel is regarded as significant in Kabbalah.\n\nAccording to the theories of Julius Wellhausen and others who have followed his approach, the Biblical chapters that contain the Jubilee and Sabbatical-year legislation (chapters 25 and 27 of Leviticus) were part of the so-called \"P\" or Priestly Code that represented the last stage in the development of Israel's religion. If Wellhausen's theories of the formation of the Biblical canon were to be accepted, it would mean that these chapters necessarily were written in a late exilic or post-exilic period.\n\nWellhausen's theory that the Jubilee and Sabbatical-year legislation was written in the exilic or post-exilic period, specifically after the time of Ezekiel, has always been challenged by scholars who have maintained the traditional position of Judaism and Christianity for the Mosaic authorship of Leviticus. Recently, however, the theories of Wellhausen and others who date the Jubilee and Sabbatical-year legislation to the exilic period or later have also been challenged by scholars who generally do not have a conservative view of the Bible. Yehezekel Kaufmann has argued that the book of Ezekiel quotes from the Sabbatical and Jubilee legislation of the Book of Leviticus, which must have been in existence before Ezekiel's writings. This argument has been expanded by Risa Levitt Kohn. Kohn examined in detail the 97 terms and phrases that are shared between Ezekiel and the Priestly Code. She concludes:\nJohn Bergsma provides a further argument against an exilic or post-exilic date for the codifying of the Jubilee and Sabbatical-year legislation, saying that the \"Sitz im Leben\" (life situation) of the exilic or post-exilic period is not at all addressed by this legislation.\nBergsma therefore points out the incongruity of Wellhausen's ascribing an exilic or post-exilic date to the Jubilee and Sabbatical-year legislation, since this would conflict with the \"Sitz im Leben\" of Israel during, and after, the exile. In addition, Bergsma shows that the problem that this legislation was addressing was a problem recognized by the kings of Babylon in the second millennium BC, which naturally suggests the possibility of a much earlier date of codification. These Babylonian kings (to whom could be added Ammi-Saduqa) occasionally issued decrees for the cancellation of debts and/or the return of the people to the lands they had sold. Such \"clean slate\" decrees were intended to redress the tendency of debtors, in ancient societies, to become hopelessly in debt to their creditors, thus accumulating most of the arable land into the control of a wealthy few. The decrees were issued sporadically. Economist Michael Hudson maintains that the Biblical legislation of the Jubilee and Sabbatical years addressed the same problems encountered by these Babylonian kings, but the Biblical formulation of the laws presented a significant advance in justice and the rights of the people. This was due to the \"clean slates\" now being codified into law, rather than relying on the whim of the king. Furthermore, the regular rhythm of the Sabbatical and Jubilee years meant that everyone would know when the next release was due, thereby giving fairness and equity to both creditor and debtor. Hudson therefore maintains that not only was the Levitical legislation a significant advance over the prior attempts to deal with indebtedness, but this legislation was also eminently practical, in contradiction to many Biblical interpreters who are not economists and who have labeled it \"utopian.\"\n\nThe biblical regulations concerning the Jubilee year form part of the Holiness code, which appears in the Torah as part of the collections of laws given on Mount Sinai or Mount Horeb. According to these regulations, the Jubilee was to be sounded once 49 years had been counted, raising an ambiguity over whether the Jubilee was within the 49th year, or followed it as an intercalation in the 7-year sabbatical cycles; scholars and classical rabbinical sources are divided on the question.\n\nThe biblical requirement is that the Jubilee year was to be treated like a Sabbatical year, with the land lying fallow, but also required the compulsory return of all property to its original owners or their heirs, except the houses of laymen within walled cities, in addition to the manumission of all Israelite indentured servants.\n\nThe biblical regulations state that the land was to rest a \"Sabbath\" when the Children of Israel came to the land God was giving them Israel. The Seder Olam Rabbah (second century AD), stated that this verse meant that the counting was not to start until after the Israelites had gained control of Canaan, which the Seder Olam, based upon received tradition, placed at 14 years after their entry into the land. This interpretation has been largely adopted in later rabbinic scholarship. One reason for this interpretation of the Levitical text was that if counting started before the land was completely conquered, it would require the Israelites to return the land to the Canaanites within 50 years; similar nationalistic concerns about the impact of the Jubilee on land ownership have been raised by Zionist settlers. From a legal point of view, the Jubilee law effectively banned sale of land as fee simple, and instead land could only be leased for no more than 50 years. The biblical regulations go on to specify that the price of land had to be proportional to how many years remained before the Jubilee, with land being cheaper the closer it is to the Jubilee.\n\nSince the 49th year was already a sabbatical year, the land was required to be left fallow during it, but if the 50th year also had to be kept fallow, as the Jubilee, then no new crops would be available for two years, and only the summer fruits would be available for the following year, creating a much greater risk of starvation overall; Judah the Prince contended that the jubilee year was identical with the sabbatical 49th year. However, the majority of classical rabbis believed that the biblical phrase \"hallow the fiftieth year\", together with the biblical promise that there would be three years worth of fruit in the \"sixth year\", implies that the jubilee year was the 50th year. The opinion of the Geonim, and generally of later authorities, was that prior to the Babylonian captivity the Jubilee was the intercalation of the 50th year, but after the captivity ended the Jubilee was essentially ignored, except for the blast of the shofar, and coincided with the sabbatical 49th year; the reason was that the Jubilee was only to be observed when the Jews controlled all of Canaan, including the territories of Reuben and Gad and the eastern half-tribe of Manasseh.\n\nThe length of the Jubilee cycle continues to be of interest to modern scholarship, as does the question of the practicality of the legislation, and whether it was ever put into effect on a nationwide basis. Regarding the length of the cycle, three significant scholarly studies devoted to the Jubilee and Sabbatical years agree that it was 49 years, while disagreeing somewhat on the interpretation of the other issues involved. These major studies were those of Benedict Zuckermann, Robert North, and Jean-François Lefebvre. The reasons given by these authors to support a 49-year cycle are both textual (examining all relevant Biblical texts) and practical.\n\nCalendrical document 4Q319 from the Dead Sea Scrolls \"represents a calendrical system based on the weekly rotation of the twenty-four priestly courses during a six-year period and constructed into six consecutive Jubilees, i.e. 294 years.\".\n\nAn example of the textual argument is given by North in his comparison of with . The first passage establishes the timing, in days, for the Festival of Weeks (\"Shavuot\"), while the second prescribes the timing, in years, for the Jubilee. In the first passage, the start of counting for the Festival of Weeks is said to be \"the day after the Sabbath\" (\"mimaharat ha-shabat\", ), and is to end \"the day after the seventh Sabbath\" (\"mimaharat ha-shabat ha-sheviyit\", ). These seven weeks would constitute 49 days in most modern methods of reckoning. Nevertheless, verse 16 says that they are to be reckoned as 50 days. This method of reckoning (sometimes called \"inclusive numbering\") is fairly common in Scripture; for example, the Feast of Tabernacles is to last for seven days (), but the last day is called the eighth day (v. 36). North found this comparison between Leviticus 23 (Feast of Weeks) and Leviticus 25 (Jubilees) to be \"the strongest possible support for the \"forty-ninth\" year\" as the Jubilee year. His conclusion that the Jubilee was identical with the seventh Sabbatical year was followed by Lefebvre, for this as well as additional reasons.\n\nThe consideration that the Jubilee was identical with the seventh Sabbatical year solves the various practical problems, as also addressed by these authors. If the Jubilee were separate from, and following the seventh Sabbatical year, then there would be two fallow years in succession. Lefebvre points out, however, that there is no support in Scripture for two voluntary fallow years in succession, even though some have misinterpreted as if this refers to a Jubilee year following a Sabbatical year, which is not the sense of the passage. Lefebvre shows that this cannot be the case because planting is mentioned for the eighth year; it is the year after a Sabbath, a year in which planting and harvesting resume. Another practical problem that would occur if the Jubilee cycle were 50 years is that, after the first cycle, the Jubilee and Sabbatical cycles would be out of phase unless the seventh Sabbatical cycle was stretched to eight years. But Scripture gives no instructions for making such an adjustment. Instead, it is assumed that the two cycles will always be in phase so that the \"shofar\" can be sounded in the seventh year of the seventh Sabbatical cycle.\n\nIn contrast, the consideration that the Jubilee year is an intercalated year separate and distinct from the Sabbatical cycles resolves an issue of the requirement for observation of the Torah of both and . For in the former passage, the command is that sowing and pruning must occur for 6 consecutive years, whereas in the latter, the command is to neither sow, nor reap nor gather from untended vines in the Jubilee year. If the Jubilee year is the 50th year as confirmed by , it must necessarily be a separate year from the first 49 years comprising the whole of the first seven Sabbatical cycles, therefore it cannot be identical with the seventh Sabbatical year as 49 does not equal 50. Were the Jubilee year to be considered identical with year 1 of the following Sabbatical cycle, the requirement of observing 6 consecutive years of sowing and pruning could not be observed as only 5 years would therefore be available for sowing and reaping, not the specified six as requires. A lot of the misunderstanding is from not carefully reading the original Hebrew text. There was no requirement in the Law to observe 6 consecutive years of sowing. The command stated that you may sow for 6 years but in the 7th year the land must observe a sabbath rest. It would be a double negative to command the land to be sowed for 6 years in cases of famine and war.\n\nAlthough not cited by these authors, two historical arguments also argue for a 49-year cycle. The first is that the Samaritans celebrated a 49-year cycle. Although the Samaritans stopped counting for the Jubilee some hundreds of years ago, according to a recent report an effort is underway to determine the date when counting ceased in order to resume. The counting will again be according to a 49-year cycle. A second historical argument has been presented to the effect that the two instances of a Jubilee mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud (tractates \"Arakin\" 12a and \"Megillah\" 14b) appear to be proper historical remembrances, because the known calculation methods of rabbinic scholarship were incapable of correctly calculating the dates of the Jubilees mentioned. Rabbinic (Talmudic) scholarship always assumed non-accession reckoning for kings, whereby the first partial year of a king was double-counted both for him and as the last year of the deceased king. This reckoning would give 47 years from the Jubilee mentioned in the 18th year of Josiah (\"Megillah\" 14b) to the Jubilee that took place 14 years after Jerusalem fell to the Babylonians (\"Arakin\" 12a), whereas the correct difference was 49 years (623 BC to 574 BC). This has been presented as additional evidence that the cycle was 49 years, and further that the cycles were being measured until the last Jubilee in the days of Ezekiel, when the stipulations of the Jubilee year, long neglected except in the counting of the priests, could no longer be observed because the people were captive in a foreign land.\n\nThe Seder Olam Rabbah recognized the importance of the Jubilee and Sabbatical cycles as a long-term calendrical system, and attempted at various places to fit the Sabbatical and Jubilee years into its chronological scheme. As mentioned above, the Seder Olam put forth the idea that the counting for these cycles was deferred until 14 years after entry into the land. The reasons for this are given in Seder Olam chapter 11. In Joshua chapter 14, Caleb mentions that he was 40 years old when he was sent out as a spy in the second year in the wilderness, and his present age was 85 (Joshua 14:7,10), which meant he received his inheritance seven years after entering Canaan. Rabbi Jose assumed that everyone else received their inheritance when Caleb did, or had already received it, so that the allotment of the land to the tribes was finished at this time. Because the division of the land took seven years, the conquest that followed must also have taken seven years. \"One has to say that 14 years Israel spent at Gilgal, seven when they were conquering and seven when they were distributing.\" Then, after putting up the Tabernacle at Shiloh, \"At that moment, they started to count years for tithes, Sabbatical years, and Jubilee years.\"\n\nAnother explanation has been offered for Rabbi Jose's postponement of counting until 14 years had elapsed. In this same chapter 11 of the Seder Olam, Rabbi Jose stated (for unknown reasons) that Israel's time in its land must have lasted an integral number of Jubilee periods. If this were true, one of those periods should have ended at the beginning of the exile in 587 BC. Yet Rabbi Jose also believed that Ezekiel 40:1 marked the beginning of the seventeenth Jubilee, and this was 14 years after the city fell. In other words, the Jubilee came 14 years too late, according to the idea that the time in the land must comprise an integral number of Jubilee cycles. Rodger Young proposes that the knowledge of when a genuine Jubilee was due was the real reason for the supposition of a delay before the start of counting:\n\nThe reason for the fourteen-year delay in \"Seder ‘Olam\" 11 is that Rabbi Yose (primary author of the \"Seder ‘Olam\") had the \"idée fixe\" that the total time that Israel spent in its land must come out to an exact number of Jubilee cycles. If that had been the case, then we should have expected that 587 BC, when the exile began, would have been at the end of a Jubilee period. However, Rabbi Yose cited Ezek 40:1 as designating the time of the seventeenth Jubilee, and since he knew this was fourteen years after the city fell, he presumed that counting had been delayed for fourteen years so that he could account for the fourteen years between the fall of the city and the observance of the seventeenth Jubilee. He also mentioned the previous Jubilee, in the time of Josiah. As much as he would have liked to put these last two Jubilees fourteen years earlier in order to be consistent with his \"idée fixe\", Rabbi Yose could not do it because he knew these were historical dates, not dates that came from his own calculation. \n\nThere is, of course, an alternative account of when counting started: at the entry into the land. This follows from a straightforward reading of the relevant text in Leviticus: \nThe then spoke to Moses at Mount Sinai, saying, \"Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, 'When you come into the land which I shall give you, then the land shall have a sabbath to the . Six years you shall sow your field, and six years you shall prune your vineyard and gather in its crop, but during the seventh year the land shall have a sabbath rest, a sabbath to the . . . You are also to count off seven sabbaths of years for yourself, seven times seven years, so that you have the time of the seven sabbaths of years, \"namely\", forty-nine years. You shall then sound a ram's horn abroad on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the day of atonement you shall sound a horn all through your land. You shall thus consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim a release through the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you (Leviticus 25:1-4, 8-10, NASB).\n\nIf counting is measured back 17 cycles from Ezekiel's Jubilee that began in Tishri of 574 BC, the first year of the first cycle would have been 1406 BC. According to the religious calendar that started the year in Nisan, and in accordance with Joshua 5:10 that places the entry in the land in Nisan, Nisan of 1406 BC is the month and year when counting started. But 1406 BC is the year of entry into the land that is traditionally derived by another method, namely taking Thiele's date of 931/930 BC for the start of the divided kingdom after Solomon's death, in conjunction with 1 Kings 6:1 (Solomon's fourth year was 480th year of Exodus-era), to derive the date of the Exodus in 1446 BC. The method of determining the date of the Exodus and entry into Canaan from the Jubilee cycles is independent of the method of deriving these dates from 1 Kings 6:1, yet the two methods agree.\n\nThe text of the Book of Leviticus argues that the Jubilee existed because the land was the possession of Yahweh, and its current occupiers were merely aliens or tenants, and therefore the land should not be sold forever. Midrashic sources argue that the Jubilee was created to preserve the original division of land between the Israelite tribes, as evidenced by the rabbinical tradition that the Jubilee should not be imposed until the Israelites were in control of Canaan. Leviticus also states that the Israelites were the servants of Yahweh, which classical rabbis took as justification for the manumission of Israelite slaves at the Jubilee, using the argument that no man should have two masters, and thus, as the servants of Yahweh, the Israelites should not also be the servants of men.\n\nA further theological insight afforded by the Jubilee cycles is explained in Andrew Steinmann’s monograph on Biblical chronology. Steinmann has an extended discussion of the evidence for various pre-exilic Sabbatical years, and how they all occurred an integral number of seven-year periods before Ezekiel’s Jubilee (see the Historical Sabbatical Years article). He also notes that the date of the entry into the land implied by Ezekiel’s Jubilee (the seventeenth) is in exact agreement with the date calculated from 1 Kings 6:1 and Joshua 5:6. These chronological considerations are usually neglected in discussions of the legislation for the Jubilee and Sabbatical years, but Steinmann stresses their theological importance as follows:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27954765", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27954765", "title": "Mixed Courts of Egypt", "text": "Mixed Courts of Egypt\n\nThe Mixed Courts of Egypt (, transliterated: \"Al-Maḥākim al-Mukhṭaliṭah\") () were founded in October 1875 by the Khedive Isma'il Pasha. Designed by Nubar Nubarian Pasha (January 1825, İzmir, Ottoman Empire – January 14, 1899, Paris) to be part of the Khedive's great plans for Egypt, the Mixed Courts led to a radical reform of Egypt's chaotic nineteenth century legal system, where Consular courts competed with Government tribunals and religious courts for jurisdiction. The completion of the Suez Canal (1869) and the development of the cotton trade had attracted many foreign interests and foreign nationals to Egypt.\n\nThe Mixed Courts had Codes, based on a civil law format inspired by the French Civil Code and British common law but with significant Islamic and local principles. Without suppressing the Consular courts which would have been diplomatically impossible the Mixed Courts were intended to streamline legal issues between foreign nationals, and between foreigners and Egyptians. Three courts were established in Cairo, Mansoura and in Alexandria; the proceedings were held in French. Judges were appointed by the Khedive from leading Egyptian and foreign candidates. \"The judiciary was at all times under the authority of the rulers of Egypt.\" There were three districts.\n\nThe establishment of the courts, hearing disputes between Egyptians and foreigners and between foreigners of different nationalities, was so successful that new, so-called Native courts were set up in 1883, after the British Occupation of 1882. The 1883 Codes were based on those of 1875, and the judges, mostly Egyptian, tended to follow the Mixed Courts’ interpretation of the law.\n\nThe Mixed Courts, by being the foremost judicial authority between 1875 and 1949 (when their functions were transferred to new National Courts) sat in times of political and social change in Egypt. Their decisions reflect the human and commercial history of the area, and involved complicated issues of law. The problems of sovereign immunity, sequestration of enemy property, international banking and maritime commerce were shadowed by the recognition and enforcement of divorces, legitimacy, and marriage contracts affecting people of different religions and nationalities. In between were a whole range of the usual types of legal disputes, such as trademarks and patents, and industrial injuries, without any developed theories at all that could be drawn upon for inspiration, either from inside or outside the country.\n\nWhat, if anything, did the Mixed Courts contribute to the present Egyptian codes? \"The laws that were administered by the courts were now divided into 5 codes: (1) the Civil Code, (2) the Commercial Code, (3) the Maritime Code, (4) the Code of Procedure as regards the foregoing Codes, (5) the Penal Code.\" The greatest change in 1949 was the Civil Code. The Maritime and the Commerce Codes were the old ones retained from 1883, and the Penal Code had been gradually updated.\n\nThe Criminal Codes differed from the other codes because it was only administered by the Mixed Courts to a slight extent; \"because foreign governments were not willing to abandon their Civil Jurisdiction of their Consuls, therefore they were unwilling to give up the Criminal Code. This resulted in a compromise and what led to the Mixed Courts having very limited Jurisdiction in Criminal Matters. It only extended to simple police cases (contraventions), and to (1) offenses committed directly against the judges and officers of the Courts while in the exercise of their functions, as force or violence or bribery; (2) offense committed directly against the execution of the judgements of the Courts; (3) crimes imputed to judges and officers of the Courts, when they have committed them in the exercise of their functions, or in abusing their functions. The greater number of cases were still heard by the Consular Courts.\"\n\nWell before the closure of the Mixed Courts Abd El-Razzak El-Sanhuri Pasha was appointed as chairman of the Committee set up to draft a new Civil Code. He was assisted by many Egyptian jurists, and also by E Lambert, the French jurist. The result of this work was the 1949 Egyptian civil code, of 1149 Articles. The background to this eclectic and monumental work has already been described by Sanhouri himself. The 1949 Code was based on a mixture of the previous Mixed and Native codes, together with Egyptian jurisprudence, the Shari’a and various foreign codes from nearly 20 countries. The code was specifically drafted with the Shari’a in mind so that non-Islamic provisions were not consistent with it.\n\nThus it may be seen that the custom of the country was upheld as a source of law, and natural law and equity, a major basis of Mixed Court jurisprudence, were both expressly included. In recent years, however, the overriding factor has been Islamic law, and this is now enshrined in the 1971 Constitution, as amended. The Shari’a is the principal source of legislation, and thus it follows that a more “Islamic” interpretation of the law will be in evidence. The Mixed Courts interpreted their codes in an Egyptian manner; the difference now is that an Islamic view, rather than simply an Egyptian one, will be taken, even though it can be argued that as the quality and confidence of the Egyptian judiciary grew in the years to 1949 the type of natural law and equity which was applied in the Mixed Courts was likely to be a blend of Muslim and Christian principles that eventually became more Muslim than Christian. The judges were not simply technicians, but interpreted rules, customs, and laws to give justice in Egypt. The 1949 code confirmed or re-established the Islamic viewpoint, and can be seen as influenced by the Mixed Courts jurisprudence only indirectly.\n\nThe Mixed Courts were established in 1875 to reform a chaotic situation. Their immediate effect was to make the Capitulatory Regime in Egypt less intolerable, because their establishment cured many ills, and stopped the fraudulent pursuit of claims by foreigners against the Egyptian government and other public Egyptian organisations.\n\nA step forward in the unity of jurisdiction was the establishment of the Native courts in 1883, using codes based on the Mixed Codes. The Native courts and the Mixed Courts were national Egyptian courts. On their merger they became the National Courts.\n\nThus, giving justice in the name of Egypt, the Mixed Courts were Egyptian courts, and entitled to be regarded as such. Their codes were Egyptian codes and, together with the precedent that arose, were applied as Egyptian law to be used in the forum set aside for “mixed” disputes. There was a continuous creation, evolution, and progress in the law so that judgments were by no means restricted to simple interpretation of the relevant codes. Judgments were oriented towards the litigant. The question was, could the law help the parties and not, could the parties fit in with the written codes or existing law? People were no longer afraid of litigation, and the foremost principle of the rule of law, that no one, not even the ruler, was above the law was radical change for Egypt in the 1870s.\n\nForeign influence, and diplomatic and political claims against the Egyptian government, gave unscrupulous foreigners rights quite inconsistent with natural justice and equity. However, the establishment of the Mixed Courts reduced foreign abuse of the Egyptian system. Egypt before 1875 was a battleground of powerful forces. Foreign power was often exercised at the expense of Egyptian sovereignty. All this changed after 1875, as order grew from disorder and legal confidence was established. The Mixed Courts imposed the rule of law and thus began the transition of Egypt from a feudal country into a modern and structured state, with a legal climate conducive to commercial and social progress.\n\nOne of the reasons the judgments of the Mixed Courts were respected and trusted was that they were not seen by Egyptians as foreign law. In a slow and gradual way the consensus of Egyptian opinion shifted from favor to abolition. The Mixed Courts still had enough familiar principles to retain the confidence of the foreign community.\n\nAn efficient system of law and enforcement obviated any necessity for self-help. Egypt was a notoriously litigious country. It was to the benefit of her inhabitants from 1875 that a proper channel of dispute settlement existed between foreigners, and between foreigners and natives.\n\nParties felt that disputes should be left to settlement by the courts. They became conscious of having certain loosely defined rights. The practice of free legal aid meant that no one was denied justice through an ability to pay. Further, enforcement litigants could see that redress was available and real.\n\nThe Mixed Courts had only lasted for 74 years, an insignificant period of time in comparison to Egyptian history, but covering years of profound change in Egypt, and often initiating or facilitating such change. 1949 saw the penultimate step in providing Egypt with a unified and modernized system of law, definitely Egyptian but clearly Western influenced.\n\nThe years 1926 to 1937 were years of great change. As the period drew to a close the final chapter in the history of the Mixed Courts began. In the 1920s they had seemed set to endure forever, but by the 1930s rapid and radical political change had sounded a warning note. In many ways the Mixed Courts had themselves encouraged the critical analysis, close reasoning, and scholarly research that had led to an educated elite of lawyers in Egypt. Those trained in law were at the front of nationalism, and in a way the Mixed Courts encouraged the very freedom of thought, independence of action, and respect for a national and sovereign rule of law which fostered much of the moderate nationalist opinion. By 1937 the merger of the Mixed Courts was agreed, by 1949 it was taking place.\n\nIn essence, this was true culmination of the 1875 reforms. From the beginnings of the Mixed Courts in 1875, to the Native Courts in 1883, and the Montreux Convention reforms in 1937, the various jurisdictions of the Egyptian legal system drew closer together, while at the same time foreign consular jurisdiction lessened. Finally, the whole of Egypt's legal system became unified in 1956. The Mixed Courts paved the way for this to happen by the gradual cycle of reform, development and reform. The fusion of the Mixed and Native Courts provided an up-to-date and solid system.\n\nThe Mixed Courts established the rule of law in Egypt, developed a truly Egyptian court system and were the base on which the post-war Egyptian legal system rests. Their direct influence has waned and receded, but without their existence and work between 1875 and 1949, and without their conscientious and dedicated development and operation, the Egyptian legal system after the Second World War and until the present day would be quite different.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1782965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1782965", "title": "No-fault insurance", "text": "No-fault insurance\n\nIn its broadest sense, no-fault insurance is any type of insurance contract under which insureds are indemnified for losses by their own insurance company, regardless of fault in the incident generating losses. In this sense, it is no different from first-party coverage. However, the term \"no-fault\" is most commonly used in the context of state/provincial automobile insurance laws in the United States, Canada, and Australia, in which a policyholder (and his/her passengers) are not only reimbursed by the policyholder’s own insurance company without proof of fault, but also restricted in the right to seek recovery through the civil-justice system for losses caused by other parties.\n\nNo-fault systems generally exempt individuals from the usual liability for causing body injury if they do so in a car collision; when individuals purchase \"liability\" insurance under those regimes, the insurance covers bodily injury of the insured and the insured's passengers caused by a car collision, regardless of which party would be liable under ordinary common law tort rules. No-fault insurance has the goal of lowering premium costs by avoiding expensive litigation over the causes of the collision, while providing quick payments for injuries or loss of property. Further, no-fault systems often grant \"set\" or \"fixed\" compensation for certain injuries regardless of the unique aspects of the injury or the individual injured. Workers compensation funds typically are run as \"no fault\" systems with usually a fixed schedule for compensation for various injuries.\n\nProponents of no-fault insurance argue that automobile collisions are inevitable and that at-fault drivers are not necessarily higher risk and should not necessarily be punished; moreover, they note that the presence of liability insurance insulates reckless or negligent drivers from financial disincentives of litigation; also, uninsured motorists are often \"judgment proof\" (i.e., can't and won't end up paying for their liability anyway), so that in regions with high numbers of such uninsured motorists, no-fault systems may make more sense. Furthermore, traditional insurance is regressive because drivers of inexpensive cars are liable for damage to any car, no matter its value, even though they only add a small amount of liability to the pool with their less valuable cars. This issue is fixed under a no-fault regime.\n\nCritics of no-fault argue that dangerous drivers not paying for the damage they cause encourages excessive risky behavior, with only raised premiums and a higher risk rating as the potential consequence, and no jury awards or legal settlements. Detractors of no-fault also point out that legitimate victims with subtle handicaps find it difficult to seek recovery under no-fault. Another criticism is that some no-fault jurisdictions have among the highest automobile-insurance premiums in the country, but this may be more a matter of effect than cause (e.g., the financial savings from no-fault may simply make it more popular in areas with higher automobile-collision risk, or high insurance rates may cause more drivers to go uninsured, increasing the attraction of a no-fault system).\n\nThe number of traffic accidents causing fatalities and debilitating injuries had become by the mid-1960s the source of a litigation explosion that was \"straining (and in some areas overwhelming) the judicial machinery.\" Much legal thinking in academia was devoted to the question of whether the tort system should be replaced with another method of allocating risks of loss from accidents. Empirical analyses were published showing the financial impact of automobile accidents. The first comprehensive legislative proposal was put forward by Professors Robert E. Keeton of Harvard Law School and Jeffrey O'Connell, then of the University of Illinois, in a law review article published in the Harvard Law Review, which consisted of two chapters of the book that they would publish the following year. The Keeton-O'Connell plan provided that all automobile owners would be required to purchase a new form of insurance, called \"basic protection coverage,\" under which a victim has recourse for his net economic loss against the insurer of his own car, his host's car or, if the victim is a pedestrian, any car involved. Fault is not required to be shown except for of damages in excess of $10,000 for bodily injury, the deductible of $100 for bodily injury and property damage. Recoverable loss under this type of policy does not include pain and suffering and is reduced by damages recovered form other sources. The proposal generated immense discussion in legal and insurance publications with some concluding it was too \"revolutionary.\"\n\nIn 1967 Massachusetts state representative Michael Dukakis, a 1960 graduate of Harvard Law School, introduced a modified version of the Keeton-O'Connell plan in the Massachusetts legislature. The scheme was adopted in 1970. The law was challenged in court for claimed violations of numerous state and federal constitutional provisions. The scheme was defended by the state attorney general and also Harvard Law School professors Archibald Cox and Philip Heymann in an \"amicus curiae\" brief. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts overruled the objections in a unanimous decision. The decision opened the way for widespread adoption of no-fault automobile insurance schemes, a development that was encouraged by the federal Department of Transportation.\n\nMost U.S. states have a \"traditional tort\" liability system for auto insurance in which recovery is governed by principles of provable negligence. However, twelve U.S. states and the Commonwealth territory of Puerto Rico require policyholders to operate under a \"no-fault\" scheme in which individuals injured in automobile collisions are limited in their ability to seek recovery from other drivers or vehicle owners involved in a collision and an additional 8 states have an \"add-on\" system in which the insureds retain the right to sue. In 2012, RAND Corporation published a study which found that costs were higher in no-fault systems. In the case of economic (medical and wage-loss) damages, most no-fault systems permit injured parties to seek recovery only for damages that are not covered by available first-party insurance benefits. In the case of non-economic (pain-and-suffering) damages, most no-fault systems permit injured parties to seek compensation only in cases of exceptionally \"serious\" injury, which can be defined in either of two ways:\n\n\nIn three U.S. states – Kentucky, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania – policyholders are permitted to choose between traditional tort and no-fault recovery regimes. Under such systems, known as “choice” or “optional” no-fault, policyholders must select between “full tort” and “limited tort” (no-fault) options at the time the policy is written or renewed; once the policy terms are set forth an insured may not change his/her mind without rewriting the policy. In both Kentucky and New Jersey, policyholders who do not make an affirmative choice in favor of either full tort or limited tort are assigned the no-fault option by default; whereas in Pennsylvania, the full-tort option is the default.\n\nSeveral U.S. states have experimented with and repealed their no-fault laws. Twenty-four states originally enacted no-fault laws in some form between 1970 and 1975. Colorado repealed its no-fault system in 2003. Florida's no-fault system sunset on October 1, 2007, but the Florida legislature passed a new no-fault law which took effect January 1, 2008.\n\nIn terms of damages to vehicles and their contents, those claims are still based on fault. No-fault systems focus solely on issues of compensation for bodily injury. But it also works the other way: policies pay the medical bills for drivers and their companions independent of who was at-fault for the collision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

His parents were Hyman (Harry) Stein (1910–1980) and Sarah (Sadie) Stein née Henry (1908–1996); they had four children. Hyman Stein was a jazz musician who performed under the name Bing Stern. Stein has said, \"We were not a poor family but my father's occupation as a musician did not allow for extras or luxuries.\" The family is said to have flipped a coin as a way to decide whether to emigrate to Australia or Canada, and Australia won the toss. Stein's elder brother and sister emigrated first, settling in Sydney. Stein, with the rest of his family, followed in 1953, on the Assisted Passage Migration Scheme.\n\nBefore moving to Australia in 1953, Stein’s only experience of Andipodeans was an Australian schoolteacher who caned him for alleged cheating. Believing himself to be innocent, Stein has said of the experience, \"I was not guilty but this plain injustice may have been the trigger for my rebellious streak.\" In Sydney, Stein attended Sydney Boys High School. There, Stein reinstated the school’s football (soccer) team, which played for several years without formal recognition from the Sydney Boys High headmaster (either Gordon Barr or Kenneth John Andrews). In protest at this lack of official recognition, Stein wrote letters to the Editor of the \"Sydney Morning Herald\", and refused to wear his high school uniform blazer.\n\nStein attended the Sydney Law School, at The University of Sydney from 1957 to 1960. In his Articles of Clerkship, Stein’s master solicitor was Phillip Goldman, and later, John Pitman Webster of Uther Webster. During university Stein worked as a tram conductor in Sydney's eastern suburbs.\n\nStein was admitted to the bar in 1961. In February 1964 Stein commenced at Mena House Chambers. He was part of the establishment of Forbes Chambers, Frederick Jordan Chambers, and Wardell Chambers. Stein took silk in 1981, and was a Queen's Counsel for two years before being appointed a judge of the District Court of New South Wales.\n\nAt age thirty-eight, Stein was appointed Deputy Ombudsman of New South Wales, a position he held from 1977 to 1979. Stein was President of the New South Wales Anti-Discrimination Board from 1979 to 1982.\n\nStein held numerous board and committee appointments, with particular involvement in social justice, civil liberties, and consumer advocacy issues. He was Chair of the Australian Consumers’ Association (now known as Choice (Australian consumer organisation) from 1974 to 1986, and Acting Chair of the Juvenile Leave Review Committee between 1985 and 1988. Stein was President of the Intellectually Handicapped Persons Review Tribunal from 1983 to 1989, and Chair of the Council of the Community Justice Centres of New South Wales between 1987 and 1993. Stein was Chair of the NRMA Community Advisory Committee from 1993 to 1998, and a member of the NRMA Crime Safe Committee from 1997 to 2000.\n\nStein was Chair of the Commission of Inquiry into the ACT Leasehold System in 1995. He was a member of the Board of the State Records Authority of New South Wales from 2001 to 2003. In 2012 Stein was Chair of the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority, and Chair of the Board of Governors of the New South Wales Law and Justice Foundation.\n\nStein was appointed as a judge of the District Court of New South Wales in June 1983. In June 1985 he became a judge of the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales. Stein was appointed a judge and judge of appeal of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in April 1997. Stein sat as an acting judge on the Supreme Court of Western Australia in 2001.\n\nStein retired as a judge and judge of appeal from the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 11 April 2003. In his retirement, Stein served as an acting judge on the Supreme Court of New South Wales, and on the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Fiji. Stein worked as an independent mediator and arbitrator. Stein sits on Independent Assessment Panels for referred development applications in the municipal councils of Mosman and Manly, in Sydney. In 2011 Stein reviewed compensation claims for businesses affected by the aborted CBD Metro. He is currently Chair of the NSW Environment Protection Authority (2012), and Chair of the Board of Governors of the NSW Law and Justice Foundation (2012).\n\nAmong the contributions Stein has made to the law in his judicial career, one of the most significant is the development of the jurisprudence on ecologically sustainable development. It was the period at the Land and Environment Court where Stein made his most influential decisions, including \"State Pollution Control Commission v Caltex Refining Company Pty Ltd (1991)\", \"Corkhill v Hope (1991)\", and \"Corkhill v Forestry Commission of New South Wales (No 2) (1991)\". About the latter case, Justice James Spigelman said, \"This was the first occasion in Australia that wildlife protection law was enforced against a government authority. It laid the foundation for future statutory regimes, both in this State and at the Commonwealth level.\" In the seminal environmental law case \"Leatch v National Parks & Wildlife Service (1993)\", Stein considered Precautionary Principle; this was the first time the principle had been applied in Common law. Stein’s ability to write judgments swiftly and efficiently earned him the nickname 'Speedy' from fellow judges.\n\nOn 10 December 2009 the Law Council of Australia held the symposium, \"The future of environmental law: A symposium to mark the contribution of Paul Stein in the field of environmental and planning law\". The event included papers by Justice Peter McClellan QC, Justice Brian Preston SC, Professor Tim Bonyhady, and Emeritus Professor Ben Boer.\n\nStein has worked as a lecturer and author in the fields of local government and environmental law, and in judicial education. He was a Distinguished Visitor at Macquarie University's Centre for International and Environmental Law (MU-CIEL). Stein is a patron of the \"Macquarie Journal of International and Comparative Environmental Law\".\n\nStein was part of the United Nations Environment Programme’s (UNEP) Global Judges Symposium on Sustainable Development and the Role of Law, 2002. This resulted in the creation of a \"Judicial Portal\", designed and developed by Stein, in co-operation with the World Conservation Union (IUCN). The Judicial Portal was the world’s first Internet-based judicial communication network.\n\nAs President of the Anti-Discrimination Board, in 1980 Stein raised objections to cartoons by Eric Jolliffe, which depicted Aboriginal people. Stein argued that Jolliffe’s cartoons may cause offence because they represented Aboriginal people as intellectually inferior racial stereotypes. Also in 1980, Stein argued for the 1977 Anti-Discrimination Act to be amended to recognise discrimination on the basis of political belief, expression, and activity. A year earlier Stein rallied for discrimination law to include considerations of discrimination on the basis of disability. In 1981 the Anti-Discrimination Act 1977 was amended to recognise persons with disabilities.\n\nAlso in 1981, Stein raised concerns about the discrimination of Indo-Chinese immigrants and refugees in Australia, calling for community education and leadership from government. In 1982 Stein called for an end to discrimination against Aboriginal people by police officers and judges, citing recent studies of arrests and incarceration. One controversial recommendation by the Anti-Discrimination Board, under Stein’s leadership, was the call for the age of consent for sexual activity to be lowered to fourteen.\n\nStein obtained some notoriety for making progressive statements about brothel laws in New South Wales. In 1989, as a judge of the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales, Stein reportedly said that the New South Wales laws regarding prostitutes and brothels were \"unsatisfactory and confusing\", and the Land and Environment Court was not the forum in which to make moral judgments about prostitution.\n\n\nIn recognition of Stein’s contribution to environmental law and to the community, he was recognised by the award of Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in 1994.\n\nStein is married and has three daughters.\n\n"}

The commission reported in 1978 and made radical recommendations for tort reform, Pearson believing that tort's traditional role of compensation had become outdated with the rise of the welfare state since the end of World War II. He saw the benefits system as having the primary role of providing compensation and security following an accident, and litigation as being secondary. As a result, the commission recommended a no-fault insurance scheme for road traffic and industrial accidents, similar to the subsequent New Zealand Accident Compensation Corporation, and a scheme of strict liability for consumer protection. However, the government's response was cool and the recommendations were not followed up, much to Pearson's disappointment.\n\nThe commission's terms of reference were:\n\nThe commission's members were:\n\nRecovery of damages in tort - no profound changes were recommended but deduction from damages for social security benefits received was recommended and this was subsequently implemented.

The scheme was also proposed to extend to the self-employed and injuries incurred during commuting.\n\nRoad injuries - a no-fault insurance scheme administered by the DHSS, financed by a levy on petrol, estimated at 1p per gallon (0.8p per litre at 2003 prices)\n\nAir transport, Sea and inland waterways - the commission noted that this was largely constrained by international conventions such as the Warsaw Convention but regretted the low level of settlements allowed.\n\nRail transport - a no-fault scheme was rejected in favour of proposed strict liability for accidents arising from movement of rolling stock.\n\nProducts liability - a no-fault scheme was rejected and the strict liability scheme drafted by the Council of Europe and the Commission of the European Union favoured. These European initiatives ultimately led to European Community Directive 85/374/EEC and the Consumer Protection Act 1987.\n\nServices in general - retention of existing remedies for the tort of negligence.\n\nMedical injuries - a no-fault scheme was not recommended but the commission held that the New Zealand and Sweden experience should be studied and reviewed. Strict liability for injury to human volunteers in clinical trials was recommended. No such strict liability was introduced and subsequent volunteers often faced complex litigation as following the disastrous TGN1412 trial in 2006.\n\nChildren - The commission proposed a general benefit for severely disabled children, no matter how their disability was caused, to be financed from general taxation.\n\nVaccine damage - The commission proposed that this would be compensated by the general benefit for severely disabled children. Where vaccination took place on the recommendation of the government, strict liability was proposed.\n\nAnte-natal injury - The commission proposed that this would be compensated by the general benefit for severely disabled children and by strict liability such as it applied to pharmaceuticals. The provisions of the Congenital Disabilities (Civil Liability) Act 1976 should be restricted as it affected family members.\n\nOccupiers' libaility - no change to law on occupiers' liability save the introduction of the Law Commissions recommendations on liability to trespassers which ultimately led to the Occupiers' Liability Act 1984.\n\nCriminal injuries - activities of Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority endorsed and to be reviewed in the light of proposals for civil liability.\n\nAnimals - no change save for aligning Scottish law with that of England and Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nExceptional risks - strict liability on \"controllers of things or operations that by their unusually hazardous nature require supervision because of their potential for causing death or personal injury.\"\n\nThe Labour government expressed some caution over the recommendations, especially those as to no-fault compensation. The Conservative Party and insurance industry were hostile. The Conservative Party came to power in the United Kingdom general election, 1979 and by 1983, the no-fault proposals, though not explicitly rejected, were falling into neglect.\n\n"}
{"id": "46674513", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46674513", "title": "Penguin Books Ltd. v. India Book Distributors and Others", "text": "Penguin Books Ltd. v. India Book Distributors and Others\n\nPenguin Books Ltd. v. India Book Distributors and Others, was a decision of the Delhi High Court issued in 1984. Penguin Books Ltd. of England brought a suit for perpetual injunction against the respondents, India Book Distributors of New Delhi, to restrain them from infringing Penguin's territorial license in 23 books, the subject matter of the suit.\n\nA consent decree had been obtained in the United States stating that there shall be no restriction in regard to a book that is lawfully published for sale, import, export, distribution, or resale. Penguin Books Ltd. (PBL) holds territorial copyright license in some books under the Indian Copyright Act, 1957. The respondents, India Book Distributors, were distributing, importing or offering for sale thirteen of twenty three titles as American editions. A suit for personal injunction was brought against them restraining them from infringing on PBL's territorial license in the subject matter of the suit. The relief of temporary injunction was declined by a single judge on the ground of the US Court’s consent decree.\n\nClauses V and VI of the consent decree provide as follows:\n\n1. Contended that the consent decree is not a bar to asserting rights under the Copyright Act, 1956.\n2. It was contended by the plaintiff that the importation of American Editions for the purpose of resale is an infringement of copyright.\n3. Whether temporary injunction can be granted?\n\nSeveral contentions were raised.\n\n1. Contended that the consent decree is not a bar to asserting rights under the Copyright Act, 1956.\nIt was prima facie evident that PBL had the license to the books in question. The Whitford Committee also observed that there is a practice of challenging the title is more often than not an abuse of process.\nThe court held that the consent decree has no extraterritorial application. The United States of America, being a foreign state, is an independent sovereign government which exercises sovereign authority over its own territory and in accordance with international law has no right to exercise sovereign authority beyond its own territory. The courts of India cannot recognize the writ of a District Court of the United States notwithstanding the principle of comity of nations. This is made abundantly clear from Clause VI which acts as a saving clause. The effect of the clause is that Clause V will not affect the statutory rights that belong to publishers under foreign regional arrangements.\n\nIt was also held by the Court that copyright law is territorial in nature and while US might disallow restrictions on the resale of books, the laws of US may not abrogate the effects of laws in the place where those books have been imported. Thus the importer will be forced to comply with the laws of the country to which he imports and he cannot defeat the rights of the exclusive license holder.\n\n2. It was contended by the plaintiff that the importation of American Editions for the purpose of resale is an infringement of copyright.\n\nImportation:\n\nThe court held that ‘Importation is forbidden unless a license has been given.’ The court said that the above idea needs to be respected as if it is not, then the purpose of granting exclusive licenses would be defeated, as would the idea of the national division of copyright which has been provided for in the International Copyright Convention.\n\nThe argument by the defendant was that importation of lawfully published books is not an infringement of copyright under the Act. The court was dismissed this argument by saying that the owner of copyright has been defined to include an exclusive license. Exclusive license in turn has been defined as a license having ‘any right comprised in the copyright’ in a work to the exclusion of all others including the owner of the copyright. The license may be limited in scope, time and territory.\n\nCopyright has been defined to include the exclusive right, among others, to reproduce the work in any form and to publish the work. Furthermore, S. 51 of the Act deals with infringement. It says that copyright in a work will be infringed when an infringing copy of the work has been imported. Infringing copy of work has been defined as any work which has been imported in contravention to the provisions of the Act. The mainstay of S.51 is that a copyright is deemed to be infringed when any person does something which the Act confers as an exclusive right to the owner of the copyright.\n\nThe court holds in the judgment that the test of whether an imported work infringes copyright is laid down in S.53 (this section allows seizure of goods by the Registrar of Copyrights). The test is that whether the copy if made in India would infringe copyright? If so then it infringes upon copyright. This is because the essence of infringement is taking what is not yours. Copyright is a territorial right and has been regarded as something worth protecting in the ultimate public interest.\n\nThe court held that the import has infringed upon the copyright of PBL because if they are made here they would offend the copyright of PBL.\n\nPublication\n\nThe court also held that the work has been published in India. To do this, the court said that for literary works publication is ‘the issue of copies of the work, either in whole or in part, to the public in a manner sufficient to satisfy the reasonable requirements of the public having regard to the nature of the work.’ \nThe court held that the India Distributors is not guilty of primary infringement but is guilty of secondary infringement when it allows public distribution of titles.\n\n3. Whether temporary injunction can be granted?\n\nThe last question is whether a temporary injunction can be granted. The court said that temporary injunctions are granted in cases where damages are an inadequate remedy. The test for this was laid down in American Cyanamid v. Ethicon. The following questions must be asked:\n\nInjunctions in such cases will usually be granted, as most infringements constitute continuing offences and won’t be granted if the damage to the plaintiff would be out of proportion with the infringement.\n\nThis decision was useful in clarifying the law in India with regard to parallel importation. There was a change in law after the judgment where Section 14 of the Act was amended from \"publication\" to \"issue of copies of the work to the public not being copies already in circulation.\"\n\nIn light of this amendment which when read with S. 40, which says that all provisions of this will apply to works first published in any territory as if it was first published in India, would mean that all books published abroad would be akin to books published in India. So the same limitations should apply, including the doctrine of first sale. This has been the position taken by various commentators. The Court, however, in the recent Eurokids decision seemed not to have taken notice of the change in law and followed the reasoning given in the Penguin judgment.\n\nThe decision has also been criticized as it does not deal with the issue of privity of contract i.e. how are the terms of the license (namely the territorial limitation) being imposed on a third party who has no knowledge of the license and neither is a party to the license?\n\nThe US believes in the doctrine of first sale which enables the resident of the US to resell legally obtained items without the copyright owners permission. In Kirstaeng v. John Wiley & Sons Inc, The US Supreme Court held that the protections and exceptions offered under the copyright act are applicable anywhere and not copies made just in the US. So the first sale doctrine is applicable anywhere and parallel imports are allowed.\n\nEurope follows an idea of regional exhaustion where the first sale doctrine applies within the European Economic Area (EEA). This is because the idea of free trade of goods is placed on a very high pedestal. However, for goods originating outside the EEA, the countries are free to enact law which stops parallel importation using copyright law.\n"}

Ullman, 367 U.S. 497 (1961), was a United States Supreme Court case that held that plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge a Connecticut law that banned the use of contraceptives and banned doctors from advising their use because the law had never been enforced. Therefore, any challenge to the law was deemed unripe because there was no actual threat of injury to anyone who disobeyed the law. The same statute would later be challenged again (successfully) in \"Griswold v.

Harlan described the \"liberty\" protected by that clause as \"a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints.\"\n\nHowever, Justice Harlan specifically noted that laws regulating homosexuality, fornication, and adultery would be permitted under this analysis: \n\nJustice Harlan's general view has had enormous influence on the modern Supreme Court; Justice David Souter endorsed the general reasoning behind Justice Harlan's test in his concurrence in 1997's \"Washington v.

{"id": "6825961", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6825961", "title": "Robert Hubert", "text": "Robert Hubert\n\nBetween 2 and 5 September 1666, a major fire broke out in Pudding Lane in the City of London, and proceeded to destroy around 80 percent of the old city.\n\nHubert's confession, at first, was of starting a fire in Westminster. However, this story proved unsatisfactory, and his confession changed upon learning that the fire never reached Westminster. Having learned that the fire started in Pudding Lane, in the house of the baker Thomas Farriner (or Farynor), he then claimed to have thrown a crude fire grenade through the open window of the Farriner bakery. He claimed to have acted with accomplices, who stopped the water cocks to sabotage the effort to put out the fire. Hubert's confessed motive was, apparently, that he was a French spy, and an agent of the Pope.\n\nHubert's confessions never seemed convincing. His retroactive change of story to fit the facts, though, was not the only reason. Hubert had not even been in London at the time that the fire broke out — he had not even arrived in England until two days after the fire started. That he was not in the country at the time of the outbreak of fire is not in doubt, as testified, years later, by a captain of the Swedish ship the \"Maid of Stockholm\", that he personally had landed Hubert ashore two days after the outbreak of the fire. Having never seen the Farriner bakery, Hubert also did not know that it had no windows. What is more, he was judged so severely crippled that it would have been impossible for him to throw the claimed grenade.\n\nHubert's confession is often attributed to a mental simplicity, an inability to understand what it was he was doing; a kind of \"Confessing Sam\" tendency. One source claims, though, that the confession was coerced \"probably by an extreme form of torture\".\n\nAs \"The London Gazette\" suggests, some put the disaster down to chance:\n\n[...] notwithstanding which suspicion, the manner of the burning all along in a Train, and so blowen forwards in all its way by strong Winds, make us conclude the whole was an effect of an unhappy chance, or to speak better, the heavy hand of God upon us for our sins [...]\n\nDespite the many obvious flaws and impossibilities in Hubert's confession, a scapegoat was needed. Even the king, Charles II, was suspected of having instigated it, in order to punish the people of London for the execution of his father. Nationalism was high with Britain embroiled in the Second Anglo-Dutch War, and many nationalities--the Dutch, French, Spanish, and Irish--were suspect. Frenchmen were particularly vulnerable, as illustrated by the murder of a Frenchman whose tennis balls were mistaken for 'balls of fire'. Hubert, a foreigner and Frenchman, was a chief suspect, as suggested by the \"London Gazette\":\n\n[...] Strangers, Dutch and French were, during the fire, apprehended, upon suspicion that they contributed mischievously to it, who are all imprisoned, and Informations prepared to make a severe inquisition [...]\n\nCatholics were also chief suspects, and accusations were so formal as to be added to the Monument in 1668, which stayed (with brief interruptions) until 1830:\n\n[...] the most dreadful Burning of this City; begun and carried on by the treachery and malice of the Popish faction.\n\nHubert had convenient attributes. He was convicted and sentenced to death at the Old Bailey.\n\nDespite the contradictoriness of both Hubert's account and of public opinion, the Farriner family, in whose bakery the fire had started, was naturally under pressure — they needed to show that their ovens had been doused properly— and three members of the family were present in the jury. Thomas Farynor stated that, after midnight, he had:\n\ngone through every room and found no fire, but in one chimney, where the room was paved with bricks, which fire I diligently raked up in embers [...] no window or door might let wind disturb them and that it was absolutely set on fire on purpose[...]\n\nFew of the jury at his trial actually believed Hubert guilty. One contemporary account claims that Hubert was \"only accused upon his own confession; yet neither the judges nor any present at the trial did believe him guilty, but that he was a poor distracted wretch, weary of his life, and chose to part with it in this way.\" The jury stated that he did not have \"the fear of God before his eyes, but [was] moved and led away by the instigation of the devil\".\n\nHubert was hanged at Tyburn, London, on 27 October 1666. As his body was being handed to the Company of Barber-Surgeons for dissection, it was torn apart by a crowd of Londoners.\n\nIt was hoped that with Hubert's death, \"the talk of plots and conspiracies might die with him\". In 1667, after the need for scapegoats had died down, the fire was officially attributed to 'the hand of God, a great wind and a very dry season...'. One source attributes the accident to a spark falling upon a bale of straw in the bakery of the Farriners, and many assume the spark to have come from the oven of the Farriner's bakery.\n"}
{"id": "1894607", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1894607", "title": "Rules of the road in China", "text": "Rules of the road in China\n\nTraffic law in China is still in its nascent stage (see Road Traffic Safety Law of the People's Republic of China). Therefore, the rules of the road in China are understood to mean both the codified and uncodified practices, procedures and norms of behavior generally followed by motorists, cyclists and pedestrians in the mainland of China.\n\nThe first traffic regulations for China went into effect on August 6, 1955. 59 articles formed the \"City Traffic Regulations\" (), promulgated by the Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China. It was vague and terse, however, and punishments for violators were relatively light.\n\nIn 1988 the regulations were revisited, but the result was still a traffic \"administrative regulation\" (中华人民共和国道路交通管理条例). There still was no \"law\" to control traffic.\n\nThe first expressway traffic regulations surfaced on March 26, 1990, under the title \"Interim Regulations for Expressways\". These were strengthened later on in the 1990s, when a new regulation (albeit temporary) took effect, banning \"new drivers\" (PRC licence holders for less than a year) from the expressways.\n\nThe Road Traffic Safety Law of the People's Republic of China represented a huge breakthrough. It instituted higher fines, compulsory vehicle insurance, and a point system for penalties, among other reforms. The bill was passed with Hu Jintao in power in late October 2003 and took effect on all of mainland China on May 1, 2004.\n\nExcept for a brief period during the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976) when the government encouraged people to drive on the left (for symbolic/ideological reasons), the convention has been to drive on the right. In practice, however, driving to the left into oncoming traffic is not uncommon in China, nor is it as stigmatized and penalized as it is in other countries. This is especially true of bicyclists, electric bicycles, and motorcycles who—unless physically prevented by barriers—are almost equally likely to be found riding on the right, left or straight down the middle of lanes of traffic.\n\nRight-of-way (Simplified Chinese: 先行权, Pinyin: xiānxíngquán, \"Lit: “first go rights\"”) is defined as such in all Chinese dictionaries, however, most Chinese drivers’ understanding of this concept is markedly different from those in societies with a strong tradition of the rule of law. Compared to the western understanding of right-of-way, which refers to the legal right to proceed forward in a vehicle without fear of being found at fault for causing a collision, right-of-way in China means, for all intents and purposes, that the person who is in the way (first) has the right. In practice, this translates into motorists and cyclists turning or merging straight into the path of other traffic believing that the onus is on the other person to avoid a collision. \n\nWhen the right-of-way is unclear (such as at unmarked intersections) it is common practice for drivers in many parts of the world to make eye contact with each other and use nods or hand gestures to either exert or defer right-of-way. The opposite applies in China, where people actively avoid eye contact, and in fact \"turn away\" from the person whose progress they are impeding so as to communicate their intention to proceed regardless. \n\nGiven the relatively recent introduction of a law technically requiring motorists to stop at a red light, it is not surprising that drivers frequently disregard traffic lights and proceed on red. The frequency of this occurrence varies according to time and place. A crowded intersection at midday with police presence results in drivers diligently observing the law, while a desolate intersection at 1 A.M. is sure to witness cars and trucks speeding through red lights without pause.\n\nPedestrians are especially in a difficult situation. In cities such as Beijing, new \"self-service\" traffic lights provide pedestrians with easy access across the road—just push a button, wait, and go when the light changes. Unfortunately, unless these traffic lights come with supervising cameras connected to the police, some drivers are likely to pass through these as well, making the pedestrian buttons rather pointless.\n\nCrossings with no camera of any kind are likely to have chaotic traffic, as neither police nor technology are present to enforce the law.\n\nA substantial change in the new Road Traffic Safety Law of the People's Republic of China is a new requirement which forces drivers to stop at red lights even if there is a crossing only to the left (no crossing to the right), thereby outlawing straight-ahead at red lights that was permitted at an intersection with no crossing to the right. Drivers, however, still can turn right at red lights, unless signs prohibit this.\n\nFinally, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, some battalions of Red Guards would gather at traffic lights, forcing drivers to stop at the green light and go once it had turned red – supposedly because red was the colour of Communism. Due to some traffic light systems being unmanned, drivers at these crossings would often go at the green light – causing collisions where a neighboring lights system was hijacked and all the drivers were going at red. Officially, the idea of \"Red lights mean go\" was never adopted by the regime.\n\nA long-standing tenet has been for the larger vehicle involved in a collision to assume responsibility, e.g., if a car collides with a bicycle the car driver is at fault. If a bicycle and pedestrian collide it is the bicyclist's fault. Practically, this understanding emboldens pedestrians and cyclists to take liberties with cars and trucks, impeding their progress by moving into the flow of traffic under the assumption that larger vehicles will give way. This notwithstanding, the incidence of vehicle-pedestrian collisions is on the decline, despite the fact that the new Road Traffic Safety Law of the People's Republic of China allows for only one case in which drivers are not at fault for hitting a pedestrian—that is, if the pedestrian purposely violates traffic laws.\n\nVery few drivers will slow down when approaching a pedestrian crossing. Even fewer will actually stop for pedestrians waiting to pass by. When this happens, however, a quick wave back by the pedestrian, indicating gratitude, is not uncommon.\n\nRoad rage is uncommon in China. This is possibly due the fact that Chinese motorists have fewer expectations that other drivers will offer to \"give way\" and have a less legalistic/absolute view of traffic procedures. Road rage is not completely absent, however. A few cases have been witnessed in Beijing: they include assault with golf clubs, car chases and the like. Sometimes the police will intervene; those who commit extreme physical assault can often expect to be prosecuted criminally. In compliance with the Chinese criminal code, a case of road rage resulting in death will often see the offender receive the death penalty. A recent example was the Yao Jiaxin murder case.\n\nOfficially, all traffic collisions must be reported to the police. Exempt are cases where only minor damage was done to the vehicle, with nobody hurt, injured or killed. Cases of self-damage (e.g., driving into a tree) officially need to be reported to the police, but in reality, few people bother. This, however, indicates a waiver of responsibility for the insurance company.\n\nWhen a collision occurs between two vehicles it is almost always resolved by the payment of money by one party to the other on the spot, with or without any admission of fault. After initial indignation or recalcitrance, one or both parties will demand financial compensation. It is supposed that either party considers the socio-economic status and occupation of the other, and the desirability of saving face. Eventually one party will relent, and they will bargain down to an agreeable amount of compensation.\n\nAnother feature of a traffic collision in China is that in many cases, neither party will move their vehicle from the position that it came to rest following the collision, regardless of its effect on the flow of traffic. It is a justifiable fear of many Chinese motorists not to move their vehicle from the scene of a collision because recent traffic law changes have provided for hefty penalties in the event of a hit-and-run. A driver found guilty of hit-and-run forfeits his or her license for life, and any party to a collision who flees the scene is subject to severe sanctions.\n\nOften in China, drivers whose cars hit a pedestrian, injuring them, often drive their cars over them several more times to kill them.\n\nA vehicle with a government or military plate are not subject to the \"Road Traffic Safety Law of the People's Republic of China\" (中华人民共和国道路交通安全法); they may run red lights, drive in the wrong direction or weave in and out of traffic. Communist party officials and People's Liberation Army members are also exempt from paying road tolls and adhering to parking regulations. According to Xinhua News Agency, \"police officers are also reluctant to pull over drivers of military vehicles even if the drivers are breaking the law\", which is the reason behind an emerging trend where individuals purchase counterfeit military registration plates to avoid being pulled over by police. Xinhua reported in 2008 that since July 2006, over 4,000 fake military vehicles and 6,300 fake plates have been confiscated, and criminal gangs involving 5,000 people have been apprehended; under Chinese law, those caught driving under fake registration plates are fined up to 2,000 RMB, and counterfeiters can be jailed for up to three years.\n"}

{"id": "36971715", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36971715", "title": "Separation of powers in Singapore", "text": "Separation of powers in Singapore\n\nSeparation of powers in Singapore is founded on the concept of constitutionalism, which is itself primarily based upon distrust of power and thus the desirability of limited government. To achieve this, the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore splits the power to govern the country between three branches of government – the legislature, which makes laws; the executive, which executes them; and the judiciary, which enforces them. Each branch, while wielding legitimate power and being protected from external influences, is subjected to a system of checks and balances by the other branches to prevent abuse of power. This Westminster constitutional model was inherited from the British during Singapore's colonial years.\n\nThe Singapore system of government, as with those of a number of other Commonwealth jurisdictions, exhibits a partial separation of powers. The Cabinet is a parliamentary executive as the Prime Minister and other ministers are drawn from the Members of Parliament (MPs). Hence, it is the Cabinet that drives Parliament's legislative agenda. In addition, the executive possesses some law-making power as it is authorised to issue subsidiary legislation, while the President is a member of both the executive and the legislature.\n\nThe legislature exercises a check upon the executive by imposing a weak sanction through the doctrine of individual ministerial responsibility. Cabinet ministers may be called upon to justify their policies in Parliament by elected MPs (backbenchers belonging to the ruling party and opposition MPs), as well as non-elected Members (Non-constituency members of parliament (NCMPs) and Nominated members of parliament (NMPs)).\n\nIn line with the concept of constitutional supremacy, the judiciary has the role of safeguarding the Constitution, and acts as an institutional check through its inherent power to strike down unconstitutional laws, and to invalidate acts or decisions by the executive which are inconsistent with the Constitution or with administrative law rules. However, judicial power is not unfettered and is also restrained by constitutional and legislative prohibitions. The judiciary also defers to the executive where non-justiciable matters are involved. Judicial independence allows the judiciary to check the exercise of power by the other branches of government more effectively, enhancing the idea of the separation of powers. Constitutional safeguards exist to secure the independence of Supreme Court judges, but a point of contention is that State Courts judges do not enjoy security of tenure as they are members of the Singapore Legal Service and may be transferred out of the State Courts to other departments of the Service by the Legal Service Commission.\n\nThe separation of powers in Singapore is also enhanced by intra-branch checking mechanisms. Within the executive, the Elected President adds to the overall scheme of checks and balances through his discretionary power to block certain government actions. However, the presence of an override mechanism wielded by Parliament blunts the office's powers. The Presidential Council for Minority Rights also serves as a check on the legislature by reviewing bills to ensure that they do not discriminate against racial and religious minorities. However, the Council's powers are constrained by the presence of an override mechanism as well.\n\nThe idea of separation of powers is founded on the basis of constitutionalism. The notion of constitutionalism is primarily one of culture. Lawrence W. Beer proposed in \"Constitutional Systems in the Late Twentieth Century Asia\" (1992) that constitutionalism is where \"national history, custom, religion, social values and assumptions about government meet positive law, economic force and power politics\". As a result, the notion of constitutionalism differs from region to region and there can be no one specific notion of constitutionalism across the world. As Thio Li-ann puts it, \"constitutionalism is itself a form of culture which is constructed, rather than 'organic'; a constitutional order is the 'most complex form of socio-political organisation'\".\n\nEven though the constitutional culture differs from country to country, in general the \"idea of modern constitutionalism rests upon the distrust of power\". This is founded on the problem of power as espoused by Lord Acton – that \"[p]ower tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely\".\n\nIt is this distrust of power that has resulted in the need to ensure separation of powers. The ultimate aim of constitutionalism is to establish the idea of limited government. In countries that subscribe to constitutional supremacy, the constitution is the supreme law of the land and demarcates the extent of power that each branch of government (the executive, legislature and judiciary) is able to wield, as well as how each branch may act as a checking mechanism on the other branches. This aspect of constitutionalism is \"concerned with curbing oppressive government and preserving individual freedom while retaining a realm for the exercise of legitimate governmental power\".\n\nThe state needs laws in order for it to function, and this results in the creation of three distinct powers: one to create laws (the legislature), one to execute the laws (executive), and one to ensure that the rules are being followed (judiciary). Each branch of government has its own set of functions and hence the power that is available for each branch to wield is different as well. Even though this power to govern the society has already been divided into the three branches, the idea of constitutionalism implies \"a commitment towards regularised legal restraints on power in the form of inter- and intra-institutional checks and balances and legal procedure\".\n\nSimply put, there must be a separation of powers, where each branch is able to wield its own power to perform its functions independent of undue influence but yet be restrained from an abuse of its power through checking mechanisms. A system of checks and balances serves to ensure that each power will not be subject to abuse by the controlling body. While the checking mechanisms exercised by each body should be sufficient to prevent abuse of power, they should also not overstep their boundaries and encroach upon the powers that the other branches wield lawfully. In \"The Federalist No. 51\" (6 February 1788), James Madison wrote that \"[a]mbition must be made to counteract ambition\", while in \"The Federalist No. 48\" (1 February 1788) he explained the need for a system of checks and balances in preserving the separation of powers doctrine:\n\nOne of the most notable proponents of the conception of separation of powers was Montesquieu in \"The Spirit of the Laws\" (1748). In that work, he observed:\n\nThe separation of powers brings its merits in just governance. However, where each branch wields more power than it legitimately should, there is room for abuse, leaving the rest of the society open to the potential of being ruled by tyranny of the majority. Hence it is important that a system of checks and balances is in place to ensure that power will not be abused to the detriment of the people.\n\nSeparation of powers also promotes the efficiency and competence in allocating powers by \"[fitting] form to function by matching tasks to the most suitable body\". Specialization of the functions and roles of the various branches helps to promote efficiency as each branch of government has specific tasks and goals that it can work towards. After all, one of the main aims of this measure is to ensure that society's goals are met, and this can be done through an efficient system of government. Lastly, separation of powers helps to enhance democratic responsibility. With the various branches of government being responsible for specific functions, people are more inclined to vote into Parliament (which will form part of the legislature) persons who will best represent their views.\n\nThere are two main notions of separation of powers – pure separation of powers and partial separation of powers. Pure separation of powers was a concept formulated by M. J. C. Vile in \"Constitutionalism and the Separation of Powers\" (1967) as a constitutional arrangement where there are no overlaps at all between the branches of government. In fact, \"the persons who compose these three agencies of government must be kept separate and distinct, no individual being allowed to be at the same time a member of more than one branch. In this way each of the branches will be a check to the others and no single group of people will be able to control the machinery of the State\".\n\nIn practice, this is hard to achieve and largely remains a theoretical notion. One of the few states that can be considered close to achieving this state of separation of powers would be the United States of America. On the other hand, legal systems that follow the Westminster model adopt a partial separation of powers. This occurs when there are overlaps across the three branches. In Singapore, the legislature and executive overlap because ministers in the Cabinet are appointed from the Members of Parliament (MPs). Thus, the same group of people are able to exercise both the power to make law and to execute the law.\n\nThe origins of the separation of powers in Singapore lie in the Westminster constitutional model inherited from the United Kingdom during its colonial past, first as part of the Straits Settlements, and then as an independent nation. When Singapore was transferred to the Colonial Office in 1867, it was given a normal colonial constitution. This constitution vested legislative authority over the colony in the Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements. The constitution also retained the structure of the judicial system already established by the Second Charter of Justice, which had vested judicial power in the Court of Judicature of the Straits Settlements. In 1877, an Executive Council was introduced into the government of the Straits Settlements, with the role of advising the Governor on all affairs of importance.\n\nFrom 1877 onwards, this broad structure specifying the powers of the three organs of state remained largely intact. The constitution remained unchanged until the end of the Japanese Occupation, when the Straits Settlements were disbanded. Although constitutional amendments were then made, the overarching hierarchy of executive, legislative and judicial bodies which had been operating before the war was retained. This basic arrangement also survived Singapore's merger and separation from Malaysia, and consequent independence.\n\nThe Singapore Constitution thus vests legislative, executive and judicial power in the legislature, executive and judiciary respectively. This is a defining feature of Westminster-style constitutions, of which Singapore's constitution is one. The doctrine is implicit from the fact that the organs of state have separate roles.\n\nThe separation of powers doctrine in Singapore is not absolute but qualified; it is not pure but partial. The partial separation of powers doctrine in Singapore is exemplified in the following ways:\n\n\nThe English influence on Singapore's governmental system is visibly strong, though Singapore's system fundamentally differs from that of the United Kingdom as it is unicameral. Singapore's take on the separation of powers is greatly informed by its unique values and legal culture. The traditional separation of powers doctrine in the United Kingdom is based on a fundamental distrust of human nature, and by extension, an even greater distrust of power, which \"tends to corrupt\". As a result, it is necessary for each branch of government to be checked and managed, to prevent its otherwise absolute and uncurtailed power being abused. Singapore, on the other hand, has based its system of government on the election of trustworthy and honourable leaders, instead of on the implementation of a system specifically to prevent dishonourable ones misusing their power. In other words, aside from legal methods of controlling government – that is, through institutionalised checks and balances – non-legal methods are used as well, \"internally from Parliament and the Executive itself in upholding high standards of public administration and policy\".\n\nThis attitude towards the control of public power reflects the Confucian ideals underlying the Government's stance that separation of powers is less important than choosing leaders that can be trusted and do not need to be fettered:\n\nSince independence, Singapore's legal system has evolved increasingly towards its local context. Developments in government and constitutionalism have brought about distinctive features in its system of checks and balances. A few issues arise due to the long-standing one-party dominance in Singapore's political system. Since the 1963 general election, the People's Action Party has repeatedly prevailed as the majority party in Parliament. In the recent 2011 general election, it managed to capture 81 of 87 seats contested.\n\nAs mentioned above, Singapore has a parliamentary executive in which Cabinet ministers are drawn from and accountable to Parliament. The existence of a parliamentary executive does not mean government by Parliament; it is a separate and distinct branch of power, suited to make policies and carry out executive decisions.\n\nHowever, because of the party system, the Cabinet is often composed of the leaders of the majority party in Parliament. As such, it asserts control over the legislative agenda. One associated problem is that of an \"elective dictatorship\" – Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone, once described it as the dominance of the executive over a subservient Parliament.\n\nThe doctrine of individual ministerial responsibility is a constitutional convention adopted from the Westminster constitutional model. According to this doctrine, Parliament imposes a check on the Cabinet by scrutinising government bills and actions, and calling upon ministers to justify policies before the House in open debate. This ensures that the Cabinet is accountable not only to Parliament but also to the public, who have access to transcripts of Parliamentary debates.\n\nConsistent with the party system, the Government also observes collective ministerial responsibility or Cabinet collective responsibility. This is enshrined in Article 24(2) of the Constitution, which states that \"[s]ubject to the provisions of this Constitution, the Cabinet shall have the general direction and control of the Government and shall be collectively responsible to Parliament\". According to Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong in 2002, \"[t]he principle of collective responsibility means that there is an agreement between the Prime Minister and his Cabinet colleagues that they will stand together as a team when accounting for their actions before Parliament\". This principle also seeks to enhance inter-ministry co-ordination by ensuring that all ministers share the same broad policy positions, and that there is no \"unnecessary duplication or, worse, mutual contradiction\".\n\nThis check on the executive branch, however, is a weak one. Since Cabinet ministers are often the leaders of the majority party in Parliament, they may enforce party discipline and loyalty through the party whip such that MPs from that party conform to the party line. This means that a majority of Parliament will be less inclined, if at all, to oppose or challenge the executive's decisions.\n\nGiven the one-party dominance in Singapore, the opposition MPs in Parliament play a crucial role in checking the executive. They enforce the doctrine of ministerial responsibility by providing constructive criticism of executive policies. They are also entitled to vote for or against bills and motions, but this may exercise little influence over majoritarian power. As such, the effectiveness of the opposition hinges on its ability to keep the executive, as well as the majority party, vigilant and accountable to society.\n\nNon-Constituency members of parliament (NCMPs) were introduced into Parliament for the purpose of ensuring \"the representation in Parliament of a minimum number of Members from a political party or parties not forming the Government\". The number of NCMPs in Parliament is nine less the number of opposition MPs elected at a general election.\n\nMarking a departure from the Westminster model, the NCMP scheme was conceived to introduce alternative political voices in Parliament. According to Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng, the presence of a parliamentary minority would help younger MPs gain experience in debate, ensure transparency of Parliamentary proceedings and \"dispel any suspicions of cover-ups\", as well as give the opposition a forum to put forth their agenda. NCMPs enjoy the same privileges and immunities as elected Members, but they cannot vote on a bill to amend the Constitution; a supply, supplementary or final supply bill; a money bill, a vote of no confidence in the Government or a motion for the removal of the President from office.\n\nSome commentators have remarked that the NCMP scheme is premised on the assumption that the one party-dominance will continue to govern Singapore's political state of affairs. Nonetheless, the scheme gives the opposition parties a platform to share their political ideas, as well as augment opposition strength in Parliament as a check on the executive.\n\nNominated members of parliament (NMPs) are another departure from the Westminster model. Unlike NCMPs, NMPs are intended to be apolitical voices in Parliament – the purpose of the NCMP scheme is to have MPs hailing from various fields and professions who can \"reflect as wide a range of independent and non-partisan views as possible\".\n\nThough NMPs may in effect be insignificant as a check on the executive, they can present alternative viewpoints which the Government may consider and even choose to respond to, particularly where they concern socially significant issues. As NMP Paulin Tay Straughan has said: \"The day when we move into a two-party system where opposing voices are more visible, we will not need NMPs or NCMPs anymore. But until we get there, the NMPs have a role to play.\"\n\nIn \"Law Society of Singapore v. Tan Guat Neo Phyllis\" (2008), the High Court described the guardianship role of the judiciary in safeguarding the Constitution and the doctrine of separation of powers, holding that to prevent each arm of government from acting beyond its constitutional powers, \"[u]nder the Constitution, the means adopted and recognised by all three arms of government is the judicial power of the court to review the legality of legislative and executive acts and declare them unconstitutional and of no legal effect if they contravene the provisions of the Constitution\".\n\nJudicial independence from the other branches of government allows the judiciary to act as a check and balance on the exercise of legislative and executive power, and thus enhances the separation of powers. The extent of judicial independence in Singapore can be examined by reference to the way judges are appointed, and, in particular, the independence of the judiciary of the State Courts. These two aspects relate specifically to the protection of the judiciary as an institution from extraneous influences, rather than the protection of individual members of the judiciary from external pressures.\n\nAppointments of judges and Judicial Commissioners (JCs) of the Supreme Court are made by the President, when, in his discretion, he concurs with the Prime Minister's advice on the matter. The Prime Minister thus possesses the primary power of appointment of judges of the Supreme Court. Although the Prime Minister must consult the Chief Justice when advising the President to appoint judges and JCs, and the President is empowered to veto judicial appointments, these are relatively small roles played in the final say as to who should be appointed to the judiciary. Thus, it is said that the judiciary may not be an effective check against the abuse of executive power since the executive is likely to appoint judges who believe in the same fundamental policies. This militates against the separation of powers. On the other hand, in a small jurisdiction like Singapore, the executive and judicial roles are inevitably intertwined as there will be very few potential appointees to the Supreme Court who have never been involved with the executive government.\n\nThe Constitution contains several safeguards to protect the judiciary from political pressures. For instance, Supreme Court judges hold office until the age of 65, and may not be removed from office except under special circumstances. The President may, on the recommendation of a tribunal of five present or former Supreme Court judges from Singapore or judges of equivalent status from any part of the Commonwealth, remove a judge from office, if the Prime Minister or the Chief Justice acting on the Prime Minister's advice informs him of the judge's misbehaviour or inability to properly discharge the functions of his or her office. Supreme Court judges are also constitutionally guaranteed protection from adverse remunerative changes.\n\nIt has been argued that the power of the executive to appoint JCs for limited periods or to hear a specific case, and to extend the tenure of Supreme Court judges beyond the age of 65 by hiring them on a term basis, may motivate such judges to render decisions that are in line with government policy. As regards the latter, a mechanism for the extension of a judge's tenure might be regarded as necessary to ensure that better judges are not replaced by less capable ones.\n\nIn Singapore, the lower or subordinate judiciary consists of the District Judges and Magistrates of the State Courts. These judges are members of the Legal Service, which is governed by the Legal Service Commission (\"LSC\"). The President appoints State Courts judges from among the members of the Legal Service on the recommendation of the Chief Justice, who is also the chairman of the LSC.\n\nThe LSC is composed of members who enjoy differing degrees of independence from the executive branch. These include the Chief Justice, the Attorney-General and a superior judge appointed by the Chief Justice who are highly independent from executive influence. On the other hand, the remaining persons who are the chairman and two other members of the Public Service Commission enjoy less security of office as they enjoy a tenure of only five years.\n\nThe subordinate judiciary in Singapore has come under more scrutiny than the superior judiciary. State Courts judges lack tenure, and the LSC determines the terms of their appointments. Thus, the substance of the criticisms is that the career advancement of the lower judiciary depends on the LSC, of which the Attorney-General is a member. Members of the subordinate judiciary can be transferred out of the courts to the Attorney-General's Chambers or to some other government department to serve as legal officers. Thus, there are worries of heavy legislative and executive influence over the appointment and removal of subordinate judges, and that they will be influenced by government ideology and policy in their role as judges.\n\nThe case of Senior District Judge Michael Khoo being appointed as a deputy public prosecutor in August 1981 is often cited in this context. The appointment occurred shortly after Khoo had acquitted J. B. Jeyaretnam, a prominent opposition MP, of certain charges of having fraudulently transferred cheques to prevent the distribution of money to the creditors of the Workers' Party of Singapore, and of making a false declaration. The reason for the transfer was never conclusively established; while it could have been motivated by executive disapproval of the acquittals, it may well have been a routine transfer with no implications for executive interference in the subordinate judiciary. The latter was the official explanation for the transfer.\n\nHowever, it has also been said that observations about the apparent connections between the executive and judiciary are merely theoretical, and that for a more accurate analysis of the separation of powers in Singapore the \"[j]udiciary must be judged on its performance in the context of actual litigation\". Furthermore, assertions that the subordinate judiciary is not separate from the executive since the LSC is allied to the government disregard the fact that the Chief Justice is the head of the LSC and has the final say on judicial postings. Moreover, in a small state, it may not be feasible to have a separate judicial and legal service.\n\nIn \"Mohammad Faizal bin Sabtu v. Public Prosecutor\" (2012), the High Court explained that the doctrine of separation of powers \"entails, in so far as the judicial branch is concerned, that the legislative and the executive branches of the State may not interfere with the exercise of the judicial power by the judicial branch. This total separation between the exercise of the judicial power on the one hand and the exercise of the legislative and the executive powers on the other hand is based on the rule of law.\"\nIn Singapore, the Supreme Court upholds the separation of powers and constitutional supremacy by exercising jurisdiction to judicially review the constitutionality of legislation, thereby acting as a check upon the legislature. The High Court in \"Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. Public Prosecutor\" (1994) held that the court has \"the power and duty to ensure that the provisions of the Constitution are observed. The court also has a duty to declare invalid any exercise of power, legislative and executive, which exceeds the limits of the power conferred by the Constitution, or which contravenes any prohibition which the Constitution provides.\" The Supreme Court also exercises supervisory jurisdiction over inferior tribunals and public authorities, and can hold that acts and decisions by them which infringe administrative law rules are invalid.\n\nWhile the judiciary is empowered to declare ordinary legislation unconstitutional, the legislature is able to overrule such decisions by amending the Constitution. For example, in \"Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs\" (1988), the Court of Appeal adopted an objective test for reviewing ministerial discretion in the issuance of preventive detention orders under the Internal Security Act (\"ISA\"). However, within a month of the decision, Parliament amended the Constitution and the Internal Security Act to reinstate the subjective test espoused in \"Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs\" (1971).\n\nThis form of legislative over-ruling, if done frequently, has two major detrimental effects. First, if the legislature or executive is seen as being able to manipulate the constitutional limits on their powers, this greatly impairs judicial independence. Secondly, it may thwart the perception that the judiciary is a co-equal institution in the scheme of the separation of powers, thus causing a loss of respect and public confidence in the system. Speaking in Parliament during the Second Reading of the bill amending the Constitution to reverse the effect of \"Chng Suan Tze\", the Minister for Law S. Jayakumar quoted Lord Diplock to justify this truncation of judicial review on the basis that national security is \"the responsibility of the executive government\", and it is a non-justiciable question which \"the judicial process is totally inept to deal with\". He stated that the executive would be accountable to both Parliament and the people for its exercise of discretionary powers.\n\nFurther, the political branches of government may seek to limit judicial review through the use of ouster clauses. Examples of such clauses include Article 18(9) of the Constitution, section 8B(2) of the ISA, and section 18 of the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act. However, it remains an open question whether ouster clauses are fully effective or whether, as the House of Lords held in \"Anisminic Ltd. v. Foreign Compensation Commission\" (1968), they do not apply to the acts and decisions of public authorities that are a nullity. Speaking extrajudicially, Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong suggested that any statutory clause attempting to oust the supervisory jurisdiction of the courts may contravene Article 93, which vests the judicial power of Singapore in the courts.\n\nThe courts have developed an internal doctrine of self-imposed judicial restraint by which they will either decline to review what they consider a non-justiciable issue, calibrate review to a low intensity, or exercise review on limited grounds.\n\nIn matters pertaining to \"high policy\" such as treaty-making, national defence and foreign relations, the courts will generally decline judicial review of the exercise of power in deference to the executive. This doctrine stems from the idea that there are cases dealing with subject matters which fall beyond the purview of judicial review. The court's decision to intervene or not is guided by the following four principles enunciated by Judicial Commissioner Sundaresh Menon in \"Lee Hsien Loong v. Review Publishing Co Ltd\" (2007):\n\n\nHowever, areas of high policy such as national security do not automatically apply as a \"plea in bar\". On scrutiny of such cases which are \"prima facie\" non-justiciable, the courts may be able to glean a question of law that is justiciable.\n\nWhile Article 93 of the Constitution vests judicial power in the courts, Article 35(8) provides that \"[t]he Attorney-General shall have power, exercisable at his discretion, to institute, conduct or discontinue any proceedings for any offence\". In \"Tan Guat Neo Phyllis\", the High Court stated that these two provisions expressly separate the prosecutorial function from the judicial function, and that they are coequal. As such, the two functions are not to encroach upon each other, although the court may interfere where prosecutorial power has been exercised in bad faith or unconstitutionally.\n\nThe office of the Elected President of Singapore represents an indigenisation of the Westminster system of government and is cast as a check against the powers enjoyed by the parliamentary executive, adding to the overall scheme of checks and balances in the doctrine of separation of powers. Nonetheless, the institution has a limited range of functions and is essentially reactive in nature, such that it cannot be seen to be an alternative locus of political power. The President has power to block attempts by the Government to draw down past reserves it did not accumulate, to approve changes to key appointments, and to exercise oversight over the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau and decisions of the executive under the ISA and the MRHA. The aim is not to enable the President to target unlawful executive actions, but lawful actions against national interests.\n\nThe impetus behind the introduction of the scheme was the Government's perception that there were \"inadequate checks in our present parliamentary system of government\" as a political party with a parliamentary majority, even of one seat, \"can do practically anything it wishes, provided it acts lawfully\" in matters pertaining to financial assets and key appointments. It was also thought that it would be prudent to institute a check \"while honest men are still in charge\". While the objective of protecting against fiscal mismanagement was agreed on, the method of doing so was disputed, with opposition politicians arguing that the parliamentary system would have sufficient checks if opposition parties were allowed to operate more freely and to flourish.\n\nTo be an effective check, the President must be sufficiently independent and adequately empowered to change or at least block harmful or unsound government policies. Various constitutional provisions seek to achieve this. The President cannot hold any other constitutional office; if a person was an MP prior to being elected as President, the parliamentary seat is to be vacated. To stand as a candidate in a presidential election, a candidate is also required to resign his or her membership in any political party, reflecting the depoliticisation of the elective office. To ensure that the President's watchdog function is unhampered by executive intimidation, the office is maintained out of the which cannot be diminished during the President's term. The President is also immune from civil suits for acts done in his official capacity.\n\nThe President has discretionary power to veto certain executive decisions pertaining primarily to three areas: fiscal management, ensuring meritocracy in a corruption-free civil service, and guardianship over civil liberties where judicial review has been ousted. For the purpose of carrying out his functions, the President is entitled to access to Cabinet papers and may request information concerning the reserves of the Government, or of any statutory board or government company listed in the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution. The relevant minister, or officer of the statutory board or government company, is under a duty to provide such information.\n\nThe President, however, does not have the final say over certain decisions, as Parliament may override his veto with a resolution supported by not less than two-thirds of all the elected MPs. For instance, this mechanism applies if the President vetoes key civil service appointments or withholds assent to bills that are likely to draw on the nation's past reserves. A prerequisite for the exercise of the override mechanism is that the President must have disagreed with the recommendation of the Council of Presidential Advisers, which he is required consult before exercising these powers. The override mechanism shows that the President's discretionary powers pose no obstacle to a government which continues to enjoy untrammelled power so long as it controls a clear two-thirds parliamentary majority. The weaker the Government is, the stronger the presidential check is; and the stronger the Government, the weaker the presidential blocking mechanism.\n\nSingapore has a unicameral legislature, meaning that there is no division of legislative authority between an upper and a lower house. Nevertheless, the Presidential Council for Minority Rights (\"PCMR\") can be seen as a quasi-second chamber as it plays a role in legislative review, highlighting bills containing measures that discriminate against racial and religious minorities. Thus, it plays a role in the separation of powers by acting as a check upon the executive and legislature.\n\nHowever, Parliament can easily circumvent an adverse report on a bill by the PCMR as it can continue to present the bill to the President for assent if not less than two-thirds of all the elected MPs endorse a motion in favour of such action. The PCMR's powers of legislative review are further attenuated because the Constitution designates certain types of bills as falling outside the ambit of its scrutiny, namely, money bills, bills certified by the Prime Minister as affecting \"the defence or the security of Singapore\" or relating to \"public safety, peace or good order in Singapore\", and urgent bills. Thus the PCMR has been said to be a weak institution that lacks coercive power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "775021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=775021", "title": "Service-level agreement", "text": "Service-level agreement\n\nA service-level agreement (SLA) is a commitment between a service provider and a client. Particular aspects of the service – quality, availability, responsibilities – are agreed between the service provider and the service user. The most common component of SLA is that the services should be provided to the customer as agreed upon in the contract. As an example, Internet service providers and telcos will commonly include service level agreements within the terms of their contracts with customers to define the level(s) of service being sold in plain language terms. In this case the SLA will typically have a technical definition in \"mean time between failures\" (MTBF), \"mean time to repair\" or \"mean time to recovery\" (MTTR); identifying which party is responsible for reporting faults or paying fees; responsibility for various data rates; throughput; jitter; or similar measurable details.\n\nA service-level agreement is an agreement between two or more parties, where one is the customer and the others are service providers. This can be a legally binding formal or an informal \"contract\" (for example, internal department relationships). The agreement may involve separate organizations, or different teams within one organization. Contracts between the service provider and other third parties are often (incorrectly) called SLAs – because the level of service has been set by the (principal) customer, there can be no \"agreement\" between third parties; these agreements are simply \"contracts.\" Operational-level agreements or OLAs, however, may be used by internal groups to support SLAs. If some aspect of a service has not been agreed with the customer, it is not an \"SLA\".\n\nSLAs commonly include many components, from a definition of services to the termination of agreement. To ensure that SLAs are consistently met, these agreements are often designed with specific lines of demarcation and the parties involved are required to meet regularly to create an open forum for communication. Rewards and penalties applying to the provider are often specified. Most SLAs also leave room for periodic (annual) revisitation to make changes.\n\nSince late 1980s SLA's have been used by fixed line telecom operators. SLAs are so widely used these days that larger organizations have many different SLAs existing within the company itself. Two different units in an organization script a SLA with one unit being the customer and another being the service provider. This practice helps to maintain the same quality of service amongst different units in the organization and also across multiple locations of the organization. This internal scripting of SLA also helps to compare the quality of service between an in-house department and an external service provider.\n\nThe output received by the customer as a result of the service provided is the main focus of the service level agreement.\n\nService level agreements are also defined at different levels:\n\nA well defined and typical SLA will contain the following components:\n\nService-level agreements can contain numerous service-performance metrics with corresponding service-level objectives. A common case in IT-service management is a call center or service desk. Metrics commonly agreed to in these cases include:\n\nUptime is also a common metric, often used for data services such as shared hosting, virtual private servers and dedicated servers. Common agreements include percentage of network uptime, power uptime, number of scheduled maintenance windows, etc.\n\nMany SLAs track to the Information Technology Infrastructure Library specifications when applied to IT services.\n\nIt is not uncommon for an internet backbone service provider (or network service provider) to explicitly state its own SLA on its website. The U.S. Telecommunications Act of 1996 does not expressly mandate that companies have SLAs, but it does provide a framework for firms to do so in Sections 251 and 252. Section 252(c)(1) for example (\"Duty to Negotiate\") requires Incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) to negotiate in good faith about matters such as resale and access to rights of way.\n\nA web service level agreement (WSLA) is a standard for service level agreement compliance monitoring of web services. It allows authors to specify the performance metrics associated with a web service application, desired performance targets, and actions that should be performed when performance is not met.\n\nWSLA Language Specification, version 1.0 was published by IBM on January 28, 2001.\n\nThe underlying benefit of cloud computing is shared resources, which is supported by the underlying nature of a shared infrastructure environment. Thus, SLAs span across the cloud and are offered by service providers as a service-based agreement rather than a customer-based agreement. Measuring, monitoring and reporting on cloud performance is based on the end UX or their ability to consume resources. The downside of cloud computing relative to SLAs is the difficulty in determining the root cause of service interruptions due to the complex nature of the environment.\n\nAs applications are moved from dedicated hardware into the cloud, they need to achieve the same or even more demanding levels of service than classical installations. SLAs for cloud services focus on characteristics of the data center and more recently include characteristics of the network (see carrier cloud) to support end-to-end SLAs.\n\nAny SLA management strategy considers two well-differentiated phases: negotiating the contract and monitoring its fulfilment in real time. Thus, SLA management encompasses the SLA contract definition: the basic schema with the QoS parameters; SLA negotiation; SLA monitoring; SLA violation detection; and SLA enforcement—according to defined policies.\n\nThe main point is to build a new layer upon the grid, cloud, or SOA middleware able to create a negotiation mechanism between the providers and consumers of services. An example is the EU–funded Framework 7 research project, SLA@SOI, which is researching aspects of multi-level, multi-provider SLAs within service-oriented infrastructure and cloud computing, while another EU-funded project, VISION Cloud, has provided results with respect to content-oriented SLAs.\n\nFP7 IRMOS also investigated aspects of translating application-level SLA terms to resource-based attributes in an effort to bridge the gap between client-side expectations and cloud-provider resource-management mechanisms. A summary of the results of various research projects in the area of SLAs (ranging from specifications to monitoring, management and enforcement) has been provided by the European Commission.\n\nOutsourcing involves the transfer of responsibility from an organization to a supplier. This new arrangement is managed through a contract that may include one or more SLAs. The contract may involve financial penalties and the right to terminate if any of the SLAs metrics are consistently missed. Setting, tracking and managing SLAs is an important part of the outsourcing relationship management (ORM) discipline. Specific SLAs are typically negotiated up front as part of the outsourcing contract and used as one of the primary tools of outsourcing governance.\n\nIn software development, specific SLAs can apply to application outsourcing contracts in line with standards in software quality, as well as recommendations provided by neutral organizations like CISQ, which has published numerous papers on the topic (such as \"Using Software Measurement in SLAs\") that are available to the public.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4250178", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4250178", "title": "South African constitutional reform referendum, 1983", "text": "South African constitutional reform referendum, 1983\n\nA referendum on a new constitution was held in South Africa on 2 November 1983 in which the white population was given the opportunity to approve or reject the Constitution of 1983. This constitution introduced the Tricameral Parliament, in which coloured and Indian South Africans would be represented in separate parliamentary chambers, while black South Africans would remain unrepresented. The referendum passed with 66.3% of voters voting \"Yes\"; consequently the new constitution came into force on 3 September 1984.\n\nIn 1981 the Senate was abolished and replaced with the President's Council, which was an advisory body consisting of sixty nominated members from the white, coloured, Indian and Chinese population groups. Following a request by Prime Minister P.W. Botha, the President's Council presented a set of proposals in 1982 for constitutional and political reform. This proposal called for the implementation of \"power sharing\" between the white, coloured and Indian communities.\n\nThe right wing of the ruling National Party (NP) rejected this proposal and a group of its MPs, led by Dr. Andries Treurnicht, a cabinet minister and the leader of the NP in the Transvaal province, broke away to form the Conservative Party (CP) in order to fight for a return to apartheid in its original form. However, Botha continued to be in favour of implementing the President's Council proposal and in 1983 the NP government introduced a new constitutional framework. A referendum was called for in order to determine public support for the reforms amongst white voters. The New Republic Party led by Vause Raw supported the new constitution, although it continued to call for black representation in Parliament.\n\nBoth the Progressive Federal Party (PFP), which objected to the exclusion of blacks, as well as the CP, which objected to the participation of coloureds and Indians, campaigned for a \"No\" vote. However, many PFP followers and parts of the anti-government English language press supported the new constitution as \"a step in the right direction\". The conservative opposition to the reforms used banners with the text \"Rhodesia voted yes – vote no!\" reflecting on the transformation to majority rule in Rhodesia.\n\nThe response of Coloured, Indian and black leaders were mixed. The new constitution was rejected by most Bantustan leaders and the Urban Councils Association of South Africa (representing the black township administrations) because it did not provide for black representation. Coloured and Indian parties that intended to participate in the Tricameral Parliament but also insisted on extending representation to the black majority. \n\nThe United Democratic Front (UDF) was launched as a non-racial coalition to oppose the referendum and the subsequent elections for the coloured and Indian chambers in parliament.\n\nFor counting purposes the provinces of South Africa were divided into various referendum areas. The following table shows the results in each area.\n"}

Jaslow\" in 1986.\nThe method of comparing the SSO of two software products has since evolved in attempts to avoid the extremes of over-protection and under-protection, both of which are considered to discourage innovation. \nMore recently, the concept has been used in \"Oracle America, Inc. v. Google, Inc.\"\n\n\"Whelan Assocs., Inc. v. Jaslow Dental Laboratory, Inc.\" was a landmark case in defining principles that applied to copyright of computer software.\nWhelan had developed software for Jaslow to manage the operations of a dental laboratory, and later took it to market under the trade name \"Dentalab\". \nJaslow became engaged in selling the \"Dentalab\" software.\nHe later formed a new company named Dentcom and wrote a program in a different computer language but with similar functionality that he called \"Dentlab\", marketing it as a \"Dentalab\" successor. Whelan filed a suit in federal court in Pennsylvania alleging that the \"Dentlab\" software violated Whelan's copyrights in the \"Dentalab\" software.\nWhelan won the case and was awarded damages on the basis that \"Dentlab\" had substantially similar structure and overall organization.\n\nThe district court ruling in \"Whelan\" drew on the established doctrine that even when the component parts of a work cannot be copyrightable, the structure and organization of a work may be.\nThe court also drew support from the 1985 \"SAS Inst. Inc. v. S&H Computer Sys. Inc.\" in which it had been found that copyright protected organizational and structural details, not just specific lines of source or object code.\nSequence, structure and organization (SSO) in this case was defined as \"the manner in which the program operates, controls and regulates the computer in receiving, assembling, calculating, retaining, correlating, and producing useful information.\"\nSSO refers to non-literal elements of computer programs that include \"data input formats, file structures, design, organization and flow of the code, screen outputs or user interfaces, and the flow and sequencing of the screens.\". However, the SAS Inst. Inc. V. S&H Computer Sys. Inc. demonstrated that copyright can exist in derived works from publicly funded developed source code in the public domain rather than address the issue of SSO.\n\nJaslow appealed the decision.\nThe Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit noted that computer programs are literary works under U.S. law.\nThe court reasoned that with literary works a non-literal element is protected to the extent that it is an expression of an idea rather than the idea itself. By analogy, the purpose or function of a software work would be the work's \"idea\", while everything not necessary to that purpose or function would be part of the expression of the idea. The expression would be protected, although the basic purpose or function would not.\nOn this basis the Court of Appeals upheld the district court's ruling of copyright violation due to similarity of SSO.\n\nFor the next few years most, but not all, circuit courts accepted the \"Whelan\" decision on SSO in one form or another. This resulted in a period of tight protection for software, since almost everything other than the broad purpose of a software work would be protected. The only exception was where the functionality could only be achieved in a very small number of ways. In these cases there could be no protection due to the merger doctrine, which applies when the expression and the idea are inextricably merged.\n\nIn one case a court found that a defendant had infringed the right to prepare a derivative work when they copied the sequence, structure, and organization of the plaintiff's file formats, screen, reports, and transaction codes, even though different data fields were present.\nIn 1986 the ruling in \"Broderbund Software, Inc v. Unison World, Inc\" appeared to prevent software developers from marketing products with the same or similar user interfaces, regardless of whether there was anything in common in the underlying code.\nIn the 1990 case of \"Lotus v. Paperback\" the U.S. District Court for Massachusetts decided that Paperback's VP-Planner software violated the copyright of Lotus's 1-2-3 spreadsheet program since it had the same user interface, even though the underlying code was completely different.\n\nA technical criticism of \"Whelan\" is that it fails to distinguish between the sequence in which instructions are presented in the text of a program and the sequence in which the instructions are executed - the program's behavior. Both the textual and behavioral aspects have their own SSO, but a programmer would see the textual SSO as relatively unimportant.\nA related point is that although the text of a computer program may be an \"original work of authorship\", protected by copyright laws. The algorithms and designs that the program embodies may be better considered to be \"processes, procedures, systems, methods of operation\", which are explicitly excluded from copyright protection although they may be protectable by patents.\nThe distinction between the code's SSO, which is protected by copyright, and the protocol or algorithm, which is patentable, is however extremely difficult to maintain.\n\nThe \"Whelan\" ruling has been criticized as being \"dangerously broad\". \nBy saying that the purpose of the program was to assist a Dental lab operation, and that anything not essential to that purpose was an expression, \nit left open a wide range of functions that could be deemed \"not essential\" and therefore subject to protection.\nIn the 1988 \"Healthcare Affiliated Services, Inc. v. Lippany\" the court took a position more in line with the idea-expression merger concept, saying that the defendant's choice of scope, variables to be used and other aspects of what its software would do did not constitute the SSO.\nIn 1987 the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rejected the extension of copyright protection to the non-literal elements of computer programs in \nthe case of \"Plains Cotton Cooperative Ass'n v. Goodpasture Computer Serv\".\nThe court held that input formats were idea rather than expression and refused to extend protection to these formats. \nThe court said: \"We decline to embrace \"Whelan\".\"\n\nIn \"Computer Associates Int. Inc. v. Altai Inc.\" in 1992 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the conclusion in \"Whelan\" that the structure, sequence and organization of a program might by protected by copyright where appropriate.\nHowever, the court went on to say, \"As we have already noted, a computer program's ultimate function or purpose is the composite result of interacting subroutines. Since each Subroutine is itself a program, and thus, may be said to have its own 'idea,' Whelan's general formulation that a program's overall Purpose equates with the program's idea is descriptively inadequate.\"\n\nThe Second Circuit introduced the three-step Abstraction-Filtration-Comparison test, and several other circuits later adopted this test. In the abstraction step the court identifies similarities starting from the object and source code and moving up to higher levels of abstraction. In the filtration step any legitimate similarities are discarded. \nElements removed in this step include obvious expressive interpretations of broad ideas, elements dictated by efficiency or external considerations, elements in the public domain and industry standards.\nIn the comparison step the court decides whether there is enough similarity between the remaining elements to constitute infringement, and if so the severity of the infringement.\n\nOne effect of the \"Altai\" case may have been that companies that thought they were protected under \"Whelan\", and had therefore not filed patent applications, now found themselves exposed.\nThe \"Altai\" case may have gone too far, in effect removing protection from all but the literal elements of a program and thus leading to underprotection. \nAware of this risk, many courts that followed the \"Altai\" ruling seem to have in practice performed less filtration than was required by the test.\nHowever, most circuits have accepted \"Altai\" in preference to \"Whelan\".\n\nBoth the code and the \"look and feel\" of a software product have structure, sequence and organization. \nTechnically there is little or no connection between the two.\nThe same look and feel can be created by entirely different software products, and two internally very similar software products may present very different look and feel.\nHowever, the courts have tried to maintain common standards and tests for both types of SSO.\n\nFollowing the 1986 \"Broderbund\" ruling, Lotus Development Corporation sued two competing spreadsheet program vendors for copying the look and feel of their Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet program, and Apple Computers sued Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard for copying the Macintosh operating system's use of icons, pull-down menus and a mouse pointing device. Both companies drew criticism, since key elements of their look and feel had been introduced earlier by VisiCalc and Xerox.\nA 1992 federal court finding against Apple largely rejected the idea that copyright law could protect look and feel.\nThe Lotus case went to the Supreme Court, which could not reach a decision, thus by default confirming the lower court's 1995 declaration that the words and commands used to manipulate the spreadsheet were a \"method of operation\", which is not subject to copyright.\n\nOnly patent law can protect the behavior of a computer program.\nCompetitors may create programs that provide essentially the same functionality as a protected program as long as they do not copy the code.\nThe trend has been for courts to say that even if there are non-literal SSO similarities, there must be proof of copying. \nSome relevant court decisions allow for reverse-engineering to discover ideas that are not subject to copyright within a protected program.\nThe ideas can be implemented in a competing program as long as the developers do not copy the original expression.\nWith a clean room design approach one team of engineers derives a functional specification from the original code, \nand then a second team uses that specification to design and build the new code.\nThis was piloted in the mid-1980s by a team from Phoenix Technologies to produce a BIOS functionally equivalent to that of the IBM Personal Computer without infringing on IBM's copyright.\n\nIn August 2010 Oracle Corporation initiated a lawsuit against Google claiming a combination of patent and copyright violations related to Google's implementation of the Java programming language in Google's Android operating system.\nOn May 7, 2012 a jury decided that Google had infringed the SSO copyright of 37 Java Application programming interface (API) packages, but were unable to decide whether this was fair use.\nThe judge asked both Google and Oracle to provide further detail of their positions over whether an API or a programming language such as Java can be copyrighted.\nHe also asked for both sides to comment on a ruling by the European Court of Justice in a similar case that found \"Neither the functionality of a computer program nor the programming language and the format of data files used in a computer program in order to exploit certain of its functions constitute a form of expression. Accordingly, they do not enjoy copyright protection.\"\nOn May 31, 2012 the judge ruled that \"So long as the specific code used to implement a method is different, anyone is free under the Copyright Act to write his or her own code to carry out exactly the same function or specification of any methods used in the Java API.\"\n\nIn reviewing the \"Oracle v. Google\" case history, the court noted:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23589852", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23589852", "title": "Treaty of Tientsin (1885)", "text": "Treaty of Tientsin (1885)\n\nThe Treaty of Tientsin, signed on 9 June 1885, officially ended the Sino-French War. The unequal treaty, in ten articles, restated in greater detail the main provisions of the Tientsin Accord, signed between France and China on 11 May 1884. As Article 2 required China to recognise the French protectorate over Annam and Tonkin established by the Treaty of Hue in June 1884, implicitly abandoning her own claims to suzerainty over Vietnam, the treaty formalised France's victory in the Sino-French War.\n\nIn December 1884, alarmed by Japanese ambitions in Korea, Empress Dowager Cixi ordered her ministers to extricate China from the undeclared war with France that had broken out on 23 August. Important French victories in Tonkin and Formosa in February and early March 1885 strengthened her desire to end the Sino-French War, and although the Chinese won an unexpected victory in Tonkin in late March, defeating General de Négrier's 2nd Brigade at Bang Bo and reoccupying Lạng Sơn, this success was counterbalanced by the simultaneous French capture of the Pescadores Islands. Despite the fall of Jules Ferry's ministry in France at the end of March in the wake of the retreat from Lạng Sơn, China's position in early April 1885 was critical. Seizing the opportunity offered by the fall of the Ferry ministry, the Chinese agreed to implement the provisions of the May 1884 Tientsin Accord, which recognised France's protectorate over Vietnam. In return, the French dropped their longstanding demand for an indemnity for the Bắc Lệ ambush. After a flurry of negotiations in Paris in the first days of April 1885, peace was made on this basis.\n\nPreliminaries of peace between France and China were signed on 4 April 1885. The preliminary peace protocol provided for an immediate ceasefire in both Tonkin and Formosa. The French agreed to lift their blockade of Formosa immediately, and the Chinese agreed to withdraw their armies from Tonkin by the end of May 1885. As a surety for Chinese good faith, the French maintained their 'rice blockade' of the Yangtze River and the Chinese ports of Chen-hai (镇海) and Pak-hoi (北海), and continued to occupy Keelung and the Pescadores Islands.\n\nThe Chinese punctiliously observed the terms of the peace settlement, and both the Yunnan and Guangxi armies dutifully withdrew from Tonkin. Recognising the practical difficulties faced by Tang Jingsong's Yunnan Army, deep in Tonkinese territory around Hưng Hóa, the French extended the deadline specified in the accord of 4 April for its withdrawal, and the Yunnan Army finally crossed the border into China at Lào Cai on 2 June 1885. Under pressure from the Chinese commanders, Liu Yung-fu's Black Flag Army also withdrew from Tonkinese territory. Satisfied that China intended to honour its obligations, the French government consented to the conclusion of a definitive peace treaty between France and China.\n\nA comprehensive peace treaty in ten articles, based on the provisions of the Tientsin Accord of 11 May 1884, was signed at Tientsin on 9 June 1885, by Li Hung-chang for China and by Jules Patenôtre for France.\n\nLi Hung-chang had earlier negotiated the Tientsin Accord, and had been widely criticised in China for giving away too much to France. Conservative literati prevented the provisions of the Tientsin Accord from being put into effect, resulting in a clash between French and Chinese troops at Bắc Lệ in Tonkin. This confrontation had led directly to the outbreak of the Sino-French War on 23 August 1884. Although the hardline elements in the Ch'ing court were unable to prevent the empress dowager from again appointing Li Hung-chang to negotiate a peace treaty with the French, they insisted that Li was accompanied by two members of the Tsungli Yamen, Hsi Chen and Teng Ch'eng-hsiu (鄧承修). Teng Ch'eng-hsiu was a prominent member of the hardline Purist party (\"ch'ing-liu\") and his appointment, a deliberate insult to Li Hung-chang, was one of the last occasions on which the Purists were able to influence court policy. Discredited by China's defeat in the Sino-French War, the Purists rapidly lost influence at court thereafter.\n\nTreaty of Peace, Friendship and Commerce, concluded between France and China at Tientsin on 9 June 1885\n\nThe President of the French Republic and His Majesty the Emperor of China, animated, the one and the other, by an equal desire to put an end to the difficulties they have given each other by their simultaneous interventions in the affairs of Annam, and wishing to reestablish and ameliorate the former relations of friendship and commerce which existed between France and China, have resolved to conclude a new treaty responding to the common interests of the two nations, based on the Preliminary Convention signed at Tientsin, 11 May 1884, and ratified by imperial Decree, 13 April 1885.\n\nTo that effect, the two High Contracting Parties have designated their plenipotentiaries, to wit: the President of the French Republic: M. JULES PATENÔTRE, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of France in China, Officer of the Légion d'Honneur, Grand-Cross of the Polar Star of Sweden, etc; and His Majesty the Emperor of China: LI HUNG-CHANG, Imperial Commissioner, First Grand Secretary of State, Tutor of the Heir Presumptive, Superintendent of Trade of the Northern Ports, Governor-General of the Province of Chihli, holder of the First Degree of the Third Rank of Nobility, with the title \"Souyi\"; assisted by HSI CHEN, Imperial Commissioner, Member of the Council of Foreign Affairs, President of the Ministry of Justice, Administrator of the Treasure of the Ministry of Finances, Director of the Schools for the Education of the Hereditary Officers of the Left Wing of the Tartar Army of Peking, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Contingent of the Yellow Bordered Banner; and TENG CH’ENG-HSIU, Imperial Commissioner, Member of the Ceremonial Estate; who, after communicating to each other their plenipotentiary powers, which they have recognized as in good and due form, are agreed on the following Articles.\n\nARTICLE ONE\n\nFrance engages herself to reestablish and maintain order in the provinces of Annam which border upon the Chinese Empire. To that effect, she will take the measures necessary to disperse or expel the bands of pillagers and vagabonds which compromise the public tranquility, thus preventing it from reforming itself. Nevertheless, French troops will not cross the frontier which separates Tonkin from China, a frontier which France promises to respect and guarantee against all aggression.\n\nOn her side, China engages herself to disperse or expel the bands which take refuge in her provinces bordering on Tonkin, and to disperse those which seek to organize themselves on her territory in order to spread trouble among the populations placed under the protection of France, and in consideration of the guarantees which have been accorded to her for the security of her frontier, she categorically pledges not to send troops to Tonkin.\n\nThe High Contracting Parties will fix by a special convention the conditions under which wrongdoers will be extradited between China and Annam. Chinese colonists or former soldiers who live peaceably in Annam, earning their living by agriculture, industry or commerce and whose conduct is above reproach, shall enjoy the same security for their persons and their goods as French protégés.\n\nARTICLE TWO\n\nChina, having decided to do nothing which could compromise the work of pacification undertaken by France, engages herself to respect, in the present and in the future, the treaties, conventions and arrangements directly concluded or to be concluded between France and Annam.\n\nIn those things which concern the relationships between China and Annam, it is intended that they will be of a nature such as not to affront the dignity of the Chinese Empire, and not to lead to any violation of the present treaty.\n\nARTICLE THREE\n\nAfter an interval of six months from the signature of the present treaty, commissioners designated by the High Contracting Parties will go to delineate the frontier between China and Tonkin. They will place, wherever there is need, boundary markers designed to clearly delineate the line of demarcation. In the case where they can not agree among themselves on the placement of the markers or on the rectifications of detail in the actual frontier of Tonkin which it may be necessary to make in the common interest of both parties, they will refer it to their respective governments.\n\nARTICLE FOUR\n\nWhen the frontier has been identified, the French, French protégés and foreign inhabitants of Tonkin who wish to cross it in order to go to China will only be allowed to do so after having previously furnished themselves with passports delivered by Chinese authorities at the frontier on the request of the French authorities. For Chinese subjects, an authorization by the imperial Frontier Authorities will suffice.\n\nChinese subjects who wish to travel from China to Tonkin, by the land route, must be provided with regular passports by the French authorities on request by the Imperial Authorities.\n\nARTICLE FIVE\n\nImport and export trade will be permitted to French merchants or French protégés and to Chinese merchants on the land frontier between China and Tonkin. It must be carried out, however, at certain points which will be determined later and the choice as well as the number will be in agreement with the direction of flow as well as the importance of the traffic of the two countries. The regulations in force in the interior of the Chinese Empire will be taken into account in this respect.\n\nTwo trading posts will be designated on the Chinese frontier, one above Lào Cai and the other above Lạng Sơn. French merchants may establish themselves there under the same conditions and with the same advantages as in the treaty ports. The Government of His Majesty the Emperor of China will set up customs posts there, and the Government of the Republic will be able to maintain consuls there with the same privileges and prerogatives accorded to similar agents in the treaty ports.\n\nHis Majesty the Emperor of China may appoint consuls in the principal towns of Tonkin, subject to the agreement of the French Government.\n\nARTICLE SIX\n\nA special regulation, annexed to the present treaty, will specify the conditions in which will be carried out the land commerce between Tonkin and the Chinese provinces of Yunnan, Kwangsi and Kwangtung. That regulation will be prepared by commissioners who will be named by the High Contracting Parties within three months of the signing of the present treaty.\n\nThe merchandise which will be the object of this commerce will be subject to, on entering and leaving Tonkin and the provinces of Yunnan and Kwangsi, the same duties as those stipulated for foreign commerce. However, the reduced tariff will not be applied to merchandise transported across the land frontier between Tonkin and Kwangtung and will not have effect in the ports opened by the treaties.\n\nTrade in arms, machinery, provisions and munitions of war of all kinds will be subject to the laws and regulations laid down by each of the contracting states on its territory.\n\nThe export and import of opium will be regulated by special arrangements which will be part of the above mentioned commercial regulations.\n\nThe sea trade between China and Annam will be equally the object of a special regulation, provided that it contains no deviations from common practice.\n\nARTICLE SEVEN\n\nIn view of the development of conditions advantageous for commercial relations and neighbourliness which the present treaty has for its object to reestablish between France and China, the Government of the Republic will construct roads in Tonkin and will encourage the construction of railways there.\n\nWhen, on her side, China decides to construct railway tracks, it is intended that she will address herself to French industry, and the Government of the Republic will provide her with every facility for the procurement in France of the personnel that she needs. It is also intended that this clause will not be considered as constituting an exclusive privilege in favour of France.\n\nARTICLE EIGHT\n\nThe commercial stipulations of the present treaty and the regulations arising from them can be revised after an interval of ten years has elapsed, dating from the exchange of ratifications of the present treaty. But, in the case where, six months before the appointed time, neither one nor the other of the High Contracting Parties has manifested a desire to proceed with revision, the commercial stipulations will remain in force for a new period of ten years and so forth.\n\nARTICLE NINE\n\nAfter the present treaty has been signed, French forces will receive the order to retire from Keelung and to cease visitation, etc., on the high seas. Within one month after the signature of the present treaty, the Island of Formosa and the Pescadores will be entirely evacuated by French troops.\n\nARTICLE TEN\n\nThe provisions of older treaties, accords and conventions between France and China, not modified by the present treaty, remain in full force.\n\nThe present treaty will be ratified first by His Majesty the Emperor of China, and after that it will be ratified by the President of the French Republic, the exchange of ratifications to take place at Peking after the shortest possible delay.\n\nDone at Tientsin in four examples, 9 June 1885, corresponding to the 27th day of the fourth month of the eleventh year of Kuang-Hsü.\nThe signing of the treaty on 9 June was followed by a banquet at which the two plentipotentiaries expressed their satisfaction with the results of the negotiations. Patenôtre spoke as follows:\nI have every confidence that the diplomatic agreement we have just signed will do more than just put an end to our past disputes and—I hope—speedily efface them from our memory. By creating new links between France and China, by opening new markets for the commercial activity of all nations, the Treaty of 9 June will indubitably help to entrench and develop between the Chinese Empire and foreign countries that community of interests which has always most effectively cemented friendships between peoples. If the imperial government holds the same sentiments in this respect as the government of the Republic, this treaty will confer real and lasting benefits on everyone.\nLi Hung-chang made the following reply:\nWe Chinese have a saying: 'Friendship shines as brightly as the sun.' This proverb applies particularly to the bonds that link two great countries. China also desires the general welfare and wellbeing. From now on, the friendship between our two countries will shine as brightly as the morning sun when it emerges from the gloom of night.\n\nOn 10 June 1885, immediately after the signature of the peace treaty, the French lifted their naval blockade of the Yangtze River, Chen-hai and Pak-hoi. They evacuated Keelung on 21 June 1885 and the Pescadores Islands on 22 July 1885.\n\nRatifications of the Treaty of Tientsin were exchanged at Peking on 28 November 1885.\n\nArticle 3 of the treaty provided for the appointment of a Sino-French commission to demarcate the border between Tonkin and China. China's commissioners were Chou Te-jun (周德潤), Hung Lu-ssu (鴻臚寺) and Ch'ing Teng-ch'eng (卿鄧承). The French commission was led by M. Bourcier Saint-Chaffray, and its members included M. Scherzer, the French consul in Canton, Dr Paul Neis, a noted Indochina explorer, Lieutenant-Colonel Tisseyre, Captain Bouinais, and M. Pallu de la Barrière (though the latter took no part in the commission's work). In preparation for the commission's work General de Courcy despatched French troops to occupy Lạng Sơn, That Khe and other border towns in October 1885.\n\nDemarcation work began in late 1885 and was completed in 1887. The French rejected Chinese claims to the Vietnamese town of Dong Dang, close to the Guangxi border and the site of a French victory during the Sino-French War, but agreed that the Pak-lung peninsula (白龍尾) on the western border of Guangdong province should be awarded to China. A dispute over two areas on the border between Yunnan province and Tonkin was settled by the award of Meng-suo (猛梭) and Meng-lai (猛賴) to Vietnam and the transfer of a large tract of fertile arable land between Ma-pai-kuan (馬白關) and Nan-tan-shan (南丹山) to China. An agreement confirming the new border between Vietnam and China was signed in Peking on 26 June 1887 by French and Chinese representatives.\n\nThe peace treaty of 9 June 1885 formalised France's victory in the Sino-French War. Although the French were obliged to evacuate Keelung and the Pescadores Islands (which Admiral Courbet had wanted to retain as a French counterweight to the British colony of Hong Kong), the Chinese withdrawal from Tonkin left the way clear for the French to reoccupy Lạng Sơn and to advance up the Red River to Lào Cai on the Yunnan-Tonkin border. In the years that followed the French crushed a vigorous Vietnamese resistance movement and consolidated their hold on Annam and Tonkin. In 1887, Cochinchina, Annam and Tonkin (the territories which comprise the modern state of Vietnam) and Cambodia were incorporated into French Indochina. They were joined a few years later by Laos, ceded to France by Siam at the conclusion of the Franco-Siamese War of 1893.\n\n\n"}

Inevitably, the creditor which received the payment or assets has to return it to the liquidator. In some countries, the assets are treated in the normal way, and may be taken by any secured creditors who have a security interest which catches the assets (characteristically, a floating charge). However, some countries have \"ring-fenced\" recoveries of unfair preferences so that they are made available to the pool of assets for unsecured creditors.\n\nAn unfair preference has some of the same characteristics as a fraudulent conveyance, but legally they are separate concepts. There is not normally any requirement to prove an intention to defraud to recover assets under an unfair preference application. However, similar to fraudulent conveyance applications, unfair preferences are often seen in connection with asset protection schemes that are entered into too late by the putative bankrupt.\n\nMany jurisdictions provide for an exception in the case of transactions entered into in the ordinary course of business with a view to keeping the company trading, and such transactions are usually either validated or presumed to be validated.\n\n\nA preference in U.S. federal bankruptcy law is a transfer of property by a debtor to its creditor, on account of a pre-existing debt, that is made while the debtor is insolvent and gives the creditor more than it would obtain in a liquidation of the debtor's assets in a bankruptcy proceeding. It is primarily a creature of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, although some states have similar state laws. If the preferential transaction takes place within a specified period of time before the filing of bankruptcy by or on behalf of the debtor, then the debtor's trustee in bankruptcy is authorized to recover the property preferentially transferred. The mechanism of recovery is the avoidance of the transfer. After such avoidance, the recovered property becomes property of the bankruptcy estate. The period is usually 90 days. However, if the preferential transfer is made to an \"insider,\" then the period is one year. An \"insider\" is generally a relative or one who has the ability to control the activities of the debtor. The Bankruptcy Code provides some exemptions from these rules to accommodate transfers intended to be contemporaneous, made in the ordinary course of business or to the extent they are made for new value, and others.\n\nAll of the following examples assume that the requirements for a preference that are set out above exist at the time the transfer is made.\n\n\nUnder Swiss law, creditors who hold a certificate of unpaid debts against the debtor, or creditors in a bankruptcy, may file suit against third parties who have benefited from unfair preferences or fraudulent transfers by the debtor prior to a seizure of assets or a bankruptcy.\n\n"}

Modeled after ASCAP (The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers), VAGA acts as a clearinghouse for licensing reproduction rights to publishers, museums, film production companies, auction houses, galleries, multinational corporations, and other users of art. In addition, VAGA protects its members from infringements, advises on all aspects of intellectual property law, and advocates for artists’ rights. VAGA represents artists worldwide, both directly and through agreements with affiliated organizations in other countries. As a member of CISAC, the international confederation of societies that represent creators, VAGA takes part in establishing the international standards that govern the use of copyrighted works.\n\nVAGA works to improve artists’ rights through consultation with the U.S. Copyright Office and by lobbying Congress for improved rights legislation.\n\nVAGA, along with other rights organizations, recently initiated the introduction of the American Royalties Too (ART) Act. The bill was introduced in the House of Representatives by Rep. Jerrold Nadler and in the Senate by Senators Tammy Baldwin and Ed Markey. If enacted, the bill will establish a resale royalty, whereby the creator of a work would receive a percentage of the sale of that work when it is resold at auction.\n\nIn 2012, the U.S. Copyright Office reviewed the viability of a resale royalty law in the U.S. VAGA submitted public comments in support of such a law, and addressed the concerns of critics. VAGA's Executive Director, Robert Panzer, also participated in roundtable discussions hosted by the U.S. Copyright Office in order to advocate for a resale royalty law. The findings of the Office’s review were determinedly in favor of a resale royalty law in the US.\n\n"}

It was originally released in China in 2007. The Vii was not intended to be a seventh-generation console like the Wii, and was instead part of the dedicated console genre of inexpensive consoles with built-in games. It is based on the 16-bit Sunplus SPG CPU.\n\nThe Vii's Puppy Rod 威力棒 controller is similar in size and design to the Wii Remote. It features motion detection but not the pointing capability of the Wii Remote. The Vii Power Rods also come in \"Arctic White\", \"Hot Pink\" and \"Mint Blue\".\n\nA redesign of the console, colloquially called the Vii 2 by bloggers, features remodeled controllers and a console design reminiscent of the Nintendo Entertainment System and the PlayStation 3, as well as support for both NTSC and PAL televisions.\n\nIn 2008, the Vii was released in Japan under the name V Sports (Sport Vii).\n\n\nIn addition to the games that were included with the first release of the Vii (\"Free Craps\", which was not included on Vii 2), all models of the Vii also include a cartridge entitled \"7in1\" or \"10in1\" which features seven or ten additional games.\n\nThree different cartridges exist:\n\nVC-1 Exclusives:\n\n\"VC-1 and VC-2 cartridges contain:\"\n\nSeveral other games have also been released in cartridge format. Some examples of these are:\n\nVC-2 Exclusives:\n\nVC-3 Exclusives:\n\nThe games listed below are games that are also on the VG Pocket Caplet, a handheld also made by JungleTac.\n\n\nWhile the Vii itself appears to no longer be in production, JungleTac produced games for at least three other similar plug-and-play consoles, the Zone 60, the Wireless 60, and the Wireless Air 60, which has been described as the worst gaming console of all time. Many Vii titles and similar games appear on these consoles. However, these consoles' controllers do not have true motion sensors as the Vii does (with the exception of the Wireless Air 60), so the controls are simplified to the point where any motion just triggers a press of the A button. As a result, many of the games need to use power meters to determine distance or power.\n\nTitles that appear are:\n\n\n"}

The Wellington Convention played a role in the 1991 United Nations General Assembly's resolution calling for a global moratorium of driftnet fishing on the high seas.\n\nThe Convention was concluded at Wellington on 24 November 1989. It was opened for signature to states which have territory within the South Pacific. The Convention was signed by Australia, Cook Islands, Fiji, France, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, United States, and Vanuatu.\n\nOf the states that signed the Convention, it has not been ratified by France, Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. Samoa, which did not sign the Convention, has acceded to it. Additionally, Papua New Guinea has notified New Zealand—the depositary state—that the prohibitions of the Convention had been taken into account when Papua New Guinea enacted its Fisheries Act 1994.\n\nOn 20 December 1991, the UN General Assembly passed the Resolution on Large-scale Pelagic Driftnet Fishing and its Impact on the Living Marine Resources of the World’s Oceans and Seas. The resolution called for a worldwide moratorium on driftnet fishing and cited the entry into force of the Wellington Convention as contributing support to such a moratorium.\n\nThe Convention has two Protocols that supplement it. Both were concluded at Noumea, New Caledonia on 20 October 2000\n\nRatification of Protocol I allows states that do not have territory in the Convention Area to nevertheless agree that they will prohibit their nationals and their fishing vessels from using driftnets while fishing in the Convention Area. Protocol I has been ratified only by the United States; it entered into force for the U.S. on 28 February 1992.\n\nRatification of Protocol II allows states that do not have territory in the Convention Area but have territory in the waters that are contiguous to the Convention Area to nevertheless agree that they will prohibit their nationals and their fishing vessels from using driftnets while fishing in the Convention Area. Protocol II has been ratified by Chile (5 October 1993) and Canada (28 August 1998).\n\n\n"}
