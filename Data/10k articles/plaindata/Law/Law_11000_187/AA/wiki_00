Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495 (1935), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States that invalidated regulations of the poultry industry according to the nondelegation doctrine and as an invalid use of Congress' power under the commerce clause. This was a unanimous decision that rendered the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933, a main component of President Roosevelt's New Deal, unconstitutional.\n\nThe regulations at issue were promulgated under the authority of the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) of 1933. These included price and wage fixing, as well as requirements regarding the sale of whole chickens, including unhealthy ones. The government claimed the Schechters sold sick poultry, which has led to the case becoming known as \"the sick chicken case\". Also encompassed in the decision were NIRA provisions regarding maximum work hours and a right of unions to organize. The ruling was one of a series which overturned elements of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal legislation between January 1935 and January 1936, until the Court's intolerance of economic regulations shifted with \"West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish\". The National Industrial Recovery Act allowed local codes for trade to be written by private trade and industrial groups. The President could choose to give some codes the force of law. The Supreme Court's opposition to an active federal interference in the local economy caused Roosevelt to attempt to pack the Court with judges that were in favor of the New Deal.\n\nThere were originally sixty charges against Schechter Poultry, which were reduced to eighteen charges plus charges of conspiracy by the time the case was heard by the U. S. Supreme Court.\n\nAmong the eighteen charges against Schechter Poultry were \"the sale to a butcher of an unfit chicken\" and the sale of two uninspected chickens.\n\nTen charges were for violating codes requiring \"straight killing\". Straight killing prohibited customers from selecting the chickens they wanted; instead a customer had to place his hand in the coop and select the first chicken that came to hand. There was laughter during oral arguments when Justice Sutherland asked, \"Well suppose however that all the chickens have gone over to one end of the coop?\"\n\nChief Justice Hughes wrote for a unanimous Court in invalidating the industrial \"codes of fair competition\" which the NIRA enabled the President to issue. The Court held that the codes violated the constitutional separation of powers as an impermissible delegation of legislative power to the executive branch. The Court also held that the NIRA provisions were in excess of congressional power under the Commerce Clause.\n\nThe Court distinguished between direct effects on interstate commerce, which Congress could lawfully regulate, and indirect, which were purely matters of state law. Though the raising and sale of poultry was an interstate industry, the Court found that the \"stream of interstate commerce\" had stopped in this case—Schechter's slaughterhouses chickens were sold exclusively to intrastate buyers. Any interstate effect of Schechter was indirect, and therefore beyond federal reach.\n\nThough many considered the NIRA a \"dead statute\" at this point in the New Deal scheme, the Court used its invalidation as an opportunity to affirm constitutional limits on congressional power, for fear that it could otherwise reach virtually anything that could be said to \"affect\" interstate commerce and intrude on many areas of legitimate state power. The court ruled that the law violated the Tenth Amendment. According to Supreme Court historian David P. Currie, the court believed that \"to permit Congress to regulate the wages and hours in a tiny slaughterhouse because of remote effects on interstate commerce would leave nothing for the tenth amendment to reserve.\" Currie added that \"it can hardly have escaped the Justices that apart from its limitation to business there was little to distinguish what Congress had attempted from the 1933 legislation authorizing Adolf Hitler to govern Germany by decree ... the delegation decision in \"Schechter\" was a salutary reminder of the Framers' decision to vest legislative power in a representative assembly.\"\n\nJustice Cardozo's concurring opinion clarified that a spectrum approach to direct and indirect effects is preferable to a strict dichotomy. Cardozo felt that in this case, Schechter was simply too small a player to be relevant to interstate commerce.\n\nThis traditional reading of the Commerce Clause was later disavowed by the Court, which after threats from Roosevelt began to read congressional power more expansively in this area, in cases such as \"NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp\". However, more recent cases such as \"United States v. Lopez\" perhaps signal a growing inclination in the Court to once again affirm limits on its scope. In a unanimous 2011 decision, \"Bond v. United States\", the Supreme Court cited \"Schechter\" as a precedent.\n\nSpeaking to aides of Roosevelt, Justice Louis Brandeis remarked that, “This is the end of this business of centralization, and I want you to go back and tell the president that we're not going to let this government centralize everything.\"\n\nIn Hyde Park a few days after the decision, Roosevelt denounced the decision as an antiquated interpretation of the Commerce Clause.\n\nAfter the decision was announced, newspapers reported that 500 cases of NIRA code violations were going to be dropped.\n\nGlen Asner, a descendant of the Schechters, said that the brothers probably voted for Roosevelt in all four of his presidential campaigns. Their main political concern in the 1930s was anti-Semitism. The Schechters felt that without the New Deal, America could have taken the route of Nazi Germany.\n\n\n"}

The act facilitates accountability and transparency of government activities and protects the rights of citizens to participate in State government deliberations. Similarly, California's Brown Act of 1953 protects citizen rights with regard to open meetings at the county and local government level.\n\nThe act also reaffirms, \"The people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies which serve them.

An accused person is subject to Sharia, which, according to some interpretations, prescribes death for blasphemy.\n\nYemen's constitution declares that Islam is the state religion. Non-Muslims are barred from holding elected office. Yemen’s legal system is a mixture of Islamic legal principles, old Egyptian laws, and Napoleonic codes. Islamic legal principles are applied in all courts—not just in Sharia courts.\n\nUnder Sharia, blasphemy is an instance of apostasy. Sharia says apostasy is a Hadd offence (an offence against God). In some jurisdictions, Sharia is understood to prescribe the death penalty for Hadd offences.\n\nInformation about blasphemy in Yemen is difficult to obtain because government authorities severely restrict the freedom of the press. Human rights abuses are common.\n\nThe Salafi movement in Yemen is a redoubtable force against blasphemy. The movement has more than 120 centers and more than 700 mosques. The movement condemns as blasphemous all actions that promote democracy, and calls those who participate in such actions \"atheists\" and \"sinners\".\n\nIn 2005, on behalf of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, Yemen introduced to the United Nations General Assembly the first resolution that called upon the world to take action against the \"defamation of religion\".\n\nIn 2008, Yemeni authorities arrested Firass Al-Yafi'ee, a journalist who had been an irritant to the government since the late 1990s, on charges of drinking alcohol and committing blasphemy. During Al-Yafi'ee's trial, a fatwa appeared. The fatwa accused Al-Yafi'ee of insulting the Quran, and called for his death. Judge Anwar Al-Sayed convicted Al-Yafi'ee on one charge: drinking alcohol, and sentenced him to receive eighty lashes.\n\nIn 2000, Abdul Karim Al-Razihi fled to the Netherlands because of the campaign waged against him by Salafyoon mosques, Aden. The mosques accused al-Razihi of atheism and infidelity because of his poem titled \"A Summer Night Dream.\" The mosques claimed that al-Razihi blamed angels and acquitted Satan where the poem states, \"A Satan sees me and an angel seduced me.\"\nIn 2000, zealots orchestrated a campaign against Samir al-Yusuf for reprinting one of the classics of modern Yemeni literature, \"Sana: An Open City\" by Muhammad ‘Abd al-Wali (1940–73). The zealots accused al-Yusuf of disseminating blasphemy.\n"}

{"id": "218845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=218845", "title": "Civil code", "text": "Civil code\n\nA civil code is a systematic collection of laws designed to deal with the core areas of private law such as for dealing with business and negligence lawsuits and practices. A jurisdiction that has a civil code generally also has a code of civil procedure. In some jurisdictions with a civil code, a number of the core areas of private law that would otherwise typically be codified in a civil code may instead be codified in a commercial code.\n\nThe concept of codification dates back to ancient Babylon. The earliest surviving civil code is the Code of Ur-Nammu, in . 2100–2050 BC. The Corpus Juris Civilis, a codification of Roman law produced between 529-534 AD by the Byzantine emperor Justinian I, forms the basis of civil law legal systems.\n\nOther codified laws used since ancient times include various texts used in religious laws, such as the Law of Manu in Hindu law, the Mishnah in Jewish Halakha law, the Canons of the Apostles in Christian Canon law, and the Qur'an and Sunnah in Islamic Sharia law to some extent.\n\nThe idea of codification re-emerged during the Age of Enlightenment, when it was believed that all spheres of life could be dealt with in a conclusive system based on human rationality, following from the experience of the early codifications of Roman Law during the Roman Empire.\n\nThe first attempts at modern codification were made in the second half of the 18th century in Germany, when the states of Austria, Prussia, Bavaria and Saxony began to codify their laws. The first statute that used this denomination was the \"Codex Maximilianeus bavaricus civilis\" of 1756 in Bavaria, still using the Latin language. It was followed in 1792 by a legal compilation that included civil, penal, and constitutional law, the \"Allgemeines Landrecht für die Preussischen Staaten\" (General National Law for the Prussian States) promulgated by King Frederick II the Great. In Austria, the first step towards fully-fledged codification were the yet incomplete Codex Theresianus (compiled between 1753 and 1766), the Josephinian Code (1787) and the complete West Galician Code (enacted as a test in Galicia in 1797). The final Austrian Civil Code (called \"Allgemeines bürgerliches Gesetzbuch\", ABGB) was only completed in 1811 after the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire under the influence of the Napoleonic Wars. One of the very first countries to follow up through legal transplants in codification was Serbia, the Serbian Civil Code (1844).\n\nMeanwhile, the French Napoleonic code (\"Code Civil\") was enacted in 1804 after only a few years of preparation, but it was a child of the French Revolution, which is strongly reflected by its content. The French code was the most influential one because it was introduced in many countries standing under French occupation during the Napoleonic Wars. In particular, countries such as Italy, the Benelux countries, Spain, Portugal (with the Civil Code of 1867, later replaced by the Civil Code of 1966, which is strongly influenced by the German BGB), the Latin American countries, the province of Quebec in Canada, the state of Louisiana in the United States, and all other former French colonies which base their civil law systems to a strong extent on the Napoleonic Code.\n\nThe late 19th century and the beginning 20th century saw the emergence of the School of Pandectism, whose work peaked in the German Civil Code (BGB), which was enacted in 1900 in the course of Germany's national unification project, and in the Swiss Civil Code (\"Zivilgesetzbuch\") of 1907. Those two codes had been most advanced in their systematic structure and classification from fundamental and general principles to specific areas of law (e.g. contract law, labour law, inheritance law). While the French Civil Code was structured in a \"casuistic\" approach attempting to regulate every possible case, the German BGB and the later Swiss ZGB applied a more abstract and systematic approach. Therefore, the BGB had a great deal of influence on later codification projects in countries as diverse as Japan, Greece, Turkey, Portugal (1966 Civil Code) and Macau (1999 Civil Code).\n\nSince 2002 with the First law of the Civil Code of Catalonia, Parliament of Catalonia's several laws have approved the successive books of the Civil Code of Catalonia. This has replaced most of the Compilation of the Civil Law of Catalonia, several special laws and two partial codes. Only the Sixth book, relating to obligations and contracts, has to be approved.\n\nIn Europe, apart from the common law countries of the United Kingdom and Ireland, only Scandinavia remained untouched by the codification movement. The particular tradition of the civil code originally enacted in a country is often thought to have a lasting influence on the methodology employed in legal interpretation. Scholars of comparative law and economists promoting the legal origins theory of (financial) development usually subdivide the countries of the civil law tradition as belonging either to the French, Scandinavian or German group (the latter including Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea).\nThe first civil code promulgated in Canada was that of New Brunswick of 1804, inspired by the 1800 project of the French civil code, known as the \"Projet de l'an VIII\" (project of the 8th year); nevertheless, in 1808 a \"Digeste de la loi civile\" was sanctioned.\n\nIn the United States, codification appears to be widespread at a first glance, but U.S. legal codes are actually collections of common law rules and a variety of \"ad hoc\" statutes; that is, they do not aspire to complete logical coherence. For example, the California Civil Code largely codifies common law doctrine and is very different in form and content from all other civil codes.\n\nIn 1825, Haiti promulgated a \"Code Civil\", that was simply a copy of the Napoleonic one; while Louisiana abolished its \"Digeste\", replacing it with the \"Code Civil de l'État de la Louisiane\" the same year.\n\nThe Mexican state of Oaxaca promulgated the first Latin American civil code in 1827, copying the French civil code.\n\nLater on, in 1830, the civil code of Bolivia, a summarized copy of the French one, was promulgated by Andrés de Santa Cruz. The latest, with some changes, was adopted by Costa Rica in 1841.\n\nThe Dominican Republic, in 1845, put into force the original Napoleonic code, in French language (a translation in Spanish was published in 1884).\n\nIn 1852, Peru promulgated its own civil code (based on a project of 1847), which was not a simple copy or imitation of the French one, but presented a more original text based on the Castillan law (of Roman origin) that was previously in force on the Peruvian territory.\n\nChile promulgated its civil code in 1855, an original work in confront with the French code both for the scheme and for the contents (similar to the Castillan law in force in that territory) that was written by Andrés Bello (begun in 1833). This code was integrally adopted by Ecuador in 1858; El Salvador in 1859; Venezuela in 1862 (only during that year); Nicaragua in 1867; Honduras in 1880 (until 1899, and again since 1906); Colombia in 1887; and Panama (after its separation from Colombia in 1903).\n\nIn 1865, the Code Civil du Bas-Canada (or Civil Code of Lower Canada) was promulgated in Lower Canada (later the Canadian province of Quebec). It was replaced in 1991 by a new Civil Code of Quebec, which came into effect in 1994.\n\nUruguay promulgated its code in 1868, and Argentina in 1869 (work by Dalmacio Vélez Sársfield). Paraguay adopted its code in 1987, and in 1877 Guatemala adopted the Peruvian code of 1852.\n\nNicaragua in 1904 replaced its civil code of 1867 by adopting the Argentine code. In 1916 Brazil enacted its civil code (project of Clovis Bevilacqua, after rejecting the project by Teixeira de Freitas that was translated by the Argentines to prepare their project), that entered into effect in 1917 (in 2002, the Brazilian Civil Code was replaced by a new text). Brazilian Civil Code of 1916 was considered, by many, as the last code of the 19th century despite being adopted in the 20th century. The reason behind that is that the Brazilian Code of 1916 was the last of the important codes from the era of codifications in the world that had strong liberal influences, and all other codes enacted thereafter were deeply influenced by the social ideals that emerged after World War I and the Soviet Socialist Revolution.\n\nPanama in 1916 decided to adopt the Argentine code, replacing its code of 1903.\n\nCuba had the old Civil Code of Spain until the year 1987 when the National Assembly of People's Power approved the Cuban Civil Code, Law 59.\n\nThe Portuguese Civil Code of 1868 was introduced in the Portuguese overseas territories of Asia (Portuguese India, Macau and Portuguese Timor) from 1870, with local modifications being latter introduced. It continued to be in effect in the former Portuguese India even after the end of the Portuguese rule in 1961. It is still in force in the present Indian territories of Goa (locally referred as the Goa civil code), Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli. As Macau and Portuguese Timor were still under Portuguese rule when the Portuguese Civil Code of 1868 was replaced by that of 1966, this later was adopted by these territories. In East Timor (ex-Portuguese Timor), the Portuguese Code was replaced by the Indonesian Code when Indonesia occupied that territory in 1975. Macau adopted its own Civil Code in 1999, although this being based in the Portuguese Code of 1966.\nAlso the civil code of Spain of 1889 would be enforced in its colony, the Philippines, and this would remain in effect even after the end of Spanish rule until the Philippines enacted its own Civil Code in 1950 after almost fifty years of U.S. rule.\n\nMany legal systems of other countries in Asia are within the civil law tradition and have enacted a civil code, mostly derived from the German civil code; that is the case of Japan, Korea, Thailand (the Civil and Commercial Code), Taiwan and Indonesia (which is influenced by the Dutch Civil Code, ).\n\nA typical civil code deals with the fields of law known to the common lawyer as law of contracts, torts, property law, family law and the law of inheritance. Commercial law, corporate law and civil procedure are usually codified separately.\n\nThe older civil codes such as the French, Egyptian, Austrian and Spanish ones are structured under the Institutional System of the Roman jurist Gaius and generally have three large parts:\n\nThe newer codes such as the ones of Germany, Switzerland, Greece, Portugal, Romania and Catalonia are structured according to the Pandectist System:\n\nThe civil code of the state of Louisiana, following the institutions system, is divided into five parts:\n\nPandectism also had an influence on the earlier codes and their interpretation. For example, Austrian civil law is typically taught according to the Pandect System (which was devised by German scholars in the time between the enactment of the Austrian and the German Codes), even though this is not consistent with the structure of the Code.\n\nThe following is the list of national or regional civil codes by alphabetic order of names of countries or regions:\n\n"}
{"id": "1346922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1346922", "title": "Container-deposit legislation", "text": "Container-deposit legislation\n\nContainer-deposit legislation (also known as a deposit-refund system, bottle bill, or deposit-return system) is any law that requires the collection of a monetary deposit on beverage containers (refillable or non-refillable) at the point of sale. When the container is returned to an authorized redemption center, or retailer in some jurisdictions, the deposit is partly or fully refunded to the redeemer (presumed to be the original purchaser). It is a deposit-refund system.\n\nGovernments may pass container deposit legislation for several reasons, including, for example:\n\nDeposits that are not redeemed are often kept by distributors or bottlers to cover the costs of the system (including handling fees paid to retailers or redemption enters to collect, sort, and handle the containers) or are escheated to the governmental entity involved to fund environmental programs. \n\nA & R Thwaites & Co in Dublin, Ireland, announced in 1799 the provision of artificial \"soda water\" and that they paid 2 shillings a dozen for returned bottles. Schweppes that also was in the business of artificially made mineral waters, had a similar recycling policy about 1800, without any legislation. Scottish bottled beverage companies also voluntarily introduced such a scheme to encourage the return of their bottles for reuse. In Sweden a standard system for deposits on bottles and recycling was established in 1884, eventually by law. The popular demand for a deposit on aluminium cans to reduce littering led to legislation in 1984.\n\nIn North America, British Columbia's legislated deposit-return system, enacted in 1970, is the oldest such program in North America.\n\nIn the days when bottles were washed and re-used, drinks manufacturers paid for the return of their (proprietary) containers, but with the advent of single-use containers great savings were possible, leaving their disposal as the consumer's responsibility.\n\nWhile a national scheme has been repeatedly delayed largely due to unveiled threats from the beverage industry of multimillion-dollar ad campaigns against politicians who support it and disagreements between the states, there has been a growing momentum of state-based operated container deposit schemes (CDS). Currently all states except Victoria and Tasmania look to have some sort of state-based container deposit scheme operating within the next 2 years. With 8 billion beverage containers landfilled or littered every year in Australia, proponents argue that it is the most effective method to reduce such litter; and improve recycling above that achieved by kerbside. It also has many co-benefits such as funds for charities and several thousand new jobs, that cannot be achieved by other approaches.\n\nSmaller beer bottles (250 or 330 mL) carry a €0.10 deposit, and larger ones (750 mL or 1 L) a €0.20 one. Some fruit-juice bottles, such as those sold by Oxfam Wereldwinkels/Magasins du Monde], carry a €0.30 deposit. Some hard plastic milk bottles such as those sold by Delhaize carry a €0.20 deposit.\n\nIn 1970, British Columbia became the first Canadian province to establish a mandatory deposit-return system for soft drinks and beer containers. Today, nearly all provinces and territories in Canada have followed suit; the territory of Nunavut is the only jurisdiction in Canada that has yet to implement some sort of deposit refund system. \n\nDeposits range from CAD$0.05 to CAD$0.40 per unit depending on the material and size of the container and whether the container contains an alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverage. \n\nBelow is a brief summary of each program:\n\n\nSince 2006, a refundable deposit of 0.5 HRK (Croatian Kuna) has been levied on non-refillable containers (except dairy products) with minimum volume of 200ml. Retailers over 200m2 are obliged to take-back containers. Collection is mostly manual, although some collection occurs with reverse vending machines. Retailers must sort containers by material type (PET bottles, aluminum/steel cans, and glass bottles). The scheme is government operated and there is a collection target of 95%. In 2015, the scheme recovered up to 90% of all non-refillable containers placed on the Croatian market. \n\nIn the Czech Republic most beer is sold in returnable glass bottles that carry a CZK 3 deposit. These bottles are collected by shops and supermarkets. Reverse vending machines have mostly replaced human staff. There is also a CZK 100 deposit on plastic beer crates with a 20 bottle capacity. Most reverse vending machines accept an entire crate full of empty bottles, returning CZK 160. There is no deposit on other containers.\n\nIn Denmark the selling of aluminium beverage cans was forbidden between 1982 and 2002. However this regulation violated European Union law. Therefore, the EU forced Denmark to replace it, and the new legislation, passed in 2002, introduced a container deposit scheme. The law covers beer (alcohol content >0.5% by volume), carbonated soft drinks (alcohol content 0-0.5%), energy drinks, mineral water, iced tea, ready-to-drink beverages, and mixer products (alcohol content 0.5%-10%). Excluded from the scheme are fruit squash, juice, cocoa, wine and spirits, and milk. The deposit levels are as follows: \nThe deposit system operator is Dansk Retursystem A/S, a private non-profit organization. Most collection (95%) is done automatically using reverse vending machines, but some (5%) is done manually. In 2014, the system achieved a total return rate of 89%.\n\nIn Estonia there is a universal deposit and recycling system since 2005 for one-time and refillable containers. This includes soft drinks, water, beer, cider, juice, juice concentrates, nectars, and low-ethanol alcoholic beverages (up to 6% volume). It does not include strong alcoholic beverages such as wine or vodka, glass jars, or Tetra Paks. The deposit is €0.10 on all metal, plastic, and glass beverage containers of all sizes. The system is operated by Eesti Pandipakend OÜ, which is a producer responsibility organization representing the Estonian Association of Brewers, the Association of Producers of Soft Drinks, the Association of Importers of Soft Drinks and Beer, and the Estonian Retailers Association.\n\nIn 2015, 90% of all PET bottles, 70% of all aluminum cans and 87% of all glass bottles sold in Estonia were returned for recycling and/or reuse. The overall return rate was 82.3%. \n\nThe United Nations Development Programme had funded a feasibility study to look at the possibility of establishing a deposit-return system in Fiji, building on the experience gained from their successful projects in Kiribati and the Federated States of Micronesia.\n\nIn 2011, the Fijian Government approved the Environment Management [Waste Disposal and Recycling][Amendment] Regulations 2011, and the Environment Management [Container Deposit] Regulations 2011. The Regulations provide the legal framework for the introduction of a container deposit and refund system, allowing beverage producers and importers to adjust pricing and accommodate deposits. The Regulations will also allow the Department of Environment to register and establish the Managing Agency that will administer Fiji's container deposit system, and establish a revolving fund account to receive all deposits paid by producers for all beverages sold. No further details are available.\n\nDeposits were introduced on aluminum cans in 1996, on PET bottles in 2008, and on glass bottles in 2012. Almost all soft drinks are covered by the program, in addition to water, beer, cider, long drinks, sport drinks, juice, and liquor/spirits/wine sold by Alko. Milk is exempt. The system is administered by Suomen palautuspakkaus Oy (abbr. Palpa), which is a private consortium of beverage importers and manufacturers. In 2016, aluminum cans were recovered at a rate of 96%, PET bottles 92%, and one-way glass 88%. The deposit values for these containers are as follows: \n\n\nThe scheme is, in technical sense, voluntary and Palpa does not hold a legal monopoly for container deposits systems. However, it is the only such system in operation. Those beverage containers that do not belong to a container deposit system are levied an excise tax of €0.51/L, regardless of the container size. The tax is so high that essentially all beverage manufacturers and importers opt to join the Palpa system instead of paying the excise tax.\n\nIn Germany container deposit legislation, known as \"Einwegpfand\" (single-use deposit), was passed in 2002, and was implemented on 1 January 2003. However, its implementation was fought by lobby groups of German bottling industry and retailers. This fight also included trials at the Federal Administrative Court of Germany and the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany, but all trials were won by the German federal government. The deposit legislation covers plastic, aluminum, and glass containers for water, beer, mixed drinks containing beer, carbonated/non-carbonated soft drinks, and mixed alcoholic drinks. Excluded from the program are containers for fruit and vegetable juice, milk products, wine, spirits, liquors, and certain dietary drinks. Also excluded are containers smaller than 100mL and larger than 3L. At any given time, an estimated 2 billion beer bottles are in circulation in Germany, each of which sees an average of 36 reuses.\n\nAs of October 2016, the standard deposit for all single-use containers (cans, single-use glass and plastic bottles) 0.1L-3L in volume is €0.25. Retailers are only obliged to take back the material fractions that they sell. \n\nThe deposit for refillable bottles is not defined by law. The usual rates are locally €0.02 for some wine bottles, €0.08 for beer bottles up to 0.5 L, and €0.15 for beer bottles with flip-top closures, beer bottles over 0.5 L and other bottles (mostly water and soft-drinks, lesser fruit drinks, milk, cream, yoghurt). Some bottles have an even higher deposit. Bottle crates have a deposit of €1.50. Shops only accept bottles of sold vendors and sizes.\n\nGermany's collection system is 80% automated and 20% manual. Most supermarkets in Germany have a reverse vending machine that is designed to be used by customers and which scans \"Pfand\" returns and prints a receipt for the total value of the refund which can be exchanged for cash or put towards the cost of future purchases. \n\nSupermarkets near the Danish border have established a scheme, where Scandinavian residents are exempt from \"Pfand\", by signing an \"Export declaration\" and providing that cans are exported within 24 hours and the contents are not consumed within Germany.\n\nIn Hungary, beer, wine and standardized liquor bottles carry a deposit on them, which was liberalized in the recent past. Beer bottles have 25 forints on them, but for wine glasses and for liquor bottles, the sum is decided by the trader, which people can exploit by buying a drink in a certain retailer and bringing the bottle back to its rival who have a bigger deposit on it. PET bottles and metal beverage containers are taken back only by some super- and hypermarkets, such as Lidl, Auchan, Tesco, Interspar. They all use reverse vending machines to collect them: for bottles and in most places for the PET bottles they use a Wincor-Nixdorf or a Tomra machine, while ALU cans are collected by the Hungarian ALU-press machine. Its advantage is that it accepts flattened or pressed cans as well, and it crushes them with a pressing machine, thus improving the storage capacity of the machine. The containers' prices - 2 forints/ALU can and 1 forint/PET bottle - do not widely motivate people to revend these containers.\n\nIceland has had a deposit system on a national scale for a wide range of containers (plastic, aluminum, and glass) since 1989. All ready-to-drink beverages, wine, and liquor are included in the program. Milk, milk products, and juice extracts are excluded. The deposit is the same for all bottles and cans, ISK 16. \n\nThe recycling rate per product is approximately 90% aluminum, 87% PET, and 83% glass.\n\nIn Israel, there is a 0.30-shekel (₪) deposit on beverage containers over 100ml and under 5L, except for dairy products. The system is operated by the ELA Recycling Corporation, a private non-profit organization owned by Israel's beverage manufacturers. Businesses are required to accept bottles if they sold them, or if they are over 28 square meters and sell beverages from the same manufacturer or importer. Businesses are not required to accept more than 50 bottles per customer per day. The deposit was initially ₪0.25, but was raised shortly after the ₪0.05 coin was discontinued.\n\nIn 2015, the system achieved a total return rate of 77%.\n\nMost 500 mL beer bottles (local brands such as Goldstar and Maccabee plus certain imported ones like Carlsberg and Tuborg) have a deposit of ₪1.20, and are willingly accepted even by smaller businesses (plastic water bottles, glass wine bottles and soda cans are mostly accepted by larger supermarket chains, some of which possess reverse vending machines).\n\nThe container deposit legislation, as a monetary approach to the garbage/recycling problem, has never caught on in Japan. However, under increasingly ever stricter sorting rules announced by each town or city, garbage is meticuously sorted into kitchen garbage, newspapers/books, metal cans (washed)/plastic bottles (rinsed), garden weeds, etc. in each neighborhood for pickkup by collection cars, usually on different days notified by the local government. \n\nLithuania implemented container deposit legislation for single-use cans and bottles in February 2016. Lithuania's program is comprehensive and charges a deposit on nearly all types of beverage containers, including those made of plastic, metal, and glass 0.1L to 3L. The deposit is applicable to beer and beer cocktails; cider and other fermented beverages; mixed alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages; all types of water; juice and nectars (sold in glass, plastic, and metal packaging); and fruit wines and wine-product cocktails sold in plastic and metal packaging. Milk, wine, and spirits are exempt. The deposit is the same for all containers and is €0.10 per bottle/can, and most collection is done using reverse vending machines. \n\nLithuania's deposit return system is operated by Užstato Sistemos Administratorius (USAD). Container return rates for plastic bottles were 34% before the deposit scheme, 74.3% at end of 2016, 91.9% at end of 2017, and 93% in 2018.\n\nUnder the current deposit-return scheme, large polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles greater than 0.5L are subject to a €0.25 deposit, but only those for soft drinks and water. All other beverage types, such as medical drinks, wine, spirits, etc., are excluded. The system, which is operated by Stichting Retourverpakkingen NL, is mostly automated collection (89%) with only 11% of returns being done manually. Beer bottles carry a €0.10 deposit, and beer crates €1.50.\n\nIn 2014, the Netherlands' deposit system recovered 95% of the containers covered by the program.\n\nNew Zealand had no container-deposit legislation until 2008 when the Waste Minimisation Act 2008 passed into law. The Act has provision for product stewardship of which container-deposit legislation is the most familiar type. there is no widespread deposits available on containers with some beer bottles being a notable exception.\n\nAutomated recycling of bottles has been in use since the 1970s. Aluminum and steel beverage cans had a 5,60 kr surtax in Norway up until the end of the 20th century. In 1999, a container deposit legislation was passed, which also abolished this regulation. Today, these are the following container deposits in Norway:\n\nIn 2018 the rates were increased to 2 NOK (formerly 1 NOK) and 3 NOK (previously 2.50 NOK) due to inflation and the discontinuation of the 50-øre coin.\n\nInfinitum AS (formerly Norsk Resirk A/S) is responsible for operating the national recycling scheme for non-refillable plastic bottles and beverage cans in Norway. The non-profit corporation was founded in 1999 and is owned by companies and organizations in the beverage industry and food trading. \n\nThe Norwegian system works in such a way that the excise tax decreases as the returns increases, meaning that for example that 90 per cent returns for cans translates into a 90 per cent discount on the excise tax. This again allows drink products to be sold at lower prices.\n\nIn 2014, 95.4% of PET bottles and 96.6% of all drink cans in Norway were returned under the scheme. \n\nDeposits on drink containers have a long history in Norway, starting with deposits on beer bottles in 1902. The deposit back then was 0.06 kr (3.30 kr in 2006 currency value).\nThis deposit arrangement was later expanded to include soft drink bottles.\n\nUp until 1 January 2001, the Vinmonopolet government wine and spirits monopoly chain had deposits on products made by the company itself, this did not include imported products.\n\nAll sellers of deposit marked drinking containers are required by law to accept returns of empty containers for cash. As of 2016, drink containers can be returned and deposits retrieved at over 15,000 establishments in Norway. The collection system is 95% automated (using reverse vending machines) and only 5% manual. Most reverse vending machines in Norway are manufactured by Tomra Systems ASA.\n\nIn Sweden, there are deposits on nearly all ready-to-serve beverages, including beer, soft drinks, cider, and bottled water. Dairy products, vegetable juice, fruit juice, and berry drinks are excluded from the program. The deposit values are as follows: \nAB Svenska Returpack (Pantamera) is responsible for the deposit system for aluminium cans and PET bottles. The aluminum cans have had a deposit since 1984, and PET bottles since 1994. Svensk GlasÅtervinning AB is responsible for the deposit system of glass bottles. A glass bottle recycling system was introduced in 1884 and the bottles were first standardized in 1885.\n\nUntil 1998, the hard alcohol and wine bottles sold at Systembolaget — the government owned alcohol retail monopoly — had a deposit as well, but due to the deregulation of the Systembolaget's suppliers, the former sole supplier V&S Group dropped the deposit on their bottles due to the restricted bottle shapes giving V&S a disadvantage compared to the competitors. The bottles could be returned and deposit refunded until early 1999 at Systembolaget.\n\nThe legislation regarding container deposit systems was updated so that from January 1, 2006, containers from other plastics and metals, e.g., steel cans, can be included in the deposit systems. The law also makes it illegal in Sweden to sell consumption-ready beverages in containers that are not part of an authorized Swedish container deposit system, with the exception of beverages that mainly consist of dairy products or vegetable, fruit, or berry juice. However, private importation from (mainly Eastern European) countries without deposit occurs by vendors that thus compete with a somewhat lower customer price. The recycling of these contraband cans has not been seen as a problem, but Returpack made a campaign in 2010 offering 0.10 krona for each imported can (without deposit) to the benefit of WWF, retrieving 17 million cans. In 2011, a similar campaign was repeated, retrieving almost 18 million cans.\nNon-deposit glass containers are collected in large glass garbage bins, for clear or coloured glass, placed centrally in most urban areas.\n\nThe 1.5 L refillable PET bottle with a deposit of 4.00 kr has been discontinued, and has been replaced by the 1.5 L non-refillable PET bottle. The last day for returning bottles made by Spendrups for deposit was 30 June 2007, and the last day for bottles made by Coca-Cola Sweden was 30 June 2008.\n\nAlthough Sweden is one of the leading countries in recycling of beverage containters, Returpack uses TV commercials to promote more recycling. Commercials have been made with well-known melodies sung, like \"Guantanamera\" and \"Pata pata\"—sounding like Returpack's slogan \"panta mera\" (i.e., \"recycle more\").\n\nIn 2016, the overal recycling rate was 84.9% for both aluminum cans and PET bottles, which translates to 177 packages per person in Sweden.\n\nIn Switzerland, there is a government ruling that 75% of containers must be returned, otherwise a deposit system may be introduced.\n\nUntil the turn of the 21st century, most British bottled beer was sold (whether in off-licences or pubs) in standard quart, pint, half-pint or third-pint (nip) bottles, although some brewers preferred their own distinctive designs. The standard deposit was 7pence (p) for a pint bottle and 5p for a half-pint. However, in the absence of legislation, and given the switch from pub to supermarket sales, and from Imperial to metric measures, the industry has now entirely abandoned refillable bottles.\n\nBeer casks sold for the home or party consumption of draught beer are usually also loaned out against a deposit which may run to several tens of pounds.\n\nIn England, in January 2017, ministers were reported to be considering a 10p or 20p refundable deposit on plastic bottles and containers after Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas had voiced her support of such a scheme at the end of 2016. As of February 2017, the idea of a plastic bottle levy was unlikely as the government rejected the deposit scheme proposal. In March 2018, the UK government announced plans to introduce a deposit return scheme in England for drinks containers.\n\nAs of June 2015, Northern Ireland had been considering a drinks deposit scheme, following the publication of a feasibility study for a deposit return scheme for drinks containers in Scotland. It has yet to implement such a scheme.\n\nIn Scotland, some Barr products in 750 mL glass bottles, had a 30p container deposit although this was discontinued in August 2015. Some Tesco stores have reverse vending machines which pay ½p per aluminium can (equivalent value in Tesco Clubcard Points). Furthermore, the landmark Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 passed by the Scottish Parliament contains within it powers for Scottish ministers to implement a national scheme. As of April 2017, a Holyrood motion supporting the idea of a small deposit on all drinks containers was signed by 66 MSPs, including member from every party. In May 2015, the Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland (APRS) published Scottish polling which revealed overwhelming support for deposit-return. The figures showed that 78.8% of those who expressed a view supported this approach for Scotland, while just 8.5% opposed it. Several companies, most notably large drinks corporations like Coca-Cola, are known to have lobbied against the introduction of a national deposit scheme. Leaked documents reveal that in Europe, Coca Cola had identified deposit programs as a threat and they were planning to fight back. But in February 2017, the drinks company unexpectedly announced its support for a deposit-return program in Scotland, and in a statement to the Independent, Coca-Cola UK stated: \"We have embarked on a major review of our sustainable packaging strategy to understand what role we can play in unlocking the full potential of a circular economy in Great Britain.\" On September 5, 2017, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced that a deposit-system would be implemented as a means to tackle the rising tide of waste. No date has been set for implementation at this time. In the days of refillable milk bottles, such bottles were deposit-free.\n\nAs of March 2018, Welsh ministers are working on a plan to introduce a deposit return scheme.\n\nThe United States container-deposit laws are popularly called \"bottle bills\" after the Oregon Bottle Bill, which was the first U.S. state to pass container deposit legislation in 1971.\n\nEfforts to pass container deposit legislation in the 39 states that do not have them are often politically contentious. The U.S. beverage container industry—including both the bottlers of water, soda, beer, and the corporate owners of grocery stores and convenience stores—often spends large amounts of money lobbying against the introduction of both new and amended beverage container deposit legislation. Because of this, a new bottle bill has not been passed since 2005, and Delaware repealed its law in 2010 in favour of a non-refundable USD $0.04 tax per beverage container sold (Universal Recycling Law). Delaware's bottle bill was introduced in 1982 and had charged a $0.05 deposit on all beverage container (except aluminum) under 2 quarts. \n\nThere are currently 10 states that have container deposit laws: \n\nStates that formerly have can deposit regulation:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3427888", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3427888", "title": "Corporate liability", "text": "Corporate liability\n\nIn criminal law, corporate liability determines the extent to which a corporation as a legal person can be liable for the acts and omissions of the natural persons it employs. It is sometimes regarded as an aspect of criminal vicarious liability, as distinct from the situation in which the wording of a statutory offence specifically attaches liability to the corporation as the principal or joint principal with a human agent.\n\nThe imposition of criminal liability is only one means of regulating corporations. There are also civil law remedies such as injunction and the award of damages which may include a penal element. Generally, criminal sanctions include imprisonment, fines and community service orders. A company has no physical existence, so it can only act vicariously through the agency of the human beings it employs. While it is relatively uncontroversial that human beings may commit crimes for which punishment is a just desert, the extent to which the corporation should incur liability is less clear. Obviously, a company cannot be sent to jail, and if a fine is to be paid, this diminishes both the money available to pay the wages and salaries of all the remaining employees, and the profits available to pay all the existing shareholders. Thus, the effect of the only available punishment is deflected from the wrongdoer personally and distributed among all the innocent parties who supply the labour and the capital that keep the corporation solvent.\n\nBecause, at a public policy level, the growth and prosperity of society depends on the business community, governments recognise limits on the extent to which each permitted form of business entity can be held liable (including general and limited partnerships which may also have separate legal personalities). However, limitations on corporate liability can lead to profound injustices for individuals resulting from a limited ability to be properly compensated for wrongdoing.\n\n\n\nMost jurisdictions use criminal and civil systems in parallel, making the political judgment on how infrequently to use the criminal law to maximise the publicity of those cases that are prosecuted. While others enact specific legislation covering health and safety, and product safety issues which lay down general protections for the public and for the employees. The difficulty of proving a \"mens rea\" is avoided in the less serious offences by imposing absolute, strict liability, or vicarious liability which does not require proof that the accused knew or could reasonably have known that its act was wrong, and which does not recognise any excuse of honest and reasonable mistake. But, most legislatures require some element of fault, either by way of an intention to commit the offence or recklessness resulting in the offence, or some knowledge of the relevant circumstances. Thus, companies are held liable when the acts and omissions, and the knowledge of the employees can be attributed to the corporation. This is usually filtered through an \"identification\", \"directing mind\" or \"alter ego\" test which proves that the employee has sufficient status to be considered the company when acting.\n\nIn \"Tesco Supermarkets Ltd v Nattrass\" [1972] AC 153, Lord Reid said:\n\nThis approach has been criticised because it restricts corporate liability to the acts of directors and a few high-level managers. This unfairly favours larger corporations because they will escape criminal liability for the acts of all the employees who manage the day-to-day activities of the corporations. This has proved problematic as in the cases involving corporate manslaughter.\n\nBy “aggregating” the acts and omissions of two or more natural persons acting as the corporation, the \"actus reus\" and \"mens rea\" can be constructed out of the conduct and knowledge of several individuals. This is termed the \"Doctrine of Collective Knowledge\". In \"United States v Bank of New England\" (1987) 821 F2d 844 the charge of wilfully failing to file reports relating to currency transactions was proved because the bank’s knowledge was the totality of what all of the employees knew within the scope of their authority. The Court of Appeals’ confirmed a collective knowledge is appropriate because corporations would compartmentalise knowledge and subdivide duties and avoid liability. Aggregation has been applied in Australian courts, but is rejected in England.\n\nGobert argues that if a corporation fails to take precautions or to show due diligence to avoid committing a criminal offence, this will arise from its culture where attitudes and beliefs are demonstrated through its structures, policies, practices, and procedures. This rejects the notion that corporations should be treated in the same way as natural persons (i.e. looking for a \"guilty\" mind), and advocates that different legal concepts should underpin the liability of fictitious persons. This reflects the structures of modern corporations which are more often decentralised and where crime is less to do with the misconduct by or incompetence of individuals, and more to do with systems that fail to address problems of monitoring and controlling risk.\n\nA benefit test has been applied in the Federal Court of Australia, the House of Lords (now the Supreme Court of England) and the Supreme Court of Canada. Put simply, the test proposes that where a company gains the benefit of an act, it is considered to be attributed with that act. The test is applied differently when an act is performed by a \"mind and will\", which usually prompts the use of the organic theory, as opposed to an agent which usually prompts the use of the agency theory.\n\nIn some instances of fraud, the court may pierce the veil of incorporation. Most fraud is also a breach of the criminal law and any evidence obtained for the purposes of a criminal trial is usually admissible in civil proceedings. But criminal prosecutions take priority, so if civil proceedings uncover evidence of criminality, the civil action may be stayed pending the outcome of any criminal investigation.\n\nSome crimes are considered inchoate because, like a conspiracy or attempt, they anticipate the commission of the \"actus reus\" (the Latin for \"guilty act\") of the full offence. One option for prosecution would be to treat a corporation as an accomplice or co-conspirator with the employees. In general terms, most states permit companies to incur liability for such offences in the same way as natural persons so long as there are at least two natural persons involved in the conspiracy and one other accomplice to aid the commission of the offence by a principal.\n\n"}

A council may function as a legislature, especially at a town, city or county/shire level, but most legislative bodies at the state or national level are not considered councils. At such levels, there may be no separate executive branch, and the council may effectively represent the entire government. A board of directors might also be denoted as a council. A committee might also be denoted as a council, though a committee is generally a subordinate body composed of members of a larger body, while a council may not be. Because many schools have a student council, the council is the form of governance with which many people are likely to have their first experience as electors or participants.\n\nA member of a council may be referred to as a councillor or councilperson, or by the gender-specific titles of councilman and councilwoman.\n\nNotable examples of types of councils encountered in politics include:\n\n\nTypes of councils encountered in other spheres include:\n\n"}
{"id": "342014", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=342014", "title": "Demurrer", "text": "Demurrer\n\nA demurrer is a pleading in a lawsuit that objects to or challenges a pleading filed by an opposing party. The word \"demur\" means \"to object\"; a \"demurrer\" is the document that makes the objection. Lawyers informally define a demurrer as a defendant saying \"So what?\" to the pleading.\n\nTypically, the defendant in a case will demur to the complaint, but it is also possible for the plaintiff to demur to an answer. The demurrer challenges the legal sufficiency of a cause of action in a complaint or of an affirmative defense in an answer. If a cause of action in a complaint does not state a cognizable claim (e.g., the claim is nonsense) or if it does not state all the required elements, then the challenged cause of action or possibly the entire complaint can be thrown out (informally speaking) at the demurrer stage as not legally sufficient. A demurrer is typically filed near the beginning of a case in response to the plaintiff filing a complaint or the defendant answering the complaint.\n\nIn common law, a demurrer was the pleading through which a defendant challenged the legal sufficiency of a complaint in criminal or civil cases. Today, however, the pleading has been discontinued in many jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, the U.S. federal court system, and most U.S. states (though some states, including California, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, retain it). In criminal cases, a demurrer was considered a common law due process right, to be heard and decided before the defendant was required to plead \"not guilty,\" or make any other pleading in response, without having to admit or deny any of the facts alleged.\n\nA demurrer generally \"assumes\" the truth of all material facts alleged in the complaint and the defendant cannot present evidence to the contrary, even if those facts appear to be obvious fabrications by the plaintiff or are likely to be easily disproved during litigation. That is, the point of the demurrer is to test whether a cause of action or affirmative defense \"as pleaded\" is legally insufficient, even if all facts pleaded are assumed to be true. \n\nThe sole exception to the no-evidence rule is that a court may take judicial notice of certain things. For example, the court can take judicial notice of commonly known facts not reasonably subject to challenge, such as the Gregorian calendar, or of public records, such as a published legislative report showing the intent of the legislature in enacting a particular statute.\n\nA demurrer is commonly filed by a defendant in response to a complaint filed by the plaintiff. A demurrer to a complaint can terminate a lawsuit. Although a plaintiff may demur to a defendant's answer to a complaint or the defendant's affirmative defenses, a demurrer to an answer is less common because it may be a poor strategic move. A demurrer to an answer may simplify a lawsuit, but it usually will not end the lawsuit; it is normally used only when the plaintiff intends to move for summary judgment in their favor at the earliest opportunity and needs to preemptively attack some of the defendant's affirmative defenses. \n\nTechnically, a demurrer is not a \"motion;\" a party does not file a \"motion for demurrer\" nor \"move the court to demur.\" Rather, a demurrer is a particular type of pleading and demurring is the act by which a party formally requests the court to dismiss a cause of action (claim) or the entire complaint. \n\nIn lay terms, a judge who sustains a demurrer is saying that the law does not recognize a legal claim for the facts stated by the complaining party. If the judge overrules a demurrer, the court is allowing the claim or case to proceed. \n\nIn legal terms, the demurring party asserts that the complaint or counterclaim does not amount to a legally valid claim, even if the factual allegations contained in the complaint or counterclaim are accepted as true. \n\nUsually, a demurrer attacks a complaint as missing one or more required elements of a claim. Those elements are usually attacked by showing that the plaintiff failed to plead an essential element \"per se\" or facts that adequately support it (e.g., facts giving rise to an actionable duty running from the defendant to the plaintiff). Another method is to attack the entire cause of action itself as abolished or prohibited as against public policy (e.g., wrongful life is against public policy in most jurisdictions). \n\nDemurrers are decided by a judge rather than a jury. The judge either grants the demurrer by sustaining it, or denies it by overruling the demurrer. If the demurrer is overruled, the defendant is ordered to file an answer within a certain period of time or else risk a default judgment. Once the answer is filed, then the case is said to be \"at issue\" (because there are now a complaint and answer on file opposing each other with the parties' respective provisions), and the case proceeds to the discovery stage. \n\nIn the alternative, a judge may sustain a demurrer with prejudice or without prejudice. With prejudice means the plaintiff cannot file another complaint attempting to fix insufficiencies of the previous complaint. If the demurrer is granted without prejudice and/or with leave to amend, then the plaintiff may correct errors filing a corrected and/or amended complaint. Demurrers sustained with prejudice are reserved for when the judge determines a plaintiff cannot cure or fix the complaint by rewriting or amending it. Depending upon the severity of the defect in a complaint, a court may sustain with prejudice on the first demurrer (very rare) or allow the plaintiff as many as three or four attempts before sustaining a demurrer to a third or fourth amended complaint with prejudice.\n\nIn criminal cases, a demurrer may be used in some circumstances to challenge the legal sufficiency of the indictment or other similar charging instrument. Traditionally, if the defendant could admit every allegation of the indictment and still be innocent of any crime, then a \"general demurrer\" would be sustained and the indictment would be dismissed. A \"special demurrer\" refers to an attack on the form, rather than the substance, of the charge: if the defendant correctly identifies some defect \"on the face\" of the indictment, then the charges are subject to being dismissed, although usually the indictment can be redrawn (rewritten) and re-presented to the grand jury or other charging authority. While there are different ways to accomplish the goals of a special demurrer, often an alternative method to challenge the sufficiency of the indictment is an attack on the prosecution's case prior to trial, and is generally made by means of motion to dismiss.\n\nIn civil law a demurrer as such is no longer available under the current law of England and Wales. However, two similar procedures may be employed where claims without merit need to be expeditiously dismissed.\n\nFirst, an \"application on notice\" can be made for summary judgment in favor of the objecting party. Second, the court has power to strike out the Particulars of Claim.\n\nTo have a non-meritorious claim dismissed, however, the distinction between the two procedures is that when the Particulars of Claim are struck out, the claimant usually has another opportunity to file an amended Particulars of Claim, within, for example, four weeks, whereas Summary Judgment is final, though subject to appeal.\n\nIn criminal law demurrer is obsolete, although not formally abolished. It has been superseded by the more modern \"motion to quash\", usually a verbal application to the judge to rule the indictment null and void and to stop the case. (Demurrer was pleaded in writing).\n\nIn civil cases in the United States district courts, the demurrer was expressly abolished by Rule 7(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (\"FRCP\", also \"Federal Rules\") when the FRCP went into effect on September 16, 1938. The demurrer was replaced by the Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. \n\nThe demurrer was abolished after American lawyers realized that the pleadings should frame only those issues that will be actively litigated through motion practice once both sides have fully stated their positions and the case is at issue. Although the demurrer technically also framed the issues in a case, treating the demurrer as a pleading came to be seen as irrational because it was the \"only\" pleading that required an immediate hearing and ruling on its content (which consisted of an attack upon the complaint), while the complaint and the answer merely stated the respective positions of each side but did not require hearings in and of themselves. Thus, it made sense that a discretionary attack upon the complaint that was already being drafted, calendared, heard, and ruled upon like a motion should simply be treated like one.\n\nHaving purged the demurrer from federal courts, Rule 7(c) was deemed obsolete by the Advisory Committee on Civil Rules during the 2002–2007 FRCP revision cycle. It was therefore deleted from the version of the FRCP that went into effect on December 1, 2007.\n\nA majority of U.S. states (approximately 35) have adopted civil procedure rules modeled after the Federal Rules and therefore have abolished the demurrer and replaced it with the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. In Ohio, for example, demurrers are specifically prohibited.\n\nHowever, a demurrer can still be filed by the defendant in a minority of U.S. state court systems. Demurrers are still used in California and Virginia state court civil practice. In California, a demurrer must assume the truth of the facts alleged by the complaining party, but challenges the complaint as a matter of law. If a demurrer is sustained regarding the form of the complaint, leave to amend is liberally granted, and denial of leave to amend may constitute an abuse of discretion. Additionally, when children are removed from their parents and taken into foster care in California, the parents may challenge the sufficiency of the dependency complaint by means of a \"motion akin to demurrer\", which operates similarly to a demurrer. However, demurrers are prohibited in California in other family law actions. Also in California, a demurrer is not said to be \"granted,\" but is said to be \"sustained\" or \"overruled.\" An order sustaining a demurrer is not a readily appealable order unless it disposes of an entire action without leave to amend and results in a judgment. \n\nThe term \"preliminary objection\" is used in Pennsylvania state court to refer to all motions made after the filing of a complaint but before the filing of an answer; preliminary objections may be made \"in the nature of a demurrer\" (seeking to dismiss a cause of action for legal insufficiency) or \"in the nature of a motion to strike\" (seeking to remove parts of a pleading for failure to abide by the technical rules), as well as various other means. As with the traditional demurrer, preliminary objections are regarded as pleadings. Preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer are governed by Rule 1028(a)(4) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure.\n"}

{"id": "305835", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=305835", "title": "Dog fighting", "text": "Dog fighting\n\nDog fighting is a type of blood sport generally defined as two or more game dogs against one another in a ring or a pit for the entertainment of the spectators or the gratification of the dogfighters, who are sometimes referred to as dogmen.\n\nIn rural areas, fights are often staged in barns or outdoor pits; in urban areas, fights may occur in garages, basements, warehouses, abandoned buildings, back alleys, neighborhood playgrounds, or in the streets. Dog fights usually last until one dog is declared a winner, which occurs when one dog fails to scratch, one dog dies, or one dog jumps out of the pit. Sometimes dog fights end without declaring a winner; for instance, the dog's owner may call the fight.\n\nDog fighting generates revenue from stud fees, admission fees and gambling. Worldwide, several countries have banned dog fighting, but it is still legal in some countries like Japan, Honduras, and parts of Russia.\n\nBlood sports in general can be traced back to the Roman Empire. In 13 BC, for instance, the ancient Roman circus slew 600 African beasts. Likewise, under Emperor Claudius's reign, as spectators cheered, 300 bears and 300 Libyan beasts were slain in the Colosseum. Dog fighting, more specifically, can also be traced to ancient Roman times. In 43 AD, for example, dogs fought alongside the Romans and the British in the Roman Conquest of Britain. In this war, the Romans used a breed that originated from Greece called Molossus; the Britons used broad-mouth Mastiffs, which were thought to descend from the Molossus bloodline and which also originated from Greece. Though the British were outnumbered and ultimately lost this war, the Romans were so impressed with the English Mastiffs that they began to import these dogs for use in the Colosseum, as well as for use in times of war. While spectators watched, the imported English Mastiffs were pitted against animals such as wild elephants, lions, bears, bulls, and gladiators.\n\nLater, the Romans bred and exported fighting dogs to Spain, France and other parts of Europe until eventually these dogs made their way back to England. Though bull baiting and bear baiting were popular throughout the Middle Ages up to the 19th century in Germany, France, Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands, the British pitted dogs against bulls and bears on a scale like no other. In 12th century England during the feudal era, the landed aristocracy, who held direct military control in decentralized feudal systems and thus owned the animals necessary for waging war, introduced bull baiting and bear baiting to the rest of the British population. In later years, bull baiting and bear baiting became a popular source of entertainment for the British royalty. For instance, Queen Elizabeth I, who reigned from 1558–1603, was an avid follower of bull and bear baiting; she bred Mastiffs for baiting and would entertain foreign guests with a fight whenever they visited England. In addition to breeding Mastiffs and entertaining foreign guests with a fight, Queen Elizabeth, and later her successor, King James I, built a number of bear gardens in London. The garden buildings were round and roofless, and housed not only bears, but also bulls and other wild animals that could be used in a fight. Today, a person can visit the Bear Garden museum near the Shakespeare Global Complex in Bankside, Southwark.\n\nWith the popularity of bull and bear baiting, bears needed for such fights soon became scarce. With the scarcity of bear population, the price of bears rose and, because of this, bull baiting became more common in England over time. Bulls who survived the fights were slaughtered afterwards for their meat, as it was believed that the fight caused bull meat to become more tender. In fact, if a bull was offered for sale in the market without having been baited the previous day, butchers were liable to face substantial fines. Animal fights were temporarily suspended in England when Oliver Cromwell seized power, but were reinstated again after the Restoration. Dog fighting, bear baiting, and bull baiting were officially outlawed in England by the Humane Act of 1835. The official ban on all fights, however, actually served to promote dog fighting in England. Since a small amount of space was required for the pit where a dog fight took place, as compared to the ring needed for bull or bear baiting, authorities had a difficult time enforcing the ban on dog fighting.\n\nIn 1817, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier was brought to America and dog fighting became part of American culture. Yet, though historical accounts of dog fighting in America can be dated back to the 1750s, it was not until the end of the Civil War (1861–1865) that widespread interest and participation in the blood sport began in the United States. For instance, in 1881, the Mississippi and Ohio railroads advertised special fares to a dog fight in Louisville; public forums such as Kit Burns' Tavern, \"The Sportman's Hall,\" in Manhattan regularly hosted matches. Many of these dogs thrown into the \"professional pits\" that flourished during the 1860s came from England and Ireland—where citizens had turned to dogs when bear-baiting and bull-baiting became illegal in their countries.\n\nIn twentieth century America, despite the expansion of laws to outlaw dog fighting, dog fighting continued to flourish underground. Aiding in the expansion of dog fighting were the police and firemen, who saw dog fighting as a form of entertainment amongst their ranks. In fact, the Police Gazette served as a \"go to\" source for information about where one could attend a fight. When Henry Bergh, who started the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), witnessed police involvement in these fights, he was motivated to seek and receive authority for the ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement Agents to have arresting power in New York. Additionally, Bergh's 1867 revision to New York's animal cruelty law made all forms of animal fighting illegal. However, According to the ASPCA website, the Humane Law Enforcement department of ASPCA has been disbanded and NYPD has taken over its duty. As laws were passed to outlaw the activity, high-profile organizations, such as the United Kennel Club, who once endorsed the sport by formulating rules and sanctioning referees, withdrew their endorsement.\n\nOn July 8, 2009, the ASPCA also participated in one of the largest federal dog fighting raids in U.S. history. Most of the dogs rescued were pit bulls (over 400 of them). This raid took place in eight states and had 26 arrests, of which two defendants are required to spend at least 10 years in prison.\n\nAccording to one scholar, Richard Strebel, the foundation for modern fighting dogs came from: 1. The Tibetan Mastiff; 2. The English Mastiff, out of which came the French Mastiff, the English Bulldog, and the Pug; 3. The Great Dane, out of which came the Danish Mastiff and the Boxer; 4. The Newfoundland; and 5. The Saint Bernard, out of which came the Leonberger. However, Dieter Fleig disagreed with Strebel and offered the following list as composing of the foundation for modern fighting dogs: 1. The Tibetan Mastiff; 2. The Molossus; 3. The Bull Biter; 4. The Great Dane; 5. The English Mastiff; 6. The Bulldog; 5. The Bull and Terrier; and 6. The Chincha Bulldog.\n\nThe foundation breed of the fighting dog was, in its outward appearance, a large, low, heavy breed with a powerful build and strongly developed head, and tremendously threatening voice. Additionally, these foundation breeds were also bred for a powerful jaw that would enable them to defend and protect humans, to overpower and pull down large animals on a hunt, and to control large, unmanageable domestic animals. These dogs were also sometimes equipped with metal plates, chains, and collars with sharp spikes or hooked knives in order to be used in wars throughout history.\n\nWhen bullbaiting became popular in England due to the shortage of bears, bull baiters soon realized that large fighting dogs were built too heavy and too slow for this type of combat. When fighting a bull, dogs were trained to grab onto the bull's nose and pin the bull's head to the ground. If the dog failed to do this, the bull would fling the dog out of the ring with its horns. The British therefore decided to selectively breed fighting dogs for shorter legs and a more powerful jaw. These efforts resulted in the Old English Bulldog.\n\nHowever, when countries started outlawing bull and bear baiting, dog fighters started pitting dogs against other dogs. With the prevalence of such combat, dogfighters soon realized bulldogs were inadequate and began to breed bulldogs with terriers for more desired characteristics. Terriers were most likely crossbred with bulldogs due to their \"generally rugged body structure,\" speed, aggression, and \"highly developed gameness.\" Yet, there is a debate over which type of terrier was bred with bulldogs in order to create the Bull and Terrier. For instance, Joseph L. Colby claimed that it was the old English White Terrier that the Bull and Terrier is descended from, while Rhonda D. Evans and Craig J. Forsyth contend that its ancestor is the Rat Terrier. Carl Semencic, on the other hand, held that a variety of terriers produced the Bull and Terrier.\n\nEventually, out of cross breeding bulldogs and terriers, the English created the Staffordshire Bull Terrier. When the Staffordshire Bull Terrier came to America in 1817, Americans began to selectively breed for gameness and created the American Pit Bull Terrier (originally known as the Pit Bull Terrier), which is a unique breed due to its absence of threat displays when fighting and its docility towards humans. Staffordshire Bull Terriers, American Pit Bull Terriers, American Staffordshire Terriers, and Bull Terriers are all breeds that are commonly labeled as pit bulls. The fact that \"pit bulls\" were historically bred to fight bulls and bears has been used as justifications in some U.S. cities to implement Breed Specific Legislation.\n\nAfter interviewing 31 dogmen and attending 14 dog fights in the Southern United States, Evans, Gauthier, and Forsyth theorized on what attracts men to dog fights. In their study, Evans, et al., discussed dog fighting's attractiveness in terms of masculinity and class immobility. In the United States, masculinity embodies the qualities of strength, aggression, competition, and striving for success. By embodying these characteristics, a man can gain honor and status in his society. Yet, working class occupations, unlike middle or upper class occupations, provide limited opportunities to validate this culturally accepted definition of masculinity. So, working class men look for alternative ways to validate their masculinity and obtain honor and status. One way to do this is through dogfighting. This is supported by the Evans, et al. findings: the majority of committed dogmen were mostly drawn from the working class, while the middle and upper classes were barely represented. Men from middle and upper classes have opportunities to express their masculinity through their occupations; dog fighting, therefore, is just a hobby for them while it plays a central role in the lives of working class men. Those from the higher classes are drawn in by the thrill and excitement of the fight.\n\nAside from enjoyment of the sport and status, people are also drawn to dog fighting for money. In fact, the average dog fight could easily net more money than an armed robbery, or a series of isolated drug transactions.\n\n\"Bait\" animals are animals used to test a dog's fighting instinct; they are often mauled or killed in the process. Many of the training methods involve torturing and killing of other animals. Often \"bait\" animals are stolen pets, puppies, kittens, rabbits, small dogs and even stock (pit bulls acquired by the dogfighting ring which appear to be passive or less dominant). Other sources for bait animals include wild or feral animals, animals obtained from a shelter, or animals obtained from \"free to good home\" ads. The snouts of bait animals are often wrapped with duct tape to prevent them from fighting back and they are used in training sessions to improve a dog's endurance, strength or fighting ability. A bait animal's teeth may also be broken to prevent them from fighting back. If the bait animals are still alive after the training sessions, they are usually given to the dogs as a reward, and the dogs finish killing them.\n\nOften associated with gang activity, street fighters fight dogs over insults, turf invasions, or simple taunts like \"my dog can kill your dog.\" These type of fights are often spontaneous; unorganized; conducted for money, drugs, or bragging rights; and occur on street corners, back alleys, and neighborhood playgrounds. Urban street fighters generally have several dogs chained in backyards, often behind privacy fences, or in basements or garages. After a street fight, the dogs are often discovered by police and animal control officers either dead or dying. Due to the spontaneity of a street fight, they are very difficult to respond to unless reported immediately.\n\nHobbyists and professionals often decry the techniques street fighters use to train their dogs. Such techniques include starving, drugging, and physically abusing the dog.\n\nHobbyists fight dogs for supplemental income and entertainment purposes. They typically have one or more dogs participating in several organized fights and operate primarily within a specific geographic network. Hobbyists are also acquainted with one another and tend to return to predetermined fight venues repeatedly.\n\nProfessional fighters breed generations of skilled \"game dogs\" and take a great pride in their dogs' lineage. These fighters make a tremendous amount of money charging stud fees to breed their champions, in addition to the fees and winnings they collect for fighting them. They also tend to own a large number of dogs—sometimes 50 or more. Professionals also use trade journals, such as Your Friend and Mine, Game Dog Times, The American Warrior, and The Pit Bull Chronicle, to discuss recent fights and to advertise the sale of training equipment and puppies. Some fighters operate on a national or even international level within highly secret networks. When a dog is not successful in a fight, a professional may dispose of it using a variety of techniques such as drowning, strangulation, hanging, gunshot, electrocution or some other method. Sometimes professionals and hobbyists dispose of dogs deemed aggressive to humans to street fighters.\n\nDog fighting is a felony in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. While dog fighting statutes exist independently of general anti-cruelty statutes and carry stiffer penalties than general state anti-cruelty statutes, a person can be charged under both or can be charged under one, but not the other—depending on the evidence. In addition to felony charges for dog fighting, forty-eight states and the District of Columbia, have provisions within their dogfighting statutes that explicitly prohibit attendance as a spectator at a dogfighting exhibition. Since Montana and Hawaii do not have such provisions, a person can pay an entrance fee to watch a dog-fight in either state and not be convicted under these statutes. Additionally, forty-six states, and the District of Columbia, make possessing, owning or keeping a fighting dog a felony.\n\nWhile dog fighting was previously seen as isolated animal welfare issues—and therefore rarely enforced, the last decade has produced a growing body of legal and empirical evidence that has revealed a connection between dog-fighting and other crimes within a community, such as organized crime, racketeering, drug distribution, and/or gangs. Within the gang community, fighting dogs compete with firearms as the weapon of choice; indeed, their versatile utility arguably surpasses that of a loaded firearm in the criminal underground. Drug dealers distribute their illicit merchandise, wagers are made, weapons are concealed, and the dogs mutilate each other in a bloody frenzy as crowds cheer on. Violence often erupts among the usually armed gamblers when debts are to be collected and paid. There is also a concern for children who are routinely exposed to dogfighting and are forced to accept the inherent violence as normal. The routine exposure of the children to unfettered animal abuse and neglect is a major contributing factor in their later manifestation of social deviance.\n\nAnimal advocates consider dog fighting to be one of the most serious forms of animal abuse, not only for the violence that the dogs endure during and after the fights, but because of the suffering they often endure in training.\n\nAccording to a filing in U.S. District Court in Richmond by federal investigators in Virginia, which was obtained under the Freedom of Information Act and published by \"the Baltimore Sun\" on July 6, 2007, a losing dog or one whose potential is considered unacceptable faces \"being put to death by drowning, strangulation, hanging, gun shot, electrocution or some other method\".\nSome of the training of fighting dogs may entail the use of small animals (including kittens) as prey for the dogs.\n\nDog fighting has been popular in many countries throughout history and continues to be practiced both legally and illegally around the world.\n\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, dog fighting has increasingly become an unlawful activity in most of the world.\n\nDog fighting is illegal in Morocco, with dogs previously being imported from France on the black market.\n\nDog fighting has been declared illegal in the Republic of South Africa. However, it is still very popular in the underground world, with dog fighting being a highly syndicated and organized crime. The NSPCA (National Council of SPCAs) is the largest animal welfare organization in Africa, and has been the organization that has conducted the most raids and busts, of which the most recent was in 2013, where 18 people were arrested, and 14 dogs were involved. Dog fighting is mostly practiced in the Western Cape, in the townships area where gangs and drugs are mostly associated with dog fighting.\n\nDog fighting has been documented in South Africa, particularly in the Western Cape region of Stellenbosch. The Stellenbosch Animal Welfare Society (AWS) frequently responds to complaints of night-time dog fighting in the town of Cloetesville in which hundreds of dogs fight. Young children may be used to transport fighting dogs to avoid arrest of the owners.\n\nPreviously banned by the Taliban, dog fighting has made a resurgence throughout Afghanistan as a winter weekend pastime.\n\nIn Kabul, the fights are public and policed for safety to the spectators. Dogs are not fought to the death, but to submission. Top dogs are worth as much as a new car.\n\nDog fighting is allowed under Chinese law, although gambling remains illegal.\n\nDog fighting is not common, but can be found in some Indian states such as Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and in some parts of Delhi. The practice is illegal as defined by Indian law.\n\nAccording to historical documents, Hōjō Takatoki, the 14th shikken (\"shōgun\"s regent) of the Kamakura shogunate was known to be obsessed with dog fighting, to the point where he allowed his samurai to pay taxes with dogs. During this period dog fighting was known as .\n\nDog fighting was considered a way for the Samurai to retain their aggressive edge during peaceful times. Several \"daimyōs\" (feudal lords), such as Chōsokabe Motochika and Yamauchi Yōdō, both from Tosa Province (present-day Kōchi Prefecture), were known to encourage dog fighting. Dog fighting was also popular in Akita Prefecture, which is the origin of the Akita breed.\n\nDog fighting evolved in Kōchi to a form that is called . Under modern rules, dogs fight in a fenced ring until one of the dogs barks, yelps, or loses the will to fight. Owners are allowed to throw in the towel, and matches are stopped if a doctor judges if is too dangerous. Draws usually occur when both dogs will not fight or both dogs fight until the time limit. There are various other rules, including one that specifies that a dog will lose if it attempts to copulate. Champion dogs are called yokozuna, as in sumo. Dog fighting is not banned at a nationwide level, but the prefectures of Tokyo, Kanagawa, Fukui, Ishikawa, Toyama and Hokkaidō all ban the practice. Currently, most fighting dogs in Japan are of the Tosa breed which is native to Kōchi.\n\nDog fighting and other forms of animal fighting are extremely popular in all parts of rural Pakistan, and is deeply rooted in the rural culture, where some 70 percent of the population resides. It has been a way for tribes, clans and the rural people to socialize while being entertained.\nEven though it has recently been banned by law, it is still being practiced in rural Pakistan, especially in provinces such as Punjab, Azad Kashmir, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa. Now Karachi.Sindhi is the most popular city about Pitbull fighting with the proper rules There can apparently be as much as millions of rupees at stake for the owners of winning dogs, so different breeds have carefully been bred and selected specifically for the purpose, such as the Bully Kutta.\n\nDog fighting is illegal in the Philippines, with those involved being convicted under animal cruelty laws.\n\nDog fighting and the possession of any fighting equipment designed for dog fighting is illegal in all Australian states and territories. The illegal nature of dogfighting in Australia means that injured dogs rarely get veterinary treatment placing the dog's health and welfare at even greater risk. \"Restricted Breed Dogs\" cannot be imported into Australia. These include the Dogo Argentino, the Japanese Tosa, the Fila Brasileiro, the Perro de Presa Canario and the American Pit Bull Terrier. Of these, the Pit Bull Terrier and the Perro de Presa Canario are the only breeds currently known to exist in Australia and there are strict regulations on keeping these breeds, including a prohibition on transferring ownership.\n\nDog fighting has been illegal in Ireland for over 150 years, although the sport is still popular in underground circles.\n\nAlthough animal cruelty laws exist in Russia, dog fighting is widely practiced. Laws prohibiting dogfights have been passed in certain places like Moscow by order of that city's mayor. In much of Russia dogfights are legally held generally using Caucasian Shepherd Dog, Georgian shepherd, Central Asian Shepherd Dog. Temperament tests, which are a common and relatively mild form of dog fighting used for breeding purposes, are fairly commonplace. Most dog fights are traditional contests used to test the stamina and ability of working dogs used to protect livestock. Unlike fights with pit bulls and other fighting breeds, a veterinarian is always on hand and the contests are never to the death, and serious injuries are very rare. Most fights are over in minutes when its clear which dog is superior. At the end of three rounds the contest is declared a draw.\n\nDog fighting remains illegal under UK law. Despite periodic dog-fight prosecutions, however, illegal canine pit battles continued after the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835 of England and Wales. The Protection of Animals Act 1911 was specific in outlawing \"the fighting or baiting of animals\", however the sport remains popular in underground circles. \n\nSporting journals of the 18th and 19th centuries depict the Black Country and London as the primary English dog fight centres of the period.\n\nIn accordance with the Animal Welfare Act 1999, dog fighting is illegal within New Zealand. Breeding, training or owning dogs for fighting is also illegal.\n\nDog fighting has been illegal in Canada since 1892; however, the current law requires police to catch individuals during the unlawful act, which is often difficult.\n\nDog fighting is a felony in all 50 U.S. states as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. In most of the United States a spectator at a dog fight can be charged with a felony while some areas only consider it a misdemeanor offense.\n\nIn addition, the federal U.S. Animal Welfare Act makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly sell, buy, possess, train, transport, deliver, or receive any dog for purposes of having the dog participate in an animal fighting venture. The act also makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly use the mail service of the United States Postal Service or any instrumentality of interstate commerce for commercial speech for purposes of advertising a dog for use in an animal fighting venture, promoting or in any other manner furthering an animal fighting venture except as performed outside the limits of the States of the United States.\n\nIn the second largest dog fighting raid in U.S. history in August 2013, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama handed down the longest prison term ever handed down in a federal dog fighting case: eight years.\n\nAccording to a study by the College of Law of Michigan State University published in 2005, in the United States, dog fighting was once completely legal and was sanctioned and promoted during the colonial period through the Victorian and well into the 20th century. In the second half 19th century dog fighting started to be criminalized in the United States.\n\nThere is a US$5,000 reward for reporting dog fighting to The Humane Society of the United States From the HSUS: How to spot signs of dogfighting in your community: An inordinate number of pit bull-type dogs being kept in one location, especially multiple dogs who are chained and seem unsocialized; Dogs with scars on their faces, front legs, and stifle area (hind end and thighs); Dogfighting training equipment such as \"breaking sticks\" or \"break sticks\" used to pry apart the jaws of dogs locked in battle which are foot long, flat on one side, appearing to be sharpened; tires or \"spring poles\" (usually a large spring with rope attached to either end) hanging from tree limbs; or unusual foot traffic coming and going from a location at odd hours.\n\nCNN estimated that in the United States more than 100,000 people are engaged in dog fighting on a non-professional basis and roughly 40,000 individuals are involved as professionals in the sport of dog fighting as a commercial activity. Top fights are said to have purses of $100,000 or more.\n\nIn Costa Rica, dogfights were illegal for decades as a misdemeanor, since 2014 and after a legal reform became a felony and is punished with up to three years of imprisonment.\n\nDog fighting is illegal in much of South America. The American Pit Bull Terrier is by far the most common breed involved in the bloodsport. The Dogo Argentino was also used as fighting dog. The Dogo Cubano and Cordoba Fighting Dog were used for fighting a century ago, but have become extinct.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8987574", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8987574", "title": "Equity-indexed annuity", "text": "Equity-indexed annuity\n\nAn indexed annuity (the word \"equity\" previously tied to indexed annuities has been removed to help prevent the assumption of stock market investing being present in these products) in the United States is a type of tax-deferred annuity whose credited interest is linked to an equity index — typically the S&P 500 or international index. It guarantees a minimum interest rate (typically between 1% and 3%) if held to the end of the surrender term and protects against a loss of principal. An equity index annuity is a contract with an insurance or annuity company. The returns may be higher than fixed instruments such as CDs, money market accounts, and bonds but not as high as market returns. Equity Index Annuities are insured by each State's Guarantee Fund; coverage is not as strong as the insurance provided by the FDIC. For example, in California the fund will cover \"80% not to exceed $250,000.\" The guarantees in the contract are backed by the relative strength of the insurer. \n\nThe contracts may be suitable for a portion of the asset portfolio for those who want to avoid risk and are in retirement or nearing retirement age. The objective of purchasing an equity index annuity is to realize greater gains than those provided by CDs, money markets or bonds, while still protecting principal. The long term ability of Equity Index Annuities to beat the returns of other fixed instruments is a matter of debate.\n\nIndexed annuities represent about 30% of all fixed annuity sales in 2006 according to the Advantage Group.\n\nEquity-indexed annuities may also be referred to as fixed indexed annuities or simple indexed annuities. The mechanics of equity-indexed annuities are often complex and the returns can vary greatly depending on the month and year the annuity is purchased. Like many other types of annuities, equity-indexed annuities usually carry a surrender charge for early withdrawal. These \"surrender periods\" range between 3 and 16 years; typically, about ten.\n\nSee Indexed annuity\n\nThe indexed annuity is virtually identical to a fixed annuity except in the way interest is calculated. As an example, consider a $100,000 fixed annuity that credits a 4% annual effective interest rate. The owner receives an interest credit of $4,000. However, in an equity-indexed annuity, the interest credit is linked to the equity markets. For example: Assume the index is the S&P 500, a one-year point-to-point method is used, and the annuity has an 8% cap. The $100,000 annuity could credit anything between 0% and 8% based on the change in the S&P 500. The cap, 8% in this example, is determined by how much is afforded by budget which is usually at or near the 4% fixed rate. If fixed rates increase, it would be expected that the cap would increase as well.\n\nThis allows the owner the security of knowing that the $100,000 is safe but rather than receiving the sure 4% they can receive up to 8%. Historically since 1950, an 8% cap on the S&P 500 has resulted in an average interest credit of 5.2%, very similar to what is considered the \"risk free rate of return\" delivered by T-bills, 5.1% over a similar period. The return may also be adjusted by other factors such as the participation rate and market value adjustments to cover bring the cost of the option into the budget available. \n\nThis means the owner of the indexed annuity now has assumed more risk than a fixed annuity but less than being in the equity markets themselves. The result is that the expected yield (risk adjusted) for an indexed annuity is higher than a fixed annuity, CD, etc. However, the expected yield of being in the market is higher for several reasons. \n\nThe principal (in our example the $100,000) is at risk of loss when owning the index outright. Equity Index Annuity does not participate in dividends as owning the index outright would and similar there are no ongoing transaction expenses or fees. Interest is compounded as frequently as when interest is credited and this is almost always annually but contracts are available that credit interest over a 5-year term.\n\nThe taxation of the gains in an indexed annuity is identical to that of fixed annuities. Taxes are deferred until monies are received and then interest is withdrawn first and taxed as ordinary income. If the index was owned outright, gains would not be tax deferred, but may qualify for the more favorable capital gains tax rate.\n\nThis way of linking to an equity index like the S&P 500 or Dow Jones is accomplished through an option, usually a call option. A call option is the right- but not the obligation- to purchase something at a future date for a specified price.\n\nThe naming convention for options used by the insurance industry is different from that of Wall Street, but the options are structurally identical. Here's a sample of options commonly seen in indexed annuities:\n\n\nThe options in indexed annuities can usually be fit into the following taxonomy developed by the National Association of Fixed Annuities.\n\n\"Term\" - the length of time before option matures, usually one year. Two, three, four, and ten are also prevalent in the market. Some longer term options are but have a \"highwater\" feature that allows interest to be credited more frequently. An example of this would be a ten-year Monthly Average option that credits interest each year if there is a gain.\n\n\"Index\" - the equity, stock, bond, or other index to which the interest credit is linked.\n\n\"Gain formula\" - the method used to determine the gain in the index. Point to point, monthly averaging, daily averaging are the most common methods of calculating the gain. For example, of the S&P 500 index starts at 1120 and ends at 1300 then the point to point gain is 16.07%.\n\n\"Adjustment method\" - the way the option is limited in order to reduce the cost (and subsequent return) so that it becomes affordable. As an example the point to point option may cost 7% of the account value but will be \"adjusted\" to reduce the cost.\n\n\"Market value adjustment\" - the company may reserve the right to adjust the value of your account based on current market conditions. This adjustment is most often applied to distributions, partial or complete withdrawals, and exchanges to other accounts. \n\nThe most common adjustments are cap, fee, participation rate or a combination of the three. Other adjustments are less common. In keeping with the preceding example and allowing for an 8% cap as the adjustment the policyholder would not receive the 16.07% point-to-point gain, but rather 8% as an interest credit.\n\nShould provide examples for:\nP2P with Participation Rate\nMonthly Averaging with Cap\nMonthly Averaging with Fee\n\nShould also link to the withdrawal benefits provided in variable annuities and indexed annuities at this point. These concepts were added because of the risk associated with the accumulation in both variable annuities and indexed annuities.\n\nWhile the taxes on gains are deferred, earnings are taxed at an individual's ordinary income tax rate as opposed to capital gains and qualified stock dividends which are tax at lower capital gains rates.

It took the form of a religious oath made by the accused prior to questioning by the Star Chamber, to answer truthfully all questions that might be asked. It gave rise to what became known as the cruel trilemma where the accused would find themselves trapped between a breach of religious oath (taken extremely seriously in that era, a mortal sin, and perjury), contempt of court for silence, or self-incrimination. The name derives from the questioner putting the accused on oath \"ex officio\", meaning by virtue of his office or position.\n\nOutcry against this practice (particularly in the trials of John Lilburne (\"Freeborn John\") around 1630–1649) led to the establishment of the right to not incriminate oneself in common law. This was the direct precursor of similar rights in modern law, including the right to silence and non-self-incrimination in the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The right itself appears as item 16 in the Levellers \"Agreement of the Free People of England\" (1649) and first appeared in US law in the Massachusetts Body of Liberties and the Connecticut Code of the same era. The Star Chamber itself, as a judicial body, was abolished by Parliament as part of the Habeas Corpus Act 1640.\n\nEarly examples of a codified right appears in the Levellers manifesto \"Agreement of the Free People of England\" (published 1 May 1649): \"[I]t shall not be in the power of any Representative, to punish, or cause to be punished, any person or persons for refusing to answer questions against themselves in Criminall cases\".\n\nThe right first appeared in US law in the Massachusetts Body of Liberties and the Connecticut Code of the same era.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court summarized the events of the time as part of the historical background in the landmark case \"Miranda v.

Heard in the Supreme Court in 1976, the decision considered whether press statements by the Prime Minister Robert Muldoon had breached section 1 of the Bill of Rights 1688, \"That the pretended power of suspending of laws, or the execution of laws, by regal authority, without consent of Parliament, is illegal\".\n\nThe Third Labour Government had passed the New Zealand Superannuation Act 1974 requiring employees and employers to make matching compulsory contributions to a superannuation fund from 1 April 1975. This was to be administered by the Superannuation Board.\n\nAs David Williams noted, \"The National Party, then in opposition, used all possible parliamentary devices to oppose this legislation and promised to repeal it immediately the Party gained office again. The general election campaign in 1975 had featured an acrimonious debate over the merits of the rival Labour and National superannuation policies.\" The National Party had suggested in its election campaign, and specifically in the Dancing Cossacks advertisement, that the superannuation scheme would have the effect of leading to Soviet-style communism.\n\nA general election was held on 29 November 1975, at which the Labour Party was voted out of government and on 12 December 1975 the Third National Government was formed with Robert Muldoon sworn in as Prime Minister. On 15 December, the Prime Minister, who was also Minister of Finance, issued a press statement declaring,\n\nOn 23 December, Prime Minister Muldoon issued another press release,\n\nThe plaintiff, Mr FitzGerald, had worked as a public servant since 3 June 1975 and he stated in his affidavit that he had since the beginning of his employment with the Crown, contributed at a rate of one percent of his earnings, amounting to $2.08 a fortnight. He further deposed that the Crown had been deducting this from his gross earnings and transferring this into the fund along with their contribution, until the pay period ending on 24 December 1975.\n\nFitzGerald sued the Prime Minister, as first defendant, and named the chairman and eight other members of the Superannuation Board as second defendant, the Attorney-General (in respect of the Treasury and Department of Education) as third defendant and the Controller and Auditor-General as fourth defendant.\n\nWild CJ summarised FitzGerald's case as being that the Prime Minister had, in contravention of the Bill of Rights 1688, section 1, made an announcement that constituted exercising a pretended power to suspend a properly made law, the Superannuation Act 1974. FitzGerald sought a declaration that the announcement and instructions issued by the Prime Minister on 15 December 1975 amounted to a breach of section 1 of the Bill of Rights 1688 and also injunctions requiring the withdrawal of the instruction and restraining the Prime Minister from further instructions to the Superannuation Board. A range of other declarations and injunctions was sought against the other defendants for their participation in the suspension of the superannuation scheme.\n\nIn his judgment Wild CJ surveyed the evidence of four public officials: Sir Arnold Nordmeyer, Chairman of the Superannuation Board; a Mr Kelly, assistant commissioner of the State Services Commission; the chief accountant of the Inland Revenue Department; and the general manager of the Superannuation Corporation.\n\nChief Justice Wild decided in favour of the plaintiff on one issue, that the Prime Minister's purported suspension of the operation of the New Zealand Superannuation Act 1975, \"was illegal as being in breach of s 1 of the Bill of Rights, and that the plaintiff is entitled to a declaration to that effect\".\n\nWild CJ also held that whether the meaning of \"by regal authority\" included the Prime Minister's statement was \n\nWild CJ found against the plaintiff that the evidence disclosed that there had been no instructions by the Prime Minister to any members of the Superannuation Board, any government department or arm of state services.\n\nBecause there was a high probability that the New Zealand Superannuation Act 1974 would be repealed and the scheme dismantled in the months following the hearing, Wild CJ adjourned all other matters for six months, satisfied that, \"In my opinion, the law and the authority of Parliament will be vindicated by the making of the declaration I have indicated\".\n\n"}

Under this system, the right to vote was based on £25 property franchise regardless of race.\n\nIn the ensuing decade, increasing numbers of the Cape's Black African citizens became politically active. By the 1880s, the Cape's Prime Minister Cecil Rhodes was disturbed by the prospect that white politicians may eventually be sidelined in many Cape Constituencies where non-white voters formed a majority. As more and more African citizens exercised their right to vote under the law as it existed, their vote looked to soon be decisive. \n\nThe Cape Colony was also unique of all the countries in southern Africa for its multi-racial franchise. At this time in the Transvaal and the Orange Free State indigenous Africans had no voting rights, and in Natal very few non-whites had the right to vote.\n\nThe Cape Colony's Franchise and Ballot Act of 1892 raised the franchise qualifications from £25 to £75, which effectively disenfranchised non-whites in significant enough numbers to make their voting powers negligible, although a proportion of poor whites were disenfranchised too.\n\nThis legislation settled the disputes as to whether non-whites had voting power in Cape Colony in the late 19th century, and is recognized as being an early example of legislation motivated by racial discrimination, although the law itself achieved its racially discriminatory aims only indirectly, through financially based clauses.\n\nHistory of Cape Colony from 1870 to 1899\n\n"}

The Archway is directly over Interstate 80 three miles (5 km) east of Kearney, Nebraska.\n\nThe Archway spans more than 300 feet over Interstate 80 east of Kearney, Nebraska and weighs nearly 1,500 tons. The Archway takes visitors along the trails, rails, highways and superhighways in a self-guided audio tour that includes stories of the travelers along the way. The show starts in the 1840s with the Mormon Trail, Oregon Trail and California Trail that converged at the nearby Fort Kearny before heading west. As visitors progress through the exhibit, the displays of different time periods feature a buffalo stampede, the Mormon Handcart Expedition, gold seekers, the Pony Express, the telegraph, the transcontinental railroad, the Lincoln Highway, a drive-in movie and a 1950s cafe. A new exit (Exit 275) immediately east of The Archway provides easy access. Exit 272 (to Kearney) also provides access to The Archway.\n\nA monument and tourist attraction highlighting the Platte River valley was a goal of former Governor Frank B. Morrison. In 1997, $60 million in bonds were issued and purchased by investors. On 16 July 2000, the Archway opened to the public, with 223,013 and 249,174 visitors in the attraction's first two years, respectively. First-year visitors included then-president Bill Clinton. These numbers were far short of projections. The monument had to reduce expenses and refinance its bond payments in 2002, reducing the amount owed to $22 million, repaid by 2013.\n\nWhile a shift in focus on educational and group tours briefly presented the monument with a more stable financial footing, attendance subsequently dwindled, counting only 49,960 visitors in 2012. The Archway filed for bankruptcy protection on March 7, 2013. In September 2013, U.S. federal bankruptcy judge Thomas Saladino approved a debt plan, ordering museum organizers to pay $100,000 as a settlement for more than $20 million it owed to bondholders, creditors and vendors. Wells Fargo Bank of Minneapolis was the trustee for the bondholders.\n\nAs part of the resolution of the bankruptcy filing, The Archway is managed by the City of Kearney. A second I-80 interchange was completed in August 2013 directly east of the museum at a cost of about $20 million, and is expected to boost attendance. Previously, eastbound motorists who missed the exit two miles west of the museum needed to travel 12 additional miles to get to the Archway. The lack of such an exit had been long blamed for part of the Archway's troubles.\n\nIn December 2013, the museum announced a two-month closure to re-brand itself following its debt ruling, scheduling its grand re-opening for March 1, 2014.\n\nThe Archway re-opened on March 1, 2014. Changes include a revamped gift shop, a new theater showing a short video detailing the building of the structure and its placement over the interstate.

A new charter was issued by Hamas leader Khaled Mashal on 1 May 2017 in Doha.\n\nThe original Charter identified Hamas as the Muslim Brotherhood in Palestine and declares its members to be Muslims who \"fear God and raise the banner of Jihad in the face of the oppressors.\" The charter states that \"our struggle against the Jews is very great and very serious\" and calls for the eventual creation of an Islamic state in Palestine, in place of Israel and the Palestinian Territories, and the obliteration or dissolution of Israel. It emphasizes the importance of jihad, stating in article 13, \"There is no solution for the Palestinian question except through Jihad. Initiatives, proposals and international conferences are all a waste of time and vain endeavors.\"\nThe charter also states that Hamas is humanistic, and tolerant of other religions as long as they \"stop disputing the sovereignty of Islam in this region\". The Charter adds that \"renouncing any part of Palestine means renouncing part of the religion\" of Islam.\n\nIn 2008, the Hamas leader in Gaza, Ismail Haniyeh, stated that Hamas would agree to accept a Palestinian state along the 1967 borders, and to offer a long-term truce with Israel. In contrast to this, Hamas leader Mahmoud al-Zahar stated that any talk of the 1967 lines is \"just a phase\" until Hamas has a chance to \"regain the land...even if we [Hamas] have to do so inch by inch.\" Other Hamas leaders, including Ismail Haniyah and Khaled Meshaal, have also stated repeatedly that \"Palestine – from the [Jordan] River to the [Mediterranean] Sea, from its north to its south – is our land, our right, and our homeland. There will be no relinquishing or forsaking even an inch or small part of it,\" and that \"we shall not relinquish the Islamic waqf on the land of Palestine, and Jerusalem shall not be divided into Western and Eastern Jerusalem. Jerusalem is a single united [city], and Palestine stretches from the Mediterranean Sea to the Jordan River, and from Naqoura [Rosh Ha-Niqra] to Umm Al-Rashrash [Eilat] in the south.\"\n\nIn 2009 interviews with the BBC, Tony Blair claimed that Hamas does not accept the existence of Israel and continues to pursue its objectives through terror and violence; Sir Jeremy Greenstock however argued that Hamas has not adopted its charter as part of its political program since it won the Palestinian legislative election, 2006. Instead it has moved to a more secular stance. In 2010, Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal stated that the Charter is \"a piece of history and no longer relevant, but cannot be changed for internal reasons.\" Hamas has moved away from its charter since it decided to run candidates for office.\n\nAfter a new charter was scheduled to be issued in May 2017, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office issued a statement in which it accused Hamas of trying to fool the world and also asked it to stop its terror activities for a true change.\n\nThe 2017 charter accepted for the first time the idea of a Palestinian state within the borders that existed before 1967 and rejects recognition of Israel which it terms as the \"Zionist enemy\". It advocates such a state as transitional but also advocates \"liberation of all of Palestine\". The new document also states that the group doesn't seek war with the Jewish people but only against Zionism which it holds responsible for \"occupation of Palestine\". Mashal also stated that Hamas was ending its association with the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nIn 1987, twenty years after the 1967 war, the First Intifada (1987–1993) began. In the late 1980s, the PLO sought a negotiated solution with Israel in the form of a two-state solution. This was not acceptable to Hamas, the Palestinian wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, and the covenant was written to bridge the ideological gap between the PLO and Muslim Brotherhood. According to Hamas's Deputy Foreign Minister Dr. Ahmed Yousef, the Charter \"was ratified during the unique circumstances of the Uprising in 1988 as a necessary framework for dealing with a relentless occupation\".\n\nWhile the PLO was nationalistic, it was more secular in nature, while Hamas subscribed to a neo-Salafi jihadi theology and nationalism. Hamas was a shift from the Muslim Brotherhood's more universal Islamic vision to a focus on Palestinian nationalism and a strategy of armed struggle, or violent jihad. Its political goals were identical to those of the PLO's charter and was essentially an armed struggle to retrieve the entire land of Palestine as an Islamic waqf.\n\nThe movement later came under pressure to update its founding charter issued in 1988 which called for Israel's destruction and advocated violent means for achieving a Palestinian state. The original charter's tone and casting the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as part of an eternal struggle between Muslim and Jews became an obstacle for the movement to be able to take part in diplomatic forums involving Western nations. The new charter also sought to question the ability of Fatah and its leader Mahmoud Abbas to act as the sole legitimate representative for the Palestinians. In addition, its ties to the Muslim Brotherhood had also damaged relationship with Egypt which considers the movement to be a terrorist organisation.\n\nDr. Ahmed Yousef, an adviser to Ismail Haniyeh (the senior political leader of Hamas), claimed that Hamas has changed its views over time since the charter was issued in 1988. In 2010 Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal stated that the Charter is \"a piece of history and no longer relevant, but cannot be changed for internal reasons.\"\n\nIn 2006, Hamas proposed government programme, which stated that \"the question of recognizing Israel is not the jurisdiction of one faction, nor the government, but a decision for the Palestinian people.\" However many remain sceptical of Hamas's new stance, and view it as a ploy to hide its true agenda, \"but it is equally true that the \"new\" discourse of diluted religious content—to say nothing of the movement's increasing pragmatism and flexibility in the political domain—reflects genuine and cumulative changes within Hamas.\"\n\nContrastingly, Mahmoud Zahar, co-founder of Hamas, said in 2006 that Hamas \"will not change a single word in its covenant.\" In 2010, he reaffirmed a major commitment of the covenant saying \"Our ultimate plan is [to have] Palestine in its entirety. I say this loud and clear so that nobody will accuse me of employing political tactics. We will not recognize the Israeli enemy.\"\n\nIn 2011, Atallah Abu al-Subh, the former Hamas minister of culture, said that \"the Jews are the most despicable and contemptible nation to crawl upon the face of the Earth, because they have displayed hostility to Allah. Allah will kill the Jews in the hell of the world to come, just like they killed the believers in the hell of this world.\"\n\nPer Nathan Thrall, an analyst working for the International Crisis Group, the original charter had been a long source of embarrassment among the reformists in the movement.\n\n\nThe Preamble to the Charter states: ″Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam invalidates it, just as it invalidated others before it″.\n\nAccording to Abraham Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League, \"The Hamas credo is not just anti-Israel, but profoundly anti-Semitic with racism at its core. The Hamas Charter reads like a modern-day \"Mein Kampf\".\" According to the charter, Jewish people \"have only negative traits and are presented as planning to take over the world.\" The charter claims that the Jews deserve God's/Allah's enmity and wrath because they received the Scriptures but violated its sacred texts, disbelieved the signs of Allah, and slew their own prophets. It quotes a saying of Muhammad from a hadith:\n\nThe charter goes further in detailing how Jihad against the Jews is a duty. \"The day that enemies usurp part of Moslem land, Jihad becomes the individual duty of every Moslem. In face of the Jews' usurpation of Palestine, it is compulsory that the banner of Jihad be raised. To do this requires the diffusion of Islamic consciousness among the masses, both on the regional, Arab and Islamic levels. It is necessary to instill the spirit of Jihad in the heart of the nation so that they would confront the enemies and join the ranks of the fighters.\"\n\nThe charter contains references to anti-Semitic canards, such as the assertion that through shrewd manipulation of imperial countries and secret societies, Jews were behind a wide range of events and disasters going as far back in history as the French Revolution.\n\nWith their money, they took control of the world media, news agencies, the press, publishing houses, broadcasting stations, and others. With their money they stirred revolutions in various parts of the world with the purpose of achieving their interests and reaping the fruit therein. They were behind the French Revolution, the Communist revolution and most of the revolutions we heard and hear about, here and there. With their money, they formed secret societies, such as Freemason, Rotary Clubs, the Lions and others in different parts of the world for the purpose of sabotaging societies and achieving Zionist interests. With their money they were able to control imperialistic countries and instigate them to colonize many countries in order to enable them to exploit their resources and spread corruption there.\n\nIt continues by accusing the Jews of engineering World War I and it echoes Nazi propaganda in claiming that Jews profited during World War II.\n\nThe document also quotes Islamic religious texts to provide justification for fighting against and killing the Jews, without distinction of whether they are in Israel or elsewhere. It presents the Arab–Israeli conflict as an inherently irreconcilable struggle between Jews and Muslims, and Judaism and Islam, adding that the only way to engage in this struggle between \"truth and falsehood\" is through Islam and by means of jihad, until victory or martyrdom.\n\nHistorian Jeffrey Herf argues that unlike the PLO, which has distinguished their national struggle against Zionism from general anti-Semitism (rhetorically, at least), Hamas, in their covenant, have purposefully fused these two struggles into one against the Jews and their country.\n\n\n"}

Plumer, 380 U.S. 460 (1965), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States, in which the Court further refined the \"Erie\" doctrine regarding when and by what means federal courts are obliged to apply state law in cases brought under diversity jurisdiction. The question in the instant case was whether Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governing service of process should yield to state rules governing the service of process in diversity cases. The Court ruled that under the facts of this case, federal courts shall apply the federal rule.\n\nOn February 6, 1963, petitioner, a citizen of Ohio, filed her complaint in the District Court for the District of Massachusetts, claiming damages in excess of $10,000 for personal injuries resulting from an automobile accident in South Carolina, allegedly caused by the negligence of one Louise Plumer Osgood, a Massachusetts citizen deceased at the time of the filing of the complaint. Respondent, Mrs. Osgood's executor and also a Massachusetts citizen, was named as defendant. The Massachusetts rule at the time required personal service of process on the executor of an in-state defendant, while Fed. R. Civ. P. 4 (d)(1) required only that service be made on a competent adult who resides at the residence of the defendant. The plaintiff left process at the residence of the executor, and so complied with the federal rule but not the state rule. The District Court granted summary judgment to the executor for the plaintiff's failure to make adequate service of process, ruling that the state rule applied based on the Supreme Court's prior precedents. The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed.\n\nChief Justice Earl Warren delivered the majority opinion, which held that the adoption of rule 4(d)(1) did not overstep the constitutional boundaries or the legislative intent of Congress in enacting the Rules Enabling Act (28 U.S.C. 2072) noting that \"...the test must be whether a rule really regulates procedure...\" Thus it was appropriate to apply Rule 4(d)(1) (now FRCP (4)(e)(2)) and not Massachusetts law in the Federal District Court. In reaching this decision the Court stated that the rule that state and federal courts should reach outcomes substantially the same was not a \"talisman\" and that there were more basic principles governing \"Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins\" and its progeny (that is, cases dealing with how Federal courts should apply state law). The purpose of \"Erie\" was to 1) discourage \"forum shopping\" and 2) avoid inequitable administration of laws. The instant case must be viewed in this light. While the outcome of the current case is determined by which law is applied, the rights in question are not substantial enough to create problems of unequal protection and because in \"Erie\" and its progeny there was no explicit conflict between state and federal rules. Thus, in those cases the Court held not that state rules trumped federal rules but that the federal rules, narrowly construed, did not cover the dispute whereas in the current case the federal and state laws are in direct conflict and the court has been instructed to follow the Federal Rule in these cases and there is no constitutional reason not to do so. In short, outcome determinative judgments are important under the American legal system for deciding if a state or federal rule applies but in the current case denying the federal rule would remove any power whatsoever the federal courts have over their procedures. Harlan argued that forum shopping and equitable administration of laws were not the only concerns in \"Erie\" because public uncertainty over which laws govern would be debilitating and therefore state law controls where it is an issue of affecting \"primary decisions respecting human conduct.\" Under this understanding federal laws could be trumped by a state law, whether substantive or procedural law, meaning that Harlan's test is somewhere in between the \"outcome determinative test\" which gives extreme deference to state laws and the \"forum shopping/equitable administration test\" given in the case at hand, which states that a party must \"substantially\" raise equal protection issues.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31515791", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31515791", "title": "Ispendje", "text": "Ispendje\n\nİspençe was a tax levied on non-Muslims in the Ottoman Empire.\n\nİspençe was a land-tax on non-Muslims in parts of the Ottoman Empire; its counterpart, for Muslim taxpayers, was the resm-i çift - which was set at slightly lower rate. The treasury was well aware of the difference in tax takes, and the incentive to convert; the legal reforms of Bayezid II halved some criminal penalties on nonmuslim taxpayers \"so that the taxpayers shall not vanish\"; this rule was reconfimed, a century later, in 1587. In other cases, local taxes were imposed on nonmuslims specifically to encourage conversion.\n\nİspençe had existed in the Balkans before the Ottoman conquest; the Ottoman Empire typically adapted local taxes and institutions in each conquered area, leading to a patchwork of different taxes and rates. The concept of İspençe, theoretically a payment in lieu of corvee labour, was derived from the Byzantine \"zeugaratikion\", a land tax based on the zeugarion - the area of farmland which could be ploughed by a pair of oxen. The zeugarion itself was taken up as the Ottoman \"çift\", a word meaning \"pair\".\n\nDespite taxes being set centrally, by the Porte, there was some local variance; around 1718. the kadı of Janjevo complained to Istanbul that the local lord set ispençe at 80 akçes per year rather than official rate of 32.\n\nAs with other Ottoman taxes, there were various exemptions and loopholes; royal hunters, who provided birds-of-prey to the court, had an exemption from ispençe (and other taxes); they could pass on their job, and the tax exemption, to their sons. There were also some exemptions for those unable to work their land through disability, although it was expected that the elderly would have children able to work and therefore to pay ispençe.\n\nThe tax was paid by adult male heads of households; in the Morea it increased to 25 akces (from 20) between 1480 and 1512, and stayed at a similar level after that, (for most), confirmed by the tahrir of 1583; but widows may have paid a reduced rate, and Jews may have paid 125 akces.\n"}
{"id": "48345368", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48345368", "title": "Jaime Eyzaguirre", "text": "Jaime Eyzaguirre\n\nJaime Eyzaguirre (21 December 1908 – 17 September 1968) was a Chilean lawyer, essayist and historian. He is variously recognized as a writer of traditionalist or conservative historiography in his country.\n\nEyzaguirre was born into a religious upper class family in Santiago. As young man he studied law in the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile (PUC) and was member of the Catholic student organization Asociación Nacional de Estudiantes Católicos. During his studies he was influenced by the Jesuit Fernando Vives and the writings of Manuel Lacunza.\n\nEyzaguirre started to court Adriana Philippi in 1929 and married her in 1934.\n\nThe PUC founded its Pedagogy School (\"Escuela de Pedagogía\") in 1943 and contracted Eyzaguirre to be in charge of the History of Chile (\"Historia de Chile\") classes. Most of the students of the time were priests, nuns and brothers. He was assisted by Mario Góngora is some classes. Apart from this part-time work Eyzaguirre was also part-time teacher at Liceo Alemán.\nAt the Pedagogy School Eyzaguirre met Ricardo Krebs, who was also history teacher but had rather few contacts, and introduced him to the Catholic intellectual elite of Santiago. His salary is reported to have been low at PUC and when \"raised\" it mostly had to do with the currency inflation experienced in Chile. Nevertheless he was allowed to rent a small local owned by the Archbishopric of Santiago at a relatively low price. Here, Eyzaguirre ran a small bookshop called \"El Arbol\" until the late 1950s when it was closed. Despite his economic hardships he twice refused to be assigned ambassador to Spain. Eyzaguirre thought any diplomatic work he did would need to compete with his work as historian and therefore he would not be able to accomplish a dedicated work in diplomacy. At the same time the writings of Léon Bloy provided him with comfort about his economic hardship.\n\nA milestone in the work of Eyzaguirre was his essay \"O'Higgins\" that won a prize in 1946 to commemorate the centenary of the death of Bernardo O'Higgins. This was the first written work that granted Eyzaguirre some income. The prize reward helped Eyzaguirre to finance a trip to Spain in 1947. This seven months long journey reinforced his leanings for Spanish heritage in his historiography. In Spain Eyzaguirry held a course on Chilean political and constitutional history at Universidad Central de Madrid. His stay in Spain made him target of attacks in Chile from those critical of the Franco regime, in particular from people associated with the \"National Falange\" party (not to be confused with the Spanish movement). Personally, Eyzaguirre admired the stoic stance of the isolated Francoist Spain against both Soviet and Western pressure but did never propagandize the Franco regime in Chile.\n\nFor a time he was teacher of Jaime Guzmán. When the journal \"Historia\" was established in 1961 Eyzaguirre served as its first director.\n\nGenerally Eyzaguirre dealt with similar topics as Lewis Hanke. He despised 19th century writers such as José Victorino Lastarria and Domingo Faustino Sarmiento because he considered they \"ruptured\" the historical links to Spain and characterized their views as \"apostasy\".\n\nThe work of Eyzaguirre was criticized by historians associated with left-wing historiography. Mario Céspedes said in reference to Eyzaguirre's writings on the conquest of Chile that the conquest was a search for indian labourers and \"not a chivalrous journey\". On the essay \"O'Higgins\" Céspedes wrote that it lacked \"the social and economic causes of the facts\". Historian Julio César Jobet made a more harsh criticism accusing Eyzaguirre of \"exalting backward doctrines and institutions\" and undermining the influence of \"French rationalist and critical thought in the development and progress of Chile\".\n\n"}
{"id": "8449456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8449456", "title": "Juan Valdez drinks Costa Rican coffee", "text": "Juan Valdez drinks Costa Rican coffee\n\nJuan Valdez drinks Costa Rican coffee () is a slogan, implying that Juan Valdez, a fictional character created by the Federación Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia (Fedcafé), drinks coffee from Costa Rica. In Costa Rica, the slogan is popular on bumper stickers. The slogan prompted a lawsuit for the first time in 2006, when Federación Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia sued Café Britt following a t-shirt dispute.\n\nThe origins of the slogan are unclear. Juan Valdez has appeared in advertisements for Colombian coffee since 1959. Jaime Daremblum, then-Costa Rican ambassador to the United States, used the phrase in a 1999 speech. \nApparently the message about Juan Valdez as a drinker of Costa Rican coffee was attributed to José Duval, a New York-based actor, who was the first Juan Valdez.\n\nIn 2006, The Federación Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia received an injunction preventing the Costa Rican company Café Britt from selling t-shirts with the slogan. Fedcafé then filed a $1 million lawsuit on July 7, 2006, after Café Britt refused to sign a contract, stating that it must respect the intellectual property of Federación Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia and refrain from using either the name or image of Juan Valdez. Café Britt filed a $200,000 counter-suit, after producing an affidavit from a Costa Rican man, Juan Valdez, certifying that \"he\" does drink Costa Rican coffee. Café Britt also argued that the phrase is so common as to be ineligible for legal protection.\n\nFedcafé maintains that Café Britt agreed in early 2006 to stop using its trademarks; Pablo Vargas, the manager of Café Britt, denies that such an agreement existed. \nThe only and final agreement, according to Fedcafé's proposal of January 19, 2006, consisted in the total recall of the t-shirts. This is the agreement Britt accepted and executed on that same date. In exchange, Fedcafé committed to dismiss any further legal process. \n\nThe \"other\" Juan Valdez was discovered as early as 1999.\n\nCafé Britt presented a criminal case against Gabriel Silva, Federacafé's manager, for presumably defamatory statements, as well as taking civil action against him for damages of $1,000,000. Mr. Silva was notified in Colombia through diplomatic channels. All charges have since been dropped. When asked to comment, Silva's lawyer, Kyle Hoskinson, stated, \"I'm glad this is all over.\"\n"}
{"id": "44719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44719", "title": "Judge", "text": "Judge\n\nA judge is a person who presides over court proceedings, either alone or as a part of a panel of judges. The powers, functions, method of appointment, discipline, and training of judges vary widely across different jurisdictions. The judge is supposed to conduct the trial impartially and, typically, in an open court. The judge hears all the witnesses and any other evidence presented by the barristers of the case, assesses the credibility and arguments of the parties, and then issues a ruling on the matter at hand based on his or her interpretation of the law and his or her own personal judgment. In some jurisdictions, the judge's powers may be shared with a jury. In inquisitorial systems of criminal investigation, a judge might also be an examining magistrate.\n\nThe ultimate task of a judge is to settle a legal dispute in a final and public manner, and thus affirm the rule of law. Judges exercise significant governmental power. They can order police, military or judicial officials to execute searches, arrests, imprisonments, garnishments, distrainments, seizures, deportations and similar actions. However, judges also supervise that trial procedures are followed, in order to ensure consistency and impartiality and avoid arbitrariness. The powers of a judge are checked by higher courts such as appeals courts and supreme courts.\n\nBefore the trial, a pre-trial investigation collecting the facts has been conducted by police officials, such as police officers and coroners, prosecutors or public procurators. The court usually has three main legally trained court officials: the judge, the prosecutor and the defence attorney. The role of a judge varies between legal systems. In an adversarial system (common law), as in effect in the U.S. and England, the judge functions as an impartial referee, mainly ensuring correct procedure, while the prosecution and the defense present their case to a jury, often selected from common citizens. The main factfinder is the jury, and the judge will then finalize sentencing. Nevertheless, in smaller cases judges can issue summary judgments without proceeding to a jury trial. In an inquisitorial system (civil law), as in effect in continental Europe, there is no jury and the main factfinder is the judge, who will do the presiding, judging and sentencing on his own. As such, the judge is expected to apply the law directly, as in the French expression \"Le juge est la bouche de la loi\" (\"The judge is the mouth of the law\"). Furthermore, in some system even investigation may be conducted by the judge, functioning as an examining magistrate.\n\nJudges may work alone in smaller cases, but in criminal, family and other significant cases, they work in a panel. In some civil law systems, this panel may include lay judges. Unlike professional judges, lay judges are not legally trained, but unlike jurors, lay judges are usually volunteers and may be politically appointed. Judges are often assisted by law clerks, referendaries and notaries in legal cases and by bailiffs or similar with security.\n\nThere are both volunteer and professional judges. A volunteer judge, such as an English magistrate, is not required to have legal training and is unpaid. Whereas, a professional judge is required to be legally educated; in the U.S., this generally requires a degree of Juris Doctor. Furthermore, significant professional experience is often required; for example, in the U.S., judges are often appointed from experienced attorneys. Judges are often appointed by the head of state. In some U.S. jurisdictions, however, judges are elected in a political election.\n\nImpartiality is often considered important for rule of law. Thus, in many jurisdictions judges may be appointed for life, so that they cannot be removed by the executive. However, in non-democratic systems, the appointment of judges may be highly politicized and they often receive instructions on how to judge, and may be removed if their conduct doesn't please the political leadership.\n\nJudges must be able to research and process extensive lengths of documents and other case material, understand complex cases and possess a thorough understanding of the law and legal procedure, which requires excellent skills in logical reasoning, analysis and decision-making. Excellent writing skills are also a necessity, given the finality and authority of the documents written. Judges work with people all the time; by the nature of the job, good dispute resolution and interpersonal skills are a necessity. Judges are required to have good moral character, i.e. there must be no history of crime. Professional judges often enjoy a high salary, in the U.S. the median salary of judges is $101,690 per annum, and federal judges earn $208,000-$267,000 per annum.\n\nA variety of traditions have become associated with the rank or occupation. Gavels (a ceremonial hammer) are used by judges in many countries, to the point that the gavel has become a symbol of a judge. In many parts of the world, judges wear long robes (often in black or red) and sit on an elevated platform during trials (known as the bench).\n\nAmerican judges frequently wear black robes. American judges have ceremonial gavels, although American judges have court deputies or bailiffs and \"contempt of court\" power as their main devices to maintain decorum in the courtroom. However, in some of the Western United States, like California, judges did not always wear robes and instead wore everyday clothing. Today, some members of state supreme courts, such as the Maryland Court of Appeals wear distinct dress. In Italy and Portugal, both judges and lawyers wear particular black robes.\n\nIn some countries, especially in the Commonwealth of Nations, judges wear wigs. The long wig often associated with judges is now reserved for ceremonial occasions, although it was part of the standard attire in previous centuries. A short wig resembling but not identical to a barrister's wig (a Bench Wig) would be worn in court. This tradition, however, is being phased out in Britain in non-criminal courts.\n\nIn Oman, the judge wears a long stripe (red, green white), while the attorneys wear the black gown.\n\nIn Portugal and in the former Portuguese Empire, the judges used to carry a staff that was red for ordinary judges and white for the judges from the outside.\n\nIn Hong Kong, court proceedings are conducted in either English or Hong Kong Cantonese (a dialect of Yue Chinese). Judges of Hong Kong retain many of the English traditions such as wearing wigs and robes in trials.\n\nIn the lower courts, magistrates are addressed as \"Your worship\", and district court judges as \"Your Honour\".\n\nIn the superior courts of record, namely the Court of Final Appeal and the High Court (which consists of the Court of Appeal and the Court of First Instance), judges are addressed as \"My Lord\" or \"My Lady\" and referred to as \"Your Lordship\" or \"Your Ladyship\", following the English tradition.\n\nIn writing, the post-nominal letters \"PJ\" is used to refer to a permanent judge of the Court of Final Appeal and \"NPJ\" to a non-permanent judge. In the High Court, the abbreviation \"JA\" is used to denote a justice of appeal, and the letter \"J\" refers to a judge of the Court of First Instance.\n\nMasters of the High Court are addressed as \"Master\".\n\nWhen trials are conducted in Chinese, judges were addressed, in Cantonese, as \"Fat Goon Dai Yan\" () before the transfer of sovereignty from the United Kingdom to China, and as \"Fat Goon Gok Ha\" () since 1997. \"Fat Goon\" () means \"judge\".\n\nIn India, judges of the Supreme Court and the High Courts were addressed as \"Your Lordship\" or \"My Lord\" and \"Your Ladyship\" or \"My Lady\", a tradition directly attributable to England. The Bar Council of India had adopted a resolution in April 2006 and added a new Rule 49(1)(j) in the Advocates Act. As per the rule, lawyers can address the court as \"Your Honour\" and refer to it as \"Honourable Court\". If it is a subordinate court, lawyers can use terms such as \"sir\" or any equivalent phrase in the regional language concerned. Explaining the rationale behind the move, the Bar Council had held that the words such as \"My Lord\" and \"Your Lordship\" were \"relics of the colonial past\". The resolution has since been circulated to all state councils and the Supreme Court for adoption but over five years now, the resolution largely remained on paper.\n\nHowever, in an unprecedented move in October 2009, one of the judges of Madras HC, Justice K Chandru had banned lawyers from addressing his court as \"My Lord\" and \"Your Lordship\".\n\nIn Israel, the judges () of all courts are addressed as \"Sir\", \"Madam\" () or \"Your Honor\" (). Typically after every naming you will hear \"haShofét\", meaning \"the judge\" after the respective address. For example, \"Your Honor the Judge\" would be (\"kabowd haShofét\").\n\nIn Malaysia, judges of the subordinate courts are addressed as \"Tuan\" or \"Puan\" (\"Sir\", \"Madam\"), or \"Your Honour\". Judges of the superior courts are addressed as \"Yang Arif\" ( \"Learned One\") or \"My Lord\", \"My Lady\", etc.; and \"Your Lordship\" or \"My Ladyship\" if the proceedings, as they generally are in the superior courts, are in English.\n\nIn Pakistan, judges of the Supreme Court and the high courts are addressed as \"Your Lordship\" or \"My Lord\" or \"Lordship\" and \"Your Ladyship\" or \"My Lady\", a tradition directly attributable to England. There is some resistance to this on religious grounds but more or less continues till this day. In lower courts, judges are addressed as \"sir\", \"madam\" or the Urdu equivalent \"Janab\" or \"Judge Sahab\".\n\nIn Sri Lanka, judges of most courts are addressed as \"Your Honour\", however the Chief Justice is addressed as \"Your Lordship\". Judges of the Supreme Court and the Appeal Court receives the title \"The Honourable\".\n\nJudges in Vietnam are addressed as \"\" (literally the \"Honorable Court\").\n\nIn Bulgaria before 1989 during the communist regime, judges were addressed as \"drugarju\" (). After 1989, \"gospodín sŭdiya\" () or \"gospožo sŭdiya\" ().\n\nThere is no special form of address; ordinary politeness is sufficient and the procedure lacks arcane rituals. Accordingly, the chairman of the panel is addressed as \"herra/rouva puheenjohtaja\" (\"Mr./Ms. Chairman\"). Finnish judges use gavels, but there are no robes or cloaks used in any Finnish courts.\n\nIn a district court (\"käräjäoikeus\"), ordinary judges work with the title \"käräjätuomari\" and the chairman is \"laamanni\" (lawspeaker). They are assisted by notaries (\"notaari\"), assessors (\"asessori\") and referendaries (\"viskaali\") who may sometimes even chair sessions. In appeals courts (\"hovioikeus\") an ordinary judge has the title \"hovioikeudenneuvos\", the chairman of a section is \"hovioikeudenlaamanni\" and the court is led by a \"presidentti\". In the Supreme Court, judges are titled \"oikeusneuvos\" and the court is led by a \"presidentti\".\n\nIn France, the presiding judge of a court is addressed as \"Monsieur le président\" or \"Madame le président\", whilst associated judges are addressed as \"Monsieur l'Assesseur\" or \"Madame l'Assesseur\". Out of the courtroom, judges are referred to as \"Monsieur le juge\" or \"Madame le juge\".\n\nIn Germany, judges are addressed as \"Herr Vorsitzender\" or \"Frau Vorsitzende\", which translate as \"Mister Chairman\" and \"Madam Chairwoman\", or as \"Hohes Gericht\".\n\nThe male presiding judge of a court is addressed as \"tisztelt bíró úr\", which means \"Honourable Mister Judge\" and a female presiding judge is addressed as \"tisztelt bírónő\", which means \"Honourable Madam Judge\". The court as a body can be addressed as \"tisztelt bíróság\", which means \"Honourable Court\".\n\nJudges of the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal, or High Court are officially titled \"The Honourable Mr/Mrs/Ms/Miss Justice Surname\" (), and informally referred to for short as \"Mr/Mrs/Ms/Miss Justice Surname\". In court, they are addressed either by their respective titles or styles, as \"The Court\" (\"An Chúirt\"), or simply \"Judge\" (\"A Bhreithimh\"). In law reports, the Chief Justice of Ireland has the postnominal \"CJ\", the Presidents of the other Courts have the postnominal \"P\", and all other judges \"J\", e.g. \"Smith J\".\n\nJudges of the Circuit Court are titled \"His/Her Honour Judge Surname\" and are addressed in Court as \"Judge\". Before 2006, they were addressed as \"My Lord\" (\"A thiarna\") .\n\nJudges of the District Court are titled \"Judge Surname\" and addressed in Court as \"Judge\". Before 1991 these judges were known as District Justices and addressed as \"Your Worship\" (\"d'Onóra\").\n\nIn Italy, the presiding judge of a court is addressed as \"Signor presidente della corte\".\n\nIn the Netherlands, presiding judges of either sex are, in writing only, addressed \"edelachtbare\" (\"Your Honour\") for judges in the Court of First Instance, \"edelgrootachtbare\" (\"Your Great Honour\") for justices in the Court of Appeal and \"edelhoogachtbare\" (\"Your High Honour\") for justices in the High Council of the Netherlands (Supreme Court).\n\nIn Poland, presiding judges of either sex during trial are addressed \"Wysoki Sądzie\" (\"High Court\").\n\nIn Portugal, presiding judges during trial are addressed as \"Meretíssimo Juiz\" when a man or \"Meretíssima Juíza\" when a woman (meaning \"Most Worthy Judge\") or as \"Vossa Excelência\" (\"Your Excellency\") when not specifying gender.\n\nIn Russia, \"Vasha Chest\" () is used for criminal cases only with the one judge presiding. For civil, commercial and criminal cases presided over by a panel of judges the right address is \"Honorable Court\".\n\nIn Spain, magistrates of the Supreme Court, magistrates and judges are addressed to as \"Your Lordship\" (\"Su Señoría\"); however, in formal occasions, magistrates of the Supreme Court are addressed to as \"Your Right Honorable Lordship\" (\"Vuestra Señoría Excelentísima\" or \"Excelentísimo Señor\"/\"Excelentísima Señora\"); in those solemn occasions, magistrates of lower Courts are addressed as \"Your Honorable Lordship\" (\"Vuestra Señoría Ilustrísima\" or \"Ilustrísimo Señor\"/\"Ilustrísima Señora\"); simple judges are always called \"Your Lordship\".\n\nIn Sweden, the presiding judge of a court is normally addressed as \"Herr Ordförande\" or \"Fru Ordförande\", which translate as \"Mister Chairman\" and \"Madam Chairwoman\".\n\nIn the Courts of England and Wales, Supreme Court judges are called Justices of the Supreme Court. Justices of the Supreme Court who do not hold life peerages are now given the courtesy style \"Lord\" or \"Lady.\" Justices of the Supreme Court are addressed as \"My Lord/Lady\" in court. In the law reports, the Justices of the Supreme Court are usually referred to as \"Lord/Lady N\", although the Weekly Law Reports appends the post-nominal letters \"JSC\" (e.g. \"Lady Smith JSC\"). The President and Deputy President of the Court are afforded the post-nominal letters PSC and DPSC respectively. Only experienced barristers or solicitors are usually appointed as judges.\n\nJudges of the High Court and Court of Appeal are addressed (when sitting in those courts) as \"My Lord\" or \"My Lady\" and referred to as \"Your Lordship\" or \"Your Ladyship\".\n\nJudges of the Court of Appeal, also called Lords Justice of Appeal, are referred to as \"Lord Justice N\" or \"Lady Justice N.\" In legal writing, Lords Justices of Appeal are afforded the post nominal letters \"LJ:\" for example, Smith LJ.\n\nWhen a Justice of the High Court who is not present is being referred to they are described as \"Mr./Mrs./Ms. Justice \"N.\"\" In legal writing, the post-nominal letter \"J\" is used to denote a Justice (male or female) of the High Court: for example, Smith J.\nMasters of the High Court are addressed as \"Master\".\n\nCircuit Judges and Recorders are addressed as \"Your Honour\". Circuit judges are referred to as \"His/Her Honour Judge N.\" In writing, this title is occasionally abbreviated as \"HHJ\" or \"HH Judge N\", but not in legal writing. district judges and tribunal judges are addressed as \"Sir/Madam\".\n\nLay magistrates are sometimes still addressed as \"Your Worship\" in much of England, although in northern England \"Your Honour\" is more usually used by advocates before the court. Lay magistrates are also addressed as \"Sir/Madam.\"\n\nIn the Courts of Scotland judges in the Court of Session, High Court of Justiciary and Sheriff Courts are all addressed as \"My Lord\" or \"My Lady\" and referred to as \"Your Lordship\" or \"Your Ladyship\".\n\nJustices of the Peace in Justice of the Peace Courts are addressed and referred to as \"Your Honour\".\n\nThe judicial system of Northern Ireland is very similar to that of England and Wales, and superior court judges are addressed the same way as those in England and Wales. However, there are a few differences at the lower levels.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, the equivalent to a Circuit Judge is a County Court Judge, and they are addressed and titled the same way as a Circuit Judge is in England and Wales. The senior County Court Judges assigned to the County Court Divisions of Belfast and Derry have the titles of Recorder of Belfast and Recorder of Londonderry (or Derry) respectively, but are addressed the same as other County Court Judges. A district judge sitting in the County Court is addressed as \"Your Honour\".\n\nA District Judge (Magistrates' Court) is addressed as \"Your Worship\". A Lay Magistrate, in cases where they are present, is also addressed as \"Your Worship\", and may use the post nominals \"LM\", e.g. \"John Smith LM\".\n\nIn general, Canadian judges may be addressed directly, depending on the province, as \"My Lord\", \"My Lady\", \"Your Honour\" or \"Justice\" and are formally referred to in the third person as \"The Honourable Mr. (or Madam) Justice 'Forename Surname'\". Less formally, judges of a Superior Court are referred to as \"Justice 'Surname'\", not as \"Judge 'Surname.'\" When referred to in a decision of a court, judges' titles are often abbreviated to the suffix \"J.\", so that Justice Smith will be referred to as Smith J. Judges in some superior courts are addressed as \"My Lord\" or \"My Lady\". In Ontario, judges are never referred to as \"My Lord\" or \"My Lady,\" but only as \"Your Honour\" at the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. Formerly, translations of these titles such as \"Votre Honneur\" (\"your honour\") or \"Votre Seigneurie\" (\"your lordship\") were used in French; today, only \"Monsieur le juge\" and \"Madame la juge\" are officially used. Both the titles \"judge\" and \"justice\" are translated \"juge.\"\n\nGenerally, it is only appropriate to use the term \"judge\" when speaking of an anonymous or general position, such as \"the trial judge,\" or when referring to a member of an inferior or provincial court such as the Ontario Court of Justice. The exception is Citizenship Judges who are referred to only as \"Judge 'Surname.'\" in accordance with their appointment as independent decision makers of the Citizenship Commission.\n\nLike other members of the Commonwealth, a justice of the peace is addressed as \"Your Worship,\" and a Master of a Superior Court is both addressed and referred to as \"Master.\"\n\nIn many states throughout the United States, a judge is addressed as \"Your Honor\" or \"Judge\" when presiding over the court. \"Judge\" may be more commonly used by attorneys and staff, while either may be commonly used by the plaintiff or defendant. Notably, the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, the largest unified trial court in the United States, has a rule that the judge shall be addressed only as \"Your Honor\" while in court, and never as \"Judge,\" \"Judge (name),\" \"ma'am,\" or \"sir.\" This is somewhat unusual as \"Judge\" and \"Judge (name)\" or similar forms of address are considered appropriate and respectful in many other courts.\n\nThe judges of the Supreme Court of the United States, and the judges of the supreme courts of several US states and other countries are called \"justices\". Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States and Justices of other courts are addressed as \"Justice (name).\" The Chief Justice of the United States is formally addressed as \"Mr. Chief Justice\" but also may be identified and addressed as \"Chief Justice (name)\".\n\nThe justices of the supreme courts usually hold higher offices than any other judges in a jurisdiction, including a justice of the peace, a judge who holds police court in some jurisdictions and who may also try small claims and misdemeanors. However, the state of New York inverts this usual order. The initial trial court in this state is called the Supreme Court of New York, and its judges are called \"justices\". The next highest appellate court is the Supreme Court, Appellate Division, whose judges are also called \"justices\". However, the highest court in New York is called the New York Court of Appeals, whose members are called \"judges\".\n\nJudges in certain jurisdictions, such as New York and New Jersey, who deal with guardianships, trusts and estates are known as \"surrogates.\"\n\nA \"senior judge,\" in US practice, is a retired judge who handles selected cases for a governmental entity while in retirement, on a part-time basis.\n\nSubordinate or inferior jurisdiction judges in US legal practice are sometimes called magistrates, although in the federal court of the United States, they are called magistrate judges. Subordinate judges in US legal practice who are appointed on a case-by-case basis, particularly in cases where a great deal of detailed and tedious evidence must be reviewed, are often called \"masters\" or \"special masters\" and have authority in a particular case often determined on a case by case basis.\n\nJudges of courts of specialized jurisdiction (such as bankruptcy courts or juvenile courts) were sometimes known officially as \"referees,\" but the use of this title is in decline. Judges sitting in courts of equity in common law systems (such as judges in the equity courts of Delaware) are called \"chancellors.\"\n\nIndividuals with judicial responsibilities who report to an executive branch official, rather than being a part of the judiciary, are often called \"administrative law judges\" in US practice. They were previously known as hearing examiners. They commonly make initial determinations regarding matters such as workers' compensation, eligibility for government benefits, regulatory matters, and immigration determinations.\n\nJudges who derive their authority from a contractual agreement of the parties to a dispute, rather than a governmental body, are called arbitrators. They typically do not receive the honorific forms of address nor do they bear the symbolic trappings of a publicly appointed judge. However, it is now common for many retired judges to serve as arbitrators, and they will often write their names as if they were still judges, with the parenthetical \"(Ret.)\" for \"Retired.\"\n\nUnlike many civil law countries; which have some courts on which panels of judges with nearly equal status composed of both legally trained professional judges and lay judges who lack legal training and are not career judges, the United States legal system (like most Anglo-American legal systems) makes a clear distinction between professional judges and laypeople involved in deciding a case who are jurors who are part of a jury. Most but not all US judges have professional credentials as lawyers. Non-lawyer judges in the United States are often elected, and are typically either justices of the peace or part-time judges in rural limited jurisdiction courts. A non-lawyer judge typically has the same rights and responsibilities as a lawyer who is a judge holding the same office and is addressed in the same manner.\n\nIn Australia judges and, since 2007, magistrates, of all jurisdictions including the High Court of Australia are now addressed as \"Your Honour\". In legal contexts, they are referred to as \"His/Her Honour\" and \"the Honourable Justice Surname\" (for judges of superior courts) or \"his/her Honour Judge Surname\" (for inferior courts). Outside legal contexts, the formal terms of address are \"Judge\" (for puisne justices) or \"Chief Justice\" (for chief justices).\n\nThe title for most puisne judges is \"Justice\", which is abbreviated in law reports to a postnominal \"J\", in the form \"Surname J\". Chief Justices of the High Court and of state Supreme Courts are titled \"Chief Justice\", which is abbreviated in law reports to a postnomial \"CJ\". Judges in State Supreme Courts with a separate Court of Appeal division (New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia) are referred to as Justices/Judges of the Appeal (abbreviated \"Surname JA\"), while the President of the Court of Appeal is referred to as \"President\" (abbreviated \"Surname P\").\n\nIn New Zealand, judges of the District Court of New Zealand generally referred to as \"His/Her Honour\" or \"Sir/Madame.\" Judges from the High Court, Appeals Court, and Supreme Court are referred to as \"Justice [Surname].\" In social settings, it is appropriate to use \"Judge\" in all cases.\n\nIn Brazil, judges are simply called \"Juiz\" or \"Juíza\" (male and female forms of \"judge\") and traditionally addressed to as \"Vossa Excelência\" (lit. \"Your Excellency\", translated as \"Your Honor\") or \"Meritíssimo\" (lit. \"Honorable\", but it is used as a pronoun also translated as \"Your Honor\"). Judges that are part of a panel in a State Court, or Federal Court are called \"desembargadores\". Judges sitting in the higher courts (Supremo Tribunal Federal, Superior Tribunal de Justiça, Tribunal Superior do Trabalho, Superior Tribunal Militar and Tribunal Superior Eleitoral) are called \"ministro\" or \"ministra\" (male and female forms of \"minister\") and also referred to as \"Vossa Excelência\".\n\nAt the International Court of Justice, judges may be addressed by the titles they received in their countries of origin.\n\nJudges of the International Criminal Court are referred to as \"judge.\"\n\nThe Biblical Book of Judges revolves around a succession of leaders who were known as \"judges\" (Hebrew shoftim שופטים) but who – aside from their judicial function – were also tribal war leaders. The same word is, however, used in contemporary Israel to denote judges whose function and authority is similar to that in other modern countries. The same word is also used in modern Hebrew for referees in any kind of contest and in particular in sport. To distinguish them from judicial judges and from each other, the kind of the contest is added after the word \"shofet\" in the Construct state (e.g. \"shofet kaduregel\" שופט כדורגל, litteraly \"judge of soccer\").\n\n"}
{"id": "299920", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=299920", "title": "Legal formalism", "text": "Legal formalism\n\nLegal formalism is both a descriptive theory and a normative theory of how judges should decide cases. In its descriptive sense, formalists believe that judges should reach their decisions by applying uncontroversial principles to the facts. Although the large number of decided cases implies a large number of principles, formalists believe that there is an underlying logic to these principles that is straightforward and which legal experts can readily discover. The ultimate goal of formalism would be to formalise the underlying principles in a single and determinate system that could be applied mechanically (hence the label 'mechanical jurisprudence'). Formalism has been called 'the official theory of judging'. It is the thesis to which legal realism is the antithesis.\n\nAs a normative theory, formalism is the view that judges should decide cases by the application of uncontroversial principles to the facts.\n\nFormalism remains one of the most influential and important theories of adjudication and has been called the thesis to which realism is the antithesis. Formalism sees adjudication as the uncontroversial application of accepted principles to known facts to derive the outcome in the manner of a deductive syllogism.\n\nFormalists believe that the relevant principles of law of a given area can be discerned by surveying the case law of that area. Christopher Columbus Langdell believed that the only resources needed to create a science of law was a law library.\n\nFormalism has been called an 'autonomous discipline', in reference to the formalist belief that judges require only the facts and the law, all normative issues such as morality or politics being irrelevant. If judges are seen to be simply applying the rules in a mechanical and uncontroversial manner, this protects judges from criticism. For this reason, formalism has been called 'the official theory of judging'.\n\nFormalists, contrary to Realists, take the judge at face-value, assuming that the facts and principles as recorded in a judge's reasons reflect the facts that the judge considered to be relevant, and the principles that the judge arrived at to reach the judgement. They therefore place little emphasis on the means by which a judge determines the facts.\n\nAs a normative theory, legal formalists argue that judges and other public officials should be constrained in their interpretation of legal texts, suggesting that investing the judiciary with the power to say what the law \"should\" be, rather than confining them to expositing what the law \"does\" say, violates the separation of powers. This argument finds its most eloquent expression in the Massachusetts Constitution of 1780, which provides that the judiciary \"shall never exercise the legislative and executive powers, or either of them; to the end [that Massachusetts' government] may be a government of laws, and not of men\". Formalism seeks to maintain that separation as a \"theory that law is a set of rules and principles independent of other political and social institutions\".\n\nLegal formalism can be contrasted to legal instrumentalism, a view associated with American legal realism. Instrumentalism is the view that creativity in the interpretation of legal texts is justified in order to assure that the law serves good public policy and social interests, although legal instrumentalists could also see the end of law as the promotion of justice or the protection of human rights. Legal formalists counter that giving judges authority to change the law to serve their own ideas regarding policy undermines the rule of law. This tension is especially interesting in common law, which depend on judicial precedent. The \"claim to fame\" of common law systems is that the task of developing and updating law is best done incrementally by courts that keep in close touch with social, economic, and technological realities than by political organs that, every so often, will attend to legal reforms. Thus legal realism or \"relationalism\" has been favored in some common law jurisdictions, where the kind of legal codification associated with civil law are virtually unknown.\n\nThe late United States Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was noted for his formalist views about a variety of topics, particularly his view that the United States Constitution should be interpreted in accord with its original meaning and his view that statutes should be read in accord with their plain meaning.\n\nIn \"A Matter of Interpretation\", Scalia defended textualism — and, by extension, formalism — saying:\n\nScalia's strongest claim on Formalist credentials can be found in an essay entitled \"The Rule of Law as a Law of Rules\".\n\nFrederick Schauer, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, in 1988 published a law review article titled \"Formalism\" in \"The Yale Law Journal\". In it he urges scholars to rethink the \"contemporary aversion to formalism\" and states that his goal is to \"rescue formalism from conceptual banishment\". He argues formalism should be conceptually rethought, not in terms of merely whether it is a good or bad thing, but rather in terms of how language both can and should be used to restrict the power of decision-makers in the decision-making process.\n\nIn his essay \"Formal and informal in legal logic\", Jan Woleński contends that there are \"rhetorical functions of metalogical concepts that are used in legal discourse\", and hence the introduction of the informal into otherwise imperative logic. He reviews Jørgensen’s paradox to introduce deontic logic, and acknowledges this innovation by Georg Henrik von Wright.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "247409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=247409", "title": "Lien", "text": "Lien\n\nA lien ( or ) is a form of security interest granted over an item of property to secure the payment of a debt or performance of some other obligation. The owner of the property, who grants the lien, is referred to as the \"lienee\" and the person who has the benefit of the lien is referred to as the \"lienor\" or \"lien holder\".\n\nThe etymological root is Anglo-French \"lien\", \"loyen\" \"bond\", \"restraint\", from Latin \"ligamen\", from \"ligare\" \"to bind\".\n\nIn the United States, the term lien generally refers to a wide range of encumbrances and would include other forms of mortgage or charge. In the US, a lien characteristically refers to \"nonpossessory\" security interests (see generally: Security interest—categories).\n\nIn other common-law countries, the term lien refers to a very specific type of security interest, being a passive right to retain (but not sell) property until the debt or other obligation is discharged. In contrast to the usage of the term in the US, in other countries it refers to a purely \"possessory\" form of security interest; indeed, when possession of the property is lost, the lien is released. However, common-law countries also recognize a slightly anomalous form of security interest called an \"equitable lien\" which arises in certain rare instances.\n\nDespite their differences in terminology and application, there are a number of similarities between liens in the US and elsewhere in the common-law world.\n\nLiens can be consensual or non-consensual (also termed voluntary or involuntary in different states). Consensual liens are imposed by a contract between the creditor and the debtor:\n\n\nNonconsensual liens typically arise by statute or by the operation of the common law. Those laws give a creditor the right to impose a lien on an item of real property or a chattel by the existence of the relationship of creditor and debtor. Those liens include\n\n\nLiens are also \"perfected\" or \"unperfected\" (see perfection). Perfected liens are those liens for which a creditor has established a priority right in the encumbered property with respect to third party creditors. Perfection is generally accomplished by taking steps required by law to give third party creditors notice of the lien. The fact that an item of property is in the hands of the creditor usually constitutes perfection. Where the property remains in the hands of the debtor, some further step must be taken, like recording a notice of the security interest with the appropriate office.\n\nPerfecting a lien is an important part of the task of protecting the secured creditor's interest in the property. A perfected lien is valid against bona fide purchasers of property, and even against a trustee in bankruptcy; an unperfected lien may not be.\n\nIn the United States, references to an \"equitable lien\" is a right, enforceable only in equity, to have a demand satisfied out of a particular fund or specific property without having possession of the fund or property. An equitable lien is actually a legal remedy, rather than a security interest created in contemplation of or in support of a transaction. In U.S. law, such liens characteristically arise in four circumstances:\n\nMovers are typically entitled to a mover's lien under UCC § 7-307/308, to withhold a customer's goods to secure payment. This is a possessory lien, and is the non-consensual type of lien (because it exists automatically under a statute instead of being affirmatively agreed upon). However, the concept of a mover's lien is often abused in a moving scam known as a hostage load, whereby the moving company will fraudulently extort money not owed by the customer by refusing to deliver the goods unless the customer pays money inflated beyond the contractual estimate. Because the customer has an interest in obtaining their own goods, they are under duress to pay the ransom. Hostage loads in at least the interstate context are illegal under 49 U.S.C. 13905. The FMCSA regulates the moving industry and sometimes takes enforcement action by fining and/or delicensure of offending moving companies. Moving companies that deliberately engage in hostage-loading may also be considered to be engaging in racketeering in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.\n\nDisputes between legitimate lienholding of chattels vs. hostage-loading can sometimes be averted by the customer including an advanced (before-the-fact) consensual waiver of the mover's right to a lien in the written contract, obligating the moving company to deliver the goods with reasonable dispatch regardless of disputes over payment, and failure to do so would constitute conversion or trespass to chattels.\n\nOutside of the US, a common-law lien may be defined in general terms as a passive right to retain a chattel (and, in certain cases, documentary intangibles and papers) conferred by law. Modern law has generally left the legal lien to cases where it has been historically established without any real effort being made to make it applicable to modern conditions. In \"Tappenden v Artus\" [1964] 2 QB 185 Diplock LJ referred to a lien as a \"self help\" remedy, like \"other primitive remedies such as abatement of nuisance, self-defence or ejection of trespassers to land\". Equitable liens are an unusual species of property right, usually considered \"sui generis\".\n\nCommon-law liens are divided into \"special liens\" and \"general liens\". A special lien, the more common kind, requires a close connection between the property and the service rendered. A special lien can only be exercised in respect of fees relating to the instant transaction; the lienor cannot use the property held as security for past debts as well. A general lien affects all of the property of the lienee in the possession of the lienor, and stands as security for all of the debts of the lienee to the lienor. A special lien can be extended to a general lien by contract, and this is commonly done in the case of carriers. A common-law lien only gives a passive right to retain; there is no power of sale which arises at common law, although some statutes have also conferred an additional power of sale, and it is possible to confer a separate power of sale by contract.\n\nThe common-law liens are closely aligned to the so-called \"common callings\", but are not co-extensive with them.\n\nA common-law lien is a very limited type of security interest. Apart from the fact that it only amounts to a passive right to retain, a lien cannot be transferred; it cannot be asserted by a third party to whom possession of the goods is given to perform the same services that the original party should have performed; and if the chattel is surrendered to the lienor, the lien entitlement is lost forever (except for where the parties agree that the lien shall survive a temporary re-possession by the lienor). A lienee who sells the chattel unlawfully may be liable in conversion as well as surrendering the lien.\n\nIn common-law countries, equitable liens give rise to unique and difficult issues. An equitable lien is a nonpossessory security right conferred by operation of law, which is similar in effect to an equitable charge. It differs from a charge in that it is non-consensual. It is conferred only in very limited circumstances, the most common (and least ambiguous) of which is in relation to the sale of land; an unpaid vendor has an equitable lien over the land for the purchase price, notwithstanding that the purchaser has gone into occupation of the property. It is seen as a counterweight to the equitable rule which confers a beneficial interest in the land on the purchaser once contracts are exchanged for purchase.\n\nIt is a matter of conjecture how far equitable liens extend outside of the unpaid vendor's lien. Equitable liens have been held to exist in a number of cases involving choses in action, but not yet in relation to chattels. The Australian courts have been the most receptive towards equitable liens in relation to personal property (see \"Hewett v Court\" (1983) 57 ALJR 211, but a review of the cases still leaves a lack of clarity in relation to the principles upon which an equitable lien will be imposed.\nBut overall, there is still perceived to be a lack of central nexus.\n\nAlthough arguably not liens as such, two other forms of encumbrance are sometimes referred to as liens.\n\nCertain statutes provide for a passive right to retain property against its owner as security for obligations. For example, section 88 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982 of the United Kingdom permits an airport to detain aircraft for unpaid airport charges and aviation fuel. Although this right has been treated as a lien under UK insolvency law, it has been argued that such statutory rights are not in fact liens, but rights analogous to liens, although some might say that this is a distinction without a difference.\n\nIt has also been argued that an agreement by contract that one party may retain the goods of another party until paid is not a lien, as under the common law, liens could only be non-consensual. However, it appears that under insolvency law, such rights will be treated as liens even if they are not expressed to be liens.\n\nA maritime lien is a lien on a vessel, given to secure the claim of a creditor who provided maritime services to the vessel or who suffered an injury from the vessel's use. Maritime liens are sometimes referred to as \"tacit hypothecation\". Maritime liens have little in common with other liens under the laws of most jurisdictions.\n\nThe maritime lien has been described as \"one of the most striking peculiarities of Admiralty law\". A maritime lien constitutes a security interest upon ships of a nature otherwise unknown to the common law or equity. It arises purely by operation of law and exists as a claim upon the property concerned, both secret and invisible, often given priority by statute over other forms of registered security interest. Although characteristics vary under the laws of different countries, it can be described as:\n\nThroughout the world, there are a large number of different types and sub-divisions of liens. Not all of the following liens exist in all legal systems that recognise the concept of a lien. The following are descriptions that are not necessarily mutually exclusive.

{"id": "2844943", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2844943", "title": "Nonrecourse debt", "text": "Nonrecourse debt\n\nNonrecourse debt or a nonrecourse loan (sometimes hyphenated as non-recourse) is a secured loan (debt) that is secured by a pledge of collateral, typically real property, but for which the borrower is not personally liable. If the borrower defaults, the lender can seize and sell the collateral, but if the collateral sells for less than the debt, the lender cannot seek that deficiency balance from the borrower—its recovery is limited only to the value of the collateral. Thus, nonrecourse debt is typically limited to 50% or 60% loan-to-value ratios, so that the property itself provides \"overcollateralization\" of the loan.\n\nThe incentives for the parties are at an intermediate position between those of a full recourse secured loan and a totally unsecured loan. While the borrower is in first loss position, the lender also assumes significant risk, so the lender must underwrite the loan with much more care than in a full recourse loan. This typically requires that the lender have significant domain expertise and financial modeling expertise.\n\nIn Europe, mortgage loans secured by personal residences are usually recourse loans. Most states in the United States also permit recourse for residential mortgages, but antideficiency statutes in a minority of states require nonrecourse mortgages.\nAround 13 states can be classified as nonrecourse states, depending on a researcher's classification standards.\n\nSelf-directed IRA investors who choose to purchase investment real estate are able to leverage their purchase with a nonrecourse loan. Due to Internal Revenue Service regulations, it would be deemed a violation of the qualified retirement account status to personally guarantee any loan on real estate owned by a self-directed IRA.\n\nA Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) loan, used by some states to fund residential energy improvements, is an example of a loan that is nonrecourse to the borrower.\n\nNonrecourse debt is typically used to finance commercial real estate, shipping, or other projects with high capital expenditures, long loan periods, and uncertain revenue streams. It is also commonly used for stock loans and other securities-collateralized lending structures. Since most commercial real estate is owned in a partnership structure (or similar tax pass-through), nonrecourse borrowing gives the real estate owner the tax benefits of a tax-pass-through partnership structure (that is, loss pass-through and no double taxation), and simultaneously limits personal liability to the value of the investment. A nonrecourse debt of $30 billion was issued to JPMorgan Chase by the Federal Reserve in order to purchase Bear Stearns on March 16, 2008. The nonrecourse loan was issued with Bear Stearns's less liquid assets as collateral, meaning that the Federal Reserve will absorb the loss should the value of those assets be below their collateralized value.\n\nThe legal financing industry provides nonrecourse financial products used to provide financial assistance to plaintiffs involved in a contingency-based lawsuit like a car accident. The funds are provided to the consumer on the potential settlement amount. This money is true nonrecourse funding, if the case is lost, one does not owe the company funding the lawsuit anything. This is a purchase of an asset and not a loan.\n\nNonrecourse debt is usually carried on a debtor company's balance sheet as a liability, and the collateral is carried as an asset. For U.S. Federal income tax purposes, the interaction among the concepts of (1) the \"amount realized\" upon a disposition, (2) the amount of nonrecourse debt, and (3) the amount of adjusted basis in the property is fairly complex. The tax consequences of a disposition depend on whether the taxpayer acquired the property with the nonrecourse debt already attached, or whether the taxpayer took out the nonrecourse debt after acquisition of the property, and the relative relationships between fair market value and purchase price and disposition price. Upon a sale or other disposition of property under U.S. income tax law, a taxable gain generally results where the amount realized upon the sale or other disposition of property exceeds the amount of the taxpayer's adjusted basis in that property.\nGenerally, the amount realized is the amount of cash and other consideration received by the taxpayer. The amount of any loan forgiven or discharged is generally part of that consideration.\n\nThe adjusted basis is the sum of the following:\n\nIf the amount realized exceeds the amount of adjusted basis, the taxpayer has realized a gain at the time of disposition. If the adjusted basis exceeds the amount realized, a loss has been incurred. The federal income tax effect of nonrecourse debt may be explained by first considering the tax effect of a disposition involving recourse debt (that is, a debt in which the property provides first security coverage, and the borrower/taxpayer is personally liable for any deficiency that may remain after the lender forecloses against the property), and then contrasting against similar facts involving nonrecourse debt, as follows:\n\nAs an example, suppose: \n\nAssuming that the creditor forecloses on the property and that the $20,000 excess of the debt over the property's fair market value ($100,000 less $80,000) is contractually discharged (for didactic symmetry with the nonrecourse example, let's assume, contrary to the commercial point of a recourse loan, that the debt is outright forgiven by the creditor, with no actual payment), the taxpayer would realize the $20,000 amount as income from the discharge of indebtedness. That $20,000 of forgiveness would be taxable to the taxpayer as ordinary income even though the taxpayer received no cash at the time of the discharge. The $35,000 excess of the fair market value over the adjusted basis ($80,000 less $45,000) would be treated as a taxable capital gain on the \"sale or other disposition\" of the property—again, even though the taxpayer received no cash at the time of the foreclosure.\n\nAssuming the same facts except that the debt is nonrecourse, the result would be quite different. The taxpayer would realize zero taxable ordinary income from the discharge of debt. Instead, the entire $55,000 difference between the unpaid principal of the debt and the taxpayer's adjusted basis ($100,000 less $45,000) would be treated as a taxable capital gain on the \"sale or other disposition\" of the property—again, even though no cash is received by the taxpayer at the time of foreclosure.\n\nAt the sale, foreclosure or other disposition, nonrecourse debt incurred as part of the financing of the acquisition, and money extracted from an investment by mortgaging out, are treated the same: both are taxable realization only at the time of the property's disposition, even if, at time of disposition, the property is worth less than the amount of the mortgage. Nonrecourse debt that is in place at the time of acquisition of the property is included in basis, \"Crane v. Commissioner\", subsequent borrowing is not. \"Woodsam Associates, Inc. v. Commissioner\". Subsequent borrowing proceeds reinvested in a depreciable property thereby avoid \"Woodsam\" and take advantage of \"Crane\".\n\n"}

In less precise usage, it can refer either to prices obtained by practices inconsistent with a competitive free market, or to windfall profits. In the former Soviet Union, it was simply included under the single definition of speculation.\n\nThe term is similar to profiteering but can be distinguished by being short-term and localized, and by a restriction to essentials such as food, clothing, shelter, medicine and equipment needed to preserve life, limb and property. In jurisdictions where there is no such crime, the term may still be used to pressure firms to refrain from such behavior.\n\nThe term is not in widespread use in mainstream economic theory, but is sometimes used to refer to practices of a coercive monopoly which raises prices above the market rate that would otherwise prevail in a competitive environment. Alternatively, it may refer to suppliers' benefiting to excess from a short-term change in the demand curve.\n\nAs a criminal offense, Florida's \"state of emergency\" law is an example. Price gouging may be charged when a supplier of essential goods or services sharply raises the prices asked in anticipation of or during a civil emergency, or when it cancels or dishonors contracts in order to take advantage of an increase in prices related to such an emergency. The model case is a retailer who increases the price of existing stocks of milk and bread when a hurricane is imminent.\n\nIn Florida, it is a defense to show that the price increase mostly reflects increased costs, such as running an emergency generator, or hazard pay for workers, while California places a ten percent cap on any increases.\n\nIn the United States, laws against price gouging have been held constitutional at the state level as a valid exercise of the police power to preserve order during an emergency, and may be combined with anti-hoarding measures. Exceptions are prescribed for price increases that can be justified in terms of increased cost of supply, transportation, demand or storage. Statutes generally give wide discretion not to prosecute: in 2004, Florida determined that one-third of complaints were unfounded, and a large fraction of the remainder was handled by consent decrees, rather than prosecution. As of 2008, laws against price-gouging have been enacted in 35 states. Price-gouging is often defined in terms of three criteria listed below:\n\n\nEconomists Thomas Sowell and Walter E. Williams, among others, argue against laws that interfere with large or exorbitant price changes. According to this view, high prices can be viewed as information for use in determining the best allocation of scarce resources for which there are multiple uses. Many libertarian economists oppose price gouging legislation and argue that it prevents goods from going to individuals who value them the most and not just to those with the greatest wealth. For example, after a storm has felled numerous trees in a locality, advocates of this theory claim that a rise in the price of chain saws will discourage their purchase by people with only a minor need for them, making them more available for those with the strongest need, rather than the most wealth. Problems during the Siege of Paris (1870–1871), which critics attribute to price restrictions, are often held up as another example. With price gouging laws in place, producers are only able to charge a price set by law, and therefore have little additional incentive to increase supply to adversely impacted areas. If producers are able to make extra profit, these theorists argue, then they will increase the supply. It is claimed that these laws lead to after-market operations as consumers with the lowest opportunity costs buy up desired resources and attempt to resell them to public at higher prices.\n\nCritics claim that laws against price-gouging could discourage businesses from proactively preparing for a disaster. One example given in support of this view is that a business could install an expensive emergency power system for power outages. However, if it is prohibited from large price increases, the costs cannot be recovered during the relatively short amount of time when there is no power. As a result, a business that proactively prepared could not compete with others that did not. (This is generally unnecessary for similar businesses in close proximity to one another.) According to this theory, the end result would be needless shortages and more hardship for the public, or under extreme circumstances, it could be deadly. To correct the situation, those opposed to price gouging laws argue that if not abolished entirely, laws would have to be amended to allow the amortization of equipment that is useful \"only\" during a disaster. Unlike amortizing for tax purposes, this would account for how equipment is sporadically paid off internally with the extra revenue.\n\nIn support of the argument against price-gouging legislation, some assert that a similar situation applies to those who are outside of the disaster zone and willing to go there to sell what is desperately needed. If they are unable to recover their travel costs and be compensated for the inconvenience of staying in an inhospitable disaster zone, only the altruistic few would bother to do so. Since most anti-price gouging laws are based on the pre-disaster selling price, a person who buys needed supplies at the retail level in an unaffected area will more easily run afoul of the law than a large wholesaler would. They assert that it would be the \"little guy\" who could lose more on a percentage basis, in addition to the possibility of hefty fines, rather than \"big business.\"\n\nOpponents of anti-price gouging laws also claim that in terms of fairness, such laws could also require producers to sell goods below their market-clearing price: the market clearing price is the amount at which quantity supplied is equal to quantity demanded. According to this theory, if goods are priced above their market-clearing price then there will be a surplus of goods, and the converse leads to a shortage of goods. Thus, advocates of this theory claim that consumers would be unable to buy the necessary goods which they desire in a time of need.\n\nAccording to the theory of neoclassical economics, anti-price gouging laws prevent allocative efficiency. Allocative efficiency refers to when prices function properly, markets tend to allocate resources to their most valued uses. In turn those who value the good the most (and not just the wealthiest) will be willing to pay a higher price than those who do not value the good as much. According to Friedrich Hayek in \"The Use of Knowledge in Society\", prices can act to coordinate the separate actions of different people as they seek to satisfy their desires.\n\n\n"}

Safe conduct is only granted in exceptional circumstances.

An example of safe conduct in the 20th century was Lenin's \"sealed train\": a citizen of Russia, a country at war with Germany, Lenin was permitted to travel from his exile in Switzerland through Germany, without stopping, to return to Russia. It was in Germany's interest to allow this, for it was hoped that he would destabilize Russia. Another example would be the Chieu Hoi program during the Vietnam War.\n"}
{"id": "16909251", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16909251", "title": "Say on pay", "text": "Say on pay\n\nSay on pay is a term used for a role in corporate law whereby a firm's shareholders have the right to vote on the remuneration of executives.\n\nOften described in corporate governance or management theory as an agency problem, a corporation's managers are likely to overpay themselves because, directly or indirectly, they are allowed to pay themselves as a matter of general management power. Directors are elected to a board that has a fiduciary duty to protect the interests of the corporation. In large listed companies, executive compensation will usually be determined by a compensation committee composed of board members. Proponents argue that “say on pay” reforms strengthen the relationship between the board of directors and shareholders, ensuring that board members fulfill their fiduciary duty. Critics of the policy believe that “say on pay” does not effectively or comprehensibly monitor compensation, and consider it to be reactionary policy rather than proactive policy, because it does not immediately affect the Board of Directors. Some argue it is counter-productive because it diminishes the authority of the Board of Directors. The effect of ‘say on pay’ measures can be binding or non-binding, depending on regulatory requirements or internal corporate policy as determined by proxy votes.\n\nOn the 3rd of March the Swiss voted by 69.7 per cent to ensure shareholders, pension funds and not banks, entirely control questions of executive pay. Shareholders must elect all members of a company's remuneration committee of all Swiss public listed companies. They further should receive annual votes on the identity of all members of the board of directors. The role that banks played in casting votes on other shareholders behalf has been abolished.\n\nThe Corporations Amendment (Improving Accountability on Director and Executive Remuneration) Act 2011 introduced in the Corporations Act 2001 new sections 250R(2), 250U-V, so that if at two consecutive meetings over 25% of shareholders vote against the directors’ remuneration package, the directors have to stand for election again in 90 days.\n\nOriginally UK company law set a default rule that the remuneration of directors was to be set, binding, by the company's general meeting, under Table A, article 54, attached to the Companies Act 1862. Over time more and more companies gave the right to directors, which is the position found in the Model Articles for companies today, that remuneration of the directors shall be determined by the directors.\n\nThe United Kingdom was the forerunner in mandating that shareholders be allowed a \"non-binding\", or advisory vote on pay. In the UK, section 439 of the Companies Act 2006 mandates a vote on director pay at the yearly accounts meeting. Directors are expected to have disclosed their remuneration package in a \"Remuneration Report\" (section 420). Failure to do this leads to fines.\n\nIn addition, UK law regulates more tightly a number of elements beyond basic director pay. Employee share schemes that directors have must be approved by ordinary resolution under the London Stock Exchange Listing Rule 9.4.1. Under the UK Corporate Governance Code, with which all listed companies must comply or explain why they do not, a binding vote on approval of long-term incentive plans is recommended. Under section 188 of the Companies Act 2006 a shareholder resolution is necessary to approve a director’s contract lasting more than a 2-year term (reduced from approval beyond a 5-year term under the old Companies Act 1985, section 319). Lastly, frivolous categories of compensation are limited under section 215, by prohibiting payments for loss of office (i.e. no golden parachutes), except, under section 220, in respect of damages for existing obligations and pensions.\n\nAlthough the say on pay provision in section 439 is not binding on the board, the message in UK law is influential, because company members have an unrestricted right to fire any director, with reasonable notice, under section 168. The debate, however, moved on to whether the vote should become binding. Changes were introduced in the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013 section 79 to make the overall policy of pay be capable of being rejected by shareholders, but that no specific right to determine the amount has yet been introduced.\n\nIn the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act §951, a new say on pay provision was introduced. \n\nThere had been several recent efforts to require Say on Pay resolutions in the United States. In 2007, the Chairman of the Financial Services Committee Rep. Barney Frank sponsored legislation that was passed by the House of Representatives, giving shareholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation. Then Senator Barack Obama authored a \"Say on Pay\" proposal, but his legislation stalled in the Senate. \n\nThe economic crisis has affected corporate governance in the United States of America. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA), which established the Troubled Asset Relief Program, required say on pay resolutions at companies with outstanding funds from the TARP. In the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Senator Chris Dodd amended Section 111 of the EESA, and updated policy on Executive Compensation in Section 7. The amended legislation continued the \"Say on Pay\" policy established originally in the EESA.\n\nOn February 4, 2009, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner stated that companies that have received exceptional financial recovery assistance from the TARP fund would have to subject executive compensation to \"Say on Pay\" resolutions. On June 10, 2009, Secretary Geithner stated that the Administration supports \"Say on Pay\" legislation, and it would authorize the SEC authority to implement \"Say on Pay\" regulations at all companies, not only those that have outstanding funds from the TARP, contingent on Congressional approval. Additionally, the Treasury reconciled its proposals from February 4 with Congressional amendments to the EESA in the Final Interim Rule on TARP Standards for Compensation and Corporate Governance.\n\nOn July 31, 2009, H.R. 3269, the \"Corporate and Financial Institution Compensation Fairness Act of 2009\" passed the House of Representatives. The House bill included a section that allowed for a 'say on pay' for all public institutions in the United States. Additionally, it had a provision for a shareholder vote on golden parachutes. In the Senate, Senator Charles Schumer had introduced the Shareholder Bill of Rights. The House and Senate bills were reconciled in a final bill that was signed by President Obama on July 21, 2010 called The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.\n\nIn 2012, only 2.6% of companies which voted on say on pay measures failed to pass them.\n\nThe European Union has remained tentative about harmonising rules on CEO pay. In the High Level Group of Company Law Experts' \"Final Report\" in 2002, they stated they would not wish to impose a requirement for voting EU wide, yet.\n\n\"Some Member States require, or are considering requiring, a form of mandatory or advisory vote by \nshareholders on the remuneration policy. We do not believe a shareholder vote on the remuneration policy generally should be an \nEU requirement, as the effects of such a vote can be different from Member State to Member State. The important thing is that \nshareholders annually have the opportunity to debate the policy with the board.\n\nHowever, a different approach is taken to share schemes, which were recommended to be more closely scrutinised.\n\nThe Coalition Government of Germany has recently passed reforming legislation to the Stock Corporation Act to introduce a non-binding say on pay.\n\nIncidents at large UK companies in which shareholders have \"revolted\" against the size of pay awards given to board members, since the \"say on pay\" legislation was introduced.\n\n\nIn the first year of mandatory shareholder advisory \"say on pay\" voting in the US, 37 Russell 3000 companies failed to receive majority support from shareholders. In the second year of voting, 44 Russell 3000 companies have failed as of June 12, 2012. Companies include:\n\n\nBrian Cheffins of Cambridge University and Randall Thomas of Vanderbilt University predicted that a 'say on pay' could hold back sudden jumps, but it would not stop the general upward drift in pay rates. Ryan Krause and colleagues argued that 'say on pay' offered little information to the board of directors beyond disapproval of CEO compensation not being in line with firm performance.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "43530", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43530", "title": "Schist", "text": "Schist\n\nSchist (pronounced ) is a medium-grade metamorphic rock. Schist has medium to large, flat, sheet-like grains in a preferred orientation (nearby grains are roughly parallel). It is defined by having more than 50% platy and elongated minerals (such as micas or talc), often finely interleaved with quartz and feldspar. These lamellar (flat, planar) minerals include micas, chlorite, talc, hornblende, graphite, and others. Quartz often occurs in drawn-out grains to such an extent that a particular form called quartz schist is produced. Schist is often garnetiferous. Schist forms at a higher temperature and has larger grains than phyllite. Geological foliation (metamorphic arrangement in layers) with medium to large grained flakes in a preferred sheetlike orientation is called \"schistosity\".\n\nThe names of various schists are derived from their mineral constituents. For example, schists primarily composed of biotite and muscovite are called mica schists. Most schists are mica schists, but graphite and chlorite schists are also common. Schists are also named for their prominent or perhaps unusual mineral constituents, as in the case of garnet schist, tourmaline schist, and glaucophane schist.\n\nThe individual mineral grains in schist, drawn out into flaky scales by heat and pressure, can be seen with the naked eye. Schist is characteristically \"foliated\", meaning that the individual mineral grains split off easily into flakes or slabs. The word schist is derived ultimately from the Greek word \"σχίζειν\" (\"schízein\") meaning \"to split\", which is a reference to the ease with which schists can be split along the plane in which the platy minerals lie.\n\nMost schists are derived from clays and muds that have passed through a series of metamorphic processes involving the production of shales, slates and phyllites as intermediate steps. Certain schists are derived from fine-grained igneous rocks such as basalts and tuffs.\n\nBefore the mid-18th century, the terms slate, shale and schist were not sharply differentiated by those involved with mining. In the context of underground coal mining, shale was frequently referred to as slate well into the 20th century.\n\nDuring metamorphism, rocks which were originally sedimentary, igneous or metamorphic are converted into schists and gneisses. If the composition of the rocks was originally similar, they may be very difficult to distinguish from one another if the metamorphism has been great. A quartz-porphyry, for example, and a fine grained feldspathic sandstone, may both be converted into a grey or pink mica-schist. Usually, however, it is possible to distinguish between sedimentary and igneous schists and gneisses. If, for example, the whole district occupied by these rocks has traces of bedding, clastic structure, or unconformability, then it may be a sign that the original rock was sedimentary. In other cases intrusive junctions, chilled edges, contact alteration or porphyritic structure may prove that in its original condition a metamorphic gneiss was an igneous rock. The last appeal is often to the chemistry, for there are certain rock types which occur only as sediments, while others are found only among igneous masses, and however advanced the metamorphism may be, it rarely modifies the chemical composition of the mass very greatly. Such rocks as limestones, dolomites, quartzites and aluminous shales have very definite chemical characteristics which distinguish them even when completely recrystallized.\n\nThe schists are classified principally according to the minerals they consist of and on their chemical composition. For example, many metamorphic limestones, marbles, and calc-schists, with crystalline dolomites, contain silicate minerals such as mica, tremolite, diopside, scapolite, quartz and feldspar. They are derived from calcareous sediments of different degrees of purity. Another group is rich in quartz (quartzites, quartz schists and quartzose gneisses), with variable amounts of white and black mica, garnet, feldspar, zoisite and hornblende. These were once sandstones and arenaceous rocks. The graphitic schists may readily be believed to represent sediments once containing coal or plant remains; there are also schistose ironstones (hematite-schists), but metamorphic beds of salt or gypsum are exceedingly uncommon. Among schists of igneous origin there are the silky calc-schists, the foliated serpentines (once ultramafic masses rich in olivine), and the white mica-schists, porphyroids and banded halleflintas, which have been derived from rhyolites, quartz-porphyries and felsic tuffs. The majority of mica-schists, however, are altered claystones and shales, and pass into the normal sedimentary rocks through various types of phyllite and mica-slates. They are among the most common metamorphic rocks; some of them are graphitic and others calcareous. The diversity in appearance and composition is very great, but they form a well-defined group not difficult to recognize, from the abundance of black and white micas and their thin, foliated, schistose character. A subgroup is the andalusite-, staurolite-, kyanite- and sillimanite-schists which usually make their appearance in the vicinity of gneissose granites, and have presumably been affected by contact metamorphism.\n\nIn geotechnical engineering a schistosity plane often forms a discontinuity that may have a large influence on the mechanical behavior (strength, deformation, etc.) of rock masses in, for example, tunnel, foundation, or slope construction.\n\n\n"}

An example would be a potential juror in a murder case, where the sentencing options include the death penalty and a lesser sentence (such as life without parole), who states that s/he \"would sentence a defendant to death if found guilty\"; such a statement may indicate the person's unwillingness to fairly consider a life without parole sentence.\n\nUnlike a peremptory challenge (the number of which are limited by the court during voir dire, and unless a Batson challenge is raised the challenge is automatically granted) there is no limit to the number of strikes for cause that attorneys on either side of a case can be granted. However, also unlike a peremptory challenge, a strike for cause must state a specific reason (in the example above, the reason would be the juror's bias against a non-death penalty sentence) and be granted by the trial judge; often both attorneys and sometimes the judge will question the juror being challenged.\n\nIf one attorney moves to strike a juror for cause but the judge rejects the motion, the attorney may still use a peremptory challenge (if s/he has any remaining) to strike the juror, and on appeal may raise a claim that the motion should have been granted but, because it was not, the attorney had to either use a peremptory challenge or seat a biased juror.\n"}

It was inspired by the work of former Stanford, now Harvard, law professor Lawrence Lessig, who wrote the book \"Free Culture\", and it frequently collaborates with other prominent free culture NGOs, including Creative Commons, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and Public Knowledge. Students for Free Culture has over 30 chapters on college campuses around the world, and a history of grassroots activism.\n\nStudents for Free Culture is sometimes referred to as \"FreeCulture\", \"the Free Culture Movement\", and other variations on the \"free culture\" theme, but none of those are its official name. It is officially Students for Free Culture, as set for in the new bylaws that were ratified by its chapters on October 1, 2007, which changed its name from FreeCulture.org to Students for Free Culture.\n\nStudents for Free Culture has stated its goals in a \"manifesto\": \nThe mission of the Free Culture movement is to build a bottom-up, participatory structure to society and culture, rather than a top-down, closed, proprietary structure. Through the democratizing power of digital technology and the Internet, we can place the tools of creation and distribution, communication and collaboration, teaching and learning into the hands of the common person -- and with a truly active, connected, informed citizenry, injustice and oppression will slowly but surely vanish from the earth.\nIt has yet to publish a more \"official\" mission statement, but some of its goals are:\n\nAccording to its website, Students for Free Culture has four main functions within the free culture movement:\n\nStudents for Free Culture had its origins in the Swarthmore Coalition for the Digital Commons (SCDC), a student group at Swarthmore College. The SCDC was founded in 2003 by students Luke Smith and Nelson Pavlosky, and was originally focused on issues related to free software, digital restrictions management, and treacherous computing, inspired largely by the Free Software Foundation. After watching Lawrence Lessig's OSCON 2002 speech entitled \"free culture\" however, they expanded the club's scope to cover cultural participation in general (rather than just in the world of software and computers), and began tackling issues such as copyright reform. In September 2004, SCDC was renamed Free Culture Swarthmore, laying the groundwork for Students for Free Culture and making it the first existing chapter.\n\nWithin a couple of months of founding the SCDC, Smith and Pavlosky became embroiled in the controversy surrounding Diebold Election Systems (now Premier Election Solutions), a voting machine manufacturer accused of making bug-ridden and insecure electronic voting machines. The SCDC had been concerned about electronic voting machines using proprietary software rather than open source software, and kept an eye on the situation. Their alarm grew when a copy of Diebold's internal e-mail archives leaked onto the Internet, revealing questionable practices at Diebold and possible flaws with Diebold's machines, and they were spurred into action when Diebold began sending legal threats to voting activists who posted the e-mails on their websites. Diebold was claiming that the e-mails were their copyrighted material, and that anyone who posted these e-mails online was infringing upon their intellectual property. The SCDC posted the e-mail archive on its website and prepared for the inevitable legal threats.\n\nDiebold sent notices under the DMCA to the SCDC's ISP, Swarthmore College. Swarthmore took down the SCDC website, and the SCDC co-founders sought legal representation. They contacted the Electronic Frontier Foundation for help, and discovered that they had an opportunity to sign on to an existing lawsuit against Diebold, OPG v. Diebold, with co-plaintiffs from a non-profit ISP called the Online Policy Group who had also received legal threats from Diebold. With pro bono legal representation from EFF and the Stanford Cyberlaw Clinic, they sued Diebold for abusing copyright law to suppress freedom of speech online. After a year of legal battles, the judge ruled that posting the e-mails online was a fair use, and that Diebold had violated the DMCA by misrepresenting their copyright claims over the e-mails.\n\nThe network of contacts that Smith and Pavlosky built during the lawsuit, including dozens of students around the country who had also hosted the Diebold memos on their websites, gave them momentum they needed to found an international student movement based on the same free culture principles as the SCDC. They purchased the domain name Freeculture.org and began building a website, while contacting student activists at other schools who could help them start the organization.\n\nOn April 23, 2004, Smith and Pavlosky announced the official launch of FreeCulture.org, in an event at Swarthmore College featuring Lawrence Lessig as the keynote speaker (Lessig had released his book Free Culture less than a month beforehand.) The SCDC became the first Freeculture.org chapter (beginning the process of changing its name to Free Culture Swarthmore), and students from other schools in the area who attended the launch went on to found chapters on their campuses, including Bryn Mawr College and Franklin and Marshall.\n\nFreeCulture.org began by launching a number of internet campaigns, in an attempt to raise its profile and bring itself to the attention of college students. These have covered issues ranging from defending artistic freedom (Barbie in a Blender) to fighting the Induce Act (Save The iPod), from celebrating Creative Commons licenses and the public domain (Undead Art) to opposing business method patents (Cereal Solidarity). While these one-shot websites succeeded in attracting attention from the press and encouraged students to get involved, they didn't directly help the local chapters, and the organization now concentrates less on web campaigns than it did in the past. However, their recent Down With DRM video contest was a successful \"viral video\" campaign against DRM, and internet campaigns remain an important tool in free culture activism.\n\nToday the organization focuses on providing services to its local campus chapters, including web services such as mailing lists and wikis, pamphlets and materials for tabling, and organizing conferences where chapter members can meet up. Active chapters are located at schools such as New York University (NYU), Harvard, MIT, Fordham Law, Dartmouth, University of Florida, Swarthmore, USC, Emory, Reed, and Yale.\n\nThe NYU chapter made headlines when it began protesting outside of record stores against DRM on CDs during the Sony rootkit scandal, resulting in similar protests around New York and Philadelphia.\n\nIn 2008, the MIT chapter developed and released YouTomb, a website to track videos removed by DMCA takedown from YouTube.\n\nOther activities at local chapters include:\n\nStudents for Free Culture began as a loose confederation of student groups on different campuses, but it has been moving towards becoming an official tax-exempt non-profit.\n\nWith the passage of official bylaws, Students for Free Culture now has a clear governance structure which makes it accountable to its chapters. The supreme decision-making body is the Board of Directors, which is elected once a year by the chapters, using a Schulze method for voting. It is meant to make long-term, high-level decisions, and should not meddle excessively in lower-level decisions. Practical everyday decisions will be made by the Core team, composed of any students who are members of chapters and meet the attendance requirements. Really low-level decisions and minutiae will be handled by a coordinator, who ideally will be a paid employee of the organization, and other volunteers and assistants. A new board of directors was elected in February 2008, and a new Core Team was assembled shortly thereafter. There is no coordinator yet.\n\n"}

The cause of action alleged a trespass upon person or property \"vi et armis\", Latin for \"by force and arms.\" The plaintiff would allege in a pleading that the act committing the offense was \"immediately injurious to another's property, and therefore necessarily accompanied by some degree of force; and by special action \"on the case\", where the act is in itself indifferent and the injury only consequential, and therefore arising without any breach of the peace.\" Thus it was \"immaterial whether the injury was committed willfully or not.\"\n\nIn \"Taylor v.

The defendant was held to be liable for medical bills as well as lost earnings as a result of the disability. Thus, proof that the act or omission was unintended was no defense to an action of trespass \"vi et armis\" and the liable party would pay for all consequent damages.\n\nRecovery for damages for a trespass \"vi et armis\" were limited only to the direct consequences of the act or omission causing the injury. For instance, the state of West Virginia reported that monetary loss for detention from business as an indirect result of the injury were not recoverable under an action for trespass \"vi et armis\", but were available under the related action of trespass on the case, also known as an action \"ex delicto\" \"against the wrong.\" \n\nTrespass \"vi et armis\" was a precursor to many other forms of lawsuits at common law. The cause came to be formulaic and in many cases fictitious. For instance, a lawsuit against a defendant had spoiled wine with salt water required an allegation that he had done so with bows and arrows. The ancient courts at common law developed trespass upon the case as an alternative pleading to causes of action which arose neither from force nor weapons. In modern times, the specific formalities of the distinction between the two have dropped in favor of notice pleading or code pleading and actions for negligence, battery, trespass to chattels, and conversion. \nThe related phrase of contra pacem regis, \"against the King's peace\", was necessarily not a required element of trespass \"vi et armis\" although it was possible for both allegations to appear in a lawsuit when the intentional use of force or weapons breached the peace.\n"}
{"id": "27866041", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27866041", "title": "Yasser Al-Habib", "text": "Yasser Al-Habib\n\nSheikh Yasser al-Habib (Arabic: ياسر الحبيب born 20 January 1979) is a Muslim Shia cleric, the founder and the head of the London-based Khoddam Al-Mahdi Organization, as well as Al-Muhassin mosque in Fulmer, Buckinghamshire. Al-Habib attempts to express his religious views and his investigations and conclusions in the Islamic history, based upon Shia and allegedly Sunni sources. \n\nAl-Habib started his religious activities in Kuwait, starting off as a member of the Dawah Party, later he founded a non-profit religious organization named Khoddam Al-Mahdi Organization, and he also expressed his religious views regarding Abu Bakr and Umar, and criticized them sharply, which led to anger the mainstream Sunnis in Kuwait and other Arabic-speaking Sunni communities, and finally led to the arrest of Al-Habib. Later, in February 2004 he was released under an annual pardon announced by the Amir of Kuwait on the occasion of the country's National Day, but his rearrest was ordered a few days later. Al-Habib fled Kuwait before he was sentenced \"in absentia\" to 10 years' imprisonment, and spent months in Iraq and Iran before gaining an asylum in United Kingdom which is his current place of residence.\n\nAl-Habib was interviewed by Elaph, a well-known Arabic online newspaper, where he stated that he was born in a religious Kuwaiti family, and started his education in the Kuwaiti governmental schools, before joining Kuwait University and graduating from its Political sciences faculty. Besides his secular studies, Al-Habib stated that he studied the traditional Islamic under the guidance of his teacher Ayatollah Mohammed Reza Shirazi.\n\nIn 2011, he founded Khoddam Al-Mahdi Organization at Kuwait and In 2003, Al-Habib was sentenced to 35 years in prison in Kuwait for insulting Aisha and Sunni caliphs, who are revered in Sunni Islam. However, his imprisonment was cut short in 2004 on the occasion of the country's National Day, but his rearrest was ordered a few days later. He fled the country first to Iraq, then to Iran. Then he went to London where Seyed Mojtaba Hosseini Shirazi, younger brother of Sadiq Shirazi, has lived for forty years. Finally he could get asylum in Britain.\n\nNow he lives in Fulmer, Buckinghamshire, and had started his religious and political activity such as founding Al Muhassin Mosque and setting up Fadak (TV channel).\n\nHe recorded two lectures in English titled: \"Who killed the Prophet Muhammad\" and \"Why do Shiites hate Umar Ibn al-Khattab\".\nSunni Al-Sha'ab newspaper described Sheikh al-Habib as a traitor and apostate in its main page, at the time that Al-Habib cursed Abu Bakr and Umar.\n\nAl-Habib said: \n\nSheikh al-Habib refers to Sunnis as Bakris, meaning the followers of Abu Bakr. He says that the real Sunnis (\"Ahlul Sunnah\") are the ones who follow the Sunnah of Muhammad, that is Shia Muslims. He continues that Sunnis today follow the Sunnah and teachings of Abu Bakr instead, having rejected Ali ibn Abi Talib and Ahlulbayt. He explains in one of his lectures titled \"Bakris think they are Sunnis, but in reality are not\" that when people wanted to distance themselves from the Shia, and follow Muawiyya, they started calling themselves the Jama'ah. He explains that the reality behind why people called themselves Ahlul Sunnah wal Jama'ah only began after the Umayyad ruler Umar bin Abdul Aziz forbade the Sunnah (tradition) of cursing Ali bin Abi Talib publicly (as previously invented by the Muawiyah). It was upon then that people protested to this new prohibition, declaring that Umar bin Abdul Aziz had prohibited the Sunnah of cursing Ali bin Abi Talib. Thus they began calling themselves Ahlul Sunnah wal Jama'ah; stressing that they adhere to the Sunnah of cursing Ali bin Abi Talib, and that they are the Jama'ah of Muawiyah.\n\nHe also refers to those personalities who claim that they belong to Shi'a but reconcile with the Sunni sect as Batris.\n\nHe described Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah (the Lebanese marja who died on 4 July 2010) as Batri. Al-Habib said that Fadlallah left a great number of doctrinal deviations, ignorant views and bad conduct which he introduced to the religion of Islam.\n\nIn September 2010 Sheikh Yasser al-Habib angered the Sunni Muslims by calling Aisha, \"an enemy of God\" which led Kuwait to revoke his citizenship accusing him of trying to stir up discord among Muslims.\n\nIn October 2010 Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei tried to calm tensions between Shias and Sunnis by issuing a fatwa against insulting Muhammad's companions and wives. \nAfter Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei issued the fatwa outlawing the insult of Sunni Dignitaries (Aisha, Abu Bakr and Umar ibn al-Khattāb), Al-Habib responded by calling the Islamic Republic of Iran \"oppressive\". He continued by referring to Khamenei as \"so-called Ali al-Khamenei – who pretends to be a Shia scholar\". His reasoning for naming the Iranian government as \"oppressive\" was because the \"regime in Iran today unjustly arrests anyone who celebrates the occasion of Farhat-ul-Zahra and prevents people from visiting the tomb of Abu Lulu\".\n\nSenior Iranian cleric Naser Makarem Shirazi has referred to Al-Habib as a \"hired agent or a mad man\" and stated: \"Recently an illiterate fool non clergy U.K citizen in the name of Shia has insulted sacred matters of Sunni Muslim brothers\".\n\nAl-Habib has been criticized by several figures and leaders who speak in the name of Shiism including Ammar Nakshawani, leader of Hezbollah Hassan Nasrallah, Ali Khamenei (who also issued a fatwa against cursing of Muhammad's companions) and Naser Makarem Shirazi.\n\nSheikh maintains that all he does is teach the Islam as it was and should be, something that was historically disorded by Sunnis and Iran since 1979, especially under the Khamenei.\n\n"}
