{"id": "24695089", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24695089", "title": "Accurate News and Information Act", "text": "Accurate News and Information Act\n\nThe Accurate News and Information Act was a statute passed by the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, Canada, in 1937, at the instigation of William Aberhart's Social Credit government. It would have required newspapers to print \"clarifications\" of stories that a committee of Social Credit legislators deemed inaccurate, and to reveal their sources on demand.\n\nThe act was a result of the stormy relationship between Aberhart and the press, which dated to before the 1935 election, in which the Social Credit League was elected to government. Virtually all of Alberta's newspapers—especially the \"Calgary Herald\"—were critical of Social Credit, as were a number of publications from elsewhere in Canada. Even the American media had greeted Aberhart's election with derision.\n\nThough the act won easy passage through the Social Credit-dominated legislature, Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta John C. Bowen reserved royal assent until the Supreme Court of Canada evaluated the act's legality. In 1938's \"Reference re Alberta Statutes\", the court found that it was unconstitutional, and it never became law.\n\nWilliam Aberhart's Social Credit League, running candidates for the first time, won a large majority in the 1935 Alberta election on the strength of promises to use a new economic theory called social credit to end depression conditions in the province. It did so against the almost uniform opposition of the news media. Some of the province's major newspapers were loyal to one of the traditional parties: the \"Edmonton Bulletin\", for example, had supported the Liberals since its inception.\n\nAberhart initially laid out his economic agenda in only vague terms, and by early 1935 his opponents, including Premier Richard Gavin Reid of the United Farmers of Alberta, were trying to force him to commit to a specific plan. The \"Calgary Herald\" took up this call, going so far as to offer Aberhart a full page to lay out his approach in detail. Aberhart refused, on the grounds that he considered the \"Herald\"'s coverage of him to be unfair. He frequently attacked the newspaper in speeches around the province, and on April 28 suggested that his followers boycott it and other unfriendly newspapers. The boycott was successful to the extent that it drove at least one newspaper out of business. The \"Herald\" responded to the boycott by asking \"Is everyone opposed to the political opinions and plans of Mr. Aberhart to be boycotted? He has invoked a most dangerous precedent and has given the people of this province a foretaste of the Hitlerism which will prevail if he ever secures control of the provincial administration.\"\n\nShortly before the election, the \"Herald\" began to run cartoons by Stewart Cameron, a virulently anti-Aberhart cartoonist. The day before the election, it ran one featuring a car, labelled \"the people\", travelling along \"Aberhart Highway No. 1\" and arriving at a railway crossing. A train, labelled \"common sense\", was approaching from around the bend, along tracks labelled \"fundamental facts\". Aberhart leans out the \"S.C. Signal Tower\" advising the car \"All's clear. Don't stop, look or listen.\"\n\nThough the \"Herald\" was the most strident in its opposition to Aberhart and Social Credit, the \"Bulletin\", the \"Edmonton Journal\", the \"Medicine Hat News\", the \"Lethbridge Herald\", and many smaller papers all, in the words of Athabasca University historian Alvin Finkel, \"attacked Social Credit viciously as a chimera which, if placed in power, would wreck Alberta's chances for economic recovery.\" Of the province's major papers, only the \"Calgary Albertan\" provided even lukewarm support.\n\nSo frustrated were the Social Crediters with the newspapers' hostility that in 1934 they founded their own, the \"Alberta Social Credit Chronicle\", to spread their views. The \"Chronicle\", in addition to acting as Aberhart's mouthpiece, carried guest editorials by such figures as British fascist leader Oswald Mosley and anti-semitic priest Charles Coughlin.\n\nMedia reaction to Social Credit's 1935 victory, in which it won 56 of 63 seats in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, was almost uniformly negative. The \"Herald\" opined that \"the people of Alberta have made a most unfortunate decision and may soon see the folly of it.\" Even the \"Albertan\" expressed its wish that social credit be first tried in \"Scotland, or Ethiopia or anywhere but Alberta.\" Reaction across Canada was also negative; the \"St. Catharines Standard\" called the results \"a nightmare that passeth all understanding\" and the \"Montreal Star\" accused Albertans of voting for \"an untried man and a policy whose workings he ostentatiously refused to explain before polling day.\" American newspapers were less restrained: the \"Chicago Tribune\" asked \"Greetings to the Canadians. Who's loony now?\" and the \"Boston Herald\"'s headline screamed \"Alberta goes crazy\".\n\nThe relationship did not improve once Aberhart took office. In January 1935, H. Napier Moore wrote two articles for \"Maclean's\" casting doubt on Aberhart's honesty and his ability to follow through on his election promises. The American \"Collier's Weekly\" ran a profile that mocked Aberhart's appearance, taking note of his \"vast colorless face\" and his \"narrow, left slanted mouth with soft, extra-heavy, bloodless lips which don't quite meet and through which he breathes wetly.\" Finkel, finding fault with both sides of the Aberhart-press feud, states\nThe major newspapers of the province opposed virtually everything the government did. Virtually every reform instituted was made to sound more draconian than it actually was. The conservative views of the owners and editors often interfered with the objective presentation of news reports, although perhaps not to the extent that the government claimed. In many cases, the papers simply concentrated on the very real chaos and confusion in government ranks and required few embellishments to make the government look bad.\nThe \"Herald\" lured Stewart Cameron away from working on Disney's \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" to make him its first ever staff cartoonist; Cameron devoted himself full-time to the ridicule of Aberhart. Though Social Credit staffer turned journalistic historian John Barr argues that the media's unswerving hostility to Aberhart may have benefited him politically by allowing him to \"depict the press as a mere tool of Eastern financial and commercial interests\", by January 1936 Aberhart was telling the listeners of his weekly gospel radio show that he was \"glad there will be no newspapers in heaven.\"\n\nTo help combat the negative press, Aberhart resolved to gain control of the \"Albertan\", the one paper of note to show him any support. He formed a company that acquired an option to purchase it, and used his radio program to promote the purchase of shares by Social Credit supporters. The other newspapers criticized him for using what was nominally a gospel program to promote stock sales. The plan came to naught, as most Social Credit supporters were too poor to buy newspaper stock, and the only interested buyers were beneficiaries of government patronage, chiefly liquor interests. Even so, the \"Albertan\" became the official organ of Social Credit, an editorial decision that doubled its circulation.\n\nAberhart reacted bitterly to the media's hostility. In a September 20, 1937, radio broadcast, he said of the press \"these creatures with mental hydrophobia will be taken in hand and their biting and barking will cease.\" Four days later, a special session of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta opened, with the \"Accurate News and Information Act\" figuring prominently on its order paper.\n\nThe 1937 Social Credit backbenchers' revolt had forced Aberhart to abdicate a portion of his power to the newly created Social Credit Board, which consisted of five Social Credit backbenchers charged with supervising a commission of experts. While the initial plan was to have this commission headed by C. H. Douglas, social credit's British founder, Douglas did not like Aberhart and did not view his approach to social credit as consistent with its true form. He refused to come. Instead, he sent two subordinates, L. D. Byrne and G. F. Powell. These surrogates were charged with recommending legislation to implement social credit in Alberta. Their first round of proposals, which included measures imposing government control on banks and prohibiting any person from challenging the constitutionality of any Alberta law in court without receiving the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, was disallowed by the federal government. The second round included the \"Accurate News and Information Act\".\n\nThe act empowered the chair of the Social Credit Board to require a newspaper to reveal the names and addresses of its sources, as well as the names and addresses of any writers, including of unsigned pieces. Non-compliance would result in fines of up to $1,000 per day, and prohibitions on the publishing of the offending newspaper, of stories by offending writers, or of information emanating from offending sources. The act also required newspapers to print, at the instruction of the chair of the Social Credit Board, any statement \"which has for its object the correction or amplification of any statement relating to any policy or activity of the Government of the Province.\"\n\nThe act was attacked by opposition politicians as evidence of the government's supposed fascism, and alienated even the \"Albertan\". The international press was also cutting: one British paper referred to Aberhart as \"a little Hitler\". Later commentators have been no more favourable: Finkel calls the act evidence of the \"increasingly authoritarian nature of the Aberhart regime\", and even Barr, generally sympathetic to Social Credit, calls it \"a harsh blow to free speech\".\n\nLieutenant-Governor John C. Bowen, mindful of the federal government's disallowance of the Social Credit Board's earlier legislation, reserved royal assent of the act and its companions until their legality could be tested at the Supreme Court of Canada. This was the first use of the power of reservation in Alberta history, and in the summer of 1938 Aberhart's government announced the elimination of Bowen's official residence, his government car, and his secretarial staff. Aberhart biographers David Elliott and Iris Miller and Ernest Manning biographer Brian Brennan attribute this move to revenge for Bowen's reservation of assent.\n\nBowen put a stop to the \"Accurate News and Information Act\", at least temporarily, but Aberhart's fight against the press continued: on March 25, 1938, a resolution of the Social Credit-dominated legislature ordered that Don Brown, a reporter for the \"Edmonton Journal\", be jailed \"during the pleasure of the assembly\" for allegedly misquoting Social Credit backbencher John Lyle Robinson on the inclusion of chiropractors in the \"Workman's Compensation Act\". Brown was never actually jailed; the next day, in response to negative publicity from across Canada, the legislature passed another resolution, ordering \"the release of Mr. Don C. Brown from custody.\" In Barr's view, \"the government was made to look less ominous than silly.\"\n\nAround the same time, the Supreme Court ruled on the \"Reference re Alberta Statutes\". It found that the \"Accurate News and Information Act\", along with the others submitted to it for evaluation, was \"ultra vires\" (beyond the powers of) the Alberta government. In the case of the \"Accurate News and Information Act\", the court found that the Canadian constitution included an \"implied bill of rights\" that protected freedom of speech as being critical to a parliamentary democracy.\n\nFor its leadership in the fight against the act, the Pulitzer Prize committee awarded the \"Edmonton Journal\" a bronze plaque, the first time it honoured a non-American newspaper. Ninety-five other newspapers, including the \"Calgary Albertan\", \"Edmonton Bulletin\", \"Calgary Herald\", \"Lethbridge Herald\", and \"Medicine Hat News\", were presented with engraved certificates.\n\n\n"}

One significant aspect of The Act is that it replaced anti-social behaviour orders, the primary civil order in the United Kingdom since 1998, with criminal behaviour orders. Home Secretary Theresa May and John Taylor, Baron Taylor of Holbeach introduced the legislation.\n\nIn 2012, the government produced a white paper titled ‘Putting victims first: more effective responses to anti-social behaviour’, that outlined its intentions about reforming anti-social behaviour legislation. The white paper stated that it wanted to challenge ‘\"dangerous and yobbish behaviour of those who make victims’ lives a misery\"’. The 2013 government paper, ‘Reform of Anti-Social Behaviour Powers: Groups ‘Hanging Around’’ mentioned specifically targeting certain types of youths behaviour. It mentioned that the Government acknowledged that youths ‘hanging about’ might cause people to feel intimidated and fear for their safety regardless if their behaviour was anti-social. Government publications also revealed it was eager to deal with concerns about the perceived anti-social behaviour of people who are drunks, beggars, and irresponsible dog owners.\n\nThe focus for the Act was on putting victims first, and the powers are designed to be quicker to implement so that victims get respite from anti-social behaviour faster. With the exception of the Criminal Behaviour Order, the remainder can be processed through the civil courts which allows for a lower burden of proof and thus makes it easier for agencies to obtain. The Act also set out an absolute possession enabling Councils and Housing Association to evict anti-social tenants already found guilty of anti-social behaviour.\n\nTo put victims first, there were also two measures introduced in this Act to enable victims to have their say:\n\n\nThe focus of the Act was to streamline the tools and powers available to front-line agencies in dealing with anti-social behaviour. Previously there had been nineteen different powers, but these were reduced to a base of six.\n\nThe previous sixteen mechanisms were,\n\nAnti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 consolidated them to,\n\nThe government produces statutory guidance about the use of the six new mechanisms. December 2017 is the latest revision of the guidance .\n\nPart 1 of the Act empowers specified organisation to apply to the courts for a civil injunction aged 10 or over for actual or threatened anti-social behaviour. Suggested by the government is that civil injunctions might be used for aggressive begging, bullying, gangs, irresponsible dog ownership, noisy or abusive neighbours, public drunkenness, and vandalism. The injunction is a civil rather than a criminal order. A civil injunction can either prohibit or require a person from activities mentioned in the order. A court has the discretion if to include a power of arrest for breaches of the injunction. Breaches of an injunction are treated as contempt of court. Statutory government guidance provides four tests for using a civil injunction. On the balance of probabilities, the behaviour must be likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress (non-housing related anti-social behaviour); or conduct capable of causing nuisance or annoyance (housing-related anti-social behaviour); and just and convenient to grant the injunction to prevent anti-social behaviour.\n\nPart 3 of the Act covers police powers permitting the dispersal of people. The powers of dispersal require the authorisation of a police officer at least the rank of Inspector. The Act only allows authorising dispersal powers when members of the Public in the locality are being harassed, alarmed or distressed, or when there is localised crime and disorder. The authorisation is limited to forty-eight hours. Authorising officers should consider the principles of the Human Rights Act. The statutory Government guidance requires consideration of the impact of vulnerable people, the displacement of the problems elsewhere, and if working in partnership with other agencies might provide a longer-term solution.\n\nWhen authorised to do so, police officers and police community support officers, if permitted by their Chief Constable, can, in writing when feasible, direct a person to leave a geographical area and not return for a defined time period. The exceptions are people under ten years old, in which case if they are under sixteen, the Children Act 2004, allows taking them to their home. A direction should not be given that prevents a person from going to their home, their place of employment, where they are receiving education or training, places where they are receiving medical treatment or any place they are required to attend by a court. The power exists to seize any articles that connected to the anti-social behaviour. Failing to disperse or preventing the seizure of articles related to the anti-social behaviour is a criminal offence.\n\nPart 4 of the Act introduced Community Protection Notices and Remedial Orders. The aim of them was to challenge ongoing nuisance problems detrimental to a community’s quality of life. The use of Community Protection Notices does not interfere with the obligation of local authorities to issue abatement notices for statutory nuisances.\n\nA person over the age of sixteen, an organisation or business can be issued a Community Protection Notice. The statutory guidance states that the vulnerability of a person should additionally be considered before issuing a notice. Before a notice is issued they must receive written notice warning them about the problem they are causing, and issuing a notice is an option being considered. It is issued by either giving it to a person, organisation or business, leaving at their address, or posting it to them. Community Protection Notices have three potential purposes, to stop or make them do something, or take reasonable steps towards an outcome. What is expected of them is written on the notice.\n\nFailing to conform to a Community Protection Notice is an offence. The liability of a person, organisation or business for the offence is negated by payment of a fixed penalty notice up to the value of £100. If a Community Protection Notice is breached, a Remedial Order can be applied for at court.\n\nPart 4 of the Act empowers the issuing of Closure Notices and Closure Orders. Both notices and orders can be applied to residential and other premises. Issuing a Closure Notice is usually the first resort to dealing with a problem. Closure Notices can be issued if either nuisance or disorder has, or may occur at the premises. The Notice is in force for a maximum of forty-eight hours. A Closure Notice can bar any person from accessing the premises, except any residents. The penalty for breaching a Notice upon conviction is a maximum of three months’ imprisonment and an unlimited fine.\n\nClosure Orders are usually issued in more serious instances. The criteria for issuing an order is that the premises must be connected to disorderly, offensive, or criminal behaviour, or disorderly behaviour in the near vicinity of it. It must be a serious nuisance to the public. An order can prohibit any person from entering the premises, including a resident. The maximum penalty for breaching a notice is up to six months imprisonment and an unlimited fine.\n\nThe Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 created an offence of obstructing a person issuing an order or notice, officials entering the premises, or people securing it. The maximum penalty is three months imprisonment. The Act did no consolidate all closure powers, for example, closure of licensed premises under the Licensing Act 2003, or certain premises used for prostitution, under the Sexual Offences Act 2003.\n\nThe Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 included several provisions not related to anti-social behaviour,\n\n\nThe Act also created Sexual Risk Orders, which can require suspects to give police advanced notification of intention to engage in sexual activities or face prison sentences. The SROs, requested by police, are issued by magistrates.\n\nThe Act also created several new offences relating to forced marriage:\nThe latter two offences are defined separately for England and Wales and for Scotland. They apply to any marriage ceremony even if not legally binding.\n\nA general criticism of the Act was it interfered with the rights of young people, made them feel unable to use public places as they wish, even if their behaviour and activities are lawful.\n\n\n"}

It was adopted on 26 June 2012 by the Diplomatic Conference on the Protection of Audiovisual Performances of the World Intellectual Property Organization, in which 156 WIPO member states, six intergovernmental, and six non-governmental organizations participated. Forty-eight countries signed the treaty on 26 June, followed by 19 other countries in 2012 and 2013. 20 states have ratified or acceded to the treaty. The treaty will not enter into force until it has been ratified or acceded to by at least 30 parties.\n\nThe treaty has been praised by artists' and performers rights advocates around the world as well as some activist nonprofits such as Knowledge Ecology International, but has also been criticized by some digital rights and free culture activists such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) as an infringement on free speech, and aiding censorship schemes.\n\nNegotiations for the treaty lasted 12 years. It was adopted on 26 June 2012 by WIPO's Diplomatic Conference on the Protection of Audiovisual Performances, which began on 20 June in Beijing. 156 WIPO member states, six intergovernmental and six non-governmental organizations participated in the conference.\n\nThe Final Act of the treaty was signed by 122 countries, and the treaty itself collected 48 country signatures. Signatories from Europe include Cyprus, Denmark, France, Hungary, Italy, Moldova, Spain, Switzerland; from Americas, Chile, Colombia, Grenada, Costa Rica, Haiti, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua, Peru and the United States of America; and from Asia, China, Mongolia, South Korea. The convention remained open for signature for one year. During that time, 19 additional countries and the European Union joined as signatories (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Botswana, Czech Republic, El Salvador, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Honduras, Indonesia, Montenegro, Poland, Qatar, Romania, Slovenia, the United Kingdom, and Zimbabwe). Further countries may become a party to the treaty through accession. The treaty has not entered into force until it has been ratified by at least 30 eligible parties.\n\nIn February 2016, U.S. President Barack Obama submitted the treaty to the U.S. Senate for ratification.\n\nThe treaty is a multilateral treaty which regulates copyright for audiovisual performances.\n\nAccording to WIPO \"the new treaty brings audiovisual performers into the fold of the international copyright framework in a comprehensive way, for the first time\", referring to the clauses dedicated to protecting their works on the Internet. It addresses the issue of the copyright system discriminating against certain groups of performers, as the previous treaties, such as WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty, focused more on the sound than visual aspects. WIPO states that the treaty boosts the economic rights and moral rights of audiovisual performers (the performers' rights). The expanded economic rights give them an opportunity to share the income collected by producers from internationally distributed audiovisual works. The moral rights address issues such as lack of attribution and distortion.\n\nThe treaty has been praised by a number of audiovisual performers. Publicity was provided by the presence and support from several world-famous actors, namely American Meryl Streep, Brazilian Sônia Braga, Chinese Mei Baojiu and Spanish Javier Bardem and Antonio Banderas, who spoke out on several instances endorsing the treaty. Government representatives from China, EU, and the United States also supported the initiative. Organizations supporting the treaty include the International Intellectual Property Alliance.\n\nThe treaty has been criticized by digital rights and free culture scholars and activists, for giving the actors a monopoly on deciding how their audiovisual performances can be used. The performers in question no longer have to hold the copyright to their work for that purpose critics claim, it is possible that the new treaty would make it increasingly illegal to use clips from movies, TV series, and other such preferences in mash-ups, remixes, and parodies. There are fears that this would allow actors and musicians (who are also covered by the treaty) to shut down any such parody or commentary not to their liking, thus infringing on free speech and limiting fair use and similar reuse rights. Professor Hannibal Travis noted that the treaty makes it easier to set up censorship schemes. Techdirt has remarked that the treaty also allows for those new rights to be transferred to the producers, which can lead to a system where the performers are forced to do so, thus further strengthening the producers and organizations like RIAA and MPAA.\n\n"}

It proposed amendments to Chapter 113 of Title 18 of the United States Code that would authorize the Attorney General to bring an \"in rem\" action against any domain name found \"dedicated to infringing activities\", as defined within the text of the bill. Upon bringing such an action, and obtaining an order for relief, the registrar of, or registry affiliated with, the infringing domain would be compelled to \"suspend operation of and lock the domain name.\"\n\nThe bill was supported by the Motion Picture Association of America, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Screen Actors Guild, Viacom, and the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, Moving Picture Technicians, Artists and Allied Crafts of the United States.\n\nIt was opposed by organizations and individuals such as Center for Democracy and Technology, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Demand Progress, the Distributed Computing Industry Association, Tim Berners-Lee, the American Civil Liberties Union and Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe bill passed the Senate Judiciary Committee with a vote of 19-0 but never received a full vote on the Senate floor. Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) announced he would take the steps necessary to halt COICA so it is not enacted into law in 2010, and was successful, effectively killing this bill and requiring it to be resubmitted and for it to make it through a new committee again in 2011 with a different makeup of its members. The Act was rewritten as the Protect IP Act.\n\nThe text of the bill defined an infringing website as one that is:\n\n(A) primarily designed, has no demonstrable, commercially significant purpose or use other than, or is marketed by its operator, or by a person acting in concert with the operator, to offer:\n\n(i) goods or services in violation of title 17, United States Code, or enable or facilitate a violation of title 17, United States Code, including by offering or providing access to, without the authorization of the copyright owner or otherwise by operation of law, copies of, or public performance or display of, works protected by title 17, in complete or substantially complete form, by any means, including by means of download, transmission, or otherwise, including the provision of a link or aggregated links to other sites or Internet resources for obtaining such copies for accessing such performance or displays; or\n\n(ii) to sell or distribute goods, services, or materials bearing a counterfeit mark, as that term is defined in section 34(d) of the Act entitled 'An Act to provide for the registration and protection of trademarks used in commerce, to carry out the provisions of certain international conventions, and for other purposes', approved July 5, 1946 (commonly referred to as the 'Trademark Act of 1946' or the 'Lanham Act'; (d)); and\n(B) engaged in the activities described in subparagraph (A), and when taken together, such activities are central to the activity of the Internet site or sites accessed through a specific domain name.\n\nThe bill, if passed, would have allowed the Attorney General to bring an \"in rem\" action against the infringing domain name in United States District Court, and seek an order requesting injunctive relief. If granted, such an order would compel the register of the domain name in question to take the following actions:\nUpon receipt of such order, the domain name registrar or domain name registry shall suspend operation of, and may lock, the domain name.\nIf the infringing website had not been located in the United States, the bill empowered the Attorney General to bring a similar action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Should an order for injunctive relief been granted, the Attorney General would then have been empowered to serve said order upon, and compel to perform the actions listed:\n(i) a service provider, as that term is defined in section 512(k)(1) of title 17, United States Code, or other operator of a domain name system server shall take reasonable steps that will prevent a domain name from resolving to that domain name's Internet protocol address;\n\n(ii) a financial transaction provider, as that term is defined in section 5362(4) of title 31, United States Code, shall take reasonable measures, as expeditiously as practical, to prevent--\n(I) its service from processing transactions for customers located within the United States based on purchases associated with the domain name; and\n\n(II) its trademarks from being authorized for use on Internet sites associated with such domain name; and\n(iii) a service that serves contextual or display advertisements to Internet sites shall take reasonable measures, as expeditiously as practical, to prevent its network from serving advertisements to an Internet site accessed through such domain name.\nShould a party fail to comply with an order served upon it by the Attorney General, the Attorney General would have been able to bring an \"in personam\" action against the party in question.\n\nThe bill also called for the creation, by the Justice Department, of two publicly available lists of domain names. The first list would have been composed of domain names against which the Attorney General has obtained injunctions. Domestic domains would be required to be locked by their registrars, and service providers, financial institutions, and advertisers would be required to block service to any nondomestic domains on this list. The second list would be a list of domains \"alleged\" by the Justice Department to be infringing, but against which no action had been taken. Any service provider who willingly took steps to block access to sites on this second list would gain immunity from prosecution under this bill.\n\nDue to various concerns from outside parties, Senator Patrick Leahy proposed an amendment to the legislation that responded to these concerns, while preserving the purpose of the legislation. The amendment:\n\n\nPublic reaction to the bill was negative by consumer groups, while the bill was generally lauded by artist's rights groups, various labor unions, and the entertainment and publishing industries. The announcement of the bill was rapidly followed by a wave of protest from digital rights activists, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation.Demand Progress's petition against COICA garnered more than 300,000 signatures.\n\nOn September 30, 2010, the EFF posted an update to their Deeplinks Blog, announcing that the hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee had been delayed until after the 2010 midterm elections. On November 18, 2010, the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously approved the bipartisan bill. On November 26, 2010, the New York Times reported that the U.S. government had seized the domain names of 82 websites, which digital rights advocates used as an example of overreaching enforcement that can already occur under current law, which they believe will take place more frequently and on a broader basis under the more lenient enforcement requirements set by COICA.\n\nOregon Democratic Senator Ron Wyden opposed the bill after it passed the Senate Judiciary Committee on November 18, 2010, saying that unless it is changed, he will prevent it from coming to a vote on the full Senate floor this year. He said:\n\nIt seems to me that online copyright infringement is a legitimate problem, but it seems to me that COICA as written is the wrong medicine. Deploying this statute to combat online copyright infringement seems almost like using a bunker-busting cluster bomb when what you really need is a precision-guided missile. The collateral damage of this statute could be American innovation, American jobs, and a secure Internet.\n\n\n"}

A company may wish still to seal documents as a means of protection against forgery.\n\nTraditionally, the seal was of some legal significance because the affixing of the seal signified that the document was the act and deed of the company, whereas when a document was merely signed by a director, then that was deemed to be an act carried out on behalf of the company by its agents, which was subject to applicable restrictions and limitations under the ordinary law of agency.\n\nCorporate seals are generally only used for two purposes by corporations today:\n\nPhysically, seals used to be used to make an impression on melted wax on the relevant document, although modern seals will usually only leave an indentation or impression on the paper (although sometimes a red wafer is used to imitate old red wax seals, and to make the sealing show up better on photocopies).\n"}

The Convention was originally intended as a Protocol to the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, while the 1954 Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons was adopted to cover stateless persons who are not refugees and therefore not within the scope of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.\n\nWhile one case of statelessness was identified in the \"Protocol relating to a Certain Case of Statelessness\" at the League of Nations Codification Conference, 1930 in The Hague: \"In a State whose nationality is not conferred by the mere fact of birth in its territory, a person born in its territory of a mother possessing the nationality of that State and of a father without nationality or of unknown nationality shall have the nationality of the said State.\" Over time, many signatories have adjusted their laws to ensure this rule remains true. (For example, in Australian nationality law, a child born in the country acquires citizenship if any parent is a citizen). However, despite this, many cases remained ambiguous or uncovered primarily due to the fact that a person did not always receive the nationality of its parents, or was born in a certain place and not always provided citizenship of that state.\n\nThe Nansen International Office For Refugees, an organization of the League of Nations, was internationally in charge of refugees from war areas from 1930 to 1939. It received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1938. Their Nansen passports, designed in 1922 by founder Fridtjof Nansen, were internationally recognized identity cards first issued by the League of Nations to stateless refugees. In 1942 they were honored by governments in 52 countries and were the first refugee travel documents.\n\nMigrations forced from political instability during World War II and its immediate aftermath highlighted the international dimensions of problems presented by unprecedented volumes of displaced persons including those rendered effectively stateless.\n\nDating from December 1948, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights at Article 15 affirms that:\n\n\nAt the Fourth United Nations General Assembly Session in October–December 1949, the International Law Commission included the topic \"Nationality, \"including statelessness\"\" in its list of topics of international law provisionally selected for codification. At the behest of the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) in its 11th Session soon after, that item was given priority.\n\nThe Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees was done on 28 July 1951. It was originally desired to cover 'refugees \"and\" stateless persons'; however, agreement was not reached with respect to the latter.\n\nThe International Law Commission at its fifth session in 1953 produced both a Draft Convention on the \"Elimination\" of Future Statelessness, and a Draft Convention on the \"Reduction\" of Future Statelessness. ECOSOC approved both drafts.\n\nThe 1954 Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons was done in September 1954 (\"The Status Convention\"). This completed the unfinished work of the Refugee Convention three years prior.\n\nOn 4 December 1954 the UN General Assembly by Resolution adopted both drafts as the basis of its desire for a conference of plenipotentiaries and an eventual Convention.\n\nIn respect of contracting states:\nThere are 21 Articles, summarised below:\n\n\nAs of September 2018, there are 73 states which have ratified or acceded to the convention.

The uncertainty of ownership decreases the value of the asset and/or the ability to lend or borrow against it. These lost forms of value are dead capital.\n\nThe term \"dead capital\" was coined by Peruvian Economist Hernando de Soto Polar.\n\nDe Soto estimates there is US$ 9.3 trillion in dead capital globally. The US$ 9.3 trillion are assets owned by poor or middle-class people in emerging economies which cannot be realized due to poor policies, procedures or bureaucracy.\n\nIf these assets in the informal sector were recognized and brought into the mainstream, market economy, they could become the key to fostering development.\n\nLocal political instability, corruption, rational under investment.\n\nThe economic impacts of dead capital are immense, only well-connected people have the ability to use their capital, join it together with other assets and create surplus value for further investment. Only these people can get life, educational, medical or property and casualty insurance and thus shield themselves from any problems. Only they can obtain unsecured loans (or even secured loans) after presenting proper evidence of their property claims. The legal morass that complicates the property system disables them from being connected to the world. This then leaves a massive shadow economy which although very wealthy, does not fully contribute to the economy and does not help its participants fully achieve their potential.\n\n"}
{"id": "33828434", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33828434", "title": "Digitalcourage", "text": "Digitalcourage\n\nDigitalcourage – known until November 2012 as FoeBuD (\"Verein zur Förderung des öffentlichen bewegten und unbewegten Datenverkehrs\") – is a German privacy and digital rights organisation. Under the motif of preserving \"a world worth living in the digital age\", Digitalcourage campaigns for civil and human rights, consumer protection, privacy, freedom of information and related issues. The group has links with organisations such as the German Working Group against Data Retention (\"Arbeitskreis Vorratsdatenspeicherung\") and the Chaos Computer Club, and it is a member of the umbrella organisation European Digital Rights.\n\nThe group is known for organising the German Big Brother Awards. These negative awards recognise “companies, institutions and persons who act in a prominent and sustained way to invade people's privacy or leak (personal) data to third parties”. An annual award ceremony featuring “winners” in various categories is organised by Digitalcourage.\n\nTo highlight the privacy implications of bonus or customer “loyalty” cards, the organisation issued the so-called “Privacy Card”. Its design mirrored the popular “Payback” card and it bore the number of a regular card registered in FoeBuD's name. Users collected bonus points on behalf of FoeBuD, sharing one and the same customer profile. After 2,000 of these cards were being used, Payback disabled FoeBuD's registration and card contract.\nSince October 2003, Digitalcourage has been active on the issue of RFID and founded a campaign called “StopRFID” to accompany the introduction of this technology from a critical perspective.\n\nFoeBuD has organised or supported various complaints at the German Constitutional Court against disputed laws, such as those on data rentention, a central database for employees’ wages, or Internet blocking.\n\nFoeBuD was a co-founder of the German Working Group against Data Retention and supports an annual demonstration focusing on security measures that restrict civil liberties, under the name “Freedom Not Fear”.\n\nIn response to the threat to anonymity posed by date retention, Digitalcourage is running a Tor exit node on a rented server. The organisation also makes and sells the \"PrivacyDongle\", a USB pen drive that can be used to run \"Tor Browser\" as a portable app, i.e. without installing it under Windows or MacOS.\nAs part of the campaign against the now abandoned law to introduce Internet blocking (Zugangserschwerungsgesetz), which would have been implemented by DNS poisoning, Digitalcourage is operating a public “anti-censorship” DNS server under the IP address 85.214.20.141. Due to high demand a second server of this kind has been operated since 26th April 2018 under the IP address 46.182.19.48.\n\nIn 1987, a mailbox (bulletin board) system named BIONIC was created and operated by FoeBuD members. Objectives were to run a mailbox without censorship and to deny unlimited rights to the system’s administrators, regulating conflicts through the community instead. BIONIC became the birthplace of several early mailbox networks. The mailbox and linked networks were an early “home on the net” for many groupings in the left or “alternative” political spectrum.\n\nEric Bachman, a BIONIC user and FoeBuD member, instigated the \"ZaMir Transnational Network\" in 1991 in response to the Yugoslav wars, which were beginning at the time. \"Za mir\" means “for peace”, and the network served as a low-cost and simple link between peace groups in that region, as a form of nonviolent resistance. The BIONIC software proved useful under the limited resources available; e.g. in Sarajevo, 1,500 users were served using just 3 telephone lines. Other mailboxes existed in Ljubljana (Slovenia), Zagreb (Croatia), Belgrade (Serbia), Tuzla (Bosnia) and Priština (Kosovo).\n\nFoeBuD co-founders Rena Tangens and padeluun had been active in the punk rock and media art scenes and established a gallery named \"Art d’Ameublement\" in Bielefeld in 1984. The gallery hosted the Chaos Computer Club as an exhibit in 1985, and a group of local enthusiasts for then-current forms of computer communication, hacking and social or philosophical matters formed around the gallery. This led to a monthly event called \"Public Domain\" that was both a meeting for practical research and a talk and discussion series.\n\nEventually, an association with charity status was formed. The organisation’s full name, “association for the promotion of public mobile and immobile data exchange” (\"Verein zur Förderung des öffentlichen bewegten und unbewegten Datenverkehrs\"), and the acronym FoeBuD were conceived as a parody of the language used by the telecommunications operator, Deutsche Bundespost, which was then the state authority and monopolist for telephone and postal communications. Telecommunications equipment was heavily regulated on the German network, and the devices that were available often had names and acronyms that appeared bureaucratic and cumbersome. As FoeBuD’s activities and reputation spread outside the hacker scene and the historic background has largely been lost, the name was often perceived as just obscure.\n\nAs the organisation was nearing its 25th anniversary, it was perceived that the name FoeBuD had turned from an in-joke into an obstacle for the group’s publicity. A new name was sought, and eventually “Digitalcourage” was chosen and announced on 17 Nov 2012.\n\nThe ZaMir network was chosen for an award named “sense/information“ (\"Sinnformation\") by the Green parliamentary party in the German parliament (\"Bundestag\") in 1998. FoeBuD received a nationally reputed award, the \"Theodor Heuss medal\", for its civil rights activities in 2008.\n"}

In 1985, he received a Master of Philosophy in history and a JD from Yale University. He has held visiting appointments at Harvard University, Tel Aviv University and the University of Virginia since 1987.\n\nHe was a law clerk to Justice Thurgood Marshall (1986–87 term). He joined the faculty of Columbia Law School in 1987, and was admitted to the New York bar in 1988. He received a Ph.D. in history from Yale University in 1993. Moglen serves as a director of the Public Patent Foundation.\n\nMoglen was part of Philip Zimmermann's defense team, when Zimmermann was being investigated over the export of Pretty Good Privacy, a public key encryption system, under US export laws.\n\nIn 2003 he received the EFF Pioneer Award. In February 2005, he founded the Software Freedom Law Center.\n\nMoglen was closely involved with the Free Software Foundation, serving as general counsel from 1994-2016 and board member from 2000 to 2007. As counsel, Moglen was charged with enforcing the GNU General Public License (GPL) on behalf of the FSF, and later became heavily involved with drafting version 3 of the GPL. On April 23, 2007 he announced in a blog post that he would be stepping down from the board of directors of the Free Software Foundation. Moglen stated that after the GPLv3 Discussion Draft 3 had been released, he wanted to devote more time to writing, teaching, and the Software Freedom Law Center.\n\nIn February 2011, Moglen created the Freedom Box Foundation to design software for a very small server called the FreedomBox. The FreedomBox aims to be an affordable personal server which runs only free software, with a focus on anonymous and secure communication. FreedomBox launched version 0.1 in 2012.\n\nMoglen says that free software is a fundamental requirement for a democratic and free society in which we are surrounded by and dependent upon technical devices. Only if controlling these devices is open to all via free software, can we balance power equally.\n\n\"Moglen's Metaphorical Corollary to Faraday's Law\" is the idea that the information appearance and flow between the human minds connected via the Internet works like electromagnetic induction. Hence Moglen's phrase \"Resist the resistance!\" (i.e. remove anything that inhibits the flow of information).\n\nMoglen believes the idea of proprietary software is as ludicrous as having \"proprietary mathematics\" or \"proprietary geometry.\" This would convert the subjects from \"something you can learn\" into \"something you must buy\", he has argued. He points out that software is among the \"things which can be copied infinitely over and over again, without any further costs.\"\n\nMoglen has criticized what he calls the \"reification of selfishness.\" He has said, \"A world full of computers which you can't understand, can't fix and can't use (because it is controlled by inaccessible proprietary software) is a world controlled by machines.\"\n\nHe has called on lawyers to help the Free Software movement, saying: \"Those who want to share their code can make products and share their work without additional legal risks.\" He urged his legal colleagues, \"It's worth giving up a little in order to produce a sounder ecology for all. Think kindly about the idea of sharing.\"\n\nMoglen has criticized trends which result in \"excluding people from knowledge.\" On the issue of Free Software versus proprietary software, he has argued that \"much has been said by the few who stand to lose.\" Moglen calls for a \"sensible respect for both the creators and users\" of software code. In general, this concept is a part of what Moglen has termed a \"revolution\" against the privileged owners of media, distribution channels, and software. On March 13, 2009, in a speech given at Seattle University, Moglen said of the free software movement that, \"'When everybody owns the press, then freedom of the press belongs to everybody' seems to be the inevitable inference, and that’s where we are moving, and when the publishers get used to that, they’ll become us, and we’ll become them, and the first amendment will mean: 'Congress shall make no law [...] abridging freedom of speech, or of the press [...].', \"not\" – as they have tended to argue in the course of the 20th century – 'Congress shall make no law infringing the sacred right of the Sulzbergers to be different.'\"\n\nOn the subject of Digital Rights Management, Moglen once said, \"We also live in a world in which the right to tinker is under some very substantial threat. This is said to be because movie and record companies must eat. I will concede that they must eat. Though, like me, they should eat less.\"\n\n"}

The area includes the doctrine of restraint of trade and, particularly in the United Kingdom, has largely been submerged in the twentieth century by statutory interventions on collective labour law and modern competition law, and certain laws governing intellectual property, particularly unfair competition law. The \"absence of any unifying principle drawing together the different heads of economic tort liability has often been remarked upon.\"\n\nThe principal torts are:\n\nThese torts represent the common law's historical attempt to balance the need to protect claimants against those who inflict economic harm and the wider need to allow effective, even aggressive, competition (including competition between employers and their workers).\n\nTwo cases demonstrate economic torts' affinity to competition and labour law. In \"Mogul Steamship Co Ltd\" the plaintiffs argued they had been driven from the Chinese tea market by a 'shipping conference', that had acted together to underprice them. But this cartel was ruled lawful and \"nothing more [than] a war of competition waged in the interest of their own trade.\" Nowadays, this would be considered a criminal cartel.\n\nIn English labour law the most notable case is \"Taff Vale Railway v. Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants\". The House of Lords thought that unions should be liable in tort for helping workers to go on strike for better pay and conditions. But it riled workers so much that it led to the creation of the British Labour Party and the Trade Disputes Act 1906. Further torts used against unions include conspiracy, interference with a commercial contract or intimidation.\n\nSeveral of the economic torts in English law, in particular inducing breach of contract and \"tortious interference\" (otherwise known as causing loss by unlawful means), have been reviewed and clarified by the House of Lords:\n\nIn 2014, the Supreme Court of Canada, favouring the ruling in \"OBG\", standardized Canadian jurisprudence with respect to the \"tort of unlawful interference with economic relations\" (which it preferred to call \"causing loss by unlawful means\", or the \"unlawful means tort\"). In its ruling in \"A.I. Enterprises Ltd. v. Bram Enterprises Ltd.\", it declared:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "298262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=298262", "title": "Ex post facto law", "text": "Ex post facto law\n\nAn ex post facto\" law (corrupted from ) is a law that retroactively changes the legal consequences (or status) of actions that were committed, or relationships that existed, before the enactment of the law. In criminal law, it may criminalize actions that were legal when committed; it may aggravate a crime by bringing it into a more severe category than it was in when it was committed; it may change the punishment prescribed for a crime, as by adding new penalties or extending sentences; or it may alter the rules of evidence in order to make conviction for a crime likelier than it would have been when the deed was committed. Conversely, a form of \"ex post facto\" law commonly called an \"amnesty law\" may decriminalize certain acts. A pardon has a similar effect, in a specific case instead of a class of cases. Other legal changes may alleviate possible punishments (for example by replacing the death sentence with lifelong imprisonment) retroactively. Such legal changes are also known by the Latin term in mitius\".\n\nSome common-law jurisdictions do not permit retroactive criminal legislation, though new precedent generally applies to events that occurred before the judicial decision. \"Ex post facto\" laws are expressly forbidden by the United States Constitution in Article 1, Section 9, Clause 3 (with respect to federal laws) and Article 1, Section 10 (with respect to state laws). In some nations that follow the Westminster system of government, such as the United Kingdom, \"ex post facto\" laws are technically possible, because the doctrine of parliamentary supremacy allows Parliament to pass any law it wishes. In a nation with an entrenched bill of rights or a written constitution, \"ex post facto\" legislation may be prohibited.\n\nWhile American jurisdictions generally prohibit \"ex post facto\" laws, European countries apply the principle of lex mitior (\"the milder law\"). It provides that, if the law has changed after an offense was committed, the version of the law that applies is the one that is more advantageous for the accused. This means that \"ex post facto\" laws apply in European jurisdictions to the extent that they are the milder law.\n\nAustralia has no strong constitutional prohibition on \"ex post facto\" laws, although narrowly retroactive laws might violate the constitutional separation of powers principle. Australian courts normally interpret statutes with a strong presumption that they do not apply retroactively.\n\nRetroactive laws designed to prosecute what was perceived to have been a blatantly unethical means of tax avoidance were passed in the early 1980s by the Fraser government (see Bottom of the harbour tax avoidance). Similarly, legislation criminalising certain war crimes retroactively has been held to be constitutional (see \"Polyukhovich v Commonwealth\").\n\nThe government will sometimes make a press release that it intends to change the tax law with effect from the date and time of the press release, before legislation is introduced into parliament.\n\nAccording to the 5th Article, section XXXVI of the Brazilian Constitution, laws cannot have \"ex post facto\" effects that affect acquired rights, accomplished juridical acts and \"res judicata\".\n\nThe same article in section XL prohibits \"ex post facto\" criminal laws. Like France, there is an exception when retroactive criminal laws benefit the accused person.\n\nIn Canada, \"ex post facto\" criminal laws are constitutionally prohibited by paragraph 11(g) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Also, under paragraph 11(i) of the Charter, if the punishment for a crime has varied between the time the crime was committed and the time of sentencing following a conviction, the convicted person is entitled to the lesser punishment.\n\nThe Canada sex offender registry, which went into effect on December 15, 2004, is somewhat retroactive. When the registry was created, all offenders who were on the Ontario sex offender registry, which was created in 2001, were required to register on the national registry. In addition, sex offenders in all provinces who were serving a sentence (whether imprisoned or on probation or parole) on December 15,2004 were required to register, regardless of when their offense and conviction occurred. However, the registry was not retroactive to anybody who had completed their sentence by late 2004 and was not on the Ontario registry. Canadian courts have never ruled on the somewhat retroactive nature of the sex offender registry, since this seems to have never been challenged. \n\nSex offender registration was not mandatory for sex offenders until 2011, and had to be ordered by a judge. . Somewhat bizarrely, sex offender registration was seemingly mandatory for people convicted before December 15, 2004 who were serving a sentence on that date, but was only optional for sex offenders convicted between December 15, 2004 and January 1, 2011. \n\nBecause section 11 of the Charter is among the sections that can be overridden under section 33 (the notwithstanding clause), Parliament could in theory enact \"ex post facto\" laws by invoking section 33. However, the federal Parliament (which has the sole power to enact laws punishable for violation by two years or more in penitentiary) has never attempted to enact an \"ex post facto\" law (or any other law) using section 33.\n\nIt should be emphasized that the Charter prohibition applies only to criminal law. Changes to civil law in Canada can be, and occasionally are, enacted \"ex post facto\". In one example, convicted murderer Colin Thatcher was ordered to forfeit proceeds from a book he had published (after being paroled from prison) under a Saskatchewan law. Although the law was passed long after Thatcher's murder conviction, the courts have ruled that such laws prescribe only civil penalties (as opposed to additional criminal penalties) and are thus not subject to Charter restrictions.\n\nGenerally, the Finnish legal system does not permit \"ex post facto\" laws, especially those that would expand criminal responsibility. They are not expressly forbidden; instead, the ban is derived from more general legal principles and basic rights. In civil matters, such as taxation, \"ex post facto\" laws may be made in some circumstances.\n\nHowever, there have been three exceptional instances when \"ex post facto\" criminal laws have been used in Finland.\n\nFollowing the Finnish Civil War of 1918, the Parliament of Finland passed a law setting up tribunals to try suspected rebels. These tribunals issued death sentences in many cases, although very few of those accused could have committed a crime that carried the death penalty under Finnish law in force during the war. Several hundred people were executed under what was arguably an \"ex post facto\" legal arrangement. During the war, and before the tribunals were set up, thousands of people had been executed without trial by both sides.\n\nAfter World War II, Finland was under pressure to convict political leaders whom the Allied powers considered responsible for Finnish involvement in the war. An \"ex post facto\" law was passed in the autumn of 1945 to permit prosecution for war responsibility, and eventually eight politicians were convicted.\n\nIn another post-war case, the weapons cache case, an \"ex post facto\" law was passed in 1947 so that military personnel could be prosecuted for unofficially preparing for guerrilla resistance in case of Soviet occupation.\n\nIn France, so-called \"lois rétroactives\" (retroactive laws) are technically prohibited by Article 2 of the Code Civil, which states that: \"Legislation provides only for the future; it has no retrospective operation\". In practice however, since the Code Civil does not have the status of constitutional legislation and can therefore be overruled by subsequent laws, the Conseil Constitutionnel has determined that retroactive laws can be passed within certain limits – such as in the case of financial or tax legislation –, particularly where it is considered to be in the \"general interest\"; this has been demonstrated by a series of decisions handed down by the Conseil Constitutionnel concerning retroactive tax laws.\n\nHowever, in criminal law, \"ex post facto\" sanctions are effectively forbidden as per Article 112-1 of the French Penal Code, except in cases wherein the retroactive application benefits the accused person (called retroactivity \"in mitius\"). They are also considered unconstitutional, since the principle of non-retroactivity is laid down in Article 8 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which has constitutional status under French law. The \"épuration légale\" trials held after the 1944 liberation of France introduced the status of \"indignité nationale\" for Nazi collaborators as a way to avoid \"ex post facto\" law.\n\nArticle 103 of the German basic law requires that an act may be punished only if it has already been punishable by law at the time it was committed (specifically: by \"written\" law, Germany following civil law).\n\nRobert A. Taft, at the time a U.S. Senator from Ohio, asserted that the Nuremberg Trials following World War II were based on \"ex post facto\" law because the Allies did not negotiate the London Charter, which defined crimes against humanity and created the International Military Tribunal, until well after the acts charged. Others, including the International Military Tribunal, argued that the London Charter merely restated and provided jurisdiction to prosecute offenses that were already made unlawful by the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the Covenant of the League of Nations, and the various Hague Conventions.\n\nThe problem of \"ex post facto\" law was also relevant in the 1990s as there was a discussion about the trials against East German soldiers who killed fugitives on the Inner-German border (\"Mauerschützen-Prozesse\" - \"Wall-shooters'/ -guards' trials\"). German courts in these cases recurred to the Radbruch formula.\n\nIn 2010, the parliament established a 98% punitive tax on any income over two million forints received either as a retirement package or as severance pay in the previous five years in the government sector.\n\nIn India, without using the expression \"ex post facto law\", the underlying principle has been adopted in the article 20(1) of the Indian Constitution in the following words:\nFurther, what article 20(1) prohibits is conviction and sentence under an \"ex post facto\" law for acts done prior thereto, but not the enactment or validity of such a law. There is, thus, a difference between the Indian and the American positions on this point; whereas in the United States, an \"ex post facto\" law is in itself invalid, it is not so in India. The courts may also interpret a law in such a manner that any objection against it of retrospective operation may be removed.\n\nAn example for retrospective law in India is the Karnataka Schedule Caste and Scheduled Tribes (Prohibition of Transfer of Certain Lands) Act, 1978 in the state of Karnataka.\n\nThe Indonesian constitution prohibits trying citizens under retroactive laws in any circumstance. This was tested in 2004 when the conviction of Masykur Abdul Kadir, one of the Bali bombers, under retroactive anti-terrorist legislation was quashed.\n\n\"Ex post facto\" laws, in all contexts, are prohibited by Article 169 (Chapter 11) of Iran's constitution.\n\nThe imposition of retroactive criminal sanctions is prohibited by Article 15.5.1° of the Irish constitution. Retroactive changes of the civil law have also been found to violate the constitution when they would have resulted in the loss in a right to damages before the courts, the Irish Supreme Court having found that such a right is a constitutionally protected property right.\n\nIsrael enacted the 1950 \"Nazi and Nazi Collaborators (Punishment) Law\" for the purpose of punishing acts that occurred during the Second World War, when Israel did not exist as a state. The law was used to punish Adolf Eichmann and others.\n\nArticle 25, paragraph 2, of the Italian Constitution, establishing that \"nobody can be punished but according to a law come into force before the deed was committed\", prohibits indictment pursuant a retroactive law. Article 11 of preliminary provisions to the Italian Civil Code and Article 3, paragraph 1, of the Statute of taxpayer's rights, prohibit retroactive laws on principle: such provisions can be derogated, however, by acts having force of the ordinary law; on the contrary, non-retroactivity in criminal law is thought absolute.\n\nArticle 39 of the constitution of Japan prohibits the retroactive application of laws. Article 6 of Criminal Code of Japan further states that if a new law comes into force after the deed was committed, the lighter punishment must be given.\n\nLithuania has no constitutional prohibition on \"ex post facto\" laws. Retroactive criminal sanctions are prohibited by Article 2, Part 1 (Chapter 1) of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Lithuania. Retroactive administrative sanctions are prohibited by Article 8 of the Administrative Code of the Republic of Lithuania.\n\nLithuanian lawyer Dainius Žalimas contends that there has been retroactive application of the law on Genocide (and subsequently adopted articles of the Criminal Code) against participants in Soviet repressions against Lithuanian guerilla fighters and their supporters, and gives examples of such decisions. The Article 99 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Lithuania was introduced only in September 26, 2000 and therefore can't be used in events of 1944-1953.\n\nAccording to the first and second paragraphs of the Article 14th of the Mexican Constitution, retroactive application of the law is prohibited if it is on detriment of a person rights. But the new law can be applied if it benefits the person.\n\nArticle 4 of the Law on General Provisions (in effect since 1838) states that \"The law has no retroactive effect\".\n\nArticle 1 of Criminal Law states that no act is punishable without a pre-existing law, and that in the case an act was punishable but the law was changed after the criminal act the \"most favorable\" (to the suspect) of the two laws will apply.\n\nIn Civil Law there is no such provision.\n\nSection 7 of the Interpretation Act 1999 stipulates that enactments do not have retrospective effect. The New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 also affirms New Zealand's commitment to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Universal Declaration of Human Rights, with section 26 preventing the application of retroactive penalties. This is further reinforced under section 6(1) of the current Sentencing Act 2002 which provides, \"[p]enal enactments not to have retrospective effect to disadvantage of offender\" irrespective of any provision to the contrary.\n\nSection 26 of the Bill of Rights and the previous sentencing legislation, the Criminal Justice Act 1985, caused significant digression among judges when the New Zealand Parliament introduced legislation that had the effect of enacting a retrospective penalty for crimes involving an element of home invasion. Ultimately, the discrepancy was restricted with what some labelled artificial logic in the cases of \"R v Pora\" and \"R v Poumako\".\n\nArticle 97 of the Norwegian constitution prohibits any law to be given retroactive effect. The prohibition applies to both criminal and civil laws, but in some civil cases, only particularly unreasonable effects of retroactivity will be found unconstitutional.\n\nArticle 12 of the constitution of Pakistan prohibits any law to be given retroactive effect by stating:\n\nThe 1987 Constitution of the Philippines categorically prohibits the passing of any \"ex post facto\" law. Article III (Bill of Rights), Section 22 specifically states: \"No \"ex post facto\" law or bill of attainder shall be enacted.\"\n\nHowever, the Cybercrime Prevention Act, which went into effect on October 3, 2012, is criticized for being \"ex post facto\".\n\nRetroactive application of law is prohibited by the Article 3 of the Polish civil code, and the legal rule prohibiting such retroactive application is commonly memorised as a Latin sentence \"Lex retro non agit\" (\"A law does not apply retroactively\"). The said article, however, allows retroactive application of an Act of Parliament if it is expressly understood from its text or purpose.\n\nArticle 18 of the Portuguese constitution forbids the retroactive application of any law the restricts right; article 29 of the Portuguese Constitution forbids retroactive application of criminal law; article 103 forbids the application of retroactive taxes.\n\nArticle 15 (2) of the Romanian constitution provides that the law shall only act for the future, except for the more favourable criminal or administrative law.\n\n\"Ex post facto\" punishment in criminal and administrative law is prohibited by article 54 of the constitution; \"ex post facto\" tax laws by article 57 of the constitution.\n\nArticle 9.3 of the Spanish Constitution guarantees the principle of non-retroactivity of punitive provisions that are not favorable to or restrictive of individual rights. Therefore, \"ex post facto\" criminal laws or any other retroactive punitive provisions are constitutionally prohibited.\n\nAs well as Statute law mentioned above, this now also includes 'court-made law'. The Parot doctrine, in which terrorists were denied the right (enshrined in a 1973 Statute) to earn a reduction in the length of their sentences by a Spanish court ruling in 2006 was judged by the European Court of Human Rights to be contrary to relevant articles on retroactivity & liberty and security in 2013.\n\nSection 35(3) of the South African Bill of Rights prohibits \"ex post facto\" criminal laws, except that acts which violated international law at the time they were committed may be prosecuted even if they were not illegal under national law at the time. It also prohibits retroactive increases of criminal punishments.\n\nIn Sweden, retroactive penal sanctions and other retroactive legal effects of criminal acts due the State are prohibited by chapter 2, section 10 of the Instrument of Government (\"Regeringsformen\"). Retroactive taxes or charges are not prohibited, but they can have retroactive effect reaching back only to the time when a new tax bill was proposed by the government. The retroactive effect of a tax or charge thus reaches from that time until the bill is passed by the parliament.\n\nAs the Swedish Act of Succession was changed in 1979, and the throne was inherited regardless of sex, the inheritance right was withdrawn from all the descendants of Charles XIV John (king 1818-44) except the current king Carl XVI Gustaf. Thereby, the heir-apparent title was transferred from the new-born Prince Carl Philip to his older sister Crown Princess Victoria.\n\nThe Swedish Parliament voted in 2004 to abolish inheritance tax by January 1, 2005. However, in 2005 they retro-actively decided to move the date to December 17, 2004. The main reason was abolishing inheritance tax for the many Swedish victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, which took place on December 26.\n\n\"Ex post facto\" punishment is prohibited by Article 38 of the Constitution of Turkey. It states:\nThus, the article does not prohibit \"in mitius\" laws, i.e. cases wherein the retroactive application benefits the accused person.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"ex post facto\" laws are frowned upon, but are permitted by virtue of the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty. Historically, all acts of Parliament before 1793 were \"ex post facto\" legislation, inasmuch as their date of effect was the first day of the session in which they were passed. This situation was rectified by the Acts of Parliament (Commencement) Act 1793.\n\nSome laws are still passed retrospectively: e.g., the Pakistan Act 1990 (by which the United Kingdom amended its legislation consequent to the Commonwealth of Nations having re-admitted Pakistan as a member) was one such law; despite being passed on 29 June 1990, section 2 subsection 3 states that \"This Act shall be deemed to have come into force on 1st October 1989\", nine months before it was enacted.\n\nRetrospective \"criminal\" laws are prohibited by Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights, to which the United Kingdom is a signatory, but several noted legal authorities have stated their opinion that parliamentary sovereignty takes priority even over this. For example, the War Crimes Act 1991 created an \"ex post facto\" jurisdiction of British courts over war crimes committed during the Second World War. Another important example of a case which shows the doctrine of parliamentary supremacy in action is Burmah Oil Co Ltd v Lord Advocate, which retrospectively changed the law on compensation resulting from scorched earth actions in Burma during the war. The decision of the courts was overriden with retrospective effect by the War Damage Act 1965. More recently, the Police (Detention and Bail) Act 2011 retroactively overrode a controversial court judgment resulting from an error in the drafting of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 that would potentially have invalidated thousands of criminal convictions.\n\nOne example of an ex post facto criminal law in the UK is the Criminal Justice Act 2003. This law allows people acquitted of murder and certain other serious offences to be retried if there is “new, compelling, reliable and substantial evidence” that the acquitted person really was guilty. This Act applies retroactively and can be used to re-prosecute people who were acquitted before it came into force in 2005, or even before it was passed in 2003. As a result, two of the defendants who were acquitted in the murder of Stephen Lawrence were allowed to be retried, even though this murder occurred in 1993 and the defendants had been acquitted in 1996. Many people have criticized the Criminal Justice Act because of its essential abolition of prohibition against both ex post facto and double jeopardy laws.\n\nTaxation law has on multiple occasions been changed to retrospectively disallow tax avoidance schemes.\nThe most significant example known concerns Double-taxation Treaty Arrangements where the Finance Act 2008 with BN66 retrospectively amended 1987 legislation creating large tax liabilities for 3,000 people where no liability existed before. More recently, the so called \"2019 Loan Charge\", coming in from 5 April 2019 and going back 20 years retrospectively has triggered an Early Day Motion in UK Parliament and the establishment of a Loan Charge Action Group. It has since transpired that Mel Stride, Financial Secretary to the Treasury and Paymaster General Her Majesty's Treasury, misled UK Parliament stating that “the arrangements entered into by those who are in scope of this measure [the 2019 Loan Charge] were not legal when they were entered into, even though they may have been entered into in the past”. The Loan Charge Action Group has since written to demand a formal apology and correction of parliamentary record.\n\nIn the United States, Congress is prohibited from passing \"ex post facto\" laws by clause 3 of Article I, of the United States Constitution. The states are prohibited from passing \"ex post facto\" laws by clause 1 of Article I, . This is one of the relatively few restrictions that the United States Constitution made to both the power of the federal and state governments before the Fourteenth Amendment. Thomas Jefferson described them as \"equally unjust in civil as in criminal cases\". Over the years, however, when deciding \"ex post facto\" cases, the United States Supreme Court has referred repeatedly to its ruling in \"Calder v. Bull\", in which Justice Samuel Chase held that the prohibition applied only to criminal matters, not civil matters, and established four categories of unconstitutional \"ex post facto\" laws. The case dealt with the Article I, Section 10, prohibition on \"ex post facto\" laws, because it concerned a Connecticut state law.\n\nNot all laws with retroactive effects have been held to be unconstitutional. One current U.S. law that has a retroactive effect is the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006. This law imposes new registration requirements on convicted sex offenders and also applies to offenders whose crimes were committed before the law was enacted. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in \"Smith v. Doe\" (2003) that forcing sex offenders to register their whereabouts at regular intervals, and the posting of personal information about them on the Internet, do not violate the constitutional prohibition against \"ex post facto\" laws, because these laws do not impose any kind of punishment.\n\nIn \"Starkey v. Oklahoma Department Of Corrections\", the Supreme Court of the State of Oklahoma found the Oklahoma Sex Offender Registration Act, or SORA, to be punitive in nature, if not in intent. While the law in question has been ruled as not being retroactive in nature, the Oklahoma Department of Corrections had been applying the new legislation retroactively, and \"also find the Department's retroactive application of the level assignment provisions of 57 O.S. Supp. 2007, 582.1 - 582.5, as amended, violates the ex post facto clause.\"\n\nControversy has also arisen with regard to sexually violent predator (SVP) laws, which allow the indefinite commitment of a person with a mental abnormality which predisposes them to molest children. This issue arose in the case \"Kansas v. Hendricks\". In \"Hendricks\", a man with a long history of sexually molesting children was scheduled to be released from prison shortly after the enactment of Kansas's SVP act. Rather than being released, he was committed on the grounds that he had a mental abnormality. Hendricks contested the law on \"ex post facto\" and double jeopardy grounds. The Supreme Court of Kansas invalidated the Act, but the Supreme Court of the United States reversed the decision and ruled that the law was constitutional on the basis that the law did not impose a criminal punishment.\n\nAnother example is the Domestic Violence Offender Gun Ban, where firearms prohibitions were imposed on those convicted of misdemeanor domestic-violence offenses and on subjects of restraining orders (which do not require criminal conviction). These individuals can now be sentenced to up to ten years in a federal prison for possession of a firearm, regardless of whether the weapon was legally possessed when the law was passed. The law has been legally upheld because it is considered regulatory, not punitive; it is a status offense.\n\nFinally, in \"Calder v. Bull\", the court expressly stated that a law that \"mollifies\" a criminal act was merely retrospective, and was not an \"ex post facto\" law. Scholars have argued that, as a historical matter, the phrase \"ex post facto\" referred to civil as well as criminal laws.\n\nIn administrative law, federal agencies may apply their rules retroactively if Congress has authorized them to; otherwise, retroactive application is generally prohibited. Retroactive application of regulations is disfavored by the courts for several reasons. The courts uphold retroactive regulation where Congress has expressly granted such retroactive power to the agency, as they did in \"Bowen v. Georgetown University Hospital\".\n\nThe rules as they relate to the effects of \"ex post facto\" upon the U.S. Federal Sentencing Guidelines can be found in .\n\nSee also \"Bouie v. City of Columbia\", \"Rogers v. Tennessee\", \"Stogner v. California\", \"Republic of Austria v. Altmann\", \"James Bamford\" and \"Samuels v. McCurdy\".\n\nIn international criminal law, the Nuremberg trials prosecuted war crimes and crimes against humanity perpetrated in World War II. Although the Nuremberg Charter, the procedural law under which the trials were held, postdated V-E Day, the tribunal rejected the defence that the criminal law was \"ex post facto\", arguing it derived from earlier treaties like the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907. The International Criminal Court established in 2002 cannot prosecute crimes committed before 2002.\n\nArticle 11, paragraph 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides that no person be held guilty of any criminal law that did not exist at the time of offence nor suffer any penalty heavier than what existed at the time of offence. It does however permit application of either domestic or international law.\n\nVery similar provisions are found in Article 15, paragraph 1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, replacing the term \"penal offence\" with \"criminal offence\". It also adds that if a lighter penalty is provided for after the offence occurs, that lighter penalty shall apply retroactively. Paragraph 2 adds a provision that paragraph 1 does not prevent trying and punishing for an act that was criminal according to the general principles of law recognized by the community of nations. Specifically addressing the use of the death penalty, article 6, paragraph 2 provides in relevant part that a death sentence may only be imposed \"for the most serious crimes in accordance with the law in force at the time of the commission of the crime\".\n\nArticle 2, paragraph 7 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights provides in part that \"[n]o one may be condemned for an act or omission which did not constitute a legally punishable offense at the time it was committed. No penalty may be inflicted for an offense for which no provision was made at the time it was committed.\"\n\nArticle 25 of the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man provides in part that \"[n]o person may be deprived of his liberty except in the cases and according to the procedures established by pre-existing law.\" The right to be tried in accordance to \"pre-existing law\" is reiterated in article 26.\n\nArticle 15 of the Arab Charter on Human Rights provides that \"[n]o crime and no penalty can be established without a prior provision of the law. In all circumstances, the law most favorable to the defendant shall be applied.\"\n\nEffectively all European states (except Belarus), including all European Union and European Economic Area states, are bound by the European Convention on Human Rights. Article 7 of the convention mirrors the language of both paragraphs of Article 15 of the International Covenant on Political and Civil Rights, with the exception that it does not include that a subsequent lighter penalty must apply.\n\nThe phrase may not appear to be grammatically correct in Latin if it is interpreted to comprise the preposition \"ex\", the preposition \"post\", and a noun with the wrong grammatical case to agree with \"post\". Indeed, the \"Digesta Iustiniani\" (15.3.10.8.3, 20.1.22.pr2, etc.) shows a two-word phrase, \"ex postfacto\": \"out of a postfactum (an after-deed)\", or more naturally, \"from a law passed afterward\". This same work, however, also makes use of the three-word phrase \"ex post facto\", (2.14.17.4.2, 4.6.17.1.1, \"passim\"), suggesting that \"post\" might best be understood as an adverb. This adverbial usage of \"post\" is not at all unusual. For example, the Classical author/advocate/politician Marcus Tullius Cicero employs phrases such as \"multis post annis\" (\"De Re Publica\" 2.5.8 and elsewhere).\n\nTherefore, \"ex post facto\" or \"ex postfacto\" is natively an adverbial phrase, a usage demonstrated by the sentence \"He was convicted \"ex post facto\" (from a law passed after his crime).\" The law itself would rightfully be a \"postfactum\" law (\"lex postfacta\"); nevertheless, despite its redundant or circular nature, the phrase \"an ex post facto law\" is used.\n\nIn Poland the phrase \"\" (\"the law does not operate retroactively\") is often used.\n\n"}
{"id": "43417032", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43417032", "title": "Extraterritorial operation", "text": "Extraterritorial operation\n\nAn extraterritorial operation in international law is a law enforcement or military operation conducted outside the territory or jurisdiction of the state of the forces in operation, generally within the territory of another sovereign state. Under international law, these activities are generally highly restricted, and it is considered a violation of a state's sovereignty if any other state engages in law enforcement or military operations within another state without gaining that state's consent:\nThe policing of transnational and international crimes is a challenge to state-based law enforcement agencies, as jurisdiction restricts the direct intervention a state's agencies can legally take in another state's jurisdiction, with even basic law enforcement activities such as arrest and detention \"tantamount to abduction\" when carried out extraterritorially. These explicit limits on extraterritorial law enforcement operations has therefore instead encouraged co-operation between law enforcement agencies of sovereign states, forming supranational agencies such as Interpol to encourage co-operation, and placing additional obligations on the state such as \"aut dedere aut judicare\" (\"extradite or prosecute\") to compel prosecution of certain types of transnational crime, including hijacking of civilian aircraft, taking of civilian hostages, and other acts of terrorism, as well as crimes against diplomats and other \"internationally protected persons\".\n\nWhile extraterritorial law enforcement activity is highly restricted and subject to the approval of the 'host' state, traditional interstate military operations assume some degree of extraterritorial operation. As Stigall points out, innate in 'just' war (\"jus ad bellum\") is the expectation that one state may be conducting military activity against, and within the borders, of another state; the laws of armed conflict \"[presuppose] extraterritoriality\". Therefore, \"[i]f the circumstances exist for the \nlawful use of force under \"jus ad bellum\", then so long as a state abides by the rules articulated in \"jus in bello\" [the law of war], that state’s extraterritorial actions are considered lawful.\"\n\nProblems with the legitimacy of extraterritorial operations arise, according to Stigall, when one state is conducting military activity against non-state actors in a state \"that is not party to the conflict\". Although some commentators suggest that the use of force is permitted in some of these cases, with Deeks' commentary on the 'Unwilling or Unable Test' mentioning sources that recommend that \"neutrality law permits a belligerent to use force on a neutral state’s territory if the neutral state is unable or unwilling to prevent violations of its neutrality by another belligerent\", Stigall reminds \"that such view is not universal, and textual authority for such cross-border attacks is limited\".\n\nFor the European Union, key tenets of its human rights law jurisdiction are laid down in Article 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), with the convention employed to complement and reinforce the more specific scope of humanitarian law. The application of this to extraterritorial operations has been noted by Ryngaert as mixed, with \"Al-Skeini and others v United Kingdom\" in 2011 attempting \"to square \"Bankovic \"[\"v. Belgium\"'s \"sufficient control\" model of jurisdiction] with the personal model of jurisdiction\", and \"Al-Jedda v United Kingdom\" \"tried to reconcile the ‘ultimate control and authority’ standard... with the ‘effective operational control’ standard endorsed by the UN’s International Law Commission.\" Ryngaert declares each of the two results to be \"an awkward hybrid theory\".\n\n"}
{"id": "272522", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=272522", "title": "FM broadcast band", "text": "FM broadcast band\n\nThe FM broadcast band, used for FM broadcast radio by radio stations, differs between different parts of the world. In Europe, Australia and Africa ((defined as International Telecommunication Union (ITU) region 1)), it spans from 87.5 to 108 megahertz (MHz) - also known as VHF Band II - while in the Americas (ITU region 2) it ranges from 88 to 108 MHz. The FM broadcast band in Japan uses 76 to 95 MHz. The International Radio and Television Organisation (OIRT) band in Eastern Europe is from 65.8 to 74.0 MHz, although these countries now primarily use the 87.5 to 108 MHz band, as in the case of Russia. Some other countries have already discontinued the OIRT band and have changed to the 87.5 to 108 MHz band.\n\nFrequency modulation radio originated in the United States during the 1930s; the system was developed by the American electrical engineer Edwin Howard Armstrong. However, FM broadcasting did not become widespread, even in North America, until the 1960s.\n\nFrequency-modulated radio waves can be generated at any frequency. All the bands mentioned in this article are in the very high frequency (VHF) range, which extends from 30 to 300 MHz.\n\nWhile all countries use FM channel center frequencies ending in 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9 MHz, some countries also use center frequencies ending in 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 MHz. A few others also use 0.05, 0.15, 0.25, 0.35, 0.45, 0.55, 0.65, 0.75, 0.85, and 0.95 MHz.\n\nAn ITU conference in Geneva, Switzerland, on December 7, 1984, resolved to discontinue the use of 50 kHz channel spacings throughout Europe.\n\nThe original frequency allocation in North America used by Edwin Armstrong used the frequency band from 42 through 50 MHz, but this allocation was changed to a higher band beginning in 1945. In Canada, the United States, Mexico, the Bahamas, etc., there are 101 FM channels numbered from \"200\" (center frequency 87.9 MHz) to \"300\" (center frequency 107.9 MHz), though these numbers are rarely used outside the fields of radio engineering and government.\nThe center frequencies of the FM channels are spaced in increments of 200 kHz. The frequency of 87.9 MHz, while technically part of TV channel 6 (82 to 88 MHz), is used by just two FM class-D stations in the United States. Portable radio tuners often tune down to 87.5 MHz, so that the same radios can be made and sold worldwide. Automobiles usually have FM radios that can tune down to 87.7 MHz, so that TV channel 6's audio at 87.75 MHz (±10 kHz) could be received, such as in Birmingham, Alabama, and Denver, Colorado. With the advent of digital television in the United States, this ability will soon be irrelevant when the remaining analog LPTV stations are required by the FCC to shut down or convert to digital by September 2015—but there are still analog television stations in the sparsely-populated regions of northern Canada. There are also analog TV stations on the other continents and on scores of different islands.\n\nIn the United States, the twenty-one channels with center frequencies of 87.9–91.9 MHz (channels 200 through 220) constitute the \"reserved band\", exclusively for non-commercial educational (\"NCE\") stations. The other channels (92.1 MHz through 107.9 MHz (Channels 221–300) may be used by both commercial and non-commercial stations. (Note that in Canada and in Mexico this reservation does not apply.)\n\nOriginally, the American Federal Communications Commission (FCC) devised a bandplan in which FM radio stations would be assigned at intervals of four channels (800 kHz separation) for any one geographic area. Thus, in one area, stations might be at 88.1, 88.9, 89.7, etc., while in an adjacent area, stations might be at 88.3, 89.1, 89.9, 90.7 etc. Certain frequencies were designated for Class A only (see FM broadcasting), which had a limit of three kilowatts of effective radiated power (ERP) and an antenna height limit for the center of radiation of 300 feet (91.4 m) height above average terrain (HAAT). These frequencies were 92.1, 92.7, 93.5, 94.3, 95.3, 95.9, 96.7, 97.7, 98.3, 99.3, 100.1, 100.9, 101.7, 102.3, 103.1, 103.9, 104.9, 105.5, 106.3 and 107.1. On other frequencies, a station could be Class B (50 kW, 500 feet) or Class C (100 kW, 2000 feet), depending on which zone it was in.\n\nIn the late 1980s, the FCC switched to a bandplan based on a distance separation table using currently operating stations, and subdivided the class table to create extra classes and change antenna height limits to meters. Class A power was doubled to six kilowatts, and the frequency restrictions noted above were removed. As of late 2004, a station can be \"squeezed in\" anywhere as long as the location and class conform to the rules in the FCC separation table. The rules for second-adjacent-channel spacing do not apply for stations licensed before 1964.\n\nNormally each channel is 200 kHz (0.2 MHz) wide, and can pass audio and subcarrier frequencies up to 100 kHz. Deviation is typically limited to 150 kHz total (±75 kHz) in order to prevent adjacent channel interference on the band. Stations in the U.S. may go up to 10% over this limit if they use non-stereo subcarriers, increasing total modulation by 0.5% for each 1% used by the subcarriers.\n\nThe OIRT FM broadcast band covers 65.9 to 74 MHz. It was used in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and most of the other Warsaw pact member countries of the International Radio and Television Organisation in Eastern Europe (OIRT), with the exception of East Germany, which always used the 87.5 to 100 (later 104) MHz broadcast band—in line with Western Europe.\n\nThe lower portion of the VHF band behaves a bit like shortwave radio in that it has a longer reach than the upper portion of the VHF band. It was ideally suited for reaching vast and remote areas that would otherwise lack FM radio reception. In a way, FM suited this band because the capture effect of FM could mitigate interference from skywaves.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the communist governments in Eastern Europe, the 87.5 to 108 MHz band began to be adopted and is now in use in all those countries. This was prompted by the lack of equipment for the band and the modernisation of existing transmission networks.\n\nMany countries have completely ceased broadcasting on the OIRT FM band, although use continues in others, mainly the former republics of the USSR. The future of broadcasting on the OIRT FM band is limited, due to the lack of new consumer receivers for this band outside of Russia.\n\nCountries which still use the OIRT band are Russia (including Kaliningrad), Belarus, Moldova, Ukraine and Turkmenistan.\n\nHungary closed down its remaining broadcast transmitters in 2007, and for thirty days in July of that year, several Hungarian amateur radio operators received a temporary experimental permit to perform propagation and interference experiments in the 70–70.5 MHz band.\n\nIn Belarus, only government-run public radio stations are still active on OIRT. All stations on OIRT in Belarus are a mirror of normal FM broadcasts. The main purpose of those stations is compatibility with older equipment.\n\nIn 2014, Russia began replacing OIRT-banded transmitter with CCIR-banded (the \"western\") FM transmitters. The main reason for the change to CCIR FM is to reach more listeners.\n\nUnlike Western practice, OIRT FM frequencies are based on 30 kHz rather than 50, 100 or 200 kHz multiples. This may have been to reduce co-channel interference caused by Sporadic E propagation and other atmospheric effects, which occur more often at these frequencies. However, multipath distortion effects are less annoying than on the CCIR band.\n\nStereo is generally achieved by sending the stereo difference signal, using a process called polar modulation. Polar modulation uses a reduced subcarrier on 31.25 kHz with the audio on both side-bands. This gives the following signal structure: L + R --> 31.25 kHz reduced subcarrier L - R.\n\nThe 4-meter band (70–70.5 MHz) amateur radio allocation used in many European countries is entirely within the OIRT FM band. Operators on this band and the 6-meter band (50–54 MHz) use the presence of broadcast stations as an indication that there is an \"opening\" into Eastern Europe or Russia. This can be a mixed blessing because the 4 meter amateur allocation is only 0.5 MHz or less, and a single broadcast station causes considerable interference to a large part of the band.\n\nThe System D television channels R4 and R5 lie wholly or partly within the 87.5–108 MHz FM audio broadcast band. Countries which still use System D therefore have to consider the re-organisation of TV broadcasting in order to make full use of this band for audio broadcasting.\n\nThe FM band in Japan is 76–95 MHz (previously 76–90). The 90–108 MHz section was used for analog VHF TV Channels 1, 2 and 3 (each NTSC television channel was 6 MHz wide). The narrowness of the Japanese band (19 MHz compared to slightly more than 20 MHz for the CCIR band) limits the number of FM stations that can be accommodated on the dial with the result that many commercial radio stations are forced to use AM. \n\nMany Japanese radios are capable of receiving both the Japanese FM band and the CCIR FM band, so that the same model can be sold within Japan or exported. The radio may cover 76 to 108 MHz, the frequency coverage may be selectable by the user, or during assembly the radio may be set to operate on one band by means of a specially placed diode or other internal component.\n\nConventional analog-tuned (dial & pointer) radios may be marked with \"TV Sound\" in the 90–108 section. If these radios were sold in the US, for example, the 76–88 section would be marked TV sound for VHF channels 5 and 6 (as two 6 MHz-wide NTSC TV channels), with the 88–108 section band as normal FM.\n\nSecond-hand automobiles imported from Japan contain a radio designed for the Japanese FM band, and importers often fit a \"converter\" to down-convert the 87.5 to 107.9 MHz band to the frequencies that the radio can accept. In addition to showing an incorrect frequency, there are two other disadvantages that can result in undesired performance; the converter cannot down-convert in full the regular international FM band (up to 20.5 MHz wide) to the only 14 MHz-wide Japanese band (unless the converter incorporates two user-switchable down-convert modes), and the car's antenna may perform poorly on the higher FM band. Some converters simply down-convert the FM band by 12 MHz, leading to logical frequencies (e.g. 78.9 for 90.9, 82.3 for 94.3, etc.), but leaving off the 102–108 MHz band. Also, RDS is not used in Japan, whereas most modern car radios available in Europe have this system. Also the converter may not allow pass-through of the MW band, which is used for AM broadcasting. A better solution is to replace the radio and antenna with ones designed for the country where the car will be used.\nAustralia had a similar situation with Australian TV channels 3, 4 and 5 that are between 88 and 108 MHz, and was intending to follow Japan, but in the end opted for the western bandplan, due to CCIR radios that entered the country. There were some radios sold in Australia for 76 to 90 MHz.\n\nEarly FM broadcasting in North America originally used the 42–50 MHz band (this range was also used by a class of experimental wideband AM stations known as apex broadcasters). In 1941, the Yankee Network, which was already using FM for AM station feeds, started operating a station, W39B, in this band from a transmitter atop Mount Washington, New Hampshire, the highest point in the northeast United States. (Studios were in Boston.) In 1945 the United States FCC decided to move FM broadcasters to the 88.1–105.9 MHz band (later extended to 107.9 MHz); this made all the existing FM radios useless, although converters could be purchased. It was even more expensive for broadcasters to rebuild their transmitters to work on the new band. Altogether, the change set FM radio back ten years.\n\nThe \"devastating\" change was successfully lobbied for (with the FCC) by RCA, which did not want FM radio to become dominant, although the higher frequencies had fewer interference problems. RCA conducted \"an organized campaign of misinformation\". This protected RCA's and other networks' investments in AM radio, and avoided competition with television, which RCA wanted to focus on.\n\nIn March 2008, the FCC requested public comment on turning the bandwidth currently occupied by analog television channels 5 and 6 (76–88 MHz) over to extending the FM broadcast band when the digital television transition was to be completed in February 2009 (ultimately delayed to June 2009). This proposed allocation would effectively assign frequencies corresponding to the existing Japanese FM radio service (which begins at 76 MHz) for use as an extension to the existing North American FM broadcast band.\n\nWith the invention of DAB+ radio, some countries have planned and started a FM radio switch-off. Norway, in January 2018, was the first country to discontinue FM as a result.\n\n"}

They have been defined as prolonged wall-standing, hooding, subjection to noise, deprivation of sleep, and deprivation of food and drink.\n\nThey were first used in Northern Ireland in 1971 as part of Operation Demetrius – the mass arrest and internment (imprisonment without trial) of people suspected of involvement with the Irish Republican Army (IRA). Out of those arrested, fourteen were subjected to a programme of \"deep interrogation\" using the five techniques. This took place at a secret interrogation centre in Northern Ireland. For seven days, when not being interrogated, the detainees were kept hooded and handcuffed in a cold cell and subjected to a continuous loud hissing noise. Here they were forced to stand in a stress position for many hours and were deprived of sleep, food and drink. They were also repeatedly beaten, and some reported being kicked in the genitals, having their heads banged against walls and being threatened with injections. The effect was prolonged pain, physical and mental exhaustion, severe anxiety, depression, hallucinations, disorientation and repeated loss of consciousness. It also resulted in long-term psychological trauma. The fourteen became known as \"the Hooded Men\" and were the only detainees in Northern Ireland subjected to all five techniques together. Other detainees were subjected to at least one of the five techniques along with other interrogation methods.\n\nIn 1976, the European Commission of Human Rights ruled that the five techniques amounted to torture. The case was then referred to the European Court of Human Rights. In 1978 the court ruled that the techniques were \"inhuman and degrading\" and breached the European Convention on Human Rights, but did not amount to \"torture\". In 2014, after new information was uncovered that showed the decision to use methods of torture in Northern Ireland in 1971-1972 had been taken by ministers, the Irish Government asked the European Court of Human Rights to review its judgement and acknowledge the five techniques as torture.\n\nThe Court's ruling that the five techniques did not amount to torture was later cited by the United States and Israel to justify their own interrogation methods, which included the five techniques. British agents also taught the five techniques to the forces of Brazil's military dictatorship.\n\nDuring the Iraq War, the illegal use of the five techniques by British soldiers contributed to the death of Baha Mousa.\n\nIn response to the public and Parliamentary disquiet on 16 November 1971, the Government commissioned a committee of inquiry chaired by Lord Parker, the Lord Chief Justice of England to look into the legal and moral aspects of the use of the five techniques.\n\nThe \"Parker Report\" was published on 2 March 1972, and had found the five techniques to be illegal under domestic law:\nOn the same day (2 March 1972), the United Kingdom Prime Minister Edward Heath stated in the House of Commons:\n\nDirectives expressly prohibiting the use of the techniques, whether singly or in combination, were then issued to the security forces by the Government. These are still in force and the use of such methods by UK security forces would not be condoned by the Government.\n\nThe Irish Government, on behalf of the men who had been subject to the five methods, took a case to the\nEuropean Commission on Human Rights. The Commission stated that it\n\"considered the combined use of the five methods to amount to torture, on the grounds that (1) the intensity of the stress caused by techniques creating sensory deprivation \"directly affects the personality physically and mentally\"; and (2) \"the systematic application of the techniques for the purpose of inducing a person to give information shows a clear resemblance to those methods of systematic torture which have been known over the ages... a modern system of torture falling into the same category as those systems... applied in previous times as a means of obtaining information and confessions\".\n\nThe Commission's findings were appealed. In 1978, in the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) trial \"Ireland v. United Kingdom\" (5310/71) [1978] ECHR 1, the facts were not in dispute and the judges court published the following in their judgement:\nThese were referred to by the court as the five techniques. The court ruled:\nOn 8 February 1977, in proceedings before the ECHR, and in line with the findings of the Parker report and United Kingdom Government policy, the Attorney-General of the United Kingdom stated that\n\nOn 2 December 2014, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Charles Flanagan TD announced that the Irish Government had asked European Court of Human Rights to revise its judgment, following evidence uncovered by an RTÉ documentary called The Torture Files.\n\nIn 2018, the European Court of Human Rights decided not to revise its judgment, by six votes to one.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1012962", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1012962", "title": "George Witton", "text": "George Witton\n\nGeorge Ramsdale Witton (1874 – 14 August 1942) was a lieutenant in the Bushveldt Carbineers in the Boer War in South Africa.\n\nHe was sentenced to death for murder after the shooting of nine Boer prisoners. He was subsequently reprieved by Lieutenant-General Viscount Kitchener, although Lieutenants Peter Handcock and Harry \"Breaker\" Morant who had been court martialed with him were executed by firing squad on 27 February 1902.\n\nWitton was born into a farming family near Warrnambool, Victoria, Australia. He served as a gunner in the Royal Australian Artillery, then enlisted in the Victorian Imperial Bushmen for the Boer War and was promoted from Corporal to Squadron Quartermaster-Sergeant. Major Robert Lenehan then enlisted him into the Bushveldt Carbineers with a commission as Lieutenant.\n\nAfter the killing of a number of Boer prisoners, Witton was one of four officers charged by the British Army with murder, and was convicted. However, he strongly protested and secured a legal opinion from Isaac Isaacs KC, an Australian member of parliament, who recommended that he petition HM the King for a pardon.\nKitchener commuted Witton's sentence to life imprisonment. After further protests, he was released on 11 August 1904, although not pardoned. He had been ill twice in prison in England, once from arsenic fumes in a metal shop and once from typhoid fever. He returned to Australia on 12 November 1904, embittered after three years in prison, and wrote a book giving his version of the events involving Morant, Handcock and the BVC.\n\nHis book, \"Scapegoats of the Empire\" was originally published in 1907 by D. W. Paterson of Melbourne, but was long unavailable. It is claimed that prior to its reprint in 1982 by the Australian publishing house Angus & Robertson, only seven copies of the book survived in various Australian state libraries and in the possession of Witton's family. Although unsubstantiated, it has long been claimed that the book was suppressed by the Australian government and most copies were destroyed; another explanation is that most of the copies were destroyed in an accidental fire at the publisher's warehouse. The 1982 reprinting was inspired by the success of a film based on the book, entitled \"Breaker Morant\". George Witton's cousin, Cecily Adams of Castlecrag Sydney, owned the copyright for \"Scapegoats of the Empire\" following George's death. Cecily was also aware of some additional documentation written by George Witton, which he had asked not to be released until after his death. Cecily was determined that a further edition, which included this additional material, should be published and in 1989 an edition was published by ADLIB BOOKS of Bath, by arrangement with Cecily Adams as the copyright owner and Angus & Robertson (UK). \n\nWitton's main assertion, as indicated by the book's provocative title, was that he, Morant, and Handcock were made scapegoats by the British authorities in South Africa — that they were made to take the blame for widespread British war crimes against the Boers, and that the trial and executions were carried out by the British for political reasons, partly to cover up a controversial and secret \"no prisoners\" policy promulgated by Kitchener, and partly to appease the Boer government over the killing of Boer prisoners, in order to facilitate a peace treaty; the Treaty of Vereeniging was signed on 31 May 1902.\n\nWitton also claimed that many of the accusations about them, which led to their arrest and trial, were made by disaffected members of their regiment whose rebellious behaviour had been suppressed by Morant and Handcock.\n\nWhen World War I broke out, an embittered Witton did not rush to enlist. After former and future Prime Minister Andrew Fisher pledged during the 1914 general election that Australia would defend Britain \"to the last man and last shilling,\" Witton intimated that he would be that last man. He lived in Gippsland, Victoria and in Queensland where he was a dairy farmer. He married twice, but did not have any children. He had a heart attack while cranking his car engine, and died in hospital on 14 August 1942. He was buried in Brisbane's Lutwyche Cemetery which, coincidentally, is located on the corner of Gympie and Kitchener Roads.\n\nIn 2009, an Australian lawyer and naval reservist, Commander Jim Unkles, submitted personal petitions, requesting a review of the convictions for Morant, Handcock and Witton, to The Crown, in the form of:\n\nThe petitions committee considered Unkles' petition on 15 March 2010. He appeared before it, along with others including historian Craig Wilcox. Committee member Alex Hawke MHR stated: \"there is in my view serious and compelling evidence that some form of redress should be given, all these years later, to those men executed by the British\". The then Attorney-General of Australia, Robert McLelland referred the petition to the UK government.\n\nOn behalf of the Crown, Unkles' petition was rejected by UK Defence Secretary Liam Fox, in November 2010.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3306721", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3306721", "title": "Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States", "text": "Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States\n\nThe Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), also referred to as the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States Annotated (HTSA), is the primary resource for determining tariff (customs duties) classifications for goods imported into the United States. It can also be used in place of Schedule B for classifying goods exported from the United States to foreign countries. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule classifies a good based on its name, use, and/or the material used in its construction and assigns it a ten-digit classification code number, and there are over 17,000 unique classification code numbers. Although the U.S. International Trade Commission publishes and maintains the Schedule in its various forms, U.S. Customs and Border Protection is the only agency that can provide legally binding advice or rulings on classification of imports.\n\nThe Schedule is based on the international Harmonized System, the global system of nomenclature that is used to describe most world trade in goods, maintained by the World Customs Organization (WCO). Virtually all countries base their tariff schedules on the WCO's Harmonized System.\n\nThe HTS was enacted by subtitle B of title I of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, and became effective on January 1, 1989, replacing the previous Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS). The United States had not adopted the previous international nomenclatures, but signed on as a member to the World Customs Organization, which created the Customs Cooperation Council (CCC) and the U.S. Customs Service—predecessor to U.S. Customs and Border Protection of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security). Such organizations helped develop the HTS throughout the 1970s.\n\nIn 1981, President Ronald Reagan requested that the U.S. International Trade Commission prepare a draft of the U.S. tariff schedules using HTS nomenclature. This conversion was issued in June 1983, and after lengthy review from interested parties, replaced the TSUS on August 23, 1988 with the enactment of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act.\n\nThe tariff schedule has 99 chapters under 22 sections, and various appendices for chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and intermediate chemicals for dye. Raw materials or basic substances generally appear in the early chapters and in earlier headings within a chapter, whereas highly processed goods and manufactured articles appear in later chapters and headings. For example, Section I and Section II cover animals and plants, while Sections XVI, XVII, and XVIII cover \"Machinery and Mechanical Applicances\", \"Vehicles, Aircraft, and Vessels\", and \"Precision Instruments, Clocks and Watches, and Musical Instruments\".\n\nThis is not a hard-and-fast rule, however; \"toys\" appear in Chapter 95 and \"works of art\" are found in Chapter 97. Chapter 77 is \"reserved for possible future use\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20615738", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20615738", "title": "Hutchins Commission", "text": "Hutchins Commission\n\nThe Hutchins Commission (whose official name was the Commission on Freedom of the Press) was formed during World War II, when Henry Luce (publisher of \"Time\" and \"Life\" magazines) asked Robert Hutchins (president of the University of Chicago) to recruit a commission to inquire into the proper function of the media in a modern democracy. The commission was established as a response to criticism from the public and government over media ownership.\n\nAs the Commission chair, Hutchins had the duty of selecting members for the Commission, but he ran his picks by Henry Luce first. The final commission was made up of twelve prominent intellectuals, all white upper-class men. Although all members were respected intellectuals with sterling reputations, none was a journalist. Hutchins thought the commission would be more open-minded if it contained no journalists, but enemies of the Commission, particularly in the press, used that to attack its credentials.\n\nAfter deliberating for four years, the Commission came to this conclusion in 1947: the press plays an important role in the development and stability of modern society and, as such, it is imperative that a commitment of social responsibility be imposed on mass media. According to this social responsibility theory, the press has a moral obligation to consider the overall needs of society when making journalistic decisions in order to produce the greatest good. Though there had been journalism \"codes of ethics\" for decades, the Commission's report was considered landmark by some scholars; they believed it was a pivotal reassertion of modern media's role in a democratic society.\n\nSocial-responsibility theory was born at a time (just after Franklin Roosevelt’s death) when large and powerful publishers were unpopular with the public, and when the public had a high degree of suspicions about the motivations and objectives of the press. The press had mushroomed into an unwieldy and powerful entity, and criticism of the Fourth Estate was widespread. Critics contended that the media had monopolistic tendencies, that corporate owners were not concerned with the rights or interests of those unlike themselves, and that commercialization produced a debased culture as well as dangerously selfish politics.\n\nSocial-responsibility theory thus proposes that the media take it upon themselves to elevate society's standards, providing citizens with the information they need to govern themselves. It is in the best interest of the media to do this; if they do not, social theorists warn, the public will demand that the government regulate the media.\n\nSome scholars (among them John C. Nerone) have speculated whether journalistic fairness and balance already existed prior to the Commission’s report. Were the Commission's conclusions merely an \"adjustment\" in liberalism, brought on by perceived business demands? Libertarians (who prioritize individual liberty and seek to minimize the power of the state) are wary of the social-responsibility theory; they believe that responsibility means accountability, accountability means government intervention, and government intervention comes at the expense of liberty. Indeed, the Commission noted that continued misuse of press power would necessitate regulation.\n\n\n"}

It is located at Loyola University Chicago School of Law in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nThe School of Law created the institute in 1994 at the direction of then-dean Nina S. Appel, Professor Jane H. Locke, and a variety of other supporters. Funding for the institute was provided via a cy pres award from the late United States District Judge Hubert Will with funds remaining from a large antitrust settlement. In 2009, the institute celebrated its 15th anniversary.\n\nBeginning in 2000, Professor Spencer Waller became director of the institute. Professor Waller has authored numerous scholarly articles and several books on the subject of antitrust. Prior to joining the institute, Professor Waller served as associate dean at Brooklyn Law School. In addition to teaching, Professor Waller practiced with the United States Department of Justice Antitrust and Criminal Divisions and with the Chicago law firm of Freeborn & Peters.\n\nShaping the Future of Competition and Consumer Law and Policy, an online brochure, lists the antitrust- and consumer protection-focused courses offered at Loyola University Chicago School of Law, detailed descriptions of the Student Fellow and Senior Research Fellow programs, and also chronicles the institute's involvement with the local and international competition communities.\n\nThe institute promotes the study and discussion of consumer and competition law issues through its Student Fellowship Program, which began in January 2001. Fellows are law students chosen from among applicants who meet certain minimum requirements, including academic achievement (fellows must be in the top one-third of their class), an interest in pursuing a career in antitrust or consumer protection, and complete requisite coursework.[3] The institute provides fellows with a stipend.\n\nFellows attend all institute events as well as special programs designed to inform them of current topics of interest in competition law, practice and policy. These special programs introduce the fellows to the key policymakers in the public and private sectors. Each year, the institute sends fellows to the ABA Section of Antitrust Spring Meeting. In addition, fellows engage in externships with organizations such as the Federal Trade Commission, the Illinois Attorney General, public interest groups and private law firms.\n\nThe fellows write papers on timely antitrust and consumer protection issues, recent Supreme Court decisions and new developments in these fields. To see a few of the more recent papers written by fellows, scholars and institute faculty members, please click here, or see below under News & Views.\n\nAlumni of the Student Fellowship Program work at a wide variety of law firms, government agencies and corporate counsel offices. The institute has alumni who followed career paths at the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Brooklyn Legal Services Foreclosure Defense.\n\nThe institute also sponsors a senior research fellow. Typically, the institute has one senior research fellow on staff at all times. Senior research fellows conduct research, write articles for publication, teach and engage in guest lecturing at the law school. In the past, Philipp Fabbio of the University of Reggio Calabria School of Law served as a senior research fellow. Professor Fabbio taught courses in EU Law and International and Comparative Antitrust.\n\nAdditionally, Marek Martyniszyn served as a senior research fellow. Dr. Martyniszyn joined the institute after having submitted his doctoral thesis, which was the result of his research conducted while he was the Ad Astra Research Scholar at the University College Dublin School of Law.\nFormer Illinois AG Neil Hartigan has joined Loyola's Institute for Consumer Antitrust Studies as a distinguished fellow in residence.\n\nLoyola's Institute for Consumer Antitrust Studies now offers online Master of Jurisprudence and Master of Laws degree programs in Global Competition Law, featuring a comprehensive curriculum, exceptional faculty and a flexible structure. For more information on each specific program, see below.\n\nOver 130 jurisdictions around the world enforce some form of competition law that prohibits cartels and other agreements to harm competition and consumers. Competition law also prevents monopolization or abuse of a dominant position, and anticompetitive mergers and acquisitions. The Institute for Consumer Antitrust Studies at Loyola University of Chicago has over 20 years of experience teaching, researching, publishing and advocating for a more competitive and consumer-friendly economy. Loyola's new online LLM and MJ programs offer professionals around the globe who are working in government, the private sector, or academia the opportunity to strengthen their skills and knowledge of competition law through flexible part-time online programs.\n\nTo see teaching faculty biographies, click here.\n\nTo read a student testimonial, click here.\n\nThe Master of Jurisprudence (MJ) in Global Competition Law is a degree program designed for non-lawyer competition and consumer professionals to provide a comprehensive working knowledge of the competition law field.

{"id": "260962", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=260962", "title": "Justice of the peace", "text": "Justice of the peace\n\nA justice of the peace (JP) is a judicial officer of a lower or \"puisne\" court, elected or appointed by means of a commission (letters patent) to keep the peace. In past centuries the term commissioner of the peace was often used with the same meaning. Depending on the jurisdiction, such justices dispense summary justice or merely deal with local administrative applications in common law jurisdictions. Justices of the peace are appointed or elected from the citizens of the jurisdiction in which they serve, and are (or were) usually not required to have any formal legal education in order to qualify for the office. Some jurisdictions have varying forms of training for JPs.\n\nIn 1195, Richard I (\"the Lionheart\") of England and his Minister Hubert Walter commissioned certain knights to preserve the peace in unruly areas. They were responsible to the King for ensuring that the law was upheld and preserving the \"King's peace\". Therefore, they were known as \"keepers of the peace\".\n\nAn act of 1327 had referred to \"good and lawful men\" to be appointed in every county in the land to \"guard the peace\"; such individuals were first referred to as conservators of the peace, or wardens of the peace. The title \"justice of the peace\" derives from 1361, in the reign of Edward III. The \"peace\" to be guarded is the sovereign's, the maintenance of which is the duty of the Crown under the royal prerogative. Justices of the peace still use the power conferred or re-conferred on them since 1361 to bind over unruly persons \"to be of good behaviour\". The bind over is not a punishment, but a preventive measure, intended to ensure that people thought likely to offend will not do so. The justices' alternative title of \"magistrate\" dates from the 16th century, although the word had been in use centuries earlier to describe some legal officials of Roman times.\n\nIn the centuries from the Tudor period until the onset of the Industrial Revolution, the JPs constituted a major element of the English (later British) governmental system, which had been termed sometimes squirearchy (i.e., dominance of the land-owning gentry). For example, historian Tim Blanning notes that while in Britain the royal prerogative was decisively curbed by the Bill of Rights 1689, in practice the central government in London had a greater ability to get its policies implemented in the rural outlying regions than could contemporary absolute monarchies such as France – a paradox due especially to JPs belonging to the same social class as the Members of Parliament and thus having a direct interest in getting laws actually enforced and implemented on the ground.\n\nBeing an unpaid office, undertaken voluntarily and sometimes more for the sake of renown or to confirm the justice's standing within the community, the justice was typically a member of the gentry. The justices of the peace conducted arraignments in all criminal cases, and tried misdemeanours and infractions of local ordinances and bylaws. Towns and boroughs with enough burdensome judicial business that could not find volunteers for the unpaid role of justice of the peace had to petition the Crown for authority to hire a paid stipendiary magistrate.\n\nThe Municipal Corporations Act 1835 stripped the power to appoint normal JPs from those municipal corporations that had it. This was replaced by the present system, where the Lord Chancellor nominates candidates with local advice, for appointment by the Crown.\n\nUntil the introduction of elected county councils in the 19th century, JPs, in quarter sessions, also administered the county at a local level. They fixed wages, regulated food supplies, built and controlled roads and bridges, and undertook to provide and supervise locally those services mandated by the Crown and Parliament for the welfare of the county.\n\nWomen were not allowed to become JPs in the United Kingdom until 1919, the first woman being Ada Summers, the Mayor of Stalybridge, who was a JP (\"Ex officio\") by virtue of her office. In October 1920 Ada was appointed a JP officially, alongside other pioneers like Miriam Lightowler OBE in Halifax. Emily Murphy of Edmonton, Canada, preceded her by some three and a half years. Now in the UK, 50% of JPs are women.\n\nIn special circumstances, a justice of the peace can be the highest governmental representative, so in fact 'gubernatorial', in a colonial entity. This was the case in the Tati Concessions Land, a gold-mining concession (territory) in the Matabele kingdom, until its annexation by the British Bechuanaland protectorate.\n\nA justice of the peace in Australia is typically someone of good stature in the community who is authorised to witness and sign statutory declarations and affidavits and to certify copies of original documents. Criteria for appointment vary widely, depending on the state.\n\nIn the state of Queensland, a \"justice of the peace (qualified)\" has the additional powers to issue search warrants and arrest warrants and, in conjunction with another justice of the peace (qualified) constitute a magistrates' court for exercising powers to remand defendants in custody, grant bail, and adjourn court hearings.\n\nSome justices are appointed as justice of the peace (magistrates' court), usually in remote aboriginal communities, to perform many of the functions that might otherwise fall to a stipendiary magistrate.\n\nIn Queensland, a lawyer may be appointed as a Justice of the Peace without further education or qualification and has the full powers of a JP (Magistrate's Court). A commissioner for declarations (C.dec) has powers limited to witnessing documents, witnessing statutory declarations, witnessing affidavits, witnessing and administering oaths and affirmations.\n\nThe first woman to become a JP in Queensland was Matilda (Maud) Hennessey of Mackay on 24 April 1918.\n\nJustices of the peace and bail justices, who are also volunteers, are appointed to serve a semi-judicial function in all areas of the Victorian community. The main official roles in the Victorian community include witnessing statutory declarations, witnessing affidavits and hearing bail matters outside court hours (bail justices only).\n\nThe first woman to become a JP in Victoria was Mary Catherine Rogers who, in 1920, became the first woman councillor in Australia when she was elected in the City of Richmond.\n\nJustices of the peace (JPs) provide a service to the community as independent witnesses of statutory declarations, powers of attorney and affidavits. JPs, who are also volunteers, are selected through an extensive interview, written exam and practical testing. They are recommended by the state attorney-general and appointed by the governor-in-council, and it is their job to authorise and witness statutory declarations and affidavits within the state of Victoria. There are currently around 4,800 JPs serving in all areas of the state.\n\nThe role of a bail justice is to hear bail applications (under the Bail Act 1977) and to hear applications for interim accommodation orders for children (under the Children and Young Persons Act 1989) within Victoria. Bail justices, once appointed, may remain in their role until they turn 70 years of age (although they must be under 65 at the time of their appointment). They are often required to attend call outs and rule on bail applications or protection applications for children in danger on weekends and late at night when the courts are closed, but they can also witness Victorian statutory declarations and affidavits. Candidates must successfully complete a three-day training course run by the Department of Justice. Bail justices, who are also volunteers, also have some limited powers under federal legislation, including the power to conduct interstate extradition hearings and extending question time for federal police. Bail Justices may use the post-nominals BJ after their names.\n\nThe most common functions performed by a justice of the peace in New South Wales are to witness the signing of a statutory declaration, witness the signing of an affidavit and certify that a copy of an original document is a true copy.\n\nJPs are appointed by the Governor of New South Wales for five-year terms. They are volunteers, who come from all walks of life and all sections of the community. JPs are people who are trusted to be honest, careful and impartial when performing the functions of a JP. They must not charge a fee or accept a gift for providing JP services, tell people what to write in a statutory declaration or affidavit or write it for them or give them legal advice.\n\nWays to find a JP in New South Wales include:\n1. Search the JP Public Register. The register lists all JPs for each postcode area and provides a telephone contact number for JPs who serve the community directly. \n2. Check a public listing of scheduled JP services to find when JPs are available at scheduled times and locations across the state.\n\nIn South Australia, there are two types of justices: justice of the peace and special justices.\n\nA justice of the peace (JP) in South Australia is typically someone of good stature in the community who is authorised to witness and sign statutory declarations, affidavits, waiver rights, search warrants, drug warrants, divorce documents, and to certify copies of original documents and to witness the signing of power of attorney and guardianship documents, providing the JP is satisfied with the capability of the signatory.\n\nA Special Justice (SJ) is a higher level of justice of the peace in South Australia; they sit on the bench of the magistrates' court hearing cases in the petty sessions division.\n\nThe South Australian Attorney-General has set up a web site to locate justices of the peace. The majority of metropolitan and many regional Councils (Local Government authorities) have a rotational justice of the peace in residence at nominated times.\n\nSouth Australia's first women justices were appointed in July 1915.\n\nJustices of the peace in Western Australia are appointed by the Governor who authorises them to carry out a wide range of official administrative and judicial duties in the community.\n\nAs well as presiding in the Magistrates Court, justices of the peace are regularly called upon by the WA Police to sign search warrants and authorise the issuing of summonses. The administrative tasks include witnessing affidavits and documents such as wills and statutory declarations.\n\n'Visiting justices' are a special group of justices of the peace, appointed to preside over cases within the prison system.\n\nIn Belgium, the justice of the peace (, ) is a law-trained judge who sits the lowest Court of record with original jurisdiction over small claims (less than €2500) matters of civil, commercial, and family law, including: tenancy and lease disputes, neighborhood disputes (party structures, trespassing, noise pollution), apartment buildings, small deceased estates, alimony, guardianships & adoption, and the commitment of mental patients and oversight of their care. Litigants may opt either for conciliation or trial. Lawyers may act as \"locum tenens\" JPs.\n\nIn Canada, justices of the peace play a role in the administration of justice at the provincial level. Justices are generally appointed by the lieutenant governors of Canada's provinces, and by the commissioners of Canada's territories, on the advice of their relevant premier or Attorney General. Canada made the first appointment in the then British Empire of a woman as a magistrate, namely Emily Murphy, who was sworn in as a police magistrate in the Women's Court of the City of Edmonton (Alberta) on 19 June 1916.\n\nIn British Columbia, pursuant to the \"Provincial Court Act\", all judges are justices of the peace, and hence all of them are peace officers.\n\nIn the Northwest Territories, justices may hear summary conviction matters, municipal by-laws, and certain criminal matters. However, in more populated provinces justices usually preside over bail hearings and provincial offences courts. When not in a court session, a justice can perform other judicial functions, such as issuing search warrants.\n\nIn Ontario, justices perform a wide variety of duties related to criminal and regulatory law, at the federal, provincial and municipal levels. Ontario JP wear a green sash versus red worn by judges.\n\nIn Quebec, there are two type of justices of the peace, administrative justice of the peace and presiding justice of the peace.\n\nAdministrative justice of the peace are court officers appointed by the Minister of Justice, and perform duties such as receiving criminal informations and issuing warrants. Presiding justice of the peace are appointed by commission under the Great Seal, and can try some criminal matters and issue warrants. They are appointed from advocates of at least ten years' standing and serve full-time until the age of 70.\n\nIn Yukon, justices of the peace are lay officers of the court. They sit in the Justice of the Peace Court, which is part of the Territorial Court of Yukon.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the historical functions of justices of the peace have been replaced by full-time, legally qualified magistrates. Nowadays, justices of the peace are essentially titles of honour given by the Government to community leaders, and to certain officials while they are in their terms of offices. They have no judicial functions, and their main duties include visiting prisons, institutions for young offenders and drug addicts, psychiatric hospitals, remand homes, places of refuge, reception and detention centres, administering statutory declarations, and serving as members of advisory panels.\n\nIn India, justices of the peace do exist, but they no longer occupy a prominent post. One of the famous justices in India was Kavasji Jamshedji Petigara.\n\nMaharaja Prabirendra Mohan Tagore son of Maharaja Sir Prodyut Kumar Tagore KCSI of Calcutta was designated Justice of the Peace in 1932. He played a great part in saving more than 200 Muslim lives during the infamous riots in 1947 during the partition of India, by sheltering the Muslims in the Calcutta locality and most importantly in his palace itself.\n\nJustices of the peace existed in Ireland prior to 1922, sitting in a bench under the supervision of resident magistrates at petty sessions to try minor offences summarily, and with a county court judge (in his capacity of chairman of quarter sessions) and jury to try more serious offences at quarter sessions. In the Irish Free State the position was effectively abolished by the District Justices (Temporary Provisions) Act 1923 and permanently abolished by the Courts of Justice Act 1924. Their judicial powers were replaced by full-time, legally qualified district justices (now called district judges) and their quasi-judicial powers by lay Peace Commissioners. Peace commissioners may sign statutory declarations, and may issue summons and search warrants to the Garda Síochána (Irish police). A Peace Commissioner cannot sign an Affidavit, in Ireland that function is performed by a Commissioner for Oaths.\n\nA justice of the peace (JP), according to the Ministry of Justice, is a person of unquestionable integrity who seeks to promote and protect the rights of the individual and helps to provide justice to persons in a particular community. Additionally, the JP serves as a justice in petty court sessions, attends juvenile court sessions, issues summonses, considers applications for bail, explains and signs legal documents, sits on licensing panels, and gives counsel/advice. Any Jamaican citizen that can speak and write English is eligible to become a JP. Any club/organisation/citizen can recommend someone to become JP for a community. JPs are chosen under the Governor-General's discretion.\n\nIn Malaysia, justices of the peace have largely been replaced in magistrates' courts by legally qualified (first-class) stipendiary magistrates. However, state governments continue to appoint justices of the peace as honours. In 2004, some associations of justices of the peace pressed the federal government to allow justices of the peace to sit as second-class magistrates in order to reduce the backlog of cases in the courts.\n\nA Justice of the Peace in New Zealand is someone of good stature in the community who is authorized to witness and sign statutory declarations and affidavits as well as certify documents. They may also perform citizenship ceremonies and act as a Visiting Justice in prisons the function of which is to record a prisoner's grievance and decide on its validity.\n\nThey have certain powers to issue search warrants, and (in conjunction with another justice of the peace) may try minor criminal trials in the district court and exercise powers to remand defendants in custody, grant bail, and adjourn court hearings. They are nominated for office by local Members of Parliament and appointed by the Governor General. Appointment is for life and a JP must take the Oath of Allegiance and the Judicial Oath.\n\nSections 22, 22-A and 22-B of the Code of Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 provide for the appointment of justices of the peace by the provincial governments, their powers and duties respectively. However, seldom are justices of the peace appointed in Pakistan outside the judiciary. Session and additional session judges act as ex-officio justices of the peace as per Section 25 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. An Ex-officio Justice of the Peace may issue appropriate directions to the police authorities concerned on a complaint regarding-\n(i) non-registration of a criminal case;\n(ii) transfer of investigation from one police officer to another; and\n(iii) neglect, failure or excess committed by a police authority in relation to its functions and duties.\nSuch functions being quasi-judicial in nature could not be termed as executive, administrative or ministerial.(PLD 2016 Supreme Court 581)\n\nIt is pertinent to note however, as many academics have pointed out, that there is great utility in the appointment of such justices especially in rural areas where enmity between rival groups can lead to the inability of registration of cognizable offences and biased judicial proceedings.\n\nA justice of the peace in Singapore derives his powers from statute law. He is appointed by the President of the Republic of Singapore, under the provisions of section 11(l) of the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap.321). The President may revoke the appointment of any justice of the peace. A newly appointed justice of the peace is required by section 17 of the Subordinate Courts Act, to take the oath of office and allegiance as set out in the schedule to the Subordinate Courts Act, before exercising the functions of his office.\n\nIn their role, JPs serve as visiting justices of Singapore prisons, mediators or referees in the subordinate courts. They may also solemnise marriages in the Registry of Marriages or perform the duties of the magistrate conferred on them by any written law.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, Justice of the Peace (JP) is an honorary post, with authorization to witness and sign statutory declarations and affidavits as well as certify documents. Persons appointed as a Justice of the Peace may use the post-nominal JP. Current appointments are made under the \"Judicature Act No 02 of 1978\", by the Minister of Justice at his/her discretion by publishing a list in the Gazette and appointee taking oaths before a high court, district court judge or magistrate with registrar of the supreme court recording it. There are four types of appointments of Justice of the Peace;\n\nSenior Attorney at laws are appointed as Justice of the Peace and Unofficial magistrates to preside in the absence of a sitting Magistrate.. Any citizen of Sri Lanka can apply to the Ministry of Justice giving his or her credentials to be appointed as a justice of the peace. However, the applicant should be one who has served the public and carries out social service and should be of good standing. These JPs would be appointed with legal authority in all parts of the island or limited to a judicial district. The President of Sri Lanka and his/her officers are \"ex officio\" justices of the peace. There about 100,000 JPs in the island. \n\nThe post was introduced in the island during the British colonial era by the Governor Frederick North in 1801 and was later reformed in 1871. Until 1938, appointments were made by the Governor, after which appointments were made by the Legal Secretary until 1947. After Ceylon gained its independence in 1948, appointments were made by the Governor General and the Minister of Justice. Justice of the Peace had the power to administer oaths and affirmations per the \"Courts Ordinance No. 1 on 1889 section 84\" and they could formally appoint members of the public to act as special police officers in times of turmoil and riots. Since certain government officers were ex-officio justices of the peace, this allowed British colonial officers to appoint special police officers from the European planters in times of crisies such as the 1915 riots. The Village Councils Law (No. 6 of 1964) made the Chairman of the Village Council an \"ex officio\" justices of the peace for that village area.\n\nIn 2014, for the first time, Justices of the Peace were authorized in Tonga. JPs are appointed by the Crown, but the Lord Chief Justice regulates their duties and defines their powers. The first JPs were warranted with duties including granting bail; issuing search warrants and subpoenas; taking affidavits, declarations and oaths; and having the power to witness documents. Term of office is one year and officials can be reappointed. The initial 19 JPs appointed were: ‘Aisea Ta’ofi and Sione Hinakau of Niuatoputapu; ‘Inoke Tuaimei’api of Niuafo'ou; Siosiua Hausia from ʻEua; Sione Palu, Sione Fakahua, Me’ite Fukofuka and Kisione Taulani of Ha’apai; Salesi Kauvaka, Viliami Pasikala, Haniteli Fa’anunu, Meli Taufaeteau and Moleni Taufa from Vava’u; and Salote Fukofuka, ‘Amelia Helu, ‘Ofa Likiliki, Tevita Fakatou, Sioape Tu’iono and Semisi Tongia of Tongatapu.\n\nA magistrates' court in England and Wales is composed of a bench of (usually three) JPs or magistrates, who dispense summary justice: that is they decide on offences which carry up to six months in prison, to a maximum of one year of imprisonment over not less than two indictable offences, or an unlimited fine. They are advised on points of law and procedure by a legally qualified justices' clerk and their assistants. No formal qualifications are required but magistrates need intelligence, common sense, integrity and the capacity to act fairly. Membership is widely spread throughout the local area and drawn from all walks of life following a rigorous selection process. All magistrates are carefully trained before sitting and continue to receive training throughout their service. Magistrates are unpaid volunteers but they may receive allowances to cover travelling expenses and subsistence. Lay justices or magistrates must sit for a minimum of 26 sessions (half-days) per year, but some sit as much as a day a week, or possibly more. Magistrates can sit alone to hear issues such as warrant applications or many traffic offences under the new Single Justice Procedure.\n\nIn addition to the lay justices, there are a small number of district judges, formerly known as \"stipendiary magistrates\". These are legally qualified, full-time members of the magistracy and hear cases alone, without any other magistrates on the bench. It is important to distinguish the district judge (magistrates' court) from the district judges who usually sit in the county court.\n\nMagistrates' courts today can deal with minor offences (fines of up to £5,000, or imprisonment of up to six months for a single offence or 12 months for consecutive sentences, or both) and handle over 95% of the criminal cases in England and Wales and Northern Ireland. With more serious offences, magistrates are responsible for indictment and committal to the Crown Court (a task in former times dealt with by a grand jury). Magistrates also have a civil jurisdiction, such as a family jurisdiction. Although they had a licensing jurisdiction dealing liquor, betting and clubs licensing applications, this was transferred under the Licensing Act 2003 to local authorities. The magistrates now act in licensing matters only as an appeal court from the decisions of the local authority.\n\nCardiff Magistrates' Court is the only court in the country which deals with offences under the Companies Act, such as for late filing of accounts or directors' offences. Westminster Magistrates' Court has special responsibilities for dealing with all terrorism and extradition offences throughout the UK.\n\nUntil the Courts Act 2003 came into force, magistrates were tied to a particular area (see magistrates' courts committee, commission area, petty sessions area). This has now been changed such that they are assigned to local justice areas, but less strongly.\n\nThe Courts Act provides the current framework for appointment of the justices, which is done by the Lord Chancellor in the name of sovereign. Justices can also be removed by the same mechanism. District judges (magistrates' court) – previously known as stipendiary magistrates – must have a seven years' general legal qualification, and are appointed by the sovereign on the advice of the Lord Chancellor.\n\nBefore 1714, magistrates were liable to be approached at any time and in any place by people legally recognised as paupers, appealing for aid if parish authorities refused to provide any. It was relatively common for these magistrates to write out, on the spot, an order requiring aid to be granted.\n\nWithin the Scottish legal system justices of the peace are lay magistrates who currently sit in the justice of the peace courts. These courts were introduced in 2009 as a replacement for the district courts (established in 1975), which in turn replaced burgh police courts. Justices sit alone or in threes with a qualified legal assessor as convener or clerk of court. They handle many cases of breaches of the peace — drunkenness, minor assaults, petty theft, and offences under the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982.\n\nThe maximum sentencing power of a justice of the peace is 60 days imprisonment, or a fine up to £2,500, or both, and the ability to disqualify drivers.\n\nIn 2006, the Scottish Government announced its intention to unify the management of the sheriff and district courts in Scotland but retain lay justices, as part of its initiative to create a unified judiciary under the Lord President. Following the passage of the Criminal Proceedings etc. (Reform) (Scotland) Act 2007 the justice of the peace courts were implemented on a sheriffdom-by-sheriffdom basis.\n\nIn Glasgow, the volume of business required the employment of three solicitors as \"stipendiary magistrates\" who sat in place of the lay justices. The stipendiary magistrates' court had the same sentencing power as the summary sheriff court in summary proceedings, which was the ability to sentence an offender to up to one year in prison or fine them up to . Stipendiary magistrates were replaced by summary sheriffs.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, the situation initially continued as it had in pre-1922 Ireland. However, justices of the peace no longer sat out of petty sessions after 1935 (Summary Jurisdiction and Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1935). Since then, magistrates' courts in Northern Ireland have consisted of legally qualified resident magistrates (now known as district judges (magistrates' courts)) sitting alone, except in cases involving children, where two lay panelists sat with the magistrate. Justices of the peace were confined to the power to conduct committal hearings, bind persons over to the peace, sign warrants, summons, and other official documents. They were appointed by the Lord Chancellor on the recommendation of a committee in each county court division.\n\nThe Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002 introduced a new office of lay magistrate, to sit alongside resident magistrates at magistrates' courts in certain matters. Unlike in England and Wales, \"lay magistrate\" is the official title of the position, to distinguish from existing justices of the peace who do not sit in the magistrates' courts. The first lay magistrates were appointed in 2005. Two lay magistrates sit with the district judge (magistrates' court) in criminal proceedings involving children (replacing the former lay panelists) and Family Proceedings Court matters. The district judge (magistrates' court), who is a barrister or solicitor of at least seven years standing, presides over the bench. Most criminal justice functions of JPs were transferred to lay magistrates. It is expected that there will be no further appointments of justices of the peace in Northern Ireland, although those already appointed retain the title and any functions not transferred to lay magistrate under the 2002 Act.\n\nIn some US states, the justice of the peace is a judge of a court of limited jurisdiction, a magistrate, or a quasi-judicial official with certain statutory or common law magisterial powers. Some states have special qualifications or unique features for the office.\n\nThe justice of the peace typically presides over a court that hears misdemeanor cases, traffic violations, and other petty criminal infractions. The justice of the peace may also have authority over cases involving small debts, landlord and tenant disputes, or other small claims court proceedings. Proceedings before justices of the peace are often faster and less formal than the proceedings in other courts. In some jurisdictions a party convicted or found liable before a justice of the peace may have the right to a trial de novo before the judge of a higher court rather than an appeal strictly considered.\n\nA justice of the peace also performs civil marriages.\n\nA justice of the peace has the same jurisdiction as a municipal magistrate with respect to traffic and misdemeanor cases and restraining orders, though over cases whose affairs are not contained within the confines of a single municipality. Additionally, the Justice Court hears cases involving county ordinances (ordinances enacted by the board of supervisors that apply only to unincorporated areas), civil lawsuits up to a limit of $10,000, small claims cases up to $2,500, and issues evictions, called writs of restitution (after a forcible detainer or special detainer action (eviction) being successfully completed by a landlord). Justices of the peace, also called JPs, or Judges of the Justice Court, are elected in partisan elections for four-year terms from specific districts called precincts. They have the same authority and responsibility as all other judges in the state with respect to performing marriages, administrating oaths, adhering to the code of judicial conduct, and all aspects of justice administration. However, Arizona law does not require justices of the peace to be lawyers. Many justices of the peace are not legally trained, although all are required by the Arizona Supreme Court to complete a course at the Arizona Judicial College. As with JPs, municipal judges in Arizona are not required to be lawyers.\n\nIn Arkansas, a justice of the peace is an elected official equivalent to a county commissioner or county supervisor in some other states. Arkansas JPs sit on a county quorum court, composed of 9, 11, 13 or 15 JPs. The quorum court is a part-time body, elected from single-member districts, that has overall responsibility for county affairs. Among their responsibilities are passing the budget, creating new ordinances (at the misdemeanor level), setting property tax millage levels, and working with other elected officials. The full-time elected county administrator, who presides over the quorum court, is the county judge. Neither JPs nor the county judge have any judicial authority, though they do have the power to preside over civil marriages. Justices of the peace are elected every two years to these partisan offices.\n\nJustices of the peace in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts are often called on to perform marriages and, especially same-sex marriages, which certain religious officials are not willing to oversee. Justices of the peace in Connecticut can preside over same-sex marriages. Unlike Massachusetts, Connecticut JPs are not penalized for refusing to perform such ceremonies.\n\nJustices of the peace in Connecticut and Massachusetts have the same general oath-giving powers as a notary public. \n\n\nIn Minnesota, the office of the Justice of the Peace was abolished in 1977 (Minn. Stat. 487.35). It has not existed for 40-plus years although some people who offer private wedding officiant services erroneously claim to be Justices of the Peace, this term may not properly be used inasmuch as the office has been abolished. Under Minnesota law, however, judges, retired judges, court administrators, retired court administrators,and other public officials designated in statute may officiate or solemnize marriage ceremonies in addition to licensed or ordained ministers of any religious denomination who have filed their credentials with a county registrar (Minn, Stat. 517.04).\n\nJustice courts are courts in New York State that handle traffic tickets, criminal matters, small claims and local code violations such as zoning. Though justice courts constitutionally are part of the New York State Unified Court System, state law generally makes justice courts independent of New York's Office of Court Administration (OCA) and instead makes Justice Courts the responsibility of their sponsoring localities. Town justice courts are often called Town Court, and village justice courts are often called Village Court. City courts in New York State handle mostly the same types of cases but are not justice courts.\n\nThe official title for judges in Justice Courts is Justice, the same as in New York Supreme Court. However, in common usage, most people, including lawyers, call them Judge. Justices in Justice Court do not have to be lawyers. The vast majority are not. Many of these courts are in small towns and villages where none of the residents are lawyers. In the larger towns, the justices are almost always lawyers.\n\nWhile Justices and their court clerks receive training from OCA, there is tremendous variability in how cases are handled. This includes court procedures and substantive results. Some courts will dismiss a traffic ticket if the officer does not appear for a trial, while others will adjourn the matter to give the officer another chance. In some courts the police prosecute their own tickets, while in others an Assistant District Attorney from the county or a town or village attorney will prosecute the tickets. This may even vary by the type of officer, with State Troopers and Deputies prosecuting their tickets and a town attorney prosecuting tickets written by the town police.\n\nLarger towns can have very busy caseloads, including several sessions a week with dozens of cases at each session, and people may have to wait hours before their cases are heard. In some small towns the caseload is extremely light, and a court might meet once a month and have only a few cases.\n\nAll criminal prosecutions that occur in towns and villages are commenced in a justice court. Misdemeanors are handled exclusively in the justice court, while felonies generally move up to County Court before the case moves forward.\n\nSimilar matters in some places outside New York are handled by a justice of the peace.\n\nTown and village Justices also possess limited powers of a New York notary public, ex-officio, only within the county in which the town or village for which they serve is located; they may administer oaths and affirmations and take acknowledgments and proofs of execution. Some Justices seek and obtain a formal New York notary public commission to permit free travel statewide and enjoy the additional privileges and international legal recognition of a notary public.\n\nNew Hampshire justices of the peace are commissioned magisterial officers, appointed by the Governor and Executive Council to terms of five years, with the power to administer oaths, acknowledge instruments, perform marriage ceremonies and, effective 1 January 2008, solemnize civil unions for same-sex couples. They may also order compulsory mental examinations for good cause, act as a magisterial official regarding enforcement complaints on orders for isolation or quarantine issued by the Commissioner of Health and Human Services, administer oaths of office to public officials, take depositions and issue subpoenas. New Hampshire justices of the peace are also authorized, upon a showing of probable cause supported by affidavit, to issue arrest warrants, search warrants, administrative inspection warrants and by court appointment, to fix and receive bail in criminal cases.\n\nIn Texas, JP's are elected on a partisan ballot every four years.\n\nTexas does not require a JP to be an attorney in good standing. However, JP's are required to be \"well versed in the law\" and take mandatory classes to retain their office. New JP's are required to take 80 hours of legal state mandated classes the first year, and 20 hours each year thereafter during their tenure in office.\n\nSections 18 and 19 of Article V of the Texas Constitution, as well as Chapters 27 and 28 of the Texas Government Code, outline the duties of these Courts and their officers.\n\nUnder Section 18, the number of JP's (and associated constables) is dependent on the size of the county:\n\nSection 19 sets forth the minimum jurisdiction of the JP court:\n\nJP cases are appealed to the county court level; the appeal results in a trial de novo. In criminal cases, cases beginning in justice court cannot be appealed beyond the county level court unless the fine is more than $100 or a constitutional matter is asserted.\n\nIn smaller counties without a coroner, the JP has the duty to perform inquests. The JP is also called out for any unattended deaths in the county.\n\nA JP in a large precinct in a large county will work 5 days a week, 8 or more hours daily. Their duties will include, but are not necessarily limited to the following: Trials of civil matters, both to a 6-person jury and to the bench, with an amount in controversy not exceeding $10,000.00. Trials of criminal matters involving traffic violations and class C misdemeanors punishable by fine only. Pre-trial motion dockets and show cause hearings are held, and all discovery must be approved by the Judge in advance in civil cases. All criminal matters are controlled by the rules of criminal procedure and evidence. A much more restricted and smaller set of rules apply in civil matters unless in the Judges discretion, it is believed to be in the best interests of justice to apply the standard rules of evidence and procedure. The court has the exclusive jurisdiction of evictions. A Texas JP Judge will also magistrate prisoners and set bail. The Judge will hear juvenile violations such as truancy, and underage drinking and smoking. Warrants of Arrest, Alias, Search and Capias Profine are issued. Protective Orders can issue and result in jail time if violated. Several administrative matters are heard including the finding of a Dangerous Dog, Occupational Drivers License and tow hearings. Many writs are issued such as writs of re-entry to apartments, possession of realty and to reinstate utilities a landlord may have turned off. A JP has contempt power of $100 and up to 3 days in jail per occurrence. A JP is also authorized to perform marriage ceremonies.\n\nJustices in Vermont are elected officials. They are elected by their towns but they are technically county officers. They also serve as election and poll officials, and on the boards of civil authority and tax abatement. They can perform civil marriages, administer oaths and have all the powers of a notary public.\n\nIn many states, the office of justice of the peace has been abolished or transferred to another court, such as the magistrate court. In larger cities, cases may be heard in a municipal court which has jurisdiction only within that city. Most efforts to abolish the office of justice of the peace have been led by the American Bar Association, which views non-lawyer judges as no longer necessary, as there are now far more persons with formal legal education than in the past when justices of the peace were first used.\n\nCalifornia formerly had justice of the peace courts staffed by lay judges, but began phasing them out after a landmark 1974 decision in which the Supreme Court of California unanimously held that it was a violation of federal due process (under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution) to allow a non-lawyer to preside over a criminal trial which could result in incarceration of the defendant. The court specifically recognized that in the aftermath of \"Gideon v. Wainwright\" (1963), it made no sense to allow a case to be tried before a layperson incapable of understanding the legal arguments of the attorney to whom the defendant was entitled under \"Gideon\". The remaining justice courts (as well as municipal courts) were eliminated by the passage of Proposition 220 in June 1998, which merged all lower courts within the state judicial branch into the superior courts (the courts of general jurisdiction). Under current California law, all California judges must be licensed attorneys.\n\nNotably, the Supreme Court of the United States sharply disagreed with California's analysis of the Fourteenth Amendment in the landmark case of \"North v. Russell\", , in which the court held that Kentucky's use of nonlawyer judges in its police courts was \"not\" a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees of due process and equal protection of the laws.\n\n"}
{"id": "30076555", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30076555", "title": "Korean Armistice Agreement", "text": "Korean Armistice Agreement\n\nThe Korean Armistice Agreement () is the armistice which brought about a complete cessation of hostilities of the Korean War. It was signed by U.S. Army Lieutenant General William Harrison, Jr. representing the United Nations Command (UNC), North Korean General Nam Il representing the Korean People's Army (KPA), and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA). The Armistice was signed on 27 July 1953, and was designed to \"ensure a complete cessation of hostilities and of all acts of armed force in Korea until a final peaceful settlement is achieved.\"\n\nDuring the 1954 Geneva Conference in Switzerland, Chinese Premier and foreign minister Zhou Enlai suggested that a peace treaty should be implemented on the Korean peninsula. However, the US secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, did not accommodate this attempt to achieve such a treaty. A final peace settlement has never been achieved. The signed Armistice established the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), the de facto new border between the two nations, put into force a cease-fire, and finalized repatriation of prisoners of war. The DMZ runs close to the 38th parallel and has separated North and South Korea since the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed in 1953.\n\nBy mid-December 1950, the United States was discussing terms for an agreement to end the Korean War. The desired agreement would end the fighting, provide assurances against its resumption, and protect the future security of UNC forces. The United States asked for a military armistice commission of mixed membership that would supervise all agreements. Both sides would need to agree to \"cease the introduction into Korea of any reinforcing air, ground or naval units or personnel... and to refrain from increasing the level of war equipment and material existing in Korea.\" The U.S. wished to create a demilitarized zone that would be roughly . The proposed agreement would also address the issue of prisoners of war which the U.S. believed should be exchanged on a one-for-one basis.\n\nWhile talk of a possible armistice agreement was circulating, in late May and early June 1951, the President of the Republic of Korea (ROK, South Korea) Syngman Rhee opposed peace talks. He believed the ROK should continue to expand its army in order to march all the way to the Yalu River and completely unify the nation. The UNC did not endorse Rhee's position. Even without UNC support, Rhee and the South Korean government attempted to mobilize the public to resist any halt in the fighting short of the Yalu River. Other ROK officials supported Rhee's ambitions and the National Assembly of South Korea unanimously passed a resolution endorsing a continued fight for an \"independent and unified country.\" At the end of June, however, the Assembly decided to support armistice talks, although President Rhee continued to oppose them.\n\nLike Syngman Rhee, North Korean leader Kim Il-sung also sought complete unification. The North Korean side was slow to support armistice talks and only on 27 June 1951seventeen days after armistice talks had begundid it change its slogan of \"drive the enemy into the sea\" to \"drive the enemy to the 38th parallel.\" North Korea was pressured to support armistice talks by its allies the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, whose support was vital to enabling North Korea to continue fighting.\n\nTalks concerning an armistice started 10 July 1951, in Kaesŏng, a North Korean city in North Hwanghae Province near the South Korean border. The two primary negotiators were Chief of Army Staff General Nam Il, a North Korean deputy premier, and United States Vice Admiral Charles Turner Joy. After a period of two weeks, on 26 June 1951, a five-part agenda was agreed upon and this guided talks until the signing of the armistice on 27 July 1953. The items to be discussed were:\n\n\nAfter the agenda was decided, talks proceeded slowly. There were lengthy intervals between meetings. The longest gap between discussions started on 23 August 1951, when North Korea and its allies claimed that the conference site in Kaesŏng had been bombed. North Korea requested the UNC conduct an immediate investigation, which concluded there was evidence a UNC aircraft had attacked the conference site. The evidence, however, appeared to be manufactured. The Communists subsequently refused to permit an investigation during daylight hours. Armistice talks did not start again until 25 October 1951. The U.S. would not allow further discussion to take place in Kaesŏng. Panmunjom, a nearby village in Kyŏnggi Province, close to both North and South Korea, was chosen as the new location for deliberations. This was conditional on responsibility for protection of the village being shared by both powers.\n\nA major, problematic negotiation point was prisoner of war (POW) repatriation. The Communists held 10,000 POWs and the UNC held 150,000 POWs. The PVA, KPA, and UNC could not agree on a system of repatriation because many PVA and KPA soldiers refused to be repatriated back to the north, which was unacceptable to the Chinese and North Koreans. In the final armistice agreement, signed on 27 July 1953, a Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, chaired by Indian general K. S. Thimayya, was set up to handle the matter.\n\nIn 1952 the United States elected a new president, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and on 29 November 1952 the president-elect went to Korea to investigate what might end the Korean War. With the United Nations' acceptance of India's proposed Korean War armistice, the KPA, the PVA, and the UNC ceased fire with the battle line approximately at the 38th Parallel. Upon agreeing to the armistice, the belligerents established the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which has since been patrolled by KPA, ROKA, United States, and Joint UNC forces. Discussions continued slowly because of difficulties regarding demarcation of the border between North and South Korea. China and North Korea expected the line to remain at the 38th Parallel. Within weeks, however, both nations accepted the Kansas Line, where the two sides had confronted each other at the time. In March 1953 the death of Joseph Stalin helped spur negotiations. While Chinese leader Mao Zedong was not willing to compromise then, the new Soviet leadership issued a statement two weeks after Stalin's death, calling for a quick end to hostilities.\nOn 19 July 1953 delegates reached agreement covering all issues on the agenda. On 27 July 1953 at 10:00 a.m. the Armistice was signed by Nam Il, delegate of the KPA and PVA, and William K. Harrison Jr., UNC delegate. Twelve hours after the signing of the document, all regulations approved in the armistice commenced. The agreement provided for monitoring by an international commission. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC) was established to prevent reinforcements being brought into Korea, either additional military personnel or new weapons, and NNSC member inspection teams from Czechoslovakia, Poland, Sweden and Switzerland operated throughout Korea.\n\nThe signed Armistice established a \"complete cessation of all hostilities in Korea by all armed force\" that was to be enforced by the commanders of both sides. The armistice is however only a cease-fire between military forces, rather than an agreement between governments. No peace treaty was signed which means that the Korean War has not officially ended. The armistice established the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) and the DMZ. The DMZ was agreed as a fortified buffer zone between the two Korean nations. The DMZ follows the Kansas Line where the two sides actually confronted each other at the time of the signing of the Armistice. The DMZ is currently the most heavily defended national border in the world .\n\nThe Armistice also established regulations regarding prisoners of war. The agreement stated that:\n\nUltimately, more than 22,000 KPA or PVA soldiers refused repatriation. On the opposite side, 327 South Korean soldiers, 21 American soldiers and 1 British soldier also refused repatriation, and remained in North Korea or in China. (See: List of American and British defectors in the Korean War.)\n\nWith the signing of the Armistice, the war is considered to have ended, even though there was no official peace treaty. Despite the three-year war, the international border remained at a similar location as at its start.\n\nArticle IV (Paragraph 60) of the Armistice Agreement calls for a political conference to be held within 3 months of the signing of the agreement in order \"to ensure the peaceful settlement of the Korean question\". A conference was held in Geneva, Switzerland in April 1954, missing the 3 month timeline by 6 months. The conference focused on two separate conflicts: the conflict in Korea; and the conflict in Indochina. Participants in the talks on the conflict in Korea were the US, the USSR, France, China, and North and South Korea. The peace agreement on the Korean peninsula was officially raised at the conference, by Chinese diplomat Zhou Enlai with the US Secretary of Defense, John Foster Dulles, but no progress was made. The United States intentionally avoided discussing the \"Peace Treaty on the Korean Peninsula\", in spite of criticism from the other representatives at the conference about the negative attitude of the United States.\n\nParagraph 13(d) of the Armistice Agreement mandated that neither side introduce new weapons into Korea, other than piece-for-piece replacement of equipment. In September 1956 the U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Radford indicated that the U.S. military intention was to introduce atomic weapons into Korea, which was agreed to by the U.S. National Security Council and President Eisenhower. The U.S. unilaterally abrogated paragraph 13(d), breaking the Armistice Agreement, despite concerns by United Nations allies. At a meeting of the Military Armistice Commission on 21 June 1957, the U.S. informed the North Korean representatives that the United Nations Command no longer considered itself bound by paragraph 13(d) of the armistice. In January 1958 nuclear armed Honest John missiles and 280mm atomic cannons were deployed to South Korea, followed within a year by atomic demolition munitions and nuclear armed Matador cruise missiles with the range to reach China and the Soviet Union. North Korea believed the U.S. had introduced new weapons earlier, citing NNSC inspection team reports for August 1953 to April 1954. The U.S. believed that North Korea had introduced new weapons contrary to 13(d), but did not make specific allegations.\n\nFollowing the abrogation of paragraph 13(d), the NNSC largely lost its function, and became primarily office based in the DMZ with a small staff. North Korea denounced the abrogation of paragraph 13(d). North Korea responded militarily by digging massive underground fortifications resistant to nuclear attack, and by the forward deployment of its conventional forces so that the use of nuclear weapons against it would endanger South Korean and U.S. forces as well. In 1963 North Korea asked the Soviet Union and China for help in developing nuclear weapons, but was refused.\n\nIn 1975, the U.N. General Assembly adopted resolutions endorsing the desirability of replacing the Armistice Agreement with a peace treaty and dissolving the UNC. This was followed by North Korean attempts to start peace discussions with the U.S. The U.S. however believed influencing China to restrict North Korean actions would be more effective.\n\nIn October 1996, the U.N. Security Council, by a statement of the President of the Security Council, Honduras, urged that the Armistice Agreement should be fully observed until replaced by a new peace mechanism. Approving nations included the United States and the People's Republic of China, two of the armistice's signatories, effectively refuting any suggestion that the armistice was no longer in force.\n\nNorth Korea has announced that it will no longer abide by the armistice at least 6 times, in 1994, 1996, 2003, 2006, 2009, and 2013.\n\nOn 28 April 1994, North Korea announced that it would cease participating in the Military Armistice Commission, but would continue contact at Panmunjom through liaison officers and maintain the general conditions of the armistice. North Korea stated it regarded the U.S. deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea as terminating the armistice.\n\nIn January 2002 U.S. President George W. Bush, in his first State of the Union Address, labeled North Korea a part of an Axis of Evil. In October 2006 North Korea conducted its first nuclear weapons test. There were two isolated violent incidents in 2010: the ROKS Cheonan sinking, which was attributed to North Korea, despite denials; and the North Korean Bombardment of Yeonpyeong. In 2010, the U.S. position regarding a peace treaty was that it could only be negotiated when North Korea \"takes irreversible steps toward denuclearization\".\n\nIn 2013 North Korea argued that the Armistice was meant to be a transitional measure and that North Korea had made a number of proposals for replacing the armistice with a peace treaty, but the U.S. had not responded in a serious way. It further argued that the Military Armistice Commission and the NNSC had long been effectively dismantled, paralysing the supervisory functions of the Armistice. North Korea believes the annual U.S. and South Korean exercises Key Resolve and Foal Eagle are provocative and threaten North Korea with nuclear weapons. JoongAng Ilbo reported that U.S. vessels equipped with nuclear weapons were participating in the exercise, and the Pentagon publicly announced that B-52 bombers flown over South Korea were reaffirming the U.S. \"nuclear umbrella\" for South Korea.\n\nIn March 2013, North Korea announced that it was scrapping all non-aggression pacts with South Korea. It also closed the border and closed the direct phone line between the two Koreas. North Korea further stated it had the right to make a preemptive nuclear attack. A United Nations spokesman stated that the Armistice Agreement had been adopted by the U.N. General Assembly, and could not be unilaterally dissolved by either North Korea or South Korea. On 28 March 2013, the U.S. sent two B-2 Spirit stealth bombers to South Korea to participate in ongoing military exercises in the region, including the dropping of inert munitions on a South Korean bomb range. This was the first B-2 non-stop, round-trip mission to Korea from the United States. Following this mission, North Korean state media announced that it was readying rockets to be on standby to attack U.S. targets. In May 2013, North Korea offered to enter into negotiations for a peace treaty to replace the armistice agreement.\n\nIn August 2016, North Korea installed anti-personnel mines to prevent the defection of its front-line border guards around the \"Bridge of No Return,\" situated in the Joint Security Area (JSA). The UN Command protested this move as it violates the Armistice Agreement which specifically prohibits armed guards and anti-personnel mines.\n\nIn 2016, when North Korea proposed formal peace talks, the U.S. adjusted its position from the pre-condition that North Korea should have already taken \"irreversible steps toward denuclearization\", to a negotiating stance that includes North Korea halting its nuclear program. The discussions did not take place. A State Department spokesman said that \"[North Korea] periodically raise[s] the idea and it never really gets far\".\n\nOn 27 April 2018 the Panmunjom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity and Unification on the Korean Peninsula was signed by South Korean President Moon Jae-in and the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un which commits the two countries to denuclearization and talks to bring a formal end to conflict. The two leaders agreed to, later in the year, convert the Korean Armistice Agreement into a full peace treaty, formally ending the Korean War after 65 years. The DPRK later called off talks with South Korea scheduled for 16 May, blaming U.S.-South Korean military exercises, and threw the planned 12 June summit into doubt, saying it might not attend if Washington continues to demand it unilaterally abandon its nuclear arsenal. The 2018 North Korea-United States Summit was held in Singapore on June 12, 2018 at Capella Hotel despite previous tensions before the summit. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and United States President Donald Trump signed a joint declaration that declared the following: \nThe joint statement also includes Trump's commitment to providing security guarantees to North Korea and that there will be follow-up negotiations between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and an undetermined high-level North Korean official thereafter.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un later stated that the meeting \"provided geopolitical stability and that he expects more progress in talks between his nation and Washington\" at the start of a three-day summit at which Kim is meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in Pyongyang, the pair's third meeting of the year. Kim also credited Moon with making the “historic” summit in Singapore possible. During the meeting, the two Koreas have also agreed to pursue a bid to co-host the 2032 Olympic Games in a joint statement on Wednesday following the third summit between Mr Kim and Mr Moon. The statement also said they had agreed to \"participate jointly\" at international competitions including the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.\n\nOver the years, United States Presidents have made proclamations in support of the National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day. On 26 July 2017, President Donald Trump proclaimed 27 July as National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day.\n\nNorth Korea commemorates 27 July as a national holiday known as Day of Victory in the Great Fatherland Liberation War.\n\n\n\n"}

Only a small fragment of the original document survives, describing the penalties for several offences against people.\n\nHistorically, the term \"Brets\" refers to Brythonic peoples, while \"Scots\" refers to Gaelic-speaking peoples. Skene however, asserted that here \"Scots\" refers to all of the peoples living north of the firths of Clyde and Forth.\n\nAside from the document's intrinsic importance to Scottish history, it is significant in its similarity to corresponding areas both of Irish Brehon law and of Welsh law, which are better-preserved than the laws of medieval southern Scotland, allowing reasonable conjectures to be made regarding the laws and customs of the region, as few historical records exist.\n\nThe Laws or their precursor were relevant in the early twelfth century, as the \"Laws of the Four Burghs\" (Latin: \"Leges Quatuor Burgorum\") explicitly banned parts of it relating to the \"cro\" (or weregild).\nThe Laws are known to have been relevant until 1305, as Edward I of England specifically abolished them in that year, following his invasion of Scotland. There is no further mention of them, and when Scotland successfully reasserted its independence, the feudal Scots law then became applicable.\n\nThe surviving clauses show the society's origins as a tribal culture, where a perpetrator's family is responsible for the perpetrator's transgressions, and the family of a victim is compensated for the loss of a family member. As with other Celtic societies, the rights and obligations of women are explicitly guaranteed (though at a lesser standing than that of men). Marriages are treated as relationships between different families, and payments accrue to the family of the victim's spouse under some circumstances, but accrue to the victim's family under other circumstances.\n\nDefinition of the penalties\n\n\nPenalty amount according to social position\n\nThe amounts to be paid were on a scale according to the social position of the victim, with the king at the top with the greatest value, then with a lesser amount for his son or high-ranking noble, an even lesser amount for other nobles, and so on down to the least amount for a common person. Amounts for homicide were given both as a number of cows, and as an equivalent amount of gold. Amounts for wounding or insult were given in gold only.\n\nPayments for a female victim were one third less than that of her husband (but equal to that of her brother if she were unmarried), and make clear that women retained their original kinship and rights after marriage, as death penalties were owed by her family (and not by her husband's family), while death payments were made to her family (and not to the husband's family). Also, the importance of the marriage is acknowledged in that some payments for insult accrue to the spouse of the victim, rather than to the victim's family.\n\n\nExplanatory notes\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\n"}

LSTA is a United States federal library grant program. Its roots come from the Library Services Act that was first enacted in 1956. LSTA replaced the Library Services and Construction Act (LSCA) that was first enacted in 1962. The new act was developed by the American Library Association (ALA) and other library groups.\n\nMany changes occurred with the passage of LSTA. The original act, Library Services and Construction Act (LSCA), allocated funds for construction of buildings, but LSTA has an emphasis on technology. The new priority is the creation of technological infrastructure. Another change that occurred with the passage of LSCA was the responsibility of library services. This responsibility was originally a part of the Department of Education. It was moved to the newly created, independent federal agency called the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). The range of libraries served also changed with the enactment of LSTA. Originally, public libraries were primarily served by LSCA. With the passage of LSTA, all types of libraries are served, including public, school, academic, and special.\n\nNot all initiatives under LSCA have changed with the enactment of LSTA. Priorities, like services to the under-served and rural areas, are still supported.\n\nLSCA is a federally funded state-based program generally administered by the state library of each state. Specific funding categories are set by each state based on a long-range plan filed with the IMLS.\n\n\nAmerican Library Association, Fight to Defend Federal Funding for Libraries\n"}
{"id": "62719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62719", "title": "Line-item veto in the United States", "text": "Line-item veto in the United States\n\nIn United States government, the line-item veto, or partial veto, is the power of an executive authority to nullify or cancel specific provisions of a bill, usually a budget appropriations bill, without vetoing the entire legislative package. The line-item vetoes are usually subject to the possibility of legislative override as are traditional vetoes.\n\nForty-four states—with Indiana, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Rhode Island, and Vermont as the only states that do not grant such powers—give their governors some form of line-item veto power. The Mayor of Washington, D.C. also has this power.\n\nThe Governor of Wisconsin is empowered with a sweeping line-item veto. Wisconsin governors have the power to strike out words, numbers, and even entire sentences from appropriations bills.\n\nAccording to scholars, Wisconsin has used four types of extraordinary partial vetoes. The first, the \"digit veto\", was first used by Governor Patrick Lucey in 1973. In appropriation for $25 million, he vetoed the digit 2, resulting in an appropriation of $5 million. Just two years later, Lucey introduced the \"editing veto\". In this instance, the word \"not\" was removed in the phrase \"not less than 50 percent\", thus resulting in the opposite effect than desired by the legislature. In 1983, an even more extreme version, the \"pick-a-letter\" or \"Vanna White veto\" was introduced. Governor Anthony Earl edited a 121-word, five-sentence paragraph down to a one-sentence, 22-word paragraph to change an appeals process from the courts to the Public Service Commission. The final version, the \"reduction veto\", was introduced in 1993 by Governor Tommy Thompson. This resulted in a legislatively-appropriated amount being reduced arbitrarily by the governor. This unprecedented usage has resulted in eight lawsuits and numerous amendment proposals. In the first lawsuit, \"State ex. rel. Wisconsin Telephone Co. v. Henry\", the Wisconsin Supreme Court granted absolute partial veto power to the Governor as long as a workable, complete law remained, stating the governor had \"the right to pass independently on every separable piece of legislation in an appropriation bill.\"\n\nIn his first two terms as governor, Thompson used 1,500 line-item vetoes to cancel a total of $150 million in spending; none of these vetoes were overridden. The only judicial limitation was \"Risser v. Klauser\", which prohibited the \"reduction veto\", stating that \"the constitution prohibits a writein veto of monetary figures which are not appropriation amounts.\" In 2009, a constitutional amendment was passed abolishing the \"Vanna White veto\". Yet, in 2011, Governor Scott Walker controversially crossed out 116 words in a pension-related section of the budget bill.\n\nArticle 1, Section 7 of the Confederate States Constitution, adopted just before the start of the American Civil War, would have granted the President of the Confederate States the ability to \"approve any appropriation and disapprove any other appropriation in the same bill,\" with such disapprovals returned to the Houses of Congress for reconsideration and potentially for override.\n\nPresidents of the United States have repeatedly asked the Congress to give them a line-item veto power. According to Louis Fisher in \"The Politics of Shared Power,\" Ronald Reagan said to Congress in his 1986 State of the Union address, \"Tonight I ask you to give me what forty-three governors have: Give me a line-item veto this year. Give me the authority to veto waste, and I'll take the responsibility, I'll make the cuts, I'll take the heat.\" Bill Clinton echoed the request in his State of the Union address in 1995. Congress attempted to grant this power to the president by the Line Item Veto Act of 1996 to control \"pork barrel spending\", but in 1998 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the act to be unconstitutional in a 6-3 decision in \"Clinton v. City of New York\". The court found that exercise of the line-item veto is tantamount to a unilateral amendment or repeal by the executive of only parts of statutes authorizing federal spending, and therefore violated the Presentment Clause of the United States Constitution. Thus a federal line-item veto, at least in this particular formulation, would only be possible through a constitutional amendment. Prior to that ruling, President Clinton applied the line-item veto to the federal budget 82 times.\n\nThough the Supreme Court struck down the Line-Item Veto Act in 1998, President George W. Bush asked the Congress to enact legislation that would return the line-item veto power to the Executive Authority. First announcing his intent to seek such legislation in his January 31, 2006 State of the Union address, President Bush sent a legislative proposal, the Legislative Line-Item Veto Act of 2006, to the Congress on March 6, 2006, urging its prompt passage. Senators Bill Frist (R-TN) and John McCain (R-AZ), and Republican Whip Senator Mitch McConnell (KY) jointly introduced this proposal. Representative Paul Ryan (R-WI) introduced his own version, the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006, in March of that year.\n\nOn that same day, Joshua Bolten, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, gave a press conference on the President’s line-item veto proposal. Bolten explained that the proposed Act would give the President the ability to single out \"wasteful\" spending and to put such spending on hold. While the spending line-item is on hold, the President can send legislation to Congress to withdraw the particular line-item. The proposal would then be considered in both houses within ten days on an up or down basis, and could be passed by a simple majority. Additionally, such proposals could not be filibustered.\n\nWhen asked how this proposed legislation was different from the 1996 Line-Item Veto Act that the United States Supreme Court had declared illegal, Bolten said that whereas the former act granted unilateral authority to the Executive to disallow specific spending line items, the new proposal would seek Congressional approval of such line-item vetoes. Thus, for the President to successfully withdraw previously enacted spending, a simple majority of Congress is required to agree to specific legislation to that effect.\n\nThough the 2006 line-item veto proposal was much weaker than the 1996 version, it nevertheless failed to find strong support in the Congress. Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, called it \"an offensive slap at Congress\", asserting that the legislation would enable the President to intimidate individual members of any Congress by targeting the projects of his political opponents. He also complained that the line-item veto as proposed would take away the Congress’s constitutional \"power of the purse\" and give it to the executive branch.\n\nOn June 8, 2006, Viet D. Dinh, Professor of Law at Georgetown University Law Center, and Nathan Sales, John M. Olin Fellow at Georgetown University Law Center, testified by written statement before the House Committee on the Budget on the constitutional issues in connection with the proposed legislation. Dinh and Sales argued that the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 satisfies the Constitution's Bicameralism and Presentment Clause, and therefore avoids the constitutional issues raised in the 1996 Act struck down by the Supreme Court. They also stated that the proposed Act is consistent with the basic principle that grants the Congress broad discretion to establish procedures to govern its internal operations.\n\nH.R. 4890, the Legislative Line-Item Veto Act, was approved by the House Budget Committee on June 14, 2006 by a vote of 24-9. It was approved in the full House on June 22. A similar version was included in the \"Stop Over Spending Act of 2006\", authored by Senator Judd Gregg, in the Senate and approved by the Senate Budget Committee, but the full Senate failed to approve it, thereby preventing the Legislative Line-Item Veto Act from becoming law.\n\nIn 2009, Senators Russ Feingold (D-WI) and John McCain introduced legislation of a limited version of the line-item veto. This bill would give the president the power to withdraw earmarks in new bills by sending the bill back to Congress minus the line-item vetoed earmark. Congress would then vote on the line-item vetoed bill with a majority vote under fast track rules to make any deadlines the bill had.\n\nSome scholars, such as Louis Fisher, believe the line-item veto would give presidents too much power over government spending compared with the power of the Congress. Some argue that it could even give the President \"de facto\" legislative authority in altering the law which could violate the principles, and perhaps even the letter, of the Constitution.\n\nSupporters of the line-item veto argue that the provision would make the President more accountable for federal spending. Also, the line-item veto can be used to prevent the enactment of controversial rider amendments that powerful legislators have sometimes inserted into important bills, or at least it can be used to ensure that someone elected at the national level is accountable for the enactment of such amendments. Without the line-item veto, Presidents have often felt compelled to sign controversial riders into law even if they did not support them. Bob Barr's former 2008 Libertarian Party running mate Wayne Root has also endorsed the line-item veto to go with his libertarian political views on spending while also suggesting the lifting of the Congressional ban on presidents impounding bills.\n\n\n"}

His rationalism is a neo-Leibnizian approach both in metaphysics and law.\n\nLorenzo Peña was born in Alicante, Spain, on August 29, 1944. Persecuted by Franco's regime, his mother (born in the Madrid Royal Palace in 1911) was not allowed to return to the Spanish capital city until 1952.\n\nIn Madrid Peña was taught Greek and Indoeuropean linguistics by the renowned Spanish philologist Francisco Rodríguez Adrados and ethics by J.L. Aranguren.\n\nUpon becoming a political activist in February 1962, he was forced to emigrate in the spring 1965. In early 1969 he married his class-mate María Teresa Alonso in Meudon (France). While staying in Paris he was a disciple of the French historian Pierre Vilar and he witnessed the upheaval of May 1968. He gave up all clandestine activities in 1972. After spending 18 years in exile, he went back to Spain in 1983.\n\nIn 1974 Peña was awarded his philosophy degree (\"licenciatura\") from the PUCE (the Ecuadorian Pontifical University in Quito), with a thesis on Anselm of Canterbury's Ontological argument for the existence of God, his adviser being Julio C. Terán, S.J., who taught him hermeneutics. He then spent four years in Liège, Belgium, (1975–1979) where, under Paul Gochet's supervision, he wrote his dissertation on a system of contradictorial (paraconsistent) logic. At that time he was also granted a complementary degree in American Studies by the University of Liège.\n\nUpon receiving his Ph.D. in 1979, he came back to Ecuador. He was a professor at the PUCE for four years and later on, after returning to Spain, at León University for another three years. In 1987 he was appointed senior scientific researcher at the CSIC (Spanish National Research Council, Spain's main academic research institution).\n\nHe spent six months in Canberra as a visiting scholar (1992–1993), under the guidance of the late Richard Sylvan, and was a colleague of Philip Pettit at the philosophy department of the Australian National University. Later on he shifted his research orientation to the philosophy of law. He became a lawyer by earning first an M.L. (DEA) from Autonomous University of Madrid in 2007 and then a PhD in Law (Doctor of Juridical Science) from the same University in 2015 with a doctoral dissertation entitled IDEA IURIS LOGICA. In 2008 he enrolled with the Madrid Bar Association of Advocates. He reached the highest academic professional level (Research Professor) in 2006.\n\nIn August 2014 he underwent compulsory retirement but was granted the title of honorary Professor at his academic institution, the CSIC. As such he was appointed co-PI (Principal Investigator) of a new R+D project on the legal and ethical responsibility of omissions (2014-2017).\n\nPeña is the founder of the digital journal \n\"SORITES\" (1995-2008) and also the founder and former leader of JuriLog (Logical Jurisprudence), the logic-and-law research group at the CSIC, which is carrying out an inquiry into nomological concepts and values.\n\nOntophantics is the system of philosophical conceptions developed by Peña in the years 1974–1995 (which do not necessarily coincide with those he has developed in recent years).\n\nAlthough ontophantics is essentially a metaphysical doctrine, its starting point was a methodological approach through the philosophy of language, based on a realist semiotic theory to the effect that what is shown by language is also said (as against the Tractarian dichotomy), namely reality or being. Rather than regarding sentences and states of affairs in a static way, as logical atomists have done, ontophantics looks upon them dynamically, as transitions or processes. To utter a statement is not a mere series of successive actions of uttering the sentence's components but a transit from one saying into another along a temporal dimension. Likewise facts are nontemporal transitions consisting in a relation passing from one thing to another.\n\nSince all passages seem to be subject to Zeno's paradox of the arrow, a \nparaconsistent logic is resorted to in order to solve the puzzle. Instead of blaming contradictions on thought or language Peña ascribes them to reality by embracing a non-classical logic.\n\nAnother feature of ontophantics is the rejection of all forms of essentialism in the sense of considering attributions of being-so independent of assertions of being or existence—an opinion Peña attributes to Aristotle and Alexius Meinong. Peña's existence-oriented ontology identifies each entity with a fact, its existence. Ontological truth is also identified with existence, which is a reduplicative property. Ontophantics follows Frege's view of sentences as names of objects, but in this case the objects under consideration are states of affairs. From a linguistic perspective phenomena of nominalization are thus gone into from an outlook which eliminates any categorical cleavages. Such a metaphysical theory is strongly Platonistic. Ontophantics is also a modal realism, which takes reality to be all-encompassing, and thus comprising non-actual worlds.\n\nOntophantics contains a holistic theory of knowledge influenced by Gonseth and Quine, considering the cleavage between analytic and synthetic judgments a matter of degree. This epistemological holism is a sort of empirical coherentism, for which the task of human knowledge is to set up theories, to confront them with experience taken as a whole and to gradually modify them. Not only foundationalism of any kind is rejected but reliabilism is not accepted either, since no procedure is to be unconditionally trusted come what may.\n\nPeña rehabilitates induction as a sound ground even for logical truths (he follows the outdated opinion of John Stuart Mill). The choice among alternative logical systems has to be made in accordance with plausible criteria, one of which is fitness with the best explanation of available evidence, thus resorting to an optimization postulate, which in turn gets circularly warranted by its epistemological fruitness.\n\nThat optimization postulate is a rationality ideal which also provides a ground for assuming God's existence. Peña's first published book, \"The coincidence of opposites in God\" (Quito, 1981), was a discussion of the proofs of God's inexistence canvassed in the analytical philosophy of religion. He broached the question through a combination of a contradictorial logic and a non-standard set theory (in a way a mirror reversion of Quine's ML system), which regards infinite entities as not being subject to the principle of separation in virtue of which a thing is comprised by the set of entities with a certain characteristic only to the extent it has that characteristic. In that book he adopted determinism and rejected free will, a position he has maintained ever since, using it as a lever while grappling with issues in the philosophy of law.\n\nAs against other persuasions in paraconsistent logic (such as relevantism and the Brazilian school), the paraconsistent treatment developed by Peña, which belongs in the fuzzy family founded by Lotfi A. Zadeh, regards true contradictions as situations wherein a state of affairs enjoys only partial existence. His approach to fuzziness deviates from Zadeh's mainstream orthodoxy in rejecting alethic maximalism and so embracing the principle of excluded middle, regarding all intermediaries as degrees of both truth and falseness, being and non-being (Plato's influence is discernable here).\n\nIn order to clarify his philosophical proposal Peña has set up several systems of sentential and quantificational logic which he calls «transitive logic», TL, as partial implementations of his programme. TL is characterized by a couple of negations, one strong («not at all»), which has all classical properties, and a weak one (a mere «not»), which is degree-sensitive. The fragment of TL without strong negation is a non-conservative extension of Alan Ross Anderson and Nuel Belnap's logic of relevance, \"E\", (by adding the funnel principle, namely that either A implies B or else A; in other words, what is not true at all implies anything). Transitive implication is partly similar to relevant implication (although much stronger), but its underlying philosophical motivation is entirely different, since it is read «to the extent [at least] that...». The fragment of TL without weak negation and the implication operator is classical logic. TL is thus a logical blend or rather a crossbreed.\n\nPeña's plan to investigate the grounds of his logical system as a nonclassical combinatory logic has thus far remained programmatic, but the combinatory account fits his metaphysical approach.\n\nCumulativism is Peña's philosophical orientation as developed from 1996 onwards. Cumulativism is contradictorial gradualism with an added emphasis on six hitherto partly implicit components of his approach: (1) All transitions are either continuous or at least supervene on underlying continuous mutations, going through successive steps; hence change is always slow and implies a succession of stages, each of which keeps many qualities of the previous stage. (2) All transitions are either aggregations or disaggregations (processes of sedimentation or erosion) since cumulation, gathering, is reality's most prominent feature (ontophantics had already conceived of all entities as sets, but now the principle of togetherness is made the mainstay of the philosophical system). (3) Metaphysical isolationism is avoided by espousing collectivism both in metaphysics and political philosophy. (4) A programme of conceptual flexibilization is proposed, by which concepts become soft, fluid, with shifting borders. (5) The gatherings or clusters this approach advances are called \"cumuli\", \"cumulations\"—so as not to be mistaken for sets in the sense of standard set-theory—the main idea remaining that not all things congregated by a cluster necessarily share the cluster's defining charasterictic (and, more generally, the Meinongian description principle fails, namely that the entity which is thus-and-so is indeed thus-and-so). (6) As a compendium, cumulativism is taken to be the philosophy of conjunction: A-and-B is a conjunctive state of affairs which exists to the extent A and B exist. A-and-B's own properties supervene on those held by A and B.\n\nPeña's work on deontic logic began short after his 1979 Ph.D. diss. The first paper he published on the issue appeared in 1988. At that time, he essentially clung to von Wright's standard approach, departing from it only by introducing degrees and admitting normative contradictions or antinomies. He soon became dissatisfied with that scheme which proved to be incompatible with serious applications of deontic logic to the practice of legal reasoning. He found out the flaw was to think of deontic logic as a species of the genus modal logic by stressing the similarities between duty and necessity, and between licitness and possibility.\n\nThe underlying mistake, according to Peña, is a wrong metaphysical assumption which denies the existence of deontic states of affairs connected by implications. That denial pushes deontic logicians to conceive of deontic logic as the logic of duty-compliances. Thus if A necessarily implies B, standard deontic logic believes that the duty to do A implies a duty to do B—this is the rule of logical closure. That rule is one of the first dogmas waived by Peña's deontic approach.\n\nPeña was thus prompted to produce a new system of deontic logic, \"Nomological Logic\", or NL (also called 'Juristic Logic'), combining a number of particularities which make it unique:\n\nPeña claims that the valid principles of logic in general and deontic logic in particular are found by induction, or rather abduction, through a circular holistic process. It is only by studying normative reasoning as it really happens in legal practice that sanitized sets of axioms and inference rules can be devised and then subject to the acid test of applicability.\n\nPeña has proposed a pluralistic axiology in order to deal with the debate between deontological and consequentialist approaches in ethics.\n\nPeña classifies ethical theories into two groups: internalism and externalism, the former valuing conducts according to intrinsic features. Externalism comes in two ways: antecedentalism and consequentialism. There are two sorts of consequentialism: monistic and pluralistic, the former maintaining that there is one ethical property practical consequences of actions must have in order to render the action ethically valuable. Utilitarianism is a monist consequentialism.\n\nPeña is a pluralist. He is inclined to a pluralistic consequentialism, but his approach can be taken to transcend the very dichotomy, since, once no unique criterion is looked for, actions ought to be assessed in a number of ways according to different values, some of which are not necessarily teleological. Since the approach is gradualistic, ethical valuations are taken to be scales with infinitely many degrees combined in infinitely complex compositions. Withal, the nearer a causal consequence of our action is, the higher its ethical significance. Peña implements ethical pluralistic gradualism through his paraconsistent fuzzy logic: actions can be regarded as both good and bad, better in certain respects and worse in other respects.\n\nAs for the units of behaviour to be assessed, Peña's ideas are close to virtue ethics in that he thinks isolated actions are generally too narrow unities to be reasonably appraised, although a whole course of life is too broad. Something in-between is a more adequate candidate, which means a span of one's life evincing a continuation of purposes, choices and habits.\n\nPeña admits that a pluralistic axiology faces a serious difficulty, namely that it provides no clear guidance for action, unless there is an objective all-things-considered perspective. He claims that sometimes there is no such perspective and that in those cases choices are justified by one's previous allegiance to the prevalence of certain values. But even when an all-things-considered outlook is warranted, its existence does not mean that contradictory valuations are merely \"prima facie\". Thus ethical contradictions cannot be evaded.\n\nAs against all who claim that progress is a vapid concept and that there is no continuous improvement along history, Peña's philosophy of history argues that progress is the necessary outcome of our cultural rationality—weak and partial though it is—thanks to which any human society will tend to ameliorate its welfare by blending the scattered wisdom of its members into a combined collective purposive intelligence, thus increasing, little by little, its social accumulation of material and intellectual assets, establishing more workable, reliable and socially acceptable laws and making distribution practices more consonant with the public interest.\n\nHuman progress being continuous, no historic leaps are possible and so there is no objective ground for any periodization. Any delimitation of epochs is a matter of mere convenience. The law of human progress is not to be assimilated to grand schemes postulating a predetermined succession of ages, such as those of the Stoics, Vico, Hegel, A. Comte and K. Marx.\n\nPeña's philosophy of history shares with those forerunners the view of human history as universal, both backwards and forwards. There is a common ancestry, which entails that at least a few elements of disparate human traditions go back to our shared origin. Those elements have been, time and again, strengthened by the mutual borrowing of concepts, techniques, institutions and procedures. There is also a common destination, owing to our shared Planet and a converging tendency, which needs no mysterious invisible hand but results from objective constraints.\n\nPeña's philosophy of history acknowledges collective minds, which supervene on individual minds. No society can exist without a common memory and common plans of living-together and reaching common aims (which does not mean that all members of the body politic share those feelings; Peña rejects any mandatory imposition of beliefs or values).\n\nPeña does not deny the existence of historic breaks caused by social involutions and disasters (wars, foreign subjugations, natural catastrophes) but thinks that every human society finds its way to restart the ascending march.\n\nPeña maintains that future-oriented improvement is the sense of human life, both individual and collective; so much so that a fundamental right of man is the right to have a better life—as far as possible. This general right encompasses particular welfare rights, such as the rights to food, to work, to have a dwelling, to mobility and so on, all of which ought to be considered dynamically.\n\nPeña's legal philosophy is a natural-law theory deriving from Aquinas's conception of law as an ordinance of reason for the common good. Some of those ordinances are promulgated by legislators by means of certain speech acts; others, natural-law norms, stem from the very nature of social relations. As against social-covenant views, Peña regards human beings as naturally social, antecedently banded together into a community under an established authority, whose duty is to pursue the public interest. Peña claims that inhabitants of the land enter a quasi-contract by growing up within society and benefiting from established social institutions, thus committing themselves to contribute to the common good and to subordinate their particular interests to those of society as a whole and to the needs of such people as are worse-off.\n\nOne of the main claims this social philosophy advances is the rejection of the dichotomy between State and civil society, a contrived duality which he blames as the root of serious misconceptions. The primeval meaning of «Republic» being the State, «republicanism» primarily means giving some prominence to the \"public\" mission vested in the State, by promoting or favouring the government's intervention and the domain of resources publicly managed—provided, that is, that such a State has no hereditary ruler.\n\nPeña has coined the pleonasm «republican republicanism» (or its alternative wording «public republicanism») to designate his political ideas, according to which the State's job is to pursue the common welfare by organizing the public services. Peña claims that there has never been a minimal state concerned with keeping law and order and nothing else. On the contrary, all states have undertaken a broad range of productive activities without which no private enterprise would have been workable at all.\n\nRepublican republicanism is thus a political philosophy tending to increase the scope of activities entrusted to the State, by setting up a planned economy with a powerful public sector and a gradual socialization of property; in the meanwhile private ownership has to be fraught with legal burdens for the common good. This doctrine borrows a number of ideas from the traditions of the British Fabian Society, French solidarism and German chair-socialism as well as the Spanish school of Krausist philosophers and lawyers who inspired the II Republic (1931–1939), whose Constitution he takes as a paradigm.\n\nPeña's republicanism implies the rejection of all forms of market economy, including market socialism. He contends that the State's patronage and intervention can alone bring a sense of directedness and unity of purpose, failing which the only practicable way is mercantile competition, with its dreary, ruthless consequences.\n\nAccording to Peña, republican republicanism differs in four ways from civic neo-republicanism, or civicism. For one thing, it rejects monarchy, while civicism is not concerned over the political form of government. For another, it is statist, while civicists in the main agree with libertarians and liberals in viewing the public arena as a neutral ground within which private endeavours and undertakings are pursued by citizens, companies or other private clubs. Third, civicism promotes such private virtues as foster participation in public institutions, whereas Peña's republicanism recognizes the right of individuals not to be concerned with public issues. And fourth, civicism professes one value, freedom, understood as non-domination, while, as we have already seen, Peña espouses a plurality of values: thriving or welfare (akin to Martha Nussbaum's flourishing), love, liberty, rationality, brotherhood, equality and living-together, owing to which normative and axiological contradictions are unavoidable. Dealing with those contradictions needs weighing and proportion (contradictorial gradualism bears out this proposal).\n\nAn essential component of Peña's republicanism is the proposal of an Earthian Republic. Peña views regional blocks as splits of the human family bringing about enmities and conflicts of interest rather than a fraternal union, which he champions on the ground of both prudential and axiological considerations.\n\n\n\n"}

The charter is primarily concerned with the relationship between the Earl of Chester and his barons, though the final clause states that the barons must allow similar concessions to their own tenants.\n\nThe Runnymede Charter of Liberties did not apply to the shire of Chester, which at the time was a separate feudal domain. At the petitions of his barons, the Earl of Chester, Ranulf III set out his own charter. The similarities between many of the clauses in the Magna Carta of Chester and those in the Magna Carta indicates that it was written after King John issued the latter on 19 June 1215.\n\nIn the early 1200s, the Earldom of Chester was the only county palatine on the Welsh Marches; Ranulf III ruled Chester as a separate feudal domain. His barons living outside of Cheshire are referred to as his 'knights from England'. In the late 12th century manuscript \"De laude Cestrie\", Lucian of Chester describes the county as obedient, 'more to the sword of its prince than to the crown of the king.'\n\nRanulf III had been loyal to the king during the First Barons' War and had supported the \"Magna Carta\". Ranulf III, William Marshal, the Earl of Derby and Earl of Warwick were the only members of the nobility to support the king. In 1215, Ranulf was one of the few magnates to serve as a witness for the Magna Carta.\n\nBefore John's death in 1216, rebel barons offered the throne of England to Prince Louis of France. Louis arrived in England unopposed in the summer of 1216 and took Winchester. Ranulf was an outspoken supporter for the re-issuing of the Magna Carta after Louis' retreat in 1217. He also witnessed the 1225 re-issue of the Runnymead \"Magna Carta\". His general support for John's \"Magna Carta\", makes the issuing of his own no surprise.\n\nThe charter is recorded as having been issued, 'at the petition of the barons of Cheshire,' suggesting that they were sufficiently discontented that Ranulf III attempted to pacify them before taking the cross.\n\nThe charter has 13 clauses, in contrast to the 60 of the \"Magna Carta\".\n\nSeveral clauses approach issues found in the Runnymede charter, but in a different way. Clauses 1 and 4 deal with the rival claims of the earl's court and barons' courts to jurisdiction over tenants living on baronial estates. Clause 1 acknowledges the earl's right to judge the most serious offences, but Clause 4 allows defendants of his court to plea 'thwetnic' (total denial), on which the defendant would be released to the jurisdiction of their baron.\n\nClauses 2 and 3 refer to the system whereby fugitive villeins from outside the county, including those fleeing justice, could take refuge on the estates of the earl or his barons. This was accompanied by an obligation on the part of male fugitives to provide labour and military service.\n\nClause 5 limits penalties that the earl's court could apply, but Graeme White argues that this applied only to the specific of non-attendance by judges and suitors; a far more restricted context than that specified in \"Magna Carta\" clauses 20 and 21. Clause Six grants various rights within the Cheshire forests: to assart, cultivate land and sell dead wood. Clause 8 protects widows and heirs, but makes no specific mention of wardship.\n\nClause 9 raises the issue whereby urban residence for a year and day would secure an individual freedom from villeinage. Migration from the countryside into Chester - prospering as a port in the wake of Henry II’s acquisitions in Ireland - was of concern to the Cheshire barons, who wanted their entitlements to reclaim their villeins spelled out.\n\nClause 10 concerns limits to military service and castle-guard duty, similar to \"Magna Carta\" clauses 16 and 29. However, Clause 10 goes into a level of detail befitting a frontier county accustomed to threatened or actual attack from the Welsh. Significant points here include the treatment of the Lyme as a border beyond which Cheshire knights are not obliged to fight and the expectation that the garrisoning of Chester castle should fall primarily upon fees of the honour outside the county.\n\nClause 11 limits the provisions that could be claimed by officials. This clause resembles \"Magna Carta\" Clause 28, although the Cheshire charter focusses specifically upon the entitlements of itinerant law-enforcement officers.\n\nClause 12 of the charter has no counterpart in the \"Magna Carta\". Ranulf III was quite happy to itemise the petitions he had turned down, most of which were related to the aspirations of particular individuals or interest-groups, rather than the baronial community as a whole.\n\nThe steward mentioned was Roger de Montalt, who held land on the south-west side of the Dee estuary; he was well-placed to profit from accidents to ships using the port of Chester. The reference to, 'the coursing of their hares in the forest on the way to, or returning from Chester in response to a summons,' suggests that the barons were hoping that sport would be laid on whenever they were summoned to Chester.\n\nMany phrases in the Cheshire charter are similar to those in the \"Magna Carta\" and appear to have been adapted directly from it. Clause 1 in the Cheshire charter refers to 'pleas of the sword' (\"exceptis placitis ad gladium meum pertinentibus\"), similar to Clause One of the Magna Carta's 'pleas of the Crown.' Similarly, Clauses 1 and 4 conclude with references to a private prosecutor and witnesses respectively, paralleling the provisions made in \"Magna Carta\" Clause 38 to prevent unsupported allegations by local officials.\n\nClause 6 grants the Cheshire barons rights within the Cheshire forests to: assart; cultivate land; and sell dead wood. In contrast to the 'forest clauses' of the \"Magna Carta\" (44, 47 and 48), there is no mention of disafforestation or curbing officials.\n\nClause 8 protects widows and heirs, but makes no specific mention of wardship. The clause is so brief that it suggests the outrage fuelling \"Magna Carta\" Clauses 2 - 8 were of less concern to the barons of Cheshire.\n\nClause 13 contains the strongest link to the \"Magna Carta\", with its insistence that, ‘all common knights and free tenants of the whole of Cheshire,’ should enjoy the same treatment from the barons, as the barons would have from the earl. This parallels the \"Magna Carta's\" Clause 60, which extends its concessions to ‘all men of our realm’.\n\nWhen the \"Magna Carta\" was reconfirmed in 1300 by Edward I, the Earldom of Chester had already belonged to the king for 63 years, thus the \"Magna Carta\" applied to Cheshire. However, the Cheshire charter was also confirmed on 30 March 1300. The charter had previously been reissued on 27 August 1265, after the Battle of Evesham to reward the county for its support.\n\n\n"}

The victims - two physicians - were shot to death in their home, apparently during an attempted robbery. The principal evidence against them at the trial was the evidence of Deborah Ann Kidd, who testified she was one of the group, and that Creamer was the shooter. In 1974, Georgia State Supreme Court unanimously upheld all the convictions and sentences.\n\nIn 1975, it emerged from an investigation by the Atlanta Constitution newspaper that Kidd's testimony was probably false. She said she was under the influence of drugs when the crime had occurred and remembered little of it, and her full account was recovered with the aid of an hypnotist. Although the tapes of the hypnosis session showed that the hypnotist had suggested the incriminating material to which Kidd confessed, and one woman she named as participating in the crime was proven to be out of state at the time, the defense was not given transcripts of the sessions nor informed about her false identification. Kidd had also given many incompatible versions of events that transpired at the crime scene, which the defense team did not receive. It was later discovered that Kidd was romantically involved with one of the detectives assigned to the case.\n\nDuring the course of appeals, Kidd admitted she lied in her original testimony, and Billy Birt, a death-row inmate, confessed that he and two other men had committed the murder.

After many weeks in which Mona conducted long private conversations in English with Rahum through the instant messenger program ICQ, during which she masqueraded as a Jewish immigrant from Morocco named Sally, Mona managed to gain his confidence and get him to meet with her in Jerusalem, supposedly for romantic purposes. When he arrived for the meeting, she drove him through the border control into the Palestinian-controlled territory and towards a secluded area on the outskirts of Ramallah where Palestinian terrorists shot him at close range, with Mona standing aside and watching.\n\nMona Awana, later arrested by the Israeli police, stated that on the day of the lynching of two Israeli soldiers in Ramallah in late 2000 by a Palestinian crowd, she decided to abduct an Israeli and murder him. Mona had been present at the Ramallah lynching, and said she was \"excited\" by what she saw. Soon after, she began contacting Israelis on the Internet. Awana chatted with several Israeli teenagers on chat rooms and engaged in an online romance with Rahum. In conversations over several months she pressed for a meeting in Jerusalem. When Rahum suggested a venue closer to his home, she claimed she had no car but promised to arrange for his return by 5 P.M. Employing sexual innuendos, she persuaded him to meet her. Two days before the murder, she wrote, \"You don't know how much I am waiting for Wednesday.\" When they met, she convinced him to accompany her to Ramallah.\n\nOn 17 January 2001, Mona and Rahum met at the central bus station in Jerusalem, spoke briefly in English, and then got on a taxi which drove to the el-Ram intersection. From there they drove in a Ford Escort with Israeli license plates, through the border control into the Palestinian-controlled territory and towards the outskirts of Ramallah. When Rahum questioned Mona why they were traveling through Arab-dominant areas, Mona replied that \"that's the way it is in Jerusalem, which has both Arab and Jewish neighborhoods.\"\n\nAt 11:30, Mona stopped the car at a secluded area on the outskirts of Ramallah next to a car with Palestinian license plates, at a location which was chosen in advance with the Palestinian militant cell. Mona immediately jumped out of the vehicle, while the militants, Hassan Alkadi and Abdul Fatah Doleh, armed with rifles, got out of their car and shot Rahum from close range more than 15 times, while all along Mona was standing aside and watching. Afterwards, the assailants threw Rahum's body into the trunk and fled to Ramallah.\n\nThe assailants secretly buried Rahum's body in the al-Tira neighborhood in Ramallah.\n\nAfter Rahum did not return home from school, his family began looking for him, and found out that he did not go to school that day. Following further investigation by the Israeli Shin Bet security agency and the Israeli International Crimes Unit, it was revealed that Rahum corresponded with Mona through the Internet and that she pressed Rahum to meet with her in Jerusalem, and that she promised to have intimate relations with him.\n\nMeanwhile, an undercover Israeli Duvdevan Unit force, in conjunction with the Shin Bet, raided Mona's house in Bir Nabala and managed to apprehend Mona. She was later interrogated by the Shin Bet.\n\nOn 18 January, Palestinian security forces located Rahum's body and brought it to the Ramallah hospital. A short time later, his body was transferred to Israel.\n\nAlthough Mona initially refused to cooperate with the investigators, she broke down after about four weeks and gave a full confession of her involvement in the murder, and revealed the identities of her partners in crime – the senior Ramallah-area Fatah Tanzim operatives Hassan Alkadi and Abdul Fatah Doleh of Beitunia.\n\nThe murder caused great shock amongst the Israeli public. The Israeli Prime Minister and Defense Minister Ehud Barak stated in response to the murder that the attack was a \"heinous crime committed by vile killers, lacking human dignity. The Security forces will not spare any effort to reach the murderers so that they would be punished severely.\" Thousands of people attended Rahum's funeral which was held on 19 January at noon in the Ashkelon cemetery. Rahum's gravestone was built in the form of a personal computer.\nIsrael's Permanent Representative to the United Nations wrote to the Secretary-General to protest the \"recent acts of Palestinian terrorism directed against Israeli civilians\".\n\nAwana was tried, and eventually convicted of murder in February 2003 and sentenced to life imprisonment. She was later transferred to the Neveh Tirza prison in 2006 after attacking another inmate.\n\nThough the Israeli government initially said that Awana would not be part of the deal, she was released to Gaza on 18 October 2011 as part of the Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange between Israel and Hamas. Awana is now residing in exile in Turkey.\n\nOn 20 December 2011, Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas privately met Awana in Ankara, for which he was criticized by Israel. Abbas said that the release of the remaining Palestinian prisoners in Israel was at the top of the Palestinian agenda. An Israeli government spokesman said that the Israeli government was \"disappointed\" by this decision, and that \"instead of promoting peace and reconciliation, the Palestinian leadership seems to be putting extremist murderers up on a pedestal. This raises serious questions as to their commitment and as to their desire to end the conflict.\"\n\n\n"}

This was followed by the 1873 land emancipation act.\nThe Ottoman Land Code of 1858, prepared by the Tanzimat Council, was an original Ottoman creation, neither European nor entirely Islamic. It was founded on traditional land practices and included categories of land cited in Islamic law.\n\nPrior to 1858, land in Ottoman Syria, then a part of the Ottoman Empire since 1516, was cultivated or occupied mainly by peasants. Land ownership was regulated by people living on the land according to customs and traditions. Usually, land was communally owned by village residents, though land could be owned by individuals or families. The Ottoman Empire classified land into five categories:\n\"1)\"Arazi Memluke\"- Lands held in fee simple, freehold lands\n2)\"Arazi Mirie\"- Crown lands belonging to the state exchequer\n3)\"Arazi Mevkufe\"- Lands possessed in mortmain, but tenanted by a kind of copyhold\n4)\"Arazi Metruke\"- Lands abandoned without cultivation or ostensible owner\n5)\"Arazi Mevat\"- Dead lands, uncultivated and unappropriated.\n\n\"Arazi Memluke\" lands were properties that were owned by private individuals that were collected through conquest, state endowment, or inheritance. These lands were subject to taxation by the Ottoman Empire. \"Arazi Mirie\" lands were state owned properties that the Ottoman sultan could bestow to loyal subjects, viziers, and military commanders (these lands were kept through payments to the Ottoman Empire).\"Arazi Mevkufe\" is land constituting \"Arazi Memluke\" which has been made \"Vakf\" in accordance with the Sharia. \"Vakf\" means that the Ottoman Sultan has assigned the tithes or taxes to a specific object as opposed to an individual. \"Arazi Metruke\" is land that has been allocated for public use (ex. roads). \"Arazi Mevat\" is land that nobody has claimed ownership of which has subsequently been neglected and remains uncultivated\".\n\nIn 1858 the Ottoman Empire introduced \"The Ottoman Land Code of 1858\", requiring land owners to register ownership. The reasons behind the law were twofold. (1) to increase tax revenue, and (2) to exercise greater state control over the area. Peasants, however, saw no need to register claims, for several reasons:\n\n\nThe registration process itself was open to manipulation. Land collectively owned by village residents was registered in the name of a single landowner, with merchants and local Ottoman administrators registering large stretches of land in their own name. The result was land that became the legal property of people who may have never lived there, while peasants, even those who had lived on the land for generations, became tenants of absentee owners.\n\nPrior to the enactment of the Ottoman Land Code, 1858, land was held by virtue of Sultanic decrees, grants made by conquerors of various areas, judgments of both civil and Muslim religious courts, orders of administrative authorities and deeds of sale executed before the Muslim courts. Encroachment on unoccupied land belonging to the State and various other unauthorised methods accounted for large holdings. Land acquired by lawful means (such as grant from a competent authority) was, in theory at least, reported to Constantinople, where an effort was made to maintain a series of registers known as the \"daftar khaqani\" (imperial land registers). With the enactment of the Ottoman Land Code, that same year the Turkish Government also passed the Land Registration Law of 1858, for better regulation of its land tenure laws, and, by way of extension, a more efficient way of levying taxes on property.\n\nThe Ottoman land law classifies land under five kinds or categories. These, with suggested approximate counterparts in English, are as follows: \n\n\nThe extent to which each of these modes of law applied to the several countries under Ottoman rule varied, and was largely dependent upon the country itself. For example, not all of these modes of user were actually found in Palestine. The extent of \"mulk\" or allodial lands (privately owned property) in Palestine was limited, and was usually only found in the old cities or in garden areas. Rural land in this category was rare. In nearly all cases (excluding only “Waqf” lands, and communal \"profits-à-prendre\" land, or dead and undeveloped land), lands were either \"mulk\" or \"miri\" tenures.\n\nWhen the British assumed control over Palestine at the end of 1917 with the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire, they applied the Ottoman laws of the \"Ottoman Land Code of 1858\" to all inhabitants. At the time of the British occupation the land tax was collected at the rate of 12 \"per cent.\" of the gross yield of the land. Crops were assessed on the threshing floor or in the field and the tithe was collected from the cultivators. In 1925, additional legislation provided that taxation on crops and other produce not exceed 10%. In 1928, as a measure of reform, the Mandate Government of Palestine began to apply an Ordinance for the \"Commutation of Tithes,\" this tax in effect being a fixed aggregate amount paid annually. It was related to the average amount of tithe (tax) that had been paid by the village during the four years immediately preceding the application of the Ordinance to it.\n"}
{"id": "11970480", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11970480", "title": "Pratt C. Remmel", "text": "Pratt C. Remmel\n\nPratt Cates Remmel, Sr. (October 26, 1915May 14, 1991), was the only 20th century Republican elected on a partisan ballot to have served as mayor of the capital city of Little Rock, Arkansas.\n\nRemmel was elected to the first of two two-year terms in 1951, was reelected in 1953, and then defeated in 1955 by the Democrat Woodrow Wilson Mann, who like Remmel was engaged in the insurance business. In 1954, Remmel was the unsuccessful Republican gubernatorial candidate against the Democrat Orval Faubus, who won the first of his six consecutive two-year terms as the state's highest constitutional officer. Remmel's 37 percent of the general election vote was the greatest then attained by a Republican candidate since Reconstruction. In some ways, he paved the beginning of a long route that would bring fellow Republican Winthrop Rockefeller to the governorship in 1967. Rockefeller moved into the state only a year before Remmel ran for governor.\n\nRemmel was born in Little Rock to former Arkansas Republican state chairman Augustus Caleb \"Gus\" Remmel (1882–1920) and the former Ellen Lucy \"Nell\" Cates (1888–1961), who was the Arkansas Republican national committeewoman, a position equivalent to membership on the Republican National Committee, having served from 1928 until 1957. Remmel's father died when he was five, and his mother reared her children without a husband. One of Remmel's great-uncles, Harmon Liveright Remmel (1852–1927, usually known as H. L. Remmel), served as Republican state chairman from 1900 to 1925 and GOP national committeeman in 1924 and ran unsuccessfully for Arkansas governor in 1894, 1896, and 1900 and for the United States Senate in 1916.\n\nRemmel graduated from Little Rock High School in 1933. In 1937, he received a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Virginia at Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nDuring World War II, Remmel was a United States Navy lieutenant, a pilot, and flight instructor.\n\nRemmel married the former Catherine Couch (April 22, 1918 – January 24, 2006), the daughter of Harvey C. Couch of Pine Bluff, the founder of Arkansas Power & Light (a subsidiary of Entergy) and the director the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. Lake Catherine near Hot Springs in Garland County is named for Catherine Couch Remmel.\n\nRemmel spent decades trying to build the Arkansas Republican Party. In 1940, he became chairman of the Pulaski County (Little Rock) Republican Executive Committee. Thereafter, at various times he was treasurer of the Republican State Central Committee, finance director of the Arkansas Republican Party (1949–1951), chairman of the Young Republicans of Arkansas and vice chairman of the Young Republican National Federation. Remmel attended the national Republican conventions as a delegate in 1952 and 1956 and as an alternate in 1948 and 1960.\n\nIn the 1951 mayoral race, Remmel unseated the Democrat Sam M. Wassell, who sought a rarely given third term. Not since Ben D. Brickhouse (1919–1925) had anyone served longer than four years as mayor of Little Rock. Wassell ignored Remmel, for he viewed the Republican nominee as too weak to warrant the reactivation of the precinct organization from the summer Democratic primary. Wassell claimed incorrectly that a Republican could not be elected in Little Rock because the party during Reconstruction had \"left such an awful stink they haven't been back in seventy years.\"\n\nRemmel termed the Wassell administration \"ineffectual, half-hearted, do-nothing government\". Near the end of the race when Wassell detected that Remmel was making rapid gains, the mayor listed his own accomplishments as (1) a newly constructed airport, (2) the establishment of a municipal budget system, (3) modern garbage disposal, (4) a revised building code, and (5) improvements in city-owned properties.\n\nThe \"Arkansas Gazette\" (since the \"Arkansas Democrat-Gazette\", a WEHCO Media, Inc., publication) remained neutral in the mayoral campaign but instead urged the establishment of a nonpartisan city commission-manager form of government. \"We don't know what the Democratic Party or the Republican Party has to do with municipal taxation and revenue, streets, sewers, drainage, health and sanitation, parks and recreation,\" the newspaper declared. Little Rock established a nonpartisan city manager government starting in January 1958. Therefore, Remmel's election victory as a Republican cannot be duplicated in Little Rock.\n\nRemmel not only defeated Wassel: he won by a landslide, 7,794 votes (68 percent) to 3,668 (32 percent). He won all but three of the city's then twenty-six precincts. He was the first Republican to have sought the position in a quarter century. Then Democratic Governor Sid McMath attributed Remmel's victory to local factors, particularly a divisive Democratic primary between Massell and Alderman Franklin E. Loy (February 10, 1915 - February 6, 1999), also an insurance agent.\n\nThe Little Rock election caught the eye of Republican U.S. Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio who told an audience in Biloxi, Mississippi, that he hoped Remmel's victory would be \"indicative of a new trend in the South.\" In the 1952 Republican convention in Chicago, Remmel first favored a largely ceremonial choice, General Douglas MacArthur, a fellow Little Rock native whom he had hosted when the general visited the city. Delegates Remmel, his mother \"Nell\" Remmel, National Committeeman Wallace Townsend and state GOP chairman Osro Cobb all voted at the convention for Taft. The Arkansas delegation split 6-4 for Taft, and an eleventh delegate abstained. When the nomination went to Dwight D. Eisenhower, a Texas native who grew up in Kansas, Remmel worked for the national ticket, but the Adlai E. Stevenson and John J. Sparkman electors still won in Arkansas, a traditional Democratic political bastion at that time.\n\nRemmel announced that his second campaign would not accent the party issue, and the GOP declined even to offer an aldermanic slate. Remmel claimed that his record had been \"fair to all and partial to none.\" He spent some $15,000 in his second race and, in a technological innovation, linked six Little Rock radio stations to carry a simultaneous rally.\n\nIn his bid for a second term, Mayor Remmel faced the Democrat Aubrey Robert Kerr (1912-2001). The race assumed broader ramifications in that Remmel was expected to run for the United States Senate in 1954, if former Governor McMath who was defeated for renomination in the 1952 primary by Francis A. Cherry should unseat Democratic Senator John L. McClellan of Camden in the senatorial primary. Or, Remmel was seen as a possible Republican of Congress from Little Rock. The Democrats denounced Remmel as the \"silk-stocking candidate\" and the \"tool of the Republican Party.\" Such rhetoric came from Alderman Franklin Loy and Arkansas Attorney General Thomas J. Gentry, who had become hostile critics of the Remmel administration.\n\nRemmel defeated Kerr, 9,724 (59.2 percent) to 6,693 (40.8 percent). While Remmel claimed that his reelection had partisan implications because Kerr had emphasized party, state Republican Chairman Cobb said that the results merely reflected that Little Rock \"places good government ahead of party labels.\" Kerr's campaign manager, Frank H. Dodge, said, quite prematurely it turned out, that Remmel's reelection meant that \"the two-party system is now at work in Little Rock.\"\n\nA devout Christian, Remmel was a member of the board of stewards of the First United Methodist Church in Little Rock and the Methodist Men's Club. He was a former state president of the Gideons International, the men's organization which distributes Bibles in public places, such as hotel and motel rooms.\n\nOn his mayoral reelection, Remmel said that one of his objectives would be to \"help Little Rock grow more righteous.\" He addressed a high school graduating class in Corning in 1953 and urged the young people to accept the \"fundamental belief in God as the key to success.\" At a Mena civic club, Remmel warned that the United States was \"moving farther away from the Constitution and is giving up freedoms which were bought by the blood of the founders of the country.\"\n\nIn his second inaugural address, Remmel quoted from Proverbs and stressed that \"in this era of our world's history, we need to turn to God.\"\n\nIn the 1954 gubernatorial race, Remmel conceded that \"some folks have said that Remmel is too religious, but that's exactly why Remmel has a chance at all.\" While campaigning for governor, Remmel sought the prayers of ministers he met, carried his Bible in his hip pocket, and read five chapters daily.\n\nFaubus defeated Remmel, 208,121 (51.1 percent) to 172,004 (47.9 percent). The turnout was forty thousand fewer than in the Democratic runoff. Faubus polled just 16,793 more votes against Remmel than he had against Cherry. Theoretically, large numbers of Cherry supporters either stayed home in the general election or voted for Remmel. The Republican won six counties: Arkansas, Pulaski, Sebastian, Garland, Searcy, and Newton. He received at least 40 percent in five other counties, including Jefferson, Union, and Washington. He carried the cities of Fayetteville, El Dorado, and Brinkley though he lost the respective counties.\n\nFaubus recalled Remmel as \"a most gracious loser. The day following the election, he and his brother, Roland (Roland R. Remmel, September 26, 1917 - July 2, 2006), came ... to congratulate me on my victory and to wish me well. Their attitude made a strong, favorable impression on me which I never forgot.\"\n\nAmong Democrats supporting Remmel was governor was Odell Pollard, an attorney from Searcy, who switched parties himself in 1958 and later served as the GOP state chairman from 1966 to 1970.\n\nWoodrow Mann (November 13, 1916 – August 6, 2002) won the Democratic mayoral nomination over the opposition of persistent Alderman Franklin Loy, who had campaigned more against Remmel than he did against Mann by asking voters why they would even consider giving Little Rock \"a black eye\" by reelecting Remmel. Mann claimed that Remmel lacked interest in the office, had refused to allow the city attorney to oppose utility rate increases, had ignored the need for parks and playgrounds, and had failed to secure a third bridge across the Arkansas River. Remmel did not commit himself to seeking a third term until a month before the election. In retrospect, Remmel said that he should have been contented with the customary two terms and not reached beyond his grasp, but he wanted voters to have a second choice in regard to Mann, whom he considered to have an unsavory reputation in the insurance business. Remmel spent $18,000 in his losing campaign.\n\nThe third-term bid brought out the united Democratic hierarchy, including Governor Faubus, Senator James William Fulbright, and U.S. Representatives Brooks Hays, and Wilbur Daigh Mills. All urged the rejection of a two-party system. Faubus later expressed regret over his support of Mayor Mann, whom he called the \"mouthpiece\" of anti-Faubus forces in the 1957 Little Rock desegregation crisis.\n\nMann upset Remmel by 1,128 votes in a moderately close outcome. Mann polled exactly 10,000 votes (53 percent) to Remmel's 8,872 (47 percent). After his tenure as mayor, Mann relocated to Houston, where he was engaged in the life insurance business. His primary rival, Franklin Loy, also in the life insurance business, later moved to Lexington, Kentucky.\n\nThrough his mayoral tenure, Remmel was a former member of the advisory committee to the United States Conference of Mayors and a former chairman of the Arkansas Municipal League. He was once a member of the United States National Commission for the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization.\n\nIn addition to his Republican and religious affiliations, Remmel was a 32nd degree Mason, a Shriner, and a member of the American Legion, Amvets, the Sertoma Club, Optimist Club, and the United Fund. He was a former Arkansas president of the American Red Cross. He was affiliated with Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity and the Little Rock Country Club.\n\nRemmel was a board member of the Arkansas River Basin Commission and chairman of the Arkansas Waterways Commission.\n\nRemmel died in Little Rock. Services were held in his First United Methodist Church. In addition to his wife and brother Roland, Remmel was survived by a son, Pratt Remmel, Jr. (born ca. 1948); two daughters, Catherine R. \"Cathie\" Matthews (born ca. 1942) and Rebecca Couch Remmel (born ca. 1950); another brother, Augustus C.

In the US, the role is generally a requirement of US State law and is known as a registered agent, a resident agent or statutory agent. However, process agents are utilized in the US by truck drivers, brokers or freight forwarders for similar purposes. Process agents that provide nationwide coverage for motor carriers are commonly referred to as blanket companies. \n\nIn the UK, a process agent is a contractual relationship, permitted by the Civil Procedure Rules.\n\nUnder English Civil Procedure Rules, it is necessary to serve papers to start proceedings correctly. If a party does not have an address within the United Kingdom, the procedure for serving these papers can be lengthy and complicated, with proof of service particularly difficult in some circumstances. \n\nIt is therefore customary to appoint a process agent and contractually agree that service at the address of the agent will constitute proper service for the purposes of Rule 6.1.1 of the Civil Procedure Rules. In order to meet the requirements of Rule 6.1.1 an appropriate contractual clause needs to be inserted into the agreement specifying the details of the appointment.\n\nIt is also possible to appoint a Process Agent for the purposes of arbitration proceedings in a similar manner.\n\nThe role of a process agent is a vitally important service for many businesses dealing with suppliers, banks or tenders in the UK. Process agents accept service of notices, proceedings or documents on behalf of their overseas clients in situations where it is not possible for them to be served abroad. A process agent can act in a broad capacity for a company including but not limited to; acting as a process agent for court actions, receiving documents in connection with arbitration proceedings and receiving notices under contracts where an independent party is needed. \n\nA typical example of a process agency arrangement is where an overseas entity raises a loan from a city institution. Often the lending bank will require the appointment of a UK-based process agent to receive formal notices should the borrower default on the loan.\n"}

In September 2001, the Scottish Parliament rejected a negative committee report about the Bill from its Rural Development Committee and voted to support the general principles of the Bill. On 13 February 2002 the Parliament voted by eighty three to thirty six to pass the legislation to ban hunting with dogs. MSPs decided not to give compensation to those whose livelihoods or businesses might suffer as a result of the ban. The Scottish Countryside Alliance attempted to block introduction of the legislation by taking their case to the Court of Session in Edinburgh, although their appeal was not successful and in July the Judge recognised the will of the Parliament on this issue. The Act came into effect on 1 August 2002.\n\nAn article in The Guardian on 9 September 2004 reports that of the ten Scottish hunts, nine survived the ban, using the permitted exemption allowing them to use packs of hounds to flush foxes to guns (an exemption which is strongly opposed by people against hunting).\n\nA number of convictions have taken place under the Act, two for people hunting foxes and ten for hare coursing. The only prosecution of a traditional fox hunt led to a not guilty verdict, but to a clarification of the law, with the sheriff saying that the activity of flushing foxes to guns \"will require to be accompanied by realistic and one would expect, effective arrangements for the shooting of pest species. The use of what might be termed \"token guns\" or what was described by the Crown as paying lip service to the legislation is not available ... as a justification for the continuation of what was referred to in the evidence before me as traditional fox hunting.\"\n\nThere is controversy over the impact on the number of foxes killed by hunts. Hunts say that the number killed by hunts has doubled because shooting is more effective than chasing with dogs.\n\nSince the ban 2 new fox hunts have started in Scotland, the Strathappin and the Dumfriesshire and Stewartry.\n\nIn December 2015, the Scottish Government announced that a review would be held that would look at legislation dealing with hunting with dogs, with the review to be led by Lord Bonomy. In November 2016 a report was published with various recommendations, including making amendments to the law.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3438593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3438593", "title": "Right of revolution", "text": "Right of revolution\n\nIn political philosophy, the right of revolution (or right of rebellion) is the right or duty of the people of a nation to overthrow a government that acts against their common interests and/or threatens the safety of the people without cause. Stated throughout history in one form or another, the belief in this right has been used to justify various revolutions, including the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution, and the Iranian Revolution.\n\nTo justify their overthrowing of the earlier Shang Dynasty, the kings of the Zhou Dynasty (1122 – 256 BC) of China promulgated the concept known as the Mandate of Heaven, that Heaven would bless the authority of a just ruler, but would be displeased and withdraw its mandate from a despotic ruler.\n\nThe Mandate of Heaven would then transfer to those who would rule best. Chinese historians interpreted a successful revolt as evidence that the Mandate of Heaven had passed on. Throughout Chinese history, rebels who opposed the ruling dynasty made the claim that the Mandate of Heaven had passed, giving them the right to revolt. Ruling dynasties were often uncomfortable with this, and the writings of the Confucian philosopher Mencius (372 – 289 BC) were often suppressed for declaring that the people have the right to overthrow a ruler that did not provide for their needs.\n\nIn Europe, one example of the emergence of a right of revolution can be traced back to Þorgnýr the Lawspeaker, who in 1018 had a dramatic confrontation with the King of Sweden. The lawspeaker claimed the King of Sweden was accountable to the people and would be overthrown by them if he continued with his unpopular war with Norway. Another example is Magna Carta, an English charter issued in 1215, that required the King to renounce certain rights and accept that his will could be bound by the law. It included a \"security clause\" that gave the right to a committee of barons to overrule the will of the King through force if needed. Magna Carta directly influenced the development of parliamentary democracy and many constitutional documents, such as the United States Constitution.\n\nThe Golden Bull of 1222 was a golden bull, or edict, issued by King Andrew II of Hungary. The law established the rights of Hungary's noblemen, including the right to disobey the King when he acted contrary to law (\"jus resistendi\"). The Golden Bull is often compared to the Magna Carta; the Bull was the first constitutional document of the nation of Hungary, while the Magna Carta was the first constitutional charter of the nation of England.\n\nThomas Aquinas also wrote of the right to resist tyrannical rule in the Summa Theologica. John of Salisbury advocated direct revolutionary assassination of unethical tyrannical rulers in his \"Policraticus\". This theological notion was expanded in the Early Modern Period. The Jesuits, especially Robert Bellarmine and Juan de Mariana, were widely known and often feared for advocating resistance to tyranny and often tyrannicide—one of the implications of the natural law focus of the School of Salamanca.\n\nJohn Calvin believed something similar. In a commentary on the Book of Daniel, he observed that contemporary monarchs pretend to reign “by the grace of God,” but the pretense was “a mere cheat” so that they could “reign without control.” He believed that “Earthly princes depose themselves while they rise up against God,” so “it behooves us to spit upon their heads than to obey them.” When ordinary citizens are confronted with tyranny, he wrote, ordinary citizens have to suffer it. But magistrates have the duty to “curb the tyranny of kings,” as had the Tribunes in ancient Rome, the Ephori in Sparta, and the Demarchs in ancient Athens. That Calvin could support a right of resistance in theory did not mean that he thought such resistance prudent in all circumstances. At least publicly, he disagreed with the Scottish Calvinist John Knox’s call for revolution against the Catholic Queen Mary I Tudor of England.\n\nThe Catholic Church shared Calvin's prudential concerns - the Pope condemned Guy Fawkes' Gunpowder Plot, and \"Regnans in Excelsis\" was widely considered to be a mistake. Instead, the safest course of action for the people was to endure tyranny for as long as it could be borne, rather than run the larger risks of armed revolution.\n\nThe right of revolution was expounded by the Monarchomachs in the context of the French Wars of Religion, and by Huguenots thinkers who legitimized tyrannicides.\n\nThe concept of the right of revolution was developed at the beginning of the Enlightenment era in the work \"Two Treatises of Government\". Written by the philosopher John Locke, the right to revolution formed an integral part of his social contract theory, in which he tried to define the origins and basis for social conditions and relationships. Locke declared that under natural law, all people have the right to life, liberty, and estate; under the social contract, the people could instigate a revolution against the government when it acted against the interests of citizens, to replace the government with one that served the interests of citizens. In some cases, Locke deemed revolution an obligation. The right of revolution thus essentially acted as a safeguard against tyranny.\n\nLocke affirmed an explicit right to revolution in \"Two Treatises of Government\": “\"whenever the Legislators endeavor to take away, and destroy the Property of the People\", or to reduce them to Slavery under Arbitrary Power, they put themselves into a state of War with the People, who are thereupon absolved from any farther Obedience, and are left to the common Refuge, which God hath provided for all Men, against Force and Violence. Whensoever therefore the \"Legislative\" shall transgress this fundamental Rule of Society; and either by Ambition, Fear, Folly or Corruption, \"endeavor to grasp\" themselves, \"or put into the hands of any other an Absolute Power\" over the Lives, Liberties, and Estates of the People; By this breach of Trust \"they forfeit the Power\", the People had put into their hands, for quite contrary ends, and it devolves to the People, who have a Right to resume their original Liberty.”\n\nRevolutionary movements subsequent to this, all drew on Locke's theory as a justification for the exercise of the right of revolution.\n\nDuring the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the Parliament of England effectively deposed James II of England and replaced him with William III of Orange-Nassau, due to the former's unacceptable leanings towards absolutism and Catholicism. Although Locke's treatise was published the year after, his ideas were already widely current in the English political system at the time.\nAlthough Locke claimed that his book's purpose was to justify William III's ascension to the throne, it has been argued that the bulk of the writing was instead completed between 1679–1680 during the Exclusion Crisis, which attempted to prevent James II from ever taking the throne in the first place. Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, Locke's mentor, patron and friend, introduced the bill, but it was ultimately unsuccessful. Alternatively, the work is better associated with the revolutionary conspiracies that swirled around what would come to be known as the Rye House Plot.\n\nThe right to revolution played a large part in the writings of the American revolutionaries in the run up to the American Revolution. The political tract \"Common Sense\" used the concept as an argument for rejection of the British Monarchy and separation from the British Empire, as opposed to merely self-government within it. It was also cited in the Declaration of Independence of the United States, when a group of representatives from the various states signed a declaration of independence citing charges against King George III. As the American Declaration of Independence in 1776 expressed it, natural law taught that the people were “endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights” and could alter or abolish government “destructive” of those rights.\n\nThe right of revolution was also included in the 1793 preface to the French Constitution of 1793 during the French Revolution. This preface from 24 June 1793 contained a declaration of the rights of man and citizen including right to rebellion in §35: \"When the government violates the rights of the people, insurrection is for the people, and for every portion thereof, the most sacred of rights and the most indispensable of duties.\"\n\nAlthough some explanations of the right of revolution leave open the possibility of its exercise as an individual right, it was clearly understood to be a collective right under English constitutional and political theory.\n\nAs Pauline Maier has noted in her study \"From Resistance to Revolution\", “private individuals were forbidden to take force against their rulers either for malice or because of private injuries...” Instead, “not just a few individuals, but the ‘Body of the People’ had to feel concerned” before the right of revolution was justified and with most writers speaking of a “ ‘whole people who are the Public,’ or the body of the people acting in their ‘public Authority,’ indicating a broad consensus involving all ranks of society.”\n\nSome philosophers argue that it is not only the right of a people to overthrow an oppressive government but also their \"duty\" to do so. Howard Evans Kiefer opines, \"It seems to me that the \"duty\" to rebel is much more understandable than that \"right\" to rebel, because the right to rebellion ruins the order of power, whereas the duty to rebel goes beyond and breaks it.\"\n\nMorton White writes of the American revolutionaries, \"The notion that they had a \"duty\" to rebel is extremely important to stress, for it shows that they thought they were complying with the \"commands\" of natural law and of nature's God when they threw off absolute despotism.\" The U.S. Declaration of Independence states that \"when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their \"duty\", to throw off such Government\" (emphasis added). The phrase \"long train of abuses\" is a reference to John Locke's similar statement in Second Treatise of Government, where he explicitly established overthrow of a tyrant as an obligation. Martin Luther King likewise held that it is the duty of the people to resist unjust laws.\n\nSome theories of the right of revolution imposed significant preconditions on its exercise, limiting its invocation to the most dire circumstances. In the American Revolutionary context, one finds expressions of the right of revolution both as subject to precondition and as unrestrained by conditions.\n\nOn the eve of the American Revolution, for example, Americans considered their plight to justify exercise of the right of revolution. Alexander Hamilton justified American resistance as an expression of “the law of nature” redressing violations of “the first principles of civil society” and invasions of “the rights of a whole people.” For Thomas Jefferson the Declaration was the last-ditch effort of an oppressed people—the position in which many Americans saw themselves in 1776. Jefferson’s litany of colonial grievances was an effort to establish that Americans met their burden to exercise the natural law right of revolution.\n\nCertain scholars, such as legal historian Christian Fritz, have written that with the end of the Revolution, Americans did not renounce the right of revolution. In fact they codified it in their new constitutions and even today 35 constitutions of American states have the same or similar provisions on the right of revolution as in the preamble of the American Declaration of Independence. For instance, constitutions considered to be \"conservative,\" such as those of post-revolutionary Massachusetts in 1780, preserved the people's right \"to reform, alter, or totally change\" government not only for their protection or safety but also whenever their \"prosperity and happiness reduire[d] it.\" This expression was not unusual in the early American constitutions. Connecticut's 1818 constitution articulated the people's right \"at all times\" to alter government \"in such a manner as they may think expedient.\"\n\nFritz, in \"American Sovereigns: The People and America's Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War\", describes a duality in American views on preconditions to the right of revolution: \"Some of the first state constitutions included 'alter or abolish' provisions that mirrored the traditional right of revolution\" in that they required dire preconditions to its exercise. Maryland's 1776 constitution and New Hampshire's 1784 constitutions required the perversion of the ends of government and the endangering of public liberty and that all other means of redress were to no avail. But in contrast, other states dispensed with the onerous preconditions on the exercise of the right. In the 1776 Virginia constitution the right would arise simply if government was \"inadequate\" and Pennsylvania's 1776 constitution required only that the people considered a change to be \"most conducive\" to the public welfare.\n\nDescriptions of the Right of Revolution also differ in whether that right is considered to be a natural law (a law whose content is set by nature and that therefore has validity everywhere) or positive law (law enacted or adopted by proper authority for governing of the state).\n\nAn example of the dual nature of the right of revolution as both a natural law and as positive law is found in the American revolutionary context. Although the American Declaration of Independence invoked the natural law right of revolution, natural law was not the sole justification for American independence. English constitutional doctrine also supported the colonists’ actions, at least up to a point. By the 1760s, English law recognized what William Blackstone’s \"Commentaries on the Laws of England\" called “the law of redress against public oppression.” Like the natural law’s right of revolution, this constitutional law of redress justified the people resisting the sovereign. This law of redress arose from a contract between the people and the king to preserve the public welfare. This original contract was “a central dogma in English and British constitutional law” since “time immemorial.” The Declaration’s long list of grievances declared that this bargain had been breached.\n\nThis well-accepted law of redress justified a people resisting unconstitutional acts of government. Liberty depended upon the people’s “ultimate” right to resist. Unconstitutional commands breaching the “voluntary compact between the rulers and the ruled” could be “ignored” and arbitrary commands opposed with force. This right implied a duty on the part of the people to resist unconstitutional acts. As Alexander Hamilton noted in 1775, government exercised powers to protect “the absolute rights” of the people and government forfeited those powers and the people could reclaim them if government breached this constitutional contract.\n\nThe law of redress had limits like the right of revolution under natural law. The law of redress, like the right of revolution, was not an individual right. It belonged to the community as a whole, as one of the parties to the original constitutional contract. It was not a means of first resort, or response to trivial or casual errors of government. Blackstone’s \"Commentaries\" suggested that using the law of redress would be “extraordinary,” for example applying if the king broke the original contract, violated “the fundamental laws,” or abandoned the kingdom. During the Stamp Act crisis of the 1760s the Massachusetts Provincial Congress considered resistance to the king justified if freedom came under attack from “the hand of oppression” and “the merciless feet of tyranny.” A decade later the “indictment” of George III in the Declaration of Independence sought to end his sovereign reign over the colonies because he violated the original constitutional contract.\n\nAs explained in legal historian Christian Fritz’s description of the role of the right of revolution in American Revolution, American independence was justified by conventional theories under Anglo-American constitutional thought at the time about the people’s collective right to cast off an arbitrary king. “Both natural law and English constitutional doctrine gave the colonists a right to revolt against the sovereign’s oppression.” But these understandings about the right of revolution on the eve of the American Revolution rested on a traditional model of government. That model posited the existence of a hypothetical bargain struck in the mists of antiquity between a king and a people. “In this bargain, the people were protected by the monarch in exchange for the people giving the king allegiance. This was a contractual relationship. American revolutionaries accused George III of breaching his implied duty of protection under that contract, thereby releasing the people in the colonies from their allegiance. The sovereign’s breach of the hypothetical contract gave rise to the subjects’ right of revolution”—grounded on both natural law and English constitutional doctrine.”\n\nAlthough many declarations of independence seek legitimacy by appealing to the right of revolution, far fewer constitutions mention this right or guarantee this right to citizens because of the destabilizing effect such a guarantee would likely produce. Among the examples of an articulation of a right of revolution as positive law include:\n\n\nSome have argued that because in modern times democratic governments can be overthrown by popular vote, the right of the people to remove the government has become embedded into the political system. In a study of the idea of rule by the people in the American Revolution and in early post-revolutionary America, legal historian Christian G. Fritz writes:\n\n“The constitutional logic of recognizing the people, not a king, as the sovereign implied the irrelevance of a right of revolution in America. This did not develop instantly or uniformly after the establishment of American governments. Some of the first state constitutions included ‘alter or abolish’ provisions that mirrored the traditional right of revolution... Other state constitutions adopted different versions of this right to ‘alter or abolish’ government that did not sound like the traditional right of revolution. In these provisions, the ability of the people to revise constitutions existed regardless of the traditional preconditions for the right of revolution... Increasingly, as Americans included it in their constitutions, the right of revolution came to be seen as a constitutional principle permitting the people as the sovereign to control government and revise their constitutions without limit. In this way, the right broke loose from its traditional moorings of resistance to oppression. The alter or abolish provisions could now be interpreted consistent with the constitutional principle that in America, the sovereign was the people.”\nHowever, the Arab Spring is clear evidence that revolutions are still happening, which raises the importance of the right of revolution in 21st century. As terrorism is gaining recognition as a crime under international law, the right of revolution is seen as an instrument to distinguish terrorists from freedom fighters.\n\n\n\n"}

SANZAAR meets annually and is composed of the CEOs from its member unions.\n\nIt was formed as SANZAR in 1996 as a joint venture of the South African Rugby Union, the New Zealand Rugby Union and the Australian Rugby Union. From the 2016 season, its name was changed to SANZAAR following the inclusion of the Argentine Rugby Union as a full member of the organisation.\n\nSANZAR was formed in 1995, shortly after rugby's move to professionalism, to counter the threat of Australia's Super League, a new rugby league competition that offered large salaries to players.\n\nSANZAR proposed the Super 12, an annual provincial competition with teams from all three countries, and the Tri Nations Series, an annual competition between each country's Test teams. This concept was developed by Queensland Rugby Union CEO Terry Doyle, New South Wales Rugby Union CEO David Moffett and Australian Rugby Union CEO Bruce Hayman. Rian Oberholzer was the first CEO of SANZAR.\n\nSANZAR's proposals were under serious threat from the World Rugby Corporation (WRC), a company formed by lawyer Geoff Levy and former Wallaby player Ross Turnbull. Both wanted a professional worldwide rugby competition funded by Kerry Packer, who had already developed professional cricket. At one point the WRC had a majority of the All Blacks and Wallaby teams signed up to their competition. However, the South African Rugby Union told the Springboks players that they would never play for their country again if they committed to the WRC, and they remained with the SARU. Most of the All Blacks then followed them, and finally the Wallabies did too.\n\nTo fund the competitions, SANZAR looked to News Limited, who was the Super League's broadcaster, eventually being offered $555 million over 10 years for worldwide television rights.\n\nIn 2002, a proposal to expand the Super 12 to fourteen teams, supported by Australia and South Africa, was vetoed by the New Zealand Rugby Union. This led to calls for the Australian and South African teams to withdraw from the competition, but the partnership continued and the issue was revisited before the end of the original 10-year broadcasting deal.\n\nFor the 2006 season, SANZAR agreed to expand the Super 12 competition with two new teams and to increase the number of Test matches played in the Tri-Nations. Licences were granted for franchises based in Bloemfontein and Perth, creating the Cheetahs and Western Force teams for the expanded Super 14 competition.\n\nThe SANZAR partnership was tested in 2007 after New Zealand removed its top 22 players from the Super 14 competition, and South Africa's removal of players from the Tri-Nations prompted calls for the Australian Rugby Union to cancel future matches against the Springboks.\n\nIn 2009 there emerged concerns that South African Rugby Union might opt to break away from the alliance over a dispute about the proposed plan to expand Super Rugby to fifteen teams in 2011, voicing its support for the concept generally but disagreeing over its length and format. On 6 May 2009, however, ARU Chief Executive John O'Neill warned that the South Africans would be the real losers, missing out altogether and potentially losing players if they went ahead with the split. \"The joint venture must remain intact\", he urged. \"I have dealt with the South Africans for years in business and sport. Part of their DNA is to take it to the brink. There's a moment when they will realise they have taken it far enough.\" On 20 May 2009, SANZAR announced it had reached agreement on a new deal involving all three nations beginning in the 2011 season.\n\nThe deal for 2011 to 2015 included:\n\nFurther expansion was agreed in 2015 to include the Argentine Rugby Union as a full member of SANZAAR from 2016. Three additional teams were included in the Super Rugby competition, one each from South Africa, Argentina and Japan. Two regional groupings were formed: the Australasian Group, with five teams in the Australian Conference and five teams in the New Zealand Conference and the South African Group, with six South African teams, one Argentinean team and one Japanese team split into a four-team Africa 1 Conference a four-team Africa 2 Conference.\n\nWhile a Japanese team has been invited to participate in the Super Rugby competition from 2016, Japan is not a member of SANZAAR at this stage.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "315952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=315952", "title": "Technology transfer", "text": "Technology transfer\n\nTechnology transfer, also called transfer of technology (TOT), is the process of transferring (disseminating) technology from the places and ingroups of its origination to wider distribution among more people and places. It occurs along various axes: among universities, from universities to businesses, from large businesses to smaller ones, from governments to businesses, across borders, both formally and informally, and both openly and surreptitiously. Often it occurs by concerted effort to share skills, knowledge, technologies, methods of manufacturing, samples of manufacturing, and facilities among governments or universities and other institutions to ensure that scientific and technological developments are accessible to a wider range of users who can then further develop and exploit the technology into new products, processes, applications, materials, or services. It is closely related to (and may arguably be considered a subset of) knowledge transfer. Horizontal transfer is the movement of technologies from one area to another. At present transfer of technology (TOT) is primarily horizontal. Vertical transfer occurs when technologies are moved from applied research centers to research and development departments.\n\nTechnology transfer is promoted at conferences organized by such groups as the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation and the Association of University Technology Managers, and at \"challenge\" competitions by organizations such as the Center for Advancing Innovation in Maryland. Local venture capital organizations such as the Mid-Atlantic Venture Association (MAVA) also sponsor conferences at which investors assess the potential for commercialization of technology.\n\nTechnology brokers are people who discovered how to bridge the emergent worlds and apply scientific concepts or processes to new situations or circumstances. A related term, used almost synonymously, is \"technology valorisation\". While conceptually the practice has been utilized for many years (in ancient times, Archimedes was notable for applying science to practical problems), the present-day volume of research, combined with high-profile failures at Xerox PARC and elsewhere, has led to a focus on the process itself.\n\nWhereas technology transfer can involve the dissemination of highly complex technology from capital-intensive origins to low-capital recipients (and can involve aspects of dependency and fragility of systems), it also can involve appropriate technology, not necessarily high-tech or expensive, that is better disseminated, yielding robustness and independence of systems.\n\nMany companies, universities and governmental organizations now have an Office of Technology Transfer (TTO, also known as \"Tech Transfer\" or \"TechXfer\") dedicated to identifying research which has potential commercial interest and strategies for how to exploit it. For instance, a research result may be of scientific and commercial interest, but patents are normally only issued for practical processes, and so someone—not necessarily the researchers—must come up with a specific practical process. Another consideration is commercial value; for example, while there are many ways to accomplish nuclear fusion, the ones of commercial value are those that generate more energy than they require to operate.\n\nThe process to commercially exploit research varies widely. It can involve licensing agreements or setting up joint ventures and partnerships to share both the risks and rewards of bringing new technologies to market. Other corporate vehicles, e.g. spin-outs, are used where the host organization does not have the necessary will, resources or skills to develop a new technology. Often these approaches are associated with raising of venture capital (VC) as a means of funding the development process, a practice more common in the United States than in the European Union, which has a more conservative approach to VC funding. Research spin-off companies are a popular vehicle of commercialisation in Canada, where the rate of licensing of Canadian university research remains far below that of the US.\n\nTechnology transfer offices may work on behalf of research institutions, governments and even large multinationals. Where start-ups and spin-outs are the clients, commercial fees are sometimes waived in lieu of an equity stake in the business. As a result of the potential complexity of the technology transfer process, technology transfer organizations are often multidisciplinary, including economists, engineers, lawyers, marketers and scientists. The dynamics of the technology transfer process has attracted attention in its own right, and there are several dedicated societies and journals.\n\nThere has been a marked increase in technology transfer intermediaries specialized in their field since 1980, stimulated in large part by the Bayh-Dole Act and equivalent legislation in other countries, which provided additional incentives for research exploitation.\n\nDespite incentives to move research into production, the practical aspects are sometimes difficult to perform in practice. Using DoD Technology Readiness Levels as a criterion (for example), research tends to focus on TRL (technology readiness level) 1–3 while readiness for production tends to focus on TRL 6–7 or higher. Bridging TRL-3 to TRL-6 has proven to be difficult in some organizations. Attempting to rush research (prototypes) into production (fully tested under diverse conditions, reliable, maintainable, etc.) tends to be more costly and time-consuming than expected.\n\n"}

In this sense, it is the common heritage of humanity and should be recognized and affirmed for the benefit of present and future generations.\" Article 4 describes that cultural diversity may not infringe upon human rights guaranteed by international law. Article 5 affirms linguistic rights as cultural rights in accordance with International Bill of Human Rights. Article 6 affirms the freedom of expression, media pluralism and multilingualism. And Article 12 defines on the role of the UNESCO.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "17297840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17297840", "title": "United States criminal procedure", "text": "United States criminal procedure\n\nUnited States criminal procedure derives from several sources of law: the baseline protections of the United States Constitution, federal and state statutes; federal and state rules of criminal procedure (such as the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure); and state and federal case law. Criminal procedures are distinct from civil procedures in the US.\n\nThe United States Constitution, including the United States Bill of Rights and subsequent amendments, contains the following provisions regarding criminal procedure. Due to the incorporation of the Bill of Rights, all of these provisions apply equally to criminal proceedings in state courts, with the exception of the Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Vicinage Clause of the Sixth Amendment, and (maybe) the Excessive Bail Clause of the Eighth Amendment.\n\nFederal statutes and rules apply to criminal proceedings in federal courts, such as:\n\nEach state has its own statutes and rules of criminal proceeding applying to proceedings in its courts.\n\nIn a criminal case, the government generally brings charges in one of two ways: either by accusing a suspect directly in a \"bill of information\" or other similar document, or by bringing evidence before a grand jury to allow that body to determine whether the case should proceed. If the grand jury determines that there is enough evidence to justify the bringing of charges, then the defendant is indicted. In the federal system, a case must always be brought before a grand jury for indictment if it is punishable by death or more than one year in prison; some states, however, do not require indictment.\n\nOnce charges have been brought, the case is then brought before a petit jury, (or what is commonly recognized as the normal courtroom jury of six to twelve members), or is tried by a judge alone, if the defense requests it. Any petit jury is selected from a pool by the prosecution and defense.\n\nAfter both sides have presented their cases and made closing arguments, the judge gives the jury legal instructions; the jury then adjourns to deliberate in private. The jury generally must unanimously agree on a verdict of guilty or not guilty; however, the Supreme Court has upheld non unanimous jury verdicts, so long as the jury is larger than 6 people. In 1972, the Court upheld convictions in Apodaca v. Oregon and Johnson v. Louisiana where Oregon and Louisiana convicted Petitioners on 10-to-2 and 9-to-3 verdicts respectively. In 1979, the Court ruled in Burch v. Louisiana that where a jury was made of 6 people, the verdict must be unanimous.\n\nThe prosecution gives an opening statement that summarizes its general arguments. The defense can then present its opening statement or may opt to wait until the prosecution has finished presenting its complete case. The prosecution presents its case first. This is done by calling witnesses to give testimony and by presenting physical evidence that will prove the defendant is guilty of the crime. Witnesses are people who can give testimony that will help prove the guilt of the defendant. They may have actually seen events related to the crime, may have relevant information about the defendant, or may be able to give expert testimony concerning the evidence or have other important information. After the prosecution finishes, it is the time for the defense to address the court. \n\nThe defense may start by asking the judge to dismiss the case for lack of evidence. If the judge agrees the evidence is insufficient to prove the defendant committed the crime without a reasonable doubt, the case will be dismissed and the defendant will be free of the charges. Usually, the judge does not dismiss the case. At this time, the defense will give its opening statement if it has not already done so. The defense then proceeds to present its case by calling witnesses and submitting evidence that will prove the defendant did not commit the crime. All witnesses may be cross-examined by the opposing side while testifying. Under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the defendant is not required to be a witness in his own defense. If he does not testify, the jury can not hold this against him. Also under the Fifth Amendment, a witness has the right not to incriminate himself. This means the witness is not required to answer any question if doing so would incriminate himself. After the defense finishes presenting its case, each side gives a closing statement summarizing the evidence that supports its position of either guilt or innocence. The closing statements are given in the same order, with the defense going last. Then the deliberation phase of the trail begins.\n\nThe burden of proof is on the prosecution in a criminal trial. This means the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of the crime. As the defense does not have this burden, it must only prove that it is reasonably possible that the defendant did not commit the crime. The defense does not have to prove the defendant definitely did not commit the crime, only that it is possible he did not do it.\n\nOnce the prosecution and defense present their cases, the judge will give the case to the jury. First the judge will instruct the jury about any legal rules that may affect their decision. The judge then sends the jury to the jury room to deliberate about whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty of the charges. During the trial the jury is not allowed to read about the case or discuss it with anyone even each other. Sometimes juries are sequestered or kept together away from their homes and any media coverage of the trial. \n\nOnce deliberation begins the jurors are allowed to talk to each other. They are to remain together, except overnight, until they either reach a decision or determine they cannot reach a decision. In the later occurrence, the jury is said to be deadlocked and is called a hung jury. If the jury decides, this is called the verdict. They inform the judge and return to the courtroom where the verdict is read. The judge may either accept the verdict or overrule it. It is rare for the verdict to be overruled. This happens when the judge thinks the verdict is unlawful. Often this is because the jury does not follow the legal instructions. It can also happen if the judge thinks the jury interpreted the evidence in a manner that was not legal. Once the verdict is determined, the trial moves to the punishment phase. This can simply be the judge issuing the punishment sentence or, in more serious cases, can involve a separate hearing.\n\nIf a defendant is found guilty, sentencing follows, often at a separate hearing after the prosecution, defense, and court have developed information based on which the judge will craft a sentence. The United States Sentencing Commission has promulgated guidance on what restitution and prison terms should be assessed for different crimes. In capital cases, a separate \"penalty phase\" occurs, in which the jury determines whether to recommend that the death penalty should be imposed. As with the determination of guilt phase, the burden is on the prosecution to prove its case, and the defendant is entitled to take the stand in his or her own defense, and may call witnesses and present evidence.\n\nAfter sentencing, the case enters the post conviction phase. Usually the defendant begins serving the sentence immediately after the sentence is issued. The defendant may appeal the outcome of his trial to a higher court. American appellate courts do not retry the case. These courts only examine the record of the proceedings of the lower court to determine if errors were made that require a new trial, resentencing, or a complete dismissal of the charges. The prosecution may not appeal after an acquittal, although it may appeal under limited circumstances before the verdict is rendered. The prosecution may also appeal the sentence itself. Increasingly, there is also a recognition that collateral consequences of criminal charges may result from the sentence that are not explicitly part of the sentence itself.\n\n"}
