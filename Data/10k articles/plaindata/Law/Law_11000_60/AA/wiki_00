In 2005 Allahabad High Court quashed Aligarh Muslim University Amendment Act, 1981, was unconstitutional and that the AMU was not a minority institution and, therefore, the notification issued by the Human Resource Development Ministry on February, permitting the university to reserve seats for Muslims in post-graduate medical courses was illegal.\n\nThe Act is more or less into lime because of the debate on whether the Aligarh Muslim University was a minority status or not?

The AAA also administers mediation through Mediation.org and other forms of alternative dispute resolution. It is headquartered in New York City, with regional offices in Atlanta, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, East Providence, Rhode Island, Fresno, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis, New York City, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Antonio, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, Somerset, New Jersey and Washington, DC.\n\nThe International Centre for Dispute Resolution (ICDR), established in 1996 by the AAA, administers international arbitration proceedings initiated under the institution's rules. ICDR currently () has offices in New York City, Mexico City, Singapore, and Bahrain.\n\nThe AAA provides services and online tools for Employer's General Counsel to create contracts of adhesion during all stages of hiring, employment, and post-employment favorable to those clients. They provide information demonstrating economic incentive for their Corporate clients to do so. They provide no information whatsoever for those to be brought under those contracts of adhesion. At the time of dispute they administer the selection of \"neutral\" arbitrators. They provide further information regarding the possibly legal destruction of documents and minimum retention of mandatory records according the \"Sedona Principles\" of eDiscovery.\n\nThe AAA was founded in 1926 by the merger of the Arbitration Society of America and the Arbitration Foundation to provide dispute resolution and avoid Civil Court proceedings.\n\nMany contracts include an arbitration clause naming the AAA as the organization that will administer arbitration between the parties. The AAA does not itself arbitrate disputes, but provides administrative support to arbitrations before a single arbitrator or a panel of three arbitrators. The arbitrators are chosen in accordance with the parties' agreement or, if the parties do not agree otherwise, in accordance with the AAA rules. Under its rules, the AAA may appoint an arbitrator in some circumstances, for example, where the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator or a party fails to exercise its right to appoint an arbitrator.\n\nThe AAA role in the dispute resolution process is to administer cases, from filing to closing. The AAA provides administrative services in the U.S., as well as abroad through the ICDR. The AAA's and ICDR's administrative services include assisting in the appointment of mediators and arbitrators, setting hearings, conducting cases under the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Arbitration Rules, and providing users with information on dispute resolution options, including settlement through mediation. Ultimately, the AAA aims to move cases through arbitration or mediation in a fair and impartial manner until completion.\n\nAdditional AAA services include the design and development of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) systems for corporations, unions, government agencies, law firms, and the courts. The Association also provides elections services as well as education, training, and publications for those seeking an understanding of alternative dispute resolution.\n\nIn July 2009, the AAA stopped accepting consumer debt collection cases, after the National Arbitration Forum was forced to do so after questions arose about the fairness of its process.\n\nIn April 2013, the New York State Department of Financial Services hired the AAA to host mediation sessions between insurance companies and Hurricane Sandy victims.\n\nThe AAA has actively promoted the use of mediation around the world, including through its participation as a co-founder in 2007 and current board member of the Netherlands-based International Mediation Institute.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5847461", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5847461", "title": "Asset freezing", "text": "Asset freezing\n\nAsset freezing is a legal process which prevents a defendant (usually an apparent fraudster) to an action from dissipating their assets from beyond the jurisdiction of a court so as to frustrate a potential judgment. It is widely recognised in other common law jurisdictions and such orders can be made to have world-wide effect. It is variously construed as part of a court's inherent jurisdiction to restrain breaches of its process.\n\nThe jurisdiction arises in part from the Judicature Act 1873, which provided that \"A mandamus or an injunction may be granted or a receiver appointed by an interlocutory Order of the Court in all cases in which it shall appear to the Court to be just or convenient...\" Relying on this, Jessel MR in 1878 declared, \"I have unlimited power to grant an injunction in any case where it would be right or just to do so...\"\n\nThe legal order itself is in the form of an injunction, which in Commonwealth jurisdictions is also known as a freezing order, Mareva injunction, Mareva order or Mareva regime, after the case \"Mareva Compania Naviera SA v International Bulkcarriers SA\", although the first recorded instance of such an order in English jurisprudence was \"Nippon Yusen Kaisha v Karageorgis\", decided one month before \"Mareva\". The \"Civil Procedure Rules 1998\" now define a Mareva injunction as a \"freezing order\".\n\nAsset freezing is not a security, nor a means to pressure a judgment debtor, nor is it a type of asset forfeiture since it does not confer upon anyone else a proprietary interest in the defendant's assets. However, some authorities have treated the Mareva injunction as an order to stop a judgment debtor from dissipating his assets so as to have the effect of frustrating judgment, rather than the more strenuous test of requiring an intent to abuse court procedure. An example of the former would be paying off a legitimate debt, whereas an example of the latter would be hiding the assets in overseas banks on receiving notice of the action.\n\nA freezing order will usually only be made where the claimant can show that there was at least a good arguable case that they would succeed at trial and that the refusal of an injunction would involve a real risk that a judgment or award in their favour would remain unsatisfied. It is recognised as being quite harsh on defendants because the order is often granted at the pre-trial stage in \"ex parte\" hearings, based on affidavit evidence alone.\n\nA Mareva injunction is often combined with an Anton Piller order in these circumstances. This can be disastrous for a defendant as the cumulative effect of these orders can be to destroy the whole of a business' custom by freezing most of its assets and revealing important information to its competitors, and the two orders have been described by Lord Donaldson as being the law's \"nuclear weapons.\"\n\nWhile it is not advisable to obtain such an order on purely strategic grounds, asset freezing has a persuasive effect on settlement negotiations. While a claimant obtaining an order can expect to face subsequent opposition in court from the defendant, the freezing order is generally considered to be the beginning of the end for the defendant, and negotiation and settlement avoid the return to court.\n\nCurrent orders issued by the court do not generally call for a blanket freezing of assets, and they are currently worded in more nuanced terms according to the situation concerned.\n\nThe process is regarded as a high-stakes exercise for several reasons:\n\n\nSimilar provision can be found in the exercise of:\n\nIt has been extended to other members of the European Union, by virtue of Article 9(2) of the \"Directive on the enforcement of intellectual property rights\". Since January 2017, a uniform European Account Preservation Order has been implemented in all EU member States (other than Denmark and the United Kingdom).\n\n\"Mareva\" was rejected by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1999 in \"Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo, S.A. v. Alliance Bond Fund, Inc\". For the majority, Justice Scalia held that, as such jurisdiction did not exist at the time of the passage of the Judiciary Act of 1789, the federal courts had no authority to exercise it. In dissent, Justice Ginsburg asserted that the federal courts' exercise of its equity jurisdiction was never that static. While \"Grupo Mexicano\" is consistent with other Supreme Court jurisprudence in the matter of preliminary injunctions, there has been debate as to whether this decision should be reversed.\n\nAt the state level, the New York Court of Appeals reached a similar conclusion to that of the Supreme Court in 2000, in \"Credit Agricole v. Rossiyskiy\".\n\nIn place of \"Mareva\", US civil jurisprudence relies more on prejudgment writs of attachment, preliminary injunctions and temporary restraining orders, which have a more limited scope of application.\n\nAlthough it is mistakenly believed that a freezing injunction provides security over the defendant’s assets for a possible judgment, or secures a judgment already obtained, Lord Donaldson MR explained in \"Polly Peck International Plc v Nadir\" that such is not the case:\n\nIn 2007, Lord Bingham declared:\n\nIn \"Group Seven\", Hildyard J outlined the current scope of freezing orders that can be issued by the Court:\n\n\nIn 2014, \"Lakatamia\" emphasized that the assets of a company wholly owned by a person subject to a freezing order are not automatically subject to the order. In that case, Rimer J noted:\n\nHowever, the person's shares in the company are subject to it, and any conduct by him (not in the course of ordinary business) that diminishes the value of those shares will infringe that order.\n\nSubsequent jurisprudence has extended the reach of freezing orders to third parties against whom there is no substantive cause of action, but where there is good reason to suppose that their assets may in truth be the assets of the defendant against whom a cause of action is asserted. This type of order is known as \"Chabra\" relief, and has been described as possessing certain characteristics:\n\n\nDepending on the circumstances, alternative types of orders may be more attractive to an applicant:\n\n\nA \"third party debt order\" (which consists of an interim freezing order and a final order requiring the third party to pay the debt to the judgment creditor) is available to secure payment of county court judgments.\n\nInformal \"de facto\" freezing may also be undertaken in most common law jurisdictions by a third-party guardian or assetholder, where he has been informed that those assets are imposed with a constructive trust in favour of someone other than the apparent owner. The freeze may be effected by issuing a letter to the asset holder or guardian in question, informing them of the true origin or beneficial ownership of the targeted funds or assets, and advising them of their potential accessory civil and possible criminal liability in the event of any transfer or disposal of the assets in question. Such devices may be employed in cases where a victim of fraud suspects that targeted funds or assets may be transferred to another location where it might be impractical to gain access to them. However, the use of this technique within the United States is not generally accepted.\n\n"}

Under the Constitution of the British Virgin Islands the Attorney General sits \"ex officio\" in both the House of Assembly of the British Virgin Islands and in the Cabinet of the British Virgin Islands, but is not permitted to vote in either. The Attorney General also sits on the Committee for the Prerogative of Mercy and on the National Security Council.\n\nThe office traces its origins back to the reintroduction of democracy in the British Virgin Islands pursuant to the 1950 general election. At that time the Legislative Council (as the House of Assembly was then known) had to look to the Attorney General of the Leeward Islands for support. This was regarded as unsatisfactory and following the 1954 general election Herman Besson was appointed to the title of Legal Assistant to the Legislative Council. In 1959 the title of the office was changed to Crown Attorney, and subsequent to the introduction of Ministerial Government following the 1967 general election the office was titled Attorney General.\n\nThe Attorney General is supported by two senior law officers: the Solicitor General (in relation to civil matters) and the Director of Public Prosecutions (in relation to criminal matters).\n\nWhen appearing in court, by convention the Attorney General sits one row in from the row reserved for Queen's Counsel.\n\nThe current Attorney General is Baba Aziz. Mr Aziz also formerly served as acting Attorney General for over a year between 24 June 2010 and 6 November 2011.\n\nSince 2007 in order to be qualified to be appointed as Attorney General a person must be eligible to be admitted as a lawyer in the British Virgin Islands, and must have not less than 10 years experience practising law. However, this was not always the case, and various past Attorneys General were either not admitted in the British Virgin Islands and in some cases were not even eligible to be admitted in the British Virgin Islands.\n\nBy law, since 2007 no person may be appointed to the office of Attorney General unless he or she is a Belonger to the Virgin Islands unless, in the opinion of the Judicial and Legal Services Commission, there is no such person who is suitably qualified and able and willing to be so appointed. In practice, every single Attorney General appointed since 2007 has been a non-Belonger, and only one Attorney General in the history of the British Virgin Islands was a belonger at the time they were appointed (Dancia Penn).\n\nA total of 26 persons have been appointed to the office (including as Crown Attorney or Legal Assistant prior to 1967, and persons who were appointed as acting Attorney General), of whom 20 have been men and six have been women. Three have been Queen's Counsel (although two were appointed to the rank during office), and the remaining 23 have been from the Outer bar or solicitors during their time as Attorney General. The longest serving Attorney General to date has been Cherno Jallow, who served just under eight years (including time as acting Attorney General).\n\nFor Attorneys General prior to 1954 see Attorney General of the Leeward Islands\n\n"}

As a result, many of the regulatory rules governing dealings in securities are part of a broader framework that governs financial products, financial services and financial markets.\n\nMandatory disclosure and conduct regulation underlie much of Australia's securities regulation. False trading, fraudulent dealing, and insider trading are dealt with to prevent improper practices in connection with securities markets. A licensing system operates to ensure securities markets are fair, orderly and transparent. At the same time, securities law is also facilitative, allocating rights and duties in conjunction with general contract law. It also allows for a degree of self-regulation, by the operation for example of an independent securities exchange.\n\nAustralian securities law has been substantially modernised in recent years. The core of these laws are found in the \"Corporations Act\" 2001 (Cth), which contains provisions governing takeovers, fundraising, and financial products, services and markets.\n\nThe main body of substantive law about securities is found in the \"Corporations Act\" 2001 (Cth), as well as the regulations made under that Act. Whilst much of the law is derived from earlier regulation (especially the bust in Australian mineral stocks of the late 1960s), the sections relating to securities regulation have been subject to recent amendment. The takeovers provisions were substantially re-written by the \"Corporation Law Economic Reform Program Act\" 1999. Changes to financial products, financial markets, and financial services were introduced by the \"Financial Services Reform Act\" 2001 (Cth), as a result of the \"Final Report of the Financial System Inquiry\", commonly referred to as \"the Wallis report.\"\n\nElements of securities law are also found in the general law governing contracts, trusts, and torts. Securities regulation under the \"Corporations Act\" operates against the background of other Commonwealth legislation on criminal law, administrative law, and statutory interpretation.\n\nAdministration of the legislation is the responsibility of the Commonwealth Treasurer and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), according to the \"Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act\" 2001 (Cth) and the \"Corporations Act\" 2001 (Cth). The market operator Australian Stock Exchange also has an important regulatory role to play.\n\nThe resolution of disputes is confided to the Federal Court and the Supreme Courts of the States and the Northern Territory, with other courts having some powers to apply the securities legislation.\n\nA security is \"a thing in action\", a claim enforceable by legal proceedings rather than owning some tangible property. To effect regulation the legislation adopts various definitions of \"security\" and \"financial product\" that are used.\n\nThere is also no law which stipulates that no person in which authority is not given (anyone other the law enforcement or owners of an establishment) may restrict persons entering and leaving a premises.\n\nOnly the holder of a market licence may operate a financial market.\n\nA person who carries on a financial services business in the jurisdiction must hold an Australian financial services licence.\n\nPrevention of fraud and other forms of market misconduct has its foundation in the efficient-market hypothesis.\n\nGeneral common law prohibitions against interfering with the free public market are strengthened by statutory prohibitions against various forms of market misconduct.\n\nOne set of statutory prohibitions is upon trading activity which manipulates market prices. There are further prohibitions upon conduct that involves false trading or market rigging.\n"}

It categorises legal studies on copyright so as to inform the public and policy development based on evidence. It was setup and run by CREATe at the University of Glasgow.\n\nCopyright Evidence was established in 2014 by Theo Koutmeridis, Kris Erickson, and Martin Kretschmer, as a project undertaken by the CREATe research centre. The project aims to be a consolidated and interdisciplinary “central source” for evidence-based copyright studies, where users can examine findings and methodology transparently.\n\nAn editorial board was established in December 2017, which included the appointment of a sub-editor responsible for growing the existing base of studies.\n\nInitial studies eligible for Copyright Evidence were identified using a snowball sampling methodology, beginning with a literature review by Watson, Zizzo and Fleming. Thereafter: 103 working papers and pre-prints were identified through the SSRN e-journal Intellectual Property: Empirical Studies (published between November 1996 and July 2015); 81 studies via literature reviews by Handke, Kretschmer, and Kheria; and 50 governmental reports as proposed by CREATe doctoral candidates.\n\nOngoing growth of Copyright Evidence is achieved by search-based identifications. A literature review, conducted by the University of Illinois, confirmed the veracity and comprehensiveness of Copyright Evidence in late-2018.\n\nCopyright Evidence catalogues all “empirical studies on copyright in an attempt to inform policy interventions based on rigorous evidence”. Permitted studies may also include multi-disciplinary elements, and do not need to be strictly legal in nature. Copyright Evidence is currently closed for unauthenticated user submissions, with relevant studies being identified and coded by a community of CREATe research assistants.\n\nEach entry details the main findings of the relevant study, a description of the data involved, and relevant policy considerations. Studies are also categorised (amongst other factors) by country, JEL code, and research method. Iconographic indicators are used to identify the relevant industry, fundamental issues, and policy areas.\n\nCopyright Evidence currently holds details of over 600 evidence-based studies on copyright, and acts as a dynamic literature review platform which is open to text and data mining.\n\nMining and visualisation tools were explored during the 2016 EUHackathon, which identified certain clusters of cross-referencing between key related studies. Governmental reports, for example, tend to cross-reference other governmental reports, but less so academic evidence on copyright.\n\nCopyright Evidence visualisations provide summary statistics on the landscape of the indexed studies. These demonstrate how the majority of copyright studies focus on: (a) the sound recording and music publishing industry; (b) understanding consumption/use (e.g. determinants of unlawful behaviour, user-generated content, social media), and; (c) enforcement (quantifying infringement, criminal sanctions, intermediary liability, graduated response, litigation & court data, commercial VS non-commercial, education & awareness).\n\nCopyright Evidence is cited as a resource to support the use of empirical evidence in informing copyright policy.\n"}

Upon learning of this deviation from his earlier requests, Washington sent another request to Hancock again asking that Congress establish the Court, but Congress did not fulfill his request until almost four years later.\n\nAlthough specific express power to establish the Court was granted to Congress in the Articles of Confederation, the Articles of Confederation were not yet fully ratified by all thirteen of the original states when Congress established the Court on January 15, 1780. However, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Congress nonetheless had inherent power at that time to establish the Court.\n\nThe Court operated from shortly after its founding in 1780 through its final cases in 1787. It officially ceased to exist following ratification of the U.S. Constitution in 1789 that transferred federal judicial power to the newly created U.S. Supreme Court and such other inferior (i.e., lower) federal courts as Congress may establish.\n\nBeginning with Massachusetts on November 1, 1775, several of the American colonies (and, later, states) established prize courts to exercise original jurisdiction over all cases (or libels) of captures (or prizes) consisting of enemy ships and cargo. Establishment of such courts was recommended by Congress on November 25. 1775.\n\nOn November 25, 1775, Congress also asserted federal appellate jurisdiction over such cases. Following repeated scheduling difficulties when Congress attempted to hear the first appeal, Congress initially assigned this jurisdiction to various special committees, followed by a standing committee on Jan. 30, 1777.\n\nLater, on January 15, 1780, Congress established the Court of Appeals in Cases of Capture to exercise this jurisdiction as a court of last resort. On May 24, 1780, Congress transferred all remaining appeals pending before committees to the Court and specified that all future appeals were to be filed directly with the Court.\n\nOn June 27, 1786, the Court's jurisdiction was again expanded to include rehearings and new trials in certain cases wherever justice so required.\n\nSpecial jurisdiction was also conferred upon the Court on February 11, 1782 for a capture adjudicated by a prize court in Connecticut and on July 24, 1786 for a capture of the sloop Chester.\n\nThe first session of the Court was required to be held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at the earliest opportunity. Subsequent sessions were to be held at other times and locations in the United States as deemed conducive to the public good, but no farther east than Hartford, Connecticut, and no farther south than Williamsburg, Virginia. Congress later specified the time and location for some sessions of the Court, including specific sessions to be held at Hartford, Connecticut; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Richmond, Virginia; and New York, New York.\n\nThe primary means of initiating an appeal to the Court required a party to first demand an appeal in the trial court within five days after definitive sentence and then file an appeal in and give adequate security to the Court within forty days after demanding an appeal in the trial court. On Sept. 5, 1781, an extension of time for appeal was granted in the case of a capture decided in favor of Patrick Mahon against Roger Kean. Additionally, some appeals filed with Congress and referred to committees were subsequently transferred to the Court.\n\nTrial by jury was considered inconsistent with the usage of nations, and, therefore, was not authorized in the Court. However, trial by jury was authorized in some of the state prize courts, where Congress initially recommended it, only to later recommend against it.\n\nIn any case before the Court that involved a capture suspected of being collusive, the Court was required to demand sufficient proof to the contrary from the captor and, if the captor failed to meet this burden, the Court was required to award the prize to the state where the original trial was held.\n\nThe Court was composed of three judges, but a quorum only required the presence of two judges.\n\nAll judges serving on the Court were first required to take the following oath of office administered before the President of Congress:\n\nYou do swear or affirm, [that you will well, faithfully and impartially execute the office of one of the judges of the Court of Appeals in Cases of Capture, according to the best of your skill and judgment. So help you God.]\n\nInitially, the judges received annual salaries for their services with reimbursement for expenses, but their compensation was later changed to provide for only fixed daily rates, including time spent traveling on official business of the Court.\n\nThe following individuals were elected by Congress to serve as judges on the Court:\n\nAs judges on the Court, George Read had seniority over John Lowell based on the results of an election in Congress held on Dec. 13, 1782.\n\nSurviving records show that a total of fifty-six cases were lodged with and adjudicated or otherwise disposed of by the Court, including eleven cases that were transferred from committees within Congress to the Court.\n\nAlthough the Court did not generally issue formal written opinions of its decisions, opinions of the Court were nonetheless published in the following cases:\n\n\nCustody of records from the Court was first transferred to the U.S. Supreme Court. However, the National Archives now maintains custody of the records.\n\n\n\n"}

His office worked with the University of Pittsburgh to post information online about lethal batches of heroin.\n\nIn 2011, Hickton assembled a Community Police Working Group to help build trust between members of law enforcement and the public. The group held community-based meetings, developed a Crisis Team, and distributed thousands of surveys to elicit community feedback about community-police relations and safety. In 2015, Pittsburgh was selected by Attorney General Loretta Lynch as one of six pilot cities for the National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice.\n\nFollowing a three-year investigation, Hickton secured fundamental changes in the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections (PDOC) to humanely address the issues of unconstitutional confinement conditions for those suffering from serious mental illness and for victims of institutional sexual assault. He also initiated a case study in police-community reconciliation in the neighborhood of Homewood.\n\nIn 2015, Hickton led an investigation of Education Management Corporation (EDMC), which resulted in the recovery of $95.5 million, the largest False Claims Act (FCA) recovery of Department of Education funds. \n\nIn 2016, Hickton successfully prosecuted former CEO and founder of Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School Nicholas Trombetta, who plead guilty of conspiracy, where he took approximately $8 million of educational funds for illegal use. In 2016, Hickton also lead the prosecution of Michael J. Ruffatto, who transferred to his personal bank account $5.7 million in funds from U.S. Department of Energy’s National Energy Technology Laboratory that was awarded to the North American Power Group.\n\nAt the request of Linda Lane, Superindent of Pittsburgh Public Schools, Hickton responded to an incident of cross burning in front of an elementary school in the city. He said, the incident was a \"notorious sign of hate..\" and that the US Civil Rights Section and the FBI were also participating in the investigation.\n\nHickton and his wife Dawne have been involved in the Loren H. Roth, MD, Summer Research Program in the School of Medicine. Pitt declared Hickton as a Legacy Laureate in 2013. He also received a 225th anniversary medallion, an honor bestowed on alumni who have brought particular honor to the University through their work and service.\n\nIn 2016, Pitt’s School of Law named Hickton one of its Distinguished Alumni. That same year, Hickton was named the Attorney of the Year by The Legal Intelligencer. On January 27, 2017, at the 19th Annual LEAD (Law Enforcement Agency Directors) Awards, Hickton was presented with a special recognition award for his work in the areas of national security and cyber crime.\n\nHickton is a Fellow in the American College of Trial Lawyers and a Fellow of the Academy of Trial Lawyers of Allegheny County. He has been admitted before the U.S. Supreme Court, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, and several of the U.S. circuit courts. In 2013, Hickton and his wife donated $1 million to establish an endowment for the University of Pittsburgh's Elder Law Clinic, a clinic which is designed to teach law students practical skills while providing free legal services to low income older adults and their family members.\n\nUnder President Bill Clinton, Hickton served on the President’s Advisory Committee on the Arts for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. He is an executive board member of the Pittsburgh Public Theater and also served as its president. He was a longtime member of the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, a non-profit agency that works to promote arts and culture in Downtown Pittsburgh. He and his wife have six children and two grandchildren.\n"}

{"id": "36059909", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36059909", "title": "Death of Li Wangyang", "text": "Death of Li Wangyang\n\nLi Wangyang (, 12 November 1950 – 6 June 2012) was a Chinese dissident labor rights activist, member of the Workers Autonomous Federation and chairman of the Shaoyang WAF branch. Following his role in the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, he served twenty-one years in prison on charges of counterrevolutionary propaganda, incitement, and subversion. Of all Chinese pro-democracy activists from 1989, Li has spent the longest time in prison. On 6 June 2012, one year after his release from prison, and a few days after a television interview in which he continued to call for vindication of the Tiananmen Square protests, Li was found hanged in a hospital room. Shaoyang city authorities initially claimed suicide was the cause of death, but it was revised to 'accidental death' after the autopsy.\n\nFollowing a protest march attended by up to 25,000 people, Pan Democrats and senior establishment figures in Hong Kong publicly commented on the suspicious nature of the death, and said they had escalated the demands of citizens to politicians or \"relevant departments\" at national level for an independent investigation. The uproar in Hong Kong is said by commentators have put pressure on mainland authorities to order a criminal investigation so as not to overshadow the impending visit of president Hu Jintao for the 15th anniversary celebrations of the handover of Hong Kong.\n\nA worker in a glass factory, Li Wangyang set up a labour union under inspiration of the Democracy Wall in 1983. In 1989, China saw mass pro-democracy protests throughout the country, with the largest protests in Tiananmen Square, Beijing. After hundreds died when the People's Liberation Army suppressed the protests on 4 June, Li pasted a poster on a Shaoyang traffic sign urging a general strike in support of the protests. Two days later, Li organized a memorial for the victims.\n\nAs a result of his actions, Li was jailed on 9 June for \"counterrevolutionary propaganda and incitement\". He was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment, but his sentence was increased to thirteen years when he appealed to the court. He was also sentenced to hard labour. As his health deteriorated, he was granted medical parole in June 1996, but the authorities cancelled his release after Deng Xiaoping died in 1997, fearing calls for the other responsible officials to be held accounted for the 4 June Massacre. In June 2000 Li was released again for reasons of poor health. Human Rights in China (HRIC) alleged that Li was tortured while in custody, resulting in his losing both his sight and hearing. Li himself said in his last interview that the only explanation for his becoming blind was through nerve damage caused by being repeatedly beaten about the head.\n\nDuring his spells in prison, Li was a frequent inmate in solitary confinement. In 2001, Li began a hunger strike as part of a petition to authorities to repay his health care costs, and was given an additional ten-year sentence for \"inciting subversion\". Whilst attempting to force feed Li during his hunger strike, guards knocked out Li's front teeth. He finally gained freedom in May 2011, when he checked into Daxiang District Hospital to treat his medical conditions. His sister, who lived 7 km away from the hospital, visited him twice a day with his meals\n\nLi remained vocal in demanding vindication of the Tiananmen protesters up until his death: in an interview with i-CABLE broadcast four days before, he said \"the souls of the martyrs deserve to finally find some peace\". He advocated a multi-party democracy for his country, and said he did not regret his fight for a better China, \"even had [he] been beheaded\" In another interview, broadcast on French radio the eve of the 23rd anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown, he appealed to his compatriots \"to observe 6-4\". Amnesty International designated him a prisoner of conscience. \"Apple Daily\" reported that he had no minders before the interviews. After his interviews were broadcast, Li was kept under around the clock surveillance by a team of 10 police officers. An account that was opened to receive donations from supporters from China and abroad to pay his medical fees was inexplicably blocked; he was also severely impeded from going to Beijing to see a specialist physician.\n\nLi was found dead on 6 June 2012, one year after his latest release from prison, in the Daxiang Hospital where he was being treated for heart disease and diabetes. Li was reportedly found on his feet with a strip of cloth tied around his neck and connected to a window bar. Li's next of kin, his sister Li Wangling and her husband Zhao Baozhu, rushed to the hospital shortly after they were telephoned at 6 am. His brother-in-law said that the body was \"on its feet next to his bed, with a white strip of cloth tied tightly around its neck and connected to a window bar above\". The authorities said to relatives that there would be an autopsy. Although the latter were denied permission to take photographs, some stills and one video made it onto the internet. Later, i-Cable television in Hong Kong reported that officials had been attempting to persuade Li's family members to cremate his body immediately.\n\nOfficial statements that Li had committed suicide caused \"outrage\" among China's dissident community, as his family questioned how Li would have been capable of killing himself. They said that leaving aside his minders, Li was blind and nearly deaf and could \"barely hold a bowl without his hands shaking\". Friends and local activists strongly allege that Li was \"suicided\" (被自殺), and formed a 'Committee in quest of the truth about Li's death'. \"The Wall Street Journal\" commented that Chinese activists on Twitter had begun to tweet their own declarations that they had no plans to commit suicide (#我不自杀); dissident Hu Jia recommended that fellow dissidents who are frequently arrested and political prisoners prepare a notarised statement declaring one's lack of intention to commit suicide. To avoid internet censorship, \"suicided\" became a web-search term of choice.\n\nHRIC said Li's sister had been detained by police and was taken to a hotel where they were being held. Media reported that Li's family was under pressure to consent to an autopsy, and that police had given an ultimatum of noon on 8 June. Family members were denied access to the body since police removed it from the hospital. The Information Centre for Human Rights and Democracy conveyed that Li's next of kin were prepared to grant an autopsy subject to the presence of a lawyer from outside Shaoyang. On 8 June, an autopsy of Li's body was carried out by authorities in Shaoyang, apparently against the wishes of his family, and the body was cremated on 9 June. According to the Information Centre for Human Rights and Democracy, an unnamed member of staff at a funeral parlour implied that the government ordered the cremation; another worker told Cable TV that Li's sister and brother-in-law had given signed consent.\n\nAccording to Shaoyang city authorities, people on Li's wards saw him \"acting strangely\" by the window at around 3 am on the day he died. \"Surveillance camera footage showed that on the night Li Wangyang died, no suspicious persons entered the ward except Li's wardmates and hospital staff ... The ward's door was not forced open\", and there were no other bruises on his body.\n\nShaoyang city authorities said the autopsy was conducted by four pathologists from the Sun Yat-sen University on 8 June. It is claimed that the entire process was videotaped and in the presence of the media, members of the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The university is expected to report the autopsy within four days. The city continued to assert that Li committed suicide, that his body was cremated at his family's request, and that his ashes were buried under the supervision of his sister and brother-in-law. The media made a connection to the Wukan protests, pointing out the medical examiner assigned to perform Li's autopsy was the same person who pronounced that Xue Jingbo had died of \"cardiac failure\"\n\nBy the day following news of Li's demise, over 2,700 people, including dissident Ai Weiwei, had signed an online petition calling for an independent investigation. Human rights activist and lawyer Teng Biao posted a picture of a calligraphy scrolls which read \"An inch of blood for an inch of freedom, thousands of miles of rivers bring thousands of miles of woes\" to his Twitter account, dedicating the post to Li. The Information Centre for Human Rights and Democracy raised the possibility that \"security guards monitoring him tortured him to death and faked a suicide\". Amnesty International issued a statement urging the Chinese government to \"thoroughly investigate the circumstances surrounding Li Wangyang's death and take seriously the claims made by his family and friends that this was not suicide\". At the request of the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions (HKCTU), LabourStart launched a global online campaign demanding that the Chinese government open an investigation.\n\nThe death and its subsequent handling angered and sent shock waves through Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China rebuked claims that Li died of suicide. Its convener, Lee Cheuk-yan argued that Li never regretted support for democracy in the course of his imprisonment, and that his poor health condition did not allow him to hang himself under surveillance of National Security Guards. Kinseng Lam, who gave Li the last interview, called it an assassination and believed it was his interview that triggered the authorities to kill him. Alan Leong, Civic Party legislator in Hong Kong, suggested Li 'paid the price' for his interview with iCable TV. Several representatives to the National People's Congress (NPC), including Liberal Party chairman Miriam Lau, Maria Tam, Michael Tien, called on the central government to look into the case. Several staunchly pro-establishment legislators argued against escalating the issue to Beijing. Wong Kwok-kin argued that such incidents were \"daily occurrences\" and that it would be impractical to have them all investigated. Notably, Ip Kwok-him of the DAB initially said it was \"unnecessary\" to write to air his concerns, because Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) members should not tell the authorities how to conduct their affairs. Ip later made a U-turn owing to public pressure. At \"City Forum,\" CPPCC member Lew Mon-hung said he would immediately write to the CPPCC regarding the death under bizarre circumstances. He opined that for a man to be killed under guise of protecting social stability would be complete denial of human rights. Nevertheless, he defended the Central government, saying it was still uncertain whether Li's death was a suicide or a homicide.\n\nAccording to organisers of the march on 10 June, in Hong Kong to demand a thorough investigation into Li's death, 25,000 people attended the largest-scale protest ever at the main entrance of the Central Government Liaison Office; Police estimated the turnout at 5,400. On 13 June 1500 people attended a candlelight vigil held outside the former Legislative Council Building commemorating the seventh day of Li's death.\n\nEditorials in the main newspapers all referred to Li's death as \"suspicious\", and said ongoing publicity about the case is unfavourable to China's image, and that it was in China's interests for the death to be probed transparently by central authorities. An opinion piece in the \"Hong Kong Economic Journal\" said Li's death stoked the anger of the Hong Kong people and brought up to 25,000 people onto the streets. \"It not only reopened the wounds of the Tiananmen protests; the ridiculous claims that he committed suicide was a travesty of the rule of law\". The writer lamented that despite China's rise, she still languished third from last in world rankings in terms of respect for human rights. In a piece translated and published in the \"South China Morning Post\", Chang Ping wrote that Li's death \"exposed the relationship between the June 4 crackdown and the Chinese government's policy to 'maintain stability' ... [which] becomes the priority that overrides all. June 4 became the government's model for dealing with any dissent, using extreme force.\"\n\nWang Xiangwei, the newly appointed editor-in-Chief of the \"South China Morning Post\" was criticised for his decision to reduce paper's coverage of Li' death on 7 June. Wang reportedly reversed the decision to run a full story, and instead published a two-paragraph report inside the paper; other news media reported it prominently. A senior staff member who sought to understand the decision received a stern rebuff by return email from Wang. Self-censorship concerns were raised in the Chinese-language press of the territory because Wang is mainland born, and is a member of the Jilin Provincial CPPCC. Other than on the first day, Li's death and aftermath was covered in the \"Post\" as major news stories. On 21 June, responding to news of alleged downplaying of Li's case, Wang said he understood the \"huge responsibility to deliver news... [and]... the journalistic heritage we have inherited\". He said that his decision not to pursue extensive coverage as the story broke was pending \"more facts and details surrounding the circumstances of this case\".\n\nOutgoing Health Secretary York Chow was the first minister to express scepticism of the 'suicide' claim; then others followed suit. Former Legco president and National People's Congress Standing Committee member Rita Fan noted the doubts of the public in Hong Kong over the death of Li Wangyang. She said that \"If these doubts can be resolved, and if some people are held responsible, Hong Kong people will have a better impression of the country.\" She added that \"Matters like these happen because the officials do not value the lives of the people, do not respect the rights of the people … do not have an in-depth understanding of accountability to the people.\" Chief Executive-elect, CY Leung maintained his refusal to directly comment on Li's death, which was universally hailed as \"suspicious\". Many local pro-establishment politicians said they had escalated the matter to various Communist Party officials or bodies.\n\nNine days after the death, outgoing Chief Executive Donald Tsang expressed doubts about Li's case, said he understood the views of Hong Kong people. He said: \"Under the principle of 'one country, two systems', the most important responsibility for a chief executive is to safeguard the freedoms of speech and expression of Hong Kong people\"; Chief executive-elect CY Leung said he shared the feelings of fellow citizens about the issue. On 16 June, Chief Executive-elect, C.Y. Leung, observed a minute's silence in honour of Li at a function, but maintained that it would be \"inappropriate\" for him to comment on the death.\n\nPro-democracy Macanese legislators Chan Wai Chi, Au Kam San and Ng Kuok Cheong wrote to PRC Premier Wen Jiabao and other deputies to the Chinese People’s National Congress demanding an investigation of Li's mysterious \"suicide\". They protested the Shaoyang public security office ignoring escalating calls for a transparent investigation Li's death, and accused them of \"destroying the evidence\" by cremating Li’s body.\n\nFollowing the public outcry, Li Gang, deputy director of the Hong Kong–central government liaison office in said that Hunan Public Security Bureau ordered a criminal investigation into the death. Li said: \"We have noted the concern expressed by the Hong Kong community and media on [Li Wangyang's death]. We have reflected their concerns to the relevant departments in the central government.\" The \"South China Morning Post\" noted that announcement about the forensic and criminal investigation by experts from outside Hunan province came through the semi-official Hong Kong China News Agency rather than Xinhua, saying it indicated that the announcement was targeted at Hong Kong, designed to calm public anger. Pundits say the uproar in Hong Kong has put pressure on mainland authorities to order a criminal investigation so as not to threaten the legacy of outgoing president Hu Jintao and overshadow his impending visit for the 15th anniversary celebrations of the handover of Hong Kong. Political commentator Johnny Lau said that if Hu had not been planning on coming to Hong Kong, \"the case could drag on or may be forgotten\".\n\n"}

This responsibility is at present distributed among various government departments, statutory agencies and components of the Oireachtas (parliament).\n\nAn electoral commission was recommended by several official reports, including the Second Report (2006) of the Commission on Electronic Voting. Private member's bills to establish an electoral commission were introduced by Ciarán Lynch in 2008 and 2012.\n\nIn 2008, the then Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government commissioned and published a study on introducing an electoral commission, carried out by academics from University College Dublin. After the 2011 general election, the Fine Gael and Labour parties formed a coalition government whose programme included a commitment to establish an electoral commission. Such a commission was also recommended in the Constitutional Convention's 2013 report on the system of elections to Dáil Éireann (lower house of the Oireachtas), which was also endorsed the government. Alan Kelly, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, outlined progress of the plan in Seanad Éireann (upper house of the Oireachtas) in December 2014, The government published a consultation paper in January 2015, and said it intended to introduce a bill in the Oireachtas in 2015. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht discussed the plan with Alan Kelly on 10 March 2015. Kelly stated that drafting the enabling bill would begin when the committee had consulted and reported back to him, that he expected the bill to be enacted by the end of 2015, that the commission would not be established before the next general election, and that functions should be assigned to it on a phased basis. In April 2015 the committee invited submissions on the government's consultation paper from interest groups, and held hearings with them in June and July. The committee's report was launched on 14 January 2016. \n\nAfter the 2016 general election, a minority coalition government was formed by Fine Gael and independents with confidence and supply support from Fianna Fáil. Its programme commits to establishing an electoral commission \"independent of Government and directly accountable to the Oireachtas\". The government's September 2016 list of planned legislation includes the Electoral Commission Bill in the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government's \"medium and long term\" plans. In June 2017, the Department was preparing a Regulatory Impact Analysis. In October 2017, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said there was \"no timeframe\" for establishing the commission and it was \"very much a long-term project\".\n\nThe Constitutional Convention took the Australian Electoral Commission and UK Electoral Commission as case studies of possible models for the Irish body.

Usually, at least the following sources are considered as renewable:\n\n\nGreen certificates represent the environmental value of renewable energy generated. The certificates can be traded separately from the energy produced. Several countries use green certificates as a mean to make the support of green electricity generation closer to a market economy instead of more bureaucratic investment support and feed-in tariffs. Such national trading schemes are in use in e.g. Poland, Sweden, the UK, Italy, Belgium (Wallonia and Flanders), and some US states.\n\nOnce in the grid, renewable energy is impossible to separate from the conventionally generated energy.

{"id": "6016189", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6016189", "title": "Horse slaughter", "text": "Horse slaughter\n\nHorse slaughter is the practice of slaughtering horses to produce meat for consumption. Humans have long consumed horse meat; the oldest known cave art, the 30,000-year-old paintings in France's Chauvet Cave, depict horses with other wild animals hunted by humans. Equine domestication is believed to have begun to raise horses for human consumption. The practice has become controversial in some parts of the world due to several concerns: whether horses are (or can be) managed humanely in industrial slaughter; whether horses not raised for consumption yield safe meat, and whether it is appropriate to consume a companion animal.\n\nIn most countries where horses are slaughtered for food, they are processed in industrial abattoirs similarly to cattle. Typically, a penetrating captive bolt gun or gunshot is used to render the animal unconscious. The blow (or shot) is intended to kill the horse instantly or stun it, with exsanguination (bleeding out) conducted immediately afterwards to ensure death. Saleable meat is removed from the carcass, with the remains rendered for other commercial uses.\n\nAccording to equine-welfare advocates, the physiology of the equine cranium is such that neither the penetrating captive bolt gun nor gunshots are reliable means of killing (or stunning) a horse; the animal may be only paralyzed. Unless properly checked for vital signs, a horse may remain conscious and experience pain during skinning and butchering.\n\nHorse meat was a traditional protein source during food shortages, such as the early-20th-century World Wars. Before the advent of motorized warfare, campaigns usually resulted in tens of thousands of equine deaths; troops and civilians ate the carcasses, since troop logistics were often unreliable. Troops of Napoleon's Grande Armée killed almost all of their horses during their retreat from Moscow to feed themselves. In his biography, \"Fifty Years a Veterinary Surgeon\", Fredrick Hobday wrote that when his British Army veterinary field hospital arrived in Cremona from France in 1916 it was the subject of a bidding war (won by Milanese horse-meat canners) for salvageable equine carcasses.\n\nDuring World War II, the less-motorized Axis troops lost thousands of horses in combat and during the unusually-cold Russian winters. Malnourished soldiers consumed the animals, often shooting weaker horses as needed. In his 1840s book, \"London Labour and the London Poor\", Henry Mayhew wrote that horse meat was priced differently in Paris and London.\n\nIn some countries, horses are perceived as gods or as deserving of humane consideration because of their roles as working animals and for sport. This perception may be greater in countries where horses are not bred or raised for food. According to a 2012 UK MORI survey, 50 percent of respondents in France as well as 51 percent in Belgium and 58 percent in Italy thought it acceptable to eat horses.\n\nSeveral equine and animal-welfare organizations oppose slaughter or support a ban on horse slaughter, but other animal organizations and animal-agriculture groups support the practice. According to livestock-slaughter expert Temple Grandin, horse slaughter can be humane with proper facility design and management. Included in animal-agriculture groups supporting horse slaughter are organizations representing the interests of traditional food-animal industries such as cattle, sheep and pigs, who are concerned that banning any animal for slaughter will lead to outlawing all meat production.\n\nStolen horses have been sold to auctions, where they are bought by \"kill buyers\" and shipped to slaughter. Auctions enable horses to be sold without owner consent, by theft or misappropriation. According to California Livestock and Identification Bureau statistics, the 1998 ban on horse slaughter in California was followed by a 34-percent decrease in horse theft.\n\nOne concern about the welfare of horses destined for slaughter is the long distances the horses are sometimes transported to a slaughterhouse. In 2013, 32,841 horses were slaughtered in Italy; of these, 32,316 were transported from other EU states.\n\nHorses in the United States are not bred or raised for meat. Nearly all equine medications and treatments are labeled, \"Not for horses intended for human consumption.\" Meat from American horses raises a number of potential health concerns, primarily due to the routine use of medications banned in food animals and a lack of tracking of such use. Unlike livestock raised for food (where all potential medications are tested for withdrawal times and vigilantly tracked), there is no way to guarantee which medications have been used in a particular horse. During November and December 2010 inspections of EU-regulated plants in Mexico which slaughtered horses for human consumption, the European Commission Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) uncovered violations. Most American horses destined for slaughter are transported to EU-regulated plants in Mexico and Canada. Horses, unlike traditional food animals in the United States, are not raised (or medicated) with the intent of becoming human food. Because American horses are not intended for the human food chain, they often receive medications banned by the Food and Drug Administration for use in food animals. Concern also exists that horse meat will be mixed with ground-beef products and sold improperly labeled in the US, as occurred during the European 2013 horse meat scandal.\n\nBefore 2007, three major equine slaughterhouses operated in the United States: Dallas Crown in Kaufman, Texas; Beltex Corporation in Fort Worth, and Cavel International in DeKalb, Illinois. All were Belgian-owned, with Multimeat also having French and Dutch ownership; Velda owned Cavel, Multimeat owned Beltex and Chevideco owned Dallas Crown. The slaughterhouses exported about $42 million in horse meat annually, with most going overseas. About 10 percent of their output was sold to zoos to feed their carnivores, and 90 percent was shipped to Europe and Asia for human consumption. Although the House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly to end horse slaughter in 2006, the bill never came to a vote before the Senate. The two Texas horse-slaughter plants in were ordered closed in 2007, after protracted battles with local municipalities who objected to their financial drain on the municipalities (no tax revenue), ditches of blood, dismembered foals and noxious odors in residential neighborhoods. Later that year, the Cavel plant was closed after local community action.\n\nThe director of equine protection of the Humane Society of the United States reported seizing large numbers of horses, and equine-rescue facilities were taking in more horses than ever despite a record number of horses shipped to Canada and Mexico for slaughter. The equine market was saturated by increased breeding.\n\nIn March 2012, Wyoming state Representative Sue Wallis proposed a new horse-meat processing plant in Missouri or Arkansas. According to Wallis, she had six million dollars to invest and support from Belgian horse-meat buyers. In May Wallis sought local investors in Wyoming to help finance the plant, which she said could cost between two and six million dollars and would process up to 200 horses a day for sale abroad and to ethnic markets in the US. In 2013 the Obama Administration proposed the removal of funding for USDA inspection of horse-slaughter plants in the 2014 fiscal year, which would prevent horse slaughter.\n\nEfforts have been made to create a federal law ending the slaughter of American horses for human consumption. On September 8, 2006, the House of Representatives passed a bill which would have made killing or selling American horses for human consumption illegal in the United States; however, it was not passed by the Senate.\n\nTwo bills, H.R. 503 in the House and S. 1915 in the Senate, were introduced in the 109th Congress to prevent the slaughter of horses for human consumption. H.R. 503 was passed by the House on September 7, 2006, by a recorded vote of 263–146. S. 1915 was read twice, referred to committee and not voted on. Both bills died at the end of the 109th Congress, and were reintroduced in the 110th Congress on January 17, 2007 as H.R. 503 and S. 311. S. 311 was reported out but not taken up for a vote. The bills were not reintroduced in the 111th Congress. Two bills were introduced in the 112th Congress: H.R. 2966 and S. 1176, the American Horse Slaughter Prevention Act of 2011. The latter was introduced on July 9, 2011 by Senators Mary Landrieu (D-LA) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) to amend the Horse Protection Act of 1970 () to prohibit the shipping, transporting, moving, delivering, receiving, possessing, purchasing, selling, or donation of horses and other equines to be slaughtered for human consumption.\n\nAlthough the Department of Transportation has officers at enforcement points to ensure the proper transportation of horses, it has no jurisdiction beyond transportation. Horses that \"are severely lame or disabled are not accepted at the plants\".\n\nA 1998 USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service survey to determine welfare problems during equine transport to slaughter found severe problems in 7.7 percent of the transported horses; most arose from owner neglect or abuse, rather than transportation. The report recommended fining individuals who transport horses unfit for travel. However, despite those recommendations, in an April 2011 report on equine transport violations, of 458 violators and 280 cases reported since February 1, 2002, 51 violators were fined a total of $781,350. The highest fines imposed were $230,000.00 on Charles Carter of Colorado, $162,000 on Leroy Baker of Ohio and $77,825 on Bill Richardson of Texas. A 2007–2015 investigation by Animals' Angels found overcrowded pens, aggression, rough handling, transport with no rest, untreated injuries and no water or food for more than the 28 hours required by law. On February 22, 2007, Representative Robert Molaro introduced HB1711 to the Illinois General Assembly to prohibit the transport of horses into the state for the sole purpose of slaughter for human consumption.\n\nUS Department of Agriculture regulations govern the transportation of horses, but the USDA has said that it does not have the resources for enforcement. In 2009, a bill which would have prohibited the interstate transport of live horses in double-deck horse trailers passed out of committee in the House of Representatives and was placed on the Union Calendar. The bill died at the end of the 111th Congress.\n\nOn November 18, 2011, the ban on the slaughter of horses for meat was lifted as part of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2012. However, it was reestablished by Congress on January 14, 2014 with the passage of the Fiscal Year 2014 Omnibus Appropriations Act.\n\nOn March 12, 2013 Senators Landrieu and Graham introduced S. 541, the Safeguard American Food Exports (SAFE) Act of 2013. The SAFE Act amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to deem equine (horses and other members of the family Equidae) parts an unsafe food additive or animal drug. The SAFE Act also prohibits the knowing sale or transport of equines (or equine parts) in interstate or foreign commerce for human consumption. An identical version of the bill, H.R. 1094, was introduced in the House of Representatives by Representatives Patrick Meehan (R-PA) and Jan Schakowsky (D-IL).\n\nOn January 19, 2007, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans overturned a lower court's 2006 ruling that a 1949 Texas law banning horse slaughter for the purpose of selling the meat for food was invalid because it had been repealed by another statute and was preempted by federal law. A panel of three 5th Circuit judges disagreed, saying that the Texas law still stood and was enforceable. On March 6, 2007, without comment or dissent, the 19 judges of the 5th Circuit rejected a petition by three foreign-owned slaughter plants seeking a full court review of the panel's January 19 decision.\n\nIn 2007, the \"Daily Mail\" reported that up to 5,000 horses were slaughtered annually in the United Kingdom—not for domestic consumption but for export, primarily to France. According to the article, UK law \"effectively forbids\" the export of live animals for slaughter. The RSPCA has listed horses as animals exported from Ramsgate since the port's 2011 reopening for live-animal export.\n\nIn the European 2013 horse meat scandal, foods advertised as containing beef were found to contain undeclared or improperly declared horse meat—100 percent of the meat content, in some cases. A smaller number of products also contained other undeclared meats, such as pork. The issue came to light on January 15, 2013, when it was reported that equine DNA had been discovered in frozen beefburgers sold at several Irish and British supermarkets.\n\nAccording to the 2007 \"Daily Mail\" article, 100,000 horses were transported annually into and around the European Union for human consumption in France and Belgium. In 2011, Belgian and Dutch consumers learned about equine-slaughter-related cruelty in North and South America. Undercover video footage broadcast on three news programs showed that horses designated for slaughter are starved, dehydrated and injured. Within hours of the programs, supermarkets responded with promises to investigate. Delhaize, Belgium's second-largest food retailer, asked its supplier to remove the affected meat from its shelves. Two other major grocers told consumers that they do not import horse meat from outside Europe.\n\n"}

It passed the House on February 13, 2013 by a vote of 422-0. President Obama signed the Act into law on August 9, 2013.\n\nThe Bill is intended to change some of the regulations in the United States surrounding hydropower by making it easier to develop smaller-output hydropower stations. According to the bill's proponents, current regulations are unwieldy and represent a significant hurdle to creating more hydropower plants. The Bill would alter those regulations to make it easier for smaller plants to get approval quickly. The legislation also requires the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to study how to further improve the regulatory process. The Bill would amend the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) and the Federal Power Act. Currently, hydropower projects that produce 5,000 kilowatts or less of power do not require certain licenses. The Bill would raise that amount to 10,000 kilowatts, facilitating the speed at which smaller hydropower projects could be built. The existing rules mean that it takes about five years for hydropower projects to get approval, according to hydropower industry sources.\n\nHydropower is a significant source of renewable energy in the United States. The National Hydropower Association (NHA) conducted a study that concluded that \"the United States could add approximately 60,000 MW of new hydropower capacity by 2025, potentially creating as many as 700,000 jobs in the process,\" according to the Committee Report released by the House Energy and Commerce Committee when it referred the Bill to the floor.\n\nA similar bill, , was introduced in the 112th United States Congress, where it passed the House by a vote of 372-0, but was never voted on in the Senate.\n\nThe Bill was introduced into the House on January 15, 2013 by Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA). It was sent to the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the United States House Energy Subcommittee on Energy and Power. It passed the House by a vote of 422-0 on February 13, 2013.\n\nAfter passing in the House, the Bill was referred to the United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on February 14, 2013. A ranking member of the Committee, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), told \"The Hill\" that she expected the Bill to pass in the Senate as well. Power Magazine also reported that chances for passage in the Senate looked good.\n\n\"This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source.\"\n\nSection 1 of the Bill provides the short title of the bill, \"Hydropower Regulatory Efficiency Act of 2013\", and gives a table of contents for the bill.\n\nSection 2 of the Bill provides the \"Findings\" of Congress. It has a short description of facts that Congress lists as a way to provide context for why they are writing the bill and want to make this new law. In this bill, Congress lists the number of Americans who work in the hydropower industry (approximately 300, 000), the number of dams in the United States that are used to produce power (less than 3% of 80, 000), and that hydropower provides 7% of the energy generated in the United States.\n\nSection 3 of the Bill would amend the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) to increase from 5,000 to 10,000 kilowatts the size of small hydroelectric power projects which the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) may exempt from its license requirements.\n\nSection 4 of the Bill would amend the Federal Power Act to revise the limitation on the maximum installation capacity of qualifying conduit hydropower facilities that are eligible for an exemption from licensing requirements.\n\nIt would also require any person, state, or municipality proposing to construct a qualifying conduit hydroelectricity facility to file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) a notice of intent to do so. It would require FERC, within 15 days after receiving such a notice of intent, to make an initial determination as to whether the facility meets the qualifying criteria.\n\nThe Bill would then waive the license requirements for any Conduit hydroelectricity facility that:\n\nThe bill then redefines \"conduit\" to specify any tunnel, canal, pipeline, aqueduct, flume, ditch, or similar man-made water conveyance operated for the distribution of water for agricultural, municipal, or industrial consumption and not primarily for the generation of electricity.\n\nThe new law would authorize the FERC to:\n\nSection 6 of the Bill would direct the FERC to:\n\nFinally, Section 7 would direct the Department of Energy to study:\n\nSome environmental groups, such as American Rivers, support the bill because it primarily addresses only very small power plants, which are less disruptive to the environment than the much larger megadams many environmental groups oppose.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office report on the Bill indicates that it would have no significant net impact on the federal budget. The changes made by the bill would reduce the workload for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The studies the bill requires the Department of Energy to make are similar to on-going studies of hydropower and would not require much additional funding.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "695514", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=695514", "title": "Judicature Acts", "text": "Judicature Acts\n\nThe Judicature Acts are a series of Acts of Parliament, beginning in the 1870s, which aimed to fuse the hitherto split system of courts in England and Wales. The first two Acts were the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 (36 & 37 Vict c. 66) and the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1875 (38 & 39 Vict c. 77), with a further series of amending acts (12 in all by 1899).\n\nBy the Act of 1873 (ss. 3, 4), the Court of Chancery, the Court of Queen's Bench (known as the King's Bench when there is a male Sovereign), the Court of Common Pleas, the Court of Exchequer, the High Court of Admiralty, the Court of Probate, and the Court of Divorce and Matrimonial Causes were consolidated into the Supreme Court of Judicature, subdivided into two courts: the \"High Court of Justice\" (\"High Court\"), with (broadly speaking) original jurisdiction, and the \"Court of Appeal\". Besides this restructuring, the objects of the act were threefold:\n\n\nThe enactment was bold and revolutionary. By one section, the Queen's Bench, the Common Pleas (in which only serjeants formerly had the right of audience), and the Exchequer, and all their jurisdiction, whether criminal, legal, or equitable, were vested in the new court. The fusion of the systems of law and equity was not complete, however, as the Chancery (equity) division retained a distinct existence within the new court from the Queen's Bench (common law) division, having a certain range of legal questions under its exclusive control, and possessing to a certain extent a peculiar machinery of its own for carrying its decrees into execution. Nevertheless, all actions could now for the first time be initiated in a single High Court, and (subject to such special assignments of business as mentioned) could be tried in any of its divisions.\n\nThe procedure of the common law courts had developed along highly technical and stylised lines. For example, to bring an action in the common law courts a litigant had to file a \"writ\" chosen from a set of standard forms. The court would only recognise certain \"forms of action\", and this led to the widespread use of legal fictions, with litigants disguising their claims when they did not fit into a standard recognised \"form\". The emphasis on rigid adherence to established forms led to substantial injustice.\n\nOn the other hand, the Court of Chancery (a court of equity) ran separately and parallel to the common law courts, and emphasised the need to \"do justice\" on the basis of the Lord Chancellor's conscience, softening the blunt instrument of the common law. However, by the nineteenth century proceedings before the Court of Chancery often dragged on and on, with cases not being decided for years at a time (a problem that was parodied by Charles Dickens in the fictional case of \"Jarndyce and Jarndyce\" in \"Bleak House\"). Also, the practice of the court departed from the original principle of the Lord Chancellor's conscience, wary of its legal superiority, clarified for once and for all 1615, wherever it conflicted with the common law. The court undertook self-restraint to safeguard its position. It elaborated the maxims of equity, many centuries old, that restrict its jurisdiction to certain fields of law, impose preconditions for suits/applications and curtail its remedies (particularly damages) which equity might award if there were no common law courts or statute. \n\nThe existence of these two separate systems in some of the more common areas of law enabled each party to go \"forum shopping\", selecting whichever of the two systems would most likely give judgment in his or her favour. A wealthy loser in one court would often try a court in the other system, for good measure.\n\nThe solution adopted by the Judicature Acts of 1873 and 1875 was to amalgamate the courts into one Supreme Court of Judicature which was directed to administer both law and equity.. Pleadings became more relaxed, with the emphasis shifting from the 'form' of action to the 'cause' (or a set of causes) of action. Writs for action were filled out for a litigant stating facts, without any necessity of pigeonholing them into specific forms. The same court was now able to apply rules of the common law and the rules of equity, depending on what the substantial justice of a case required, and depending on what specific area of law the pleadings involved. The result was that, when the issues arising from the causes of action were decided in favour of one party, that party got relief.\n\nThere were originally three common law divisions of the High Court corresponding with the three former courts of common law. However, after the deaths of Lord Chief Baron Kelly (on 17 September 1880), and Lord Chief Justice Cockburn (on 10 November 1880), the Common Pleas and Exchequer divisions were consolidated (by an Order in Council of 10 December 1880) with the Queen's Bench division into a single division, under the presidency of the Lord Chief Justice of England, to whom, by the Judicature Act 1881 s. 25, all the statutory jurisdiction of the Chief Baron and the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas was transferred. The High Court, therefore, came to consist of the Chancery division, the common law division (known as the Queen's Bench division), and the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty division. To the Queen's Bench division was also attached, by an order of the Lord Chancellor dated 1 January 1884, the business of the London Court of Bankruptcy.\n\nThe keystone of the structure created by the Judicature Acts was a strong court of appeal. The House of Lords remained the last court of appeal, as before the Acts, but its judicial functions were transferred in practice to an appellate committee, consisting of the lord chancellor and other peers who had held high judicial office, and certain Lords of Appeal in Ordinary created by the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876.\n\nThe High Court and Court of Appeal were formerly referred to as comprising the Supreme Court of Judicature, a concept wholly distinct from the current Supreme Court of the United Kingdom\n\nThe most important matter dealt with by the rules is the mode of pleading. The authors of the Judicature Act had before them two systems of pleading, both of which were open to criticism. The common law pleadings (it was said) did not state the facts on which the pleader relied, but only the legal aspect of the facts or the inferences from them, while the chancery pleadings were lengthy, tedious and to a large extent irrelevant and useless.\n\nThere was some exaggeration in both statements. In pursuing the fusion of law and equity which was the dominant legal idea of law reformers of that period, the framers of the first set of rules devised a system which they thought would meet the defects of both systems, and be appropriate for both the common-law and the chancery divisions. In a normal case, the plaintiff delivered his statement of claim, in which he was to set forth concisely the facts on which he relied, and the relief which he asked. The defendant then delivered his statement of defence, in which he was to say whether he admitted or denied the plaintiff's facts (every averment not traversed being taken to be admitted), and any additional facts and legal defences on which he relied. The plaintiff might then reply, and the defendant rejoin, and so on until the pleaders had exhausted themselves. This system of pleading was not a bad one if accompanied by the right of either party to demur to his opponent's pleading, i.e. to say, \"admitting all your averments of fact to be true, you still have no cause of action\", or \"defence\" (as the case may be).\n\nIt may be, however, that the authors of the new system were too intent on uniformity when they abolished the common-law pleading, which, shorn of its abuses (as it had been by the Common Law Procedure Acts), was an admirable instrument for defining the issue between the parties though unsuited for the more complicated cases which are tried in chancery, and it might possibly have been better to try the new system in the first instance in the chancery division only.\n\nIt should be added that the rules contain provisions for actions being tried without pleadings if the defendant does not require a statement of claim, and for the plaintiff in an action of debt obtaining immediate judgment unless the defendant gets leave to defend. In the chancery division there are of course no pleadings in those matters which by the rules can be disposed of by summons in chambers instead of by ordinary suit as formerly.\n\nThe judges seem to have been dissatisfied with the effect of their former rules, for in 1883 they issued a fresh set of consolidated rules, which, with subsequent amendments, are those now in force. By these rules a further attempt was made to prune the exuberance of pleading. Concise forms of statement of claim and defence were given in the appendix for adoption by the pleader. It is true that these forms do not display a high standard of excellence in draftsmanship, and it was said that many of them were undoubtedly demurrable, but that was not of much importance.\n\nDemurrers were abolished, and instead it was provided that any point of law raised by the pleadings should be disposed of at or after the trial, provided that by consent or order of the court they might be set down and disposed of before the trial (Order xxv. rules I, 2). This, in the opinion of Lord Davey in 1902, was a disastrous change. The right of either party to challenge his opponent \"in limine\", either where the question between them was purely one of law, or where even the view of the facts taken and alleged by his opponent did not constitute a cause of action or defence, was a most valuable one, and tended to the curtailment of both the delay and the expense of litigation. Any possibility of abuse by frivolous or technical demurrers (as undoubtedly was formerly the case) had been met by powers of amendment and the infliction of costs.\n\nMany of the most important questions of law had been decided on demurrer both in common law and chancery. Lord Davey considered that demurrer was a useful and satisfactory mode of trying questions in chancery (on bill and demurrer), and it was frequently adopted in preference to a special case, which requires the statement of facts to be agreed to by both parties and was consequently more difficult and expensive. It is obvious that a rule which makes the normal time for decision of questions at law the trial or subsequently, and a preliminary decision the exception, and such exception dependent on the consent of both parties or an order of the court, is a poor substitute for a demurrer as of right, and it has proved so in practice. The editors of the \"Yearly Practice\" for 1901 (Muir Mackenzie, Lushington and Fox) said (p. 272): \"Points of law raised by the pleadings are usually disposed of at the trial or on further consideration after the trial of the issues of fact,\" that is to say, after the delay, worry and expense of a trial of disputed questions of fact which after all may turn out to be unnecessary.\n\nThe abolition of demurrers has also (it is believed) had a prejudicial effect on the standard of legal accuracy and knowledge required in practitioners. Formerly the pleader had the fear of a demurrer before him. Nowadays, he need not stop to think whether his cause of action or defence will hold water or not, and anything which is not obviously frivolous or vexatious will do by way of pleading for the purpose of the trial and for getting the opposite party into the box.\n\nAnother change was made by the rules of 1883, which was regarded by some common law lawyers as revolutionary. Formerly every issue of fact in a common law action, including the amount of damage, had to be decided by the verdict of a jury. \"The effect of the rules of 1883,\" said Lord Lindley, who was a member of the rule committee, \"was to make trial without a jury the normal mode of trial, except where trial with a jury is ordered under rules 6 or 7a, or may be had without an order under rule 2\". The effect of the rules may be thus summarised:\n\n\nAmong the specific changes to procedure that occurred as a result of enactment of the Judicature Acts was one impacting on the matter of \"abandonment of an action\". Such an abandonment involves the discontinuance of proceedings commenced in the High Court, typically emerging because a plaintiff is convinced that he will not succeed in a civil action. Prior to the 1875 Act, considerable latitude was allowed as to the time when a suitor might abandon his action, and yet preserve his right to bring another action on the same suit (see nonsuit); but since 1875 this right has been considerably curtailed, and a plaintiff who has delivered his reply (see pleading), and afterwards wishes to abandon his action, can generally obtain leave so to do only on condition of bringing no further proceedings in the matter.\n\nFurther steps have been taken with a view to simplification of procedure. By Order xxx. rule i (as amended in 1897), a summons, called a summons for directions, has to be taken out by a plaintiff immediately after the appearance of the defendant, and upon such summons an order is to be made respecting pleadings, and a number of interlocutory proceedings. To make such an order at that early stage would seem to demand a prescience and intelligent anticipation of future events which can hardly be expected of a master, or even a judge in chambers, except in simple cases, involving a single issue of law or fact which the parties are agreed in presenting to the court. The effect of the rule is that the plaintiff cannot deliver his statement of claim, or take any step in the action without the leave of the judge. In Chancery cases the order usually made is that the plaintiff deliver his .statement of claim, and the rest of the summons stand over, and the practical effect is merely to add a few pounds to the costs. It may be doubted whether, as applied to the majority of actions, the rule does not proceed on wrong lines, and whether it would not be better to leave the parties, who know the exigencies of their case better even than a judge in chambers, to proceed in their own way, subject to stringent provisions for immediate payment of the costs occasioned by unnecessary, vexatious, or dilatory proceedings. The order does not apply to admiralty cases or to proceedings under the order next mentioned.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Ireland) 1877 followed the same lines as the English Acts: the pre-existing courts were consolidated into a Supreme Court of Judicature, consisting of a High Court of Justice and a Court of Appeal. The Judicature Acts did not affect the Scottish judicial system, but the Appellate Jurisdiction Act included the Court of Session among the courts from which an appeal would lie to the House of Lords.\n\n"}

It is the world's highest-grossing law firm, with US$3.165 billion in revenue.\n\nKirkland's private equity, restructuring, and intellectual property groups are largely regarded as industry leaders. Kirkland is also known for its litigation practice, aimed mainly at large corporate clients that go to trial.\n\nKirkland is the third most profitable law firm in the world, with estimated profit per equity partner of US$4.701 million. Kirkland is also known for paying associates above-market salaries through performance-based bonuses that exceed those offered by peer firms. The starting salary for first-year associates is US$190,000.\n\nKirkland was ranked second in the 2017 ATL Power 100 law firm rankings. Vault ranks Kirkland as the most prestigious firm in Chicago and the #1 firm in the U.S. for private equity, restructuring, and business outlook.\n\nIn 1909, two young attorneys, Stuart G. Shepard and Robert R. McCormick, teamed up to form the Chicago-based partnership that would eventually become Kirkland & Ellis. McCormick was the grandson of Joseph Medill, the founder of the \"Chicago Tribune\". McCormick was an \"innovative and forceful lawyer\" who had also served with distinction in World War I. By 1920, McCormick had become so active in the business affairs of the \"Chicago Tribune\" that he left the firm to take over as the \"Tribune\"'s publisher.\n\nAs a consequence of McCormick's outspoken, crusading editorial policy the \"Tribune\" soon required the services of a first-class trial lawyer to defend against a slew of defamation cases. McCormick turned to Weymouth Kirkland, who had joined the firm in 1915. Over the course of his career, Kirkland attracted some of the firm's largest clients. Often described as a brilliant trial lawyer, he served as chief counsel to the \"Tribune\" and other newspapers in various cases that became landmarks in free speech and libel law.\n\nKirkland's partner, Howard Ellis, was a pivotal contributor to the firm's early history. Ellis joined the firm as a young associate in 1915. Ellis assisted Kirkland in many of his most famous trials, in which they defended clients such as Standard Oil Company, the Associated Press, the Chicago Board of Trade, among others. The duo made legal history in a landmark libel suit brought by Henry Ford in 1919, during which Ellis pioneered the defense of fair comment, which is today a basic right of free speech.\n\nIn 1938, Kirkland and Ellis hired young trial lawyer Hammond E. Chaffetz from the U.S. Department of Justice. Chaffetz is noted for ushering in \"the modern era of the firm\". A skilled lawyer and leader, Chaffetz employed a personal touch in his recruiting efforts, often taking outstanding law students to dinners and on walks to bring them into the firm. In his six decades at the firm, Chaffetz's techniques were noted for helping the firm grow to about 780 lawyers, making it one of the top 30 largest in the country. Kirkland currently has offices in Beijing, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Hong Kong, Houston, London, Los Angeles, Munich, New York, Palo Alto, San Francisco, Shanghai and Washington, D.C.\n\nIn recent years, Kirkland has stood out as the most consistently growing Am Law 200 firm. The firm's revenue increased by 147 percent over the last 10 years. Between 2009 and 2016, Kirkland was one of nine Am Law 200 firms to have posted growth in six of the seven years in revenue, revenue per lawyer, profit per lawyer, and profit per equity partner. Of those nine, Kirkland posted the best cumulative growth in each of those four areas. In September 2016, Kirkland & Ellis hired all of the attorneys from the firm Bancroft PLLC. In 2017, the firm grew revenue by 19 percent.\n\n\nKirkland, through its employees, was a top-20 contributor to Barack Obama in 2008, giving at least $493,735. The firm's attorneys leaned heavily (77%) Democratic in their political contributions during the 2008 election cycle, which were substantial ($579,976 as of 10/29/07).\n\nAccording to the Center for Responsive Politics, Kirkland, through its employees, was one of the top law firms contributing to federal candidates during the 2012 election cycle, donating $2.49 million, 59% to Republicans.

Nintendo of America, Inc.\n\nLewis Galoob Toys, Inc. v. Nintendo of America, Inc. (Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, 1992) was a court case which established the rights of users to modify copyrighted works for their own use. The case revolved around whether or not the Game Genie device which could modify video games in real time constituted creating a derivative work.\n\nUnder license from UK company Codemasters, Galoob manufactured an add-on product for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) called Game Genie, which allowed users to modify video games by entering in certain codes; for example, a code might make the player's character invincible by negating the programming that updates the character's health amount.\n\nNintendo, which sold a video game system and video games that could be modified by Game Genie, sued Galoob for copyright infringement, alleging that modifying a game with the Game Genie created a derivative work, violating Nintendo's copyright in their video games.\n\nThe court battle began in May 1990, when Galoob filed a complaint against Nintendo in U.S. District Court, seeking a declaratory judgment that the Game Genie did not violate Nintendo's copyrights, as well as an injunction preventing Nintendo from modifying their NES game system to make it incompatible with the Game Genie. Nintendo responded by filing a complaint against Galoob, seeking an injunction preventing Galoob from selling the Game Genie.\n\nA similar court case (\"Midway Manufacturing Co. v. Artic International, Inc.\") had previously been decided in favor of the copyright holder. Nintendo relied heavily on this case as precedent for its legal arguments.\n\nIn July 1990, the court granted Nintendo a preliminary injunction, preventing Galoob from selling the Game Genie until the court matter was resolved. It also ordered Nintendo to post a bond (initially $100,000, later increased to $15 million), in order to ensure Galoob be compensated for sales lost during the injunction, should Galoob win the case. Galoob appealed the injunction to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, but lost.\n\nAfter over a year of legal wrangling, the trial concluded in July 1991, with District Judge Fern M. Smith ruling in favor of Galoob, declaring that the Game Genie did not violate Nintendo's copyrights. In her ruling, Smith compared usage of the Game Genie to \"skipping portions of a book\" or fast-forwarding through a purchased movie; thus the altered game content did not constitute the creation of a derivative work as Nintendo had argued. Smith wrote that \"Having paid Nintendo a fair return, the consumer may experiment with the product and create new variations of play, for personal enjoyment, without creating a derivative work.\" Nintendo appealed the verdict to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, but lost as the Ninth Circuit affirmed the lower court's decision.\n\nIn December 1991, a hearing was held to determine how much of the $15 million bond would be awarded to Galoob to compensate for losses during the approximately one-year period they were prohibited from selling the Game Genie. The court found that, because Galoob's losses actually exceeded $15 million, Galoob was entitled to the entire amount, plus legal fees. Nintendo appealed this decision to the Ninth Circuit, but lost again.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit referred to the \"Galoob\" ruling in \"Micro Star v. FormGen Inc.\", a case involving user-created levels for the video game Duke Nukem 3D. In that case, Judge Alex Kozinski concluded that the fair use analysis in \"Galoob v. Nintendo\" is dicta, and ruled in favor of the copyright holder.\n\nA 2002 case involving the ClearPlay technology raised a similar issue in the context of home viewing of DVDs. At no point was a copy of the DVD made; rather, offensive parts of the movie were automatically skipped. Hollywood studios and the Directors Guild of America sued ClearPlay alleging copyright infringement and trademark infringement. The case, however, was rendered irrelevant by the passage of the Family Entertainment and Copyright Act of 2005, a law that because of its narrow applicability did not abrogate \"Midway\" or affirm \"Galoob\". (There was no judicial opinion issued in the case because it became moot in light of the new law.)\n\nSonicBlue was sued over the commercial-skipping feature of ReplayTV on similar grounds. \"Your contract when you get the show is you're going to watch the spots [advertisements]. … Any time you skip a commercial … you're actually stealing the programming,\" asserts Turner Broadcasting CEO Jamie Kellner. He admits that \"there's a certain amount of tolerance\" for going to the bathroom during commercials. SonicBlue went bankrupt before the court reached a decision on the merits of the case.\n"}

{"id": "306902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=306902", "title": "Magistrate", "text": "Magistrate\n\nThe term magistrate is used in a variety of systems of governments and laws to refer to a civilian officer who administers the law. In ancient Rome, a \"magistratus\" was one of the highest ranking government officers, and possessed both judicial and executive powers. In other parts of the world, such as China, a magistrate was responsible for administration over a particular geographic area. Today, in some jurisdictions, a magistrate is a judicial officer who hears cases in a lower court, and typically deals with more minor or preliminary matters. In other jurisdictions (e.g., England and Wales), magistrates may be volunteers without formal legal training who perform a judicial role with regard to minor matters.\n\nIn ancient Rome, the word \"magistratus\" referred to one of the highest offices of state. Analogous offices in the local authorities, such as \"municipium\", were subordinate only to the legislature of which they generally were members, \"ex officio\", often a combination of judicial and executive power, constituting one jurisdiction. In Rome itself, the highest magistrates were members of the so-called \"cursus honorum\" -'career of honors'. They held both judicial and executive power within their sphere of responsibility (hence the modern use of the term \"magistrate\" to denote both judicial and executive officers), and also had the power to issue \"ius honorarium\", or magisterial law. The Consul was the highest Roman magistrate. The Praetor (the office was later divided into two, the Urban and Peregrine Praetors) was the highest judge in matters of private law between individual citizens, while the Curule Aediles, who supervised public works in the city, exercised a limited civil jurisdiction in relation to the market. Roman magistrates were not lawyers, but were advised by jurists who were experts in the law.\n\nThe term was maintained in most feudal successor states to the western Roman Empire. However, it was used mainly in Germanic kingdoms, especially in city-states, where the term magistrate was also used as an abstract generic term denoting the highest office, regardless of the formal titles (e.g. Consul, Mayor, Doge), even when that was actually a council. The term \"chief magistrate\" applied to the highest official, in sovereign entities the head of state and/or head of government.\n\nUnder the \"civil law\" systems of European countries, such as Belgium, France, Italy and the Netherlands, \"magistrat\" (French), \"magistrato\" (Italian) and \"magistraat\" (Dutch) are generic terms which comprise both prosecutors and judges, distinguished as the 'standing' versus 'sitting' magistrature, respectively.\n\nIn Portugal, besides being used in the scope of the judiciary to designate prosecutors and judges, the term \"magistrado\" was also used to designate certain government officials, like the former civil governors of district. These were referred as \"administrative magistrates\" to distinguish them from the judiciary magistrates. The President of Portugal is considered the Supreme Magistrate of the Nation.\n\nIn Finland, \"maistraatti\" (the Finnish-language cognate of \"magistrate\", officially translated as \"local register office\") is a state-appointed local administrative office whose responsibilities include keeping population information and public registers, acting as a public notary and conducting civil marriages.\n\nIn Mexico's Federal Law System, a \"magistrado\" (magistrate) is a superior judge (and the highest-ranking State judge), hierarchically beneath the Supreme Court Justices (Ministros de la Corte Suprema).\n\nThe \"magistrado\" reviews the cases seen by a judge in a second term if any of the parties disputes the verdict. For special cases, there are \"magistrados superiores\" (superior magistrates) who review the verdicts of special court and tribunal magistrates.\n\nIn the courts of England and Wales, magistrates—also known as justices of the peace (JPs)—are volunteers who hear prosecutions for and dispose of 'summary offences' and some 'triable-either-way offences' by making orders with regard to and placing additional requirements on offenders. Magistrates/JPs are limited to issuing sentences of no longer than twelve months. Magistrates/JPs have other limitations in their sentencing authority with powers extending to fines, community orders which can include curfews, electronic tagging, requirements to perform unpaid work up to 300 hours, and supervision for up to three years. In more serious cases, magistrates can send 'either-way' offenders to the Crown Court for sentencing when the magistrate feels a penalty should be imposed that is more severe than the magistrate is capable of sentencing.\n\nA wide range of other legal matters is within the remit of magistrates. In the past, magistrates have been responsible for granting licenses to sell alcohol, for instance, but this function is now exercised by local councils; though, there is a right of appeal to the magistrates' court. Magistrates are also responsible for granting search warrants to the police and other authorities; therefore, it used to be a requirement that they live within a radius of the area they preside over (the \"commission area\") in case they are needed to sign a warrant after hours. However, \"commission areas\" were replaced with \"Local Justice Areas\" by the Courts Act 2003, meaning magistrates no longer need to live within ; although, in practice, many still do. Section 7 of the Courts Act 2003 states that \"There shall be a commission of the peace for England and Wales—…b) addressed generally, and not by name, to all such persons as may from time to time hold office as justices of the peace for England and Wales\". Thus, every magistrate in England and Wales may act as a magistrate anywhere in England or Wales.\n\nThere are two types of magistrates in England and Wales: justices of the peace and district judges (formerly known as stipendiary magistrates) who hold office as members of the professional judiciary. According to requirements, around 50% of magistrates are women. Over 41% of magistrates are retired from employment while others may be self-employed or able to arrange leave from their employment.\n\nNo formal qualifications are required, but magistrates require intelligence, common sense, integrity, and the capacity to act fairly. Membership is widely spread throughout the area covered and drawn from all walks of life. Police officers, traffic wardens, and members of the armed forces, as well as their close relatives will not be appointed, nor will those convicted of certain criminal offences including recent minor offences. All magistrates receive three days of training before sitting, carried out in conjunction with a mentoring program (mentors are magistrates with at least three years' service), which covers basic law and procedure. They continue to receive training throughout their judicial career. Additional training is given to magistrates choosing to sit in the Youth Court or those dealing with family matters. New magistrates sit with mentors on at least six occasions during their first eighteen months.\n\nMagistrates are unpaid appointees, but they may receive allowances to cover traveling expenses, subsistence, and loss of earnings for those not paid by their employer while sitting as a magistrate, up to £116.78 a day. A justice of the peace may sit at any magistrates' court in England and Wales, but in practice, they are appointed to their local bench (a colloquial and legal term for the local court) and are provided with advice (especially on sentencing) by a legally qualified Clerk to the Justices. They will normally sit as a panel of three with two as a minimum. Many are members of the Magistrates' Association, which provides advice and training and represents the approximately 28,000 magistrates to the government. The Association also represents magistrates on the Sentencing Guidelines Council.\n\nMembers of the second group are known as District Judges (Magistrates' Courts). Unlike magistrates, District Judges (Magistrates' Courts) sit alone. They are appointed by open competition through a process administered by the JAC and are required to be qualified solicitors, barristers, or chartered legal executives. Some also sit in the family court. Questions have been raised by the Magistrates' Association as to the legal safeguards of a single District Judge allowed to hear a case, decide the outcome, and pass sentence without reference to another party.\n\nIn the courts of Scotland, the office of stipendiary magistrate was established by Section 5 of the District Courts (Scotland) Act 1975, and was replaced by the office of summary sheriff by Section 218 of the Courts Reform (Scotland) Act 2014. In Scotland, the lowest level of law-court, the Justice of the Peace Court, is presided over by a Justice of the Peace. Stipendiary magistrates are, \"ex officio\", justices of the peace, and when sitting in a JP court had the summary criminal jurisdiction and powers of a sheriff.\n\nA Federal Magistrate was an office created on 23 December 1999 along with the establishment of the Federal Magistrates Court by the Australian Government as a result of royal assent of the \"Federal Magistrates Act 1999 (Cth)\". Its first judicial officers were appointed in 2000; it first applications were filed on 23 June 2000 and the Court’s first sittings were conducted on 3 July 2000 in Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne, , Parramatta and Townsville. \n\nThe Federal Magistrates' Court of Australia dealt with more minor Commonwealth law matters which had previously been heard by the Federal Court of Australia (administrative law, bankruptcy, consumer protection, trade practices, human rights, and copyright) or the Family Court (divorce, residence [or custody], and contact with [or access to] the children, property division upon divorce, maintenance, and child support). In some areas, such as bankruptcy and copyright, the court had virtually unlimited jurisdiction.\n\nThe Federal Magistrates would hear shorter or less complex matters or matters in which the monetary sum in disputes does not exceed given amounts. For instance, property divisions where the total assets are A$700,000 or less and consumer law matters (trade practices) where the amount claimed is less than $750,000. The first Chief Federal Magistrate, Diana Bryant left the court in 2004 when she was appointed Chief Justice of the Family Court of Australia, the third person to be appointed that position since the establishment of the Family Court. \n\nEventually, the Federal Magistrates Court assumed a significant part of the workload of the Federal Court and the Family Court. By May 2004, the court was dealing with 73% of the total number of applications made in the three courts (see the Annual Report of the Federal Magistrates' Court 2004/2005). The Federal Magistrates Court was exercising jurisdiction well in excess of that of the state magistrates' courts, and similar to that of the District and County courts of the Australian states. \n\nOn 12 April 2013, in recognition of its increased jurisdiction and its role as an intermediate court servicing regional centres as well as capital cities throughout Australia, the Federal Magistrates Court was renamed the Federal Circuit Court of Australia, the Act renamed as the \"Federal Circuit Court of Australia Act 1999\", and its judicial officers received the title \"Judge\" instead of \"Federal Magistrate\".\n\nThe State Magistrates in Australia derive from the English Magistrates. All Magistrates are salaried officers.\n\nThe jurisdiction of the magistrates varies from state to state. They preside over courts which are, depending on the state, called Magistrates’ Courts, Local Courts, or Courts of Petty Sessions.\n\nMagistrates hear bail applications, motor licensing applications, applications for orders restraining a given individual from approaching a specific person (“intervention orders” or “apprehended violence orders”), summary criminal matters, the least serious indictable criminal matters, and civil matters where the disputed amount does not exceed A$40,000 to A$100,000 (depending on the State).\n\nIn some states, such as Queensland and NSW, the Magistrate may appear robed; although, some Magistrates are known to prefer a business suit. Magistrates presiding in the Koori Court (which deals with Aboriginal defendants) were originally of a mind not to appear robed; however, elders within the Indigenous community urged Magistrates to continue wearing robes to mark the solemnity of the court process to defendants. Robing is being considered for Magistrates in other states; however, neither Counsel nor solicitors appear robed in any Australian Magistrates' court. Robing in summary courts is unlikely to extend to the legal profession.\n\nHistorically, Magistrates in Australia have been referred to as “Your Worship”. (From Old English \"weorthscipe\", meaning being worthy of respect.) However, members of the magistracy are now addressed as \"Your Honour\" in all states. This was partly to recognize the increasing role magistrates play in the administration of justice, but also to recognize the archaic nature of \"Your Worship\", and the tendency for witnesses and defendants to incorrectly use \"Your Honour\" in any event. It is also acceptable to address a magistrate simply as Sir or Madam.\n\nThere are currently seven magistrates' courts in Hong Kong. Magistrates exercise criminal jurisdiction over a wide range of offences. Although there is a general limit of two years' imprisonment or a fine of HK$100,000, certain statutory provisions give Magistrates the power to sentence up to three years' imprisonment and to impose a fine up to HK$5,000,000.\n\nThere are four categories of magistrates in the Judiciary of India. This classification is given in the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 (CrPC). It stipulates that in each sessions district, there shall be:\n\n1.The Chief Judicial Magistrate [CJM] (including Additional Chief Judicial Magistrates.) CJMs hear all types of criminal cases. All magistrates' courts are controlled by the CJM. The CJM looks over the work of judicial magistrates, but cannot take any action against them. The CJM can only report the misbehavior of judicial magistrates to the High Court. A court of Chief Judicial Magistrates can sentence a person to jail up to ten years and impose fines of up to . The CJM is the most senior among all magistrates in their district.\n\n2. There is a Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate (SDJM) in every subdivision. They hear cases related to the Dowry Act, EC Act, and other criminal cases. They also maintain and control the judicial court below them. A court of Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrates may sentence a person to fines of up to ten years and impose fine up to . Judicial magistrates can try criminal cases.\n\n3. A Judicial Magistrate First Class can sentence a person to jail for up to seven years and impose a fine of up to .\n\n4. An Executive Magistrate is an officer of the Executive branch (as opposed to the Judicial branch) who is invested with specific powers under both the CrPC and the Indian Penal Code (IPC). These powers are conferred by Sections 107-110, 133, 144, 145, and 147 of the CrPC. These officers cannot try any accused nor pass verdicts. A person arrested on the orders of a court located outside the local jurisdiction should be produced before an Executive Magistrate who can also set the bail amount for the arrested individual to avoid police custody, depending on the terms of the warrant. The Executive Magistrate also can pass orders restraining persons from committing a particular act or preventing persons from entering an area (Section 144 CrPC). There is no specific provision to order a \"curfew\". The Executive Magistrates alone are authorised to use force against people. In plain language, they alone can disperse an \"unlawful assembly\". Technically, the police are to assist the Executive Magistrate. Executive Magistrates can dictate to the police the manner of force (baton charge/ tear gas/blank fire/firing) and also, how much force should be used. They can also seek the assistance of the Armed Forces to quell a riot.\n\nEach District contains the following Judicial Magistrates:\n\nThere are, in each Administrative District (as opposed to a Sessions District) the following kinds of Executive Magistrates:\nAll the Executive Magistrates of the district, except the ADM, are under the control of the DM.\n\nThese magistrates are normally conferred on the officers of the Revenue Department, although an officer can be appointed exclusively as an Executive Magistrate. Normally, the Collector of the district is appointed as the \"DM\". Similarly, the Sub-Collectors are appointed as the SDMs. Tehsildars and Deputy/Additional Tehsildars are appointed as Executive Magistrates.\n\nUnder the old CrPC, there was no distinction between the Executive and Judicial Magistrates; some states still follow the old CrPC.\n\nAccording to the Code of Criminal Procedure(CrPC),1898; there are two classes of Magistrates in Bangladesh, namely: -\n\n(a) Judicial Magistrate; and\n\n(b) Executive Magistrate.\n\nThere shall be four classes of judicial Magistrate, namely:\n\n(a) Chief Metropolitan Magistrate in Metropolitan Area and Chief judicial Magistrate to other areas\n\n(b) Magistrate of the first class, who shall in Metropolitan area, is known as Metropolitan Magistrate\n\n(c) Magistrate of the second class\n\n(d) Magistrate of the third class\n\nAccording to the section-10(6)of the Code of Criminal Procedure(CrPC)1898, members of Bangladesh Civil Service(Administration) Cadre, who are in the capacity of Assistant Commissioner, Upozila Nirbahi Officer(UNO), and Additional Deputy Commissioner(ADC) shall be Executive Magistrates and may exercise the power of Executive Magistrate within their existing respective local areas. Besides this, according to the provision of the section-10(5) of CrPC,1898; The Government may, if it thinks it expedient or necessary, appoint any persons employed in the Bangladesh Civil Service (Administration) to be an Executive Magistrate and confer the powers of an Executive Magistrate on any such member.\n\nEvery Administrative District has the following Executive Magistrates:\n\n(a) District Magistrate: In every district and in every Metropolitan Area, the Government shall appoint as many persons as it thinks fit to be Executive Magistrates and shall appoint one of them to be the District Magistrate.\n\n(b) Additional District Magistrate (ADM): The Government may also appoint any Executive Magistrate to be an Additional District Magistrate. Additional District Magistrates shall have all or any of the powers of a District Magistrate under this Code or under any other law for the time being in force, as the Government may direct.\n\n(c) Additional Deputy Commissioner (ADC): All the ADC's in the district are Executive Magistrate.\n\n(d) Upazila Nirbahi Officer or Sub-District Executive Officer\n\nThe position of stipendiary magistrate in New Zealand was renamed in 1980 to that of district court judge. The position was often known simply as \"magistrate\", or the postnominal initials SM after a magistrate's name in newspapers' court reports.\n\nIn the late 1990s, a position of community magistrate was created for district courts on a trial basis. Under this system, two community magistrates were initially required to sit to consider a case; some of these community magistrates are still serving.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, a magistrate is a Judicial Officer appointed to preside over a Magistrates' Court to a particular jurisdiction under the \"Judicature Act No 02 of 1978\". The post was formally known as Police Magistrate when, magistrates' courts were known as police magistrate courts. Magistrates have jurisdiction over the criminal cases filed under the penal code. They carryout first mortem and post mortem examinations; issue search warrants; arrest warrants produce suspected persons; and grant bail. In many cases magistrates preside over primary courts Unofficial magistrates can be appointed from among the senior lawyers of the local bar. There are four types of magistrate;\n\n\nMagistrates are somewhat less common in the United States than in Europe, but the position does exist in some state jurisdictions and in federal courts.\n\nThe term \"magistrate\" is often used (chiefly in judicial opinions) as a generic term for any independent judge who is capable of issuing warrants, reviewing arrests, etc. When used in this way, it does not denote a judge with a particular office. Instead, it denotes (somewhat circularly) a judge or judicial officer who is capable of hearing and deciding a particular matter. That capability is defined by State statute or by common law. In Virginia, for example, the Constitution of 1971 created the office of magistrate to replace the use in cities and counties of the justice of the peace, which is common in many states for this function.\n\nAs noted above, the terms \"magistrate\" or \"chief magistrate\" were sometimes used in the early days of the republic to refer to the President of the United States, as in President John Adams's message to the U.S. Senate upon the death of George Washington: \"His example is now complete, and it will teach wisdom and virtue to magistrates, citizens, and men, not only in the present age, but in future generations, as long as our history shall be read\" (December 19, 1799).\n\nIn the United States federal courts, a magistrate judge is a judicial officer authorized by \"et seq.\" They were formerly known as U.S. commissioners, and then as magistrates. Magistrate judges, as they have been designated since 1990, are appointed by the life-term federal district judges of a particular court, serving terms of eight years if full-time, or four years if part-time, and may be reappointed. Magistrate judges conduct a wide range of judicial proceedings to expedite the disposition of the civil and criminal caseloads of the United States district courts. Congress set forth in the statute the powers and responsibilities that could be delegated by district court judges to magistrate judges. To achieve maximum flexibility in meeting the needs of each court, however, Congress left to the individual courts the actual determination of which duties to assign to magistrate judges.\n\nIn many state court systems in the United States, magistrate courts are the successor to Justice of the Peace courts, and frequently have authority to handle the trials of civil cases up to a certain dollar amount at issue, applications for bail, arrest and search warrants, and the adjudication of petty or misdemeanor criminal offences. In Ohio, magistrates are subordinate to the judge or judges who appoint them, and all of their decisions are subject to the review, amendment, approval, or reversal by a judge. In some states, including West Virginia and Georgia, magistrates are elected and not appointed.\n\nMagistrate, or chief magistrate, is also a common translation of the Chinese \"xianzhang\" (县长/縣長 \"literally: county leader\") the political head of a county or \"xiàn\" (县/縣) which ranks in the third level of the administrative hierarchy of China. The translation dates from imperial China in which the county magistrate was the lowest official in the imperial Chinese bureaucracy and had judicial in addition to administrative functions.\n\nIn modern-day China, the county leader is elected by the local people's congress but the process is controlled by the Communist Party. Although there are elections at the lower township level, these elections (with one exception, which was considered irregular and illegal) have not extended up to the county level. County leaders, particularly in rural areas, can affect the lives of ordinary people by enforcing central government regulations or by turning a blind eye to their violation.\n\nIn Switzerland, \"magistrate\" is a designation for the persons holding the most senior executive and judicial offices. On the federal level, the members of the Federal Council, the Federal Chancellor, and the judges on the Federal Supreme Court are called magistrates. The designation of magistrate is not a title or style. It does not, by itself, confer any particular privileges.\n\nIn Taiwan, magistrates are the heads of government of counties. The county magistrate elections are heavily and sometimes bitterly contested, and are often a stepping-stone to higher office. County magistrate elections were first open to election in the 1960s and, before the end of martial law in 1991, were the highest elected position of any real power, and hence, the focus of election campaigns by the Tangwai movement.\n\nIn Kenya, there are five categories of magistrates, namely: Resident Magistrate, Senior Resident Magistrate, Principal Magistrate, Senior Principal Magistrate, and Chief Magistrate. Chief Magistrate is the highest ranking among magistrates and also assumes administrative control of magistrate courts in his or her jurisdiction. A Chief Magistrate has jurisdiction in a dispute that does not exceed seven million Kenya shillings. For Senior Principal Magistrates, the limit is in disputes not exceeding five million Kenya shillings; for Principal Magistrates it is disputes not exceeding four million Kenya shillings. Senior Resident Magistrates have jurisdiction in disputes not exceeding three million Kenya shillings and Resident Magistrates in disputes not exceeding two million Kenya shillings.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The project features Naseeruddin Shah, Sonu Sood, Neha Dhupia and Vinay Pathak in pivotal roles. \"Maximum\" was released on 29 June 2012. After the film's release, the film got mixed reviews, but was a disaster at the box office.\n\n\"Maximum\" revolves around two of Mumbai Police's top encounter specialists and their fight for control. This fight goes through a maze of politics, land deals, fake encounters and bad money. Pundit (Sonu Sood) and Inamdar (Naseeruddin Shah) try to overtake each other for power. Each kill the other's informers and divides the Mumbai police. Inamdar and his superiors frame Pundit and he gets suspended. Pundit comes back into the force with the help of a minister, Tiwari (Vinay Pathak). After the Mumbai bombing Inamdar is removed from his position and Pundit is reinstated. Meanwhile, Tiwari takes responsibility for the elections. One night when he is at home his accomplices are shot. He goes to check and finds the culprit to be Pundit. Pundit shoots Pathak.\n\nIn flashback it is shown that while Pundit is travelling with his wife, Supriya (Neha Dhupia) shots are fired. In the confusion his car falls into a jungle. After that he shoots all the people and says that they were Niranjan's people. But when he comes back he realises that his wife is no more. Then it is revealed that Tiwari had an offer from the Home Ministry and 700 million from Pundit's enemies in exchange for killing Pundit. Instead, his men killed Pundit's wife. That was the reason Pundit shot Tiwari.\n\nBefore dying Tiwari confesses that he should not have done what he did. Pundit asks whether Subodh(his superior) knew of this. Finally Pundit shoots Tiwari.\n\nPundit hands over property documents to a reporter. The reporter tells him that there is no going back once this goes public. Pundit says that he does not want to return. Pundit comes with his daughter and the reporter to leave the city. Meanwhile, Inamdar and his men start shooting at them. Many people from both sides are killed. Meanwhile, the train is about to start. Pundit sends his daughter with his brother and the reporter to catch the train. She is unwilling to leave without him but finally does. An open shootout follows in which both Pundit and Inamdar are shot. A severely injured Pundit runs towards the train to meet his daughter. Before he can do so he is shot by Inamdar. Before dying he manages to shoot Inamdar. Pundit has a last look at his daughter before finally dropping dead.\n\n\nMaximum had a poor opening facing heavy competition from \"The Amazing Spider-Man\". The second week also went poorly, as the much awaited Bol Bachchan released.On the third week,it almost disappeared from cinemas due to release of Cocktail and was declared a disaster grossing only Rs22.5 million.\n\nThe movie was set in Mumbai during 2003. \n\nMaximum garnered mostly negative reviews. Aniruddha Guha of DNA gave it 2 stars (on 5) and wrote – \"Maximum ends up as a 'me too' among many RGV-inspired films in the last few years, even though that may not have been the intention.

The twist in the end is the saving grace of the movie, if we can call it that. Maximum does not deserve your time or money\". Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave it 2.5 out of five stars and said – \"Maximum isn’t a washout – not by a long chalk. It is well crafted and superbly acted.

Writing for Hindustan Times, Anupama Chopra once again gave Maximum 2 stars and commented – \"Maximum has stray moments of power but the film feels like a Ram Gopal Varma rehash; mercifully though there are no cameras zooming into teacups like there were in Varma's recently released Department, which was also about power-hungry, corrupt encounter specialists\".

ASCAP, BMI, SESAC & Pro Music Rights are the four performing rights societies in the U.S. and once they receive payment from the broadcasters they are responsible for compensating the music authors and publisher.\n\nOn February 4, 2009, Congressman John Conyers, Jr. introduced H.R. 848, the Performance Rights Act in the U.S. House of Representatives, 111th Congress. The Bill was referred to the House Judiciary Committee and on December 14, 2010, it was placed on the Union Calendar, Calendar No. 405. Under this Bill's version, performance rights was broadly designed to protect the civil rights of minority, religious, rural, and small communities with components to public access and education.\n\nMusician and civil rights activist, George Clinton has spearheaded the H.R. 848 initiative to preserve, promote and protect a legacy of peace for children through his foundation, Mothers Hip Connection, with public awareness educational campaigns on copyright recapturing and reclaiming royalties for children of civil rights era musical performers.\n\nThe primary provisions governing the performing rights of the copyright owner are given under subsections 4 and 6 of § 106 of the U.S Copyright Act. S.106 lists the exclusive rights held by the owner of copyright and subsections 4, 6 lists out the specific protected works that the owner can publicly perform. Subsection 6 was added in 1996 in order to allow owners of sound recordings the exclusive right to perform their work publicly. Before 1996, the owners of copyright in sound recordings in the United States did not enjoy any rights of public performance but after the amendment a limited right of public performance by means of a digital audio transmission was granted to sound recordings.\n\n§101 of the Act explains that a work is performed when the work is recited, rendered, played, danced, or acted, either directly or by means of any device or process. The definition gets broader in the case of a motion picture or other audiovisual work where a work is performed when its images are shown in any sequence or when the sounds accompanying the work are audible. Due to the very broad definition of \"perform\" virtually every rendition of the copyrighted work would constitute a performance. In addition to the capricious definition, performances of musical compositions and the underlying sound recordings will have to be noted separately. Each time a rendition of some musical work is performed, the sound recording embodying that rendition is also performed, except of course when the musical work was originally created i.e sang into a microphone, because there’s no recording yet. The reason to differentiate between the musical performance and the sound recording is because the copyrights in these things may well be held by different parties and thus be governed by different rules.\n\nIn order to restrict this very wide right, copyright owners only have the right to perform their work publicly i.e private performances are exempted from infringement. Though not providing a specific definition of \"public\" §101 of the Act defines public performance in two ways:\n\nPublic Place Clause :This approach is based on the intuitive meaning of the word 'public'. Under §101, is performance is public when it is made to a gathering of a substantial number of people who are outside the performer's circle of family and friends. So, a restaurant playing a song on its radio, which can be heard by the patrons eating food, would constitute a public performance.\n\nTransmission Clause : A performance is also public when it is transmitted or communicated through any device or process to members of the public regardless of whether the public in question receive the performance in a single place and time, i.e, a transmission received by the public separately and individually would also constitute a public performance. Thus, a radio station transmitting a protected work through airwaves or analog waves or cable companies transmitting the protected works through cable directly into a person's home or any individual broadcasting the work on the internet would constitute a public performance under §101.\n\nIn the case of Cartoon Network, LP v. CSC Holdings, Inc., 536 F.3d 121 (2d Cir. 2008) , a consortium of copyright holders like Turner Broadcasting, 20th Century Fox, Paramount Pictures and Disney along with their subsidiaries sued Cablevision for its \"Remote DVR\" technology which allowed people to pause, record, replay and rewind previously stored content. The plaintiff challenged this new technology on three grounds.\n\n1) That even the brief retention of the slices of the protected work in that the brief retention of slices of each work in the Broadband Media Router buffer infringed on the plaintiff's right to reproduce the work.\n\n2) That the copies saved on the Cablevision hard drive also constituted an infringement on the plaintiff's right to reproduce the work.\n\n3) That the transmission of the copyrighted work from the Cablevision servers to their customers infringes on their right to public performance of the work.\n\nThe Court of appeals reversed the finding of the Trial Court and decided the case in Cablevision's favor. While rejecting the third contention raised by the plaintiff the court assumed for the sake of its argument that Cablevision was indeed responsible for the transmission. The Court observed that even though for the customer the Remote DVR worked the same way a set top DVR does, there exists a crucial difference in the two. Instead of sending signals from the remote to an on-set box, the viewer sends signals from the remote through the cable to the Cablevision servers, which then delivers the program to the subscriber’s home. So the Court believed that the Remote DVR more closely resembles a video-on-demand service, whereby a cable subscriber uses his remote and cable box to request transmission of content, such as a movie, stored on computers at the cable company’s facility. But unlike a video-on-demand service, Remote DVR users can only play content that they previously requested to be recorded. The Court ruled that since each subscriber would necessarily have to make her own unique copy of the work while requesting the work, the transmission of that unique work would only be delivered to one person at a time. If Cablevision transmitted the work to multiple subscribers from the same exact copy, then only would the work infringe upon the right of the owners to publicly perform the work. Thus, the clinching point in the case was the fact that each subscriber had to create their own personal copy of the copyrighted work. This fact was also emphasized by the solicitor general when advising the Supreme Court not to review the decision.\n\nSection 13 of The Copyright Act, 1957 states that a copyright is allowed to exist in the following classes of works - (a) original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works; (b) cinematograph films; and (c) sound recordings.\n\nSection 2(d) of the Act defines the meaning of “author” of the work. According to section 2(d) (ii), the composer shall be the “author” of a musical work. However, sections 2(d)(v) and 2(d)(vi) were added to the Act by virtue of the 1994 amendment, according to which an author shall also be producer of the cinematograph film or sound recording; or “\"the person who causes the work to be created”\" when the literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work is computer-generated.\n\nSection 17 deems the author of a work to be the “first owner” of the underlying copyright, subject to certain exceptions. The crux of these exceptions is that whenever an author creates a work during the course of employment of another, the employer (and not the author) will own the copyright unless there is a contract to the contrary. Section 14 of the Act accords certain rights in respect of owners of copyrighted works – the right of public performance (or communication to the public) being one of them. Section 14(a)(iii) allows the a literary, dramatic or musical work to be performed in public, or communicated to the public. Section 14(c)(ii) confers a similar right of communication to the public for artistic works, while sections 14(d)(iii) and 14(e)(iii) confer this right on cinematograph films and sound recordings respectively.\n\nA recorded song would typically have 3 copyrights. The ‘musical work’ is the musical melody, harmony and rhythm, and the ‘literary work’ is the accompanying lyrics. The composer of the musical work is deemed to be the ‘author’ of the musical work and the person penning the lyrics in deemed to be the ‘author’ of the literary work. The third ‘work’ is the ‘sound recording’ which is created when the musical work and the literary work are recorded onto a fixed medium. The producer responsible for the recording is deemed to be the ‘author’ of the sound recording. Each of these works would be allowed their own separate set of rights (the right of public performance being one of them) under the Copyright Act, regardless of one work being created for another by virtue of an agreement. Therefore, even when a producer has engaged an artist to write a song, the producer’s copyright only extends to the song itself (referred to as a ‘synchronisation right’), and not the underlying lyrics, harmony, melody and rhythm – the rights for which would still vest with the original authors.\n\nSection 13(4) of the Copyright Act recognizes the fact that a ‘sound-recording’ incorporated in a cinematograph film can continue to have an individual copyright, separate and distinct from the copyright in the cinematograph film. Similarly, this provision also recognizes that a musical work and literary work incorporated in a ‘sound-recording’ can have individual copyrights that are distinct from the copyright in the sound recording. Therefore, the law recognizes each category of works as a separate property right that is protected by itself despite being incorporated into another work. Thus, the composer of a musical work or the author of a literary work can continue to maintain copyright in their works despite licensing the same to the producer for the creation of a ‘sound-recording’. The same stands true for a ‘sound recording’ that is incorporated into a cinematograph film.\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court has ignored the ambit of section 13(4) in the past, specifically with regard to public performance. In \"Indian Performing Rights Society v Eastern Indian Motion Pictures Association & Ors\"., it was held that once the author of a lyric or a musical work parts with his portion of his copyright by authorizing a film producer to incorporate it in a cinematographic film, the producer acquires the exclusive right of performing the work in public, without having to secure any further permission of the author of the musical work or lyric. The Court ignored the idea contained in section 13(4), that authors of musical works retain an independent right of public performance even after licensing the same for incorporation in a film. The Court merely relied on the text of section 17, holding that in the absence of a contract to the contrary, the film producers would be exclusive owners of the copyrighted works which were incorporated into their films.\n\nThe Legislature sought to negate the effect of the Court’s judgement by enacting the Copyright (Amendment) Act 2012. As a result of this amendment, the authors would own their rights in the music and lyrics even if they were created for the purpose of a cinematograph film, regardless of anything mentioned in section 17. Once the synchronisation rights in the music have been licensed to the producers of the cinematograph film, the authors continue to own the remaining rights such as the public performance rights in the music and lyrics. These remaining rights too could be licensed away by the authors but the authors would be entitled to certain minimum royalties.\n\nThe 2012 Amendment Act was repealed in January 2018 by the Repealing and Amending (Second) Act, 2017.\n\n\n"}

It presents a continuation of earlier efforts, most directly the Data Protection Directive. It deals with the regulation of a number of important issues such as confidentiality of information, treatment of traffic data, spam and cookies. This Directive has been amended by Directive 2009/136, which introduces several changes, especially in what concerns cookies, that are now subject to prior consent.\n\nThe ePrivacy Regulation (ePR) is estimated to come in effect somewhere in 2019 and will repeal the ePrivacy Directive 2002/58/EC and accompany the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and regulate the requirements for consent to the use of cookies and opt-out options.\n\nThe Electronic Privacy Directive has been drafted specifically to address the requirements of new digital technologies and ease the advance of electronic communications services. The Directive complements the Data Protection Directive and applies to all matters which are not specifically covered by that Directive. In particular, the subject of the Directive is the \"right to privacy in the electronic communication sector\" and free movement of data, communication equipment and services. \n\nThe Directive does not apply to Titles V and VI (Second and Third Pillars constituting the European Union). Likewise, it does not apply to issues concerning public security and defence, state security and criminal law. The interception of data was however covered by the EU Data Retention Directive, prior to its annulment by the Court of Justice of the European Union.\n\nContrary to the Data Protection Directive, which specifically addresses only individuals, Article 1(2) makes it clear that ePrivacy Directive also applies to legal persons.\n\nThe first general obligation in the Directive is to provide security of services. The addressees are providers of electronic communications services. This obligation also includes the duty to inform the subscribers whenever there is a particular risk, such as a virus or other malware attack.\n\nThe second general obligation is for the confidentiality of information to be maintained. The addressees are Member States, who should prohibit listening, tapping, storage or other kinds of interception or surveillance of communication and \"related traffic\", unless the users have given their consent or conditions of Article 15(1) have been fulfilled. \n\nThe directive obliges the providers of services to erase or anonymise the traffic data processed when no longer needed, unless the conditions from Article 15 have been fulfilled. Retention is allowed for billing purposes but only as long as the statute of limitations allows the payment to be lawfully pursued. Data may be retained upon a user's consent for marketing and value-added services. For both previous uses, the data subject must be informed why and for how long the data is being processed.\n\nSubscribers have the right to non-itemised billing. Likewise, the users must be able to opt out of calling-line identification.\n\nWhere data relating to location of users or other traffic can be processed, Article 9 provides that this will only be permitted if such data is anonymised, where users have given consent, or for provision of value-added services. Like in the previous case, users must be informed beforehand of the character of information collected and have the option to opt out.\n\nArticle 13 prohibits the use of email addresses for marketing purposes. The Directive establishes the opt-in regime, where unsolicited emails may be sent only with prior agreement of the recipient. A natural or legal person who initially collects address data in the context of the sale of a product or service, has the right to use it for commercial purposes provided the customers have a prior opportunity to reject such communication where it was initially collected and subsequently. Member States have the obligation to ensure that unsolicited communication will be prohibited, except in circumstances given in Article 13. \n\nTwo categories of emails (or communication in general) will also be excluded from the scope of the prohibition. The first is the exception for existing customer relationships and the second for marketing of similar products and services. \nThe sending of unsolicited text messages, either in the form of SMS messages, push mail messages or any similar format designed for consumer portable devices (mobile phones, PDAs) also falls under the prohibition of Article 13.\n\nThe Directive provision applicable to cookies is Article 5(3). Recital 25 of the Preamble recognises the importance and usefulness of cookies for the functioning of modern Internet and directly relates Article 5(3) to them but Recital 24 also warns of the danger that such instruments may present to privacy. The change in the law does not affect all types of cookies; those that are deemed to be \"strictly necessary for the delivery of a service requested by the user\", such as for example, cookies that track the contents of a user's shopping cart on an online shopping service, are exempted.\n\nThe article is technology neutral, not naming any specific technological means which may be used to store data, but applies to any information that a website causes to be stored in a user's browser. This reflects the EU legislator's desire to leave the regime of the directive open to future technological developments.\n\nThe addressees of the obligation are Member States, who must ensure that the use of electronic communications networks to store information in a visitor's browser is only allowed if the user is provided with \"clear and comprehensive information\", in accordance with the Data Protection Directive, about the purposes of the storage of, or access to, that information; and has given his or her consent. \n\nThe regime so set-up can be described as opt-in, effectively meaning that the consumer must give his or her consent before cookies or any other form of data is stored in their browser. The UK Regulations allow for consent to be signified by future browser settings, which have yet to be introduced but which must be capable of presenting enough information so that a user can give their informed consent and indicating to a target website that consent has been obtained. Initial consent can be carried over into repeated content requests to a website. The Directive does not give any guidelines as to what may constitute an opt-out, but requires that cookies, other than those \"strictly necessary for the delivery of a service requested by the user\" are not to be placed without user consent.\n\nThe directive has been criticised by the software firm Silktide who initially produced a range of tools for web developers who wanted to make sure they were not falling foul of the law, but the company now describes the efforts as \"a tragic waste of time\". Oliver Emberton, who owns Silktide, told the BBC that users who had tried to comply with the law were being penalised more than those who had opted to ignore it.\n\nSilktide created a protest website to highlight the \"ineffective\" rules with a message to the Information Commissioner's Office (the UK body tasked with enforcing the directive) \"Dear ICO, sue us\". \n\nEmberton, quoted on the BBC news website said \"The ICO has the impossible job of policing an unworkable law. [...] The most frustrating thing for website owners has been trying to second guess what the law means, as it changes constantly. A lot of time and money has been wasted accomplishing very little. [...] The idea of this law is a noble one, it's just a shame it was drafted by a team of technically illiterate octogenarians who couldn't find a button on a mouse.\"\n\n"}

The two legal actions differ only in that \"quantum meruit\" is used to recover the reasonable value of \"services\" rendered, while \"quantum valebant\" is used to recover the reasonable value of \"goods\" sold and delivered. This count is considered a type of assumpsit.\n\nThe Supreme Court of California has held:\n\nAlthough such an action is one at law, it is governed by principles of equity. It may be brought 'wherever one person has received money which belongs to another, and which \"in equity and good conscience,\" or in other words, in justice and right, should be returned. . . . The plaintiff's right to recover is governed by principles of equity, although the action is one at law.\n\nAn illustration of a case in which \"quantum valebant\" was allowed is \"In re Monitor Prods. Co.\". In that case, the United States Navy had entered into a contract to buy 160 electronic oscillator units at a specified price. The Navy later decided that it wanted 40 more units. Monitor, the subcontractor, told the Navy's project engineer that it needed substantial price increase for the additional 40 units as well as reimbursement for cost overruns which it was incurring in producing the initial 160 units; otherwise it would have to cease production. No additional formal contract was signed, but the project went ahead and Monitor provided the 200 units. The Navy declined to pay any additional amount, although Monitor insisted that it was induced to incur the additional costs by a representative of the Navy (the project engineer), who appeared to have the authority to commit the Government.\n\nThe Comptroller General of the United States held that\n\nthe courts and our Office have recognized that in appropriate circumstances payment may be made for services rendered on a \"quantum meruit\" basis (the reasonable value of work or labor), or for goods furnished on a \"quantum valebat\" basis (the reasonable value of goods sold and delivered).\n\nAccording to the ruling, the Navy ratified an agreement for the extra units and cost overrun. Therefore, \"Monitor's claim may be paid to the extent that the value of the items furnished exceeds any compensation which Monitor may have received from\" the prime contractor for the work.\n"}

The Court upheld the Criminal Code provision allowing for retroactive DNA samples of prisoners without notice.\n\nDennis Rodgers was a convicted sex offender who was serving his sentence in an Ontario prison. Since Rodgers was sentenced before the enactment of the 1998 \"DNA Identification Act\", his blood sample was not taken upon sentencing to be placed in the national database.

Rodgers challenged the application on the basis that the enabling Code provision violated the rights within Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\nIn a four to three decision the Court upheld the Code provisions. Justice Charron, writing for the majority found that the state's interest in his personal information was sufficient to outweigh Rodger's right to privacy. She noted that the DNA sample is akin to a finger print and will only be used for identification purposes.

{"id": "1115308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1115308", "title": "Rulemaking", "text": "Rulemaking\n\nIn administrative law, rule-making is the process that executive and independent agencies use to create, or \"promulgate\", regulations. In general, legislatures first set broad policy mandates by passing statutes, then agencies create more detailed regulations through \"rulemaking\".\n\nBy bringing detailed scientific and other types of expertise to bear on policy, the rulemaking process has been the means by which some of the most far-reaching government regulations of the 20th century have been created. For example, science-based regulations are critical to modern programs for environmental protection, food safety, and workplace safety. However, the growth in regulations has fueled criticism that the rulemaking process reduces the transparency and accountability of democratic government.\n\nLegislatures rely on rulemaking to add more detailed scientific, economic, or industry expertise to a policy—fleshing out the broader mandates of authorizing legislation. For example, typically a legislature would pass a law mandating the establishment of safe drinking water standards, and then assign an agency to develop the list of contaminants and safe levels through rulemaking.\n\nThe rise of the rulemaking process itself is a matter of political controversy. Many find that obscure and complex rulemaking tends to undercut the democratic ideal of a government that is closely watched by and accountable to its citizens.\n\nAlthough executive agencies are usually charged with executing, not promulgating a regulatory scheme, the breadth and depth of regulation today renders it difficult, if not impossible, for legislatures to specify the details of modern regulatory schemes. As a result, the specification of these details are mostly delegated to agencies for rulemaking.\n\nCommon purposes of rulemaking include:\n\nRulemaking processes are generally designed to ensure that\n\nFor example, a typical U.S. federal rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.§551, \"et seq.\" would contain these steps:\n\nIn the United States when an agency publishes a final rule generally the rule is effective no less than thirty days after the date of publication in the Federal Register. If the agency wants to make the rule effective sooner, it must cite \"good cause\" (persuasive reasons) as to why this is in the public interest. \n\nSignificant rules (defined by Executive Order 12866) and major rules (defined by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act ) are required to have a 60 day delayed effective date. \n\nMost modern rulemaking authorities have a common law tradition or a specific basic law that essentially regulates the regulators, subjecting the rulemaking process to standards of due process, transparency, and public participation.\n\nPrivate rulemaking bodies, such as the Internet Engineering Task Force, Java Community Process, and other technical communities, have adopted similar principles and frameworks to ensure fairness, transparency and thoroughness. While the mechanics vary, these efforts follow the same pattern of an open rulemaking record, public publication of proposals, and an opportunity for public comment on those proposals before they are finalized.\n\nPublic participation requires some official method for the agency to communicate to the public. Generally, agencies produce an official \"gazette,\" or periodical for publishing all rulemaking notice, such as the Federal Register. Once a rule is final, the language of the rule itself (not the supporting analysis or data) is \"codified\" in the official body of regulations, such as the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).\n\nIn essence, the accountability of the rulemaking system assumes that the public actually does take note of all of the notices in the Federal Register, which can run over a hundred pages per day. In practice, many industry or public advocacy lobbyists and lawyers monitor the Federal Register Table of Contents every day by email on behalf of their constituents or clients.\n\nPublic comments are the heart of the public’s ability to participate in the rulemaking process. The agency rulemaking is usually required to consider and publish a written response to all comments. Although high-profile rulemakings may include public hearings, most rulemakings are simply noticed in the Federal Register with a call for written comments by a set deadline.\n\nHolding agencies accountable for objective, fact-based rulemaking requires maintaining a formal record of the facts and analysis behind the rule. Agencies must assemble and make public a \"rulemaking record\" that includes all information considered as part of the rulemaking process. \n\nThese records can be enormous and can easily fill scores to hundreds of boxes. Interested parties generally must travel to an agency repository to inspect and copy this record. In the United States the Federal government is moving toward posting rulemaking dockets on-line at www.regulations.gov. Supporting documentation for 37% of new rulemakings was available on-line as of August 2006. By August 2007 it was available for 80% of new rulemakings. Interested parties frequently comb through the agency’s own data to find flaws in the agency’s reasoning. Also, interested parties’ comments on the rule then become part of this record.\n\nIn the U.S., interested parties can sue to have a judge review the rulemaking process once the rule is finalized. Interested parties frequently sue the rulemaking agency, asking the court to order the agency to reconsider. For example, environmental groups may sue, claiming that the rule is too lax on industry; or industry groups may sue, claiming that the rule is too onerous.\n\nTraditionally, courts are reluctant to step into the shoes of the technical experts and re-open the decisions made in the agency’s detailed analysis. However, courts do review whether a rulemaking meets the standards for the rulemaking process. The basis of this review by the courts may be limited to certain questions of fairness or the procedures that ensure that both sides of a dispute are treated equally before any decision making occurs or that the decision is not patently unreasonable (under Canadian law) or Wednesbury unreasonableness (under British law) or similar doctrines described below.\n\nThese powers of review of administrative decision, while often governed by statute, were originally developed out of the royal prerogative writs of English law such as the writ of mandamus and the writ of certiorari.\n\nThus, it is not enough to simply claim that the rulemaking agency could have done a better job. Instead, under U.S. administrative law, to ask the court to order changes in a rule, a party must argue that the rule is:\n\nArbitrary and capricious and/or unsupported by the record. Most frequently, objectors will argue that, even if the judge is not an expert, the judge can tell that there is an obvious gap in the agency’s data or analysis. A court may intervene if it finds that there is no reasonable way that the agency could have drafted the rule, given the evidence in the rulemaking record. A court may send a rule back to the agency for further analysis, generally leaving the agency to decide whether to change the rule to match the existing record or to amend the record to show how they arrived at the original rule. If a court does remand a rule back to the agency, it almost always involves an additional notice and public comment period.\n\nExceeds statutory authority. Frequently, opponents of a rule argue that it fails to follow the instructions of the authorizing legislation. Rules can be found to exceed statutory authority if they are too strict or too lax. If a law instructs an agency to issue regulations to ban a chemical, but the agency issues a rule that instead sets levels for safe use—or vice versa—a court may order the agency to issue a new rule.\n\nBolt out of the blue. Occasionally, interested parties argue that the final rule contains provisions that were never vetted during the public comment period. A court may intervene if it finds that there was no way that the commenting public could have anticipated the new provisions and provided comment. If so, the new provisions are said to be, in a colorful legal phrase, a 'bolt out of the blue' rather than a reasonable course correction during the rulemaking process. Frequently, agencies will vet several options during the proposed rule phase to allow for comment on the full spectrum of rules under consideration.\n\n\n"}

Leon Sullivan, promoting corporate social responsibility:\n\nIn 1977, Rev. Leon Sullivan, an African-American minister, was a member of the board of General Motors. At the time, General Motors was one of the largest corporations in the United States. General Motors also happened to be the largest employer of blacks in South Africa, a country which was pursuing a harsh program of state-sanctioned racial segregation and discrimination targeted primarily at the country's black population.\n\nSullivan, looking back on his anti-Apartheid efforts, recalled:\n\nStarting with the work place, I tightened the screws step by step and raised the bar step by step. Eventually I got to the point where I said that companies must practice corporate civil disobedience against the laws and I threatened South Africa and said in two years Mandela must be freed, apartheid must end, and blacks must vote or else I'll bring every American company I can out of South Africa.\n\nThe Sullivan principles, introduced in 1977 with one addition in 1984, consisted of seven requirements a corporation was to demand for its employees as a condition for doing business. In general, the principles demanded the equal treatment of employees regardless of their race both within and outside of the workplace, demands which directly conflicted with the official South African policies of racial segregation and unequal rights.\n\nThe principles read:\nThe Sullivan principles were celebrated when introduced and gained wide use in the United States, particularly during the disinvestment campaign of the 1980s. Before the end of South Africa's apartheid era, the principles were formally adopted by more than 125 US corporations that had operations in South Africa. Of those companies that formally adopted the principles, at least 100 completely withdrew their existing operations from South Africa.\n\nHowever, as South Africa's system of apartheid persisted relatively unchanged from the 1970s into the late 1980s, Sullivan \"abandoned [his principles] as not going far enough\" complaining that the principles by themselves were not enough to pressure a South African government steadfast in its refusal to yield to change.\n\nIn 1999, more than 20 years after the adoption of the original Sullivan Principles and six years after the end of apartheid, the Rev. Leon Sullivan and United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan together unveiled the new \"Global Sullivan Principles\".\n\nThe overarching objective of these principles, according to Leon Sullivan, is \"to support economic, social and political justice by companies where they do business,\" including respect for human rights and equal work opportunities for all peoples.\n\nIn general, the expanded corporate code of conduct requires adopting multinational companies to be a full participant in the advancement of human rights and social justice internationally.\n\nThe new principles read:\n"}

The films are based on a future dystopian America, where all crime is made legal once a year. The concept was created by James DeMonaco, who also directed the first three films, wrote all the movies, and has written the first episode of the television series so far.\n\n\"The Purge\" series has received a generally mixed critical reception, and has grossed over $447 million in the worldwide box office against a combined budget of $35 million.\n\nThe Purge stars Ethan Hawke, Lena Headey, Max Burkholder, Adelaide Kane, Edwin Hodge, Tony Oller, Rhys Wakefield and Arija Bareikis.\n\nAn affluent Los Angeles neighborhood is home to the Sandin family. On Purge night 2022, the family becomes a target of a masked gang of young criminals due to their actions in helping a wounded stranger being targeted by Purgers to take shelter in their home. The sadistic gang leader unmasks himself to threaten the family via the cameras that they would be murdered if they don't surrender the man within an hour. The stranger later helps the Sandins when the purging gang and the hateful neighbors invade the household and attempt to kill them.\n\nDespite mixed reviews, the film grossed $89.3 million during its run, far surpassing its $3 million budget. The film was turned into a scare zone in 2014 for Universal Parks & Resorts annual Halloween Horror Nights due to its success.\n\nThe Purge: Anarchy, released worldwide on July 18, 2014, stars Frank Grillo, Carmen Ejogo, Zach Gilford, Kiele Sanchez, Zoë Soul and Michael K. Williams while Edwin Hodge reprises his role of \"The Stranger\" from the first movie. Unlike the first Purge film, which was set entirely in one house during the carnage, \"Anarchy\" takes viewers out to the Los Angeles area and shows more of what happens to the surroundings during the Purge.\n\nOff-duty Los Angeles Police Department sergeant Leo Barnes purges to avenge his son's death and becomes the protector of a married couple whose car breaks down on the Purge's commencement and a working-class mother and daughter who are kidnapped from their home. The wounded stranger from the first film is the partner of Carmelo Johns, leader of an anti-Purge resistance group that hacks into TV programs to broadcast messages challenging the system, stating that the Purge does not cleanse aggression, but rather eliminates the poor.\n\nThe film was met with generally mixed reviews, though many critics agreed it was a large improvement over the first film, and was a box office success, grossing $111.9 million compared to its $9 million budget.\n\nThe third film was released on July 1, 2016 in which Frank Grillo and Edwin Hodge reprise their roles from the previous film, and are joined by Elizabeth Mitchell, who plays Senator Charlie Roan. On October 6, it was announced that James DeMonaco would be back for the third film to write and direct, while producers Sébastien K. Lemercier, Blumhouse Productions' Jason Blum, and Platinum Dunes partners Michael Bay, Brad Fuller, and Andrew Form would also be back. Shooting began on September 16 in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. Edwin Hodge and Frank Grillo reprise their roles from the previous film.\n\nLAPD sergeant Leo Barnes is the chief of security for U.S. Senator and leading U.S. presidential candidate Charlie Roan, who vows to end the Purge, having witnessed the death of her family 18 years ago, during the events of the first film. In a bid to prevent this from happening, The New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA) takes the unprecedented step of abolishing the protection afforded to government officials of ranking 10, allowing the U.S. public to target all government officials for the first time since the purge's creation. After a betrayal within the government targets her for death minutes after the Purge's commencement, Barnes must protect Roan while on the run for safety until they meet and form an alliance with some of her supporters; two shopkeepers, an EMT, and an anti-Purge rebel team headed by the wounded Stranger from the first two films, whose real name is Dante Bishop. The group are also aided by the notorious Crips gang to avoid an NFFA-loyal neo-Nazi/white supremacist paramilitary team from capturing the senator. Meanwhile, the NFFA candidate and Roan's rival, Minister Edwidge Owens, who has been set up as a candidate to maintain the status quo, leads the NFFA in committing more acts of violence during Purge night as rebels try to protect more citizens.\n\nIn September 2016, James DeMonaco, who wrote and directed every film in the series thus far, stated that the fourth film would be a prequel to the trilogy. The film shows how the United States got to the point of accepting the Purge.\n\nIn February 2017, DeMonaco announced that a fourth installment was in development. DeMonaco returned to write the script, while Jason Blum, Michael Bay, Brad Fuller, and Andrew Form returning to produce the film with Sébastien K. Lemercier. In July 2017 it was announced that Gerard McMurray was signed to direct the film, and shooting began in September 2017 in Buffalo, New York. The film was released on July 4, 2018.\n\nIn an interview with \"Scream\", \"The Purge\" television series show runner Thomas Kelly stated that a heist film set on Purge Night has been considered.\n\nA television series about the formation of the Purge is also hinted by DeMonaco. The series would possibly deal with how the New Founding Fathers were voted to office after overthrowing the U.S. Government during an economic collapse and social unrest and how they came up with the idea of the Purge. In May 2017, it was reported that Syfy and USA Network will premiere the series in 2018. On February 26, 2018, it was announced that Gabriel Chavarria and Jessica Garza were cast as the leads in the upcoming series. Chavarria will portray Miguel, a US Marine who returns home on Purge Night after receiving a cryptic message from his sister, Penelope portrayed by Garza belonging to a Purge worshipping cult and has pledged to become a sacrifice at the will of their charismatic leader forcing Miguel to face the senseless violence on the streets alone in order to protect those he loves most – his family. The series premiered on September 4, 2018. On November 6, 2018, USA Network renewed the show for a second season.\n\nIn 2014, following an economic collapse and rising social unrest, a political organization named \"The New Founding Fathers of America\" (NFFA) is formed, overthrows the government, and is voted into office. The organization establishes a new totalitarian government and a police state. In 2016, the NFFA devises a plan to help stabilize American society and later in 2017, the 28th Amendment to the U.S Constitution is ratified. This amendment establishes a 12-hour event known as \"The Purge\" which would take place from 7:00 in the evening of March 21 to 7:00 in the morning of March 22, wherein all crime including murder becomes legal. Before the Purge begins, the Emergency Broadcast System is activated with rules and a prayer saying \"Blessed be our New Founding Fathers and America, a nation reborn\" before ending with \"May God be with you all\".\n\nThe rules for the annual Purge are as follows:\n\nBelow is how the Emergency Broadcast System announces the Purge' commencement in the first two films:\n\nIn \"\" (taking place 20 years after the establishment of The Purge), the rule granting immunity to ranking 10 officials is revoked by the NFFA in order to assassinate Roan, a lawyer-turned-senator who has achieved parity in the polls with the NFFA candidate. This was done to prevent her from overturning the 28th Amendment. The line \"And for the first time since its inception, no one has been granted special immunity from the Purge. No citizen or group will be exempt\" was added to the emergency broadcast in this film.\n\nThe final Purge's commencement is announced on the Emergency Broadcast System as follows:\n\nWithin the film series, the Purge has resulted in crime and unemployment rates plummeting to 1% and a strong economy. Although it is thought to be used as an act of catharsis for the U.S. populace, it is actually used as a method of artificial population control, as the unemployed poor in slum neighborhoods as well as some working-class people are usually the main targets; in \"Election Year\", a character notes that sneaking up on a black man on Purge night is a particularly foolish action, suggesting that black people are used to being targets on this night.\n\n\n"}

Under the totality of the circumstances test, courts focus \"on all the circumstances of a particular case, rather than any one factor\". In the United States, totality tests are used as a method of analysis in several different areas of the law. For example, in United States criminal law, a determination about reasonable suspicion or probable cause is based on a consideration of the totality of the circumstances.\n\nCathy E. Moore described the totality of the circumstances test as a \"balancing approach\" rather than a strict application of \"analytical and evidentiary rules\", and Michael Coenen wrote that a totality of the circumstances test is the \"antithesis\" of an \"inflexible checklist\". Likewise, Kit Kinports has described the totality of the circumstances test as an analytical framework where decision makers are not bound by \"rigid\" rules, but instead are free to consider a range of evidence when making decisions. John Barker Waite also contrasted the totality of the circumstances test against rigid rules; he wrote that a judge's determination about a defendant's guilt will always be based on their reactions \"to the totality of the circumstances\", and the basis for such determinations cannot be \"reduced to rule\".\n\nAs early as 1937, the Supreme Court of the United States held that a totality test should be used to determine whether an individual qualifies as a \"farmer\" under United States bankruptcy law. In its 1983 decision in \"Illinois v. Gates\", the Supreme Court held that the totality of the circumstances test should be used to assess whether an anonymous tip is sufficient to provide probable cause. Writing for a majority of the Court, Justice William Rehnquist explained that a totality test was superior to a bright line rule because magistrates would not be \"restricted in their authority to make probable cause determinations\". In its 2013 ruling in \"Florida v. Harris\", the Supreme Court affirmed that \"lower court judges must reject rigid rules, bright-line\ntests, and mechanistic inquiries in favor of a more flexible, all-things-considered approach.\" However, some scholars have suggested that the Supreme Court's recent rulings in \"Florida v. Harris\" and \"Prado Navarette v. California\" represent a departure from the Court's prior totality test jurisprudence by introducing \"drug-dog and drunk-driving exceptions to the totality-of-the-circumstances approach.\"\n\n"}

While some voltage 'optimisation' devices have a fixed voltage adjustment, others electronically regulate the voltage automatically.\n\nVoltage optimisation systems are typically installed in series with the mains electrical supply to a building, allowing all its electrical equipment to benefit from an optimised supply.\n\nVoltage optimisation is an electrical energy saving technique which is mainly installed in series with the mains electricity supply to provide a reduced supply voltage for the site's equipment. Typically, voltage optimisation can improve power quality by balancing phase voltages and filtering harmonics and transients from the supply, although not always. Voltage optimisers are essentially transformers used to deliver power at a reduced voltage from the raw mains supply.\n\nThe term voltage optimisation is frequently misused, as the term implies some form of selective voltage reduction, which will improve the energy consumption within a building, whereas generally these units consists of a transformer within a box, offering no selectivity and dropping voltage on all supplies, whether this would offer a commercial benefit or not. Some VO units have been installed on high frequency lighting circuits, offering little or no commercial benefit, therefore one must be careful when the term is used.\n\nMost VO units are installed in commercial premises, in between the raw mains transformer and main low voltage distribution board. However, this provides for no selectivity and in electrical engineering terms is considered a poor solution. A full study should be undertaken by the facilities manager and VO company, to select which supplies could benefit the owner by reducing the voltage and which supplies would give no commercial benefit. This way the owner only purchases a VO of the correct size and not one that's for all supplies. Installing a VO unit to 'optimise' all supplies would give a longer return on investment, a higher capital outlay and makes little commercial sense.\n\nThe declared low voltage electricity supply in the United Kingdom as per the Electrical Safety, Quality and Continuity Regulations 2002, is now 230 V with a tolerance of +10% to -6%. This means that supply voltage can theoretically be anywhere between 216V and 253V depending on local conditions. However, the average voltage supplied from the national grid (in mainland UK) is 242V, compared to the nominal European voltage of 230 V. (The average supply voltage in Northern Ireland is around 239 V, and 235 V in the Republic of Ireland.)\n\nOlder electrical equipment manufactured for the UK was rated at 240 V, and older equipment manufactured for Continental Europe was rated at 220 V (see Worldwide Mains Voltages). New equipment should be designed for 230 V. A mixture of equipment is likely to be found in older premises. All equipment placed on the market within the E.U. since voltage harmonisation in 1995 should operate satisfactorily at voltages within the range 230 V +/-10%. Equipment rated at 220 V should operate satisfactorily down to 200 V. By efficiently bringing supply voltages to the lower end of the statutory voltage range, voltage optimisation technology could yield average energy savings of around 13% .\n\nThe higher the voltage the higher the power consumption in the case of a pure resistance load. A reduction in voltage does not affect the energy used by the domestic appliances which use resistive loads except in devices such as kettles and toasters which will take longer to do their job due to atmospheric losses. The main commercial benefit when installing VO units, is on inductive loads, like motors which run pumps, fans and the like. In the home, the potential energy saving can be up to 12% on electricity bills. A VO device will lower the voltage to the most efficient level to maximise the savings on electricity consumption, so you may notice certain things taking a little longer, such as a kettle may take a little longer to boil.\n\nIt is a common misconception that fridges and freezers do not provide savings through voltage optimisation because they are fitted with a thermostat. Fridges and freezers operate completely differently from resistive heating devices. If a resistive heating device is driven from a higher voltage the result is heat which is helpful in its intended purpose (heating). If a fridge or freezer is driven from a higher voltage the result is also heat however this is not helpful in its intended purpose (cooling). The compressor motor power output is reduced slightly by voltage optimisation so the fridge/freezer thermostat will keep the motor on a little longer however overall the effect is for the motor to run slightly longer at much lower losses. Tests at Manchester university showed a 10 °C reduction in motor temperature under voltage optimisation due to the reduced losses in the motor. \n\nOvervoltage refers to voltage higher than the voltage at which equipment is designed to operate most effectively. It can cause a reduction in equipment lifetime and increases in energy consumed with no improvement in performance. A commentary on the Wiring Regulations BS 7671 makes the following statements in relation to overvoltage:\n“A 230 V rated lamp used at 240 will achieve only 55% of its rated life” (referring to incandescent lamps) and\n“A 230 V linear appliance used on a 240 V supply will take 4.3% more current and will consume almost 9% more energy.”\n\nVarious technologies can be used to avoid overvoltage, but it must be done so efficiently so that energy savings resulting from using the correct voltage are not offset by energy wasted within the device used to do so. Reliability is also important, and there are potential problems inherent in running full incoming power through electro-mechanical devices such as servo-controlled variable autotransformers.\n\nUndervoltage refers to voltage lower than the voltage at which equipment is designed to operate most effectively. If the design of the VO does not take into consideration voltage drop over distance to remote power users, then this may lead to premature equipment failure, failure to start up, increased temperature in the case of motor windings and loss of service.\n\nHarmonics are current and voltage waveforms at multiples of the fundamental frequency of the 50 Hz (or 60 Hz) main supply. Harmonics are caused by non-linear loads, which include power supplies for computer equipment, variable speed drives, and discharge lighting. “Triplen” harmonics (odd multiples of the third harmonic) result when phase voltages are not balanced in a three phase power systems and add in the neutral, causing wasteful currents to flow.\n\nThe possible effects if the level of harmonics, known as total harmonic distortion becomes too high include damage to sensitive electronic equipment and reduction in the efficiency of the HV transformer. The efficiency of electrical loads can be improved by attenuating harmonics at the supply, or by preventing their generation. Some voltage optimisation devices also mitigate harmonics, reducing losses associated with harmonic content on the electrical system.\n\nTransients are large, very brief and potentially destructive increases in voltage. Their causes include lightning strikes, switching of large electrical loads such as motors, transformers and electrical drives, and by switching between power generation sources to balance supply and demand. Although they typically only last thousandths or millionths of a second, transients can damage electronic systems causing data loss, degrading equipment components and shortening equipment life. Some voltage optimisation devices include transient protection.\n\nIndustrial and commercial sites are supplied with 3-phase electricity. Imbalance between the phases causes problems such as heating in motors and existing wiring, leading to wasteful energy consumption. Some voltage optimisation devices are able to improve balance on the building's electrical supply, reducing losses and improving the longevity of three phase induction motors.\n\nPower dips are reductions in voltage, mostly of short duration (<300 ms) but sometimes longer. They may cause a number of problems with equipment, for example contactors and relays may drop out causing machinery to stop. There are a number of low voltage ride through techniques including Uninterruptible Power Supplies, the use of capacitors on low voltage DC control circuits, the use of capacitors on the DC bus of Variable Speed Drives. Care must be taken that Voltage Optimisation measures do not reduce the voltage to an extent that equipment is more vulnerable to power dips.\n\nThe power factor of an electrical supply is the ratio of the real power to the apparent power of the supply. It is the useful power used by the site divided by the total power that is drawn. The latter includes power that is unusable, so a power factor of 1 is desirable. A low power factor would mean that the electricity supplier would effectively supply more energy than the consumer’s bill would indicate, and suppliers are allowed to charge for low power factors.\n\nReactive power is the name given to unusable power. It does no work in the electrical system, but is used to charge capacitors or produce a magnetic field around the field of an inductor. Reactive power needs to be generated and distributed through a circuit to provide sufficient real power to enable processes to run.\nReactive power increases significantly with increasing voltage as the reactance of equipment increases. Correcting this with voltage optimisation will therefore lead to a reduction in reactive power and improvement in power factor.\n\nA common misconception as far as Voltage Optimisation is concerned is to assume that a reduction in voltage will result in an increase in current and therefore constant power. Whilst this is true for certain fixed-power loads, most sites have a diversity of loads that will benefit to a greater or lesser extent with energy savings aggregating across a site as a whole. The benefit to typical equipment at three phase sites is discussed below.\n\nThree phase induction motors are probably the most common type of three phase load and are used in a variety of equipment including refrigeration, pumps, air conditioning, conveyor drives as well as their more obvious applications. The de-rating effects of overvoltage and three phase imbalance on AC motors are well known. Excessive overvoltage results in saturation of the iron core, wasting energy through eddy currents and increased hysteresis losses. Drawing excessive current results in excess heat output due to copper losses. The additional stress of overvoltage on motors will decrease motor lifetime.\n\nAvoiding overvoltage high enough to cause saturation does not reduce efficiency so substantial energy savings can be made through reducing iron and copper losses. However, motors designed for the nominal voltage (e.g. 400 V) should be able to cope with normal variation in voltage within the supply limits(+/-10%) without saturation, so this is unlikely to be a significant problem.\n\nReducing voltage to an induction motor will slightly affect the motor speed as slip will increase, but speed is mainly a function of the supply frequency and the number of poles. Motor efficiency is optimum at reasonable load (typically 75%) and at the designed voltage, and will fall off slightly with small variations either side of this voltage. Larger variations affect efficiency more.\n\nVery lightly loaded motors (<25%) and small motors benefit most from reducing voltage.\n\nFor the case of motors driven by Variable Speed Drives, when the input voltage is reduced, there will be a proportionate reduction of the output voltage from the VSD and the motor will draw less current and eventually consume less power. However, if the motor is running on high load (>80%), the reduction in voltage will result in reduced torque and motor will end up drawing more current and power.\n\nWhen lighting loads are in use for a high proportion of the time, energy savings on lighting equipment are extremely valuable. When voltage is reduced, incandescent lighting will see a large decrease in power drawn, a large decrease in light output and an increase in lifetime, as the previous extracts from the Electricians Guide illustrate. Since the decrease in light output will exceed the decrease in power drawn, the energy efficiency - luminous efficacy - of the lighting will drop.\n\nHowever, other types of lighting can also benefit from improved power quality, including systems with resistive or reactive ballasts. Fluorescent & discharge lighting is more efficient than incandescent lighting. Fluorescent lighting with conventional magnetic ballasts will see a reduced power consumption, but also a reduced lumen output from the lamp. Fluorescent lamps on modern electronic ballasts will use approximately the same power and give the same light.\n\nTo provide the same wattage at the reduced voltage will require a greater current and increase cable losses. However, lighting controllers and ballasts are responsible for generating high levels of harmonic distortion, which can be filtered with some types of voltage optimiser, in addition reducing the need for lighting controllers.\nA common concern is that some lighting will fail to strike at lower voltages. However, this should not occur since the aim of voltage optimisation is not simply to reduce the voltage as far as possible, but to bring it to the service level voltage at which it was designed to operate most efficiently.\n\nHeaters will consume less power, but give less heat. Thermostatically controlled space or water heaters will consume less power while running, but will have to run for longer in each hour to produce the required output, resulting in no saving.\n\nSwitched mode power supplies will use the same power as before, but will draw a slightly greater current to achieve this, with slightly increased cable losses, and slight risk of the increased current tripping MCBs.\n\nThe energy savings achieved by Voltage Optimization are an aggregation of the improved efficiency of all equipment across a site in response to the improvements in the power quality problems outlined above. It possible technique for savings in energy consumption in certain circumstances.\n\nResearch in Taiwan suggested that, for an industrial supply, for voltage reduction upstream of the transformer, there is a 0.241% decrease of energy consumption when the voltage is decreased by 1%, and an increase of 0.297% when the voltage is increased by 1%. This assumed a mixture of loads including 7% fluorescent lighting, 0.5% incandescent lighting, 12.5% three phase air conditioners, 5% motors, 22.5% small 3-phase motors, 52.5% large 3-phase motors.\n\nIt is likely that a modern installation would have less opportunity: almost no incandescent lighting, partly high-frequency fluorescent lighting (no saving), some variable speed drives (no saving), higher motor efficiencies (so less waste to save). A northern European installation would not have the large number of small single phase motors for air conditioning.\n\nEnergy saving is possible with older lighting, at the expense of lower light output, (e.g. incandescent or fluorescent and discharge lighting with inefficient ballast or control gear). Therefore, older commercial and office premises may save more than modern buildings or industrial sites. However modern lighting systems (typically LED) will save significantly more energy due to higher efficiency than energy saved on older lighting systems following installation of a voltage optimiser.\n\nObtaining energy savings with a voltage optimiser used with modern lighting systems is very questionable. Modern electronic switching controllers for LED or fluorescent lighting systems are designed to run the lights at optimal light output and longevity with high efficiency. Variations in supply voltage will therefore not make any difference to the overall energy use of these types of lights. However there exist types of low cost LED and fluorescent lamp controllers which reduce the voltage by shedding energy as heat (e.g. multiple LEDs in series with a series resistance). Varying the supply voltage would affect the energy used by these types of lights, but these type of lamps are generally low power and the light output would also be affected.\n\nA typical 100 Watt incandescent lamp has an efficiency of no more than 17.5 lumens per Watt (l/W) and will therefore produce 1750 lumens at its rated voltage. A typical modern LED lamp has an efficiency of about 150 lumens per Watt, and therefore requires no more than 12 Watts for the same light output. According to Lamp rerating formulae, reducing the voltage across an incandescent lamp by 10% reduces the power (and therefore energy) by about 16% and reduces the light output by about 31%.\n\nTherefore, a voltage optimiser that reduces the voltage on an incandescent lamp by 10%, will reduce the energy by 16% and light output by 31%, producing only 1210 lumens and consuming 84 Watts. Changing the incandescent lamp to an LED lamp with similar light output would have reduce the consumption more effectively, down to 12 Watts. Furthermore, since the light output is reduced by so much, higher savings could be made by changing to a 75 Watt incandescent lamp without a voltage optimiser (1312.5 lumens assuming 17.5 l/W). The LED lamp could also be reduced in size to 8W, if only 1210 lumens is required.\n\n"}

The defendant Wright had been contracted by the Postmaster to maintain the coach in a safe state. The coach collapsed while Winterbottom was driving and he was injured. He claimed that Wright had \"negligently conducted himself, and so utterly disregarded his aforesaid contract and so wholly and negligently failed to perform his duty in this behalf.\"\n\nIn \"Winterbottom v. Wright\", the court held that the plaintiff had no redress. The principle of \"Winterbottom\" meant that consumers who were injured by defective products in the 19th century had no legal action against the defective execution of a contract to which they were not expressly privy.\n\nIn 1842, the law’s only recognition of \"negligence\" was in respect of a breach of contract. As the plaintiff was not in a contract with the defendant the court ruled in favour of the defendant on the basis of the doctrine of privity of contract.\n\nWinterbottom sought to extend the \"ratio\" of the court in \"Langridge v Levy\" but the court rejected this on the grounds that that case involved a gun whose safety had been misrepresented by the vendor.\n\nThe case was also possibly influenced by public policy. If the plaintiff were able to sue “there would be unlimited actions” and the public utility of the Postmaster-General was such that allowing such actions would be undesirable for society.\n\nThough Master of the Rolls William Brett sought to establish a general principle of duty of care in \"Heaven v. Pender\" (1883), his judgment was at variance with the majority of the court. The privity argument was subsequently rejected in common law in the U.S. in \"MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.\" (1916) and finally in England by the doctrine of the \"neighbour principle\" in \"Donoghue v. Stevenson\" (1932). This evolution is explained in the article on common law.\n\n"}
