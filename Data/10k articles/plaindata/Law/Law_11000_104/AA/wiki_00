Business courts (or more accurately business programs or divisions within existing trial level courts) have been established and are operating in New York City, Chicago, North Carolina, New Jersey, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Reno and Las Vegas, Nevada, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Maryland, Orlando, Miami, Ft. Lauderdale, and Tampa, Florida, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Cleveland, Toledo, and Cincinnati, Ohio, Iowa, Jefferson County, Alabama, Maine, New Hampshire, Atlanta and Gwinnett County, Georgia, Colorado's 4th Judicial District, Delaware's Superior Court, and South Carolina. In New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and New Jersey, the original business programs have been expanded by adding additional judges and/or by expanding into additional counties.\n\nDelaware's Court of Chancery, the nation's pre-eminent court addressing intra-business disputes, has functioned as a business court of limited jurisdiction for a century. However, its traditional equity jurisdiction has evolved and expanded since 2003 to include technology disputes (10 Del. C. § 346), some purely monetary commercial disputes (10 Del. C. § 347), and to expand its role in the alternative dispute resolution of business and commercial disputes. This includes the use of mediation (10 Del. C. § 347), arbitration (10 Del. C. § 349), Masters in Chancery to adjudicate matters (10 Del. C. § 350), and agreements to make decisions non-appealable (10 Del. C. § 351).\n\nThe significant relationship between business courts and ADR is well recognized.\n\nBusiness and Commercial Courts exist internationally as well, including, for example, the United Kingdom, Toronto, Canada, Ireland, Scotland, Copenhagen, Denmark, Hong Kong, Belgium, Bermuda, New South Wales and Victoria Australia, Northern Ireland, Qatar, Dubai, Spain, France, Switzerland, Tanzania, Rwanda, Lesotho, the British Virgin Islands, and Malaysia.\n\nThe American College of Business Court Judges was established in 2005.\n\nBusiness Courts are trial courts that hear business disputes primarily or exclusively. In the United States, these courts have been established in approximately twenty states. In some cases, a state legislature may choose to create a business court by statute. In other cases, business courts have been established by judicial rule or order, at the Supreme Court or trial court level. In all cases, the jurisdiction of the court to hear certain cases is limited to disputes that are in some way related to \"business\" disputes, and generally fall into two categories: (1) those courts which require that cases have an additional complexity component; and (2) those courts which establish jurisdictional parameters (i) through a defined list of case types (ii) combined with a specified minimum amount of damages in controversy, irrespective of complexity. There are courts with mixed models as well.\n\nIn New York, for example, the Commercial Division may hear cases (1) alleging breach of contract, (2) arising under the state's business corporation law, (3) arising under the state's partnership law, (4) relating to commercial loans, negotiable instruments, letters of credit, and bank transactions, or (5) involving business torts. The Commercial Division may not, by comparison, hear cases involving (1) landlord/tenant disputes, (2) commercial foreclosures, (3) products liability claims, or (4) claims alleging discrimination except when part of or under the terms of a contract.\n\nSome states have established specialized courts that include technology disputes as part of their express jurisdiction. Through legislative effort and court rule, Maryland established a Business and Technology Case Management Program. In May 2003, Delaware expanded the Court of Chancery’s jurisdiction to include technology disputes, and the mediation of other kinds of business disputes (10 Del. C. §§ 346, 347).\n\nCalifornia, Connecticut, Phoenix, Arizona, Oregon, and Minnesota have created specialized courts or tracks for complex litigation that would include some business disputes within a broader jurisdiction of complex matters. Other states are in various stages of moving toward or away from business or complex courts, with Colorado having conducted extensive studies over a decade ago into the merits and potential parameters of creating a business court on a broad basis, which was not pursued; and New Jersey considering state wide business court legislation over a period of years.\n\n\n"}

Cir. 1972) was a landmark federal case decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that significantly reshaped malpractice law in the United States. It established the idea of \"informed consent\" to medical procedures.\n\nUntil the 1960s, it was conventional medical doctrine to withhold significant information from patients, particularly potentially upsetting information. It was common practice not to tell a patient they were dying, and even to deny it. When health care providers began to move away from that practice, many still did not fully inform patients who were about to make decisions about future health care and particularly surgery. Instead, many practitioners revealed only information that another physician might provide, following a rule known as \"the professional standard\". Risks, in particular, were often glossed over or omitted entirely. Although the right to consent in medical situations had been recognized for decades, the notion of \"informed\" consent was new.\n\nJerry Watson Canterbury (1939-2017) was an F.B.I. clerk who suffered a ruptured disk in 1958. He was operated on by Dr. William T. Spence, a well-known Washington neurosurgeon, and as a result of the surgery, and a subsequent fall from his bed while hospitalized, he ended up paralyzed below the waist and incontinent. Canterbury sued for malpractice on the grounds of negligence. \nHe was discharged from the hospital three and a half months later, his legs partly paralyzed. During the 1968 trial, the defense argued that since Canterbury lacked expert testimony, the case could not proceed. This lack of testimony was likely the result of a \"conspiracy of silence\" that, at the time, prevented doctors from testifying against one another. Judge Spottswood W. Robinson III of the DC Circuit Court allowed the case to go to a jury, deciding both that an expert was not necessary in such cases and that the standard for informed consent was what a reasonable patient would want to know in rendering a decision. At the second trial, Dr. Spence acknowledged that he had told Canterbury and his mother only that the surgery might result in “weakness\" without mentioning paralysis, and that he avoided a more specific warning so as not to deter the patient from pursuing the operation. Nevertheless, the jury ruled against Canterbury.\n\nAccording to Dr. Jacob M. Appel, \"[t]he major legal implication of the decision...was that it largely shifted our culture from a ‘professional practice standard’ to a ‘reasonable person standard’ in malpractice cases, undermined the tradition and practice of physicians not testifying against each other, and largely opened the floodgates to the far more litigious medicolegal culture we have today.\"\n"}
{"id": "39193418", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39193418", "title": "Carnism", "text": "Carnism\n\nCarnism is a concept used in discussions of humanity's relation to other animals, defined as a prevailing ideology in which people support the use and consumption of animal products, especially meat. Carnism is presented as a dominant belief system supported by a variety of defense mechanisms and mostly unchallenged assumptions. The term \"carnism\" was coined by social psychologist and author Melanie Joy in 2001 and popularized by her book \"Why We Love Dogs, Eat Pigs, and Wear Cows\" (2009).\n\nCentral to the ideology, according to the theory, is the acceptance of meat-eating as \"natural\", \"normal\", \"necessary\", and (sometimes) \"nice\". An important feature of carnism is the classification of only particular species of animal as food, and the acceptance of practices toward those animals that would be rejected as unacceptable cruelty if applied to other species. This classification is culturally relative, so that, for example, dogs are eaten by some people in Korea but may be pets in the West, while cows are eaten in the West but protected in much of India.\n\nAnalyzing the history of vegetarianism and opposition to it from ancient Greece to the present day, literary scholar Renan Larue found certain commonalities in what he described as carnist arguments. According to him, carnists typically held that vegetarianism is a ludicrous idea unworthy of attention, that mankind is invested with dominion over animals by divine authority, and that abstaining from violence against animals would pose a threat to humans. He found that the views that farmed animals do not suffer, and that slaughter is preferable to death by disease or predation, gained currency in the nineteenth century, but that the former had precedent in the writings of Porphyry, a vegetarian who advocated the humane production of animal products which do not require animals to be slaughtered, such as wool.\n\nIn the 1970s traditional views on the moral standing of animals were challenged by animal rights advocates, including psychologist Richard Ryder, who in 1971 introduced the notion of speciesism. This is defined as the assignment of value and rights to individuals solely on the basis of their species membership. In 2001 psychologist and animal rights advocate Melanie Joy coined the term \"carnism\" for a form of speciesism that she argues underpins using animals for food, and particularly killing them for meat. Joy compares carnism to patriarchy, arguing that both are dominant normative ideologies that go unrecognized because of their ubiquity:\n\nSandra Mahlke argues that carnism is the \"central crux of speciesism\" because the eating of meat motivates ideological justification for other forms of animal exploitation.\n\nA central aspect of carnism is that animals are categorized as edible, inedible, pets, vermin, predators, or entertainment animals, according to people's schemata – mental classifications that determine, and are determined by, our beliefs and desires. There is cultural variability regarding which animals count as food. Dogs are eaten in China, and South Korea, but elsewhere are not viewed as food, either because they are loved or, as in the Middle East and parts of India, regarded as unclean. Cows are eaten in the West, but revered in much of India. Pigs are rejected by Muslims and Jews but widely regarded by other groups as edible. Joy and other psychologists argue that these taxonomies determine how the animals within them are treated, influence subjective perceptions of their sentience and intelligence, and reduce or increase empathy and moral concern for them.\n\nJeff Mannes writes that carnism is rooted in a paradox between most people's values and actions: they oppose harming animals, and yet eat them. He argues that this conflict leads to cognitive dissonance, which people attempt to attenuate through psychic numbing. The apparent conflict between caring about animals and embracing diets which require them to be harmed has been termed the \"meat paradox\".\n\nThere is experimental evidence supporting the idea that the meat paradox induces cognitive dissonance in Westerners. Westerners are more willing to eat animals which they regard as having lesser mental capacities and moral standing, and conversely, to attribute lesser mental faculties and moral standing to animals which are eaten. Furthermore, the relationship is causative: the categorization of animals as food or not affects people's perception of their mental characteristics, and the act of eating meat itself causes people to attribute diminished mental capacity to animals. For example, in one study people rated an unfamiliar exotic animal as less intelligent if they were told native people hunted it, and in another they regarded cows as less intelligent after eating beef jerky.\n\nAvoiding consideration of the provenance of animal products is another strategy. Joy argues that this is why meat is rarely served with the animal's head or other intact body parts.\n\nJoy introduced the idea of the \"Three Ns of Justification\", writing that meat-eaters regard meat consumption as \"normal, natural, and necessary\". She argues that the \"Three Ns\" have been invoked to justify other ideologies, including slavery and denying women the right to vote, and are widely recognized as problematic only after the ideology they support has been dismantled.\n\nThe argument holds that people are conditioned to believe that humans evolved to eat meat, that it is expected of them, and that they need it to survive or be strong. These beliefs are said to be reinforced by various institutions, including religion, family and the media. Although scientists have shown that humans get more than enough protein in their diets without eating meat, the belief that meat is required persists.\n\nBuilding on Joy's work, psychologists conducted a series of studies in the United States and Australia, published in 2015, that found the great majority of meat-eaters' stated justifications for consuming meat were based on the \"Four Ns\" – \"natural, normal, necessary, and nice\". The arguments were that humans are omnivores (\"natural\"), that most people eat meat (\"normal\"), that vegetarian diets are lacking in nutrients (\"necessary\"), and that meat tastes good (\"nice\").\n\nMeat-eaters who endorsed these arguments more strongly reported less guilt about their dietary habits. They tended to objectify animals, have less moral concern for them and attribute less consciousness to them. They were also more supportive of social inequality and hierarchical ideologies, and less proud of their consumer choices.\n\nAn illustration of dissonance reduction is the prominence given to \"saved from slaughter\" stories, in which the media focus on one animal that evaded slaughter, while ignoring the millions that did not. Joy wrote that this dichotomy is characteristic of carnism.\n\nAnimals at the center of these narratives include Wilbur in \"Charlotte's Web\" (1952); the eponymous and fictional star of \"Babe\" (1995); Christopher Hogwood in Sy Montgomery's \"The Good, Good Pig\" (2006); the Tamworth Two; and Cincinnati Freedom. The American National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation is cited as another example. A 2012 study found that most media reporting on it celebrated the poultry industry while marginalizing the link between living animals and meat.\n\nOpinion pieces in \"The Huffington Post\", \"The Statesman\", and \"The Drum\" praised the idea, saying the term made it easier to discuss, and challenge, the practices of animal exploitation.\nAn article in the beef industry publication Drovers Cattle Network criticized the use of the term, saying it implied that eating animal foods was a \"psychological sickness\".\n\n\n"}

Graham, Jr., among others.\n\nBorn in Philadelphia in 1927, Wright earned his undergraduate degree from Wesleyan University in 1947 and law degree from Yale in 1949. Wright taught at the University of Minnesota Law School from 1950 to 1955 and at the University of Texas School of Law from 1955 until his death in 2000.\n\nProfessor Wright was a popular, if somewhat eccentric, educator, conducting class without lecture notes or even a copy of the casebook. He had a photographic memory of the materials and would often answer student questions with a correct citation, by specific page, of a case different from the one the class was studying. He always refused to call on women students, unless they volunteered, considering the traditional Socratic approach ungentlemanly to women. In response to accusations of sexism, he simply stopped requiring any student to recite unless he or she volunteered. Professor Wright's icy reserve with students disappeared completely after they graduated and joined the Bar. Many of them were pleasantly surprised to experience his warmth, kindness, gentle humor and interest in their families.\n\nHe was elected a member of the American Law Institute at the age of 30, and served as its president for the last seven years of his life, from 1993 to 2000.\n\nProfessor Wright organized an effective boycott of the Faculty Club at the University of Texas at Austin when operators failed to live up to their promise that the club would not be racially segregated.\n\nWright was a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy and an Honorary Fellow of Wolfson College, University of Cambridge.\n\nWright represented President Richard Nixon on constitutional issues growing out of the Watergate investigations by Congress and the special prosecutor. For a time he clearly appeared to be the President's lead lawyer, but then there was a shuffling of responsibilities, and he did not argue the case in the Supreme Court.\n\nWright was an active litigator before the U.S. Supreme Court. Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg once described Wright as \"a Colossus standing at the summit of our profession.\" A former student teasingly suggested the diminutive Ginsburg was actually referring to Wright's 6-3 height. The politically liberal Ginsburg also referred to Wright, a Republican, as \"the quintessential friend.\" By the end of his life, Wright was on a first-name basis with all nine justices.\n\nWright was also involved in both intramural and intercollegiate athletics. Wright served on the NCAA Committee on Infractions from 1973 until 1983, including five years as chair. At the University of Texas, Wright's achievements extended beyond the classroom and courtroom: Wright led the Legal Eagles – a stunningly successful intramural football team – to 330 wins during his 45-year involvement as coach and athletic director. He was also a member of the committee that was formed to hire a new head football coach of the University of Texas in 1997, eventually hiring Mack Brown.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "410450", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=410450", "title": "Civil Constitution of the Clergy", "text": "Civil Constitution of the Clergy\n\nThe Civil Constitution of the Clergy () was a law passed on 12 July 1790 during the French Revolution, that caused the immediate subordination of the Catholic Church in France to the French government.\n\nEarlier legislation had already arranged the confiscation of the Catholic Church's French land holdings and banned monastic vows. This new law completed the destruction of the monastic orders, outlawing \"all regular and secular chapters for either sex, abbacies and priorships, both regular and \"in commendam\", for either sex\", etc. It also sought to settle the chaos caused by the earlier confiscation of Church lands and the abolition of the tithe. Additionally, the Civil Constitution of the Clergy regulated the current dioceses so that they could become more uniform and aligned with the administrative districts that had recently been created. It emphasised that officials of the church could not provide commitment to anything outside France, specifically the Pope (due to his power and the influence he had) which was outside France. Lastly, the Civil Constitution of the Clergy made Bishops and Priests elected. By having members of the Clergy elected the church lost much of the authority it had to govern itself and was now subject to the people, since they would vote on the Priest and Bishops as opposed to these individuals being appointed by the church and the hierarchy within.\n\nThe Civil Constitution of the Clergy was passed and some of the support for this came from figures that were within the Church, such as the priest and parliamentarian Pierre Claude François Daunou, and, above all, the revolutionary priest Henri Grégoire, who was the first French Catholic priest to take the Obligatory Oath. The measure was opposed, but ultimately acquiesced to, by King Louis XVI.\n\nThe Civil Constitution of the Clergy has four titles with different articles.\n\nEven before the Revolution and the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, the Catholic Church in France (the Gallican Church) had a status that tended to subordinate the Church to the State. Under the Declaration of the Clergy of France (1682) privileges of the French monarch included the right to assemble church councils in their dominions and to make laws and regulations touching ecclesiastical matters of the Gallican Church or to have recourse to the \"appeal as from an abuse\" (\"appel comme d'abus\") against acts of the ecclesiastical power.\nEven prior to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy:\n\nThe following interlinked factors appear to have been the causes of agitation for the confiscation of church lands and for the adoption of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy:\n\nOn 6 February 1790, one week before banning monastic vows, the National Constituent Assembly asked its ecclesiastical committee to prepare the reorganization of the clergy. No doubt, those who hoped to reach a solution amenable to the papacy were discouraged by the consistorial address of March 22 in which Pius VI spoke out against measures already passed by the Assembly; also, the election of the Protestant Jean-Paul Rabaut Saint-Étienne to the presidency of the Assembly brought about \"commotions\" at Toulouse and Nîmes, suggesting that at least some Catholics would accept nothing less than a return to the \"ancien régime\" practice under which only Catholics could hold office.\n\nThe Civil Constitution of the Clergy came before the Assembly on 29 May 1790. François de Bonal, Bishop of Clermont, and some members of the Right requested that the project should be submitted to a national council or to the Pope, but did not carry the day. Joining them in their opposition to the legislation was Abbé Sieyès, one of the chief political theorists of the French Revolution and author of the 1789 pamphlet \"What is the Third Estate?\"\n\nConversely, the Jansenist theologian Armand-Gaston Camus argued that the plan was in perfect harmony with the New Testament and the councils of the fourth century.\n\nThe Assembly passed the Civil Constitution on 12 July 1790, two days before the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille. On that anniversary, the Fête de la Fédération, Talleyrand and three hundred priests officiated at the \"altar of the nation\" erected on the Champ de Mars, wearing tricolor waistbands over their priestly vestments and calling down God's blessing upon the Revolution.\n\nIn 1793, the War in the Vendee was influenced by the Constitution passing due to the devout population toward the Church among other social factors.\n\nAs noted above, even prior to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, church property was nationalized and monastic vows were forbidden. Under the Civil Constitution of the Clergy:\n\nThe tone of the Civil Constitution can be gleaned from Title II, Article XXI:\n\nIn short, new bishops were required to swear loyalty to the State in far stronger terms than to any religious doctrine. Note also that, even in this revolutionary legislation, there are strong remnants of Gallican royalism.\n\nThe law also included some reforms supported even by many within the Church. For example, Title IV, Article I states, \"The law requiring the residence of ecclesiastics in the districts under their charge shall be strictly observed. All vested with an ecclesiastical office or function shall be subject to this, without distinction or exception.\" In effect, this banned the practice by which younger sons of noble families would be appointed to a bishopric or other high church position and live off its revenues without ever moving to the region in question and taking up the duties of the office. The abuse of bishoprics by the nobility was further reduced in Title II, Article XI: \"Bishoprics and cures shall be looked upon as vacant until those elected to fill them shall have taken\nthe oath above mentioned.\" This unified state control over both the nobility and the Church through the use of elected bishops and the oath of loyalty.\n\nFor some time, Louis XVI delayed signing the Civil Constitution, saying that he needed \"official word from Rome\" before doing so. Pope Pius VI broke the logjam on 9 July 1790, writing a letter to Louis rejecting the arrangement. On 28 July, 6 September, and 16 December 1790, Louis XVI wrote letters to Pius VI, complaining that the National Assembly was forcing him to publicly accept the Civil Constitution, and suggesting that Pius VI appease them by accepting a few selected articles too. On 10 July, Pius VI wrote to Louis XVI, indicating to the king that the Church could not accept any of the provisions of the Constitution. The Constitution attempted to change the internal government of the Church, and no political regime had the right to unilaterally change the internal structure of the Church. On 17 August, Pius VI wrote to Louis XVI of his intent to consult with the cardinals about this, but on 10 October Cardinal Rochefoucauld, the Archbishop of Aix, and 30 of France's 131 bishops sent their negative evaluation of the main points of the Civil Constitution to the Pope. Only four bishops actively dissented. On 30 October, the same 30 bishops restated their view to the public, signing a document known as the Exposition of Principles (\"Exposition des principes sur la constitution civile du clergé\"), written by Jean de Dieu-Raymond de Cucé de Boisgelin\n\nOn 27 November 1790, still lacking the king's signature on the law of the Civil Constitution, the National Assembly voted to require the clergy to sign an oath of loyalty to the Constitution. During the debate on that matter, on 25 November, Cardinal de Lomenie wrote a letter claiming that the clergy could be excused from taking the Oath if they lacked mental assent; that stance was to be rejected by the Pope on 23 February 1791. On 26 December 1790, Louis XVI finally granted his public assent to the Civil Constitution, allowing the process of administering the oaths to proceed in January and February 1791.\n\nPope Pius VI's 23 February rejection of Cardinal de Lomenie's position of withholding \"mental assent\" guaranteed that this would become a schism. The Pope's subsequent condemnation of the revolutionary regime and repudiation of all clergy who had complied with the oath completed the schism.\n\nWithin the Civil Constitution of the Clergy there was a clause that required the Clergy to take an oath stating the individual's allegiance to France. The oath was basically an oath of fidelity and it required every single priest in France to make a public choice on whether or not they believed the nation of France had authority over all religious matters. This oath was very controversial because many Clergy believed that they could not put their loyalty towards France before their loyalty towards God. If a clergyman were to refuse to take this oath of allegiance then they were challenging the Civil Constitution of the Clergy and challenging the validity of the assembly which had established the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. On 16 January 1791 approximately 50% of the individuals required to take the oath went ahead and took it and the other half decided to wait for Pope Pius VI to provide instruction, since he was indecisive on what the Oath signified and how the Clergy should respond to it. It is important to note that all but seven of the bishops in France decided to not take the oath and as a reprimand those governing France began to replace the individuals with those who had taken the oath. In March 1791 Pope Pius VI finally decided that the oath was against the beliefs of the Church. By deciding that it was against the beliefs two groups were formed \"jurors\" (\"refractory priests\") and \"non-jurors\" and that was based on whether or not they had decided to take the oath. The Pope condemned those who took the oath and went as far as saying that they were absolutely separated from the church. Additionally, the Pope expressed disapproval and chastised King Louis XVI for signing the document that required the oath to be taken. Since the Pope expressed disapproval those who did not take it stayed unwilling to take it and as a result were replaced by those who had taken it. In addition to not receiving support from approximately 50% of the Clergy the oath was also disliked by a part of France's population. The individuals in France who were opposed to it claimed that the Revolution was destroying their \"true\" faith and this was also seen in the two groups of individuals that were formed because of the oath. Those who believed that the Revolution was causing their \"true\" faith to be destroyed sided with the \"non-jurors\" and those who believed that the French government should have a say in religion sided with the \"jurors.\"\n\nAmerican Scholar Timothy Tackett believes that the oath that was required determined which individuals would let the revolution cause change and allow revolutionary reform and those who did not would remain true to their beliefs for many years to come. Apart from Tackett's beliefs, it can be said that the obligatory oath marked a key historical point in the French Revolution since it was the first piece of legislation in the revolution that received massive drawback and resistance.\n\nAs noted above, the government required all clergy to swear an oath of loyalty to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. Only seven bishops and about half of the clergy agreed while the rest refused; the latter became known as \"non-jurors\" or \"refractory priests.\" In areas where a majority had taken the oath, such as Paris, the refractory minority could be victimized by society at large: nuns from the Hôtel-Dieu de Paris, for example, were subjected to humiliating public spankings.\n\nWhile there was a higher rate of rejection in urban areas, most of these refractory priests (like most of the population) lived in the countryside, and the Civil Constitution generated considerable resentment among religious peasants. Meanwhile, the Pope repudiated the \"jurors\" who had signed the oath, especially bishops who had ordained new, elected clergy, and above all Bishop Louis-Alexandre Expilly de la Poipe. In May 1791, France recalled its ambassador to the Vatican and the Papal Nuncio was recalled from Paris. On June 9, the Assembly forbade the publication of Papal Bulls or Decrees, unless they had been approved by the Assembly as well.\n\nThe Constituent Assembly went back and forth on the exact status of non-juring priests. On 5 February 1791, non-juring priests were banned from preaching in public. By not allowing the clergy to preach the National Assembly was trying to silence the Clergy. This punishment that was imposed by the assembly signified that all refractory priest could no longer practice marriages and baptisms which were public ceremonies. By not allowing refractory clergy to practice these large public ceremonies they were silenced. However, non-juring clergy continued to celebrate the Mass and attract crowds because the Assembly feared that stripping them of all of their powers would create chaos and that would be ineffective towards silencing them. Although the Assembly allowed them to continue working in ceremonies that were not public they stated that they could only do so until they had been replaced by a clergyman who had taken the oath (juring). A large percentage of the refractionary priests were not replaced until 10 August 1792, which was more than a year after the original 50% had taken the oath; by the time they began to be replaced the Assembly had made some changes and it was not as significant that they were practicing Mass.\n\nAt the beginning, when the Assembly was stripping the clergy of their titles they tried to ignore how the extreme anti-clerical elements were responding with violence against those who attended these Masses and against nuns who would not renounce their vocation. Ultimately the Assembly had to recognize the schism that was occurring because it was extremely evident, even while the replacement was occurring juror priests often faced a hostile and violent reception in their old parishes. On 7 May 1791, the Assembly reversed itself, deciding that the non-juring priests, referred to as \"prêtres habitués\" (\"habitual priests\") could say Mass and conduct services in other churches on condition that they would respect the laws and not stir up revolt against the Civil Constitution. The assembly had to allow this change to control the schism and in part because \"Constitutional Clergy\" (those who had taken the oath) were unable to properly conduct their service. The constitutional clergy often required the assistance of the National Guard due to the mayhem that would occur.\n\nThe division in France was at an all-time high when even families had different views on juring and non-juring priest. The difference in families was primarily seen when the women would attend masses that where held by those who had defied the oath and men attended mass that was provided by clergymembers who had taken the oath. It is important to note that even though priests who had not taken the Oath had the right to use the churches many were not allowed to use the buildings (this was done by priest who had sworn their allegiance) this furthermore demonstrated the division in the state. On 29 November 1791, the Legislative Assembly, which had replaced the National Constituent Assembly, decreed that refractory priests could only exacerbate factionalism and aggravate extremists in the constituent assembly. The November 29th decree declared that no refractory priest could invoke the rights in the Constitution of the Clergy and that all such priests were suspect and so to be arrested. Louis XVI vetoed this decree (as he also did with another text concerning the creation of an army of 20,000 men on the orders of the Assembly, precipitating the monarchy's fall), which was toughened and re-issued a year later. Anti-Catholic persecution by the State would intensify into de-Christianization and propagation of the Cult of Reason and the Cult of the Supreme Being in 1793–1794. During this time countless non-juring priests were interned in chains on prison ships in French harbors where most died within a few months from the appalling conditions.\n\nAfter the Thermidorian Reaction, the Convention repealed the Civil Constitution of the Clergy; however, the schism between the civilly constituted French Church and the Papacy was only resolved when the Concordat of 1801 was agreed on. The Concordat was reached on July 15, 1801 and it was made widely known the following year, on Easter. It was an agreement executed by Napoleon Bonaparte and clerical and papal representatives from Rome and Paris, and determined the role and status of the Roman Catholic Church in France; moreover, it concluded the confiscations and church reforms that had been implemented over the course of the revolution. The agreement also gave the first consul (Napoleon) the authority and right to nominate bishops, redistribute the current parishes and bishoprics, and allowed for seminaries to be established. In an effort to please Pius VII it was agreed upon that suitable salaries would be provided for bishops and curés and he would condone the acquisition of church lands.\n\n"}

The Act established universal suffrage for federal elections for those who are British subjects over 21 years of age who have lived in Australia for six months, with some qualifications. It granted Australian women the right to vote at a national level, and to stand for election to the Parliament.\n\nThe Act meant that, though the Colony of New Zealand had granted women universal suffrage in 1893 and this carried forward to New Zealand subsequently becoming an independent nation in 1907, Australia was the first independent country to grant women's suffrage at a national level, and the first country to allow women to stand for Parliament. However, the Act also disqualified some Indigenous Australians, Asian people, African people and Pacific Islanders (except New Zealand Maori) from voting, even if they would otherwise be qualified as British subjects.\n\nThe act was replaced by the \"Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918\".\n\nThe Act was originally very short, having only five sections. The main provision was section three, which provided that electors in a federal election are naturally born British subjects over twenty-one years of age, male or female, married or single, who have lived in Australia for at least six months, and are on the electoral roll in any federal electoral division.\n\nAt the time whoever was considered a British subject was determined by rules of English commonwealth law, as an independent Australian citizenship was not introduced until 26 January 1949, with the coming into effect of the Australian nationality law, \"Australian Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948\".\n\nSection 4 of the Act made a range of disqualifications from the general definition in section 3. People who had at any time been convicted of treason could not vote. A person who was under sentence or awaiting sentence for any offence which could be punished by imprisonment for one year or longer (under the law of Australia, or of the United Kingdom, or of any other Dominion of the Empire) was also not allowed to vote. People of \"unsound mind\" were also disqualified. Indigenous people from Australia, Asia, Africa and the Pacific Islands, [excluding New Zealand and 'aboriginal native of Australia' entitled by Section 41 of the Constitution to vote in State Government elections], were not entitled to enroll to vote in an election of the Parliament of the Commonwealth. \n\nSection 41 of the Constitution provided in short that 'No adult person with a right to vote at an elections for a State Parliament can be prevented by any law of the Commonwealth from voting at elections for the Parliament of the Commonwealth'.\n\nFor Example:Indian people were therefore not allowed to vote, even though they were citizens of the British Empire, unless they had voting right in the State in which they were resident.\n\nSection 44 of the Constitution disqualified a range of people from being elected to the House of Representatives or the Senate, such as any person with an allegiance to a foreign power (such as a citizen of another country), or anyone who was bankrupt or insolvent. However, these people were not prevented from voting by the Act.\n\nSection 5 provided that no person could vote more than once at an election.\n\nIn 1906 the 1902 Act was amended to allow postal voting. In 1908, a permanent electoral roll was established and in 1911, it became compulsory for all eligible voters to enroll on the electoral roll. Compulsory enrolment led to a large increase in voter turnout, even though voting was still voluntary. From 1912, elections have been held on Saturdays.\n\nBefore Federation of Australia in 1901, Australia consisted of six colonies, each with their own voting systems and franchise. Section 41 of the Constitution of Australia governed how the first federal election in 1901 was to be conducted. It provided that any person who was enrolled and eligible to vote in a State election could also vote in a federal election. Each state had a different system, with different criteria to determine who could vote. In South Australia and Western Australia, women could vote, and in Western Australia and Queensland, Indigenous people were specifically barred from voting.\n\nThe 1902 Commonwealth Act created a uniform voting system for federal elections across the country. The original bill was introduced into the Senate by Richard O'Connor, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, and later in the House of Representatives by the Minister for Home Affairs, William Lyne. It is unusual for being one of the few major pieces of legislation to be introduced in the Senate before the House.\n\nIn 1918, the 1902 Act was repealed and replaced by the \"Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918\". Many of the present features of the Australian electoral system were introduced after the 1918 Act came in force. Instant-runoff voting was introduced for the House of Representatives in 1918, compulsory voting was introduced in 1924, and the single transferable vote was introduced for the Senate in 1949. Indigenous Australians were granted the right to vote at federal elections in 1962. The qualifying voting age was lowered to 18 in 1973.\n\nBecause of Section 41 of the Constitution, women in South Australia and Western Australia were able to vote at federal elections. Although the original distribution between the states of seats in the House of Representatives was based on the number of male voters in each state, it was possible that later distributions could proportionally increase the number of seats given to South Australia and Western Australia, since they had proportionally more enrolled voters than their percentage of the population.\n\nMany politicians were concerned that allowing women to vote would discriminate in favour of married men, since, in the words of Sir Edward Braddon, \"the married man, happy in his family, whose wife's vote is one which he can command… will have two votes.\" Others, such as William Sawers, argued that because there were more women living in the cities, rural areas would become under-represented. Much of the opposition to the granting of women's suffrage in the Act was grounded in the belief that, in the words of William Knox, \"the main ambition of a woman's life should be to become the wife of an honorable and honest man.\" However, there was much support for granting the vote to women, and the bill was approved by large majorities in both Houses of Parliament.\n\nThe White Australia policy, or at least the ideas behind it, had been very strong since long before Federation. Although the \"Immigration Restriction Act 1901\" was established to prevent non-white people from migrating to Australia, significant numbers of foreign citizens, particularly Chinese people who migrated during the Victorian gold rush, were already living in Australia, and many politicians were keen to prevent them from having any political influence. Politicians also wanted to prevent Indigenous people from voting. Although Indigenous men had the right to vote everywhere except Western Australia and Queensland, and Indigenous women also had the right to vote in South Australia, this was not because it had explicitly been given to them, but because it had not explicitly been denied to them.\n\nPreventing non-white people from voting was an idea grounded in the philosophy of eugenics and scientific racism, which were popular ideas at the time. Whereas most Indigenous peoples were excluded from voting, Māori living in Australia were allowed to vote. During the parliamentary debates over the Act, King O'Malley (a radical and \"colourful\" politician) said that \"An Aboriginal is not as intelligent as a Māori. There is no scientific evidence that he is a human being at all.\"\n\nIn line with the attitudes of the time, the Act disqualified some Indigenous Australians, Asian people, African people and Pacific Islanders (except New Zealand Maori) from voting, even if they would otherwise be qualified as British subjects. In relation to Indigenous Australians, the Act providing that \"No aboriginal native of Australia ... shall be entitled to have his name placed on an Electoral Roll unless so entitled under section forty-one of the Constitution\". Section forty-one of the Constitution provided that all those entitled to vote in state elections under the state franchise could vote in Commonwealth elections. It was not clear whether that section was intended to be an ongoing provision, or only an interim measure for State electors enrolled at the time of Federation. The first Permanent Head of the Attorney-General's Department, Robert Garran, gave it the second, narrower, interpretation.\n\n\n\n"}

The term derives from an obsolete usage. Various concoctions were formerly created that were believed to be beneficial to one's health, especially for the heart (\"cor\" in Latin).\n\nSome cordials, with their flecks of gold leaf and bright yellow hue, took their name from the \"cordial vertues\" of the rays of the sun, which some alchemists thought they contained.\n\nMost cordials were of European origin, first produced in Italian apothecaries during the Renaissance where the art of distilling was refined during the 15th and 16th centuries. It is from this origin that cordials are frequently referred to in French as \"Liqueurs d'ltalie\", it is also from this that we have liqueurs. From the Renaissance onwards, cordials were usually based on alcohol in which certain herbs, spices or other ingredients were allowed to steep. The first cordials arrived in England in the late 15th century and were called distilled cordial waters. These were strictly used as alcoholic medicines, prescribed in small doses to invigorate and revitalise the heart, body and spirit as well as cure diseases. By the 18th century cordials were being imbibed for their intoxicating effects and medicinal virtues, and were fast becoming recreational drinks, eventually evolving into liqueurs.\n\nThough cordials originated on the continent, a number of British \"sweet drams\" achieved popularity in Europe.\n\nCordials were used to renew the natural heat, recreate and revive the spirits, and free the whole body from the malignity of diseases. Many cordials were also considered aphrodisiacs, a view which encouraged their consumption in a social as opposed to a medical context. Other early varieties of alcoholic cordials were flavoured with spices and herbal ingredients which were thought to settle the stomach after excessive eating. These cordials were called Surfeit Waters, which were specifically created for treating overindulgence.\n\nPrecious ingredients like gold, pearls and coral were sometimes added. These were believed to revive the spirit and to preclude disease.\n\nLucy Pevensie, a pivotal character in C. S. Lewis's \"Chronicles of Narnia\", was, as Queen Lucy in \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\", gifted a bottle of magical cordial by Father Christmas along with her dagger, prior to the Battle of Berunia. The cordial was said to be made from the juice of Fire-Flowers that grew in the mountains of the sun, with a single drop curing almost any illness or injury, bringing people back from the brink of death in some cases. The use of the word \"cordial\" by the author was archaic even at the time.\n\n\n\n"}

On the basis of public confusion, the counteraction principle (in essence) will not hinder companies using trademarks which are similar to those of famous marks. This is because most famous marks are likely to be easily identifiable, and therefore not likely to lead to confusion from the general public.\n\nIn Ruiz-Picasso and Others v OHIM [2006] ECR I-643, the estate of Pablo Picasso argued that Daimler Chrysler infringed upon the Picasso trademark when it licensed PSA Peugeot Citroën to use the trademark Picaro on one its models. The estate argued that the trademark name Picaro was too similar to Picasso and would cause public confusion. After being defeated in lower European courts, the appeal was dismissed in the European Court of Justice.\n\nIn Les Éditions Albert René Sàrl v Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market, Orange A/S, the applicants claimed that Community Trade Mark protection for Mobilix would risk confusing consumers on the basis that the trademarks were phonetically similar. OHIM accepted the registration of the mark on the basis that everyone knew the fictional character Obelix. The OHIM Board of Appeal allowed for opposition by the Paris-based publisher of the Obelix character for classes 9 and 35 of the Madrid System. However, for all other classes the appeal was dismissed, as the General Court (European Union) concluded that there should be no confusion over such a popular character.\n\n\n"}

He spent much of his childhood in Spring Valley, New York. Burton also lived in Athens, Georgia for a while, where his trip hop work was released under the name \"Pelican City\". He also remixed work by several local artists, including Neutral Milk Hotel and DJ'd for University of Georgia radio station WUOG-FM. From 1998 to 2003, Burton also created a series of remix CDs and records under the stage name Danger Mouse. He performed in a mouse outfit because he was too shy to show his face, and took his name from the British cartoon series \"Danger Mouse\".\n\nWhile in Athens, Burton took second place in a 1998 talent contest and was asked to open for a concert at the University of Georgia featuring OutKast and Goodie Mob. Afterwards, Burton approached CeeLo Green, a member of Goodie Mob, and gave him an instrumental demo tape. It would be several years before the pair made contact again, but the two would eventually collaborate as Gnarls Barkley.\n\nBurton moved to Britain for a couple of years, living in New Cross in London and working at the Rose pub near London Bridge. While there, he sent a demo to Lex Records, which signed him. Burton then relocated to Los Angeles; his first original releases under the name Danger Mouse were his collaborations with rapper Jemini, including the album \"Ghetto Pop Life\", released in 2003 on Lex Records. While the Danger Mouse debut was well received by critics, he did not rise to fame until he created \"The Grey Album\", mixing a cappella versions of Jay-Z's \"The Black Album\" over beats crafted from samples of The Beatles' \"White Album\". The remix album, originally created just for his friends, spread over the Internet and became very popular with both the general audience and critics, with \"Rolling Stone\" calling it the ultimate remix record and \"Entertainment Weekly\" ranking it the best record of that year. He discussed his feelings about any controversy the album may have created in the documentary \"Alternative Freedom\". Danger Mouse was also named among the Men of the Year by \"GQ\" in 2004 and won a 2005 \"Wired\" Rave Award.\n\n\"The Grey Album\" also got the attention of Damon Albarn, who enlisted Danger Mouse to produce the Gorillaz' second studio album, \"Demon Days\". \"Demon Days\" earned Burton a Grammy Award nomination for Producer of the Year.\n\nDanger Mouse's next project was \"The Mouse and the Mask\", a collaboration with MF DOOM (as DANGERDOOM) about and for Cartoon Network's Adult Swim.

Instrumentation was done mainly by musicians who played on the original Ennio Morricone scores. Danger Mouse does not play any instruments on the album. The style of the album reflects much of Danger Mouse's work since 2005, such as segments of Beck's \"Modern Guilt\", aspects of \"Dark Night of the Soul\", and songs like \"Mongrel Heart\" off of the self-titled \"Broken Bells\" album. The album was titled \"Rome\" and was released on May 16, 2011.\n\nOn February 13, 2011, Danger Mouse won a Grammy for Best Producer for his work on the Black Keys' \"Brothers\", Broken Bells' self-titled album, and the Danger Mouse and Sparklehorse album \"Dark Night of the Soul\".\n\nOn November 1, 2011, Los Angeles-based indie band Electric Guest released their first single, \"Troubleman/American Daydream\", produced by Danger Mouse. Danger Mouse produced the band's whole debut album \"Mondo\" which was released on April 24, 2012.\n\nOn May 1, 2012, Norah Jones released her Danger Mouse-produced fifth studio album \"Little Broken Hearts\" (Blue Note/EMI).\n\nDanger Mouse co-wrote the song \"Keep It for Your Own\" by POP ETC.\n\nDanger Mouse produced Portugal.

Production began in February 2015. The production was halted due to an injury the band's bassist Flea suffered during a skiing trip. It resumed in August 2015 and continued into early 2016. \"The Getaway\" was released in June 2016 with Danger Mouse also performing on and having co-writing credits on many of the songs.\n\nHe won a Grammy in 2017 for his work as a producer on the Album of the Year, Adele's \"25\".\n\nIn March 2017, Red Hot Chili Peppers singer Anthony Kiedis indicated that the band would likely want to work again with Danger Mouse on the follow-up to \"The Getaway\". Kiedis stated \"I think it's good to work with the same guy again to um, you know you had your freshman experience. I think we owe it to ourselves to start from the beginning with this guy and see what we can accomplish.\"\n\nIn April 2017, he released \"Resistance Radio: The Man in The High Castle\", a compilation produced alongside 30th Century Records-signee producer Sam Cochen. Connected to Amazon's eponymous TV series, this album contains covers of 1960s classics by contemporary artists like Beck, Norah Jones, Kelis, Andrew VanWyngarden, The Shins, and more.\nIn June 2017, Portugal. The Man released Woodstock, their follow-up to 2013's Evil Friends; both of which featured production from Danger Mouse.\n\nIn June 2017, he collaborated with Run the Jewels and Big Boi to create the song \"Chase Me\" for the 2017 film Baby Driver.\n\nIn an interview for \"The New York Times\" magazine, Danger Mouse was compared to a film auteur, basing his music production philosophy on the cinematic philosophy of directors like Woody Allen. \"Woody Allen was an auteur: he did his thing, and that particular thing was completely his own,\" he said. \"That's what I decided to do with music. I want to create a director's role within music, which is what I tried to do on this album (\"St. Elsewhere\")... I can create different kinds of musical worlds, but the artist needs the desire to go into that world... Musically, there is no one who has the career I want. That's why I have to use film directors as a model.\"\n\n\n"}

They relate to deletion of data, collection of massive amounts of data, and clarification of the new Ombudsperson mechanism. The European Data Protection Supervisor issued an opinion on 30 May 2016 in which he stated that \"the Privacy Shield, as it stands, is not robust enough to withstand future legal scrutiny before the [European] Court\".\n\nOn 8 July 2016 EU Member States representatives (article 31 committee) approved the final version of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, paving the way for the adoption of the decision by the Commission. The European Commission adopted the framework on 12 July 2016 and it went into effect the same day.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order entitled \"Enhancing Public Safety\" which states that U.S. privacy protections will not be extended beyond US citizens or residents:\nThe European Commission has stated that:\n\nThe Commission said it will \"continue to monitor the implementation of both instruments\".\n\nGerman MEP Jan Philipp Albrecht and campaigner Max Schrems criticized the new ruling, with the latter predicting that the Commission might be taking a \"round-trip to Luxembourg\" (where the European Court of Justice is located). Many Europeans demanded a mechanism for individual European citizens to lodge complaints over the use of their data, as well as a transparency scheme to assure that European citizens' data does not fall into the hands of U.S intelligence agencies.\n\nAs of February 2017 the future of the Privacy Shield is contested. One consultant, Matt Allison, predicts that \"The EU's citizen-driven, regulated model will swiftly come into conflict with the market forces of the US and the UK.\" Allison summarizes a new paper in which the European Commission lays out its plans for adequacy decisions and global strategy.\n\nThe Privacy Shield has been challenged legally by privacy groups. , it is not clear whether the cases will be considered admissible.\n\n\n"}

Planned and built from 1952 to 1957, it is notable as the first planned racially integrated development in Philadelphia and among the first in the United States.\n\nThe developer, Morris Milgram, a leader of the open housing movement, required that 55 percent of the homes be sold to whites, and 45 percent to non-whites. The first house sold in 1956 for $20,000. The isolated little neighborhood included its own swimming pool, which was filled in circa 1985, leaving no trace above ground.\n\nEighteen (originally nineteen) one-story single-family homes are arranged in a heavily wooded cul de sac on Longford Street off Holme Avenue, surrounded on three sides by Pennypack Park. The simple wood-frame homes were designed in a Modernist style by the architectural firm of Montgomery & Bishop in consultation with architects Louis Kahn and Harry Duncan and landscape architect Margaret Lancaster Duncan.\n\nGreenbelt Knoll won several awards for design excellence. For example, the American Institute of Architects, \"House and Home\", \"Better Homes and Gardens\", and the National Broadcasting Corporation bestowed its Homes for Better Living award on the development. Also, Philadelphia Mayor Richardson Dilworth, an ardent advocate of exceptional planning and design, conferred a City of Philadelphia Tribute on Montgomery & Bishop; he gave the tribute \"for the design of Greenbelt Knoll Homes, which ... brought new standards of contemporary residential architecture to Philadelphia.\"\n\nThe original residents included Milgram himself; Robert N.C. Nix, Sr., the first African American to represent Pennsylvania in Congress; Pulitzer Prize–winning African-American playwright Charles Fuller, who grew up here; the Rev. Leon Sullivan, the civil rights activist, who developed the Sullivan Principles and hastened the end of apartheid in South Africa; and Fire Captain Roosevelt Barlow, a civil rights activist who was one of a group of African-American firefighters to integrate the Philadelphia Fire Department.\n\nGreenbelt Knoll was listed as a historic district on the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places in 2006 and in the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. The site is marked with a plaque placed by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission.\n\nSeventeen of the existing homes are considered contributing properties; one home was completely rebuilt following a c. 1980 fire and is considered non-contributing. An additional lot (#17) is now open space, as the house was demolished 1997. Including the 5 detached garages, a studio, and the 2-acre community park that was part of the original neighborhood design, there are 26 resources: 22 contributing buildings and 1 contributing site (park), 2 non-contributing buildings and 1 non-contributing site (Lot #17).

It can be contrasted with the law on domicile, traditionally used in common law jurisdictions to do the same thing.\n\nHabitual residence is less demanding than domicile and the focus is more on past experience rather than future intention. There is normally only one habitual residence where the individual usually resides and routinely returns to after visiting other places. It is the geographical place considered \"home\" for a reasonably significant period of time.\n\nThe concept of habitual residence is used in a number of international conventions, beginning with the Hague Convention on Civil Procedure of 14 November 1896 and a number of international conventions dealing with conflict to complement or supplant the traditional connecting factor of domicile, e.g. in the Rome Convention 1980, but it was replaced, with respect to legal entities by the new connecting factor of principal office. It is the basis of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, the Convention on International Child Abduction, etc. \n\nHabitual residence is something less than domicile but more than simple residence. It may also be more discriminating that the test of nationality or \"lex patriae\" in that the connection is to a specific location within a state rather than to the country of nationality which may contain several subnational jurisdictions (such as states or provinces). Hence, where a country contains more than one legal system, the residence must determine which of the several possible laws might apply (e.g. in the United States which of the laws of the U.S. states is to be applied). A supranational example of this selection process is contained in Article 19 of the Rome Convention:\n\nTo establish a domicile of choice, it is necessary to have a clear factual base in one state and that must be accompanied by an \"animus semper manendi\" (). Although it is not so difficult to produce evidence that an individual has established a home in a state, it is very difficult to prove that someone has no intention of ever establishing a home in another state. The test for habitual residence is less demanding. The court focuses on the past experience of the individual and not so much on future intention. \n\nA person can have only one habitual residence. It is the place where the individual ordinarily resides and routinely returns to after visiting other places. It is the place he or she would consider to be \"home\" and it is established as a matter of geography over a reasonably significant period of time.\n\nSince habitual residence is a test of fact, it cannot be a purely legal concept and there are different views about the factual situations which it is supposed to denote. Some authors believe that the sole criterion that the test of habitual residence should be purely objective, seeking evidence of physical presence over a considerable period of time. Others assert that the test should be both objective and subjective elements: the \"factum\" or physical presence in a given place and the \"animus\" to continue to stay there.\n\nThe Hague Conference on Private International Law has deliberately refrained from offering a definition so that the concept may be flexible and adaptable to practical requirements. Thus, habitual residence may be interpreted differently in different Conflict situations. However, the core of the test will tend to be based on evidence of a long-term stay accompanied by other evidence of the individual's personal and professional life to demonstrate the continuity of the connection between that person and the place of residence. To that extent, the intention of the individual may have some weight.\n\nBut it may be difficult to determine where a person has a habitual residence if constantly on the move and has no real or continuing connection with any of the countries through which passed. This could be resolved by reference to the individual's intention, but although the test of intention is well-defined in the case law for the purposes of domicile, there is no consensus of the strength of intention that would have to be shown to establish \"habit\". Similarly, there is no consensus on the length of time a person should have a home for it to become habitual.\n\nIn some countries, the legislature has produced a test. In Canada, Manitoba abolished the common law test of domicile and substituted the following:\n\nAgne Limante (2018) Establishing habitual residence of adults under the Brussels IIa regulation: best practices from national case-law, Journal of Private International Law, 14:1, 160-181, DOI: 10.1080/17441048.2018.1442128\n\n"}

{"id": "880268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=880268", "title": "King–Byng affair", "text": "King–Byng affair\n\nThe King–Byng affair was a Canadian constitutional crisis that occurred in 1926, when the Governor General of Canada, the Lord Byng of Vimy, refused a request by his prime minister, William Lyon Mackenzie King, to dissolve parliament and call a general election.\n\nThe crisis came to redefine the role of governor general, not only in Canada but throughout the Dominions, becoming a major impetus in negotiations at Imperial Conferences held in the late 1920s that led to the adoption of the Statute of Westminster 1931. According to constitutional convention in the British Empire, the governor general once represented both the sovereign in his imperial council and in his Canadian council, but the convention had evolved with Byng's predecessors, the Canadian government, and the Canadian people into a tradition of non-interference in Canadian political affairs on the part of the British government. After 1931, the governor general remained an important figure in Canadian governance as a constitutional watchdog, but the role was shorn of its previous imperial duties.\n\nIn September 1925, William Lyon Mackenzie King, the Prime Minister of Canada, advised the Governor General, the Lord Byng of Vimy, to dissolve parliament and drop the writ for a general election, to which Lord Byng agreed. In the subsequent election, held on 29 October, Arthur Meighen's Conservative Party won 116 seats in the House of Commons to 101 for King's Liberals. Counting on the support of the Progressive Party, with its 28 seats, to overcome the Conservative plurality, King (who had lost his seat in the election, and didn't regain a seat formally until February 1926 thanks to Charles McDonald) did not resign and remained in office as head of a minority government. Strictly speaking, this was not a coalition government, as the Progressives were not given any Cabinet seats and were thus not a part of the government.\n\nOn 30 October, King visited Byng after consulting with the rest of Cabinet and informed the Governor General that his government would continue until parliament decided otherwise. Byng, who had suggested to King that he ought to resign with such a tenuous mandate, later claimed to have told the Prime Minister: \"Well, in any event you must not at any time ask for a dissolution unless Mr Meighen is first given a chance to show whether or not he is able to govern,\" to which King acquiesced.\n\nWhile Meighen and other Conservatives expressed public outrage at what they viewed as a desperate attempt on the part of King to cling to power, some Conservatives were privately relieved by King's decision; they seriously doubted whether the Tories could convince the Progressives to support a Conservative minority government, were confident that King's attempt to remain in power would eventually fail, and thought the expected debacle would be so damaging to the Liberals' reputation that the Conservatives would then be swept into office with a large majority.\n\nA few months later, one of King's appointees in the Department of Customs and Excise was revealed to have taken bribes, after which the Conservatives alleged that the corruption extended to the highest levels of government, including the prime minister. King had already replaced the Minister of Customs and Excise, Jacques Bureau, with Georges Henri Boivin, but recommended that Byng appoint Bureau to the Senate. This further alienated the members of the Progressive Party. The Progressives were already distancing themselves from the government because of its failure to transfer control of Alberta's natural resources from the federal government to the province, but in June had saved the government from defeat in a no-confidence motion on the matter.\nThe Progressive Party's support was temporarily retained by the formation of a special committee to investigate the corruption in the customs department. Its report, which was presented to the House of Commons, acknowledged that there was widespread fraud in the department but did not specifically criticise the government. A Conservative Member of Parliament (MP), H. H. Stevens, proposed an amendment to the report which would effectively censure the government and compel it to resign. However, Labour MP J. S. Woodsworth proposed amending Stevens' amendment to remove the censure of the government and set up a Royal Commission to investigate the customs department further. The motion was defeated, despite the full support of the government. A Progressive MP, W. R. Fansher, then proposed that a Royal Commission be combined with the original motion of censure. The Speaker of the House ruled the motion out of order, but, on division, the members over-ruled the speaker and the Cabinet was defeated again. After a motion that the House adjourn, put forward by a Progressive member at King's behest, was subsequently also voted down, King announced that he would accept Fansher's amendment and secured an adjournment.\n\nTo avoid the inevitable vote on the Fansher amendment, which would either force his government's resignation or bring his administration into disrepute, King went to Byng on 26 June 1926 seeking a dissolution of parliament. Byng, though, using his reserve powers, refused the request, reminding King of their agreement made the previous October and arguing that the Conservatives, as the biggest single party in parliament, should have a chance to form a government before an election was called. For the next two days, the Prime Minister and the Governor General discussed the matter, with Byng asking King not to request a dissolution which he could not give and King twice requesting that Byng consult the British government prior to making any decision. Byng again refused, saying the matter should be settled in Canada, without resort to London. With Byng remaining steadfast, King then, on 28 June, formally presented the Governor General with an Order in Council for the dissolution of parliament, which Byng declined to sign, on the grounds that the House of Commons should first be given the opportunity to decide if it could support an alternate government. Thus, believing that he no longer had enough support to stay in office, King resigned, as per convention that requires a prime minister who has lost the support of the House of Commons to either step down or advise the governor general to drop the writs for an election.\n\nByng then invited Conservative leader Arthur Meighen to form a government. Although many Conservatives privately preferred an election, Meighen believed he was bound by honour and convention to accept Byng's invitation. Meighen thus formed a new Cabinet. At that time, convention dictated that the ministers of the Crown drawn from the House of Commons were obliged upon appointment to resign their seats in parliament and run for re-election. This posed a problem for Meighen: his and the other ministers' temporary absence would make the government extremely vulnerable in the event of a vote of non-confidence. Meighen circumvented this by advising the appointment to Cabinet of ministers without portfolio, who were not required to run for re-election. The Liberals were infuriated over this usage of \"acting ministers\" and were able to get the Progressives to join them in a successful drive to bring down the Conservative minority government, the government losing confidence by only one vote.\n\nMeighen subsequently requested a dissolution of parliament, which was granted by Byng, and an election was called. King's Liberals won a plurality of seats in the House of Commons, while Meighen lost his seat.\n\nUpon returning to power, King's government sought at an imperial conference to redefine the role of the governor general as a personal representative of the sovereign in his Canadian council and not of the British government (the king in his British council). The change was agreed to at the Imperial Conference of 1926 and came to be official as a result of the Balfour Declaration of 1926 and Statute of Westminster 1931.\n\nIn a letter to the Dominion's monarch, King George V, whom he represented in Canada as governor general, Byng expressed surprise that the Liberal leader, a staunch nationalist, had requested that Byng consult the Colonial Office in London over the matter. Byng said: \"I have to await the verdict of history to prove my having adopted a wrong course, and this I do with an easy conscience that, right or wrong, I have acted in the interests of Canada and implicated no one else in my decision.\" The Colonial Secretary, Leo Amery, privately informed Byng that had he appealed to the British government for an answer, \"I could only have replied... that in my view it would not be proper for the Secretary of State to issue instructions to the Governor with regard to the exercise of his constitutional duties.\"\n\nByng returned to the United Kingdom, leaving Canada on 30 September 1926 a much respected man, despite the political crisis. Some authorities have held that Byng was constitutionally obligated to refuse King's request; for example, Eugene Forsey argued that King's advice to Byng was \"utterly unprecedented\" and said further: \"It was tantamount to allowing a prisoner to discharge the jury by which he was being tried... If the Governor-General had granted the request, he would have become an accomplice in a flagrant act of contempt for Parliament.\" The relatively brief time that King had served in office prior to seeking a dissolution has also been cited as a reason for denying his request. In the United Kingdom in 1950, the Lascelles Principles expressed the relevant constitutional conventions in the matter, in which the King-Byng controversy served as one of the underlying precedents.\n\nOther authorities agreed with King, since, by custom, the Lord Byng of Vimy was obligated to heed the Prime Minister's request to call the election. In 1997, then Governor-General of New Zealand Sir Michael Hardie Boys expressed the opinion that Byng had been in error in not re-appointing King as prime minister and then granting the dissolution of parliament to King instead of Meighen.\n\nThe King–Byng Affair was the most controversial use of a governor general's reserve powers until the Australian constitutional crisis of 1975, in which the Governor-General of Australia, Sir John Kerr, dismissed Prime Minister Gough Whitlam.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18935627", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18935627", "title": "Limitations and exceptions to copyright", "text": "Limitations and exceptions to copyright\n\nLimitations and exceptions to copyright are provisions, in local copyright law or Berne Convention, which allow for copyrighted works to be used without a license from the copyright owner.\n\nLimitations and exceptions to copyright relate to a number of important considerations such as market failure, freedom of speech, education and equality of access (such as by the visually impaired). Some view limitations and exceptions as \"user rights\"—seeing user rights as providing an essential balance to the rights of the copyright owners. There is no consensus among copyright experts as to whether user rights are rights or simply limitations on copyright. See for example the National Research Council's Digital Agenda Report, note 1. The concept of user rights has also been recognised by courts, including the Canadian Supreme Court in CCH Canadian Ltd v. Law Society of Upper Canada (2004 SCC 13), which classed \"fair dealing\" as such a user right. These kinds of disagreements in philosophy are quite common in the philosophy of copyright, where debates about jurisprudential reasoning tend to act as proxies for more substantial disagreements about good policy.\n\nThe scope of copyright limitations and exceptions became a subject of societal and political debate within various nations in the late 1990s and early 2000s, largely due to the impact of digital technology, the changes in national copyright legislations for compliance with TRIPS, and the enactment of anti-circumvention rules in response to the WIPO Copyright Treaty. The European People's Party concluded that international instruments for the protection of copyright no longer seem capable of guaranteeing creators and investors a fair return on their activities while ensuring the public’s access to information and respect for privacy.\n\nDefenders of copyright exceptions fear that technology, contract law undermining copyright law and copyright law not being amended, is reducing the scope of important exceptions and therefore harming creativity.\n\nIn May 2010 a declaration entitled Copyright for Creativity was launched, stating: \"While exclusive rights have been adapted and harmonised to meet the challenges of the knowledge economy, copyright’s exceptions are radically out of line with the needs of the modern information society. The lack of harmonisation of exceptions hinders the circulation of knowledge based goods and services across Europe. The lack of flexibility within the current European exceptions regime also prevents us from adapting to a constantly changing technological environment.\" This ad-hoc coalition is being registered at the official EU Transparency Register in the section In-house lobbyists. Coordinator of this project runs a Brussels-based public affairs & government relations firm specialised in the online environment, that mainly mentions \"Industry\" (a.o. Google) and \"Trade Associations\" as its clients.\n\nAttempts at expansion of copyright limitations and exceptions are sometimes regarded as a threat by publishers.\n\nCopyright is typically thought of as a limited, legally sanctioned monopoly. Because of this, copyright licensing may sometimes interfere too much in free and competitive markets. These concerns are governed by legal doctrines such as competition law in the European Union, anti-trust law in the United States, and anti-monopoly law in Russia and Japan. Competition issues may arise when the licensing party unfairly leverages market power, engages in price discrimination through its licensing terms, or otherwise uses a licensing agreement in a discriminatory or unfair manner. Attempts to extend the copyright term granted by law – for example, by collecting royalties for use of the work after its copyright term has expired and it has passed into the public domain – raise such competition concerns.\n\nIn April 1995, the US published \"Antitrust Guidelines for the licensing of Intellectual Property\" which apply to patents, copyright, and trade secrets. In January 1996, the European Union published Commission Regulation No. 240/96 which applies to patents, copyright, and other intellectual property rights, especially regarding licenses. The guidelines apply \"mutatis mutandis\" to the extent possible.\n\nThe interplay of copyright law and competition law is increasingly important in the digital world, as most countries' laws allow private contracts to over-ride copyright law. Given that copyright law creates a legally sanctioned monopoly, balanced by \"limitations and exceptions\" that allow access without the permission of the copyright holder the over-riding of copyright law by private contracts can create monopoly activity. Well known limitations and exceptions include fair dealing in the UK and Canada, as well as the fair use doctrine in the US. The undermining of copyright law, and in particular limitations and exceptions to copyright by contract law is an issue frequently raised by libraries, and library groups such as International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions. As a result of this, this issue is increasingly being looked at and discussed at a national governmental level e.g. UK as well as international level such as WIPO – as part of the Development Agenda.\n\nLimitations and exceptions are also the subject of significant regulation by global treaties. These treaties have harmonized the exclusive rights which must be provided by copyright laws, and the Berne three-step test operates to constrain the kinds of copyright exceptions and limitations which individual nations can enact.\n\nOn the other hand, there are very few requirements in international copyright treaties placed on national governments to provide any exemptions from exclusive rights. One such case is Article 10(1) of the Berne Convention, which guarantees a limited right to make quotations from copyrighted works.\n\nBecause of the lack of balance in international treaties in October 2004, WIPO agreed to adopt a significant proposal offered by Argentina and Brazil, the \"Proposal for the Establishment of a Development Agenda for WIPO\" also known simply as the \"Development Agenda\" - from the Geneva Declaration on the Future of the World Intellectual Property Organization. This proposal was well supported by developing countries. A number of civil society bodies have been working on a draft Access to Knowledge, or A2K, Treaty which they would like to see introduced.\n\nTwo important examples of limitations and exceptions to copyright are the fair use doctrine found in the United States, and the fair dealing doctrine found in many other common law countries. Other more fundamental boundaries of copyright are caused by thresholds of originality, a threshold below which objects cease to be copyrightable, the idea-expression dichotomy, the public domain and the effect of Crown copyright. Even copyright maximalists might interpret these as \"defining\" copyright, rather than being \"limitations\" or \"exceptions\" to it. In addition copyright can only protect the artist's expression of his/her work and not the ideas, systems, or factual information conveyed in it. Likewise, the U.S. courts have determined that stock characters are also uncopyrightable.\n\nWhile fair use in the United States is popularly understood as the only limitation to an author's exclusive rights, it is only one of several important limitations. Section 106 of the U.S. copyright law, which defines the exclusive rights in copyrighted works, is subject to sections 107 through 122, which limit the copyright holder's exclusive rights.\n\nIn the U.S. in stark contrast to those copyright laws which have developed from English law, edicts of government are not subject to copyright, including edicts of foreign governments.\n\n"}

It is the federal agency entrusted with the implementation and enforcement of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA), which attached a per-ton fee to all extracted coal in order to fund an interest-accruing trust to be used for reclamation of abandoned mine lands, as well as established a set environmental standards that mines must follow while operating, and achieve when reclaiming mined land, in order to minimize environmental impact. OSMRE has about 500 employees, who work in either the national office in Washington, DC, or of the many regional and field offices(OSM's Three Regions).\n\nOSM has three main functions:\n\nThe OSM operates 3 regional offices:\n\nThe Appalachian region covers 12 states and is headquartered in Pittsburgh. On November 1, 1980, this office relocated into 10 Parkway West.\n\nThe Western division covers 9 states and is headquartered in Denver.\n\nThe Mid-Continent division covers 11 states and is headquartered in Alton, Illinois.\n\nThe Office of Surface Mining is responsible for the enforcement of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977; this includes setting regulatory guidelines. The actual regulation of mines is primarily done on a state level and tribal level, but OSM is charged with inspection of the state programs to meet the standard of quality. OSM regularly inspects state programs to make sure they are meeting the required standards; if they do not meet the required standards the OSM can take over. For example, when in the fiscal year of 2003 Missouri was unable to meet the federal requirements due to a lack of funding, OSM stepped in to assume partial control of the state program.\n\nOSM took control of the following in Missouri:\nOSM continued to run the above parts of Missouri's mining program until Missouri improved its program, which took place on Feb. 1, 2006. Missouri now receives federal funding.\n\nAbandoned mine lands are lands and waters adversely impacted by inadequately reclaimed surface coal mining operations on lands that were not subject to the reclamation requirements of the Surface Mining Law. Environmental problems associated with abandoned mine lands include surface and ground water pollution, entrances to open mines, water-filled pits, unreclaimed or inadequately reclaimed refuse piles and minesites (including some with dangerous highwalls), sediment-clogged streams, damage from landslides, and fumes and surface instability resulting from mine fires and burning coal refuse. Environmental restoration activities under the abandoned mine reclamation program correct or mitigate these problems.\n\nThe Appalachian Coal Country Team was founded in response to requests from watershed groups throughout coal country. The Coal Country Team arms community organizations and watershed-based projects with the training, tools, and volunteer support necessary to help local citizens become effective environmental stewards, community leaders, and accelerators of change in places indelibly marked by the environmental legacy of pre-regulatory coal mining.\n\nOSM's Bat conservation project was begun December 15, 1998, when OSM signed a MOU with Bat Conservation International, Inc. in order to establish a framework for cooperative efforts between the two organizations to maintain and increase the conservation of bats and their habitats. Under this agreement, OSM would (1) Consider the conservation of bats and their habitats in the development and implementation of abandoned mine land (AML) reclamation standards and recommendations to States and Indian Tribes; (2) Provide assistance in the development of AML programs to help manage bats and their habitats; (3) For Federal Programs, monitor non-emergency AML shaft and portal areas for bat activity prior to reclamation; (4) As appropriate, require the use of bat gates to seal the shafts of portals where bat habitation is known and would be endangered if sealed otherwise. OSM will encourage the States and Tribes to do the same; and (5) Promote the education of OSM staff, State agencies, and Indian Tribes as to: the beneficial aspects of conserving bats, tested methods to safeguard bat habitat and public health, and ways to mitigate for loss of bat roosts and habitat.\n\n\n\n"}

The word \"plank\" depicts a component of an overall political platform, as a metaphorical reference to a basic stage made out of boards or planks of wood. The metaphor can return to its literal origin when public speaking or debates are actually held upon a physical platform.\n\nA party platform is sometimes referred to as a manifesto or a political platform. Across the Western world, political parties are highly likely to fulfill their election promises.\n\nThe first known use of the word platform was in 1535. The word platform comes from Middle French \"plate-forme\", literally meaning \"flat form\". The political meaning of the word to reflect \"statement of party politics\" is from 1803, probably originally an image of a literal platform on which politicians gather, stand, and make their appeals.\n\nA 2017 study in the \"American Journal of Political Science\" found that for 12 countries (Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom, and United States) found that political parties in government fulfill their election promises to voters to a considerable extent. The study determined that:\n\nParties that hold executive office after elections generally fulfill substantial percentages, sometimes very high percentages, of their election pledges, whereas parties that do not hold executive office generally find that lower percentages of their pledges are fulfilled. The fulfillment of pledges by governing executive parties varies across governments in ways that reflect power-sharing arrangements. The main power-sharing arrangement that impacts pledge fulfillment distinguishes between single-party governments and coalitions, not between governments with and without legislative majorities. We found the highest percentages of pledge fulfillment for governing parties in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Portugal, Spain, and Canada, most of which governed in single-party executives. We found lower percentages for governing parties in Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Bulgaria, Ireland, and Italy, most of which governed in coalitions. Pledge fulfillment by U.S. presidential parties lies at the higher end of coalition governments, which suggests that U.S. presidents are more constrained than governing parties in single-party parliamentary systems, but less constrained than most governing parties in multiparty coalitions.Other research on the United States suggests that Democratic and Republican congresspeople voted in line with their respective party platforms 74% and 89% of the time, respectively.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "25349142", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25349142", "title": "Public budgeting", "text": "Public budgeting\n\nPublic budgeting is a field of public administration and a discipline in the academic study thereof. Budgeting is characterized by its approaches, functions, formation, and type.\n\nAuthors Robert W. Smith and Thomas D. Lynch describe public budgeting through four perspectives. The politician sees the budget process as \"a political event conducted in the political arena for political advantage\". The economist views budgeting as a matter of allocating resources in terms of opportunity cost where allocating resources to one consumer takes resources away from another consumer. The role of the economist, therefore, is to provide decision makers with the best possible information. The accountant perspective focuses on the accountability value in budgeting which analyzes the amount budgeted to the actual expenditures thereby describing the \"wisdom of the original policy\". Smith and Lynch's public manager's perspective on a budget is a policy tool to describe the implementation of public policy. Further, they develop an operational definition:\n\nA \"budget\" is a \"plan\" for the accomplishment of \"programs\" related to \"objectives\" and \"goals\" within a definite \"time\" period, including an estimate of \"resources required\", together with an estimate of \"resources available\", usually compared with one or more \"past periods\" and \"showing future requirements\".\n\n\n\nA brief note on Systems Theory applied to Political Science: Inputs enter the governmental system that produces outputs which—in turn—are related to outcomes. The conversion of inputs to outputs is a measure of efficiency as the measurement of contributing inputs to impacting outcomes is a measure of efficacy.\n\nAs a policy document, a government's budget is designed as a plan for implementing its policy. Traditionally, budgets served as a more rigid tool to implement policy in a retrospective setting. The functions associated with these values are listed under the Traditional Model and are control, management, and planning. The Modern Model, taking a less rigid approach, has replaced the control function with the monitoring function, the management function with the steering function, and the planning function with the strategic brokering function.\n\nto the traditional control function, the monitoring function focuses on the \"consequences\" of expenditures.\n\nSteering: as a response to the traditional management function, the steering function serves as a \"guide\" for managing.\nStrategic Brokering uses the budget document as a means of constantly looking for possible directions and reacting to the environment.\n\nThree values are generally discussed in the literature of public budgeting: accountability, efficiency, and efficacy.\n\nAccountability focuses on the inputs going into the system or program in action and is best characterized by the line-item budgeting approach. It is best suited for the control and monitoring functions of a budget.\n\nEfficiency focuses on the process of the system or program and its conversion of inputs (resources) into outputs (policy). Its focus on the process makes this value appropriate for performance budgets and most in-line with management and steering functions.\n\nEfficacy focuses on outputs and outcomes, measuring the impact of policy. This value follows both the program budget and PPBS budget approaches and coincides with the planning and strategic brokering functions.\n\nTypically, the budget cycles occurs in four phases. The first requires policy planning and resource analysis and includes revenue estimation. The second phase is referred to as policy formulation and includes the negotiation and planning of the budget formation. The third phase is policy execution which follows budget adoption is budget execution—the implementation and revision of budgeted policy. The fourth phase encompasses the entire budget process, but is considered its fourth phase. This phase is auditing and evaluating the entire process and system.

For example, a party in a court case may obtain copies of e-mail messages sent by employees of the opposing party. \n\nThe responding party is required to furnish copies of any documents that are responsive to the request, except for those that are legally privileged. The responding party also can submit a response to the requestor explaining why the documents cannot be produced.

With the Handover imminent in 1997, the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law defined who may reside in Hong Kong once China assumes sovereignty over Hong Kong.\n\nSince Hong Kong was created a British colony in 1842, those who were born in the territory or become naturalised had British nationality. This included the right to enter and live in United Kingdom in addition to Hong Kong.\n\nBy the 1960s, the United Kingdom passed the \"Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962\" and \"Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968\". Anticipating immigration waves from former and current colonies in Africa and Asia with the decolonisation of the 1960s, the British government tightened immigration control into the United Kingdom and Islands (the UK, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man). As such, British nationals connected to Hong Kong were subjected to immigration control since 1962 and no longer had the right of abode in the United Kingdom.\n\nUntil 1997, British nationality related closely with the permanent resident status which guaranteed right of abode. Hong Kong permanent residents had British nationality either by birth, naturalisation or by descent. The type of British citizenship connected to Hong Kong eventually evolved to become different from that of the United Kingdom. What has not changed is the definition that a Hong Kong permanent resident has the right of abode in Hong Kong.\n\nThere was no immigration restriction into Hong Kong until 1950. People were free to travel across the Hong Kong-Chinese border. With the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the Hong Kong government decided to close the border and implement immigration control in an attempt to stem waves of immigrants and refugees. The government also began to register Hong Kong residents to issue compulsory identity cards. The Hong Kong ID card is proof of legal residency still in use today.\n\nNevertheless, the immigration boom intensified throughout the 50s and 60s with the onset of the Cultural Revolution. The government adopted the Touch Base Policy in 1974 and began repatriating immigrants intercepted at the border. The government had abolished the policy by 1980 and began repatriating all illegal immigrants once discovered.\n\nEven though the PRC maintains ethnic Chinese of Hong Kong are Chinese nationals, Hong Kong residents were subjected to immigration controls when entering the PRC and had no right of abode in the mainland. There was also a quota for PRC residents to apply for a One-way Permit under special circumstances to immigrate to Hong Kong.\nMany Vietnamese people sought refuge in Hong Kong as a result of war and persecution in Vietnam that began in the mid-1970s. Backed by a Hong Kong Government humanitarian policy, and under the auspices of the United Nations, some Vietnamese were permitted to settle in Hong Kong. Between 1975 and 1999, 143,700 Vietnamese refugees were resettled in other countries and more than 67,000 Vietnamese migrants were repatriated. The illegal entry of Vietnamese refugees remained an issue for the Hong Kong government for 25 years. Finally in 2000, the government announced that it would widen the Local Resettlement Scheme for Vietnamese refugees and migrants, allowing the last remaining 1,400 refugees and migrants to settle in Hong Kong, granting them the right of abode.\n\nThe Sino-British Joint Declaration signed on 19 December 1984 stated that the PRC would assume sovereignty over the entire ceded territory of Hong Kong on 1 July 1997.\n\nThe terms \"right of abode\" first appeared in Annex I of the Declaration as the government of the People's Republic of China elaborated its basic policies regarding Hong Kong. Section XIV—concerning right of abode, travel, and immigration—stated:\nThe following categories of persons shall have the right of abode in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and, in accordance with the law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, be qualified to obtain permanent identity cards issued by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, which state their right of abode:\n\nDrafted in accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Hong Kong Basic Law was adopted on 4 April 1990 by the Seventh National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, and went into effect on 1 July 1997.\n\nCertain classes of people hold Hong Kong Permanent Resident status, and hence the right of abode, by virtue of Article 24 of the Basic law. (Others may have the right of abode by statute). The Article lists the following classes:\n\n\nOn the other hand, Article 22 states that for the purpose of entry into Hong Kong, people from other parts of China must apply for approval. Among them, the number of persons who enter the Region for the purpose of settlement shall be determined by the authorities of the Central People's Government after consulting the Hong Kong government.\n\nUnder the Immigration Ordinance, a Chinese national applying for permanent residence and the right of abode under (2) above may qualify on the basis of any seven-year period in Hong Kong, while a non-Chinese national applying under (4) may only qualify on the basis of seven years immediately preceding the application. The latter requirement was challenged in \"Fateh Muhammad v. Commissioner of Registration\" as discriminatory and inconsistent with the Basic Law, but was upheld in the Court of Final Appeal in 2001.\n\nThe Hong Kong Basic Law came into effect on 1 July 1997, along with the right of abode eligibility defined therein. Most Hong Kong residents became solely Chinese citizens on 1 July 1997 and continued to maintain their right of abode in Hong Kong held before the Handover. Non-Chinese citizens with Hong Kong right of abode maintained their original citizenship unless they successfully naturalised as Chinese citizens.\n\nThe issue of who has the right of abode in Hong Kong prompted a fierce debate at the end of the 20th century and tested the \"one country, two systems\" policy towards Hong Kong of the People's Republic of China. On 29 January 1999, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal ruled in \"Ng Ka Ling\" and \"Chan Kam Nga\" that children of permanent residents had the right of abode, including children born in mainland China and children whose parents had not been permanent residents at the time of the child's birth. These decisions would have granted immediate right of abode to up to 300,000 people in mainland China, depending upon whether family unification would have been limited to children under a certain age, or extended to all people.\n\nMany political commentators claimed that Hong Kong would experience a surge in people claiming the right of abode from mainland China, possibly disrupting the economy of Hong Kong. The fear of massive influx of mainlanders soon raised widespread public concern. As a response, the Hong Kong Government asked the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to reinterpret Articles 22(4) and 24(2)(3) of Hong Kong's Basic Law, which effectively overturned the court decision. This move sparked large protests and debate over whether or not the judiciary of Hong Kong remained independent from the government of mainland China. On 3 December 1999, the Court of Final Appeal ruled that the NPC's interpretation of the Basic Law was constitutional. The Court's decision denied almost all people listed as plaintiffs, including those already in Hong Kong since the first week of 1997, the right of abode.\n\nAccording to Article 24 of the Basic Law, Chinese nationals may acquire the right of abode in Hong Kong \"inter alia\" by one of the following three ways:\n\nMany from Hong Kong had moved to mainland China and started families. Under the immigration law prior to 1 July 1997, their children born in mainland China had no right of abode in Hong Kong. After the Basic Law came into effect, the government of Hong Kong realised that Article 24(2)(3) would have allowed thousands of children in mainland China, who previously had no right of abode in Hong Kong, to immigrate to Hong Kong. Many children who had already illegally come to Hong Kong or overstayed their visas presented themselves to immigration authorities and claimed that they were entitled to stay in Hong Kong under Article 24(2)(3).\n\nIn response, the Legislative Council proposed to restrict the right of such persons by adding another requirement that one of the child's parents must have been a permanent resident at the time of the child's birth. On 10 July 1997, the Legislative Council passed the Immigration Amendment (No. 3) Ordinance, which introduced a certification system. Under this system, any person who claimed to have the right of abode in Hong Kong could prove their status only by showing a certificate of right of abode issued by the Director of Immigration of Hong Kong. This certificate could be applied for only in mainland China, and it would not be issued until the application obtained a one-way permit to cross the border to Hong Kong from the Chinese Public Security Bureau. The amendment was made retroactive to 1 July 1997, which meant that even children who had already arrived in Hong Kong with previously sufficient legal documentation would have been stripped of their right for lack of a certificate that did not yet exist when they entered Hong Kong. The retroactivity of the amendment triggered a number of test cases in court, which eventually came before the Court of Final Appeal as \"Ng Ka Ling v. Director of Immigration\" and \"Chan Kam Nga v. Director of Immigration\".\n\nIn \"Ng Ka Ling v. Director of Immigration\", the Court of Final Appeal was asked to rule on whether the No. 3 Ordinance was unconstitutional. The Director argued that the No. 3 Ordinance was constitutional because Article 24 was qualified by Article 22(4), which provides: \"For entry into the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, people from other parts of China must apply for approval. Among them, the number of persons who enter the Region for the purpose of settlement shall be determined by the competent authorities of the Central People's Government after consulting the government of the Region.\"\n\nIn \"Chan Kam Nga v. Director of Immigration\", the Court of Final Appeal was asked to rule on the following question: \"can a child become a Hong Kong permanent resident under category (3) of Article 24 of the Basic Law by virtue of a parent's Hong Kong permanent resident status under category (2) of that article not only if such status of the parent's had been acquired \"before\" the child's birth but even if it had not been acquired until \"after\" the child's birth?\"\n\nOn 29 January 1999, the Court of Final Appeal gave its judgment, which affirmed some fundamental constitutional principles. The Court held that the Basic Law was a living instrument which, like any other constitution, should be interpreted using a generous and purposive approach. The Court rejected the idea that Article 22(4) qualified the right of abode in Article 24(2)(3), since \"people from other parts of China\" mentioned in Article 22(4) do not include permanent residents of Hong Kong, and therefore Article 22(4) does not concern those who otherwise have a valid claim to be a permanent resident. A scheme to verify the claim of right of abode was in itself constitutional, but such a scheme should not have been used to deny valid claims.\n\nThe Court also held that in considering any particular provision, the courts should take into account the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) as it applied to Hong Kong. The Court found that Article 15(1) of the ICCPR rendered the retrospective provision unconstitutional. The Court also found that the ICCPR enshrined the principle of equality and recognised the importance of family, hence illegitimate children enjoy the right of abode as much as other children.\n\nOn the same day, the Court gave its judgment on \"Chan Kam Nga\". The Court held that, as a matter of construction of Article 24, a child born \"after\" his or her parent became a permanent resident nevertheless enjoys the right of abode.\n\nBased on the ruling, the Hong Kong Government estimated that the additional eligible persons in Mainland China who can obtain the right of abode (and therefore can immigrate to Hong Kong) within ten years would reach 1.6 million, and would result in very severe social and economic problems. While some questioned the methodology of the survey, opinion polls conducted revealed widespread concerns among the public on the consequences.\n\nA number of persons in the legal sector believed that the best way forward was to seek the National People's Congress (NPC) of the People's Republic of China to amend the part of the Basic Law to redress the problem. They argued that judgment has correctly reflected the true legislative intent of Articles 22(4) and 24(2)(3) of the Basic Law, and there are precedents in common law jurisdictions to repudiate a court judgment by means of legislative amendment. However, the Government pointed out (in May 1999) the disadvantages of such option, that since the NPC would meet only once a year in March, a large number of ROA claimants would have flooded Hong Kong by then, and also the Basic Law, as a constitutional document, should not be amended lightly before other options are fully explored.\n\nBased on the above, the Hong Kong Government sought interpretation of, rather than amendment to, the Basic Law from the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC). The power of interpretation of the Basic Law by the NPCSC is explicitly provided under Article 158(1) of the Basic Law. However, no mechanisms are explicitly provided under that Article for the Government to take the initiative to seek an interpretation. (The Article provides only that the Court should seek an interpretation if it comes across Basic Law provisions concerning affairs under the responsibility of the Central Government or its relationship with the HKSAR before the final judgment. Article 22 in question is arguably one of such provisions).\n\nFormer chief executive, Tung Chee Hwa, announced measures to be taken by the Government, which was to seek the assistance of the State Council to approach the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) to interpret the Basic Law provisions concerning the right of abode. Commentators have widely commented that this is in contravention of Article 158 which stipulates the body that should seek an interpretation from the NPCSC is the Court of Final Appeal. Although the government, after the judgment of Lau Kong Yung & Others v Director of Immigration was handed down, claimed that \"the Court had confirmed that the Government had acted entirely constitutionally and legally\" in requesting a NPCSC interpretation, the truth is the Court never endorsed or ratified the Government's acts. In the judgment, the Court affirmed that the NPCSC had unqualified power to interpret the Basic Law, but never discussed the issue as to whether the reference was legal. Therefore, this issue cannot be regarded as settled.\n\nOn 26 June 1999, in line with the request of the HKSAR Government, the NPCSC issued its interpretation which makes it clear that children born outside Hong Kong will be eligible for the right of abode only if at least one of their parents has already acquired permanent residence status at the time of their birth. Also, those eligible for ROA need to comply with Article 22 of the Basic Law, i.e. they need to apply for the necessary approval from the relevant Mainland authorities before entry into Hong Kong.\n\nSome have argued that the judicial independence of Hong Kong is undermined by the act of Government seeking an interpretation of the Basic Law \"after\" a judgment by the judiciary has been made. (Some critics dubbed this a \"re-interpretation\" of the Basic Law). In addition, the fact that NPC is the law-making body of People's Republic of China has prompted critics to argue that the principle of One country, two systems is endangered. The Government argued otherwise. In its paper Right of Abode, The Solution, the problems facing the HKSAR, the options, and the considerations leading to the decision were elaborated. The Secretary for Justice, Elsie Leung, further defended Government's decision in her speech to the Legislative Council after announcing the decision.\n\nOthers have argued that regardless of the merits of the case, it was politically unwise for those worried about Hong Kong legal autonomy to use this as a test case to assert Hong Kong's judicial independence, since it is the general consensus that the Hong Kong public tended to support the position of the SAR government as well as the legal interpretation of the NPCSC.\n\nDifferences in opinion remain as to whether Hong Kong's judicial independence and the rule of law have been undermined. Criticism of the interpretation has originated largely from the legal sector.\n\nGladys Li, a Hong Kong Senior Counsel and a member of Civic Party, helped three Filipino families to apply for judicial review at High Court, to challenge the restriction stated in the Immigration Ordinances for foreign domestic helpers who have seven years' continuous ordinary residence in Hong Kong through working to apply for permanent residency. It has sparked a hot debate among the public in Hong Kong.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2508823", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2508823", "title": "Section 25 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms", "text": "Section 25 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\n\nSection 25 of the \"Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\" is the first section under the heading \"General\" in the \"Charter\", and like other sections within the \"General\" sphere, it aids in the interpretation of rights elsewhere in the \"Charter\". While section 25 is also the Charter section that deals most directly with Aboriginal peoples in Canada, it does not create or constitutionalize rights for them.\n\nThe \"Charter\" is a part of the larger \"Constitution Act, 1982\". Aboriginal rights, including treaty rights, receive more direct constitutional protection under section 35 of the \"Constitution Act, 1982.\"\n\nUnder the heading \"General,\" the section reads:\n\nIn other words, the \"Charter\" must be enforced in a way that does not diminish Aboriginal rights. As the Court of Appeal for Ontario held in \"R. v. Agawa\" (1988), the section \"confers no new rights,\" but instead \"shields\" old ones.\n\nThis is a stronger recognition for non-\"Charter\" rights than section 26's requirement that the \"Charter\" cannot be interpreted to deny that non-\"Charter\" rights exist, as section 25 specifically states that Aboriginal rights will not only continue to exist but also cannot be derogated \"by the Charter itself\". The distinction came about during the negotiations of the \"Charter\". Section 25's content did not appear in the first version of the \"Charter\", in October 1980, but the original version of what later became section 26 did say that the existence of Aboriginal rights could not be denied. This sparked dramatic protests among Aboriginals, who viewed the proposed constitutional amendments as an insufficient protection of their rights. This persisted until some of their leaders, the National Indian Brotherhood, the Inuit Tapirisat of Canada, and the Native Council of Canada (now the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples), were appeased by the addition of sections 25 and 35 to the \"Constitution Act, 1982.\"\n\nThe rights to which section 25 refers explicitly include those in the Royal Proclamation of 1763. They may also include those created by ordinary legislation, like the \"Indian Act\", and constitutional scholar Peter Hogg has speculated that without this section, section 15 (the equality provision) would have possibly threatened these rights, since they are particular to a race. Nevertheless, in the Supreme Court case \"Corbiere v. Canada\" (1999), it was found that not all legislative distinctions relating to Aboriginals are protected by section 25, and section 15 was accordingly used to extend voting rights in Aboriginal reserves to Aboriginals who did not live in those reserves. As Hogg observes, what particular rights section 25 protects was in the mean time left uncertain.\n\nSection 35 of the Constitution Act, which falls outside the \"Charter\", \"does\" constitutionalize some aboriginal rights. As Hogg notes, this makes section 25 altogether less important than section 35, but \"Corbiere\" leaves open the possibility that rights not constitutionalized by section 35 can have some protection under section 25.\n\nThe question of how the \"Charter\" applies to Aboriginals and Aboriginal government has involved section 25. On the one hand, it has been argued that Aboriginal governments are not bound by the \"Charter\". If section 35 includes a right to self-government, and section 25 ensures Aboriginal rights are not limited by the \"Charter\", then section 25 would also guarantee that self-government is not limited by the \"Charter\". On the other hand, the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples once argued that while section 25 guarantees the existence of self-government itself, the powers of such Aboriginal governments will be limited to respect the \"Charter\" rights of individual Aboriginals.\n\nSome bands receive a measure of autonomy under the \"Indian Act\", and the consequent powers of the councils would be protected by section 25. Meanwhile, section 32, which bounds the federal and provincial governments to the \"Charter\", may not include the band councils if their authority derives not only from the \"Indian Act\" but also tradition.\n\nIn 1983, with the passing of the \"Constitution Amendment Proclamation, 1983\", section 25 was amended to expand the protection provided for rights associated with land claims. Whereas the original wording made reference to rights acquired \"by way of land claim settlement,\" the current version refers to rights that \"now exist by way of land claims agreements or may be so acquired.\" While ordinarily, section 25 could have been amended with the standard 7/50 amending formula, this change was also carried out with agreement of aboriginal leaders. At the same time, the Constitution Act, 1982 was amended to add section 35.1. This new section suggests that, before section 25 is amended in the future, consultation with aboriginal leaders will again be requested by the prime minister.\n\nScholar Celeste Hutchinson remarks in an article that little has been done with section 25 by the courts. However, she points to the British Columbia Court of Appeal case \"R. v. Kapp\" as one that discusses section 25's application. She argues \"Kapp\" failed to resolve the issue of whether section 25 is only applied when the Charter is violated, or if applies earlier, when a Charter challenge is raised. Nevertheless, Hutchinson did feel \"Kapp\" provided some significant discussion of section 25. In \"Kapp\", Justice Kirkpatrick endorsed the view that section 25 is first considered when a Charter challenge is raised, and made a three-step test asking (1) is the right in question a treaty, Aboriginal or other right related to Aboriginals? (2) if it falls in the \"other\" category, does it relate to a part of Aboriginal life? (3) would the remedy possibly given by the Charter limit Aboriginal rights?\n"}

At the beginning of the Civil War he served as a captain in the New Model Army under Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex and was eventually promoted to the rank of colonel. He distinguished himself at the Battle of Preston in 1648 and with his regiment took part in the military occupation of London in December 1648, which was the first step towards bringing to trial of King Charles I (1625-1649).\n\nThe next step was the expulsion of the Presbyterian and Royalist elements in the House of Commons, who were thought to be prepared to reach a settlement with Charles. This, resolved by the army council and ordered by the lord general, Fairfax, was carried out by Colonel Pride's regiment. Taking his stand at the entrance of the House of Commons with a written list in his hand, he caused the arrest or exclusion of the members, who were pointed out to him. After about a hundred members had been thus dealt with, the reduced House of Commons, now reduced to about eighty in number, proceeded to bring the king to trial. This marked the end of the Long Parliament and the beginning of the Rump Parliament.\n\nPride was one of the judges of the king and one of the Regicides of King Charles I, having signed and sealed the king's death-warrant. His coat of arms appears on his seal.\n\nHe commanded an infantry brigade under Cromwell at the Battle of Dunbar (1650) and at the Battle of Worcester (1651). He purchased the estate of Nonsuch Palace in Surrey, and in 1655 was appointed Sheriff of Surrey.\n\nWhen the Commonwealth was established he abandoned his involvement in politics, except in opposing the proposal to confer the kingly dignity on Cromwell. In 1656 he was knighted by Cromwell, then Lord Protector, and was appointed to the second house added to Parliament as a result of the Humble Petition and Advice.\n\nHe married Elizabeth Monk (born 1628), a daughter of Thomas Monk of Potheridge in Devon by his wife Mary Gould, a daughter of William Gould of Hayes. Elizabeth's uncle was the royalist general George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle (1608-1670), KG, the key figure in effecting the Restoration of the Monarchy to King Charles II in 1660.\n\nPride died in 1658 at his home of Worcester Park House, having bought it and the \"Great Park\" of Nonsuch Palace, Surrey. After the Restoration of 1660 his body was ordered dug up and suspended on the gallows at Tyburn along with those of Cromwell, Henry Ireton and John Bradshaw, though it is said that the sentence was not carried out, probably because his corpse was too far decayed. The Royalists thereupon attempted to hang his son, Joseph Pride, also an active member of the New Model Army, who barely escaped.\n\n"}

{"id": "1440903", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1440903", "title": "Wu Qi", "text": "Wu Qi\n\nWu Qi (, 440-381 BC) was a Chinese military leader, Legalist philosopher, and politician in the Warring States period.\n\nBorn in the State of Wei (衞), he was skilled in leading armies and military strategy. He had served in the states of Lu and Wei (魏, not to be confused with Wèi, as in previous note). In the state of Wei he commanded many great battles and was appointed Xihe Shou (Mayor of Xihe county). Xihe was the area between the Yellow and Luo Rivers that Wei had just taken from Qin. Later, after he became estranged from the lord of Wei and was forced into exile, Wu Qi went to the State of Chu where he was appointed Prime minister by King Dao of Chu (楚悼王). His reforms made Chu a strong state at that time. The reforms he instituted enraged the old nobility of Chu and he was killed after the death of King Dao.\n\nWu's reforms, which started around 389 BC, were generally aimed at changing the corrupt and inefficient government. The nobility and officialdom were terribly corrupt and the government was burdened with the costs of paying them and a horde of other minor officials. Wu first lowered the annual salary of Chu officials, then dismissed officials who were useless or incompetent. He also eliminated hereditary privileges after three generations. The money saved by cutting costs was used to create and train a more professional army.\n\nAnother of Wu's actions was to move all the nobles to the borders on the frontier, away from the capital, in order to reduce their power and at the same time populate those areas, making them more useful to the state government. He is also credited with devising a set of building codes in Ying, in order to make the city look less \"barbaric\", and more in line with 'civilized' Chinese architectural aesthetics.\n\nAlthough his reforms soon started to make Chu a powerful country, the nobles and Daoists of Chu hated him. Nobles accused him of trying to change the old ways, and even managed to find fault with the building codes. Daoists accused him of being a \"warmonger\" and an \"admirer of force and weaponry\", even going as far as to say that he was \"a threat to humanity\". He was accused of not returning for the mourning period of his mother's death and for murdering his own wife (who was the daughter of a noble from the rival state of Qi) in order to gain trust from the ruler of the state of Lu. There is no definitive evidence to the truth of these accusations, and it is possible they were manufactured by Wu Qi's political enemies to slander him.\n\nIn the wake of Wu Qi's reforms, Chu's prowess was quickly manifest: Chu defeated the Yue state in the south and the Wei in the north, dealing with each in quick succession. However, King Dao died that same year. The old nobles plotted to assassinate Wu Qi at King Dao's funeral, where he would be separated from the army. Wu Qi spotted the assassins armed with bows, and rushed to the side of King Dao's body. He was killed, but many arrows struck the dead King. The new King Su (楚肃王), furious at his father's body being mutilated, ordered all nobles involved to be executed, along with their families.\n\nAccording to the Wei Liaozi, a treatise on military matters dating from the late 4th or early 3rd century BC, the general Wu Qi was once offered a sword by his subordinates on the eve of battle. However Wu Qi refused to accept the weapon on the basis that banners and drums, the tools to lead and command, were the only instruments a general required. In his words, \"to command the troops and direct their blades, this is the role of a commander. To wield a single sword is not his role.\" The point here is to highlight the idea that the general was the brain of the army, whereas the soldiers were to behave as the limbs. Heroic individual actions were disincentivized in preference to complete obedience and perfect coordination as a unit, a concept which the Wei Liaozi elucidates upon in another parable concerning Wu Qi: Prior to the beginning of a battle, one of Wu's soldiers broke from his ranks in his enthusiasm and charged the enemy line, slaying two men, and trotted back to his former position along with their heads as trophies. Wu immediately ordered the man to be put to death. When his officers protested that he was a fine warrior, Wu Qi answered, \"He is indeed a fine warrior, but he disobeyed my orders.\" As with Sun Zi and his Art of War, Wu Qi emphasized discipline and obedience before bravery as the most important traits in soldiery.\n\nHe and Sun Zi are often mentioned in the same sentence (Sun-Wu, 孙武) as great military strategists of similar if not equal importance.\n\nHis military treatise, the \"Wuzi\", is included as one of the \"Seven Military Classics\". It is said there were two books on the art of war by Wu Qi, but one was lost, hence leaving the Wuzi as the only existing book carrying Wu Qi's military thoughts.\n\nWu Qi is one of the 32 historical figures who appear as special characters in the video game series \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms (video game)\" by Koei.\n\n\n"}
