Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.\n\nIn Montenegro, access to information is a right guaranteed by the Constitution and regulated under the law. Montenegro first adopted the Law on Free Access to Information in 2005; in 2013 a new law entered into force, providing a better standard of protection for freedom of information than the previous legal act. However, despite some positive developments achieved with the adoption of the new Law, Montenegro still has problems with its implementation.\n\nRecently, Montenegro started the process of reforming the current law: a draft proposal was formulated by the Culture of Ministry in 2016 following some pressure from the European Union to align Montenegrin legislation with EU standards.\n\nThe Constitution of Montenegro states, in Article 51, that everyone shall have the right of access to public information held by state authorities and organisations exercising public functions. Furthermore, the 2013 Law on Free Access to Information establishes a precise procedure for obtaining public information. The law entitles any natural or legal person the right to access information held in any form by state and local authorities, public companies and other entities which exercise public functions. Public authorities have 15 working days for deciding on the disclosure of a required information.\n\nThe new law introduced a new supervisory body, called Agency for the Protection of Personal Data and Free Access to Information which works on the appeal process of freedom of information requests. Another positive development in the 2013 law is the introduction of fines to be imposed upon public bodies which fail to fulfill with their duties with regard to access to information.\n\nAccording to the 2016 European Commission Progress Report on Montenegro, the law on Access to public information lack effective monitoring and supervision. According to the newspaper Vijesti, the experience of journalists and NGOs in the country shows that, despite FOI legal provisions, in practice it is difficult to get information of public importance. \n\nIn the last years the proportion of requests refused by public authorities in Montenegro improved from 24% in 2014 to 18% in 2015. Also, the 2016 budget of the Agency for the Protection of Personal Data and Access to Information was increased by 50%. The limited capacity and resources of the Agency was an issue of concern for some NGOs advocating for access to information.\n\nIn 2015, out of a total of 4.434 requests for access to information, the information requested was not provided in 805 cases. The Agency for Personal Data Protection and Free Access to Information received a total of 1.431 complaints in 2015. The majority of cases received by the Agency concerned administrative silence: in these cases the request remained unanswered.\n\nThe majority of FOI requests, around 70%, are filed by NGOs, among which stands the NGO MANS. This data shows the low awareness and knowledge by the general public of the right of access to information and its legal provisions. In the majority of cases applicants are get the required information with large delays, beyond the time frame established by the law, and often after having filed a complaint to the Ombudsbam.\n\nAnother issue of concern is that court decisions on cases concerning access to information are not effectively enforced. The report of the EC also points out that in some cases public authorities in Montenegro seem to abuse the possibility of declaring requested documents confidential in order to avoid their disclosure. Indeed, according to the NGO MANS, the law includes a series of unnecessary reasons for exceptions for limiting disclosure. The formulation of the exceptions enshrined in the law seems to be too vague and too general, thus giving room for public institutions to interpret it in a way that restricts access to information.\n\nAnother reason of concern is the high percentage of requests that remain unanswered.\n\nAccording to the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN), problems in realizing the right of access to public information arise in particular when journalists and NGOs seek information about the privatization process or seek information that could potentially reveal cases of corruption or illegal activity. According to the NGO MANS, the respect of the law on access to public information is particularly problematic when it comes to make public information concerning enterprises where the State owns the majority of shares.\n\nThe EC Progress Report recommends to enhance the implementation of the law especially in corruption-prone cases.\n\n"}

Grumet, 512 U.S. 687 (1994), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court ruled on the constitutionality of a school district created with boundaries that matched that of a religious community.\n\nThe court, in an opinion by Justice Souter, held that the creation of a school district unit of government designed to coincide with the neighborhood boundaries of a religious group constitutes an unconstitutional aid to religion. Souter concluded that \"government should not prefer one religion to another, or religion to irreligion.\" \"There is more than a fine line between the voluntary association that leads to a political community comprising people who share a common religious faith, and the forced separation that occurs when the government draws explicit political boundaries on the basis of peoples'\nfaith. In creating the district in question, New York crossed that line.\"\n\nJustice Scalia, in his dissent, acknowledged that the residents of this district are Satmar Hasidic Jews, but noted of the Satmar community:\n\n[A]ll its residents also wear unusual dress, have unusual civic customs, and have not much to do with people who are culturally different from them ... On what basis does Justice Souter conclude that it is the theological distinctiveness rather than the cultural distinctiveness that was the basis for New York State's decision? The normal assumption would be that it was the latter, since it was not theology but dress, language, and cultural alienation that posed the educational problem for the children.\n\nScalia argued that the Satmar school district aided the Satmars as a culture rather than a religion, and thus did not constitute impermissible aid to a religious group. The majority, Scalia asserted, would \"laud this humanitarian legislation if all of the distinctiveness of the students of Kiryas Joel were attributable to the fact that their parents were nonreligious commune dwellers, or American Indians, or Gypsies,\" and concluded that \"creation of a special, one-culture school district for the benefit of those children would pose no problem. The neutrality demanded by the Religion Clauses requires the same indulgence towards cultural characteristics that are accompanied by religious belief.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "37023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37023", "title": "Conservatorship", "text": "Conservatorship\n\nConservatorship is a legal concept in the United States. A guardian or a protector is appointed by a judge to manage the financial affairs and/or daily life of another due to physical or mental limitations, or old age. A person under conservatorship is a \"conservatee,\" a term that can refer to an adult. A person under guardianship is a \"ward,\" a term that can also refer to a minor child.\n\nThe conservator may be only of the \"estate\" (financial affairs), but may be also of the \"person,\" wherein the conservator takes charge of overseeing the daily activities, such as health care or living arrangements of the conservatee. A conservator of the person is more typically called a legal guardian.\n\nConservatorship is established either by court order (with regard to individuals) or via a statutory or regulatory authority (with regard to organizations such as business entities). In other legal terms, a conservatorship may refer to the legal responsibilities over a person who is mentally disordered, including individuals who are psychotic, suicidal, demented, incapacitated, or in some other way unable to make legal, medical or financial decisions on behalf of themselves.\n\nWhen referring to government control of private corporations such as Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae, conservatorship implies a more temporary control than does nationalization.\n\nConservatorship is a legal term referring to the legal responsibilities of a conservator over the affairs of a person who has been deemed gravely disabled by the court and unable to meet his or her basic needs of food, clothing, and shelter. They are governed by the state's individual laws. Terminology varies, and some states or jurisdictions may refer to a conservator as a guardian of the estate or as a trustee.\n\nConservatorships are generally put in place for severely mentally ill individuals who are gravely disabled, elderly individuals with dementia or Alzheimer's disease who lack mental capacity, or individuals with developmental disabilities who may or may not lack mental capacity. Mental capacity normally must to be evaluated by a medical physician or a psychiatrist experienced in the field and is documented and provided to the court as evidence.\n\nIn the state of California there are two types of conservatorships: Lanterman–Petris–Short (Lanterman–Petris–Short Act of 1967, referred to as LPS) and Probate conservatorships. These forms of conservatorship are governed by the California Probate Code, and Welfare and Institutions Codes.\n\nA \"limited conservatorship\" usually refers to the limited legal responsibilities of a conservator over the affairs of an individual who is developmentally disabled, but still capable of making important decisions for himself or herself. In these cases, the conservatee to whom the limited conservatorship applies can retain more control over his or her personal affairs than other conservatees can; for example, he or she may retain his or her right to decide where he or she may live.\n\nAn example of a conservator's duties includes: locating and marshalling assets, such as property and money, which belong to the conservatee; using the assets to buy food for the conservatee, secure and pay for placement in a facility which would take care of the conservatee or treat a mental illness, pay bills for the conservatee, manage property by paying for property insurance, mortgage payments or rent, property clean-up, or pay for a property management company to rent the property. An example of a conservator or guardian's medical responsibilities would be the court granting medical authority to the conservator or guardian, and the conservator or guardian authorizing a physician to place a feeding tube to provide nourishment into the protected person's stomach if they are in medical need of it. It is not uncommon for one person to hold both offices and be referred to as the \"guardian and conservator\" of the conservatee, even though a conservator or guardian can be appointed over the person only, the estate only, or both. Generally, a conservator or guardian over the estate is only appointed if the conservatee has assets that need to be protected, marshalled, and managed. These terms may be found in use in U.P.C. jurisdictions, even though the U.P.C. uses the term \"protected person\" in either case.\n\nIn most states, an outside party or agency must review the facts of the case and submit a report, usually required to be in writing, to the court before the court makes a decision on the request to establish a conservatorship or guardianship. Usually the outside party is a local County Mental Health representative called an investigator. They are often required to be experts in some appropriate field, such as social work, mental health, a medical field, or law. Procedures for conservatorship of an adult are often different from those for minors. \n\nThe court may appoint an attorney to represent the proposed conservatee or ward. If the proposed conservatee or ward is unable to have an attorney-client relationship because of some impairment, the court may appoint a guardian-ad-litem (who is often also an attorney). A guardian-ad-litem does not take instruction from the client, but rather acts on their behalf and tells the court what they think is in the best interests of the proposed conservatee or ward, whether or not that is what the proposed conservatee or ward wants. The conservatee has the right to be represented by an attorney, and if they cannot afford a private attorney, they are appointed a public defender that will represent them free of cost.\n\nLPS conservatorships begin with a temporary 30-day conservatorship, and if the conservatee remains gravely disabled, the conservator is reappointed for a year; the LPS conservatorship can be renewed annually, or terminated if no longer needed. Probate conservatorships are referred to as \"general conservatorships\", and typically do not have a temporary period unless an urgent emergency exists that is creating risk to the person or their estate. Probate conservatorship do not automatically expire as LPS conservatorships do if they are not renewed by the conservator.\n\nIn an LPS conservatorship, a court-appointed conservator over the person is responsible for managing the conservatee's placement, medical decisions, and mental health treatment. A conservator over the estate is responsible for marshalling, protecting, and managing the conservatee's assets that remain in their estate. A conservator reports to the court that appointed them, and is monitored by the supervising judicial court in the county in which the conservatee permanently resides.\n\nLPS conservatorships usually begin in the County Mental Health system and are referred from acute psychiatric hospitals, where Probate conservatorships can result from any referral source if validated with property medical documentation. Mental Health consumers have the right to a Patient's Rights advocate, and are taken through a series of hearings while they are in the acute hospital before they reach the point of needing a conservator.\n\nIn the United States, in some states, corporations can be placed under conservatorship, as a less extreme alternative to receivership. Whereas a receiver is expected to terminate the rights of shareholders and managers, a conservator is expected merely to assume those rights, with the prospect that they will be relinquished.\nRobert Ramsey & John Head, law professors who specialize in financial issues, suggest that an insolvent bank should go into receivership rather than conservatorship to guard against false hope and moral hazard.\n\nAt the federal government level in the United States, in July 2008, the failing IndyMac Bank was taken into administrative receivership by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and its assets and secured liabilities transferred to a specially established bridge bank called IndyMac Federal Bank, FSB which was placed into conservatorship, also by the FDIC.\n\nAgain, in the U.S. at the federal level, in September 2008, the chief executive officers, and board of directors Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were dismissed, and the companies were placed into the conservatorship of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) via the determination of its director James B. Lockhart III, with the support and financial backing of U.S. Treasury via Treasury secretary Hank Paulson's commitment to keep the corporations solvent.\nThe intervention leading to the conservatorship of these two entities has become the largest in government history, and was justified as necessary step to prevent the damage to the financial system that would have been caused by their failure. Entities like this are considered too big to fail.\n\nAn even more ambitious use of the conservatorship model has been proposed by Duke professors Lawrence Baxter, Bill Brown and Jim Cox. They suggest that the troubled U.S. banks be placed in conservatorship, that some of their \"good assets\" be dropped into newly created \"good bank\" subsidiaries (presumably under new management), and the remaining \"bad assets\" be left to be managed under the supervision of a conservatorship structure.\n\n\n"}

It housed the former Supreme Court from 1912 to 1983 and the Legislative Council from 1985 to 2011. It is located at 8 Jackson Road, in Central, along the eastern side of Statue Square, directly west of Chater Garden. As the Old Supreme Court, its exterior is one of the declared monuments of Hong Kong.\n\nThe building was designed by Sir Aston Webb and Ingress Bell, the British architects responsible for the eastern façade of Buckingham Palace and the Cromwell Road frontage of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.\n\nConstruction of the Building started in 1900 and it was opened on 15 January 1912 by the Governor Sir Frederick Lugard. The two-storey granite building is neo-classical in style supported by Ionic columns. It is surmounted by a 2.7 m high blind-folded statue of Justice, represented by Themis, the Greek Goddess of Justice and Law. This statue is inspired by the one erected on the Old Bailey of London.\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong (December\n1941 to August 1945), the building was used as the headquarters of the \"Kempeitai\" (Military Police).\n\nIn 1978, this building was severely affected by the construction of MTR; therefore, it had to undergo some restoration afterwards. As a consequence, for a time in the early 1980s, the Supreme Court was moved to the Former French Mission Building, which was then used by the Victoria District Court.\n\nThe building became the Legislative Council Building in 1985, and the Supreme Court was moved to the Supreme Court Building in Admiralty and was renamed the High Court Building in 1997.\n\nIn 2011 the Legislative Council was moved to the Legislative Council Complex within the Central Government Complex at Tamar site.\n\nOn 7 September 2015, the building reverted to its former judicial function. It is now housing the Court of Final Appeal. The opening ceremony was held on 25 September 2015 by the Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal Geoffrey Ma Tao-li.\n\nThe building was erected on reclaimed land. Its foundation was formed by driving hundreds of Chinese fir tree trunks into the mixture of reclamation materials and silt on the site. As a consequence, the Building is in effect \"floating\" on a timber raft. Such a foundation system requires the groundwater level to be maintained at a constant level, and a groundwater replenishment system is installed to replace groundwater as required.\n\nThe plan of the building follows a rectangular pattern and is symmetrical. The Building occupies an area of around (about ) and is surrounded by columns. The height of the building, from street level to the highest point, which is in the form of a bronze Tudor Crown, is about .\nA pediment surmounts the central section of the building facing Statue Square. The pediment is topped by a Statue of Justice and under it is the inscription \"Erected AD MDCCCCX\" (Erected AD 1910). The pediment incorporates a semi-circular window and the carving of the British Royal Coat of Arms is above it. The shield shows the various royal emblems of the various parts of the United Kingdom: the three lions of England in the first and fourth quarters, the lion of Scotland in the second and the harp of Ireland in the third. The shield is supported by the English lion and Scottish unicorn and is surmounted by the royal crown. The motto of the sovereign, \"Dieu et mon droit\" (God and my right), is displayed underneath it. The figures of Mercy and Truth are located on both sides of the British Royal Arms.\n\n\n"}

He was one of the most famous artists in Europe in the late 19th century, and his paintings were collected by major museums. In later life, he combined a Divisionist painting style with Symbolist images of nature. He was active in Switzerland during the last period of his life.\n\nGiovanni Battista Emanuele Maria Segatini [\"sic\"] was born at Arco in Trentino, which was then part of the County of Tyrol in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He later changed his family name by adding another \"n\" after the \"a\". He was the second child of Agostino Segatini (1802–1866) and Margherita de Giradi (1828–1865). His older brother, Lodovico, died in a fire the year Giovanni was born. During the first seven years of his life, his father, who was a tradesman, traveled extensively while looking for work. Except for a six-month period in 1864 when Agostino returned to Trentino, Segantini spent his early years with his mother, who experienced severe depression due to the death of Lodovico. These years were marked by poverty, hunger and limited education due to his mother's inability to cope.\n\nIn the spring of 1865, his mother died after spending the past seven years in increasingly poor health. His father left Giovanni under the care of Irene, his second child from a previous marriage, and again traveled in search of work. He died a year later without returning home and leaving his family nothing. Without money from her father, Irene lived in extreme poverty. She was forced to spend most of her time working menial jobs while leaving Giovanni to subsist on his own.\n\nIrene hoped to improve her life by moving to Milan, and in late 1865 she submitted an application to relinquish Austrian citizenship for both her brother and her. She either misunderstood the process or simply did not have enough time to follow through, and although their Austrian citizenship was revoked she neglected to apply for Italian citizenship. As a result, both Segantini and his sister remained stateless for the rest of their lives. After he became famous Switzerland offered him citizenship on more than one occasion, but he refused in spite of many hardships, saying Italy was his true homeland. After his death the Swiss government successfully awarded him citizenship.\n\nAt age seven, Segantini ran away and was later found living on the streets of Milan. The police committed him to the Marchiondi Reformatory, where he learned basic cobbling skills but little else. For much of his early life, he could barely read or write; he finally learned both skills when he was in his mid-30s. Fortunately, a chaplain at the reformatory noticed that he could draw quite well, and he encouraged this talent in an attempt to lift his self-esteem.\n\nIn 1873, Segantini's half-brother Napoleon claimed him from the reformatory, and for the next year Segantini lived with Napoleon in Trentino. Napoleon ran a photography studio, and Segantini learned the basics of this relatively new art form while working there with his half-brother. He would later use photography to record scenes that he incorporated into his painting.\n\nThe following year, Segantini returned to Milan and attended classes at the Brera Academy. While there, he became friends with members from a transformative movement known as Scapigliatura (the \"Disheveleds\"), which included artists, poets, writers and musicians who sought to erase the differences between art and life. Among his closest friends at the time were Carlo Bugatti and Emilio Longoni, both of whom profoundly influenced his work and his interests.\n\nHis first major painting, \"The Chancel of Sant Antonio\" (Il Coro di Sant'Antonio), was noticed for its powerful quality, and in 1879 it was acquired by Milan's Società per le Belle Arti. That work attracted the attention of painter and gallery owner Vittore Grubicy de Dragon, who became his advisor, dealer and his life-long financial supporter. Grubicy and his brother, Alberto, who was a co-owner of the gallery, introduced Segantini to the works of Anton Mauve and Jean-François Millet. Both of these artists influenced Segantini's work for many years.\n\nThat same year, he met Bugatti's sister, Luigia Pierina Bugatti (1862–1938), known as \"Bice\", and they began a life-long romance. Although Segantini tried to marry Bice the next year, due to his stateless status he could not be granted the proper legal papers. In opposition to this bureaucratic technicality, they decided to live together as an unmarried couple. This arrangement led to frequent conflicts with the Catholic church that dominated the region at this time, and they were forced to relocate every few years to avoid local condemnation.\n\nIn spite of these difficulties, Segantini was thoroughly devoted to Bice throughout his life. He wrote many love letters when he was away from her, sometimes including wild flowers that he had picked. Once he wrote, \"Take these unsightly flowers, these violets, as a symbol of my great love, When a spring comes in which I fail to send you such violets, you will no longer find me among the living.\"\n\nIn 1880, he and Bice moved to Pusiano and soon thereafter to the village of Carella, where they shared a house with their friend Longoni. It was in this mountain scenery that Segantini began to paint en plein air, preferring to work in the outdoors than in a studio. While he worked outside, Bice would read to him, and eventually he learned to read and write. Later he would write articles for Italian art magazines, and he was a prolific letter writer to Bice when he traveled and to other artists throughout Europe.\n\nAt this time, he painted the first version of \"Ave Maria\" (Segantini Museum, St. Moritz), which took a gold medal at the 1883 World's Fair in Amsterdam. As his fame rose, Segantini entered into a formal agreement with the Grubicys to be the sole representatives of his work. While this allowed Segantini more freedom to pursue his artistry, the dealers were consistently slow in fulfilling their financial obligations to the artists. The family struggled for many years in relative poverty, even as Bice gave birth to four children: Gottardo (1882–1974 ), Alberto (1883–1904), Mario (1885–1916) and Bianca (1886–1980). To help Bice care for his family, Segantini employed a young maid, Barbara \"Baba\" Uffer, who also became his favorite model for his paintings. Baba stayed with the family throughout their periods of penury and many households, but unlike many artist/model relationships of the time there is no evidence that they had any romantic involvement.\n\nDuring this period Segantini produced several important paintings using Baba as a model, including \"Mothers\", \"After a Storm in the Alps\", \"A Kiss\" and \"Moonlight Effect\" (Musée des Beaux-Arts, Rouen).\n\nIn 1886, Segantini sought a less expensive place to live and, attracted by the beautiful mountain scenery, he moved his family to Savognin, Graubünden. From November, 1886, to March, 1887, Grubicy stayed with the Segantinis in their new home. Excited by the recent work of Mauve and others, Grubicy suggested that Segantini further separate his colors in order to increase their brilliance. The artist applied this advice to a second version of \"Ave Maria\", in which he used the Divisionist painting technique for the first time. His bolder style was immediately acclaimed by audiences; Segantini received gold medals in Munich (for \"Midday in the Alps\") and Turin (for \"Ploughing\"). The following year the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool purchased his major painting, \"The Punishment of Lust\".\nIt is thought that Grubicy introduced the concept of Symbolism to Segantini during his recent visit. Because of his connections with artists in France, Grubicy would have known about the recently published Symbolist Manifesto by Jean Moréas. This essay is credited with introducing visual artists to the then nascent literary movement led by Charles Baudelaire, Stéphane Mallarmé, and Paul Valéry.\n\nAt the 1890 Salon des XX in Brussels, Segantini was given an entire exhibition room, an honor awarded such greats as Cézanne, Gauguin and Van Gogh. While his fame had increased throughout Europe, he was never able to attend international shows because he could not obtain a passport due to his stateless status. Frustrated that the government would not grant him citizenship papers in spite of his fame, Segantini refused to pay cantonal taxes in Savognin. After creditors pursued him he moved his family to the Engadin valley (altitude 5,954 feet/1,815 meters) in another part of Switzerland. There the high mountain passes and clear light become his chief subject matter for the next five years.\n\nAfter he moved higher into the mountains he began to study philosophy, concentrating on those writers who questioned the meaning of life and one's place in the natural world. He studied Maeterlinck, D'Annunzio and Goethe and especially Nietzsche, becoming so fascinated with the latter that he drew an illustration for the first Italian translation of Thus Spoke Zarathustra.\n\nSoon after arriving he made the acquaintance of Giovanni Giacometti, father of Alberto Giacometti, and an artist in his own right. Giacometti would later paint a portrait of Segantini on his death bed and complete some of Segantini's unfinished works posthumously. Segantini also met and corresponded at length with Giuseppe Pellizza da Volpedo, an Italian Neo-Impressionist whose color techniques he admired.\nSegantini continued to gain recognition in Italy, and in 1894 the Castello Sforzesco in Milan put on a retrospective of ninety of his works. At the first Venice Biennale in 1895, Segantini was awarded the Prize of the Italian State for his painting \"Return to the Homeland\". He continued to gain fame when a whole room was devoted to his work in the Munich Secession in 1896. After seeing his painting \"The Sad Hour\" in Munich, the director of the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin purchased the work for that museum. That same year his painting \"Ploughing\" is bought by the Neue Pinakothek in Munich.\n\nIn 1897, Segantini was commissioned by a group of local hotels to build a huge panorama of the Engadin valley to be shown in a specially built round hall at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris. For this project he worked almost exclusively outdoors on large canvases covered by substantial wooden shelters. Before it was completed, however, the project had to be scaled down for financial reasons. Segantini redesigned the concept into a large triptych known as \"Life\", \"Nature\" and \"Death\" (Segantini Museum, St. Moritz), which is now his most famous work. He continued to work on it until his death.\n\nSegantini's importance as an international artist was further established that same year, when the Austrian state financed a luxury monograph on his work. Museums throughout Europe vied to buy his paintings, including \"The Comfort of Faith\", purchased by the Hamburger Kunsthalle and \"The Bad Mothers\" (Österreichische Galerie Belvedere, Vienna), bought by the Vienna Secession. In 1899 an entire room is devoted to Segantini's work at the annual exhibition of the Societe des Beaux-Arts in Brussels.\n\nEager to finish the third part of his large tryptich, \"Nature\" (Segantini Museum, St. Moritz) Segantini returned to the high altitude of the mountains near Schafberg. The pace of his work, coupled with the high altitude, affected his health, and in mid-September he became ill with acute peritonitis. Two weeks later he died. His son Mario and his partner Bice were with him at his death bed.\n\nAt the end of November, a memorial exhibition of his works was put on display in Milan. Two years later the largest Segantini retrospective to date took place in Vienna. In 1908, the Segantini Museum was established in St. Moritz, its design inspired by one of the sketches for the pavilions for the Engadine Panorama.\n\nMore than anything else, Segantini's work represents the quintessential transition from traditional nineteenth-century art to the changing styles and interests of the twentieth century. He began with simple scenes of common people living off of the earth— peasants, farmers, shepherds—and moved toward a thematic symbolist style that continued to embody the landscapes around him while intertwining pantheistic images representing \"a primeval Arcadia\". Over the course of his life, he moved from both the physical and emotional internal, such as his scene of motherhood in a stable, to the grand external views of the mountain scenery where he chose to live.\n\nNature and the connections of people to nature are the core themes of his art. After he moved to the mountains he wrote \"I am now working passionately in order to wrest the secret of Nature's spirit from her. Nature utters the eternal word to the artist: love, love; and the earth sings life in spring, and the soul of things reawakens.\"\n\nHis 1896 painting \"Love at the Springs of Life\" (Galleria Civica d'Arte Moderna, Milan) reflects Segantini's philosophical approach to his art. Set in the high mountain landscape near his home, it pictures an angel with large wings spread over a small waterfall flowing from some rocks. In the distance two lovers, clothed in white flowing robes, walk along a path coming toward the spring. Around them are flowers that would have been seen by viewers at the time as symbols of love and life.\n\nArt historian Robert Rosenblum described Segantini as transforming \"the earthbound into the spiritual\", and the artist himself referred to his work as \"naturalist Symbolism\". He said \"I've got God inside me. I don't need to go to church.\"\n\nA signposted multiday trekking route passes areas that were common to the painter for his \"En plein air\" painting.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "44603375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44603375", "title": "Legal socialization", "text": "Legal socialization\n\nLegal socialization is the process through which, individuals acquire attitudes and beliefs about the law, legal authorities, and legal institutions. This occurs through individuals' interactions, both personal and vicarious, with police, courts, and other legal actors. To date, most of what is known about legal socialization comes from studies of individual differences among adults in their perceived legitimacy of law and legal institutions, and in their cynicism about the law and its underlying norms. adults' attitudes about the legitimacy of law are directly tied to individuals' compliance with the law and cooperation with legal authorities.\n\nAccording to June L. Tapp,\nLegal socialization consists of an individual's attitudes toward the legal system (referred to as legitimacy), the law (legal cynicism), and moral codes that guide behaviour (moral disengagement)\n\nJudith Torney includes, recognition of law, understanding function of the law, accurately recognising source of law, developing relevant attitudes towards those who enforce the law, bringing personal behaviour into line with morality and legality.\n\nInternalisation (or internalization) in sociology and other social sciences is the process of acceptance of a set of norms and values established by people or groups which are influential to the individual through the process of socialisation. \nJohn Finley Scott described internalisation as a metaphor in which something (i.e. an idea, concept, action) moves from outside the mind or personality to a place inside of it. The structure and the happenings of society shapes one's inner self and it can also be reversed.\n\nThe process of internalisation starts with learning what the norms are, and then the individual goes through a process of understanding why they are of value or why they make sense, until finally they accept the norm as their own viewpoint. Internalised norms are said to be part of an individual's personality and may be exhibited by one's moral actions. However, there can also be a distinction between internal commitment to a norm and what one exhibits externally.\n\nThrough internalisation individuals accept a set of norms and values that are established by other individuals, groups, or society as a whole.\n\nNorm acceptance, norm confirmity and norm compliance can be achieved by coercion, acultuaration, or persuasion. But the commitment to the law can be better achieved by process of internalisation and legitimacy of law helpful in this process.\n\nAccording to Marju Luts reception is chiefly defined as the transfer of a legal phenomenon of a different legal culture, other area or other period of time to a new legal climate. Awareness of the recipient that its activity is truly the adoption of an element of law that is, in a legal-cultural context, hitherto alien (or already forgotten). The matter is further specified on the basis of whether such awareness is characteristic of the whole recipient society or only the initiators of reception. awareness, Voluntariness\n\nThe Author(s): Chantal Kourilsky-Augeven believe pre-eminence previously given to the transmission processes of values, norms and behavioural models should be renounced in favour of a definition of legal socialisation during childhood and adolescence, from the perspective of the subject playing an active part; Law must be considered as a fundamental part of the culture the subject belongs to; The subject acquires the common knowledge of the dominant legal culture in his society by \"legal acculturation of the subject\" ; In parallel occurs the \"acculturation by the subject\" concerning different objects of the common legal culture. The \"legal acculturation of the subject\" would thus occur thanks to the transmission by school (or other channels conveying of the common culture), integrating the historical experience assimilated by national culture and fundamental concepts and values of the national legal heritage (in particular regarding the state, the citizen, law or justice) while the subject would himself proceed to the \"acculturation of these concepts\" in light of the codes of interpretation of reality acquired within his close environment in order to integrate them within his own system of representations.\n\nJudith Torney describes three processes of legal socialisation namely, \"accumulation process\", \"identification process\" and \"role transfer process\". In accumulation process, law is learned from range of various sources. In \"the identification process\", attitudes and values of significant adults are absorbed in a natural psychological process wherein a tendency to adopt beliefs with whom one identifies and is socially bonded makes the impact. Whereas in \"the role transfer process\" from immediate surroundings like home or school one accepts rule making and implementing authority of the seniors and imputes the same and provides legitimacy to law making and/or enforcing agencies like police. \n\nWhere there is an apparent need for a change of legal system in one culture and another existing culture provides an opportunity to satisfy the need\n\nVeneration reception is one example which occurs if alien norms, institutes or a whole system is adopted for their venerated position and prestige of cultural background.\n\nIf a legal phenomenon is imposed upon another nation by force on another nation is referred to as imposed legal reception, in few instances under certain conditions imposed reception may transform into a voluntary process and thus become genuine reception but usually imposed legal phenomenon would not be considered genuine legal reception .\n\nis a process whereby a legal phenomenon transfers to another geographic area or culture together with people. A situation where a norm of another legal culture is established in a different legal climate by enacting legislation regardless of its original implementation background may also be interpreted as a mere transplantation of a legal phenomenon. Transplantation also occurs where a legal theory is taken to another geographical area. As in the case of imposed reception or voluntary reception, an original transplantation may become true reception: of course not among the group or nation which is the carrier of transplantation but among the legal culture surrounding it in the new area. The transformation of transplantation into reception is perhaps of greater significance in the history of legal science than it is in positive law.\n\nin which the spread of legal doctrines and theories plays an especially important role. It is quite clear that the spread of methods brings about the spread of their conceptual and systematic basis. In this regard, system not only refers to a certain classification of legal material, but an internally consistent and systematic approach to law.\n\n\"Explicit legal socialisation\", which covers socially obvious\naspects of law, consciously identified with what he calls law, should be distinguished from \"implicit legal socialisation\" which regulates every day situations that the subject does not associate with law, due to their familiarity in every day life.\n\n\"Implicit\" or \"subconscious\" legal socialisation – whereby the subject does not realise it is a matter of law, but thinks it is only ordinary practice – seems as effective as the first type of socialisation.\n\nProcedural justice (the perceived fairness of legal system i.e. the police, judge, and defense attorney) is related to the overall measure of legal socialization and each of its individual components wise legitimacy, legal cynicism, and moral disengagement\n\nAccording to Chantal Kourilsky - Augeven, phenomena of individuals' socialisation have been developed in three disciplines: psychology, anthropology and sociology. Psychologists, who study at the level of the individual, emphasize the construction of the personality or identity of the subject. Anthropologists start with a specific culture, considered as an entity formed by a group of people who share \"ways of thinking, feeling and acting\", values and behavioural norms. These common values and norms are then internalised by new generations and ensure the cohesion and continuance of the community. Like anthropologists, sociologists view the object of study from the perspective of society as a whole, but perceive socialisation more strongly in terms of the transmission of behavioural norms and models by persons and institutions. They tend to assign to them, for functional purposes, the role of socialisation agents. Socialisation of subjects is also considered in terms of learning of social roles or attainment of social skills.<ref name=\"http://www.ejls.eu/1/13.htm#_ftn1\">http://www.ejls.eu/1/13.htm#_ftn1</ref>\n\nThese three approaches tend to combine into two schools of thought. The first gives pre-eminence to the subject's viewpoint, but can only consider its development in relation to the interactions with the culture and society in which he is immersed. The second gives pre-eminence to society or culture as a whole, but can only apprehend subjects' modalities of adaptation or participation in this society by looking at modalities of individual development.\n\nWhen experiences with legal actors are perceived as fair, just and proportionate, these experiences reinforce the legitimacy of the\nlaw, and can contribute to compliance and desistance. However, when punishment is delivered unfairly, unjustly and/or disproportionately, it leads to cynicism about the law, and can contribute to anger and persistence (Sampson and Bartusch, 1998; Kirk and Papachristos, 2011; Papachristos,Meares and Fagan, 2012). It is easier in a democratic and pluralist society to exercise authority through legitimacy, i.e. Acting in ways that people find appropriate, reasonable and just.\n\nAccording to Tom R. Tyler, People obey the law if they believe it's legitimate, not because they fear punishment—this is the startling conclusion of Tom Tyler's classic study. Tyler suggests that lawmakers and law enforcers would do much better to make legal systems worthy of respect than to try to instill fear of punishment. He finds that people obey law primarily because they believe in respecting legitimate authority. Brute coercive power may achieve obedience but will not sustain it. Only a sense of fairness, trust and legitimacy can do that by nurturing feelings of obligation. When outcomes are fair, and the procedures that lead to those outcomes transparent and just, people will follow rules, cooperate with police, pay fines, and accept punishment. Procedural justice - the experience directly or vicariously of transparency, fairness, neutrality and respect in dealings with criminal justice - is vital for any rule-following behaviour.\n\nIn order to better understand representations and behaviours of adults in\nrelation to law and rights, their origin in childhood and adolescence are of relevance. Legal socialization is shaped during adolescence and that these attitudes are influenced by perceptions of fairness of interactions with authority figures and are important because they are related to delinquent behavior. (Fagan & Tyler, 2005). School specific (un-)fairness experiences can affect legal socialisation of students.\n\nYouth who perceive their experiences procedural justice being less fair have more negative attitudes about the law, legal system, and moral rules and codes. Youth with more negative views of the legal system and moral codes participate in more delinquent behavior. Legitimacy and moral disengagement components and overall measure of legal socialization are related to higher levels of delinquent behavior.\n\n"}

{"id": "483897", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=483897", "title": "Li Si", "text": "Li Si\n\nLi Si (; 280 BCSeptember or October 208 BC) was a Chinese politician of the Qin dynasty, well known Legalist writer and politician, and notable calligrapher. He served as Chancellor (or Prime Minister) from 246–208 BC under two rulers: Qin Shi Huang, the king of the Qin state and later the First Emperor of the Qin dynasty; and Qin Er Shi, Qin Shi Huang's eighteenth son and the Second Emperor. Concerning administrative methods, Li Si \"indicated that he admired and utilized the ideas of Shen Buhai\", repeatedly referring to the technique of Shen Buhai and Han Fei, but regarding law followed Shang Yang.\n\nStanford University's John Knoblock considered Li Si \"one of the two or three most important figures in Chinese history\". Having a clear vision of universal empire and \"one world comprising all Chinese, bringing with universal dominion universal peace\", Li Si was \"largely responsible for the creation of those institutions that made the Qin dynasty the first universal state in Chinese history\".\n\nLi Si assisted the Emperor Shi Huangdi in unifying the laws, governmental ordinances, weights and measures, and standardized chariots, carts, and the characters used in writing... [facilitating] the cultural unification of China. He \"created a government based solely on merit, so that in the empire sons and younger brothers in the imperial clan were not ennobled, but meritorious ministers were\", and \"pacified the frontier regions by subduing the barbarians to the north and south\". He had the weapons of the feudal states melted and cast into musical bells and large human statues, and relaxed taxes and the draconian punishments inherited from Shang Yang.\n\nLi Si was originally from Shang Cai (上蔡) in the State of Chu. As a young man he was a minor functionary in the local administration of Chu. According to the \"Records of the Great Historian\", one day Li Si observed that rats in the outhouse were dirty and hungry but the rats in the barn house were well fed. He suddenly realized that \"there is no set standard for honour since everyone's life is different. The values of people are determined by their social status. And like rats, people's social status often depends purely on the random life events around them. And so instead of always being restricted by moral codes, people should do what they deemed best at the moment.\" He made up his mind to take up politics as a career, which was a common choice for scholars not from a noble family during the Warring States period.\n\nLi Si was unable to advance his career in Chu. He believed that achieving nothing in life while being so intelligent and educated would bring shame to not just himself but to all scholars. After having finished his education with the famous Confucian thinker Xunzi, he moved to the State of Qin, the most powerful state at that time in an attempt to advance his political career.\n\nDuring his stay in Qin, Li Si became a guest of Prime Minister Lü Buwei and got the chance to talk to the ruler of Ying Zheng who would later become the first emperor of a unified China, Qin Shi Huang. Li Si expressed that the Qin state was extremely powerful, but uniting China was still impossible if all of the other six states united to fight against Qin. Qin Shi Huang was impressed by Li Si's view of how to unify China. Having adopted Li Si's proposal, the ruler of Qin spent generously to lure intellectuals to the state of Qin and sent out assassins to kill important scholars in other states.\n\nIn 237 BC a clique at the Qin court urged King Zheng to expel all foreigners from the state to prevent espionage. As a native of Chu, Li Si would be a target of the policy so he memorialised the king explaining the many benefits of foreigners to Qin including \"the sultry girls of Zhao\". The king relented and, impressed with Li Si's rhetoric, promoted him. The same year, Li Si is reported to have urged King Zheng to annex the neighbouring State of Han to order to intimidate the other five remaining states. Li Si also wrote the \"Petition against the Expulsion of Guest Officers” (Jianzhuke Shu) in 234 BC. Han Fei, a member of the aristocracy from the State of Han, was asked by the Han king to go to Qin and resolve the situation through diplomacy. Li Si, who envied Han Fei's intellect, persuaded the Qin king that he could neither send Han Fei back (as his superior ability would be a threat to Qin) nor employ him (as his loyalty would not be to Qin). As a result, Han Fei was imprisoned, and in 233 BC convinced by Li Si to commit suicide by taking poison. The State of Han was later conquered in 230 BC.\n\nAfter Qin Shi Huang became emperor Li Si persuaded him to suppress intellectual dissent. Li Si believed that books regarding things such as medicine, agriculture and prophecy could be ignored but political books were dangerous in public hands. It was hard to make progress and change the country with the opposition of so many \"free thinking\" scholars. As a result, only the state should keep political books, and only the state run schools should be allowed to educate political scholars. Li Si himself penned the edict ordering the destruction of historical records and literature in 213 BC, including key Confucian texts, which he thought detrimental to the welfare of the state. It is commonly thought that 460 Confucian scholars were buried alive, from the well-known historical event \"Burning Books and Burying Confucianists\" (焚书坑儒); however, this was a mistranslation in later historical texts. In reality, the 460 people who were buried alive by the Qin emperor, Shi Huang Di, were mainly priests and shamans who were alleged to be depriving the emperor of resources and wealth while looking for medicines that would grant eternal life or apotheosis.\n\nWhen Qin Shi Huang died while away from the capital, Li Si and the chief eunuch Zhao Gao suppressed the late emperor's choice of successor, which was Fusu. At that time Fusu was close friends with Meng Tian. If Fusu became the next emperor there was a high chance Meng Tian would replace Li Si as prime minister. Fearing a loss of power, Li Si decided to betray the dead Qin Shi Huang. Li Si and Zhao Gao tricked Fusu into committing suicide, and installed another prince, Qin Er Shi (229 BC – 207 BC) in his place. During the tumultuous aftermath, Zhao Gao convinced the new emperor to install his followers in official positions. When his power base was secure enough, Zhao Gao betrayed Li Si and charged him with treason. Qin Er Shi, who viewed Zhao Gao as his teacher, did not question his decision. Zhao Gao had Li Si tortured until he admitted the crime. In 208 BC, Zhao Gao had Li Si executed via waist chop (腰斩), Li's own invention. He also had Li Si's entire family exterminated.\n\nBelieving in a highly bureaucratic system, Li Si is considered to have been central to the efficiency of the state of Qin and the success of its military conquest. He was also instrumental in systematizing standard measures and currency in post-unified China. He further helped systematize the written Chinese language by promulgating as the imperial standard the small seal script which had already been in use in the state of Qin. In this process, variant glyphs within the Qin script were proscribed, as were variant scripts from the different regions which had been conquered. This would have a unifying effect on the Chinese culture for thousands of years. Li Si was also the author of the \"Cangjiepian\", the first Chinese language primer of which fragments still exist.\n\n\n\n"}

The case is often still referred to by way of illustration to the parochial and slightly paternalistic view previously taken by the English courts in relation to matters of jurisdiction, and in particular the comments of Lord Denning MR and Edmund Davies LJ.\n\nHowever the principle established by the case that presence within the jurisdiction is not negated only because it is a short or transient presence remains good law.\n\nThe Maharanee of Baroda and Mr Wildenstein both lived in France, although in the judgment they were both described as being \"citizens of the world\". Mr Wildenstein was an art dealer of international repute. In 1965 the Maharanee purchased a painting from Mr Wildenstein in Paris which was believed to be \"La Poésie\" by François Boucher for the equivalent of approximately £33,000.\n\nIn 1968 the painting was reviewed by Mr Francis Watson, who was the Surveyor of Her Majesty’s works of Art. He expressed the view that it was not a Boucher. The Maharanee sent the painting to Christie's for a formal valuation. They expressed the view that the painting \"cannot be regarded as an autograph work by François Boucher, but would appear to be a work from his immediate circle of followers. We think that it might make about £750 at auction...\".\n\nThe Maharanee instructed her solicitors to issue a writ against Mr Wildenstein claiming that painting was not a Boucher and seeking rescission and repayment of the purchase price. The writ was issued on 3 September 1969. However it was not served on Mr Wildenstein until 20 June 1970 when he was in the United Kingdom visiting the Ascot races.\n\nMr Wildenstein objected to the court taking jurisdiction, and successfully applied for the writ to be set aside. The Maharanee appealed against that decision to the Court of Appeal.\n\nThe lead judgment was given by Lord Denning MR. He held that the writ had been properly served on the defendant in England, and if a defendant is properly served with a writ while he is in this country, albeit on a short visit, the plaintiff was entitled to continue the proceedings to the end. The plaintiff had validly invoked the jurisdiction of the Queen’s courts; and was entitled to require those courts to proceed to adjudicate upon the claim. The courts should not strike the claim out unless it was vexatious or oppressive, or otherwise an abuse of the process of the court. If the statement of claim discloses a reasonable cause of action, the plaintiff is entitled to pursue it in the English courts, even though the cause of action did arise in a foreign country. It should not be stayed unless it would plainly be unjust to the defendant to require him to defend it in England, and that injustice must be so great as to outweigh the right of the plaintiff to continue the claim here. He held that the burden of proof was on Mr Wildenstein to show that it would be an injustice to him to have the case tried in England, and that he had not discharged that burden.\n\nEdmund Davies and Stephenson LJJ gave concurring judgments.\n\nThe case was notable for a number of comments made during the course of judgment about the superior nature of the English courts to the French ones, and rebuffing the notion that it would be inappropriate for the English courts to hear cases that were otherwise unconnected with England.\n\nIn relation to the suggestion that the case should properly be tried in France, Lord Denning MR stated:\nLord Denning would echo these comments a year later in \"The Atlantic Star\", where he would say:\n\nEdmund Davies LJ also stated:\n\nThe case is no longer considered good law with respect to taking jurisdiction, and in modern times the decision would likely have been reversed, with a stay being granted on the basis of \"forum non conveniens\". However the part of the decision that states that any transitory presence within the jurisdiction is still sufficient for the service of a writ remains good law.\n\nThe position of jurisdiction between the English and French courts is also now regulated by the Brussels Regime.\n"}

The Married Women's Property Acts helped to rectify some of the difficulties that women faced under coverture, the British common law system that subsumed married women's ability to own property, wages, enter in to contracts, and otherwise act autonomously to their husband's authority. After New York passed their Married Women's Property Law in 1848, this law became the template for other states to grant married women the right to own property. \n\nUnder the common law legal doctrine known as coverture, a married woman in Great Britain's North American colonies and later in the United States had hardly any legal existence apart from her husband. Her rights and obligations were subsumed under his. She could not own property, enter into contracts, or earn a salary. Over several decades, beginning in 1839, statutes that enabled women to control real and personal property, participate in contracts and lawsuits, inherit independently of their husbands, work for a salary, and write wills were enacted. Usually, concerns for family integrity and protecting a household from economic crisis, rather than a liberal conception of the role of women in society, motivated these changes. Change came in piecemeal fashion. As late as 1867 a decision of the Supreme Court of Illinois in \"Cole v. Van Riper\" noted that \"It is simply impossible that a married woman should be able to control and enjoy her property as if she were sole, without practically leaving her at liberty to annul the marriage.\" According to one analysis, the legislation came in three phases—allowing married women to own property, then to keep their own income, then to engage in business—and advanced more quickly in the West, exactly like female suffrage did.\n\nConnecticut's law of 1809 allowing a married woman to write a will was a forerunner, though its impact on property and contracts was so slight that it is not counted as the first statute to address married women's property rights.\n\nBeginning in the nineteenth century, women in the Northern states were the principal advocates of enhancing women's property rights, but the first legislation embodying some of the changes they advocated was enacted in the American South. The Panic of 1837 inspired attempts to limit the impact of such an economic crisis by protecting family assets. Mississippi initiated the trend in 1839 with its Married Women's Property Act that allowed married women to own property. Any attempt to collect debt from her husband could not reach property only she owned. She had the right to refuse to sell the property, but could not manage that property or sell it without her husband's consent. Parents who gave property to a daughter upon marriage also enjoyed the protection the Act provided from a son-in-law's mishandling of his family's affairs. The property a woman could own and protect from her husband's creditors included slaves.\n\nSeveral Southern states adopted similar legislation, beginning with Maryland in 1843 and Arkansas in 1846. Northern states that acted included Michigan in 1844, which covered both real and personal property obtained by a woman before or during her marriage. More limited statutes were passed during the next two years in Ohio, Indiana, and Iowa.\n\nTexas, still an independent republic rather than a state, passed its act in 1840. It was the most expansive legislation of any enacted in the South and allowed a married woman to enter into certain contracts, write a will, and sue for divorce. Not only could she veto the sale of her property, but she could veto the sale of the family homestead even if she was not its owner. Without referencing the independence of the wife that advocates for such legislation envisioned, legislators argued that the legislation protected the wife and children from irresponsible husbands.\n\nThe original state constitutions of Kansas (1859), Nevada (1864), and Oregon (1857) guaranteed the right of women to own property without respect to marital status.\n\nIn 1845, New York granted a married woman who secured \"a patent for her own invention\" the right to hold it and retain all earnings from it \"as if unmarried\". The Married Women's Property Act was enacted on April 7, 1848, as part of a more general movement, underway since the 1820s, away from common law traditions in favor of the codification of law. Ernestine Rose had been campaigning for such a statute since 1836, later joined by Paulina Wright Davis and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. It significantly altered the law regarding the property rights granted to married women, allowing them to own and control their own property. It was used as a model by several other states in the 1850s. It provided that:\n\n\nPennsylvania followed with similar legislation a few weeks later. In July, the Seneca Falls Convention, the first women's rights convention, approved a \"Declaration of Sentiments\" authored by Elizabeth Cady Stanton that listed among the \"injuries and usurpations on the part of man toward woman\":\n<poem>\nHe has made her, if married, in the eye of the law, civilly dead.\nHe has taken from her all right in property, even to the wages she earns.\nHe has so framed the laws of divorce, as to what shall be the proper causes of divorce, in case of separation, to whom the guardianship of the children shall be given; as to be wholly regardless of the happiness of the women—the law, in all cases, going upon a false supposition of the supremacy of a man, and giving all power into his hands.\n</poem>\n\nMassachusetts passed its Married Women's Property Act on May 5, 1855. It allowed married women to own and sell real and personal property, control their earnings, to sue and to make wills. Other legislation enacted that year made divorce and remarriage easier, provided protections for divorced women, and removed the five-year waiting period before a wife could file for divorce on the grounds of desertion.\n\nNew Jersey passed a limited statute in 1852 and in 1874 another version that one historian described as \"comprehensive and progressive\".\n\nIn an exception to the statutory expansion of the legal rights of married women, the California Constitution of 1849, drawing on the community property tradition of Spanish civil law rather than the common law tradition, distinguished a wife's property from community property: \"All property, both real and personal, of the wife, owned or claimed by her before marriage, and that acquired afterward by gift, devise, or descent, shall be her separate property; and laws shall be passed more clearly defining the rights of the wife in relation as well to her separate property, as to that held in common with her husband.\"\n\nThe movement to expand the property rights of married women did not go unchallenged. Virginia debated and rejected such legislation in the 1840s. In 1849, the Tennessee legislature stated, in one historian's account, \"that married women lack independent souls and thus should not be allowed to own property.\" New York expanded its statute in 1860, with the Married Women's Earnings Act. It then repealed parts of its legislation in 1862, eliminating a married woman's right to guardianship of her children and the right of a widow to manage her late husband's estate.\n\nAs of 1860, 14 states had passed some version of this statute. By the end of the Civil War, 29 states had passed some version of a Married Women's Property Act.\n\nAs the U.S. Congress considered legislation to protect the civil rights of African-Americans that became the Civil Rights Act of 1866, opponents of the legislation charged that it would alter the legal status of married women. Senator Edgar Cowan, a supporter of the legislature ridiculed that suggestion: \"What was the involuntary servitude mentioned there? ... Was it the right the husband had to the service of his wife? Nobody can pretend that those things were within the purview of that amendment; nobody believes it.\"\n\nIn the years following the Civil War, Harriet Beecher Stowe campaigned for the expansion of married women's rights, arguing in 1869 that:\n\nThe changing statutes and differences among the states complicated the situation of female authors. A married woman's right to contract with a publisher and to control what her writings earned depended on the state or states where she and her husband lived at the time. As of 1887, one-third of the states had not provided statutory protection for a married women to control her earnings. Three states gave married women no legal status until late in the nineteenth century: Delaware, South Carolina, and Virginia. Even where statutes appeared to establish some measure of rights for a married women, courts interpreted statutes to her disadvantage and relied on common law whenever a statute was less than explicit.\n\n"}

However, the regulation's text has been criticized as offering loopholes that can undermine the regulation's effectiveness. Some EU member countries, such as Slovenia and the Netherlands, have stronger net neutrality laws. \n\nThe 2002 regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services in the European Union consisted of five directives, which are referred to as \"the Framework Directive and the Specific Directives\":\n\nWhen the European Commission consulted on the updating of the Framework Directive and the Specific Directives in November 2007, it examined the possible need for legislation to mandate network neutrality, countering the potential damage, if any, caused by non-neutral broadband access. The European Commission stated that prioritisation \"is generally considered to be beneficial for the market so long as users have choice to access the transmission capabilities and the services they want\" and \"consequently, the current EU rules allow operators to offer different services to different customers groups, but not allow those who are in a dominant position to discriminate in an anti-competitive manner between customers in similar circumstances\". \n\nHowever, the European Commission highlighted that Europe's current legal framework cannot effectively prevent network operators from degrading their customers' services. Therefore, the European Commission proposed that it should be empowered to impose a minimum quality of services requirements. In addition, an obligation of transparency was proposed to limit network operators' ability to set up restrictions on end-users' choice of lawful content and applications.\n\nOn 19 December 2009, the so-called \"Telecoms Package\" came into force and EU member states were required to implement the Directive by May 2011. According to the European Commission the new transparency requirements in the Telecoms Package would mean that \"consumers will be informed—even before signing a contract—about the nature of the service to which they are subscribing, including traffic management techniques and their impact on service quality, as well as any other limitations (such as bandwidth caps or available connection speed)\". Regulation (EC) No 1211/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 established the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) and the Office Body of European Regulators of Electronic Communications. BEREC's main purpose is to promote cooperation between national regulatory authorities, ensuring a consistent application of the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications.\n\nThe European Parliament voted the EU Commission's September 2013 proposal on its first reading in April 2014 and the Council adopted a mandate to negotiate in March 2015. Following the adoption of the Digital Single Market Strategy by the Commission on 6 May, Heads of State and Government agreed on the need to strengthen the EU telecoms single market. After 18 months of negotiations, the European Parliament, Council and Commission reached two agreements on the end to roaming charges and on the first EU-wide rules on net neutrality on 30 June 2015, to be completed by an overhaul of EU telecoms rules in 2016. Specifically, article 3 of EU Regulation 2015/2120 sets the basic framework for ensuring net neutrality across the entire European Union. However, the regulation's text has been criticized as offering loopholes that can undermine the regulation's effectiveness.\n\nThe EU has laid down a framework on net neutrality, but some of EU states have stronger laws nationally, or are discussing passing them. However Neelie Kroes, former European Commissioner for Digital Agenda, has asked \"national legislators and regulators to wait for better evidence before regulating on an uncoordinated, country-by-country basis that slows down the creation of a Digital Single Market\".\n\nIn 2007, Plusnet was using deep packet inspection to implement limits and differential charges for peer-to-peer, file transfer protocol, and online game traffic. However, their network management philosophy was made clear for each package they sold, and was consistent between different websites.\n\nIn 2017, Germany mobile device ISP's like Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone were offering services that seemed to affect net neutrality. The government agency overseeing the market (Bundesnetzagentur) stated, in general these plans are in alignment with net neutrality but forced the companies to adopt some changes. \n\nEuropean net neutrality law has been criticised for leaving too many loopholes to be exploited, as amendments to close them failed to gain enough support across the European Parliament. Some loopholes include the ability to offer priority to \"specialised services\", provided they still treat the \"open\" internet equally. Such services included remote surgery, driverless cars and anti-terrorism efforts. The law does say that these services cannot be offered if they restrict bandwidth for normal users. Another exemption is giving websites a \"Zero-rating\", not counting a website against a user's data limits, giving an advantage to those sites when being viewed via a metered connection.\n\n\n"}

The ensuing FBI investigation found that an employee, Aaron McGrath, was operating two child pornography sites at his work and one at his home. After a year of surveillance, the FBI arrested McGrath and took control of his three sites (PedoBoard, PedoBook, TB2) for a two-week period starting in November 2012. During this time the websites were modified to serve up a network investigative technique (NIT), which would attempt to unmask visitors by revealing their IP address, operating system and web brower..\n\nThe NIT was successful in revealing approximately 25 domestic users as well as numerous foreign users.\nThe NIT code was revealed as part of the case \"USA v Cottom et al\". Researchers from University of Nebraska at Kearney and Dakota State University reviewed the NIT code and found that it was an Flash application that would ping a user's real IP address back to an FBI controlled server, rather than routing their traffic through the Tor network and protecting their identity. It used a technique from Metasploit's \"decloaking engine\" and only affected users who had not updated their Tor web browser. An investigation by Daily Dot claimed that the NIT was created by former part-time employee of Tor Project and Vidalia developer Matthew Edman and was internally known as \"Cornhusker\".\n\nThe US Department of Justice noted in December 2015 that besides McGrath, 18 users in the USA had been convicted as a result of the operation. One user caught by the NIT had accessed the site for only nine minutes and had since wiped his computer, yet a months-later police search of his home and digital devices found (through digital forensics) image thumbnails indicating past presence of downloaded child pornography, as well as text instructions on accessing and downloading child pornography. Another user was unmasked through his messages with an undercover FBI agent, and this user turned out to be Timothy DeFoggi, who was at that time the Acting Director of Cybersecurity at the United States Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n"}

At the meetings there is also a possibility to sign the MoU.\n\nThe First Meeting of Signatories took place in Apia, Samoa, 6 March 2007. During the meeting representative of two range States, Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands, signed the MoU. Furthermore, the conservation status of the Pacific Islands Cetaceans was reviewed, as well as the implementation of the MoU and Action Plan. All the current Signatories were represented at the meeting. Non-Signatory range States present during the meeting were Tonga, Kiribati, Tuvalu and the United States as well as several NGO’s such as IFAW and WDCS.\n\nThe Second Meeting of Signatories was held in Auckland, New Zealand, 28–29 July 2009. At the meeting the Pitcairn Islands, the South Pacific Whale Research Consortium and Whales Alive were added to the Signatories. A proposal, subject to funding, was endorsed to appoint an officier to be based at SPREP to co-ordinate the MoU and to be responsible for CMS activities throughout the region. Moreover, the meeting adopted a Whale and Dolphin Action Plan 2009–2012, based on a similar document developed by SPREP, as an Action Plan for the MoU. The plan emphasis on increasing capacity, awareness and understanding in the region. It outlines how communities can benefit from whale-and dolphin-based tourism. A proposal to develop an Oceania Humpback Whale Recovery Plan was also endorsed. Finally, a Technical Advisory Group for the MoU was formed, consisting of nine specialist experts in the science of cetacean conservation, coordinated with WDCS.\n\nThe Third Meeting of Signatories took place in Noumea, New Caledonia, 8 September 2012. The meeting focused on the following subjects:\n\nThe CMS Secretariat – located in Bonn, Germany – acts as the secretariat to the MoU. The secretariat transmits reports received from Signatories to the other States, Territories concerned and any collaborating organisations together with an overview report that it compiles on the basis of the information at its disposal.\n\nCMS's key partner SPREP developed a Whale and Dolphin Action Plan, which was adopted in 2003 and was revised in 2007. This plan was appended to the MoU and formed the basis for on-the-ground conservation efforts throughout the region. In 2009, at the Second Meeting of Signatories, an Amending Protocol was adopted which replaced the Action Plan 2003–2007 in Annex 2 to the MoU with the Whale and Dolphin Action Plan 2009–2012, which is based on the SPREP Whale and Dolphin Action Plan. The Action Plans focus on the following subjects:\n\nThe Third Meeting of Signatories endorsed a recovery plan for the endangered humpback whale population in Oceania, and adopted a five-year Action Plan (2013–2017), previously adopted by SPREP members, for the MoU, outlining priorities for addressing threats, as well as increasing capacity and public awareness in the region.\n\nImplementation activities in different parts of the region have included:\n\nThe Year of the Dolphin 2007–2008 campaign achieved a major outreach effort by CMS and its cetacean-related agreements worldwide.\n\nThe Government of Samoa, with co-funding from the CMS Secretariat, drawing on a voluntary contribution from Australia, conducted a cetacean survey in 2010 which confirmed the importance of Samoan waters for Humpback whales and other Cetacean species such as Spinner dolphins.\n\nAs part of the Partnership Agreement between WDCS and CMS an online Diversity Database was developed and is now fully online. This multilingual tool makes Country/Territory and species specific information freely and easily available to all Pacific Islands Governments, tracking information like habitat type, behaviour during the sighting, number of animals per sighting and any threats that might be related if the sighting is a stranding. CMS and CITES Appendices listings are also noted, as well as meeting reports and photos if available.\n\n"}

The Court found that section 179(1)(b) of the Criminal Code for vagrancy was overbroad and thus violated section 7 and could not be saved under section 1.\n\nIn 1987, Heywood was convicted under section 246.1(1) (now s. 271(1)) of the Criminal Code for sexual assault of children. The conviction made him subject to section 179(1)(b) which prevented certain convicted individuals from loitering.\n\nIn July 1989, Heywood was arrested in Beacon Hill Park in Victoria for loitering \"at or near a playground\" under section 179(1). He had been spotted several times previously near the playground carrying a camera with a telephoto lens. Upon arrest the police got a search warrant and found collections of pictures of children at play.\n\nAt trial, Heywood argued that the law violated section 7, 11(d), 12, and 15 of the Charter. The court found a violation of 7 and 11(d) which was justified under section 1. Heywood was convicted. On appeal to the Supreme Court of the province, then to the provincial Court of Appeal the conviction was upheld. Finally, the Supreme Court of Canada affirmed the violations of section 7 and 11(d) but also found that they could not be saved under section 1, and so the conviction was overturned.\n\nIn a 5 to 4 decision, the Court dismissed the appeal, finding a section 7 violation that could not be saved. The majority was written by Cory J. with Lamer C.J., Sopinka, Iacobucci, and Major JJ. concurring.\n\nThe case turned on the interpretation of the word \"loiter\" in section 179(1)(b) which states:\n\nCory states that the word should be given its ordinary, dictionary meaning, which is \"to stand idly around, hang around, linger, tarry, saunter, delay, dawdle\", and it does not contain any element of malevolent intent. He further claims that such a meaning supports the purpose of the section to protect children. \"Malevolent intent\" - a lesser degree of intent than unlawful intent - is too broad, vague, and subjective, says Cory.\n\nGiven this interpretation, Cory finds that the law infringes the principles of fundamental justice as it is more restrictive than necessary and applies too broadly. That is, \"without prior notice to the accused, to too many places, to too many people, for an indefinite period with no possibility of review\".\n\nThe dissent, written by Gonthier J., with La Forest, L'Heureux-Dubé, and McLachlin JJ. concurring, found that the word \"loiter\" required an element of \"malevolent intent\" and therefore was not overbroad and did not violate section 7.\n\n"}

This sets out the policies and procedures that need to be adopted and followed by the organisation and its animal ethics committee (AEC). Every project must be approved and monitored by an AEC which includes lay members. The principles of the Three Rs are embodied in the Animal Welfare Act, the operation of all AECs, and all activities that involve the use of animals in research.\n\nIn New Zealand, it is legal under the Animal Welfare Act 1999 (the Act) to use animals for research, testing and teaching (RTT) purposes. However, because the nature of this work may, in some cases, mean that potential benefits to humans, other animals or the environment may result in some harm to animals, such use carries significant responsibilities and strict legislative obligations.\n\nThe Ministry for Primary Industries reported that 310,287 animals were used in New Zealand in 2014. The most common species used were cattle (24.3%), mice (18.8%), sheep (14.4%), fish (13.3%), birds (10.2%) and deer (8.1%). The large number of livestock used in research reflects the large amount of agricultural research conducted in New Zealand.\n\nThe most common areas of research were 'Basic biological research' (24.3%), 'veterinary research' (19.2%), 'teaching' (16.9%) and 'animal husbandry' (15.4%). According to the Ministry for Primary Industries, only 24% of animals die, or are euthanised, as part of the research. 1.9% of animals used in 2014 were transgenic.\n\nPart 6 of the Act applies specifically to the use of animals for RTT purposes.\n\nUnder the Act:\n\n\nThe Three Rs – Replacement, Reduction and Refinement – relate to the ethical use of animals in RTT. \n\nThe importance of the Three Rs is demonstrated by the New Zealand Three Rs Programme, a collaboration between the Massey University Animal Welfare Science and Bioethics Centre, MPI, the Australian and New Zealand Council for the Care of Animals in Research and Teaching (ANZCCART) and NAEAC. The key aims of the Programme are:\n\n\nThe Three Rs have been incorporated into New Zealand’s legislation as can be seen in the following section on AEC considerations.\n\nThe legislation requires that AEC members consider any RTT project using animals. Their questions must include the following:\n\n\nIn considering projects, AECs may approve the work, they may require certain conditions to be put in place before approval is granted, or they may reject the proposal. They are also required to monitor compliance with any approved project, and can suspend or revoke the approval if necessary.\n\nThe National Animal Ethics Advisory Committee (NAEAC) claims to be an independent committee whose membership includes animal welfare experts, veterinarians, scientists and lay people. It claims to provide independent, expert advice to the Minister for Primary Industries on policy and practices relating to the use of animals in RTT. The committee also provides advice and support to AECs to maximise good decision-making.

{"id": "398268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=398268", "title": "Regulation of sport", "text": "Regulation of sport\n\nThe regulation of sport is usually done by a sport governing body for each sport, resulting in a core of relatively invariant, agreed rules. People responsible for leisure activities often seek recognition and respectability as sports by joining sports federations such as the International Olympic Committee, or by forming their own regulatory body. In this way sports evolve from leisure activity to more formal sports: relatively recent newcomers are BMX cycling, snowboarding, wrestling, etc. Some of these activities have been popular but uncodified pursuits for different lengths of time. Indeed, the formal regulation of sport is a relatively modern and increasing development. This method promotes a sport globally, in a very successful way. It also promotes the universality of each sport, by ensuring that the same gameplay rules are being practiced worldwide, using a standardized/homogenous international gameplay rule system (sanctioned by the respective international sports governing bodies) that is applied uniformly on all member associations and recognized leagues. Examples are FIFA in association football and FIBA in basketball, which have regulated international gameplay rules that are even practiced within US sports leagues today, despite not practicing them historically (which therefore meant that many US sports leagues weren't recognized by international governing bodies in the past, until they began to adopt international rules). In the sport of basketball the defender/defense cannot call foul.\n\nFormula One motor racing is an example of strict and changing regulation, where the regulating body appears to control rather than to simply define the sport. There have been major changes in the rules of F1 recently, almost on an annual basis, and more are planned. Sometimes this is done for safety reasons, sometimes to make the racing more interesting as a spectator sport, and sometimes to promote competition through involvement of smaller teams. Some changes make overtaking more probable for example or reduce the probability of an overwhelming technical advantage by any one team. Although heavily regulated, most people agree that the sport has thereby greatly benefitted, not least through dramatic leaps in safety.\n\nThe degree of organisation can vary from national or worldwide competitions for the sport, or it can occur in a purely \"ad hoc\", spontaneous way. A sport may be played individually (e.g. time trialling in cycling) or in a team, or just for recreation and well being (e.g. swimming).\n\nSome challenging situations have had to be dealt with when there is an overlap of the regulation of the sport with other forms of regulation, e.g. safety (There have been serious losses of life in football audiences, through stand collapses or poor crowd management), or simple laws of the land (Some inadvertent or otherwise physical interchanges occur between participants: when is it acceptable for the sport regulating authority alone to investigate and if necessary punish these? Can there be economic or public relations pressures affecting these issues?)\n\nThe broadcasting of sports events is also highly regulated, with contracts limiting who can show footage.\n\n"}
{"id": "30560133", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30560133", "title": "Run-around coil", "text": "Run-around coil\n\nA run-around coil is a type of energy recovery heat exchanger most often positioned within the supply and exhaust air streams of an air handling system, or in the exhaust gases of an industrial process, to recover the heat energy. Generally, it refers to any intermediate stream used to transfer heat between two streams that are not directly connected for reasons of safety or practicality. It may also be referred to as a run-around loop, a pump-around coil or a liquid coupled heat exchanger.\n\nA typical run-around coil system comprises two or more multi-row finned tube coils connected to each other by a pumped pipework circuit. The pipework is charged with a heat exchange fluid, normally water, which picks up heat from the exhaust air coil and gives up heat to the supply air coil before returning again. Thus heat from the exhaust air stream is transferred through the pipework coil to the circulating fluid, and then from the fluid through the pipework coil to the supply air stream.\n\nThe use of this system is generally limited to situations where the air streams are separated and no other type of device can be utilised since the heat recovery efficiency is lower than other forms of air-to-air heat recovery. Gross efficiencies are usually in the range of 40 to 50%, but more significantly seasonal efficiencies of this system can be very low, due to the extra electrical energy used by the pumped fluid circuit.\n\nThe fluid circuit, as well as containing the circulating pump, will also contain an expansion vessel, to accommodate changes in fluid pressure; a fill device, to ensure the system remains charged; controls to bypass and shut down the system when not required, and various other safety devices and ancillaries. Pipework runs should be kept as short as possible and should be sized for low velocities to keep frictional losses to a minimum, and hence reduce pump energy consumption. It is possible however to recover some of this energy in the form of heat given off by the motor if a glandless pump is used, where a water jacket surrounds the motor stator, thus water passing through the pump will pick up some of its heat.\n\nThe pumped fluid will have to be protected from freezing in certain climates, and as such is normally treated with a glycol based anti-freeze. This also reduces the specific heat capacity of the fluid and increases the viscosity, increasing pump power consumption, further reducing the seasonal efficiency of the device. For example, a 20% glycol mixture will provide protection down to , but will increase system resistance by 15%.\n\nFor the finned tube coil design, there is a performance maximum corresponding to an eight- or ten-row coil, above this the fan and pump motor energy consumption increases substantially and seasonal efficiency starts to drop off. The main cause of increased energy consumption lies with the fan, for the same face velocity, fewer coil rows will decrease air pressure drop and increase water pressure drop but the total energy consumption will usually be less than that for a greater number of coil rows with higher air pressure drops and lower water pressure drops.\n\nNormally the heat transfer between airstreams provided by the device is termed as 'sensible', which is the exchange of energy, or enthalpy, resulting in a change in temperature of the medium (air in this case), but with no change in moisture content.\n\n\n"}

The complainants alleged a violation of section 14 of \"The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code\" (\"SHRC\"), which prohibits \"publication or display of any representation that exposes or tends to expose to hatred, ridicules, belittles or otherwise affronts the dignity of any person or class of persons on the basis of a prohibited ground\". Sexual orientation was one such prohibited ground. A Saskatchewan human rights tribunal heard the case, holding that the contents of each flyer objectively contravened section 14 of the \"SHRC\", and that the provision did not unreasonably restrict Whatcott's section 2(b) \"Charter\" rights. The Tribunal prohibited Whatcott from further distributing the flyers and awarded compensation to the complainants.\n\nUpon judicial review to the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench in 2007, the trial judge upheld the Tribunal's findings with respect to the violation of section 14 of the \"SHRC\" and its constitutionality. In 2010, the case was appealed to the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal. The court held that the tribunal and the trial judge had erred by considering only certain phrases from the flyers and that the flyers were not a prohibited hate publication. \n\n26 third parties acted as intervenors during oral hearings in 2011. Rothstein J wrote the reasons for a unanimous Supreme Court.\n\nRothstein J began by considering the definition of \"hatred\" as contemplated in \"R v Taylor\", where the Supreme Court had found that \"hatred\" as used in the \"Canadian Human Rights Act\" \"refers to unusually strong and deep-felt emotions of detestation, calumny and vilification\". Rothstein J identified two primary difficulties arising alongside the \"Taylor\" hatred doctrine; namely, that hatred is inherently subjective, which could conflict with the court's attempt at objectivity, and that it could lead to a \"mistaken propensity to focus on the ideas being expressed, rather than on the \"effect\" of the expression\". In response to these criticisms, Rothstein J adapted the \"Taylor\" standard by holding that it should be conducted objectively, that \"hatred\" should be interpreted as \"extreme manifestations of the emotion described by the words 'detestation' and 'vilification'\", a threshold which would not include merely repugnant or offensive expression, and that tribunals should consider the effect of the expression, not its inherent offensiveness.\n\nRothstein J next analyzed the constitutionality of section 14(1)(b) of the \"SHRC\", applying the correctness standard of review. Rothstein J held that the expression was protected by section 2(b) of the \"Charter\", and proceeded to conduct a section 1 \"Oakes\" test. Rothstein J described the purpose of the legislation as \"reducing the harmful effects and social costs of discrimination by tackling certain causes of discriminatory activity\", noting its emotional and societal effects on vulnerable groups and its ability to impede democratic discussion. Thus Rothstein J found that the provision was prescribed by law and that its objective was pressing and substantial.\n\nNext, Rothstein J considered whether the section 14(1)(b) limitation on free expression was rationally connected to the legislation's purpose. Rothstein J wrote that such expression \"must seek to marginalize the group by affecting its social status and acceptance in the eyes of the majority\" in order for a rational connection to exist. Since section 14(1)(b) only captured hate speech communicated in public, and since it applied only to expression based on existing prohibited grounds of discrimination, Rothstein J found that the provision was rationally connected to the legislative objective. However, Rothstein J found that the wording \"ridicules, belittles or otherwise affronts the dignity of\" contained in section 14(1)(b) of the \"SHRC\" was constitutionally invalid, since the threshold set by that language was too low and thus did not align with the legislation's purpose. The offending words were removed from the section.\n\nRothstein J then considered whether the provision minimally impaired the impugned right to freedom of expression. Rothstein J answered affirmatively, holding that alternative measures, including a \"marketplace of ideas\" and an expanded role for the criminal law in hate speech cases, would not achieve the legislative objective, or would only achieve it ineffectively. Rothstein J held also that the provision was not overbroad once the language \"ridicules, belittles or otherwise affronts the dignity of\" was removed.\n\nRothstein J rejected Whatcott's argument that the expression at issue was protected because it was political in nature:\n\nRothstein J also rejected Whatcott's submission that his expression was protected because it differentiated between homosexual orientation and activity. Instead, Rothstein J held that \"attacks on conduct [that is a crucial aspect of the identity of the vulnerable group] stand as a proxy for attacks on the group itself\". Rothstein J also rejected arguments that the \"SHRC\" was overbroad because it did not require proof of intent or harm and because it did not offer any defences. Rothstein J instead wrote that the analysis must focus on the effects of the impugned expression, not the communicator’s intent, that the legislature is \"entitled to a reasonable apprehension of societal harm as a result of hate speech\", and that the absence of defences in the \"SHRC\" was not determinative; truthful statements or sincerely held beliefs do not affect the analysis, which must be undertaken from an objective standpoint.\n\nRothstein J found that the benefits of the section 14(1)(b) prohibition on hate speech outweighed the \"detrimental effect of restricting expression which, by its nature, does little to promote the values underlying freedom of expression\".\n\nNext, Rothstein J considered whether section 14(1)(b) of the \"SHRC\" infringed the freedom of religion enshrined in section 2(a) of the \"Charter\". Rothstein J concluded that section 2(a) had been infringed because Whatcott had a sincere religious belief and since section 14(1)(b) would significantly interfere with his ability to communicate his sincerely held beliefs. However, Rothstein J found that the infringement was justified under section 1 of the \"Charter\", but again held that the wording \"ridicules, belittles or otherwise affronts the dignity of\" was unconstitutional.\n\nRothstein J held that the standard of review of the Tribunal's decision was reasonableness, based on the Court's reasoning in \"Dunsmuir v New Brunswick\". Rothstein found that the Tribunal's decision to read certain parts of the flyer in isolation was reasonable, since \"even one phrase or sentence... found to bring the publication, as a whole, in contravention of the \"Code\"... precludes publication of the flyer in its current form\". Rothstein J also held that the Tribunal's application of section 14(1)(b) to two of Whatcott's flyers (Flyers D and E) was reasonable, since those flyers portrayed the targeted group \"as a menace that could threaten the safety and well-being of others\", objectively depicted them as \"inferior [and] untrustworthy\", \"[vilified] those of same-sex orientation by portraying them as them as child abusers or predators\", and called for discrimination against the portrayed group.\n\nHowever, Rothstein J found that the Tribunal's decision with respect to two other flyers (Flyers F and G) was unreasonable, since a reasonable person would not have found them to subject homosexuals to \"detestation\" and vilification\". In particular, Rothstein J noted that a Bible passage that Whatcott had quoted in Flyers F and G was not hateful expression, writing that \"it would only be unusual circumstances and context that could transform a simple reading or publication of a religion’s holy text into what could objectively be viewed as hate speech\".\n\nRothstein J reinstated the compensation for those complainants who had received flyers which were in contravention of the \"SHRC\".\n\nReaction to the Supreme Court's decision was mixed. Andrew Coyne called \"Whatcott\" a \"calamitous decision\", criticizing the Supreme Court's loose definition of \"harm\" and Rothstein J's finding that \"truth may be used for widely disparate ends\". Charlie Gillis, writing for Macleans, described the decision as a \"missed opportunity to erect robust legal protections around a bedrock Canadian value\".\n\nPearl Eliadis, writing for the Montreal Gazette, called the decision \"reasonable and balanced\" and found that it would \"provide comfort to those concerned about being found liable for \"offending\" others\".\n"}

The centre, owned by Bausch and Lomb, and run by Charles River Laboratories, Inc. for Shamrock (GB) Ltd, closed in 2000 after a 15-month protest by British animal rights activists, who campaigned under the name \"Save the Shamrock Monkeys.\"\n\nThe company was set up in 1954, trading in wild-caught primates until 1993 and captive-bred ones thereafter. The animals were held in windowless cabins in the company's facility, surrounded by 16 ft-high fences, razor wire, and cameras. A touch-sensitive wire ran along the base of the perimeter, with CCTV cameras zooming in on any spot that was touched.\n\nPrimates captured from the wild, or purchased from breeding facilities, were held there for two months for tests, until they were ready to be sold to animal-testing laboratories across Europe. It was Europe's largest supplier of primates to laboratories, and held up to 350 monkeys at a time, processing 2,500 a year on average, and selling them for around £1,600 each. The company bought and sold baboons, macaques, grivet, patas, and squirrel monkeys; almost all of the 2,467 macaques used in British laboratories in 1998 came through Shamrock. Its customers included Huntingdon Life Sciences, SmithKline Beecham, GlaxoWellcome, the Porton Down military science park, and the Universities of Oxford, Cambridge, London, Glasgow, and Manchester, according to Animal Aid.\n\nAccording to Keith Mann, Shamrock also took primates from British zoos and theme parks, including 83 macaques from Longleat, 32 from Woburn Abbey, and several different species from Ravensden and Robin Hill on the Isle of Wight.\n\nThe company's main customer was Huntingdon Life Sciences, which in one year purchased 373 cage-bred macaques, 440 wild-caught monkeys, eight squirrel monkeys, and 37 baboons, according to documents obtained by activists. Keith Mann writes that Shamrock delivered nearly 50,000 monkeys to laboratories in Britain during the 1990s.\n\nIn 1992, an undercover investigation by the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV) found high mortality rates among the monkeys from enteritis and pneumonia, while other monkeys were being killed if they were underweight or suffered from deformities. The primates were allegedly denied socialization, stimulation, or environmental enrichment, and engaged in stereotypical behaviors, such as continuous rocking, twisting, self-mutilation, and wailing. BUAV also witnessed rough handling by staff, who were alleged to have been inadequately trained.\n\nFollowing the BUAV investigation, the company announced in 1993 that it would stop buying wild primates. It started trading instead in primates from breeding centres in China, Mauritius, and the Philippines, although no laws exist in these countries to prevent stocks of primates being brought in from the wild.\n\n\n"}

It was subsequently used by U.S. Gold and for several titles by Ultimate Play the Game, amongst others. Speedlock was also ported to the Amstrad CPC in 1985.\n\nThe system used several advanced features of the Spectrum's architecture, such as the memory refresh register and parity branch instructions of the Z80 processor, which made it harder to create illegitimate copies without the protection. Early versions used a set of audible \"clicking\" lead tones when loading a program, later versions did not include this, but instead had a counter showing the time left to finish loading the program similar to that of Technician Ted and Fairlight.\n\nSome companies created software to bypass protection schemes, including Speedlock, for the purpose of backing up or transferring to Microdrive, the Spectrum +3, or other proprietary disk systems.\n\n"}

{"id": "249858", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=249858", "title": "Tying (commerce)", "text": "Tying (commerce)\n\nTying (informally, product tying) is the practice of selling one product or service as a mandatory addition to the purchase of a different product or service. In legal terms, a \"tying sale\" makes the sale of one good (the \"tying good\") to the de facto customer (or de jure customer) conditional on the purchase of a second distinctive good (the \"tied good\"). Tying is often illegal when the products are not naturally related. It is related to but distinct from freebie marketing, a common (and legal) method of giving away (or selling at a substantial discount) one item to ensure a continual flow of sales of another related item.\n\nSome kinds of tying, especially by contract, have historically been regarded as anti-competitive practices. The basic idea is that consumers are harmed by being forced to buy an undesired good (the tied good) in order to purchase a good they actually want (the tying good), and so would prefer that the goods be sold separately. The company doing this bundling may have a significantly large market share so that it may impose the tie on consumers, despite the forces of market competition. The tie may also harm other companies in the market for the tied good, or who sell only single components.\n\nOne effect of tying can be that low quality products achieve a higher market share than would otherwise be the case.\n\nTying may also be a form of price discrimination: people who use more razor blades, for example, pay more than those who just need a one-time shave. Though this may improve overall welfare, by giving more consumers access to the market, such price discrimination can also transfer consumer surpluses to the producer. Tying may also be used with or in place of patents or copyrights to help protect entry into a market, discouraging innovation.\n\nTying is often used when the supplier makes one product that is critical to many customers. By threatening to withhold that key product unless others are also purchased, the supplier can increase sales of less necessary products.\n\nIn the United States, most states have laws against tying, which are enforced by state governments. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice enforces federal laws against tying through its Antitrust Division.\n\nHorizontal tying is the practice of requiring consumers to pay for an unrelated product or service together with the desired one. A hypothetical example would be for Bic to sell its pens only with Bic lighters. (However, a company may offer a limited free item with another purchase as a promotion.)\n\nVertical tying is the practice of requiring customers to purchase related products or services together, from the same company. For example, a company might mandate that its automobiles could only be serviced by its own dealers. In an effort to curb this, many jurisdictions require that warranties not be voided by outside servicing; for example, see the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act in the United States.\n\nCertain tying arrangements are illegal in the United States under both the Sherman Antitrust Act, and Section 3 of the Clayton Act. A tying arrangement is defined as \"an agreement by a party to sell one product but only on the condition that the buyer also purchases a different (or tied) product, or at least agrees he will not purchase the product from any other supplier.\" Tying may be the action of several companies as well as the work of just one firm. Success on a tying claim typically requires proof of four elements: (1) two separate products or services are involved; (2) the purchase of the tying product is conditioned on the additional purchase of the tied product; (3) the seller has sufficient market power in the market for the tying product; (4) a not insubstantial amount of interstate commerce in the tied product market is affected.\n\nFor at least three decades, the Supreme Court defined the required \"economic power\" to include just about any departure from perfect competition, going so far as to hold that possession of a copyright or even the existence of a tie itself gave rise to a presumption of economic power. The Supreme Court has since held that a plaintiff must establish the sort of market power necessary for other antitrust violations in order to prove sufficient \"economic power\" necessary to establish a per se tie. More recently, the Court has eliminated any presumption of market power based solely on the fact that the tying product is patented or copyrighted.\n\nIn recent years, changing business practices surrounding new technologies have put the legality of tying arrangements to the test. Although the Supreme Court still considers some tying arrangements as \"per se\" illegal, the Court actually uses a rule-of-reason analysis, requiring an analysis of foreclosure effects and an affirmative defense of efficiency justifications.\n\nThe tying of Apple products is an example of commercial tying that has caused recent controversy. When Apple initially released the iPhone on June 29, 2007, it was sold exclusively with AT&T (formerly Cingular) contracts in the United States. To enforce this exclusivity, Apple employed a type of software lock that ensured the phone would not work on any network besides AT&T's. Related to the concept of bricking, any user who tried to unlock or otherwise tamper with the locking software ran the risk of rendering their iPhone permanently inoperable.\nThis caused complaints among many consumers, as they were forced to pay an additional early termination fee of $175 if they wanted to unlock the device safely for use on a different carrier. Other companies such as Google complained that tying encourages a more closed-access-based wireless service. Many questioned the legality of the arrangement, and in October 2007 a class-action lawsuit was filed against Apple, claiming that its exclusive agreement with AT&T violates California antitrust law. The suit was filed by the Law Office of Damian R. Fernandez on behalf of California resident Timothy P. Smith, and ultimately sought to have an injunction issued against Apple to prevent it from selling iPhones with any kind of software lock.\n\nIn July 2010, federal regulators clarified the issue when they determined it was lawful to unlock (or in other terms, \"jail break\") the iPhone, declaring that there was no basis for copyright law to assist Apple in protecting its restrictive business model.\nJail breaking is removing operating system or hardware restrictions imposed on an iPhone (or other device). If done successfully, this allows one to run any application on the phone they choose, including applications not authorized by Apple. Apple told regulators that modifying the iPhone operating system leads to the creation of an infringing derivative work that is protected by copyright law. This means that the license on the operating system forbids software modification. However, regulators agreed that modifying an iPhone's firmware/operating system to enable it to run an application that Apple has not approved fits comfortably within the four corners of fair use.\n\nAnother prominent case involving a tying claim was \"United States v. Microsoft\". By some accounts, Microsoft ties together Microsoft Windows, Internet Explorer, Windows Media Player, Outlook Express and Microsoft Office. The United States claimed that the bundling of Internet Explorer (IE) to sales of Windows 98, making IE difficult to remove from Windows 98 (e.g., not putting it on the \"Remove Programs\" list), and designing Windows 98 to work \"unpleasantly\" with Netscape Navigator constituted an illegal tying of Windows 98 and IE. Microsoft's counterargument was that a web browser and a mail reader are simply part of an operating system, included with other personal computer operating systems, and the integration of the products was technologically justified. Just as the definition of a car has changed to include things that used to be separate products, such as speedometers and radios, Microsoft claimed the definition of an operating system has changed to include their formerly separate products. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected Microsoft's claim that Internet Explorer was simply one facet of its operating system, but the court held that the tie between Windows and Internet Explorer should be analyzed deferentially under the Rule of Reason. The U.S. government claim settled before reaching final resolution.\n\nAs to the tying of Office, parallel cases against Microsoft brought by State Attorneys General included a claim for harm in the market for office productivity applications. The Attorneys General abandoned this claim when filing an amended complaint. The claim was revived by Novell where they alleged that manufacterers of computers (\"OEMs\") were charged less for their Windows bulk purchases if they agreed to bundle Office with every PC sold than if they gave computer purchasers the choice whether or not to buy Office along with their machines — making their computer prices less competitive in the market. The Novell litigation is still ongoing.\n\nMicrosoft has also tied its software to the third-party Android mobile operating system, by requiring manufacturers that license patents it claims covers the OS and smartphones to ship Microsoft Office Mobile and Skype applications on the devices.\n\nIn 1970, Congress enacted section 106 of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 (BHCA), the anti-tying provision, which is codified at 12 U.S.C. § 1972. The statute was designed to prevent banks, whether large or small, state or federal, from imposing anticompetitive conditions on their customers. Tying is an antitrust violation, but the Sherman and Clayton Acts did not adequately protect borrowers from being required to accept conditions to loans issued by banks, and section 106 was specifically designed to apply to and remedy such bank misconduct.\n\nBanks are allowed to take measures to protect their loans and to safeguard the value of their investments, such as requiring security or guaranties from borrowers. The statute exempts so-called “traditional banking practices” from its \"per se\" illegality, and thus its purpose is not so much to limit banks' lending practices, as it is to ensure that the practices used are fair and competitive. A majority of claims brought under the BHCA are denied. Banks still have quite a bit of leeway in fashioning loan agreements, but when a bank clearly steps over the bounds of propriety, the plaintiff is compensated with treble damages.\n\nAt least four regulatory agencies including the Federal Reserve Board oversee the activities of banks, their holding companies, and other related depository institutions. While each type of depository institution has a “primary regulator”, the nation’s “dual banking” system allows concurrent jurisdiction among the different regulatory agencies. With respect to the anti-tying provision, the Fed takes the preeminent role in relation to the other financial institution regulatory agencies, which reflects that it was considered the least biased (in favor of banks) of the regulatory agencies when section 106 was enacted.\n\n\n"}

Touche, 174 N.E. 441 (1932) is a US tort law case regarding negligent misstatement, decided by Cardozo, C.J. It contained the now famous line on \"floodgates\" that the law should not admit \"to a liability in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class.\"\n\nIn 1924 the auditors of Touche Niven (Touche, Niven & Company) gave the rubber importer, Fred Stern and Company, an unqualified audit certificate, having failed to discover that management had falsified entries to overstate accounts receivable. The auditors knew that the accounts when certified would be used to raise money and for that purpose supplied 32 certified and serially numbered copies: p. 442. On the faith of one of those copies, given to it on its demand, the plaintiff, Ultramares Corporation, lent Fred Stern and Company money. Stern declared bankruptcy in 1925. Ultramares sued Touche Niven for the amount of the Stern debt, declaring that a careful audit would have shown Stern to be insolvent. The audit was found to be negligent, but not fraudulent. The judge set this finding aside based on the doctrine of privity, which protects auditors from third party suits. An intermediate appellate court reinstated the negligence verdict. The case then went to the New York Court of Appeals, Judge Benjamin Cardozo presiding.\n\nCardozo, C.J., held that the claim in negligence failed on the ground that the auditors owed the plaintiff no duty of care, there being no sufficiently proximate relationship.\n\nA requirement of privity, not of contract but of relationship, was laid down.\n\n\nInformation Negligently Supplied for the Guidance of others (1) One who, in the course of his business, profession or employment, or in any other transaction in which he has a pecuniary interest, supplies false information for the guidance of others in their business transactions, is subject to liability for pecuniary loss caused to them by their justifiable reliance upon the information, if he fails to exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating the information. (2) Except as stated in subsection (3), the liability stated in subsection (1) is limited to loss suffered (a) by the person or one of a limited group of persons for whose benefit and guidance he intends to supply the information or knows that the recipient intends to supply it; and (b) through reliance upon it in a transaction that he intends the information to influence or knows that the recipient so intends or in a substantially similar transaction.

By making the aretaic turn in legal theory, virtue jurisprudence focuses on the importance of character and human excellence or virtue to questions about the nature of law, the content of the law, and judging.\n\nAmong the topics encompassed by virtue jurisprudence are:\n\nThe most developed aspect of virtue jurisprudence is its distinctive theory of judging. A virtue-centered theory of judging offers an account of the characteristics or excellences that make for a good judge. These include: judicial temperance, judicial courage, judicial temperament, judicial intelligence, judicial wisdom, and justice. Although every theory of judging can incorporate some account of judicial virtue, a virtue-centered theory of judging makes the distinctive claim that the judicial virtues are central, \"i.e.\" that they have basic explanatory and normative significance.\n\nMany of the criticisms of virtue jurisprudence are parallel to those offered in the context of debates over virtue ethics. Some of these include:\n\nAristotle argued that the inculcation of promotion of virtue was the proper end of law. Aquinas argued that true laws (which are rational) can teach virtue by being internalized by those who already possess sufficient virtue to grasp the purpose of the law. Even those who have not yet achieved this level of virtue can be coerced into obedience to the law, and this may enable them to become more virtuous.\n\nA contemporary restatement of this view is found in the writings of Robert George. In his book, \"Making Men Moral\", George argues for the promotion of virtue as the end of law and against the contrary view that the purpose of law is the protection of rights.\n\nThe phrase \"virtue jurisprudence\" is usually applied in the context of contemporary Western philosophical thinking about law. There are, however, important ideas about the relationship between law and virtue in other intellectual traditions. One example is provided by Confucian ideas about virtue. In the Analects, Confucius argues that a society in which people are virtuous would have no need of judges, rules, or jurisprudence because people would be able to resolve social conflicts by themselves. Thus, it is argued that the idea of virtue is opposed to the idea of law.\n\nIt can be argued that even virtuous citizens might disagree about the application of the law, especially where their own interests or ideological commitments are at stake. However, this argument is rather foreign to both traditional and modern Chinese political thought. Chinese political theory tends to assume that the truly virtuous are selfless to the point of martyrdom and would not consider their own personal interests and that the virtuous are able to transcend ideology. At the same time, traditional Chinese political thought regards those with absolute virtue to be historically extremely rare, and that most people, including the Emperor and his officials, are prone to both corruption and error. Consequently, there is a belief that law and indeed government is an unfortunate necessity in dealing with an imperfect world and with imperfect people.\n\nThe view that the inculcation of virtue is the proper end of legislation contrasts markedly with traditional Chinese thinking on the subject, which argues that laws exist because men are lacking in virtue. Confucianism places very little faith on the ability of law or external pressure to make men moral but rather believes that virtue must come from introspection and education. Throughout Chinese political and intellectual history, the Confucian view on law was frequently contrasted in discourse and practice with Chinese Legalist philosophy.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1203430", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1203430", "title": "Warez group", "text": "Warez group\n\nA warez group is a tightly organised group of people involved in creating and/or distributing warez such as movies, music or software (\"warez\") in The Scene. There are different types of these groups in the Scene: \"release groups\" and \"courier groups\". Groups often compete, as being the first to bring out a new quality release can bring status and respect - a type of \"vanity contest\". The warez groups care about the image others have of them.\n\n\"ANALOG Computing\" observed in 1984 that software piracy did not make sense economically to those performing the software cracking. The primary motivation of warez groups is not monetary gain, but the excitement of breaking rules and beating competitors. Although at least two Scene groups have been asking for bitcoin donations, PoWeRUp and spamTV. Individual members of these groups are usually also the authors of cracks and keygens.\n\nThere are warez groups publishing new content outside of the Scene, often referred to as \"P2P groups\". They are a lot more accessible for people with access to new movies and are not limited to a set of rules and regulations.\n\nThe FBI have been combating warez groups with Operation: Cyberstrike, Operation Buccaneer, Operation Fastlink, Operation Safehaven and Operation Site Down. Similarly, the P2P group IMAGiNE has been disbanded due to law enforcement actions.\n\nSome game and software groups include Razor 1911, Reloaded, DrinkOrDie, Pirates With Attitude, Class, Myth and Fairlight. For a larger list, see the list of warez groups.\n\nRelease groups are responsible for making warez releases. For example they rip a movie from DVD, encode it to a video file and chop it up in smaller pieces before sharing it. They are at the top of the warez world. An announcement of the release shows up in pre databases after making the release available on their affiliate sites. Access to the original software products is necessary to write cracks and keygens so they share original media among each other, usually using private sites and servers. Communication between members happens with IRC.\n\nWarez groups typically add NFO files with their releases. Due to the nature of the scene, not much is known about these groups. Most groups follow one of the different warez standards to prevent being nuked. Most groups are focused on a single category (music, movies, television, ...) or genre (e.g. metal music or graffiti).\n\nThe group members have different roles. Most groups have one or more group leaders, aided by people with assignments such as supplier, cracker or ripper. The members are mostly young men.\n\nCourier groups take releases and distribute them. This can be done using FXP to FTP sites. There are more couriers in the scene than there are crackers, suppliers and sites combined.\n\nCouriers are a specific class of topsite users who earn their access by uploading new releases and filling requests. When a courier gains access to a topsite, they are often required to pass a trial test such as uploading a certain amount in a short period of time.\n\nCouriers compete (race) against each other for respect, credits, access to other topsites, and fun. Private couriers often operate as independent (iND) couriers. Some couriers band together to form courier groups which provide support and friendship through camaraderie. Although it may be noted that Couriers/Racers are looked down upon more than ever by affiliates and topsite staff with the increase of scripts that perform the couriers tasks automatically.\n\n"}
{"id": "379470", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=379470", "title": "Youth Criminal Justice Act", "text": "Youth Criminal Justice Act\n\nThe Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA; ) (the \"Act\") is a Canadian statute, which came into effect on April 1, 2003. It covers the prosecution of youths for criminal offences. The \"Act\" replaced the \"Young Offenders Act\", which itself was a replacement for the \"Juvenile Delinquents Act\".\n\nThe \"Act\" governs the application of criminal and correctional law to those 12 years old or older, but younger than 18 at the time of committing the offence (Section 2 of the YCJA). Youth aged 14 to 17 may be sentenced as adults under certain conditions, as described later on in the \"Act\". The Criminal Code, section 13, states \"No person shall be convicted of an offence in respect of an act or omission on their part while that person was under the age of twelve years.\"\n\nThe preamble of the \"Act\" recognizes that youth have rights protected by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Canadian Bill of Rights and the United Nation's Convention on the Rights of the Child.\n\nThe \"Act\" includes four general principles found in section 3(1).\n\nSubsection (a) addresses the basic principles of the \"Act\" and the \"Act\"'s intentions on dealing with young offenders and youth crime. More specifically, subsection (a) sets the basic principle that the YCJA attempts to address underlying behaviour, such as pre-existing conditions or circumstances that would lead to an offending behaviour. It also seeks to, above all, reintegrate young persons who commit offences into society through means of rehabilitation.\n\nSubsection (b) incorporates a recognition that young people need to be held accountable for their crimes, and have a greater opportunity to be rehabilitated and reintegrated into society. \"The criminal justice system for young persons must be separate from that of adults and emphasize the following:\"\n\nSubsection (c) is meant to reflect social values while taking into account each individual's unique situation. It outlines the parameters within which the measures taken against a youth offender are set:\n\nSubsection (d) describes the special considerations for criminal proceedings against young persons. It highlights four in particular.\n\nUnder Part 1 of the \"Act\", extrajudicial measures are used for responding to less serious youth crimes in a timely and effective manner. Police are the first officials to be encountered within the system and possess the power to use discretion in deciding whether to issue a warning, a police caution, or a charge. If the youth agrees, the police can also refer the youth to a program under section 7 of the \"Act\". If the police decide to refer the case to the courts, the Crown can choose to issue a Crown caution.\n\nIf a warning, caution or referral was issued it means that the police officer has taken no further action on the offence. If a warning, caution, or referral is not appropriate, an extrajudicial sanction may be considered as well.\n\nSection 4 of the \"Act\" sets out principles that govern the establishment of policies about extrajudicial measures:\n\n\nThese measures are applied by police and Crown attorneys with the intention that youth can be held liable through non-court measures for their offence(s).\n\nUnder Section 5 of the \"Act\", objectives of these measures are to:\n\nThese objectives are specially designed so that a wide range of diversionary options are available to achieve an array of objectives and it is important to take into consideration many factors when deciding on a fair response to the offence. For example, if the young person has already started reparation to the harm done to the victim, the person deciding on the type of extrajudicial measure should consider that factor when determining an appropriate response.\n\nThere are four types of extrajudicial measures (not including extrajudicial sanctions):\n\n\nAn extrajudicial sanction is defined as a type of \"extrajudicial measure\" used to deal with a young person only if they cannot be adequately dealt by a warning, caution or referral as outlined above. Conditions that dictate this are the seriousness of the offence, the nature and number of previous offences committed by the young person or any other aggravating circumstances. Extrajudicial sanctions examples include restitution or compensation, service to the victim or community, attendance and participating in counselling and treatment programs, etc.\n\nFormerly termed as \"alternative measures\" under the \"Young Offenders Act\" extrajudicial sanctions are important for they are a good alternative option to the formal court process for the young person. If they comply satisfactorily with the sanction the charge can be dismissed. However, failure to comply or unsatisfactory performance may result in a charge or return to court. The decision whether to apply an extrajudicial sanction lies in with the police officer, Crown Prosecutor, or other officials and in comparison to other types of extrajudicial measures, a more formal set of rules applies to extrajudicial sanctions. Further, although it appears that the charge has \"gone away\", if the youth reoffends the sanction can be brought up at the next hearing.\n\nExtrajudicial sanctions can only be used if:\n\n\nExtrajudicial sanctions cannot be used if:\n\nSection 18(1) of the Youth Justice Committees (YJCs) help in the administering of the \"Act\" by devolving power to the community. YJCs facilitate interaction between the victim and offender, and recommend appropriate programs/services to treat their situation. Each committee is a group of trained volunteers from the local community. Their main activities include the following:\n\na. for the youth charged with an offence:\nb. Reporting to the federal and provincial governments on whether protective measures of the act are followed\nc. Advising the federal and provincial governments on policies and procedures related to the youth criminal justice system\nd. Informing the public in respect of the YCJA and the youth criminal justice system; \ne. Setting up conferences\nf. Any other task assigned by The Attorney General of Canada or a provincial minister\n\nOperating under the paradigm of restorative justice, YJCs aim to \"strike the right balance between accountability and community intervention\" YJCs are used extensively in Manitoba, Alberta and New Brunswick. A committee's activity largely depends on volunteer efforts from its community. Trained members work to create extrajudicial measures for young people, but failure to comply with measures given ultimately results in return to the formal justice system.\n\nThe \"Act\" in Section 25(1) gives a youth the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay, which was amended by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. This means that young persons who are arrested or detained for any reason must be told of their right to obtain a lawyer before any lawful procedures are conducted. The youth must also be given the opportunity to obtain this counsel. If the youth does not have a lawyer present at the first court date, the judge must inform the youth of their right of counsel. Before accepting a plea, the court must\n\n\nThe young person has right to counsel upon arrest or detention, before a voluntary statement, during consideration of extrajudicial sanctions, and at a hearing. If the youth is denied legal aid for any reason, the court can order that counsel be given to the youth- in order to comply with the right to counsel If at any point the parent's interests and the youth's interests are in conflict, the presiding judge may also order counsel be obtained for the youth Even though right to counsel is guaranteed by the \"Act\", studies have shown that youth tend to not take advantage of counsel, leading many to question the validity and authenticity of Section 25(1).\n\nThe delivery of legal counsel has two primary models: Judicare and Staff delivery model text to display. In judicare delivery model, lawyers in private practice are issued certificates to provide legal aid to clients. In the staff lawyer system, the service is provided by lawyers that are employed directly by the legal aid plan. The proportion of Young offender legal aid is equally divided between the two. Section 25 of the \"Act\" outlines the young individual's right to counsel, which was amended from the Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms. The aim is to protect the youth's right to counsel in all stages of the youth justice process and ensure the individual understands the justice process. According to the \"Act\" section 25 (4): If the young individual is unable to obtain legal assistance or no legal aid program is available, the young offender is able to request counsel. The counsel to represent the young individual is to be appointed by the Attorney General according to the section 25(5) of the Youth Justice Act. For example, if the young individual is unable to afford a lawyer, he or she may request legal aid. If eligible, a lawyer will be appointed by the attorney general.\n\nThe Canadian Charter of rights and freedoms and the \"Act\" both hold the right to legal representation for youth. The purpose is to provide extensive opportunity for legal advocacy and advice prior to and during the court process. However, when a young person is not represented by counsel at trial or at a hearing, the justice presiding over the case or the youth justice court may allow youth to be assisted by an adult at the request of the young person For this to occur, the youth court of justice or the review board must find an adult who is deemed to be suitable in assisting the young person. This right is given to make the process for the young person easier, as the young person can obtain adult assistance from someone that they are more familiar with. Despite the fact that section 25(7) does not specify specific requirements for the ideal suitable adult, this tends to be assessed on a case by case basis to the specific needs of the young person.\n\nThe Statement of Right to Counsel requires that the young person be provided with a written statement that reminds them that they do have the right to request and be represented by legal counsel at any time during the judicial process. Included at various stages of the judicial process, the Statement, ensures that the young person remains alert to their rights, to the continued availability of counsel and to their options for counsel (i.e., Legal Aid). The Statement must be included with appearance notices or summons, arrest warrants, promises to appear, in all notifications of sentence review and also with all undertakings or recognisance that the young person may participate in under the auspices of the officer in charge. It must also be included with other notifications of legal proceedings such as custody continuations, conditional supervision, decision reviews and all youth justice court reviews. The repetition of the document serves as a reminder not only to the young person, but also to those within the judicial system that it is necessary to protect the rights of the young person and guarantee that those rights are upheld throughout the judicial process.\n\nEvery accused person in Canada has the right to be informed of their rights and what they are being charged of, according to the legal rights of the Arrest and Detention section of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. According to section 146 (2) (b) of the \"Act\", Young persons under the age of 18 must have their rights explained by the officer in a language appropriate to their age and level of understanding. Therefore, the officer must assess the accused youth's ability to understand their rights before attaining a statement from the youth. It is imperative that the officer states the rights to the youth in a manner that he or she fully understands due to the fact that the courts will not assess whether the child fully understood the rights inform to them by the officer but whether or not the officer explained their rights at a level appropriate to their age and understanding.\n\nOfficers employ such techniques as having the youth repeat or summarize in their own words the rights that were transmitted to them to avoid having any testimonies made by the accused youth waived by the courts.\n\nThe fundamental paradigm shift from the \"Youth Offenders Act\" to the \"Youth Criminal Justice Act\" involves the view that deviant youth are now viewed as offenders responsible for their actions. In a similar comparison to that of adults, the youth are encouraged to obtain legal counsel. The youth justice court or review board is required as a legal implication to advise the young person of their right to counsel. The following are some typical situations that warrant such advice: at a hearing for the youth when determining to detain or release the individual, at a youth's trial, and in situations where the custody of the youth is in question such as conditional supervision and decision reviews. The youth justice court or review board is more specifically required to provide a reasonable opportunity to obtain such counsel and this act is viewed as a mandated judicial measure. A specific difference in comparison to adult courts is the fact that it prohibits criminal proceedings against a youth without the consent of the Attorney General. In terms of adult proceedings, it is possible for members of the public to commence proceedings without the authorization of police and the Crown Attorney; however, that is not the case with youth. While comparing the \"Youth Offenders Act\" to the \"Youth Criminal Justice Act\", the former focuses more on a youth's choice to retain counsel and the role of lawyers in the criminal justice system. In terms of the JDA, more focus was placed on a youth being viewed as a misguided individual who required guidance from the courts.\n\nUnder the \"Act\", in case of the arrest or detention of a young person, the officer in charge must give notice to a parent either orally or in writing as soon as they possibly can under section 26(1). The notice must include under section 26(6) the following information: (a) the name of the young person (b) the charge against the young person and (c) a statement that the young person has the right to be represented by counsel. In addition, if summons, appearance of notice or promise to appear is issued in respect of a young person, the parent must be given notice in writing in person or via mail under section 26(2). Both sections 26(1) and 26(2) are subject to subsection 26(4), which states that if the whereabouts of the parents of the young person are not available, notice may be given to an adult who the person giving the notice considers appropriate. If there is a failure to give notice to a parent upon the arrest of a young person all proceedings continue and are not considered invalid under this act.\n\nYouths may be arrested by the police for more serious offences. The rights expressed in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms apply to youths and adults.\n\nYouths and adults have the right to obtain immediate legal counsel of their own choice upon arrest or detention. The Youth offender also has the right to have their parent(s) or guardian(s) present during questioning. Upon arrest or detainment, these rights must be explained in clear and understandable language.\n\nIf the police have violated the above rights, the charges may be dismissed by a judge or any statements made to the police may be ruled inadmissible by the judge in court.\n\nPresumptive offences were found to be unconstitutional and are no longer included in the \"Act\". A presumptive offence is an offence committed or alleged to have been committed by a young person who has attained the age of fourteen years. An adult sentence can be imposed on a young person who is found guilty of an offence for which an adult can be sentenced to imprisonment for more than two years if the offence was committed after a young person is fourteen years of age. \nPresumptive offence may be used under one of the following charges: first-degree or second-degree murder, attempt to commit murder, manslaughter or aggravated sexual assault. Other serious offences can fall within presumptive offence if it is the third conviction for such an offence. \nThe media is allowed to identify the youth who receives a sentence for a presumptive offence. The Judge will decide to identify the young person if a) There is reason to believe the young person is a danger to others. b) Publication of the information is necessary to assist in apprehending the young person. \nThe age of fourteen may sometimes be raised in a province where the Lieutenant Governor in council has fixed the age greater than fourteen.\nYouths who are 12 or 13 at the time of the offense may be sentenced in the same way, only for the following: first degree or second degree murder or manslaughter.\n\nA young person at trial has the right to instruct counsel without delay, where the right to counsel is usually imposed by a young person instead of a parent. Sections 25(4) and (10) allow young people to obtain the same rights as adults, in terms of legal counsel, consent, etc. It is also necessary that young persons be given the right to consult a parent or other adult in some circumstances.\n\nSubsection 25(10) of the \"Act\" permits provinces to establish a program for the recovery of costs of a young person's counsel from the young person or the parents of that young person. Therefore, young people are represented by permanent salaried legal aid lawyers or, as per the specified choice, by a private lawyer who accepts the legal aid mandate payable according to the pre-established rates. If a young offender is ineligible he is represented by a private lawyer at a cost agreed upon by the youth and/or his parents and the lawyer.\n\nTrials for both adults and youths follow the same rules for evidence and are equally formal. \n\nSection 110 of the \"Act\" outlines privacy in relation to the identity of young offenders, access to their criminal records, and disclosure of their personal or trial information.\n\nThe \"Act\" trial information can be published in media or print but identifying information (i.e., name) about young offenders cannot. This publication ban exists to prevent stigmatization of young offenders, which has been found to hinder the rehabilitation of youth. Furthermore, the identity of youth victims cannot be published for the same reasons. \nBreaking the publication ban is a criminal offence. It is unknown whether publication of identifying information on social networking sites like Facebook is a violation of the ban, which has been the source of recent controversy.\n\nThe ban can be lifted only under exceptional circumstances: \n\nYouth criminal records cannot be viewed by anyone other than criminal justice officials (e.g. lawyers) and only within particular time frames from the offence.\n\nDisclosure (\"the communication of information other than by way of publication\" of youth information is banned under the \"Act\". Communicating information about youth offenders through disclosure is a criminal offence\n\nThe \"Act\" allows the public and media to attend the trials of the youths and proceedings may be reported, but the identity of the youth can only be disclosed under special circumstances. The names of 15- to 17-year-olds who are convicted of serious, violent crimes, such as murder or aggravated sexual assault, can be reported in the media. If the youth is considered to be dangerous, their picture can be published in the media along with their name. Their name may also be revealed if they are still \"at large\" (have not been arrested yet) for the benefit of the public's safety when the expectation is that they will be charged once police have tracked them down.\n\nOn January 1, 2008, the \"Act\"'s Privacy clause was tested when several users of the Internet social networking site Facebook posted the identities of murdered Toronto teenager Stefanie Rengel and her killers (Melissa Todorovic and David Bagshaw) in defiance of both the publication ban and the fact that the police had not yet received the consent of Rengel's family to release her name to the media. While police and Facebook staff attempted to comply with the privacy regulations by deleting such posts, they noted that it was difficult to effectively police the individual users who repeatedly republished the deleted information.\n\nUnder the \"Act\", prior to conviction, detention is prohibited and deemed unnecessary. One of the new provisions of the \"Act\" is to limit the use of pre-trial detention and to promote alternatives to incarceration. Under the \"Youth Offenders Act\", pre-trial detention was on the rise and Canada, out of the western countries, had one of the highest youth incarceration rates. Not only was the use of pre-trial detention high, it also varied widely across the provinces. Pre-trial detention is not meant to be punitive, but research found negative outcomes associated with it as well, such as depravity of freedom and seclusion from the outside world. Many youth in custody prior to their sentencing were also found guilty more often than youths not in custody. The inconsistent use of pre-trial detention and negative connotations were cause enough for revision.\n\nThe fundamental purpose in the sentencing of young persons pursuant to the \"Act\" is to strike the best possible balance between the interests of the young person and the interests of society. The sentencing judge will also endeavour to impose a sentence that encourages the youth to take responsibility for the consequences of their actions.[s.3, s.38 YCJA]\n\nIn cases of very serious crime such as murder, the \"Act\" makes provision for the imposition of an adult sentence upon the youthful offender. In such cases the onus to establish that the young person should be sentenced as an adult is on the prosecution, by virtue of the 2008 Supreme Court of Canada decision \"R v DB\".[2008 SCC 25]\n\nCanadian appellate courts and the Supreme Court of Canada have repeatedly affirmed the principle that young persons convicted of crimes must be sentenced differently from adults. A notable example is the Ontario decision of \"R v D.T\". '2006 OJ 112' (Citation is wrong) where the Court asserted that a separate youth sentencing process is fundamental to Canadian societal notions of justice.\n\nIn \"R v C.D. / C.D.K\"[2005 SCC 78], the Supreme Court of Canada confirmed that youths will receive the most favourable interpretation available of the \"Act\"'s sentencing provisions . In \"C.D / C.D.K.\", the Court ruled that 'violent crime' as defined in s.39 of the \"Act\" did not include arson; the offender was thereby entitled to a more lenient disposition.[ibid, 85]\n\nSince the enactment of the \"Act\" in 2003, a greater number of young persons charged with criminal offences have received the benefit of \"diversion\" that was the practice under the former \"Young Offenders Act\".[Bala (2007), 7]. Diversion refers to the broad range of non-criminal sanctions, including community service that if satisfactorily completed by the youth, the subject charge is withdrawn.\n\nSection 39 (1) of the \"Act\" maintains that a custodial sentence should not be imposed on young offenders unless certain mandatory conditions outlined in the section are satisfied. The purpose of this section is to provide specific guidance to judges who are considering imposing a custodial sentence with the principal focus of reducing Canada's \"over-reliance on the incarceration of non-violent young persons\". Section 39 (1) (a) specifically places restrictions on the use of custodial sentences for non-violence offences unless the offender has a history of failing to comply with noncustodial sentences, has an extensive pattern of non-violent offending, or other exceptional circumstances. In addition to satisfying at least one of the conditions of section 39(1), the courts must also ensure the balance of section 39 when considering a custodial sentence of a non-violent offence. Also, the judges must take into account any rehabilitative concerns that would alter the nature and reduce the severity of the sentence by mitigating factors. For an example, courts must be certain to not impose a severe sentence in situations of rehabilitative of child welfare concerns. For an example, a custodial sentence should not be imposed to achieve rehabilitation purposes or to tackle such social circumstances such as lack of housing or an abusive home environment.\n\nSection 39 of the \"Act\" restricts the use of custodial sentences for young persons<ref name=\"Youth Court Statistics, 2003/04\">Statcan.gc.ca, Thomas, Jennifer. Statistics Canada: Catalogue no. 85-002-XPE, Vol. 25(4): 7. Retrieved July 26, 2009.</ref> This means that the young person should not be taken into custody unless the young person or their offence meet certain criteria. Subsection (1) (d) defines one of these criteria and states that custodial sentences may be used in those exceptional cases where the youth has committed an indictable offense. Further, the nature of the indictable offense must be such that imposing a non-custodial sentence would not fulfil the purpose and principles of sentencing as outlined in section 38 of the \"Act\". Section 38 of the \"Act\" states that the young person is to be held accountable for their actions and rehabilitated into society. Thus, as defined in 39 (1) (d), custodial sentences and imprisonment and to be used only in response to offences that are indictable and when non-custodial sentences are inappropriate with regards to the circumstances and the nature of the offence.\n\n39.(2) \"If any of 39(1)(a) to (c) apply, a youth justice court shall not impose a custodial sentence under section 42 unless the court has considered all alternatives to custody raised at the sentencing hearing that are reasonable in the circumstances, and determined that there is not a reasonable alternative, or combination of alternatives, that is in accordance with the purpose and principles set out in section 38.\n39.(3) \"In determining whether there is a reasonable alternative to custody, a youth justice court shall consider submissions relating to:\n\n(a) the alternatives to custody that are available;\n\n(b) the likelihood that the young person will comply with a non-custodial sentence, taking into account their compliance with previous non-custodial sentences; and\n\n(c) the alternatives to custody that have been used in respect of young persons for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.\n\nThe above entails that even though a 'serious offence' was committed by a youth, it does not automatically equate to time in custody. The presiding official in a youth justice court must review all options other than custody by utilizing the factors outlined in 39 (3). Specifically section 39 (2) prohibits the court from imposing custody unless all alternatives have been considered. The reason for said sections within the \"Act\" is to reduce the use of custody as a sentencing option, and consequently the number of youth in custody, and to ensure that the most intrusive response to youth offending is only used in serious cases. The inclusion of these sections displays a stark difference between the \"Young Offenders Act\" and the \"Youth Criminal Justice Act\" as the former did not have such clear preconditions that had to be satisfied prior to the imposition of a custodial sentence and thus large numbers of youth were incarcerated under the \"Young Offenders Act\".\n\nReports for sentencing hearings are used in more serious cases in order to assist in determining an appropriate sentence. The most frequently used report for sentencing hearings is the pre-sentence report which is outlined in section 40. The judge ultimately decides whether a report is necessary, though the crown may request the report and the defence counsel may argue against the issuing of a pre-sentence report. All custodial sentences require a pre-sentencing report. A pre-sentencing report is conducted by a government employee who interviews the youth and any significant influences including family members, peers and other important persons who may contribute to their report. This report is a historical outline which may include information regarding the youth's family background, school history, attitude toward their offence, willingness to engage in available community services, interview with the victim and potentially a suggestive sentence. The pre-sentence report is given to the judge, prosecutor and defence lawyers as well as the youth and any involved parent or guardian before the sentencing hearing.\n\nThe \"Act\" requires that the personal circumstances of the young person be considered before ordering a sentence. Custodial sentences are reserved for very serious offences (e.g., murder, manslaughter). The \"Act\" favours noncustodial sentencing options whenever possible in order to reduce the youth incarceration rates.\n\nRestitution of property is a noncustodial sentencing option. According to this sentence, the young person is ordered to make restitution—that is, pay back the equivalent amount of the property obtained by the young person to the lawful owner of the property. The youth justice court can fix the time and term of payment.\n\nOther considerations during this sentence include:\n\nUnder sentencing principle (3) (a) of the \"Act\", the sentencing of a youth's punishment should not by any means be harsher or surpass that of the punishment for an adult who has been found guilty of committing the same crime as the youth The reason for this sentencing principle was to eliminate discrepancies that were prevalent in the \"Young Offenders Act\". It was formed on the basis that youth under the Young Offenders Act were receiving longer sentences than adults for the same offences. In R. v. C.D.; [2005] a youth plead guilty to arson, breach of a recognisance, and the possession of a weapon. He received a light sentence of six months of deferred custody due to the Youth Criminal Justice Act. Appeals against this case, state that the youth has committed an indictable offence for which an adult would be imprisoned for a period of two or more years.\n\nUnder the sentencing principle 38 (2)(b)of the \"Young Criminal Justice Act\", the court requires that the sentence imposed must be similar in the region when young offenders are found guilty of the same crime under similar circumstances. This means that there should be a general level of consistency in sentences for young offenders who are guilty of the same crime. This principle addresses the unfair disparity of youth sentences, by stating that sentence should be similar, not necessarily the same Allowing such individualization makes the sentence meaningful for the youth involved and points at any rehabilitative needs required by the young offender. These sentencing principles are meant to be imposed in accordance to additional principles listed out in section 38 (3) which state that in determining the youth sentence, the court shall take in account: the degree of participation of subjected youth in offence, the degree of harm inflicted and intentions of offender, any reparations provided to victim or community by youth offender, any time spent in detention by youth due to offense, any other case of guilt found against the offender, and whether there is any additional aggravating or mitigating information against the offender that might influence the sentence read otherwise.\n\nThe sentencing principle 38 (2)(c)under the \"Act\" states 'the sentence must be proportionate to the seriousness of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the young person for that offence' Sentencing principles clearly explain the basis that establish fair and justifiable sentences. Under the Youth Criminal Justice Act punishments are not only limited to jail imprisonment in addition extrajudicial measures are taken such as community services and probation. The punishment is given to the offender according to the gravity of his/her offence. For young offenders, cases are viewed individually and sentencing is determined distinctively for different cases. Thus the more serious the offence is the more severe the punishment will be. Proportionality here means the size or the degree of the offence, thus the punishment should be proportional to the crime committed. So a young offender who commits murder will be will severely punished compared to someone who steals. How serious was the offence, the offender's level of participation and their intention, the harm done to the victim and the previous findings of the guilt are taken in account by the court to determine the sentencing of the offence.\n\nUnder the sentencing principle 38 2(d), the court is required to consider a substitute for the custody of young persons, while paying special attention to aboriginal offenders. In addition, the section also states that special concern should be given to youth by taking into account the gender, racial, and cultural differences. By responding to the needs of young aboriginal offenders, the focus of this section directs the court to use less harsh custodial sentences except when the offender poses a great threat to the public. \"Special attention to the circumstances of Aboriginal offenders is mandated by the-minute amendments to the YCJA initiated by the Senate\". An example of this is seen in R. V. D.R.D. (2006), in which a fourteen-year-old boy was pleaded guilty of trafficking and was appealing his sentence for drug charges. He was convicted to one year probation because the judge maintained that he is an extreme aboriginal youth which is a risk to the society.\n\nSentencing Option 42 (2) (a)\nSentencing option 42(2) under the \"Act\" is to reprimand the young person. Reprimand is a severe reproof or rebuke in this case by a person of authority.\nSentencing Option 42 (2)(b)\nWhen a young person is found guilty, through a youth justice court, the judge may refer to section 42(2)(b) under the \"Act\". Under section 42(2)(b) a young person, when guilt is found, may be discharged absolutely. This discharge is dependent on the best interest of the young offender without being in contrast with the best interests of the public. An absolute discharge, under section 42(2)(b), in accordance with 82(2), constitutes a termination of the sentence of a young person in respect of an offence in which a young person is found guilty. As opposed to conditional discharges, absolute discharges do not carry sanctions of probation or any other condition that the court may find appropriate (fair sanctions with meaningful consequences)\n\nSentencing Option 42 (2)(c)\nSentencing option 42 (2) c under the \"Act\" states that a convicted young offender can be discharged on any conditions the court decides to be appropriate. This may require the young offender to report to and be supervised by the provincial director. Conditions for a discharge might also include undergoing counselling, doing community service work or donation to a charity. Once the duration of the discharge has passed and the conditions of the probation have been successfully followed, the discharge becomes absolute, i.e., the youth will not be viewed as the offender although the record can be used for three years after finding of guilt in the event that there is a subsequent conviction. However, if the young person fails to abide by the conditions of probation, the offender can be convicted of the original offence and be sentenced.\n\nSentencing Options 42(2)(c)\nIf a young person is found guilty, \"By order direct that the young person be discharged on any conditions that the court considers appropriate and may require the young person to report to and be supervised by the provincial director\". As an order under conditional release, the young offender is required to follow certain rules set out by a probation order for a specific length of time; when the time duration has passed, the release becomes absolute. The considerations for conditional discharge must be in the best interest of the offender and not contrary to public interest. The purpose of this section is to reduce the rate of incarceration of young people and promote rehabilitation and reintegration into society. If any condition is violated by the young offender, they will be required to appear in front of the court again at which point they may be incarcerated. Examples of conditions placed on the young offender are as follows: \n\nSentencing Options 42(2)(d)\nIf a young person is found guilty of an offence in a youth justice court, the judge may impose a sentence under section 42 of the \"Act\". The purpose of sentencing under the \"Act\" \"is to hold a young person accountable for an offence by imposing fair sanctions with meaningful consequences.\" Under section 42(2)(d) it states that a young offender may not have a fine against them exceeding $1000 to be paid at the time and on the terms that the court may fix. This entails that the courts must have regard to the means of how the young offender will pay, as well as the ability for the young offender to be granted more time to complete the sentence. The offender then has the following options, he or she may be ordered to pay a victim fine surcharge (up to 15%) which contributes to assisting the victims of the crime. Or, the province may establish a program under which the young offender can discharge a fine under para, the percentage imposed under s53(1) or Victim fine surcharge under s 53(2) which is only attainable by earning credits for work in the program of the province the young offender resides.\n\nSentencing Options 42 (2)(e)\nSection 42(2)(e) under the \"Act\" states that the young person must pay to the other person at the time/terms that the court fixes the amount of compensation due to loss of income/support, damage of property etc.\n\nSentencing Options 42(2)(h)\nSection 42 (2) (h) under the \"Act\" is a non- custodial sentencing option that states that the Youth Justice Court (YJC) may order a young offender to compensate the victim in kind or by personal service for a damage, loss, or injury suffered. Under 42 (2) (h), an order may be made under section 42 (2) (g) where the young offender is to monetarily compensate the purchaser of a stolen property since the stolen property had to be returned to the owner, or section 42 (2) (e) where the young offender is to monetarily compensate the victim for personal injury or property that was damaged. The YJC may arrange the times and terms of compensation that is ordered. However, the compensation must not conflict with the young offender's regular schedule of education and work. The order to provide personal service to the victim can be assigned for any number of hours but is limited up to 240 hours. The hours of service ordered can be completed within one year from the date which the sentencing option was ordered; however the YJC may allow an extension of time to fully complete the sentence, on application of the young offender. Although the YJC may order the young offender to compensate the victim by providing personal service, the consent of the compensated is required.\n\nSentencing Options 42(2)(i)\nIn the \"Act\", under Sentencing options 42 (2) (i), the court has the option to order a young person to complete community service for a punishment. The amount of community service must not go beyond 240 hours of service which can be completed within 12 months. The community service must be approved by the provincial director of the youth justice court or a person designated by the youth justice court. The purpose of sentencing under section 42 is to protect society by holding the young person accountable for their actions by giving the right amount of punishment which can promote their rehabilitation and reintegration into society.\nThis type of sentencing is a non custodial sentencing option which is the goal of the Youth Criminal Justice act to not rely on the over use of incarceration for non violent youths. It also gives out different options which can be costumed to different individual cases that can give out the best solution possible. These are the innovations that were created due to the Youth Criminal Justice Act, it helps youth to get the best rehabilitation to continue on their lives in society.\n\nSentencing Options 42(2)(k)\nSection 42(2)(k) under the \"Act\" allows a young person to be placed on Probation (as specified by conditions and other matters related to probation orders under sections 55 and 56) for a specified period of time not exceeding two years. Orders may range from being supervised by the provincial director; remain within the territorial jurisdiction of one or more courts; attending school; or having to reside at a place specified by the provincial director. The Youth Justice Court prescribes these conditions as an order so the young person will learn to be of good behaviour and appear before the youth justice court when required to do so.\n\nProbation is the sentence most frequently imposed by youth justice courts in Canada, as the conditions laid out are directly related to the young offenders criminal behaviour. This helps the offender to see the harm caused by their actions to the society and victims, and why they should not commit such crimes again. If a young offender fails to comply with the probation order, they can possibly be charged with breach of probation. But th \"Act\" does not require the charges be laid; rather, it states that an alternative approach is recommended. Such as a review of probation orders thus providing an opportunity to make changes to conditions that can be more effective in promoting the rehabilitation and reintegration of the young person.\n\nSentencing Options 42 (2) (l)\nTo ensure that a young offenders illegal actions are followed by consequences that are \"(1)just; (2)have meaningful consequences for the youth; (3) and promote the rehabilitation and reintegration of the youth into society\" the \"Act\" has instilled several sentencing options.\n\nAccording to Section 42(2), the twelfth sentencing option for youth is the placement in an (l) intensive support and supervision program. This non-custodial sentencing option was introduce to the act along with options such as reprimand as well as non-residential programs or attendance orders.\n\nThis sentencing option is meant to be an alternative for custody, and was implemented to decrease high rates of custody caused by the \"Young Offenders Act\". The young offender receives support and supervision from their community in hopes that they will alter their behaviour. The intent of this sentencing option is to provide more support than probation and is often used to promote the use of community-based and rehabilitation sentences.\n\nThis option encourages the rehabilitation of the youth and should target the specific needs or problems that seem to have contributed to their illegal behaviour.\n\nThis sentencing option will only take place if the government has established programs and the courts have received approval of the provincial director. If not available, a probation order will be used along with various conditions to ensure the support and supervision of the youth in question.\n\nSentencing Options 42 (2) (m)\n\nThis new sentencing option requires, at specific times, a young offender to attend court sanctioned programs. Over a six-month period a maximum of 240 hours that can be assigned.\n\nThis sentencing option is a nonresidential program that may be used as an alternative to custody and may be focused at specific high-risk times of day, such as when the youth may be unattended and unsupervised.\n\nA Pilot attendance centre program in Ontario has reported considerable success and was well received by Ontario youth court judges.\n\nThis measure may only occur if and attendance order program is available in the province. Provinces may decide not to implement this provision of the \"Act\" and are not required to make this option available.\n\nDue to potential high costs associated with this program, provinces may be eligible for additional federal funding.\n\nIn the absence of such programs, a youth court judge may achieve similar ends by attaching specific conditions to a probation order handed down to a young person. The judge may also (as a condition of probation) require the young person to attend community programs.\n\nThe overall goal of attendance programs is to supervise young persons at times when they may be more prone to commit crimes, such as when left unattended by parents.\n\nSentencing Options 42(2)(n)\nThe \"Act\" states that all custodial sentences must have a mandatory period of supervision in the community. The rationale behind the community supervision order is to provide support and supervision for the young offender's transition from custody back into their community.\n\nWhen a judge sentences a young offender to a custody and supervision order under Section 42(2) (n) of the \"Act\", it means that the young offender must serve time in custody, followed by a period of supervision in the community. The supervision order may be up to half as long as the custodial period. This sentencing option is for convicted youth criminals who are convicted for crimes other than murder, attempted murder, manslaughter, aggravated sexual assault or who are in custody as a result of an IRCS (Intensive Rehabilitative Custody and Supervision) order.\n\nThe length of the custodial sentence and supervision order combined must not exceed two or three years, depending on the type of offence. Offences other than for which an adult would receive life imprisonment are subject to a two-year maximum for the young offender. Offences for which an adult would receive life imprisonment, except murder, are subject to a three-year maximum for the young offender.\n\nIf a condition laid out by the judge or other officials is broken, or not met appropriately while under supervision in the community, reviews are held which determine whether the young offender's conditions should be changed or if he or she should be sent back into custody.\n\nSentencing Options 42(2)(o)\nSection 42(2)(o) of the \"Act\" establishes the length of time to be served in custody or in community supervision for cases of attempted murder, manslaughter, aggravated sexual assault. The total serving time for these periods cannot exceed 3 years since life imprisonment is imposed on adults responsible for these offences. Under the \"Act\", murder is the only offence that must result in a custody and supervision order. The maximum serving time is 10 years for first-degree murder and 7 years for second-degree murder.\n\nSection 42(2) (o) also asserts the ability of the court to decide the duration of conditional supervision. Thus the supervision period does not have to be half the period of custody. This condition provides more liberty for the courts to respond with an appropriate sentence to serious offences. If a young person violates a condition during the supervision period, the provincial director may place the offender back into custody.\n\nFor other statutory considerations, the supervision part of the order includes mandatory and discretionary conditions (s. 105). Also, the amount of time served in custody by a young person can be extended via AG or provincial director's request to the YJC. However, the added duration of custody may not surpass the remainder of the youth sentence (s. 104).\n\nSentencing Options 42(2)(p)\nUnder section 42(2)(p) of the \"Act\", a judge may impose a deferred custody and supervision order as a sentencing option. A deferred custody and supervision order means that the young offender will not go into custody but will serve their sentence under supervision in the community with a set of strict conditions. If these conditions are not followed, then the conditions may be changed and the young person may be ordered to serve the balance of the sentence in custody. \nThe order will be made if the offense committed is not a serious, violent one such as murder or aggravated assault, and if the young person has not committed an indictable offence that an adult would be imprisoned for, for more than two years. The order will be for six months or less and must be considered a just sanction that has meaningful consequences and will promote the young offender's rehabilitation and reintegration into society and contribute to the long-term protection of the public. \nThe order will include both strict mandatory and optional conditions that the judge deems appropriate and which fall under subsection 105(2) and 105(3). These conditions will include reporting to the provincial director, attending school and/or working, not possessing weapons, abiding by curfews, reporting information changes and others.\n\nSentencing Options 42(2)(q)\nThe \"Act\" section 42 (2) (q) outlines the following pertaining to custody and supervision for 1st and 2nd degree murder Offenders found guilty of 1st degree murder will get a maximum sentence of 10 years, including a maximum custody period of 6 years and a period of conditional supervision in the community. Offenders found guilty of 2nd Degree Murder will get a 7-year maximum sentence including a maximum custody period of 4 years and a period of conditional supervision in the community. Other statutory considerations are that the Attorney General or a provincial director may apply to extend the length of time the young person will spend in custody. The extension may not exceed the remainder of the youth sentence. At least one month prior to the expiration of the custodial portion of the sentence, the YJC sets conditions of the young person's conditional supervision\n\nThe aforementioned sentences are not guaranteed as the Crown could recommend a harsher adult sentence if the offence meets certain requirements Adult Sentence) When the \"Act\" was introduced the aspect that was publicized was \"to respond more firmly and effectively to the small number of the most serious, violent young offenders\" because the public was losing confidence in the youth justice system This was the reason for the harsh penalties for first- and second- degree murder, however, overall, the \"Act\" has decreased the number of youths within jails for non-violent offences substantially.\n\nSentencing Options 42(2)(r).\nThis section provides that a judge may issue an intensive rehabilitative custody and supervision order. This sentence is intended to provide treatment for serious violent offenders. The court may only issue this order if any of the following criteria are met:\n\nThis section applies to young people ages twelve to seventeen as long as one or more of these conditions are met. The Youth Justice Court must specify the time period the order is applicable for. The maximum period for an intensive rehabilitative custody and supervision order is 2 years, unless the adult penalty for the offence is imprisonment for life, in those cases the maximum period is 3 years. The only other exceptions occur in the case of:\n\n\nSection 55 (2) (g)\nWhen the youth is sentenced to probation he or she is subject to certain conditions that may be imposed by the judge Under Section 55 (2) (g) the young offender may be told to \"reside at a place that the provincial director may specify\" This condition follows 2 other requirements that the young offender also needs to obey by a) keep the peace and be of good behaviour; and b) appear by the youth justice court when required by the court to do so this stated in Section 55 (1). The probation conditions follow those stipulated under section 42(2)(k) or (l). This means the director has the power to indicate where they want you to live, moving you from one area to the next depending on the circumstances surrounding the young offender's situation.\n\nSection 59: Review of Non-Custodial Youth Sentences\nUnder the \"Young Offender's Act\", approximately 20% of custody sentences were charged based on \"failure to comply\" issues surrounding probation orders The \"Youth Criminal Justice Act\" revised these procedures recognizing that most issues concerning the violation of probation conditions were not criminal acts themselves and that in doing so, were compromising the integrity of the justice system itself. Therefore, the \"Act\" considers a review, rather than a charge, as a means of reducing the reliance on incarceration while being as fair as possible to the offender in assessing the seriousness of an offence\n\nThe \"Act\" reveals that a review, \"can be issued at any time after six months of the initial youth sentence or, with leave of a youth justice court judge\" (56). Also, reviews, in most cases, are exempt from those offenders who are charge with an offence outlined in section 42 of the \"Act\". The full grounds for review are revealed under section 59.2 and are as follows:\n\n\nIf a young person is found guilty of an indictable offence, an offence where an adult would be liable to receive more than two years, an order for an adult sentence shall be imposed on a young offender in the following cases:\n\nThere are three categories of offences that may attract an adult sentence:\nThere are a few important changes to \"Act\" compared to the \"Young Offenders Act\", for example, the transfer process from a youth court to an adult court is eliminated. Instead, the youth court first determines whether or not the young person is guilty of the offence, and then, under certain circumstances, the youth court may impose an adult sentence,\n\nWhen the Crown does not seek an adult sentence for presumptive offence\nSection 65 of the \"Act\" states that if the Attorney General gives notice to the court at any stage of the proceedings that the young offender, who is alleged to have committed a \"presumptive offence\" (as mentioned above) that an adult sentence would not be sought, the court shall order that the young individual is not liable to an adult sentence; the youth would immediately be tried in youth court and a youth sentence would be imposed.\n<br>Under this \"Act\", the publication ban would be in effect, in accordance with Section 110 which states that no one shall publish the name or any information related to the young person if it would identify the individual.\n<br>This act was posted in Bill C-3 under Clause 64.\n<br>This act applies in accordance to the seriousness and circumstances of the offence, and the age, maturity, character, background and previous record of the young person and any other factors considered relevant (Section 72). In addition, the age for presumptive offences was lowered to fourteen, causing a lot of doubts have been brought up to whether a fourteen-year-old should be treated in the same fashion as adults, especially when there are other pieces of criminal legislation (proposed and already in existence), recognizing their immature status.\n\nThe \"Act\" defines a \"serious violent offence\" as an offence in the commission of which a young person causes or attempts to cause serious bodily harm. A \"serious violent offence\" can become a presumptive offence if the young person has previously committed two violent offences. \"Presumptive offence\" means that the young person, over the age of 14, can receive an adult sentence if they are found guilty. If a young person is charged for a serious violent offence, they will be sentenced for \"intensive rehabilitative custody and supervision order\". It is an individualized treatment plan. \nThe court can make this order in specific circumstances:\n\n\nSection 137 of the \"Act\" outlines the definitions and consequences of failing to comply with a sentence or disposition, in other words, a breach of probation. It states that anyone failing to comply with their probation order is guilty of a punishable offence on a summary conviction. These orders can include failure to report to and be supervised by the provincial director when on probation, failure to perform community service plus many more stated in section 42(2) of the act. If a breach of probation occurs, the offender may be incarcerated provided it is not their first probation violation, with a sentence not exceeding two years, except in the cases of first-degree murder or second-degree murder.\n\nDifferences in breach of probation in the \"Youth Criminal Justice Act\" versus \"Youth Offenders Act\"\n\nThe \"Young Offenders Act\" raised concern that too many young people were being incarcerated for offences not directly harming the community, but for failure to comply with the terms of probation. The \"Act\" recognizes that youths have a hard time complying with limits to behaviour and are deserving of a second chance. Since the \"Act\" was enacted, the number of charges of probation violation has remained similar while the number of cases has declined.\n\n\n"}
