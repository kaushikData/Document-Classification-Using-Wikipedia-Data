{"id": "1158795", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1158795", "title": "2004 Arizona Proposition 200", "text": "2004 Arizona Proposition 200\n\nProposition 200, the \"Arizona Taxpayer and Citizen Protection Act,\" was an Arizona state initiative passed in 2004 that basically requires: (a) persons to provide proof of citizenship to register to vote; (b) voters to present a photo identification before receiving a ballot at the polling place; and (c) state and local agencies to verify the identity and eligibility, based on immigration status, of applicants for non-federally mandated public benefits. The proposition also makes it a misdemeanor for public officials to fail to report violations of U.S. immigration law by applicants for those public benefits and permits private lawsuits by any resident to enforce its provisions related to public benefits. The requirement to provide proof of citizenship to register to vote was later ruled invalid in federal court.\n\nAuthors of the ballot measure, the \"Protect Arizona Now\" committee, claimed that the provision of state identification and public benefits to individuals without adequately verifying their immigration status gave rise to opportunities for voter fraud and imposed economic hardship on the state.\n\nOpponents of the ballot measure asserted that it was anti-immigrant and reminiscent of California's 1994 Proposition 187, as well as disputed the existence of voter fraud and argued that immigrants were important contributors to the state's economy.\n\nTwo separate, rival groups supported Proposition 200. The first group was the proposition's sponsor, the Protect Arizona Now (PAN) committee, led by Kathy McKee and supported at the national level by the Carrying Capacity Network (CCN) and Population-Environment Balance (PEB). The second group was the Yes on 200 committee, led by Rusty Childress, a Phoenix-area car dealer, and supported at the national level by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR). There was a split within PAN, which McKee described as an \"attempted hijacking of a local effort by greedy, out-of-state interests\"; this split highlighted an ongoing feud within the immigration reduction movement between FAIR and the other two groups dating back to at least 2003, with CCN and PEB issuing frequent statements accusing FAIR (as well as NumbersUSA) of being \"reform lite\" and \"undermining real immigration reform.\"\n\nPAN was formed by McKee and Childress, who became its chair and treasurer, respectively. The PAN National Advisory Board was chaired by Dr. Virginia Abernethy, and included Dr. David Pimentel and Marvin Gregory. Childress later joined a separate effort, Yes On 200, organized by FAIR.\n\nDuring the signature gathering campaign, McKee accused Childress of withholding funds and petitions from PAN and fired him. Childress sued McKee over custody of PAN's signatures and funds, but the court ruled in favor of McKee. Childress and the two most prominent supporters of the initiative within the Arizona state legislature, Russell Pearce and Randy Graf, then formed a separate organization, Yes On 200, which was funded almost entirely by out-of-state interests.\n\nWhen FAIR began an independent signature gathering campaign to collect the remaining signatures needed to put the initiative on the ballot, McKee accused FAIR of attempting a hostile takeover of PAN. When McKee named Abernethy, an avowed \"ethnic separatist,\" as the chair of PAN's national advisory board, FAIR responded by issuing a press release calling for both McKee and Abernethy to resign from PAN and saying that Abernethy's views were \"repugnant, divisive and do not represent the views of the vast majority of Arizonans who support Proposition 200.\" Abernethy's appointment drew harsh criticism from an anti-bigotry group based in Chicago, which noted her \"leadership roles in other extremist organizations,\" such as The Occidental Quarterly and the Council of Conservative Citizens.\n\nOn July 5, 2004, Protect Arizona NOW's Chairman, Kathy McKee, pursuant to Arizona law, submitted 190,887 signatures to the Arizona Secretary of State's office, surprising critics, who had believed organizers would not be able to garner enough signatures before the deadline. A counter-organization, the Statue of Liberty Coalition, was formed to block Proposition 200, claiming the initiative was racist and would violate Latino civil rights. Opposition to Proposition 200 was bipartisan, including Senator John McCain (R), Senator Jon Kyl (R), Governor Janet Napolitano (D), the Arizona Republican Party, the Green Party, the Libertarian Party, and the AFL-CIO. Tamar Jacoby, a writer on immigration-related issues in articles for \"The Wall Street Journal\" and the \"Los Angeles Times\".\n\nSupporters partly relied for justification on a 2004 FAIR study that estimated that Arizona taxpayers were annually paying $1 billion to cover the education, uncompensated health care, and incarceration costs of illegal immigration, net of the taxes paid by the illegal immigrants. This study appeared to contradict a 2003 study performed by a team at the Thunderbird School of Global Management and sponsored by Wells Fargo and the Consul General of Mexico in Phoenix, which estimated that immigrants were annually contributing $318 million more in income and sales taxes than they were costing the state in services and uncompensated health care. However, it was not clear whether that estimate was based on all immigrants or only illegal immigrants.\n\nIn November 2004, the electorate passed Proposition 200, with 56% of voters voting in the affirmative. Exit polls found that 47% of Latino voters voted in favor of the initiative.\n\nA substantial legal battle erupted over the precise definition of \"public benefits.\" Arizona's Attorney General ruled that the law pertains to only discretionary state programs. Federally funded entitlements like food stamps and subsidized school lunches are examples of public benefits to which, given the Attorney General's finding, the new law would not apply. PAN interpreted the proposition to apply the welfare portion of the initiative to the nearly 60 programs contained in Arizona Revised Statutes Title 46, \"Welfare.\"\n\nDespite withstanding three pre-election and two post-election lawsuits, at least one lawsuit related to Proposition 200 is still pending. \"Yes on 200\" filed a post-election lawsuit, initially dismissed in the lower court but currently on appeal, saying that the Attorney General overstepped his bounds when he narrowed the definition of \"public benefits.\"\n\nOn December 23, 2004, the federal appeals court in Tucson, Arizona removed an earlier restraining order that had kept the state from implementing the law. The entire law, with one exception, is in effect, using the definition of \"public benefits\" promulgated by the Governor and Attorney General. State, county, and city workers may be fined up to $700 for each instance in which they provide such benefits to persons who cannot produce evidence of citizenship.\n\nKathy McKee has since started a new group, Protect America NOW, to support similar initiatives in other states.\n\nProposition 200 required, among other things, proof of citizenship to register to vote and voter identification at the polling place. No major elections took place after its adoption before November 7, 2006, and the actual implementation of these two provisions of the proposition remained unclear. Opponents challenged the constitutionality of these requirements upon voters, arguing that such a law could be used to discriminate against ethnic groups, thus violating the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nOn October 5, 2006, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit temporarily suspended these requirements, a little over a month before the election. However, the ruling was stayed fifteen days later by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nIn October 2010, the Ninth Circuit held that the requirement to provide proof of citizenship to register to vote is invalid as preempted by the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA) and that the requirement to provide voter identification at the polling place is valid. However, in April 2011, the court granted Arizona's petition for \"en banc\" review of this ruling, and it heard oral arguments on June 21, 2011.\n\nIn April 2012, the \"en banc\" court also held that the requirement to provide proof of citizenship to register to vote is invalid as preempted by the NVRA and that the requirement to provide voter identification at the polling place is valid. The Supreme Court of the United States declined to stay the ruling on June 28, 2012.\n\nIn July 2012, Arizona submitted to the Supreme Court a petition for writ of certiorari to review the Ninth Circuit's ruling that the state's proof of citizenship requirement is preempted by the NVRA. The Court granted the petition in October 2012, and it heard oral arguments on March 18, 2013. On June 17, 2013, the Supreme Court affirmed, in a 7-2 vote with Justice Antonin Scalia delivering the Court's opinion, the Ninth Circuit's ruling that Arizona's proof of citizenship requirement is preempted by the NVRA.\n\n"}

The museum focuses on topics of civil justice and \"aspects of the legal system that handle wrongful actions that result in injury\". The museum opened to the public in September 2015. It is the first law museum in the United States.\n\nThe museum offers displays regarding the evolution of tort law, precedent setting cases, and cases that made a difference.\nEisterhold Associates designed the museum's exhibits. That firm also lent its efforts to a number of museums across the nation, including the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis, Tennessee, and the Jurassic Park Discovery Center at Universal's Islands of Adventure in Orlando, Florida.\n\nOriginally announced in 1998, at an expected cost of $5million or $10million, Nader sought a way to turn abstract legal cases, on which he has spent significant time working, into interesting displays for the public. The museum planned to include exhibitions on some famous cases including McDonald's' scalding coffee, flammable pajamas, asbestos, breast implants, medical malpractice, the pollution of Love Canal, and a Ford Pinto with the exploding gas tank.\n\nThe museum's concept faced criticism from a number of sources, including questions on whether it would attract an audience outside of legal scholars and whether it would be anything more than Nader's tribute to himself. It was anticipated that the museum would open in late 2006 following eight years of planning and at a cost of more than $4million.\nBy 2006, Nader had raised more than half the funds necessary, despite some funders leaving the project, and the plans to use a former factory on Winsted’s Main Street had been approved by the town.\n\nIn 2013, it was reported that Ralph Nader had purchased the former Winsted Savings Bank building at . This building was approved by the Winsted Zoning Commission as the new site for the proposed museum. Building renovation and interior construction began in July 2014 and was completed in July 2015.\n\nIn June 2015, the museum hired Richard Newman as its first head. Newman is the co-author of the standard treatise on Connecticut Law of Torts and served as president of the Connecticut Trial Lawyers Association from 2004 to 2005.\n"}

The Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1900 had continued this process, empowering the government's Commissioners of Work and local County Councils to protect a wider range of properties. In 1908 a royal commission concluded that there were gaps between these two pieces of legislation, and the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1910. These were felt to be unwieldy, and the Ancient Monuments Act repealed all three in 1913, replacing them with the new Ancient Monuments Board to oversee the protection of such monuments. Powers were given for the Board, with Parliamentary approval, to issue preservation orders and to protect the lands immediately around an ancient monument.\n\nThe Ancient Monuments Act was passed in 1931 to deal with gaps in this system. In particular, the new act extended the definition of an ancient monument to include a cave or an underground archaeological artefact; it also extended the powers of the state to manage development in the area around an ancient monument, allowing them to introduce preservation schemes to protect the wider neighbourhood.\n\n"}
{"id": "331887", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=331887", "title": "Attacks on humanitarian workers", "text": "Attacks on humanitarian workers\n\nHumanitarian aid workers belonging to United Nations organisations, PVOs / NGOs or the Red Cross / Red Crescent have traditionally enjoyed both international legal protection, and \"de facto\" immunity from attack by belligerent parties. However, attacks on humanitarian workers have occasionally occurred, and became more frequent since the 1990s and 2000s. In 2012 there were 167 incidents of major violence against aid workers and in 2013 there were 474 attacks. This is attributed to a number of factors, including the increasing number of humanitarian workers deployed, the increasingly unstable environments in which they work, and the erosion of the perception of neutrality and independence. In 2012, road travel was seen to be most dangerous and kidnappings of aid workers have quadrupled in the decade with more aid workers victims of kidnapping than any other form of attack. ICRC promotes a framework for Neutral Independent Humanitarian Action (NIHA) to enable differentiated role understanding.\n\nThe legal basis for protection of humanitarian workers in armed conflicts is contained in the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the related Protocols I and II of 1977. These treaties describe the category of civilians and outline the rights and obligations of non-combatants during armed conflicts. These rights include the right to be treated humanely; to have access to food, water, shelter, medical treatment, and communications; to be free from violence to life and person, hostage taking, and humiliating or degrading treatment; and the prohibition against collective punishment or imprisonment. \"Non-combatants\" include citizens and nationals of countries that are not party to the conflict.\n\nWhile the Geneva Conventions guarantee protection for humanitarian workers, they do not guarantee access of humanitarian workers to affected areas: governments or occupying forces may, if they wish, ban a relief agency from working in their area. Médecins Sans Frontières was created in 1971 with the express purpose of ignoring this restriction, by providing assistance to populations affected by the Biafran civil war despite the prohibitions of the government of Nigeria.\n\nIn addition, the Geneva Conventions do not require that parties to the conflict guarantee the safety of humanitarian workers. The Conventions prohibit combatants from attacking non-combatants, and they require occupying forces to maintain general order. However, the Conventions do not require that combating parties provide security escorts, for example, when other factions threaten the safety of non-combatants operating in their area.\n\nIn 2003, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1502 giving greater protection to humanitarian workers and treating attacks on them as a war crime.\n\nThe method of targeting foreigners through suicide bombings, IEDs and kidnappings (often closely associated with criminal and political actors) are strong evidence of at least some political motivations against aid workers. It is very hard often to precisely ascertain a motive; for instance, in 55% of the incidents recorded by the AWSD in 2008, the motive was described as ‘undetermined’. However, of those that were determined, political motivations have increased (29% of the determined total in 2003 to 49% in 2008) relative to economic motivations, or when the victim’s status as an aid worker was only incidental. Afghanistan, as one of the most dangerous countries for humanitarian workers to operate in is influential in this changing dynamic; in 2007 61% of incidents were carried out by criminals and 39% by political opposition groups, but in 2008, 65% of incidents were the work of armed opposition groups.\n\nAid workers can be targeted for political reasons both directly and by association. Sometimes the humanitarian organisation may be targeted for something that it has done or a statement it has made, or simply for the delivery of aid to a population, to whom others do not wish aid to reach. It can also be targeted as a result of being associated as an entity collaborating with the 'enemy' (a government, rebel group or foreign power). The dangers of being associated with specific governments or armed forces has further increased the determination of aid workers to be seen as separate, independent and neutral politically. However, evidence shows that this has little impact and instead that western aid agencies are perceived as an intrinsic part of the western 'agenda' and not merely associated with it. In the case of Afghanistan, with the notable exception of the International Committee of the Red Cross, it has been surmised that locals no longer make distinctions (as they once did) between organisations, e.g. those were working with the coalition force’s Provincial Reconstruction Teams and those that did not. In remote areas, they sometimes represent the only accessible western target. Although empirical studies on aid worker insecurity have been scarce, two have been conducted in Afghanistan. Watts (2004) did not find evidence indicating heightened aid worker insecurity in provinces where the US military was present. Similarly, Mitchell (2015) was unable to discover a relationship between attacks against NGOs and their proximity to the US military or US-led PRTs respectively; however, his study did reveal that aid workers were more likely to encounter a greater number of security incidents in provinces with PRTs not led by the US.\n\n\nA full list of major incidents, from 1997–present, of violence against aid workers can be found at Humanitarian Outcomes' Aid Worker Security Database.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4718935", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4718935", "title": "BC Legislature Raids", "text": "BC Legislature Raids\n\nThe BC Legislature Raids (also known as Railgate after Watergate) resulted from search warrants executed on the Legislature of British Columbia, Canada, in 2003 and has become a collective term for the associated criminal proceedings and ensuant controversies. Hearings began in BC Supreme Court in April 2007. The proceedings brought to light questions concerning the propriety of the sale of BC Rail to CN Rail and the conduct of various government officials and consultants as well as the role of various members of the government, including Premier Gordon Campbell and his advisers. In October 2010, ministerial aides Dave Basi and Bob Virk pleaded guilty to breach of trust and receiving a benefit for leaking information about the BC Rail bidding process.\n\nAccording to the RCMP, the Raids arose from information uncovered during a drug sting. In 2003, the RCMP were monitoring Dave Basi's conversations on his home, government, and cellular phones, as well as his e-mails. At that time the police were focused on breaking up a marijuana and cocaine smuggling ring between British Columbia and Ontario run by his cousin Jasmohan Singh Bains.\n\nDuring the police investigation of Basi's activities investigators became interested in Basi's dealings as Ministerial Assistant to then Finance Minister Gary Farrell-Collins. A second investigation was launched that had no connection to drug related activities but rather to the sale of benefits in regard to the tendering process for the sale of BC Rail.\n\nOn December 28, 2003, a series of search warrants was executed at various locations throughout the Lower Mainland and in Victoria. There were four separate applications by the RCMP in 2004 to obtain warrants, and according to the CBC these were executed at nine separate premises including the Parliament Buildings in Victoria. As a result, allegations of bribery were made (including money and the offer of potential employment in return for confidential government information).\n\nThe sale of BC Rail involved a tax indemnity. This was structured so that if CN would not have been refunded $415 million from the Federal Government, then the Province would be required to return this amount to CN. This had the effect of reducing the sale price of BC Rail from $1.05 billion to under $500 million, thereby in essence short-changing taxpayers more than $550 million. (This is in addition to $750 million cash payments and $250 million in direct tax credits, as noted in the section on Patrick Kinsella below.) The BC Rail tax indemnity was taken off the Public Accounts in January 2005, before the May 2005 election, when it was reclassified a contingent liability.\n\nOn April 3, 2006, a Justice of the British Columbia Supreme Court ordered the further release of various documents used by police to obtain the search warrants served on individuals linked to the Raids.\n\nFurther charges were laid against two Victoria area developers.\n\nBasi has also been charged for accepting $50,000 in connection with the Agricultural Land Commission.\n\nSeveral of the people cited by online commentators or certain reporters in the story surrounding the raid are politically active people who had come into contact with Basi. Examples include provincial ministers, staff or officials in the Liberal Party of Canada or the Paul Martin leadership campaign.\n\nSearch warrants were executed at several locations in addition to the BC Legislature. The Vancouver home office of Erik Bornmann, the Vancouver home of Bruce Clark (brother of Christy Clark, CKNW 980 talk show host), and the offices of Pilothouse public affairs in Victoria in December 2003. It has been reported that Erik Bornmann, Brian Kieran and Jamie Elmhirst will testify for the Crown. The RCMP also attended Ms. Clark's home that she shared with her ex-husband Mark Marissen.\n\nThe RCMP made it very clear that no elected officials were implicated in their investigation, and also provided a letter to Marissen (Paul Martin's BC Campaign Chair) confirming that he was also not implicated in any way and that they came to his house without a search warrant to seek his help because they thought he might be the \"innocent recipient\" of emails related to Virk's and Basi's resumes, because it was alleged that they were seeking job recommendations for federal political employment in Ottawa. Basi was an active volunteer for the Paul Martin campaign in British Columbia, who recruited many members of the Indo-Canadian community to the Liberal Party to vote in the leadership process. This has led to rampant speculation and innuendo as government critics attempt to link Basi's activities to federal and provincial politicians and operatives, and spread \"guilt by association\". Part of this speculation is fuelled by comments made to the media at the time of the raids by the officer in charge, that organized crime and corruption were present in \"the highest levels of the government\".\n\nIn December 2004 three men were charged in connection with this investigation and in 2006 two more men were charged.\n\nThose charged include:\n\nComplications in the case included controversy as to whether the police may have misled a judge in the course of obtaining warrants for the investigation which involved eavesdropping on conversations between the Premier and the Finance Minister. Twice the warrants were rejected on grounds of privilege, with the third warrant issued without naming the premises, which were the Legislature Buildings.\n\nThe preliminary hearings into eventual criminal court proceedings were kept sealed from the public until opened up in the public's interest, and by requests from defence council, in the fall of 2008 by the presiding justice, Elizabeth Bennett, who struck down the court ban in the grounds of the importance of an open court in regard to the importance of the case to the public interest, contrary to the objections of the government-appointed Special Prosecutor. On February 25, 2009, Judge Bennett released 8000 pages of documents relating to the legislature raids to the New Democrat Official Opposition.\n\nThe documents produced attention immediately, first to what appeared to be B.C. Liberal Party fundraising activities originating from the Finance Minister's office, then to the B.C. Liberal government's strategy for dominating the media discourse and neutralizing question period.\n\nOn March 6, 2009, after raising these two stories the B.C. New Democratic Party caucus released the documents to the public through their website.\n\nShortly after the B.C. New Democratic Caucus won access to the 8000 pages of B.C. rail documents, their researchers uncovered a link between long-time B.C. Liberal Party insider Patrick Kinsella and B.C. Rail while looking through public documents available at the legislative library. The documents showed that between 2002 and 2004, B.C. Rail paid $297,000 to the group of companies owned by Kinsella.\n\nThe discovered documents were first aired in question period on Tuesday, March 10, 2009. When questioned by New Democratic Party justice critic, Leonard Krog, about what Kinsella was paid by B.C. Rail to do, the Attorney General, Wally Oppal, claimed that \"the issue relating to B.C. Rail is before the Supreme Court of British Columbia, and we will not comment on the matter.\" \n\nKinsella's company, the Progressive Group, issued a statement claiming that Kinsella \"was engaged by BC Rail to assist in understanding and interpreting the Core Review Process as to its potential impact on the Corporation\", while on B.C. Rail's payroll.\n\nQuestioned outside of the legislature Oppal said that he had no idea if Kinsella's activities were connected to the B.C. Rail trial.\nSoon after, a defence lawyer involved in the trial alleged that Kinsella was working for both CN Rail and BC Rail in the time before the $1-billion sale of BC Rail to CN was finalized.\n\nKinsella wrote the B.C. Liberal Party election platform for the 2003 and 2005 elections. Kinsella's involvement in the political corruption trial has led observers to draw a link between the B.C. rail scandal and Gordon Campbell.\n\nAccording to an email cited by defense lawyer Kevin McCullough, Kinsella may have interceded with Premier Gordon Campbell's chief of staff to keep the sale of B.C. rail to C.N. from \"going off the tracks.\" \n\nKinsella is alleged to have been involved in entering the $505 million BC Rail tax indemnity (refund) on the books at 255 million. \n\nThe sale of BC Rail included a $505 million BC Rail tax indemnity on top of $750 million cash and $250 million in direct tax credits. Under the terms of the indemnity, if CN would not have been refunded the amount of the indemnity from the Federal Government, then the Province would be required to return this amount. This reduced the sale price of BC Rail from $1.05 billion to roughly $500 million, thereby benefiting private shareholders of CN, albeit at the expense of the public at large. The BC Rail tax indemnity was taken off the Public Accounts in January 2005, before the May 2005 election, when it was reclassified a contingent liability. \n\nThe BC Rail sale Annual Report was defective and did not cite the indemnity, and recorded these tax credits at zero book value.\n\nThe BC Rail corruption trial (\"Her Majesty the Queen v. Basi\"), Virk Basi and commonly known as the Basi-Virk Trial, started on May 17, 2010. The trial was originally scheduled by B.C. Supreme Court officials to last around six weeks.\n\nCanadian media have expressed frustration at the time it has taken to get this case to trial.\n\nA publication ban by the presiding judge put most of the B.C. rail trial – from its beginning to July 6, 2010, when the court rose for the summer, out of reach of the media and out of the public eye.\n\nPremier Gordon Campbell's chief of staff, Martyn Brown, was the first witness to appear before the jury in the B.C. Rail trial.\n\nOctober 2010 – Defendants Dave Basi and Bob Virk agreed to change their plea to guilty on a reduced number of charges.

{"id": "19997989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19997989", "title": "BREEAM", "text": "BREEAM\n\nBREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method), first published by the Building Research Establishment (BRE) in 1990, is the world's longest established method of assessing, rating, and certifying the sustainability of buildings. More than 250,000 buildings have been BREEAM-certified and over a million are registered for certification – in more than 50 countries worldwide. BREEAM also has a tool which focuses on neighborhood development. \n\nBREEAM is an assessment using scientifically based Sustainability metrics and indices that covers a range of environmental issues. Its categories evaluate energy and water use, health and wellbeing, pollution, transport, materials, waste, ecology and management processes. Buildings are rated and certified on a scale of 'Pass', 'Good', 'Very Good', 'Excellent' and 'Outstanding'. It is carried out by independent, licensed assessors.\n\nIt works to raise awareness amongst owners, occupiers and designers of the benefits of taking a sustainability approach. It helps them to successfully adopt sustainable solutions in a cost effective manner, and provides market recognition of their achievements. It aims to reduce the negative effects of construction and development on the environment.\n\nWork on creating BREEAM began at the Building Research Establishment (based in Watford, England, UK) in 1988. The first version for assessing new office buildings was launched in 1990. This was followed by versions for other buildings including superstores, industrial units and existing offices.\n\nIn 1998 there was a major revamp of the BREEAM Offices standard, and the scheme's layout, with features such as weighting for different sustainability issues, was established. The development of BREEAM then accelerated with annual updates and variations for other building types such as retail premises being introduced.\n\nA version of BREEAM for new homes called EcoHomes was launched in 2000. This scheme was later used as the basis of the Code for Sustainable Homes, which was developed by BRE for the UK Government in 2006/7 and replaced EcoHomes in England and Wales. In 2014, the Government in England signalled the winding down the Code for Sustainable homes, since then BRE has developed the Home Quality Mark which is part of the BREEAM family of schemes. \n\nAn extensive update of all BREEAM schemes in 2008 resulted in the introduction of mandatory post-construction reviews, minimum standards and innovation credits. International versions of BREEAM were also launched that year.\n\nAnother major update in 2011 resulted in the launch of BREEAM New Construction, which is now used to assess and certify all new UK buildings. This revision included the reclassification and consolidation of issues and criteria to further streamline the BREEAM process. The latest update of BREEAM UK New Construction was launched in March 2018 at Ecobuild.\n\nBREEAM has expanded from its original focus on individual new buildings at the construction stage to encompass the whole life cycle of buildings from planning to in-use and refurbishment. Its regular revisions and updates are driven by the ongoing need to improve sustainability, respond to feedback from industry and support the UK's sustainability strategies and commitments.\n\nHighly flexible, the BREEAM standard can be applied to virtually any building and location, with versions for new buildings, existing buildings, refurbishment projects and large developments:\n\nBREEAM New Construction is the BREEAM standard against which the sustainability of new, non-residential buildings in the UK is assessed. Developers and their project teams use the scheme at key stages in the design and procurement process to measure, evaluate, improve and reflect the performance of their buildings.\n\nBREEAM International New Construction is the BREEAM standard for assessing the sustainability of new residential and non-residential buildings in countries around the world, except for the UK and other countries with a national BREEAM scheme (see below). This scheme makes use of assessment criteria that take account of the circumstances, priorities, codes and standards of the country or region in which the development is located.\n\nBREEAM In-Use is a scheme to help building managers reduce the running costs and improve the environmental performance of existing buildings. It has three parts – Parts 1 (building asset) and 2 (building management) are relevant to all non-domestic, commercial, industrial, retail and institutional buildings. Part 3 (occupier management) of the BREEAM In-Use certification scheme is currently restricted to offices. BREEAM In-Use is widely used by members of the International Sustainability Alliance (ISA) which provides a platform for certification against the scheme.\n\nBREEAM Refurbishment provides a design and assessment method for sustainable housing refurbishment projects, helping to cost effectively improve the sustainability and environmental performance of existing dwellings in a robust way.\nA scheme for non-housing refurbishment projects is being developed and is targeted for launch in early 2014. The launch date will be announced once the piloting and independent peer review processes has been completed.\n\nBREEAM Communities focusses on the masterplanning of whole communities. It is aimed at helping construction industry professionals to design places that people want to live and work in, are good for the environment and are economically successful.\n\nBREEAM includes several sustainability categories for the assessment, generally\n\n\nHome Quality Mark was launched in 2015 as part of the BREEAM family of schemes. It rates new homes on their overall quality and sustainability, then provides further indicators on the homes impact upon the occupants 'Running costs', 'Health and wellbeing' and 'Environmental footprint'.\n\nBREEAM is used in more than 70 countries, with several in Europe having gone a stage further to develop country-specific BREEAM schemes operated by National Scheme Operators (NSOs). There are currently NSOs affiliated to BREEAM in:\n\n\nSchemes developed by NSOs can take any format as long as they comply with a set of overarching requirements laid down in the Code for a Sustainable Built Environment. They can be produced from scratch by adapting current BREEAM schemes to the local context, or by developing existing local schemes.\n\nA growing body of research evidence is challenging the perception, still held by many, that sustainable buildings are significantly more costly to design and build than those that simply adhere to regulatory requirements. Research by the Sweett Group into projects using BREEAM, for example, demonstrates that sustainable options often add little or no capital cost to a development project. Where such measures do incur additional costs, these can frequently be paid back through lower running expenses, ultimately leading to saving over the life of the building.\n\nResearch studies have also highlighted the enhanced value and quality of sustainable buildings. Achieving the standards required by BREEAM requires careful planning, design, specification and detailing, and a good working relationship between the client and project team – the very qualities that can produce better buildings and better conditions for building users. A survey commissioned by Schneider Electric and undertaken by BSRIA examined the experiences of a wide range of companies that had used BREEAM. The findings included, for example, that 88% think it is a good thing, 96% would use the scheme again and 88% would recommend BREEAM to others.\n\nThe greater efficiency and quality associated with sustainability are also helping to make such building more commercially successful. There is growing evidence, for example, that BREEAM-rated buildings provide increased rates of return for investors, and increased rental rates and sales premiums for developers and owners. A Maastricht University document, published by RICS Research, reported on a study of the effect of BREEAM certification on office buildings in London from 2000–2009. It found, for example, that these buildings achieved a 21% premium on transaction prices and an 18% premium on rents.\n\n"}

A total of 71.4% of all those who were naturalized in 2012 were from the non-Western world. Half of all new Danish citizenships in 2012 were given to people from Iraq, Afghanistan, Turkey, Somalia and Iran.\n\nIn October 2011, the newly elected centre-left coalition government indicated its intention to permit dual citizenship.\n\nOn December 18, 2014, Parliament passed a bill to allow Danish citizens to become foreign nationals without losing their Danish citizenship, and to allow foreign nationals to acquire Danish citizenship without renouncing their prior citizenship. A provision in the bill also allows former Danish nationals who lost their citizenship as a result of accepting another to reobtain Danish citizenship. This provision expires in 2020. A separate provision, lasting until 2017, allows current applicants for Danish citizenship who have been approved under the condition they renounce their prior citizenship to retain their prior nationality as they become Danish citizens. The law came into force on September 1, 2015.\n\nAnyone with Danish (or other) citizenship may be required by a country of which they are also citizens to give up their other (Danish) citizenship, although this cannot be enforced outside the jurisdiction of the country in question. For example Japan does not permit multiple citizenship, while Argentina has no restrictions.\n\nCitizenship of the European Union for Danish citizens varies in each part of the Danish Realm.\n\nDanish citizens in Denmark proper are also citizens of the European Union under European Union law and thus enjoy rights of free movement and have the right to vote in elections for the European Parliament. When in a non-EU country where there is no Danish embassy, Danish citizens have the right to get consular protection from the embassy of any other EU country present in that country. Danish citizens can live and work in any country within the EU as a result of the right of free movement and residence granted in Article 21 of the EU Treaty.\n\nGreenland joined the European Economic Community along with Denmark proper in 1973 but left in 1985. Although Greenland is not part of the EU, Danish citizens residing in Greenland are EU citizens.\n\nThe Faroe Islands have never been part of the EU or its predecessors, and EU treaties do not apply to the islands. Consequently, Danish citizens residing in the Faroe Islands are not EU citizens within the meaning of the treaties. However, they can choose between a non-EU Danish-Faroese passport (which is green and modelled on pre-EU Danish passport) or a regular Danish EU passport. Some EU member states may treat Danish citizens residing in the Faroe Islands the same as other Danish citizens and thus as EU citizens.\n\nConcerning citizenship of the European Union as established in the Maastricht Treaty, Denmark proper obtained an opt-out in the Edinburgh Agreement, in which EU citizenship does not replace national citizenship and each member state is free to determine its nationals according to its own nationality law. The Amsterdam Treaty extends this to all EU member states, which renders the Danish opt-out \"de facto\" meaningless.\n\nVisa requirements for Danish citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of the Kingdom of Denmark. In May 2018, Danish citizens had visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 185 countries and territories, ranking the Danish passport 5th in the world according to the Henley visa restrictions index.\n\nThe Danish nationality is ranked fourth in The Quality of Nationality Index (QNI). This index differs from the Henley Passport Index, which focuses on external factors including travel freedom. The QNI considers, besides travel freedom, internal factors such as peace & stability, economic strength, and human development as well.\n\n"}

The D.P.A. requires significant coursework beyond the masters level and a dissertation that contributes to theory or practice. Upon successful completion, the title of \"Doctor\" is awarded and the post-nominal letters of D.P.A. or DPA can be used.\n\nLike a Ph.D., a D.P.A. is normally a terminal research degree. The U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) recognize the D.P.A. as an academically equivalent degree to the more common Ph.D. and they do not discriminate between the two degrees.\n\nIn many cases, D.P.A. programs are identical to Ph.D. programs. Additionally, the D.P.A. dissertation is usually at the same level as a Ph.D. in terms of effort, rigor, contribution to knowledge, supervision and assessment. A study published by the National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration titled \"What's in a Name? Comparing DPA and Ph.D. Programs\" concluded that there was \"few differences between the programs, noting that degree title is more informative about the type of students recruited than outputs\"\n\nD.P.A. research is both theoretical and practical, but the research focus of the typical D.P.A. addresses applied issues, with the results providing professional outcomes that are of direct relevance to practice. While also intended to prepare graduates for academic careers, the D.P.A., by virtue of its focus on application of theory, has more practical application in managerial settings than the Ph.D. degree. Most D.P.A. graduates lead careers as senior-level practitioners, while others enter academia. This is similar to other professional research doctorates such as the Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) and Doctor of Education (Ed.D).\n\nA Ph.D. is more concentrated on developing theory and conducting specialized scholarly research. This degree is more appropriate for people who wish to become professional researchers, or who wish to pursue a career in academia. Most Ph.D. graduates lead careers as university researchers and professors or as senior researchers in business or government.\n\nThe Doctor of Public Administration program is designed to provide senior-level public managers, or quasi-public managers, with the substantive skills, knowledge and values necessary in this area. Students in most programs develop a thorough knowledge of the legal, ethical and political environments of public administrators. Students understand the administrative functions of governmental agencies and gain expertise in strategic planning, advanced management techniques, program implementation and results-based leadership.\n\nThe official policy of Network of Schools of Public Policy, Affairs, and Administration (NASPAA) is that the doctorate is a research degree, regardless of degree title. Its \"Policy on Doctoral Education in Public Affairs/Public Administration\" (1983,1987,1) states that: \"Doctoral programs in public administration...should prepare students to undertake significant research in their subsequent careers, whether in government, academic life, or other settings; the capacity to do significant research, rather than access to a particular career setting, is the appropriate goal of doctoral training.\"\n\nMost D.P.A. programs require about 90 credit hours of combined graduate coursework. Students are expected to take a number of core classes, electives, research/method classes, and dissertation credits. Some programs also require comprehensive examinations. All programs require a doctoral dissertation that contributes to knowledge. Candidates typically work with a committee and advisors throughout the process and the dissertation eventually requires an oral defense to the student's committee. Curricula may be offered on a full-time or part-time basis. The normal duration of a doctorate should correspond to 3–5 years of full-time graduate study or 7–10 years of sustained part-time graduate study.\n\nThe D.P.A. is preceded by a master's degree, typically the Master of Public Administration or the Master of Public Policy. D.P.A. programs are most common in the United States and the Philippines. The D.P.A. degree may have a specialization such as management science, organizational behavior, implementation, non-profit management, public finance, national security, defense policy, education policy, environmental policy, international trade and immigration, policy making, policy evaluation, program evaluation, criminal justice, civil rights, health and welfare, federalism, strategic management, public health, administrative law, social welfare, tax policy, government-business relations, economic policy, and public management.\n\n"}

Harmless error is easiest to understand in an evidentiary context. Evidentiary errors are subject to harmless error analysis, under Federal Rule of Evidence 103(a) (\"Error may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected.\") The general burden when arguing that evidence was improperly excluded or included is to show that the proper ruling by the trial judge may have, on the balance of probabilities, resulted in the opposite determination of fact.\n\nIn the case of \"Earll v. State of Wyoming\", the Wyoming Supreme Court distinguished between reversible error (which requires a conviction be overturned) and harmless error (which does not), as follows:\nIn the evidentiary context, a harmless error is usually one where the evidence had no relevance to the issues to be decided by the trier of fact, evidence admitted actually helped the party seeking the reversal, or the remaining evidence was overwhelmingly against the party seeking reversal.\n\nFor example, a prosecutor may try to bolster his case by bringing in an expert witness to explain the behavior of one of the key witnesses. If the judge allows the expert to testify that there was a reason to explain away inconsistencies in the witness's testimony, this will most likely be grounds for an appeal, as in most cases evidence that only bolsters the credibility of a witness is not admissible. However, if there were a number of other witnesses against the losing party, the appellate court may rule that this mistake was of no consequence and that even if the evidence had been excluded, the losing party would have lost.\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(a) provides that \"Any error, defect, irregularity or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.\"\n\n"}

The IVR is the world's central academic organization for the study and advancement of legal and social philosophy.\n\nThe primary activities of the IVR include a World Congress every two years, publication of the international journal \"Archiv für Rechts- und Sozialphilosophie\" (ARSP), and the IVR Encyclopedia of the Philosophy of Law and Social Philosophy. The seat of IVR is in Wiesbaden, in the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\nThe IVR is divided into autonomous national sections embracing most of the nations of the world. \n\nMany notable academics have served as president of the organization, including Neil MacCormick (Scotland), Ulfrid Neumann (Germany), Enrico Pattaro (Italy), Eugenio Bulygin (Argentina) and Mortimer Sellers (U.S.).\n\nThe International Association for the Philosophy of Law and Social Philosophy (IVR) was founded in 1909 as the “Internationale Vereinigung für Rechts- und Sozialphilosophie”. Two years ago, the journal „Archiv für Rechts- und Wirtschaftsphilosphie mit besonderer Berücksichtigung der Gesetzgebungsfragen“ („Archive for Philosophy of Law and Economic Philosophy with special Regard to the Issues of Legislation“) had been found. The foundation of the „Archive“ took place during a phase of revivification of the philosophy of law in Germany, which began at the end of the 19th century and continued to spread at the beginning of the 20th century. The founding fathers of both the „Archive“ in 1907 and later in 1909 also of the IVR were Josef Kohler (1849–1919) and Fritz Berolzheimer (1869–1920).\n\nFounding father Fritz Berolzheimer (1869–1920):\nFrom Arthur Kohler‘s essay „Von der Wiege des Archivs“ (From the cradle of the Archive) from 1930/31 we know, that the idea for founding a Journal for the philosophy of law on a neo-idealistic basis was from Fritz Berolzheimer, a lawyer and private scholar from Munich. This idea coincided with Kohler‘s distinctive interest in founding new academic enterprises. Both men knew each other from academic correspondence, which derived from the publishing of Berolzheimer‘s five-volume „System der Rechts- und Wirtschaftsphilosophie“ („A system of Philosophy of Law and Economic Philosophy“, 1904–1907/08). This opus dealt not only with Hegel, but also with Josef Kohler‘s philosophy intensively. In 1906, Berolzheimer even wrote an article on „J. Kohler as an philosopher of law“ („J. Kohler als Rechtsphilosoph“).\n\nFounding father Josef Kohler (1849–1919):\nJosef Kohler was born in Offenburg, Grand Duchy of Baden (Southwestern Germany). After studying law in Freiburg and Heidelberg, Kohler at first worked as lawyer and-later-as a judge in Mannheim. In 1878 he was appointed professor for Civil Procedure in Würzburg, which is remarkable because even though Kohler was a doctor of law and was experienced in the practice of law, he was not officially qualified to give postdoctoral lectures. After ten years in Würzburg, Kohler in 1888 accepted a call to a chair in Berlin. It was Berlin which inspired him to go further, scientifically and as an artist. He died there after 30 years of tireless work in 1919. \n\nKohler and Berolzheimer:\nKohler and Berolzheimer were as different as they could be. Berolzheimer was not, as Kohler, an unresting scientist, who „wants to deduce and thus conquer one sphere of being after the other“. Other than Kohler, Berolzheimer was oriented „to the great principles fully“. A \"systematic\", who subordinated „all findings to these principles“. And he was „tirelessly“ trying to „convince and persuade his fellow men and women of these principles.“\n\nFounding father Walter Rothschild (1879–1967):\nWith Kohler and Berolzheimer there were two motivated and proficient authors. But they lacked somebody to give them a voice. The man to give Kohler and Berolzheimer this voice was young publisher Walther Rothschild (1879-1967), who was about to establish a Publishing house for cultural studies and political philosophy. He made the duo a triumvirate. With regard to this triumvirate, Arthur Kohler, the son of Josef Kohler, reports: „Josef Kohler was a great inspirer and stimulator, though every detail had to be reviewed by him, and he entertained international connections and footing; Berolzheimer was particularly engaged in the details of editing and was a proficient organizer; Rothschild knew how to propagate expertly.“\n\nRothschild Publishing House:\nThe \"Archive\" originally was published by the Dr. Walther Rothschild Verlagsbuchhandlung (Dr. Walther Rothschild Publishing House). Estimated in 1905, Rothschild Publishing House soon became a well respected Publisher for cultural studies, political philosophy, and philosophy of law. \nThe fundamental idea of Rothschild Publishing House is well described by the following words celebrating the 25th anniversary in 1930: “The work of the scholar prospers in solitude. Trusting his own strain of thoughts alone and without any help, the scholar seeks to deduce the laws of the world, to find formulations that are valid. (…) For the scientific person, the penetration of the absolute means happiness and fulfillment. The general public is indifferent to this internal process, at first. The sphere of privacy will be crossed only when the publisher gives these thoughts a broader footing; when he makes a book out of a manuscript. In this way, ideas go out to the world. Printed work imparts results and further tasks to the scientific world. It creates intellectual currents which connect times and countries.”\nOwner and leading figure of the publishing house was Historian Walther Rothschild (1879–1967). Historian Walter Rothschild (Doctor of philosophy 1902) was owner and leading figure of the Dr. Walther Rothschild Verlagsbuchhandlung (Dr. Walther Rothschild Publishing House). Although of the same name, he was not related to the famous Jewish family. However, Rothschild was forced to withdraw from the publishing business in 1933. He then emigrated to the USA, where he died in Carmel/CA in 1967.\nIn 1933, Rothschild Publishing House ended publishing the „Archive“. It was the same year the publishing house „vanished“ from the index of Berlin booksellers—the reason for this has not been clarified until now. The „Archive“ was taken over by the „Verlag für Staatswissenschaften und Geschichte“ (1933-38; „Publishing house for Political Sciences and History“), followed by the „Albert Limbach Verlag“ (1938–44).\n\n166 Persons have been listed as Founding Members of the IVR in Oct. 1st, 1909 \nMainly they came from: Germany (96), Austria-Hungary (14), The Netherlands (11), Switzerland (9), Italy (6), Russia (6).\n\nPresidents:\nAccording to its Statute of 1909, the IVR was chaired by three Presidents: Fritz Berolzheimer as Managing President (Geschäftsleitender Vorsitzender), Carl Fürstenberg as Financial President (Vorsitzender für die Vermögensangelegenheiten), and Josef Kohler as Honorary President (Ehrenpräsident).\n\nHonorary Council:\nMoreover, the Statute of 1909 demanded a Council of Honorary Councillors from 15 non-German nations (Ehrenrat der außerdeutschen Kulturstaaten. Among these were well-known scholars like French sociologist Émile Durkheim and Italian legal philosopher. But among these councillors were also delegates from far-away countries like Ernesto Quesada from Buenos Aires (Argentina), Clovis Bevilaqua from Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) and Govindo Dàs from Benares (India).\n\nAdvisory Committee:\nThe Managing President was also supported by an Advisory Committee consisting of 40 members, who were in charge for advisory opinions for important matters.\n\nIVR Patrons:\nIt was clear to the founders that the activities of the new association had to be financed. In order to fulfil this need, the IVR Statute of 1909 ruled that a patronage could be achieved by donating at least 1.000 Marks. In the history of the association, two persons opened up their wallets and served as IVR Patrons: Industrialist and maecenas Wilhelm Merton (1848–1916). He was the owner of the Metallgesellschaft, which was one of the largest industrial companies in the world. Merton is regarded as one of the most prominent industrialists in the Wilhelmenian period. Bankier Wilhelm von Pechmann (1859–1949), who was Directorate Member of the Bayerische Handelsbank München (Bavarian Merchant Bank). Patronage was abolished under the rule of the Statute of 1935/36.\n\nIVR Protector:\nAccording to § 7 of the IVR statute of 1909, one could become Protektor of the association (meaning a patron). At this time, protectorate mainly was offered to nobility. In 1910, Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine (1868–1937; Reign 1892–1918) agreed to be a IVR Protector. The Grand Duke was a great patron of the arts; his motto was “My Hesse should flourish, and the art in Hesse too” (“Mein Hessenland blühe und in ihm die Kunst”). In his residence at the south Hessian city of Darmstadt, he was founder of the Darmstadt Artists' Colony with Art Nouveau buildings (in Germany commonly known as “Jugendstil”). It was this very city where the association's second congress took place in 1911. The Protectorate was abolished by the statute of 1935/36, one year before the death of the last Grand Duke of Hesse in 1937.\n\nFirst IVR congress in Berlin 1910:\nIn May 1910, the first IVR Congress was held in Berlin at the Preußisches Herrenhaus (Prussian House of Lords). The Congress was attended by about 70 participants and 20 accompanying wives - mostly, but not all, Germans. The academic program, consisting of about 10 lectures, focused on basic questions of the philosophy of Law. Both founding fathers Kohler and Berolzheimer gave programmatic lectures: Kohler gave one on „Aufgaben und Ziele der Rechtsphilosophie“ („Tasks and Aims of Philosophy of Law“) and Berolzheimer on „Der Methodenstreit in der Rechtsphilosophie der Gegenwart“ („Dispute over Method in current Philosophy of Law“). A lecture was given by Walter Pollack using a diascope (\"Lichtbilderdemonstration\"). The social program of the first congress was quite modest: a welcoming evening at the Palace Hotel and two afternoon receptions at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Kohler and Mr. and Mrs. Fürstenberg (the latter having a grand villa in western Berlin, in Grunewald). In 1910 as well, Kohler was dean of the faculty of law, celebrating the jubilee of the University‘s founding. Under the aegis of dean Kohler, American president Roosevelt and the German Emperor were granted Honorary Doctors.\n\nSecond IVR Congress in Darmstadt 1911:\nIn 1911, the second IVR congress took place in Darmstadt under the patronage of Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine (1868–1937). The congress was attended by about 120 delegates – many of them members from South Hessian judicial authority. On the second day, even the Grand Duke himself was attending the congress. The academic program consisted of about 12 lectures. Special attention was given to questions of reform, especially with regard to legal education and judicial training.\n\nThird IVR Congress in Frankfurt 1914:\nIn 1914, the third IVR congress took place in Frankfurt. Originally the congress was intended to take place at the Royal Academy in the east Prussian city of Posen (Poznań, now west-central Poland), but was relocated to Frankfurt. In Frankfurt, the congress took place at the Akademie für Sozial- und Handelswissenschaften (Academy for Social and Commercial Sciences). The academy was founded in 1901 and was financed by the city of Frankfurt. It became one of the founding institutions of the university in 1914. The congress was attended by about 170 delegates and concentrated on practical questions of law and economy; nevertheless, IVR Presidents Josef Kohler und Fritz Berolzheimer contributed programmed lectures on “Grenzen der Rechtsphilosophie” (Limits of the Philosophy of Law) and “Programm des Neo-Hegelianismus” (Programme of Neo-Hegelism).\nCoincidentally, the congress files of the third congress have been preserved at the Frankfurt city archive: letters by the organizing committee, minutes of meetings. Even the invoice of the reception at the Römer (The Roman), Frankfurt town hall, has been preserved - by the way, the same place, the reception of the 25th World Congress will take place. The preserved writings provide an insight into the process of organizing a congress in the early days of the IVR. In fact, many matters the organizers had to arrange with, sound familiar: continuous meetings of the organizing committee; negotiations about favourable alternatives for accommodation and transport etc.; configuration of a social program (Geselligkeitsprogramm) for all participants, consisting of a city reception, a reception at the Frankfurt Chamber of Trade (Handelskammer), and an excursion to the reconstructed Roman fort Saalburg located on the Taunus ridge near famous spa town Bad Homburg. The reception at the Town hall was paid by the city of Frankfurt (in total 1092,90 Marks). Besides the cost of catering, this sum included cigars (35,35 Marks) and a red carpet at the Kaisertreppe (Emperor‘s staircase). The staircase was destroyed in World War II, but its portal has remained and can be seen during the City Reception.\n\nIn the years 1919/1920, the Association had to bear a big loss - the passing of its founders Josef Kohler (†1919) and Fritz Berolzheimer (†1920). The IVR was then presided by private law scholar Peter Klein (1880-1926), and after his death in 1925, by criminal law scholar Wilhelm Sauer (1879–1962) and Goetz Briefs (1889–1974). The last congress of old series was held in Berlin in 1926.\nIn 1933, two changes took place: firstly, the Archive‘s name was changed to „Archiv für Rechts- und Sozialphilosophie“ („Archive for Philosophy of Law and Social Philosophy“); secondly, Rothschild Publishing House seized to publish the „Archive“ and vanished from the index of Berlin booksellers – the reason for this has not been clarified until now. \nAfter the takeover of power by the National Socialists in 1933, Vice President Goetz Briefs, being a Catholic social philosopher, was removed from office and forced to leave the country. He emigrated to the USA. After being a guest lecturer at the Catholic University in Washington D.C., he became a full Professor at Georgetown University in 1937.\nIn 1935, Carl August Emge (1886–1970) became president of the IVR and also editor of the „Archive“. Since 1933, Emge was a professor for philosophy of law at Berlin University. Concerning the political orientation, in 1948, it was emphasized in favor of Emge, \"that the IVR was not subordinated to any other organization and maintained its apolitical, purely scientific character\".\nIn 1944, the IVR was dissolved in the war-confusion. At this time, the association had nearly 1000 members.\n\nAfter resurrection in 1948, the first IVR world congress was held in Saarbrücken (Germany) in 1957, followed by the Congress in Vienna (Austria), in 1959. After this, the world congresses were ordinarily organized every four years, occasionally supplemented by an extraordinary congress. Since 1981, the world congress is organized every two years (see box below). The first congress outside Europe was organized by Gray Dorsey (IVR President 1975-79) in St. Louis (USA) in 1975. Before this, the IVR primarily was a European organization with a few national sections abroad, the largest in Japan and in the USA. During the presidency of Dorsey, the IVR became a worldwide organization. Soon after the congress in St. Louis, Congresses were held in Australia (Sydney & Canberra 1977), Mexico (Mexico City 1981), and Japan (Kobe 1987).\n\nThe association has over 2000 members worldwide. They are organized in 41 national sections, which are autonomous with respect to the organization of their events and also solely responsible for their financial affairs.\n\nThe Association is governed by its Executive Committee, which is chaired by the association 's president. The president is elected by the members.\n\nIVR Executive Committee 2015/19\n\nThe following persons have served as Presidents of the Association:\n\nExecutive Committee 1909\n\nExecutive Committee 1919/20-1933/34\n\nExecutive Committee 1925/26-1933/34\n\nExecutive Committee 1935-1944\n\nExecutive Committee 1948-1953\n\nExecutive Committee 1953-1957\n\nExecutive Committee 1957-1959\n\nIVR Presidents 1959-83\n\nThe Archive for Philosophy of Law and Social Philosophy (Archiv für Rechts- und Sozialphilosophie, ARSP) contains scholarly peer-reviewed articles in various languages (inter alia German, English, French and Spanish) on legal and social philosophy. It is published in annual volumns as well as special issues (Beihefte). The editor-in-chief of the ARSP is Prof. Dr. Ulfrid Neumann. It is under the editorial supervision of Dr. Annette Brockmöller.\n\nThe American section of the International Association for the Philosophy of Law and Social Philosophy (Amintaphil) publishes the book series \"Amintaphil: The Philosophical Foundations of Law and Justice.\"\n\nList of Old series conferences\n\nList of New series conferences\n\nAs we get to know by Arthur Kohler, the son of IVR’s Founding father Josef Kohler, in former times the „Archive‘s“ editorial meeting were held at the Romanisches Café in Berlin (Romanesque Cafe). \nThe Romanisches Café (Romanesque Café) was located in the ground floor of a neo-romanesque building complex vis-à-vis to the famous Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedächtniskirche (Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church) in western Berlin, which was also build in romanesque style. Towards the end of World War I, the Café became the meeting place of the bohemian society of Berlin, especially after the „Café des Westens“ (Café of the West), a famous artists‘ café, had to relocate and was shut down in 1915. Every group had its regulars table - painters, philosophers, journalists, critics, dramatists, essayists, psychoanalysts. Following a secret hierarchy, the café was divided in two sections: a place called „nonswimmer pond“ („Nichtschwimmer-Bassin“) for guests and tourists, and the „swimmer pond“ „Schwimmer-Bassin“) for regulars, celebrities and - on a gallery - chess players. The permission to enter the swimmer pond had to be worked on hard and was strictly controlled by the doorman.\nGerman Author and satirist Erich Kästner reports: „The “Romanisches Café“ (Romanesque Café) is the ante room for talents. There are people who have been waiting here for twenty years, every day, for talent. They possess, if nothing else, the ability to wait to an extraordinary degree. (…) They are an infernal mass of eccentrics and those who would like to be so. The first impression is: Hair, manes, curls that fall into eyes, fraught with meaning. The second impression: How often do they change their underwear? This impression may be unjustified in many cases. But on the other hand, nothing could be more distinctive for the seen, than that one has this impression in the first place.“\n\n2.482 publications derive from Kohler‘s hand. The bibliography from 1931/12, which was compiled by his son Arthur Kohler in 10 years of work, enlists publications concerning truly to all branches of law such as Patent Law, Intellectual Property Law, and Comparative Law. Moreover, Kohler was artistically active, composing music and poetry. It has been calculated, that Kohler in average published one paper a week; and his son reports of 20 hour shifts For his contemporary colleagues, this overwhelming creative power was either criticized because of its skechyness or admired as product of the last „universal scholar“, sometimes this creativity was even perceived as „eerie“ ( Surely „the greatest legal graphomaniac of all times and worlds“ \n\n\n"}

{"id": "16019354", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16019354", "title": "Jurisdictional arbitrage", "text": "Jurisdictional arbitrage\n\nJurisdictional arbitrage is the practice of taking advantage of the discrepancies between competing legal jurisdictions. It takes its name from arbitrage, the practice in finance of purchasing a good at a lower price in one market and selling it at a higher price in another. Just as in financial arbitrage, the attractiveness of jurisdiction arbitrage depends largely on its transaction costs, here the costs of switching legal service providers from one government to another.\n\nThe lower the exit costs for leaving the jurisdiction (unrestricted emigration, cheap travel, liquidity of assets) the more desirable and feasible it is. Conversely, high entry costs into the more favourable jurisdiction are an inhibitor on jurisdictional arbitrage; certain tax havens such as Andorra grant permanent residency rights to immigrants only if they meet certain criteria. Jurisdictional arbitrage is a significant concept in modern free market anarcho-capitalism, not to be confused with anarchism per se.\n\nThe practice of individuals seeking asylum involves appealing to a jurisdiction with favorable individual rights for residency, where the individual's native jurisdiction is seen to offer insufficient protection. For example, women have fled West African nations which practice tribal female genital mutilation and/or extremist Islam in favour of European and North American jurisdictions.\n\nTo avoid arbitrary restrictions on skilled immigration, high-tech companies may set up offices in countries neighboring those with the restrictive policies, preferably in locations close to the border, as was the case with Microsoft's plans to open a satellite office in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, situated only 140 miles (225 km) from its headquarters in the Seattle suburb of Redmond, Washington in the United States. In Silicon Valley, a project is underway to launch a ship 12 nautical miles from the shore, in international waters, with the goal of allowing entrepreneurs without US work visas to legally create and work for companies close to the area (see Blueseed).\n\nOn the other hand, jurisdictional arbitrage has also been utilized to hinder attempts at governmental prosecution, by transnational criminals such as terrorists, money launderers, and cyber-attackers.\n\nPrior to recent international mobilization against the practice, there existed a long-standing tradition of ousted state leaders such as Erich Honecker, Idi Amin and Augusto Pinochet finding refuge and retirement abroad to avoid prosecution in their native jurisdiction. Pinochet, one-time military leader of Chile sought to evade retributive prosecution in his native jurisdiction by seeking refuge in the United Kingdom. He was later prosecuted by a Spanish court according to the principle of universal jurisdiction.\n\nTo counteract this phenomenon, most countries have signed bilateral extradition treaties with most other countries, and some governments adopted the principle of universal jurisdiction, which has enabled individuals to be prosecuted for offences (particularly alleged human rights violations and war crimes) committed outside the jurisdiction of prosecution – the legal structure of nations such as Belgium and Spain allow for this, as does that of international tribunals operating under the aegis of the United Nations.\n\nA similar attempt at governmental collusion to limit the use of jurisdictional arbitrage for tax avoidance is the policy of tax harmonization. The membership of European governments in the European Union resulted in a collection of nations with a limited set of common legal structures (Four Freedoms) which has resulted in tax competition by the otherwise less-developed nations (such as the Republic of Ireland in the early 1990s) whereby governments compete for foreign investment by lowering their tax rates significantly below those of their neighbours. This strategy has been adopted in the form of a flat tax by various Eastern European nations, which has resulted in calls for harmonization of tax rates by the traditionally more developed nations such as France, Britain and Germany.\n\nAnarcho-capitalists hope that by subdividing existing governmental jurisdictions into city-states (such as Singapore), competition among jurisdictions for citizens will lead to a diversity of legal climates including more favourable jurisdictions for liberty and self-determination. Cypherpunks and crypto-anarchists also cite low exit costs and fluidity of movement across jurisdictions as a significant means of advancing individual freedom through the free movement of information and capital. The concept of seasteading is an attempt to increase the possibility of jurisdictional arbitrage by decreasing the cost of switching governments. It is worth noting that there is nothing anarchist about jurisdictional arbitrage, since it is a strategy based on profiting from the differences between regulatory regimes, and therefore incompatible with the abolition of the state.\n\nA notable proponent and practitioner of jurisdictional arbitrage is Canadian businessman and perpetual traveler Calvin Ayre, founder of online gambling consortium Bodog Entertainment Group. Although online gambling is illegal in the United States, a market which accounts for 95% of Bodog's sales, the company pays no corporate taxes there as its activities are distributed across different jurisdictions to minimise tax burden. \"We run a business that can't actually be described as gambling in each country we operate in. But when you add it all together, it’s Internet gambling.\"\n\n"}

Personal residential property losses do not fit under any of the enumerated categories under Internal Revenue Code section 165(c). Furthermore, Income Tax Treasury Regulation section 1.165-9 states that a loss sustained on the sale of residential property purchased or constructed by the taxpayer for use as his personal residence and so used by him up to the time of the sale is not deductible under Internal Revenue Code section 165(a).\n\nHowever, if, prior to the sale of the personal residence, the taxpayer converts the residential property into a rental property, a loss sustained on the sale of the property will be deductible under Internal Revenue Code section 165(c)(2).

He is one of a small number of former Americans known to have voluntarily become stateless to evade US law enforcement. There is an outstanding arrest warrant for Gogulski due to his involvement in running a bitcoin tumbler used in criminal activities.\n\nGogulski's grandparents emigrated to the U.S. in the 19th century; his paternal grandparents from near Poznań, Poland and his maternal grandparents from Germany. Gogulski was born in Phoenix, Arizona, but his family moved to Orlando, Florida soon after due to his father's job as an electromechanical engineer. He has a younger sister, Karen. He attended Lake Howell High School, where he was a National Merit Scholarship Program finalist and a brain bowl team member; he graduated in 1990.\n\nGogulski entered Orlando College in 1990 to study computer science. In April 1992, while still a student there and living in Casselberry, Florida, he became the first person to be arrested by the Orange County Sheriff's Office for computer hacking. Police stated that he had stolen at least $30,000 of long-distance telephone services. Among the victims of the theft were the county government, a tutorial service at the University of Florida, and an auto dealership. Charged with one count of violating the Florida Communications Fraud Act, he pleaded guilty in Seminole County Circuit Court; under a plea agreement, he received two years of probation, but a formal ruling of guilt was withheld and no further charges were filed. He later lost interest in his studies and withdrew from school. Nevertheless, he went on to a ten-year career as a system administrator.\n\nGogulski's father died in 2001. In 2004, Gogulski left the U.S. to teach English in Eastern Europe. He eventually ended up in Bratislava, Slovakia, where he became a translator, proofreader, and editor.\n\nGogulski renounced his citizenship in December 2008, though his name did not appear in the Internal Revenue Service's Quarterly Publication of Individuals Who Have Chosen to Expatriate until February 2011. He was living in Slovakia at the time. After Gogulski renounced, the Slovak authorities issued a stateless person's travel document to him. He thus needs a United States visa in order to visit his mother, but he suspects that he would be unable to obtain one. He states that he is eligible to apply for Slovak citizenship, but prefers to remain stateless. As a legal resident of Slovakia, he can travel freely throughout the Schengen Area. In 2012 he was denied a British visa, an issue which he attributed to the short remaining validity period of his travel document.\n\nGogulski stated that he renounced his citizenship in order to repudiate the American system, which he felt was the source of many wrongs in the world. Gogulski has stated that he hopes to start a mass movement of Americans giving up citizenship and making themselves stateless \"en masse\". He receives occasional enquiries from others who are interested in following in his footsteps and becoming stateless themselves; he advises them to \"understand all the implications\" before they make the leap, pointing out that while he has faced few hardships due to his statelessness, others may find it more difficult due to their personal situations.\n\nIn 1999, Gogulski founded the Connecticut Cannabis Policy Forum, which aimed to remove all penalties for adult marijuana consumption. In 2010, Gogulski founded the Private Manning Support Network, which organised protests in support of Chelsea Manning (a U.S. soldier convicted of disclosing classified documents to WikiLeaks) and raised $50,000 to fund her legal defense.\n\nAs a software developer, Gogulski has contributed open source code on GitHub, including a PHP library for the decentralised digital currency bitcoin. He is also an active member of the online forum Bitcointalk.org and has been interviewed on bitcoin by Russia Today. He operates the Bitcoin Laundry, a service which allows users to exchange their bitcoins for other bitcoins which have a different transaction history.\n\n"}

Its duties were subsequently taken up by the federal Ministry of Justice of the united Germany, and the justice ministries of the six new federal states. The Ministry was housed at 93 Dorothea Street (Dorotheenstraße 93), the former offices of the Weimar and Nazi Interior Ministry. It published the journal \"Neue Justiz\".\n\nAfter the Second World War and the collapse of Nazism in May 1945, Germany was divided into four zones of occupation, with the area that would become East Germany occupied by the Soviet Union. It was governed by the Soviet Military Administration in Germany, (German: \"Sowjetische Militäradministration in Deutschland\" (SMA)). On 17 July 1945, the SMAD issued Order No. 17, which established a judicial system in the Soviet occupation zone. The German Central Administration for Justice (German: Deutsche Zentralverwaltung für Justiz (DJV)) was subsequently founded in November 1945, with the SMAD appointing Eugen Schiffer as their first DJV president, though he was dismissed and replaced in 1948 with Max Fechner. In 1949, with the founding of the German Democratic Republic as a nominally independent state, the DJV was transformed into the Ministry of Justice.\n\nMax Fechner was appointed the first Minister of Justice. By this time, the judiciary had already been brought into line with communist policy. Though mentioned in the Constitution of East Germany, there was no guarantee of judicial independence. The use of Volksrichter (English People's Judges) also helped to bring the courts closer to the SED. In 1953, the Länder of the Eastern Zone were abolished, and their Justice Ministries became part of the central ministry. After speaking critically of the prosecution of strikers in the protests of June 1953 in an interview with Neues Deutschland, Fechner was removed from office, denounced as an \"enemy of the state and the party\" and spent three years in prison and Stasi internment. He was replaced by Hilde Benjamin, who had presided over the show trials of the 1950s.\n\nIn 1963, the power of the ministry was weakened by a decree which transferred responsibility for control of the courts to the Supreme Court of East Germany, which reported directly to the State Council. \n\nAfter the fall of the Berlin wall, the Ministry of Justice oversaw the transfer of its powers back to the states and the drafting of the Unification treaty under the supervision of Kurt Wünsche.\n\n<onlyinclude></onlyinclude>\n\n"}

If the catering company shows up but provides only the drinks (but not the food, which was also paid for), it is considered misfeasance. If the catering company accepts a bribe from the client's competitor to undercook the meat, thereby giving those present food poisoning, it is considered malfeasance.\n\nThe rule of law laid down is that an action in contract (\"ex contractu\") will lie for any of the three. However, an action in tort (\"ex delicto\") will lie only in misfeasance or malfeasance. The doctrine was formerly applied to certain callings carried on publicly.\n\nNow, the terms misfeasance and nonfeasance are most often used with reference to the conduct of municipal authorities with reference to the discharge of their statutory obligations; and it is an established rule that an action lies in favour of persons injured by misfeasance, by negligence in discharge of the duty but that in the case of nonfeasance the remedy is not by action but by indictment or \"mandamus\" or by the particular procedure prescribed by the statutes.\n\nThis rule is fully established in the case of failure to repair public highways, but in other cases, the courts are astute to find evidence of carelessness in the discharge of public duties and on that basis to award damages to individuals who have suffered.\n\nMisfeasance is also used with reference to the conduct of directors and officers of joint-stock companies. The word is sometimes used as equivalent to malpractice by a medical practitioner.\n\n"}

Williams, 104 N.W. 12 (Minn. 1905) is a decision of the Minnesota Supreme Court authored by Calvin L. Brown. For almost a century, this case has been used in first-year Torts classes in American law schools to teach students about consent.\n\nDr. Williams was a physician and surgeon, practicing in Saint Paul, Minnesota and specializing in disorders of the ear. Mrs. Mohr was a patient who came to Dr. Williams complaining of trouble with her right ear. Dr. Williams examined her right ear and he discovered that there was a large perforation in the eardrum, that there was a large polyp in the middle ear, and that the ossicles of the middle ear were probably diseased. Dr. Williams also examined Mrs. Mohr's left ear, but he was unable to make a full examination because of a foreign substance in the left ear.\n\nOn Dr. Williams' recommendation, Mrs. Mohr agreed to have surgery on her right ear to remove the polyp and diseased ossicles. Anesthetics were used during the operation. After the patient was unconscious, Dr. Williams made a full examination of Mrs. Mohr's left ear and discovered that it was in a worse state than her right ear: there was a small perforation high up in the drum membrane, hooded and with rough edges, and the bone of the inner wall of the middle ear was diseased and dead. Dr. Williams also examined the right ear and found that it was not in as bad a condition as he had anticipated. He therefore decided to operate on the left ear instead of the right, performing an ossiculectomy, removing a part of the drum membrane and scraping away the diseased portion of the inner ear.\n\nMrs. Mohr later brought suit against Dr. Williams, claiming that he had damaged her hearing and seriously injured her person, and that, because she had not consented to surgery on her left ear, his actions were wrongful and unlawful and constituted an assault and battery. Mrs. Mohr asked the court to award her $20,000 in damages. A trial was held in the district court for Ramsey County, Minnesota and the jury found for Mrs. Mohr and awarded her $14,322.50 in damages. The trial judge set aside the jury's verdict as excessive. Both parties appealed.\n\nOn appeal, Mrs. Mohr's lawyers, H. A. Loughran and S. C. Olmstead, argued that Mrs. Mohr's consent was necessary and without consent, Dr. Williams' actions constituted an assault and battery. Dr. Williams' lawyers, Keith, Evans, Thompson & Fairchild and John D. O'Brien, argued that in circumstances such as this, where a physician acted to arrest disease and save life, a physician's actions should be held lawful even if the patient did not explicitly consent to the surgery.\n\nIn an opinion authored by Calvin L. Brown, the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled in favor of the plaintiff, Mrs. Mohr.\n\nJustice Brown began by noting the basic principle of the law that \"every person has a right to complete immunity of his person from physical interference of others, except in so far as contact may be necessary under the general doctrine of privilege; and any unauthorized touching of the person of another, except it be in the spirit of pleasantry, constitutes an assault and battery.\" Unlike the crime of assault and battery which requires proof of a bad intent, for the tort of assault and battery, a touching is unlawful if it is unauthorized regardless of the defendant's intent. Whether Dr. Williams' actions were authorized by Mrs. Mohr was a question of fact to be determined by the jury. The court held that the fact that Mrs. Mohr's family physician attended the operation and agreed with Dr. Williams' decision to operate on the left ear was irrelevant.\n\nThe court therefore affirmed the orders of the lower court.\n\n"}

Also duplicates and stolen releases from other pirates that do not attribute the other pirates will be nuked. When a scene release is \"nuked\", a message is attached to its listing informing other sceners of its \"nuked\" status, as well as the specific nature of the problem.\n\nContrary to what the term implies, a nuke does not actually destroy offending content or prevent anyone from downloading it. A nuke merely serves as a cautionary flag to potential users. The person that uploaded the nuked content to a site will lose credits.\n\nTitles can only be officially labeled as \"nuked\" by people who have special access to a listing database, often referred to as \"nukers\". The nuke is issued by a nuke command in a nuke channel. For example:\nErroneous nukes are usually \"un-nuked\" easily, by the same people who have access to issue nukes, that nukes and unnukes happen on IRC. These nuke networks have their own guidelines on how to nuke a release. In 2008, twelve of those nuke networks created a coalition to work together \"to ensure nukers bias, nukewars and many other problems that plague the nuke scene become a thing of the past.\"\n\nLocal nukes or site nukes can be issued by a topsite administrator and are only applicable to that site. Each individual site has rules for which kind of releases that are allowed. e.g. no VCD releases. Hence a locally nuked release can still be valid.\n\nThe situation where a release is nuked or unnuked more than four times is called a nukewar.\n\nExample of a nukewar. The first two columns represent the time when the release was pred or when a nuke was issued. The next column is the category of the release. In this example two releases were released at almost the same time.\nAnother source shows different timestamps. \nThe clock of a computer is not always accurate. This and the difference in timezone partially explain the time difference. This shows why this nukewar was started.\n\nZoNeNET, EthNet and oneNET confirmed the precedent to leave both releases unnuked when groups pre within the same second.\n\nAnother example is the nukewar about the TDRS2K10 ruleset. The name between the square brackets is the nuke network where the nuke originates from. Each of those networks in this example was also a council member network.\n\nExamples of content that could be \"nuked\" include non-working software, non-working cracks, videos with out-of-sync audio, watermarked videos, or music recordings with excessive \"skips\". The reason for a nuke is based on violations of the standards that must be followed.\nPre network (aka Nukenet) is a collection of databases which share information about releases among the members of the network. There are approximately 20 different pre networks. Peers can be linked to more than one network. Linking to other network provides information which isn't available on peers local pre network. Such information can be .sfv, .m3u, .jpg, .diz or .nfo files.\n\nEach release that gets released will result as a record in a pre-database. \nThis record will at least contain the time the release was released and the release name (the name of the folder that contains the files of the release). \nThe size and nature of the release are often provided too. \nNukes are linked with their release in these databases when a nuke is issued. To check if a release is nuked, a scener uses an IRC channel to query the database by typing commands. These IRC channels are called pre channels and are often not accessible for the general public. \nThe database is updated automatically through spidering topsites or by catching pre-release announcements from site channels.\nThe purpose of these different worldwide and mirrored pre databases is to check for fakes and that for example a music album or movie isn't pred more than once and thus reducing traffic.\n\nThere are now several public websites and IRC channels that list the contents of pre-databases. Most of them are regularly updated and show nuke reasons next to their release. They can be regularly down, very slow when searching or disappeared entirely. The server time is shown on some of them.\nA pre channel is an IRC channel in which a prebot announces new warez (pre) releases in real time. Pre channels are generally provided as a convenience to members of the scene, often in conjunction with a topsite. Pre channels are typically private.\n\nAdvantages:\nDisadvantages:\n\nA prebot is commonly known as an automated script in IRC channels that announces new releases and can let users query its database to view past warez release dates and nukes, among other things. Another kind of prebot was adopted in 2000 due to the increased competition among release groups. This prebot automatically distributed new releases to affiliated topsites of a group to release faster and more efficiently. This solved geographical and time zone related issues.\n\n\n"}

Other sites targeted included money laundering sites and \"contraband sites\". The operation involved the police forces of 17 countries. In total there were 17 arrests. A 26-year-old software developer was arrested in San Francisco and accused of running Silk Road 2.0 under the pseudonym 'Defcon'. Defcon was \"one of the primary targets\". Within hours of the seizure a third incarnation of the site appeared, 'Silk Road 3.0'; Silk Road had previously been seized in October 2013, and then resurrected, weeks later, as 'Silk Road 2.0'.\n\n$1 million in Bitcoin was seized, along with €180,000 in cash, gold, silver and drugs. Of the \n\"illicit services\" that were initially claimed to have been shut down, few were online marketplaces like Silk Road. A complaint filed on 7 November 2014 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, \"seeking the forfeiture of any and all assets of the following dark market websites operating on the Tor network\", referred to just 27 sites, fourteen of which were claimed to be drug markets; the others allegedly sold counterfeit currency, forged identity documents or stolen credit cards.\n\nUS and European agencies sought to publicise the claimed success of their six-month-long operation, which \"went flawlessly\". The UK National Crime Agency sent out a tweet mocking Tor users. The official Europol press release quoted a US Homeland Security Investigations official, who stated: \"Our efforts have disrupted a website that allows illicit black-market activities to evolve and expand, and provides a safe haven for illegal vices, such as weapons distribution, drug trafficking and murder-for-hire.\"\n\nOther leading drug markets in the Deep Web were unaffected, such as Agora, Evolution and Andromeda. Whereas Silk Road did not in fact distribute weapons, or offer contract killings, Evolution did allow trade of weapons as well as drugs. Prior to the closure of Silk Road 2.0, Agora already carried more listings than Silk Road, and Evolution was also expected to overtake it. Agora and Evolution are more professional operations than Silk Road, with more advanced security; the arrest of the alleged Silk Road manager is thought to have been largely due to a series of careless mistakes.\n\nThe figure of 414 dark net sites, which was widely reported internationally, and appeared in many news headlines, was later adjusted without explanation to \"upward of 50\" sites. The true figure is thought to be nearer to 27 sites, to which all 414 .onion addresses direct. Australian journalist Nik Cubrilovic claimed to have discovered 276 seized sites, based on a crawl of all onion sites, of which 153 were scam, clone or phishing sites.\n\nThe number of sites that police initially claimed to have infiltrated led to speculation that a weakness in the Tor network had been exploited. This possibility was downplayed by Andrew Lewman, a representative of the not-for-profit Tor project, suggesting that execution of traditional police work such as following Bitcoins was more likely. Lewman suggested that such claims were \"overblown\" and that the authorities wanted to simply give the impression they had \"cracked\" Tor to deter others from using it for criminal purposes. A representative of Europol was secretive about the method used, saying: \"This is something we want to keep for ourselves. The way we do this, we can’t share with the whole world, because we want to do it again and again and again.\"\n\nIt has been speculated that hidden services could have been deanonymized if law enforcement replicated the research by CERT at Carnegie Mellon University up until the July 30th patch to mitigate the issue. If sufficient relay nodes were DDOSed, an attacker could perform traffic confirmation attacks in conjunction with a Sybil attack, by forcing traffic to route over law enforcement controlled nodes, a theory partially supported by logs released by the administrator of Doxbin. Court documents released in November 2015 generated serious research ethics concerns in the Tor and security research communities about the warrantless exploit (which presumably had been active from February 2014 to July 4, 2015). The Tor Project patched the vulnerability and the FBI denied having paid Carnegie Mellon $1 million to exploit it. Carnegie Mellon also denied receiving money.\n"}

In 1965 the University of Chicago Law School awarded him a Master of Comparative Law. Peter Schlechtriem subsequently returned to Freiburg where in 1970 he completed his Habilitation with a substantial book on the relationship between liability in contracts and tort, written under the supervision of Ernst von Caemmerer.\n\nIn 1971 he was offered professorships at both the University of Erlangen and the University of Heidelberg. He accepted the chair in Heidelberg, where he headed the Institute for Foreign and International Private Law. In 1977, he accepted a professorship in Freiburg and became the successor of his academic teacher Ernst von Caemmerer. When being offered a chair by the University of Vienna (Austria) in 1984, he declined.\n\nPeter Schlechtriem's academic work focused on the law of contracts, comparative law and international uniform law. His two textbooks on the German law of contracts, contributions to commentaries and numerous articles have significantly influenced the development of the law in Germany and abroad. His article-by-article commentary on the 1980 Vienna Sales Convention (CISG), published both the German and in English, has been particularly successful. Peter Schlechtriem's writings have been translated into a number of languages.\n\nPeter Schlechtriem served on numerous international commissions. He was a member of the German delegation at the Diplomatic Conference in Vienna that adopted the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods in 1980. During the creation of the new Civil Codes of Estonia, Lithuania, Russia and Slovakia, he acted as a consultant and advisor. Peter Schlechtriem was a member if the Commission for the Reform of the German Law of contracts (Kommission zur Reform des deutschen Schuldrechts) and thus exercised considerable influence on the new general law of contracts and law of sales in force in Germany since 2002. He acted as a member of the German Council on International Private Law, of the UNIDROIT Working Group on the development of the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts 2004, of the Study Group for a European Civil Code and was an Advisor of both the American Law Institute and the National Conference of Commissioners of Uniform State Laws in the United States. \nFrom 1990 until 1997, Peter Schlechtriem was President of the German Gesellschaft für Rechtsvergleichung.

It includes a range of behavior from mild irritation and annoyances to serious abuses which can even involve forced activity beyond the boundaries of the job description. Power harassment is considered a form of illegal discrimination and is a form of political and psychological abuse, and bullying.\n\nAlthough the phenomenon power harassment is not uniquely Japanese, since it has occurred in many environments, the term is a Japanese coinage. It has received significant attention in Japan in recent years as a workplace problem. For many Japanese, the only kind of management style they have ever experienced is one in which subordinates are treated harshly and no complaints are tolerated. This makes the nightmare boss seem normal, and those who have never had a different role model for management style find themselves falling back on the old methods. And indeed, many Japanese admire authoritarian bosses, finding them to be strong and admiring their \"passion\" that may be expressed in angry outbursts. The term itself was coined by Yasuko Okada in 2002 and is used mainly in Japan. It is analogous to \"abuse of authority\" or rankism in the workplace. Yuichiro Makiguchi is one of the researchers of power harassment at Tokoha Gakuen Junior College in Japan.\n\nThe topic of power harassment is known in South Korea as Gabjil, and it has been recently increasingly discussed in Korean media and scholarly works.\n\nMany workers are forced by their superiors to perform tasks outside of their job description and working hours. It is common for workers to be fired or suffer severe repercussions if they do not satisfy their superior's orders, despite there being no justifiable basis for such orders. \nSituations exist where employees are treated in a manner that far oversteps the bounds of what is proper between a boss and his or her workers. Someone in a position of power should never be allowed to exercise the power in a bullying or discriminatory fashion. This can create an unhappy and unsafe work environment not just for those being harassed but for the entire work force. \nTypical examples of power harassment include: \n\n"}

Canada, the United Kingdom, all the Scandinavian countries, Germany, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Israel, Australia, and New Zealand currently have PLR programmes. There is ongoing debate in France about implementing one. There is also a move towards having a Europe-wide PLR programme administered by the European Union.\n\nThe first PLR programme was initiated in Denmark in 1941. However, it was not properly implemented until 1946 due to World War II. The idea spread slowly from country to country and many nations' PLR programs are quite recent developments.\n\nPLR programmes vary from country to country. Some, like Germany and the Netherlands, have linked PLR to copyright legislation and have made libraries liable to pay authors for every book in their collection. Other countries do not connect PLR to copyright. For a nation like Canada or Australia the majority of funds would be going to authors outside the country, much of it to the United States, which is unpalatable to those nations.\n\nIn Denmark, the current programme is considered a type of governmental support of the arts, not reimbursement of potential lost sales. Types of works supported are books, music, and visual artworks, created and published in Denmark, and available in public and school libraries.\n\nHow amounts of payment are determined also varies from country to country. Some pay based on how many times a book has been taken out of a library, others use a simpler system of payment based simply on whether a library owns a book or not.\n\nThe amount of payments is also variable. The amount any one author can receive is never very considerable. In Canada for instance the payment is C$38.30 per book per library, with a maximum of C$2,681 (in 2008) for any one author in a year. In the United Kingdom authors are paid on a per-loan basis calculated from a representative sample of libraries. The current rate is 7.82 pence per individual loan.\n\nDifferent countries also have differing eligibility criteria. In most nations only published works are accepted, government publications are rarely counted, nor are bibliographies or dictionaries. Some PLR services are mandated solely to fund literary works of fiction, and some such as Norway, have a sliding scale paying far less to non-fiction works. Many nations also exclude scholarly and academic texts.\n\nWithin the European Union, the public lending right is regulated since November 1992 by directive 92/100/EEC on rental right and lending right. A report in 2002 from the European Commission pointed out that many member countries had failed to implement this directive correctly.\n\nThe PLR directive has met with resistance from the side of the International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA). The IFLA has stated that the principles of 'lending right' can jeopardize free access to the services of publicly accessible libraries, which is the citizen's human right. The PLR directive and its implementation in public libraries is rejected by a number of European authors, including Nobel Laureates Dario Fo and José Saramago. Conversely, more than 3000 authors signed a petition opposing PLR cuts in 2010.\n\n"}

The Act was in place on 25 November 1915 with its restrictions retrospectively in place from 4 August 1914.\n\nThe Act was, in part, a result of a rent strike which had taken place in Glasgow between 1914–15 as landlords sought to capitalise on the large influx of people into Glasgow that the promise of war and munitions work had brought into Glasgow. At its peak the rent strike involved as many as 20,000 people with its influence extending to other working-class communities in the UK. The crisis of the rent strike was brought to a head when Mr. Nicholson, a factor in the Partick area of the city, sought the prosecution of eighteen strikers in the small debt court. On 17 November 1915, thousands of shipyard workers came out on strike and alongside what had become known as \"Mrs Barbour's Army\" descended on the court in Brunswick Place, Glasgow. Despite the possibility of further industrial unrest disrupting the supply of war munitions, the factor insisted on pursuing the case. Only when it was revealed that David Lloyd George had telephoned Nicholson's solicitor urging the prosecution to wait on the findings of a parliamentary Commission of Inquiry was the prosecution dropped. Within a month of the court case the Rent Restrictions Act was in place, and was designed to stop landlords from profiteering during the war years when housing demand was high and supply was low.\n\nThe act was divided into five sections:\n\nThe Act was initially intended as a temporary measure lasting during the continuance of the war and for a period of until six months after the end of the war. although certain sections were not actually repealed until 1989 when rents were deregulated during the third term of Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government.\n"}
{"id": "8748788", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8748788", "title": "Renunciation of citizenship", "text": "Renunciation of citizenship\n\nRenunciation is the voluntary act of relinquishing one's citizenship or nationality. It is the opposite of naturalization–whereby a person voluntarily acquires a citizenship, and is distinct from denaturalization–where the loss of citizenship is forced by a state.\n\nThe common law doctrine of perpetual allegiance denied an individual the right to renounce obligations to his sovereign. The bonds of subjecthood were conceived in principle to be both singular and immutable. These practices held on in varying ways until the late 19th century.\n\nThe refusal of many states to recognize expatriation became problematic for the United States, which had a large immigrant population. The War of 1812 was caused partly by Britain's impressment of U.S. citizens born in the UK into the British Royal Navy. Immigrants to the U.S. were sometimes held to the obligations of their foreign citizenship when they visited their home countries. In response, the U.S. government passed the Expatriation Act of 1868 and concluded various treaties, the Bancroft Treaties, recognizing the right to renounce one's citizenship.\n\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights lists both the right to leave any country, including one's own (Article 13(2)) and the right to change one's nationality (Article 15(2)), which implicitly recognizes the right to renounce citizenship.\n\nRenunciation of citizenship is particularly relevant in cases of multiple citizenship, given that additional citizenships may be acquired automatically and may be undesirable. Many countries have pragmatic policies that recognize the often arbitrary nature of citizenship claims of other countries and negative consequences, such as loss of security clearance, can mostly be expected only for actively exercising foreign citizenship, for instance by obtaining a foreign passport. People from some countries renounce their citizenship to avoid compulsory military service. However, some people may wish to be free even of the purely theoretical obligations and appearance of dual loyalty that another citizenship implies. Even in countries that allow dual citizenship, such as Australia, Jamaica and Pakistan, electoral laws demand that politicians not be under an obligation of allegiance to any foreign country, and so when politicians have been found to be violating such laws, they stepped down and renounced their other citizenships in response to the public controversy. Another example may be political refugees who would wish to renounce allegiance to the country from which they escaped. \n\nEach country sets its own policies for formal renunciation of citizenship. There is a common concern that individuals about to relinquish their citizenship do not become a stateless person and many countries require evidence of another citizenship or an official promise to grant citizenship before they release that person from citizenship. Some countries may not allow or do not recognize renunciation of citizenship or establish administrative procedures that are essentially impossible to complete.\n\nMexico requires renunciation of all other citizenships as a condition of naturalization.\n\nIsrael allows dual citizenship upon naturalization through the Law of Return, but Knesset (Israeli parliament) members are required to renounce all foreign citizenships.\n\nRenunciation of citizenship is most straightforward in those countries which recognize and strictly enforce a single citizenship. Thus, voluntary naturalization in another country is considered as \"giving up\" of one's previous citizenship or implicit renunciation. For practical reasons, such an automatic renunciation cannot officially take place until the authorities of the original country are informed about the naturalization. In Japan, a formal report is required from the renouncing person to be submitted at an embassy. Germany actively investigates whether its citizens living abroad have naturalized there when they apply for a passport; for instance in Canada, German passport applicants have to submit a search of citizenship record. Canada and Australia are signatories to the United Nations Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness, and renunciation is possible only if it will not result in statelessness. Applications for renunciation of citizenship need to be submitted in those countries with a waiting time of several months until approval.\n\nThe right to renounce Nigerian citizenship is established in § 29 of the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria, which states that \"any citizen of Nigeria of full age who wishes to renounce his/her Nigerian citizenship shall make a declaration in the prescribed manner for the renunciation\", which the government is obliged to register except when Nigeria is physically involved in a war or when the President of Nigeria is of the opinion that the renunciation is contrary to public policy. Under § 29(4)(a), a person of either gender becomes \"of full age\" at eighteen years, while under § 29(4)(b) a girl younger than that is still deemed to be \"of full age\" if she is married.\n\nIn 2013, the Senate of Nigeria proposed a constitutional amendment to delete § 29(4)(b), which would have the effect that girls could only renounce Nigerian citizenship at the age of eighteen or older regardless of their marital status; the amendment passed by a vote of 75–14, two votes greater than the two-thirds supermajority required for the passage of constitutional amendments. However, after the vote, a point of order was raised against the amendment by Senate Deputy Minority Leader Ahmad Sani Yerima (ANPP-Zamfara), who stated that Schedule 2 of the Constitution prohibited the National Assembly of Nigeria from legislating on any matters relating to customary or Islamic law. Some sources suggested that the amendment would have the effect of outlawing child marriage, a matter of personal concern to Yerima due to his 2009 marriage to an Egyptian girl then only 13 years old. Senate President David Mark was initially disinclined to permit a second vote on the matter, but relented after an argument. Yerima's arguments were sufficient to convince enough erstwhile supporters and non-voters to oppose the amendment; with a vote of 60–35, it was deprived of its supermajority and failed to pass.\n\nCitizens of Singapore can only renounce Singaporean citizenship if they have acquired citizenship of another country. At the time of renunciation, renunciants must submit their Singaporean passports and National Registration Identity Cards for cancellation. Male Singaporeans generally cannot renounce citizenship until completing military service, though there are exceptions for those who emigrated at a young age (generally those who were not educated in Singapore). In 2012, a Hong Kong-born man who had acquired Singaporean citizenship by registration while a minor filed a lawsuit regarding this requirement.\n\nAbout 1,200 Singaporean citizens renounce their citizenship every year, a quarter of them naturalised citizens. Singapore does not permit multiple citizenship for adults. The total number of renunciants from 2001 to 2011 was roughly 10,900. Of these, roughly half were Chinese Singaporeans (who comprise about three-quarters of the population), while the rest were of other ethnicities such as Malay or Indians (who comprise about one-quarter of the population).\n\nAlthough renunciation may be the most commonly used term when referring to loss of U.S. nationality, renunciation is only one of the seven expatriating acts that may be performed voluntarily and with the intent to relinquish U.S. nationality stated in Section 349 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 ().\n\nUnited States law requires that an individual appear in person before a consular officer at a U.S. embassy or consulate outside the United States and sign an oath or affirmation that the individual intends to renounce U.S. citizenship. Exceptions to this rule are permitted in times of war and under special circumstances. During the expatriation procedure, the individual must complete several documents and demonstrate in an interview with a consular officer that the renunciation is voluntary and intentional. Depending on the embassy or consulate, the individual is often required to appear in person two times and conduct two separate interviews with consular officers over the course of several months.\n\nThere were 235 renunciants in 2008, between 731 and 743 in 2009, and about 1485 in 2010; In 2011, there were 1781 renunciants. A total of 2,999 Americans renounced their citizenship in 2012-2013; in 2014, 3415 have renounced their USA citizenship or long term residency. The State Department estimates 5986 renunciants and 559 relinquishers during FY2015.\n\nSince 1998, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has also maintained its own list of people who have renounced citizenship under . This is one of the categories of people who are prohibited from purchasing firearms under the Gun Control Act of 1968, and whose names must be entered in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) under the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993. The names are not made public, but each month the FBI issues a report on the number of entries added in each category. NICS covers a different population than the \"Federal Register\" expatriate list: the former includes only those who renounce U.S. citizenship, while the latter should include those who voluntarily lose citizenship by any means, and possibly certain former permanent residents as well.\n\nIn fiscal year 2015, the State Department estimated there were 5,986 applications for renunciation of nationality, and forecast an additional 559 citizenship relinquishments. The discrepancy between this total of 6,545 compared to the 4,279 announced by the Treasury Department is speculated to be at least partly due to different counting of long-term green card holders, but no department of the government has released an official explanation.\n\nIn 2016, the Treasury Department published 1,151 names of people who expatriated in Q1 FY2016. For all of the year 2016, the published number of renunciants was 5,411, a 26% increase from 4,279 in 2015—a record high.\n\nA summary of the difference between the NICS database of renunciants and the Federal Register of the mentioned renunciants and relinquishers of long-term residence status is summarized below.\n\nFormal confirmation of the loss of U.S. citizenship is provided by the Certificate of Loss of Nationality (CLN) and is received by the renunciant a number of months later.\n\nAs recently as November 2014, individuals renouncing US citizenship waited up to 6 months for the official certificate of renunciation, while many renunciants, particularly those who renounced in consulates not located in the most common European cities such as London and Zurich, were never provided with a CLN and were told that the statement signed at the oath of renunciation is the only form given. Unofficial statements by the US State Department ascribe the problems to the fact that before 2010, the system was not efficiently designed and consular officers often improvised their own procedures based on the rough guidelines in their instructions. Since the passage of FATCA, the large increase in renunciations led the Department of State to re-organize the process so it is clear and follows the same steps in all consulates, although as of 2016, a backlog of several months still exists in many consulates.\n\nAlthough many countries require citizenship of another nation before allowing renunciation, the United States does not, and an individual may legally renounce U.S. citizenship and become stateless. Nonetheless, the United States Department of State warns renunciants that, unless they already possess a foreign nationality or are assured of acquiring another nationality shortly after completing their renunciation, they would become stateless and without the protection of any government.\n\nIn one case, Vincent Cate, an encryption expert living in Anguilla, chose to renounce his US citizenship to avoid the possibility of violating US laws that may have prohibited US citizens from \"exporting\" encryption software.\n\nRenunciation of U.S. citizenship was free until July 2010, at which time a fee of $450 was established. An increase to $2,350, effective September 12, 2014, was justified as \"reflective of the true cost\" of processing. This followed a fee increase of approximately 220% in 2013. The increase took effect in January 2015.\nOn October 26, 2015 Forbes reported that during 2014, American dual citizens in Canada who were trying to renounce their U.S. citizenship created a backlog at the U.S. Consulate in Toronto.\n\nPeople giving up U.S. citizenship may be subject to an expatriation tax. Originally, under the Foreign Investors Tax Act of 1966, people determined to be giving up citizenship for the purpose of avoiding U.S. taxation were subject to 10 years of continued taxation on their U.S.-source income, to prevent ex-citizens from taking advantage of special tax incentives offered to foreigners investing in the United States.\n\nIn 1996, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act included various changes to the tax treatment of people who give up U.S. citizenship. First, it defined concrete criteria to determine whether an ex-citizen or ex-permanent resident was a \"covered expatriate\" presumed to have given up U.S. status for tax reasons, based on the person's income and assets, or inability to certify compliance with their tax filing and payment obligations for the past five years (). Second, it required the Department of the Treasury to \"name and shame\" people who give up U.S. citizenship by listing their names in the Quarterly Publication of Individuals Who Have Chosen to Expatriate in the \"Federal Register\" (. The list does not appear to contain the names of all people who give up U.S. citizenship. though tax lawyers disagree whether that is because the list is only required to contain \"covered expatriates\", or due to bureaucratic errors or other reasons. Names of those renouncing in the last months of the year will mostly appear on the list before they have filed IRS form 8854 establishing covered or non-covered status, so it does not seem possible that the list is only required to contain covered expatriates. \n\nAdditionally, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 included a provision, the Reed Amendment (), to bar entry to any individual \"who officially renounces United States citizenship and who is determined by the Attorney General to have renounced United States citizenship for the purpose of avoiding taxation by the United States\". However, former IRS lawyers, as well as the Department of Homeland Security, have indicated that the provision is unenforceable because there is no authority for the IRS to share tax return information to enforce it. DHS stated that they can only enforce the Reed Amendment when former U.S. citizens \"affirmatively admit to renouncing their U.S. citizenship for the purpose of avoiding U.S. taxation\", and between 2002 and 2015 they denied entry to only two former U.S. citizens on the basis of the amendment.\n\nIn 2008, Congress enacted the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Act, which changed the expatriation tax to a one-time mark-to-market worldwide capital gains tax rather than ten years of taxation on U.S.-source income. Effective June 2008, U.S. citizens who renounce their citizenship are subject under certain circumstances to an expatriation tax, which is meant to extract, from the expatriate, taxes that would have been paid had he or she remained a citizen. All property of a covered expatriate is deemed sold for its fair market value on the day before the expatriation date, which usually results in a capital gain, which is taxable income. Eduardo Saverin, a Brazilian-born co-founder of Facebook, renounced his U.S. citizenship just before the company's expected initial public offering. The timing prompted media speculation that the act was motivated by potential U.S. tax obligations.\n\nSince the enactment of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) of 2010, the numbers of people renouncing US citizenship have broken new records each year, increasing from a few hundred per year before FATCA to 5,411 in 2016. In the first two quarters of 2017 alone, 3,072 people renounced, which exceeds the full year total for 2013. In 2016, there were about 18 times more renunciations than in 2008, and the 2017 quarter 2 total (1,759) is more than 76 times that of quarter 2 in 2008 (23). Renunciants have reported that they feel forced to renounce under duress caused by FATCA but are prevented from saying this when renouncing.\n"}
{"id": "296728", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=296728", "title": "Ronald Dworkin", "text": "Ronald Dworkin\n\nRonald Myles Dworkin, FBA (; December 11, 1931 – February 14, 2013) was an American philosopher, jurist, and scholar of United States constitutional law. At the time of his death, he was Frank Henry Sommer Professor of Law and Philosophy at New York University and Professor of Jurisprudence at University College London. Dworkin had taught previously at Yale Law School and the University of Oxford, where he was the Professor of Jurisprudence, successor to renowned philosopher H. L. A. Hart. An influential contributor to both philosophy of law and political philosophy, Dworkin received the 2007 Holberg International Memorial Prize in the Humanities for \"his pioneering scholarly work\" of \"worldwide impact.\" According to a survey in \"The Journal of Legal Studies\", Dworkin was the second most-cited American legal scholar of the twentieth century. After his death, the Harvard legal scholar Cass Sunstein said Dworkin was \"one of the most important legal philosophers of the last 100 years. He may well head the list.\"\n\nHis theory of law as integrity as presented in his book titled \"Law's Empire\", in which judges interpret the law in terms of consistent moral principles, especially justice and fairness, is among the most influential contemporary theories about the nature of law. Dworkin advocated a \"moral reading\" of the United States Constitution, and an interpretivist approach to law and morality. He was a frequent commentator on contemporary political and legal issues, particularly those concerning the Supreme Court of the United States, often in the pages of \"The New York Review of Books\".\n\nRonald Dworkin was born in 1931 in Providence, Rhode Island, United States, the son of Madeline (Talamo) and David Dworkin. His family was Jewish. He graduated from Harvard University in 1953 with an A.B. \"summa cum laude\", then attended Magdalen College, Oxford, where he was a Rhodes Scholar and a student of Sir Rupert Cross and J.H.C. Morris. After he completed his final year's exams at Oxford, the examiners were so impressed with his script that the Professor of Jurisprudence (then H. L. A. Hart) was summoned to read it. He was awarded a B.A. with a Congratulatory first. Dworkin then attended Harvard Law School, graduating in 1957 with an LL.B \"magna cum laude\". He then clerked for Judge Learned Hand of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Judge Hand would later call Dworkin \"the law clerk to beat all law clerks\"—and Dworkin would recall Judge Hand as an enormously influential mentor.\n\nAfter clerking for Judge Learned Hand, Dworkin was offered the opportunity to clerk for Justice Felix Frankfurter. He turned down the offer and joined Sullivan & Cromwell, a prominent law firm in New York City. After working at the firm, Dworkin became a Professor of Law at Yale Law School, where he became the holder of the Wesley N. Hohfeld Chair of Jurisprudence.\n\nIn 1969, Dworkin was appointed to the Chair of Jurisprudence at Oxford, a position in which he succeeded H. L. A. Hart (who remembered Dworkins's Oxford examination and promoted his candidacy) and was elected Fellow of University College, Oxford. After retiring from Oxford, Dworkin became the Quain Professor of Jurisprudence at University College London, where he subsequently became the Bentham Professor of Jurisprudence. He was Frank Henry Sommer Professor of Law at New York University School of Law and professor of Philosophy at New York University (NYU), where he taught since the late 1970s. He co-taught a colloquium in legal, political, and social philosophy with Thomas Nagel. Dworkin had regularly contributed, for several decades, to \"The New York Review of Books\". He delivered the Oliver Wendell Holmes Lecture at Harvard, the Storrs Lectures at Yale, the Tanner Lectures on Human Values at Stanford, and the Scribner Lectures at Princeton. In June 2011, he joined the professoriate of New College of the Humanities, a private college in London.\n\nDworkin as a critic of HLA Hart's legal positivism has been summarized by the \"Stanford Encyclopedia\" which has stated that:\nDworkin, as positivism's most significant critic, rejects the positivist theory on every conceivable level. Dworkin denies that there can be any general theory of the existence and content of law; he denies that local theories of particular legal systems can identify law without recourse to its moral merits, and he rejects the whole institutional focus of positivism. A theory of law is for Dworkin a theory of how cases ought to be decided and it begins, not with an account of the political organization of a legal system, but with an abstract ideal regulating the conditions under which governments may use coercive force over their subjects.\nDworkin is most famous for his critique of Hart's legal positivism; he sets forth the fullest statement of his critique in his book \"Law's Empire\". Dworkin's theory is 'interpretive': the law is whatever follows from a constructive interpretation of the institutional history of the legal system.\n\nDworkin argues that moral principles that people hold dear are often wrong, even to the extent that certain crimes are acceptable if one's principles are skewed enough. To discover and apply these principles, courts interpret the legal data (legislation, cases etc.) with a view to articulating an interpretation that best explains and justifies past legal practice. All interpretation must follow, Dworkin argues, from the notion of \"law as integrity\" to make sense.\n\nOut of the idea that law is 'interpretive' in this way, Dworkin argues that in every situation where people's legal rights are controversial, the best interpretation involves the right answer thesis, the thesis that there exists a right answer as a matter of law that the judge must discover. Dworkin opposes the notion that judges have a discretion in such difficult cases.\n\nDworkin's model of legal principles is also connected with Hart's notion of the Rule of Recognition. Dworkin rejects Hart's conception of a master rule in every legal system that identifies valid laws, on the basis that this would entail that the process of identifying law must be uncontroversial, whereas (Dworkin argues) people have legal rights even in cases where the correct legal outcome is open to reasonable dispute.\n\nDworkin moves away from positivism's separation of law and morality, since constructive interpretation implicates moral judgments in every decision about what the law is.\n\nDespite their intellectual disagreements, Hart and Dworkin \"remained on good terms.\"\n\nIn Dworkin's own words, his \"right answer thesis\" may be interpreted through the following words:\nSuppose the legislature has passed a statute stipulating that \"sacrilegious contracts shall henceforth be invalid.\" The community is divided as to whether a contract signed on Sunday is, for that reason alone, sacrilegious. It is known that very few of the legislators had that question in mind when they voted, and that they are now equally divided on the question of whether it should be so interpreted. Tom and Tim have signed a contract on Sunday, and Tom now sues Tim to enforce the terms of the contract, whose validity Tim contests. Shall we say that the judge must look for the right answer to the question of whether Tom's contract is valid, even though the community is deeply divided about what the right answer is? Or is it more realistic to say that there simply is no right answer to the question?\n\nOne of Dworkin's most interesting and controversial theses states that the law as properly interpreted will give an answer. This is not to say that everyone will have the same answer (a consensus of what is \"right\"), or if it did, the answer would not be justified exactly in the same way for every person; rather it means that there will be a necessary answer for each individual if he applies himself correctly to the legal question. For the correct method is that encapsulated by the metaphor of Judge Hercules, an ideal judge, immensely wise and with full knowledge of legal sources. Hercules (the name comes from a classical mythological hero) would also have plenty of time to decide. Acting on the premise that the law is a seamless web, Hercules is required to construct the theory that best fits and justifies the law as a whole (law as integrity) in order to decide any particular case. Hercules, Dworkin argues, would always come to the one right answer.\n\nDworkin does not deny that competent lawyers often disagree on what is the solution to a given case. On the contrary, he claims that they are disagreeing about \"the\" right answer to the case, the answer Hercules would give.\n\nDworkin's critics argue not only that \"law proper\" (that is, the legal sources in a positivist sense) is full of gaps and inconsistencies, but also that other legal standards (including principles) may be insufficient to solve a hard case. Some of them are incommensurable. In any of these situations, even Hercules would be in a dilemma and none of the possible answers would be the \"right\" one.\n\nDworkin's metaphor of judge Hercules bears some resemblance to Rawls' veil of ignorance and Habermas' ideal speech situation, in that they all suggest idealized methods of arriving at somehow valid normative propositions. The key difference with respect to the former is that Rawls' veil of ignorance translates almost seamlessly from the purely ideal to the practical. In relation to politics in a democratic society, for example, it is a way of saying that those in power should treat the political opposition consistently with how they would like to be treated when in opposition, because their present position offers no guarantee as to what their position will be in the political landscape of the future (i.e. they will inevitably form the opposition at some point). Dworkin's Judge Hercules, on the other hand, is a purely idealized construct, that is \"if\" such a figure existed, he would arrive at a right answer in every moral dilemma. For a critique along these lines see Lorenzo Zucca's \"Constitutional Dilemmas\".\n\nDworkin's right answer thesis turns on the success of his attack on the skeptical argument that right answers in legal-moral dilemmas cannot be determined. Dworkin's anti-skeptical argument is essentially that the properties of the skeptic's claim are analogous to those of substantive moral claims, that is, in asserting that the truth or falsity of \"legal-moral\" dilemmas cannot be determined, the skeptic makes not a metaphysical claim about the way things are, but a \"moral\" claim to the effect that it is, in the face of epistemic uncertainty, unjust to determine legal-moral issues to the detriment of any given individual.\n\nIn her recent book on Hans Kelsen, Sandrine Baume identified Ronald Dworkin as a leading defender of the \"compatibility of judicial review with the very principles of democracy.\" Baume identified John Hart Ely alongside Dworkin as the foremost defenders of this principle in recent years, while the opposition to this principle of \"compatibility\" was identified as Bruce Ackerman and Jeremy Waldron. Dworkin has been a long-time advocate of the principle of the moral reading of the Constitution whose lines of support he sees as strongly associated with enhanced versions of judicial review in the federal government.\n\nDworkin has also made important contributions to what is sometimes called the \"equality of what\" debate. In a famous pair of articles and his book \"Sovereign Virtue\" he advocates a theory he calls 'equality of resources'. This theory combines two key ideas. Broadly speaking, the first is that human beings are responsible for the life choices they make. The second is that natural endowments of intelligence and talent are morally arbitrary and ought not to affect the distribution of resources in society. Like the rest of Dworkin's work, his theory of equality is underpinned by the core principle that every person is entitled to equal concern and respect in the design of the structure of society. Dworkin's theory of equality is said to be one variety of so-called luck egalitarianism, but he rejects this statement (\"Philosophy and Public Affairs\", v. 31: 2).\n\nIn the essay \"Do Values Conflict? A Hedgehog's Approach\" (\"Arizona Law Review\", Vol 43:2), Dworkin contends that the values of liberty and equality do not necessarily conflict. He criticizes Isaiah Berlin's conception of liberty as \"flat\" and proposes a new, \"dynamic\" conception of liberty, suggesting that one cannot say that one's liberty is infringed when one is prevented from committing murder. Thus, liberty cannot be said to have been infringed when no wrong has been done. Put in this way, liberty is only liberty to do whatever we wish so long as we do not infringe upon the rights of others.\n\nWhile working for Judge Learned Hand, Dworkin met his future wife, Betsy Ross, with whom he would have twins Anthony and Jennifer. Betsy was the daughter of a successful New York businessman. They were married from 1958 until Betsy died of cancer in 2000. Dworkin later married Irene Brendel, the former wife of pianist Alfred Brendel.\n\nDworkin died of leukemia in London on February 14, 2013 at the age of 81. He is survived by his second wife, two children, and two grandchildren.\n\nIn September 2007, Dworkin was awarded the Holberg International Memorial Prize. The award citation of the Holberg Prize Academic Committee recognized that Dworkin has \"elaborated a liberal egalitarian theory\" and stressed Dworkin's effort to develop \"an original and highly influential legal theory grounding law in morality, characterized by a unique ability to tie together abstract philosophical ideas and arguments with concrete everyday concerns in law, morals, and politics\".\n\nThe New York University Annual Survey of American Law honored Dworkin with its 2006 dedication.\n\nIn 2006, the Legal Research Institute of the National Autonomous University of Mexico honored Dworkin with the International Prize of legal Research \"Dr. Héctor Fix-Zamudio\".\n\nIn June 2000, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Pennsylvania. In June 2009, he was awarded an honorary doctorate of law by Harvard University. In August 2011, the University of Buenos Aires awarded Dworkin an honorary doctorate. The resolution noted that he \"has tirelessly defended the rule of law, democracy and human rights.\" These were among a number of honorary doctorates conferred upon him.\n\nOn November 14, 2012, he received the Balzan Prize for Jurisprudence in Quirinale Palace, Rome, from the President of the Italian Republic. The Balzan Prize was awarded \"for his fundamental contributions to Jurisprudence, characterized by outstanding originality and clarity of thought in a continuing and fruitful interaction with ethical and political theories and with legal practices\".\n\nHe was an honorary Queen's Counsel (QC).\n\n\n\n\n"}

Scientific jury selection is used during the jury selection phase of the trial, during which lawyers have the opportunity to question jurors. It almost always entails an expert's assistance in the attorney's use of peremptory challenges—the right to reject a certain number of potential jurors without stating a reason—during jury selection. The practice is currently confined to the American legal system.\n\nScientific jury selection is based on the work of Fred L. Strotbeck, the research director on the American Juries Project headed by Harry Kalvin, Jr and Hans Zeisel. He considered juries to be small groups and taped mock juries in Chicago and St. Louis and actual juries in Wichita, Kansas with the permission of the attorneys and judge but not the jurors. The study revealed that the characteristics of individual jurors influenced jury deliberations.\n\nSJS has roots in criminal trials during the Vietnam War era, but in modern times is usually employed in high-stakes civil litigation (where only money is usually at issue, in contrast to criminal trials, where the defendant can go to prison). SJS practitioners determine what background characteristics and attitudes predict favorable results, and then coordinate with attorneys in choosing the jury. Studies are mixed as to the effectiveness of the practice, though it is clear that the evidence presented at trial is the most important determiner of verdicts (the trial result) and that SJS is more likely to have an impact where that evidence is ambiguous. SJS's potential to unfairly skew the jury has led to some reform proposals, but none have yet been implemented. The limited fictional portrayals of SJS have been negative towards the practice.\n\n[|Former Attorney General Ramsey Clark rated jurors and led the discussion among defendants, attorneys, and social scientists about jury selection in the Harrisburg Seven case.]]\n\nDuring jury selection in the United States, attorneys have two options for excluding potential jurors. The first option is a \"challenge for cause\", in which attorneys must state the reason for a challenge (such as clear bias or a conflict of interest), the opposing party is allowed to respond, and the judge decides whether to exclude the juror. The second option is a peremptory challenge, where an attorney can exclude a juror without stating any reason. While challenges for cause are unlimited, attorneys have a limited number of peremptory challenges, sometimes as few as four, although 10 is more common in non-capital felony cases.\n\nAttorneys have long used peremptory challenges to exclude \"undesirable\" prospective jurors, but have not always been successful at identifying these. Much of the early efforts were based on lawyers' folklore about who makes a good juror for their case. Early examples of scientific jury selection were similar. For example, in the 1975 Joan Little trial, defense attorneys used an astrologer to help choose the jury. More rigorous methodology was on display during the first major use of SJS, the 1972 Harrisburg Seven trial. During that trial, social scientists used demographic characteristics to identify biases in favor of conviction. The consultants in the case had conducted surveys that indicated women and Democrats would make defense-friendly jurors, and the religious, those with college degrees, and \"Reader's Digest\" subscribers would be better for the prosecution. Although surveys had indicated that 80% of citizens in conservative Harrisburg, Pennsylvania would convict the defendants, they were acquitted of all serious charges.\nA jury consultant helped pick the jury in the O. J. Simpson murder trial. Criminologist Jo-Ellan Dimitrius used surveys to determine the ideal defense juror demographic (black women) and analyzed and judged the prospective jurors' answers to a questionnaire and response and body language during voir dire (the stage of jury selection where lawyers are permitted to directly question the jury). Prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi gives more credit to the traditional change of venue. He argues that transferring the case to a section of Los Angeles with more blacks in the jury pool was most detrimental to the selection of a prosecution-friendly jury. The prosecutor dismissed her court-appointed jury consultant early in the process.\n\nContemporary jury consultants are often sociologists, people with experience in communications and marketing, or attorneys themselves, but they are most frequently psychologists who specialize in legal psychology. Although most of the practice's roots are in criminal trials, modern jury consultants are more often involved in torts (civil litigation), particularly where wealthy corporate defendants fear an enormous monetary judgment for the plaintiff, or where plaintiffs’ attorneys have invested large sums of money in an important lawsuit. Since the 1980s, large jury and trial consulting firms have emerged, earning multi-million dollar revenues, mostly from such high-stakes civil litigation. The simultaneous shift from ad-hoc groups of academics to a business model has sparked the criticism that SJS magnifies the distorting effect money has on trials, since only the wealthy can afford it. Jury consultants argue that they operate in an adversarial process the same way lawyers do; by pursuing their clients' interests in a rule-bound framework. Jeffrey Abramson, who has written extensively about juries, argues that even if SJS is ethical or has zero effect, the mere myth of powerful, effective jury manipulators shakes public confidence in the jury system.\n\nThe theory behind SJS is that juror attitudes predict voting preferences most effectively. By discovering what relationships exist between certain attitudes, attorneys can exclude those from the jury whose attitudes would predispose them to an unfavorable verdict.\nResearcher Shari Diamond indicates that jury consultants primarily rely on two methods: telephone surveys and mock trials (trial simulations). Telephone surveys are the practitioners' \"primary research method\". During a survey of the community where the trial is taking place, jury consultants ask about:\n\nDiamond writes that jury consultants then compare the three data sets to determine which background characteristics correlate to favorable attitudes and verdicts, and which attitudes correlate to favorable verdicts. Attorneys can then use that information to select favorable jurors, based either on prospective jurors' characteristics or whatever an attorney can learn about jurors' attitudes. This has prompted the most frequent criticism of SJS: that consultants stack juries with favorably biased or credulous jurors; in turn, practitioners insist this is impossible and that bias can only be removed from a jury pool.\n\nAn alternative is to test respondents at the researcher's facility with opening statements or a full-blown mock trial instead of reading a case summary over the telephone. The higher cost of a mock trial allows for a more realistic portrayal of the real trial and (researchers hope) more accurate data. It also provides a better opportunity to question the subjects, before and after the trial simulation. On the other hand, telephone surveys provide a larger and more representative sample of the jury pool. Diamond indicates that since both methods have advantages, SJS practitioners commonly rely on both in the same case.\n\nBesides the occasional astrologer or psychic, a few practitioners use unorthodox methods, such as in-courtroom assessment of posture, pupil dilation, or breathing to judge jurors both during selection and during trial. Though such methods have the veneer of science, psychologists reject them as nonsense and \"science fiction\". Notwithstanding this, Jo-Ellan Dimitrius (from the Simpson trial) indicates that she also relies on appearance, body language, conduct, and even smells such as perfume or medication. She sometimes decides based upon her \"gut feeling\" about a juror.\n\nResearch psychologists Kassin and Wrightsman indicate that the model employed (demographic factors predict attitudes that predict verdicts) has empirical weaknesses. That attitudes predict verdicts is taken for granted and rarely studied. For example, veterans might favor current troops, but that does not necessarily translate into a likelihood to acquit their brethren of crimes. However, the relationship between demographics and verdicts can be more reliably predicted by mock trials. Successful prediction of jury verdicts often requires data specific to the case and jurisdiction. The sheer number of ways that one case can be unique outstrips the published research on the subject, so original research is often required. That necessity is exacerbated by the fact that many modern consultants are reluctant to share knowledge, even with other firms, because of paranoia, client confidentiality, and their regard for their work as \"trade secrets\".\n\nOne important variation is \"group dynamics analysis\". Some jury selection is concerned with the attitudes and bias of individuals. Some trial consultants also try to predict how individuals will form themselves into groups in the jury and which jurors will become leaders and followers in those groups. Consultants also use this tool after jury selection is over.\n\nAlthough advocates and practitioners of scientific jury selection claim the practice is overwhelmingly effective at choosing juries that will render the desired verdict, its true effect is often more difficult to discern. Part of this difficulty is in duplicating the conditions of a real trial. In one experiment, two kinds of shadow juries watched a trial and rendered a verdict. The results indicated that the juries were substantially different, but that this difference was likely due to the two experimental juries’ knowledge that they were not deciding an actual verdict, prompting a lower burden of proof.\n\nAnother simplified experiment indicated that lawyers trained in a systematic selection method made better predictions of juror verdicts in two of four cases – the sale of illegal drugs and a military court-martial (the other two cases were murder and drunk driving). The systematic method was more effective in those two cases where the predictive relationships between demographic variables and attitudes/verdicts were strongest, and least effective where such predictive relationships were weak or nonexistent.\n\nSome academic researchers argue that the actual efficacy of SJS is obscured by poor research methodology. Specifically, demographic characteristics used to predict juror attitudes and juror verdicts may not hold true across all types of cases. For example, men convict more frequently than women in some types of criminal trials but less frequently in others. Besides this, demographic characteristics are often less predictive than the attitudes jurors hold; for example, attitudes towards rape are better verdict-predictors than gender in rape trials.\n\nThe actual efficacy of jury consultants may not be very important because the demographic composition of the jury has little effect on the verdict it renders, usually causing only a 5%–15% variance in verdicts. The evidence presented at trial has far more impact on what the verdict will be. As Kressel and Kressel indicate, \"when the evidence is strong, nothing else matters much\" and even when the evidence is ambiguous, demographic characteristics of jurors are a relatively minor influence. Some researchers argue that a significant improvement in jury selection, however small, may be worthwhile when the stakes are high, as with a defendant accused of a capital crime or a corporation that stands to lose millions of dollars in a civil suit.\n\nA popular \"proof is in the pudding\" argument is often made, especially by consultants themselves; the argument goes that since attorneys and clients pay such high fees (sometimes as much as $500,000) for consultants, their services must be effective. Others argue that most attorneys are unaware of the social science research on the topic.\n\nThe effectiveness of scientific jury selection has also been comparison tested against other methods, such as attorney folklore and intuition. For trial attorneys, justifying the expense of SJS is contingent upon an improvement over their own jury selection abilities. Several empirical studies of traditional jury selection (by attorneys acting alone) have indicated that it and SJS are about equally effective.\n\nIn light of the criticisms leveled against scientific jury selection—that it lets lawyers stack juries and increases the influence of money—several reforms have been proposed. One common reform proposal is the elimination of peremptory challenges. Supreme Court precedent already forbids use of peremptories (peremptory challenges) to exclude jurors based solely on their race or sex. Proponents argue that doing away with peremptories altogether will eliminate the perceived and real injustice of permitting lawyers to eliminate jurors dispositionally unfavorable to them without a challenge for cause argument in open court. Opponents counter that attorneys cannot always ferret out actionable evidence of juror bias, particularly in the context of a limited voir dire.\n\nOther proposals include:\n\nDespite serious discussion among lawyers, scholars, legislators, and others about various reform proposals, none have been implemented and no consensus exists about which remedy, if any, would be the most appropriate and effective.\n\nThe major fictional representations to date have largely portrayed jury consultants as villains that are highly effective at influencing the jury, often using illegal tactics that mainstream practitioners do not use. Consultants are major characters in John Grisham's novel \"The Runaway Jury\" and the similar film adaptation. In the film, Rankin Fitch, \"jury consultant for the defense\", leads a team that uses high technology and sometimes-illegal tactics to prevent a judgment against their corporate client in what \"Salon\" calls \"our worst nightmare of corporate arm-twisting\". Writing about the book, Kressel and Kressel say Grisham \"plays on fears that the American justice system has been hijacked by crafty attorneys and immensely effective hired-gun social scientists\". Jean Hanff Korelitz's \"A Jury of Her Peers\" stretches the known reality of consulting much further. Korelitz's fictional consultants are part of an unscrupulous firm that charges prosecutors to kidnap homeless people, program them with drugs into conviction-only jurors, and substitute them for those hoping to avoid jury duty. Jonakait says the novel is \"hardly realistic\" but \"reveals the distrust engendered by jury consultants\".\n\nIn a fifth-season episode of the CBS television series \"Numb3rs\", entitled \"Guilt Trip\", an illegal arms dealer (James Marsters) is tried for racketeering and the murder of the key witness against him. After he is unexpectedly acquitted, the investigation reveals that he had hired a sleazy jury consultant to not only identify those jurors who would most likely sway the rest of the jury's deliberations, so as to bribe and extort them into pushing for acquittal, but also train one of his henchmen to pose as the perfect \"prosecutor's juror\" and get placed on the jury. In season one, episode eleven, of the television series \"Leverage\", a pharmaceutical company is under fire for a wrongful death case involving a stimulative all-natural herbal supplement. In an attempt to prevent major losses for the pharmaceutical company in question, and to protect the investment of a soon-to-be-parent company's subsidiary, scientific jury selection is used. However, the \"Leverage\" team thwarts their efforts every step of the way, similar to a giant chess match.\n\nIn the CBS television show \"Bull\", the lead character operates a trial analysis company, which specializes in utilizing psychological profiles built by observing jurors during voir dire and online profiles to both select the jury and try arguments against mirror jurors. The show is based on the early career of Dr. Phil McGraw.\n\n"}

This is, for example, of importance to the Scottish fishing industry, the North Sea oil industry, and in the competing claims for the resources of the Rockall Trough.\n\nThe territorial waters thus defined as \"not\" being Scottish waters come under the jurisdiction of either English law or Northern Ireland law. Therefore, because it defines the territorial limits of the three separate jurisdictions, it comprises a piece of constitutional law in the constitution of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe law effectively curved the maritime jurisdictional boundary between Scotland and England north. Previously, the boundary was a straight line heading east across the North Sea from Berwick. The movement of the line meant that some oil fields previously in Scottish waters were now under English jurisdiction. Professor Alex Kemp of the University of Aberdeen argued that the movement of the line did not make much difference from an economic perspective, \"because [these] are just a handful of fields, and [no longer] very important ones\".\n\n\n"}

The attack's name was coined in early 2010 by Aza Raskin, a security researcher and design expert. The attack takes advantage of user trust and inattention to detail in regard to tabs, and the ability of browsers to navigate across a page's origin in inactive tabs a long time after the page is loaded. Tabnabbing is different from most phishing attacks in that the user no longer remembers that a certain tab was the result of a link unrelated to the login page, because the fake login page is loaded in one of the long-lived open tabs in their browser.\n\nThe attack causes the browser to navigate to the impersonated page after the page has been left unattended for some time. A user who returns after a while and sees the login page may be induced to believe the page is legitimate and enter their login, password and other details that will be used for improper purposes. The attack can be made more likely to succeed if the attacker is able to check for well known websites the user has loaded in the past or in other tabs, and loads a simulation of the same sites. This attack can be done even if JavaScript is disabled, using the \"meta refresh\" meta element, an HTML attribute used for page redirection that causes a reload of a specified new page after a given time interval.\n\nThe NoScript extension for Mozilla Firefox defends both from the JavaScript-based and from the scriptless attack, based on meta refresh, by preventing inactive tabs from changing the location of the page. Because there are legitimate purposes for inactive tab redirects, it cannot be disabled in all browsers by default without breaking some applications. The attack is also not very common, giving browser vendors little incentive to implement a breaking change.\n\n\"It can detect that you're logged into Citibank right now and Citibank has been training you to log into your account every 15 minutes because it logs you out for better security.

It is a criminal offense in many jurisdictions.\n\nTampering with evidence is closely related to the legal issue of spoliation of evidence, which is usually the civil law or due process version of the same concept (but may itself be a crime). Tampering with evidence is also closely related to obstruction of justice and perverting the course of justice, and these two kinds of crimes are often charged together. The goal of tampering with evidence is usually to cover up a crime.\n\nWhen police confiscate and destroy a citizen's photographs or recordings of officers' misconduct, the police's act of destroying the evidence may be prosecuted as an act of evidence tampering, if the recordings being destroyed are potential evidence in a criminal or regulatory investigation of the officers themselves. In a notable case in Nebraska, officers were charged with the felony charge of evidence tampering, as well as misdemeanor obstruction and theft, when they committed brutality and forcibly stole and destroyed the recordings, which was exposed due to a third party's recording. On the other hand, when police departments lose exonerating evidence that would create reasonable doubt for defendants in the cases they prosecute, such as dashboard-camera footage from patrol cars, it may be regarded as spoliation of evidence, potentially justifying motions to dismiss and/or mistrials. Police's loss of evidence such as footage may be considered as both spoliation and tampering, if it both exonerates the defendant and proves police misconduct. Spoliation of exonerating evidence in criminal cases may also constitute prosecutorial misconduct if the prosecutor is complicit in doing so.\n\n"}

The tax revenue of Taiwan in 2015 amounted NT$2.1 trillion.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance, which is part of the Executive Yuan, is the highest government entity responsible for implementing taxation policies and overseeing the leveling and collection of taxes. Taxation occurs at both the national and local government level.\n\nTwo broad categories of taxes exist at the national level: customs duties and inland taxes. Customs duties are administered by the Directorate-General of Customs, which has local offices throughout the country. Five national tax administrations who are directly subordinate to the central government handle oversight of all inland taxes. Inland taxes is a broad term that includes:\n\n\nIndividual municipalities, counties, and cities have set up Revenue Service Offices responsible for collecting a range of taxes, including:\n\n\nUnlike the Internal Revenue Code in the United States, there isn't one law that governs taxation in Taiwan. Rather, taxes are governed by a series of laws and regulations each related to a specific type of tax. As the chief legislative body, the Legislative Yuan plays an important role in formulating and revising tax related laws. The Income Tax Act is the primary law that governs individual income and profit-seeking enterprise income taxes.\n\nBoth residents and non-residents are assessed individual income tax on Taiwan-sourced income unless an exception is provided in the Income Tax Act and related laws. Individuals are considered residents of Taiwan for tax purposes if they are either domiciled there, or spend for 183 days or longer in a taxable year.\n\nIncome received in exchange for services rendered while physically present in Taiwan is considered to be Taiwan-sourced income regardless of if the payer is a local or offshore person or entity. One major exception to this rule exists for non-residents who are physically present in Taiwan for less than 91 calendar days in a year and who are only paid compensation by offshore entities.\n\nTaiwan has implemented a progressive tax system for individual income taxes. For the 2017 tax year, the tax rates were as follows:\n\nBy default, the tax year for all individuals and profit-seeking enterprises follows the calendar year. Income tax returns are due by May 31 of the following year, with no extension of time allowed. Taxpayers, including foreigners, are able to complete and file their tax return electronically through software provided by the local taxing authority.\n\nAll profit-seeking businesses in Taiwan are subject to the Profit-Seeking Enterprise Income Tax. Sole proprietors and partners must file a return. However, their portion of the taxable income is reported on their individual income tax return.\n\nIn 2010, the top tax rate was reduced from 25% to 17%, and the threshold below which no tax is owed was raised from NT$50,000 to NT$120,000. Therefore, the current profit-seeking enterprise tax rates are as follows:\n\nThe amount of tax payable shall not exceed half of the amount of the taxable income in excess of NT$120,000.\nIn 2017, tax rate is 5%.\n\nThis tax is paid by sellers of Republic of China securities at a rate of 0.3% of the gross proceeds from the sale of shares issued by companies. A rate of 0.1% applies on the gross proceeds of corporate bonds, however, an exemption has been put in place through 2016. This tax is governed by the regulations set forth in the Securities Transaction Tax Act.\n\nAimed at cooling off real estate speculation that was driving up the cost of living in Taipei City and other urban areas, the Republic of China government implemented a new luxury tax in June 2011. The law imposes a 15% sales tax on owners of second homes who sell within one year of purchase. Additionally, a 10% sales tax is charged against properties sold after being owned for between one and two years. Data provided by the Republic of China government in late 2011 showed that the luxury tax was having the desired effect, causing the average housing price in Taipei to fall nearly 12% while reducing overall volume of real estate transactions island-wide by nearly 15% in the June–October time period.\n\nFirst conceived in the 1950s, the Taiwan government created a uniform invoice system to encourage honest reporting of sales and prevent underpayment of taxes by businesspeople. To provide an incentive, the government launched a receipt lottery system. Each receipt is coded with an alphanumeric number, and every two months a lottery drawing is held with prizes ranging up to NT$10 million (approximately $335,000 USD as of February 2012) depending on how many numbers match. The lottery is governed by the Uniform Invoice Award Regulations.\n\n\n"}

In December 1967 the General Assembly adopted Resolution 2330 (XXII), which established a Special Committee on the Question of Defining Aggression. This body comprised 35 member states. After seven years, it reported back to the General Assembly with draft proposals that formed the basis of the final Definition of Aggression.\n\nThe definition makes a distinction between \"aggression\" (which \"gives rise to international responsibility\") and \"war of aggression\" (which is \"a crime against international peace\"). Article 3 \"in accordance with the provisions of article 2\", defines certain acts as aggression, such as armed invasions or attacks, bombardments, blockades, armed violations of territory, permitting other states to use one's own territory to perpetrate acts of aggression and the employment of armed irregulars or mercenaries to carry out acts of aggression. Article 2 states that the first use of force in contravention of the UN Charter will be prima facie evidence of aggression, but the Security Council has the authority to determine that given the circumstances aggression has not taken place. A war of aggression is a series of acts committed with a sustained intent. The definition's distinction between an \"act\" of aggression and a \"war\" of aggression make it clear that not every act of aggression would constitute a crime against peace; only war of aggression does. States would nonetheless be held responsible for acts of aggression.\n\nThe wording of the definition has been criticised by many commentators. Its clauses on the use of armed irregulars are vague, as it is unclear what level of \"involvement\" would entail state responsibility. It is also highly state-centric, in that it deems states to be the only actors liable for acts of aggression. Domestic or transnational insurgent groups, such as those that took part in the Sierra Leone Civil War and the Yugoslav Wars, were key players in their respective conflicts despite being non-state parties; they would not have come within the scope of the definition.\n\nThe Definition of Aggression also does not cover acts by international organisations. The two key military alliances at the time of the definition's adoption, NATO and the Warsaw Pact, were non-state parties and thus were outside the scope of the definition. Moreover, the definition does not deal with the responsibilities of individuals for acts of aggression. It is widely perceived as an insufficient basis on which to ground individual criminal prosecutions.\n\nThe definition is not binding on the Security Council. The United Nations Charter empowers the General Assembly to make recommendations to the United Nations Security Council but the Assembly may not dictate to the Council. The resolution accompanying the definition states that it is intended to provide guidance to the Security Council to aid it \"in determining, in accordance with the Charter, the existence of an act of aggression\". The Security Council may apply or disregard this guidance as it sees fit. Legal commentators argued in 1999 that the Definition of Aggression has had \"no visible impact\" on the deliberations of the Security Council.\n\n"}

It existed from 1906 to 1943 and had jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters, with appeals taken to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco.\n\nExtraterritorial jurisdiction in China was first granted to the United States by the Treaty of Wanghia upon ratification in 1845, followed by the Treaty of Tientsin ratified in 1860.\n\nUnder the treaties, cases against US citizens were tried in US consular courts, while cases against Chinese nationals were tried in Chinese courts. Consuls had jurisdiction in the following matters:\n\nThe commissioner had jurisdiction to hear all cases, and could prescribe rules of civil and criminal procedure for the consuls to follow.\n\nThe Court was established in 1906 by the Act Creating a United States Court for China.. The Court was similar in structure to the British Supreme Court for China and Corea that had been established in Shanghai in 1865. \n\nThe court was originally headquartered in American Consulate General building on Huangpu Road in the Shanghai International Settlement, with additional sessions held at least annually in the Chinese cities of Canton, Tientsin, and Hankow. The court moved with the US Consulate when the consulate was moved from its previous premises in the years 1911, 1930 and 1936.\n\nThe Court had only one full time judge, and those on trial sometimes had to wait months for proceedings. In the 1930s, the law was amended to allow the appointment of special judges, allowing trials to proceed in the judge's absence. Appeals were allowed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\nThe U.S. consular courts in China retained limited jurisdiction, including civil cases where property involved in the controversy did not exceed $500 and criminal cases where the punishment did not exceed $100 in fines or 60 days' imprisonment. The Court exercised appellate jurisdiction over them, as well as, until 1910 when Japan annexed Korea, US Consular Courts in Korea.\n\nThe court's jurisdiction was given an expansive interpretation:\n\nThe sources of law drawn upon by the Court were quite varied:\n\nThe question as to what constituted \"common law\" led to severe difficulties, because U.S. federal law did not cover many criminal offenses or civil matters (which were normally provided for by U.S. state law). The Ninth Circuit provided a solution to this conundrum in the case of \"Biddle v. United States\", where it was held that the laws of the Territory of Alaska or the District of Columbia were federal law and could be applied by the Court. As a result, Judge Lobingier would later hold that \"there can be no half way adoption of that doctrine; it includes all such laws or none. It cannot logically be restricted to any particular class of acts. It is just as applicable to civil laws as to criminal; just as 'necessary' in respect to corporations as to procedure.\"\n\nThe Court prescribed its own rules for procedures to be followed. This was in contrast to the situation in the States, where civil procedure in actions at law (i.e., most lawsuits for monetary damages) in U.S. federal courts was normally provided for by state law, by virtue of the Conformity Act of 1872, until the promulgation of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in 1938.\n\nThe United States Congress also passed several statutes conferring specific powers on the Court:\n\nThe act establishing the court provided: \"The seal of the United States Court for China shall be the arms of the United States, engraved on a circular piece of steel of the size of a half dollar, with these words in the margin 'The Seal of the United States Court for China'\". The seal was to be used to seal all writs, processes and other documents issued by the court.\n\nPersons who were convicted of criminal offences for relatively short sentences for either imprisoned in the Consular Gaol in the consulate or Ward Road Gaol (and sometimes Amoy Road Gaol) run by the Shanghai Municipal Council. Those serving longer sentences were sent to Bilibid Prison in the Philippines and later from the 1920s were generally sent to the federal penitentiary at McNeil Island in Washington State to serve their sentence.\n\n The United States Consulate and Court in Shanghai were occupied by the Japanese on 8 December 1941 at the beginning of the Pacific War. The Judge and other staff were interned for 6 months before being repatriated. \n\nAmericans continued to enjoy extraterritorial rights in those parts of China not occupied by the Japanese. On 11 January 1943, the U.S. and China signed the Treaty for Relinquishment of Extraterritorial Rights in China, thereby relinquishing all U.S. extraterritorial rights. The treaty was ratified by the United States Senate and came into force on 20 May 1943. As a result, both the U.S. Court for China and the U.S. Consular Courts in China were abolished. However, their judgments continued to serve as res judicata within China.\n\nThe very last case before the court was heard in Kunming starting on 14 January 1943. Boatner Carney of the Flying Tigers was prosecuted for manslaughter before Special Judge Bertrand E Johnson. Carney was convicted of unlawful killing and sentenced to two years imprisonment. He was pardoned 6 months later by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nTwo individuals were also appointed Special Judges of the Court to try cases when the Judge was not available. They were:\n\n\n\nThe following attorneys of note were admitted to practice before the court:\n\n\n\n\n"}
