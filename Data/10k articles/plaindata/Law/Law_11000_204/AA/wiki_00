The context for these negotiations or conflicts can range from mergers & acquisitions and international trade deals, to hostage-takings and initiating change at a local school board. \n\nA larger party in one context can be a smaller party in another. For instance, a US corporation may be a much larger buyer in an asymmetric negotiation with a North American supplier, while reduced to being a relatively small player overseas in negotiations with the European Union where it has fewer resources and less clout. \n\nJust as in asymmetric warfare, research has shown that smaller players can prevail in getting what they want from much larger players by applying distinct approaches, strategies and tactics that increase their odds of success.\n\nThis specific form of negotiation contrasts with symmetrical or standard negotiations where the parties are more similar in size.\n\nGiven the growing number of large corporations and government entities worldwide, and the corresponding growth in asymmetric negotiations, this phenomenon has received increasing attention in recent decades, with numerous journalists and academics addressing the subject in articles and journals. International negotiator Peter D. Johnston’s book \"Negotiating with Giants\" provides an in-depth survey of “size-imbalanced” negotiations. In this 2008 book, Johnston studied more than 100 negotiations from across history to the present day, where smaller players got what they wanted from much larger players, with the author identifying unique strategies that worked for these “Davids” in their negotiations with wide-ranging giants or “Goliaths.” \n\nAccording to Johnston, successful smaller players should change the game on their larger counterparts by using seven distinct approaches given the unique challenges they face in asymmetric negotiations:\n\n\n"}

In another account, Ubay ibn Ka'b informed Zayd that the Prophet taught him the end of this \"sūrah\" and recited the same verses. Some, like Ibn Hazm, suggested that Abu Khuzayma was the only one to have the last verses in written form, as Zayd and others had memorized them.\n\nAt-Tawba also features Verse 29, a verse that appears to promote jihad against \"people of the Scripture\" and as such is a subject of much debate.\nIn Kitab al-Kafi, Ja'far al-Sadiq has narrated that Imams are not needy to what people own but rather collect religious tax on accord that Allah said 9:103 Take from their wealth (religious tax) and charity by which you purify them and cause them increase and invoke blessings upon them.

It is located on the Avenida Libertador General Bernardo O'Higgins in Santiago, in a building completed in 1925, though its history reaches to the early nineteenth century before it was relocated to its current home.\n\nThe Biblioteca Nacional is, together with the Instituto Nacional and a small number of institutions, one of the first institutions created by the newly formed Republic of Chile in the Patria Vieja period. In the newspaper \"El Monitor Araucano\", a \"Proclama de Fundación\" (\"Proclamation of Foundation\") of the Biblioteca Nacional was published on August 19, 1813. With this vision, a call was made to all the citizens to submit their books for the formation of one great public library. As with other republican institutions, the library was closed after the Disaster of Rancagua, in which the national troops were defeated by the army of the \"realistas\". With the victorious Battle of Chacabuco, it was reopened and supported by the government, and started to receive important collections. The Supreme Director of Chile, Bernardo O'Higgins, named professor Manuel de Salas as the first director of the Biblioteca Nacional. In 1822 Friar Camilo Henríquez (director of the \"Aurora de Chile\") newspaper was named as the second head librarian.\nSince its creation, the library had been a dependency of the Universidad de San Felipe and its successor, the Universidad de Chile, until it gained autonomy in 1852. In 1913, upon its 100th anniversary, the Biblioteca Nacional acquired the \"Monasterio de Santa Clara\", located on the Alameda de las Delicias on present-day Cerro Santa Lucía. At the creation in 1929, the library was made into a dependency of the \"Dirección de Bibliotecas, Archivos y Museos\".\n\nSince 1925, Biblioteca Nacional has been situated in the centre of Santiago, Chile. It was formerly located in the square where now stands the \"Teatro Municipal de Santiago\" (Municipal Theater of Santiago).\n\nConstruction of the present building began in 1913. It was commissioned as one of the commemorative public works in honour of the first centenary of the independence of Chile. The building boasts an imposing façade of columns and arches, of very pronounced French neoclassical influence. The library shares its building with the Archivo Nacional de Chile (the National Archive). Adjoining the building is the Santa Lucía metro station, and to the east is Cerro Santa Lucía.\n\nThe interior, spread out over two main levels and a basement, has been embellished and decorated with carved marble staircases, sculptures and paintings from some of the country’s classic artists, such as Alfredo Helsby and Arturo Gordon.\n\nThe Biblioteca Nacional has an extensive and valuable collection of books and manuscripts. Several of these were acquired from or donated by their owners, making up an important national historical treasure. The most important collections include:\n\n"}

The enactment of the Libyan Constitution was significant in that it was the first and only piece of legislation that formally entrenched the rights of Libyan citizens after the post-war creation of the Libyan nation state.\n\nThe Libyan National Assembly drafted the Constitution and passed a resolution accepting it in a meeting held in the city of Benghazi on Sunday, 6th Muharram, Hegiras 1371: October 7, 1951. Mohamed Abulas’ad El-Alem, President of the National Assembly and the two Vice-Presidents of the National Assembly, Omar Faiek Shennib and Abu Baker Ahmed Abu Baker executed and submitted the Constitution to King Idris prior to its publication in the Official Gazette of Libya.\n\nThe enactment of the Libyan Constitution was significant in that it was the first piece of legislation to formally entrench the rights of Libyan citizens following the post-war creation of the Libyan nation state. Following on from the intense UN debates, during which Idris had argued that the creation of a single Libyan state would be of benefit to the regions of Tripolitania, Fezzan, and Cyrenaica, the Libyan government was keen to formulate a constitution which contained many of the entrenched rights common to European and North American nation states.\n\nFollowing the \"Green Revolution\" military coup of 1969, led by Colonel Gaddafi, that overthrew the monarchy and the Libyan National Assembly, the Libyan Constitution was no longer in effect. \"The Green Book\" put forth by Gaddafi became the foundation of the laws of Libya.\n\nThe Constitution of the Kingdom of Libya included a Preamble and twelve Chapters outlining the protection of human rights in Libya and regulating the nature and functions of the institutional apparatus of the Libyan State. Law N. 1 of 1963 abolished Chapter 3 and Articles 173, 174, and 175, thereby suppressing the Federal Regime originally established by the 1951 Constitution.\n\nChapter 1 of the 1951 Constitution defined the “Form of State and System of Government of the Country”, while Chapter 2 described the “Rights of People”. Chapter 3, repealed in 1963, included a first section regarding the “Powers of the Federal Government” and a second section pertaining to “Joint Powers.”\n\nChapter 4 organized the Libyan State’s “General Powers” arrangement, further articulated in Chapters 5 through 8 (“The King”; “The Ministers”; “Parliament”, including three sections regulating “The Senate”, “The House of Representatives”, and “Provisions Common to the Two Chambers”; “The Judiciary”).\n\nFinally, Chapter 9 through 12 discussed Libya’s “Fiscal System” (as amended in 1963), the “Local Administration”, as well as “General Provisions” and “Transitory and Provisional Provisions.”\n\nThe Preamble to the Libyan Constitution sets out the terms under which the union of the regions of Cyrenaica, Tripolitania and Fezzan into Libyan came about:\n\n\"In the name of God the beneficent, the merciful.\n\"We, the representatives of the people of Libya from Cyrenaica, Tripolitania and Fezzan, meeting by the will of God in the cities of Tripoli and Benghazi in a National Constituent Assembly. Having agreed and determined to form a union (1) between us under the Crown of King Mohammad Idris el Senussi, to whom the nation has offered the Crown and who was declared constitutional King of Libya by this the National Constituent Assembly. And having decided and determined to establish a democratic independent sovereign State which will guarantee the national unity, safeguard domestic tranquillity, provide the means for common defence, secure the establishment of justice, guarantee the principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity and promote economic and social progress and the general welfare. And trusting in God, Master of the Universe, do hereby prepare and resolve this Constitution for the Kingdom of Libya (2).\n\n(1) Federal Regime repealed by Law No. 1 of 1963.\n(2) Name of the State amended to read \"The Kingdom of Libya\" by Law No. 1 of 1963.\"\"\n\nThe full text of Chapters I and II of the Constitution of Libya is below\n\nConstitution of Libya\n\nChapter I-The Form of the State and the System of Government\n\nChapter II-Rights of the People\n\nThe Libyan National Assembly prepared and resolved this Constitution in its meeting held in the city of Benghazi on Sunday, 6th Muharram, Hegera 1371 corresponding to 7 October 1951, and delegated its president and the two Vice-Presidents to promulgate it and submit it to His Majesty, the Exalted King, and published in the Official Gazette in Libya.\nIn pursuance of the Resolution of the National Assembly we have promulgated this Constitution in the city of Benghazi on Sunday, the 6th day of Muharram, Hegera 1371, corresponding to the 7th day of October 1951.\n\nMohamed Abulas'as El-Alem\n\nOmar Faiek Shennib\n\nAbubaker Ahmed Abubaker\n\nThe Libyan Constitution contained many elements traditional to the regional, such as proclaiming Islam the religion of the State and setting out in detail the terms on which the hereditary monarchy should govern together with the procedure for succession. In particular, Articles 44 and 45 of the 1951 Constitution specify that Throne of the Kingdom of Libya is transmitted through male preference primogeniture, in line with the Libyan tradition codified by two Royal Orders promulgated on 22nd of Safar 1374 H. and the 25th of Rabi’e el-Thani 1376 H.\n\nHowever, the charter also contain several provisions which entrenched the rights of its citizens to enjoy certain rights common to European and North American nation states, indicating the influence of the key western players in the region. Thus, while stopping short of a secular state (Article 5 proclaims Islam the religion) and while envisioning an inviolable Monarch (Article 59 exempts the King from all responsibility), the 1951 Constitution established a robust democratic apparatus and instituted solid mechanisms for the protection of human rights.\n\nIn particular, Chapter II (Rights of the People) of the Constitution of Libya set out rights such as equality before the law as well as equal civil and political rights, equal opportunities, and an equal responsibility for public duties and obligations, \"without distinction of religion, belief, race, language, wealth, kinship or political or social opinions\" (Article 11).\n\nMany provisions appear to be in line with modern international standards for the protection of human rights, especially those pertaining to the right to recourse before the courts. Moreover, several profiles of the institutional apparatus established by the Constitution of Libya – particularly articles regulating the autonomy of the members of the Parliament in their legislative function (Art. 108), the independence of the judiciary (Art. 142), and procedures for overturning a veto by the King (Art. 136) – present elements of democracy.\n\nSimilarly, the accountability of ministers and public officers is guaranteed by Artt. 90, 114, and 122. Art. 197 enshrines the representative form of the Libyan government and prohibits future amendments that could alter that nature.\n\nThe document sets out a representative parliamentary system based on universal adult suffrage and a Constitutional monarchy in which the King promulgates but cannot veto the Parliament’s acts. Nonetheless, the system of checks and balances among the branches of the Libyan government that the charter enshrines appears to relatively week, especially in light of the limited independence of the judiciary. Moreover, no detailed provision pertaining to democratic elections is available in the document.\n\nFollowing the coup led by the Libyan army on 1 September 1969 and Idris's subsequent abdication, the Libyan Constitution ceased to have any direct applicability. Several actors, however, have asserted the enduring relevance of the 1951 Constitution.\n\nThe document was received as a forward-thinking model of good governance for the region at the time it was released. Significantly, a paper produced in 2012 by Berlin-based independent NGO Democracy Reporting International emphasized that especially the constitutional provisions regarding the protection of human rights, transparency, and safeguards against antidemocratic power accumulations continue to make the charter an attractive document and an important reference point towards a solution to Libya’s political crisis.\n\nGrowing support on the ground in Libya for the idea that a return to the 1951 Constitution could best serve a transition to a unified and politically stable country was recorded since 2011. Grassroots campaigns promoted by groups devoted to the “Return of the Constitutional Legitimacy” developed in major cities across Libya – from Tripoli, to Zliten, to Benghazi, to Misrata – and gathered significant traction and following on social media.\n\nSimilar support to the restoration of the Constitution of Libya was voiced by several members of the Libyan committee responsible for drafting a new constitution, the so-called Constitution Drafting Assembly, in 2015 through an online petition. Then-Bayda Mayor Ali Hussain Bubaker wrote a letter to formally endorse the cause as well. Also in 2015 Cyrenaican party supporting federalist solutions, the National Federal Bloc, petitioned the Parliament to adopt the Constitution of Libya as a valid and legitimate charter for the entire country.\n\nGrowing support for the call for the reinstatement of the Constitution of Libya was also recorded by the international press, especially The National Interest in July 2014 and New York Times in February 2016. In June 2015, British Member of the Parliament Daniel Kawczynski publicly advocated for the return of the Constitution of Libya in response to the increasing support to the cause.\n\nIn parallel, the vast majority of the local supportive actors have called for the reinstatement of the Senussi monarchy under the leadership of Mohammed El Hassan El Rida El Senussi as part of the same political project.\n\nWhen Gaddafi seized power in 1969, Crown Prince Hasan as-Senussi was acting as Regent on behalf of King Idris. He was arrested along with his family and many members of the extended royal household, isolated for years and publicly humiliated by the Gaddafi regime. When, in 1984, he was released from house arrest, he travelled to the UK to seek medical treatment after a stroke had seriously compromised his health. Before dying, in 1992, he designated his second son, Prince Mohammed, as the legitimate heir to the Senussi Crown of Libya.\n\nNotably, in April 2014 leading pan-Arab newspaper Al-Hayat published an interview with Mohamed Abdelaziz, who was then serving as Libya’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, claiming that the reinstatement of the Constitutional Monarchy as regulated by the 1951 Constitution would serve as a “uniting symbol for the nation” as well as “a political umbrella” towards the institution of a regime with a two-council parliament and a technocratic government directed by a prime minister.\n\nOn October 31, 2017, nearly a thousand supporters gathered for the National Conference for the Activation of the Constitution of Independence in Gharyan, one of the largest towns in the Western Mountains. Supporters feel the return to the pre-Gaddafi political governance – a time of stability and unity in Libya – will help pull the country out of its enduring crisis.\n\nPrince Mohammed El Senussi, the legitimate heir to the Libyan monarchy, was widely referenced during the event as the would-be leader of the Libyan people if the Constitution of 1951 is restored. Supporters called for Senussi to “assume all his constitutional powers and resume the constitutional life that the founding fathers created.”\n\nThe conference was broadcast live on Libyan television, and attendees traveled from many various parts of the region, including Tripoli, Zliten, Benghazi, and Misrata, where grassroots movements advocating for “Return of the Constitutional Legitimacy” have gained momentum.\n\nAshraf Baoudoura, who coordinated the event, said similar conferences will be held in Beida, Jaghbub and Tobruk.\n\n"}

Convicts are often also known as \"prisoners\" or \"inmates\" or by the slang term \"con\", while a common label for former convicts, especially those recently released from prison, is \"ex-con\" (\"ex-convict\"). Persons convicted and sentenced to non-custodial sentences tend not to be described as \"convicts\".\n\nThe legal label of \"ex-convict\" usually has lifelong implications, such as social stigma and/or reduced opportunities for employment. The federal government of Australia, for instance, will not, in general, employ an ex-convict, while some state and territory governments may limit the time for or before which a former convict may be employed.\n\nThe particular use of the term \"convict\" in the English-speaking world was to describe the huge numbers of criminals, both male and female, who clogged British gaols in the 18th and early 19th century. Their crimes would today be regarded as petty misdemeanours (stealing small items or food), or are no longer in the criminal code (such as being in unresolved debt). Most of the punishments at this time were severe, with the death penalty (hanging) applied for fairly minor crimes. However, this ultimate sentence was often commuted to a lesser one, commonly for transportation (for 7 or 14 years, or for life) to the colonies. Thus, in the British context, the term \"convict\" has come to refer in particular to those criminals transported overseas.\n\nInitially many British convicts were sent to the American colonies, such as the Maryland, Virginia, and the Georgia, as cheap labour. The transportation of convicts from the United Kingdom began around 1615 and became increasingly common in the following years. Initially most people were transported to North America or the West Indies, but from 1718 onwards transportation was entirely to North America. The arrangements ceased when the American Revolutionary War meant it was no longer possible for the United Kingdom to send convicts to what had become the United States.\n\nThe British Government then looked to the newly discovered east coast of Australia to use as a penal colony. Convicts were transported to Australia in 1787, arriving in Botany Bay, then Sydney Cove, in January 1788. From the very start of European settlement convicts were used as indentured labourers in five out of the six colonies. Many were used on public works, but a significant number were \"assigned\" to private individuals as domestic servants, rural workers, etc. Transportation was progressively abolished from 1853, eventually ceasing altogether in 1868.\n\nIn Australia, convicts have come to be key figures of cultural mythology and historiography. Many became prominent businesspeople and respected citizens, and some prominent families in present-day Australian society can trace their origins to convict ancestors who rose above their humble origins. However, during the transportation era and for many years after, previous convicts and their descendants tended to hide their former criminal background, sometimes resulting in distorted or completely missing family history. Extensive and comprehensive records kept on every individual are now able to fill in the gaps; and, in fact, many family historians can find out more about their convict ancestors than they can about those who arrived in Australia as free settlers.\n\nBritish convicts were also sent to Canada, West Africa, and India. France also sent convicts to New Caledonia and to Devil's Island in French Guiana.\n\n\n"}

In Chile quotations is limited to literary works, and is limited to ten lines of text.\n\n\nAllows the public communication of works in educational, charitable or similar settings, or at home, if this communication is non-profit.\n\nThese works can be published for information purposes only.\n\nPlayable lessons such as teaching notes, sounds or videos, but its publication requires permission from the copyright holder of the lessons.\n\nIn May 2007, President Michelle Bachelet sent Congress a proposed amendment to this law, pretending to make procedures more effective prosecution of crimes, increase penalties for violations of fronts to establish a system of limiting liability for Internet service providers, incorporate exceptions and limitations that are favorable to libraries, educational establishments and the general public, and regulate the establishment of tariffs by the collecting societies.\n\nThe project was very controversial due to the opposition of interests, including the Sociedad Chilena del Derecho de Autor (SCD), the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, the Chilean Book Chamber on the one hand, and on the other hand are the academic institutions, College of Librarians of Chile, Library Council of Rectors of Universities, NGO Digital Rights, among many others.\n\nThe Ministry of Culture, in turn, led the process in Congress, in which signed a controversial confidentiality agreement with the collecting society who agreed to accept a series of demands of copyright holders including the elimination of a number of exceptions for educational use, libraries and primarily uses the exception of the proposal fair. One of the most controversial provisions has been the establishment of an exemption permitting certain uses of protected works without permission, equivalent to the American fair use.\n\nAfter all the discussion, on 13 January 2010, this flagship project of the administration of Paulina Urrutia was approved unanimously by the National Congress of Chile, entered into force on 4 May 2010, as No. 20.435.\n\n"}

Consequently the current collections have been built since 1829 only.\nFrom 1876 to 1914, Paul Viollet, head librarian, dedicated much effort to developing the library’s collections. At that time, the library was located in the main building of the Law School of Paris, on the Place du Panthéon. In 1958, a new building was opened to house the Library.\nIn 1970, the University of Paris was split into several universities. The former Law School library became an inter-university library. In 1978, the library took the name of Cujas Library.\nSince 1979, Cujas Library has been operating under the supervision of Panthéon-Assas University and Pantheon-Sorbonne University.\n\nAccess to the library is mainly for scholars, Panthéon-Assas University and Panthéon-Sorbonne University 3rd-year undergraduates and postgraduates, and other universities' students (LLM and PhD students), and people with special interests in law, economics, and political sciences.\n\nThe library is specialized in Law, since it has been and still is a major reference and research library in legal studies.

{"id": "30971124", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30971124", "title": "Customary law in South Africa", "text": "Customary law in South Africa\n\nSouth African customary law refers to a usually uncodified legal system developed and practised by the indigenous communities of South Africa. Customary law has been defined as\n\nan established system of immemorial rules [...] evolved from the way of life and natural wants of the people, the general context of which was a matter of common knowledge, coupled with precedents applying to special cases, which were retained in the memories of the chief and his councilors, their sons and their sons' sons until forgotten, or until they became part of the immemorial rules.\nMost African states follow a pluralistic form of law that includes customary law, religious laws, received law (such as common law or civil law) and state legislation. The South African Constitution recognizes traditional authority and customary law under Section 211. A ruling under \"Bhe v. Magistrate, Khayelitsha\" specified that customary law was \"protected by and subject to the Constitution in its own right.\" Customary law, prior to colonialism, had its \"sources in the practices, traditions and customs of the people.\" Customary law is fluid, and changes over time and among different groups of people. In addition, ethnicity is often tied into customary law. Sally Falk Moore suggests that to have a more realistic idea of the manner in which people live according to 'the law' and 'social mores' it is necessary to study the law in the context of society, rather than attempting to separate the 'law' from 'society'.\n\nRecognition of customary law comes through the South African Constitution under section 211, although there is not a \"textual connection in the definition of customary law to the communities recognised in section 31(1).\" The application of African Customary Law (ACL) is subject to the Constitution as well as to any legislation that specifically deals with it.\n\nAfrican Customary Law (ACL) is further protected within the Bill of Rights, most notably under the right to freedom, belief and opinion (s 15), the individual right to language and culture (s 30) as well as the collective right pertaining to cultural, religious and linguistic communities (s 31). The protection of ACL within the Bill of Rights is not subject to the same conditions as in s 211(3), namely that it must be used where applicable and subject to the relevant legislation. Accordingly, the rights in the Bill of Rights protecting ACL are subject only to the Constitution (and specifically, other rights in the Bill of Rights), and can only be limited in terms of s 36, being the general limitations clause.\n\nPursuant to the Constitutional Principles, the Constitution protects and recognises ACL in various ways. Chapter 12 (ss 211 and 212) affords official recognition to ACL as well as to the institution, status and role of traditional leadership. Specifically, s 211(3) mandates the application of ACL by the courts, where applicable.\n\nDevelopments in customary law took place primarily after 1652, when colonial settlers arrived in South Africa. It didn't take long for the coloniser to realise that colonial law was not always appropriate or convenient for the colonised in dealing with instances of everyday life (such as family law). Accordingly, the colonial state began to define the parameters that marked the jurisdictions of legal systems within its control and, in so doing, divided colonial and customary law into \"separate and [allegedly] autonomous spheres.\" In addition, there were many different types of customary law, each based on the indigenous group practicing the law.\n\nMahmood Mamdani has emphasized the importance of Theophilus Shepstone's role in creating the system known today as indirect rule and, with it, official customary law. Shepstone, as the highest colonial official in Natal, was responsible for all native affairs from the creation of the colony until his transfer to the Transvaal in 1877. He combined both \"indigenous customs and British legal procedures\" into what was called \"native customary law.\" Combining these two types of law into one allowed the colonizers to \"use\" traditional leaders and traditional ceremonies to support their own legal legitimacy in South Africa. The \"Shepstone system\" enforced a \"patriarchal arrangement\" of hierarchy and became the foundation of policy for dealing with indigenous peoples in South Africa for many decades afterwards.\n\nIn 1847, the Natal Commission found that any \"African law which was not incompatible with Roman-Dutch law would have to be used for the time being.\" In Natal, customary law was further recognized through the Natal Code of 1878. The code defined \"native law\" and \"included the subjugation of women to men, the subjugation of children their father or to the head of the family, and the rule of primogeniture.\" The Northern Republics of South Africa (Transvaal and the Free State) were less inclined to allow or accommodate a system of African customary law that was separate to the Republican law.\n\nThe British defeat by the Zulu in 1879 and the Zulu rebellion of 1906 had profound effects on South African law and customary law in Natal. Likewise, the Cape Colony met customary law with a policy of assimilation. The assimilation was started by the abolition of slavery and lip service was given to the notion of 'rights to all', regardless of race. In 1880, the government looked into native laws and customs in order to codify criminal and civil law. Natives were never used as a source of information for their own culture. However, many objections stifled assimilation, including the colonial objection to customary practices pertaining to inheritance and marriage, especially in regard to polygamy and bride prices.\n\nAfter the Union of South Africa was created in 1910, customary law was handled by each separate territory as needed. Because of the confusion created by this system, the government created the Native Administration Act of 1927. This law, in Section 11, recognized customary law, so that it would be \"granted full recognition in both chiefly and Commissioner courts,\" with the commissioner deciding where and when customary law may be applied.\n\nAfter the National Party gained power, they introduced apartheid in 1948 and used the Bantu Authorities Act of 1951 to create \"an administrative hierarchy of tribal, regional, and territorial authorities in traditional communities.\"\n\nSouth Africa's transition to a constitutional democracy came about through an intricate negotiation process between the various political parties. In essence, it was a two-step process. It involved, in the first instance, the drafting of an Interim Constitution in 1993 and its subsequent approval by the parties in the Multi-Party Negotiating Process (MPNP). Constituencies of traditional leaders were represented at the MPNP. The issues that concerned these leaders, mainly relating to the status of African Customary Law (ACL) and the recognition of a right to culture in the Constitution, became some of the most hotly contested issues during the negotiations.\n\nThe effect of a supreme constitution would allow for judicial review of the actions of traditional leaders as well as scrutiny and amendment of ACL more generally. The debate centred on the issue of gender equality because some of the tenets of ACL accord more rights and authority to men than they do women. At times, the bargaining process was used as a means to secure the role of the traditional leaders in the new constitutional era. One difficulty is that ACL was subverted by colonialism and apartheid rule.\n\nInitially, the traditional leaders tried to get an exemption for ACL from the application of the Bill of Rights. They based their arguments on the Zimbabwean Constitution. The interim Constitution came into effect on 27 April 1994, coinciding with South Africa's first democratic elections. After an intensive Constitutional Assembly negotiation process, and a process of its certification by the Constitutional Court against the Constitutional Principles in the Interim Constitution, the final Constitution was passed in 1996 and came into force in early 1997.\n\nThere have been a number of cases that have come before the Constitutional Court requiring it to interpret and apply the rights and principles in the Constitution pertaining to ACL. In doing so, the CC has not only been faced with the challenge of elucidating the extent to which ACL is now recognised, but it has also had to address the issue of how to go about ascertaining what that law in fact is. The first such substantive case is \"Alexkor Ltd and Another v the Richtersveld Community and Others\", which involved the appeal of a claim for restitution of land by the Richtersveld Community ('the Community'), an indigenous South African community, in terms of the Restitution of Land Rights Act. The Constitutional Court therefore had to examine whether or not the Community had rights in land in 1913 and, if so, whether or not it was subsequently dispossessed 'as a result of past racially discriminatory laws or practices.' It was in answering the first of these questions that the Court made various authoritative comments regarding the extent to which ACL is now recognised.\n\nThe Court essentially stated two broad principles. Firstly, ACL is an independent source of law, not to be interpreted 'through the common-law lens.' Instead, it is to be seen as parallel to the common law. Secondly, the recognition of ACL is circumscribed by its consistency with the Constitution and any legislation concerning ACL. The CC drew specifically on s 211(3) of the Constitution. Applying these principles, the Court found that the Community did indeed have (indigenous) rights in land in 1913, which were left unaltered by British annexation. It then added an important third principle – that customary law in the Constitution really referred to the living form of that law:\n\nThe court specifically acknowledged the difficulty of establishing customary law, given the relative unreliability of written sources on customary law, and the fact that there may be competing versions of customary law presented in evidence, when such is appealed to.\n\nIn a subsequent case of \"Shilubana and Others v Nwamitwa\", the Constitutional Court spelled out the principles that should govern how living customary law rules are identified by courts and when courts should develop the customary law. Ms Shilubana, of the Valoyi traditional community, which is located in the Limpopo Province of South Africa, was appointed as hosi (chief) of her people contrary to the past practice of the eldest son of the previous hosi succeeding his father as the new hosi. The resolution adopted in appointing her specifically referred to the constitutional provision for gender equality as part of the community's motivation in adapting its rules. Mr Nwamitwa sought to dispute Ms Shilubana's appointment based on his purported right as the eldest son of the previous hosi. The matter was decided in favour of Mr Nwamitwa in both the High Court and the SCA, and the case was eventually taken on appeal to the Constitutional Court. In a unanimous judgment, the Court decided that Ms Shilubana was legitimately appointed as hosi of the Valoyi people. The Court emphasised the fact that ACL is a living system of law not bound by historical precedent. Because of this, it set aside a series of prior decisions that had set a test for determining the content of customary law by referencing long-standing and historical practices. The Court found that ACL is meant to reflect the current practices of a particular community and hence is developed with reference to the constantly evolving practices that indicate the current system of norms by which that community has chosen to live. The Court therefore held that the ACL regarding the hosi had legitimately developed to allow for a woman to be appointed and that this development was consistent with the Constitution. Therefore, the appeal was upheld, the Court finding that Ms Shilubana had been validly appointed.\n\nThe precedent of \"Shilubana\" stopped courts from avoiding the difficulties by devising a test that finally forced them to confront these challenges directly.Woodman refers to the second option as \"selective legal pluralism\" and affords the state with the opportunity to consider the needs of justice in each case involving customary law. Consequently, Woodman argues that to achieve justice, elements of state law pluralism should coincide with deep legal pluralism with the operation of is doctrine of selective legal pluralism. It would seem that, in this decision, the Constitutional Court espoused Woodman's theory of \"selective legal pluralism\". Woodman refers to two options available at this point; either an unqualified tolerance can be afforded to customary law, or allowance can be made for the purposeful and principled intrusion by the state into the field of customary law.\n\nCustomary law in South Africa is tied to ethnicity, so that \"a Zulu who desires expressly or by implication to be bound by Sotho customary law could be faced with considerable difficulties despite the promise of section 30 of the Constitution.\" Customary law and ethnicity has roots in the idea of kinship, which colonizers used to enforce morality within tribes and between tribes.\n\nThe recognition of ACL has tended to be seen as a danger to women's rights and interests. The system of customary law, running parallel to state legislation \"create a stumbling block for advancing gender equality and women's rights.\" Women have been denied many rights under customary law and were even seen as legal minors, regardless of their age. Women seeking redress in a traditional court may, according to customary law, be unable to represent herself. As a result, most strategies to secure women's rights (in land) in rural South Africa have tended to avoid the customary law arena and instead favoured formal legal initiatives.\n\nAninka Claassens and Sindiso Mnisi advocate that legal strategies to support women's rights cannot avoid the customary law arena and should, in fact, engage with it fully. This is because of the impact of ACL on power relations, which means that rural women have no option but to grapple with issues of rights and custom at the local level. Legal strategies therefore need to pay attention to the legal changes taking place outside the statutory law arena, where women are playing a key role in negotiating the content of rights under custom, and appealing to both the discourses of rights and custom as they do so. The National Movement of Rural Women (NMRW) was created to help rural women keep control of their land and to give them a greater voice in government.\n\nThe customary laws of marriage and succession are the main areas where the South African legislature and courts have attempted to advance women's rights. With regard to marriage, in 1998, Parliament passed the Recognition of Customary Marriages Act with the intention of ridding the customary law of marriage of elements that discriminated against women. The Act makes provision for customary marriages in two ways: firstly, all marriages prior to the Act that were valid in terms of ACL are valid for all legal purposes (this did away with the ambivalence in South African history toward the legitimacy of African marriages); and secondly, all marriages conducted in terms of ACL after the Act came into force are valid if they fulfil the Act's requirements. Both customary marriages and civil marriages could be registered at Home Affairs. The Act accommodates what might be called common law provisions in areas of minors' marriages, the status of spouses, as well as the proprietary consequences of marriage and divorce.\n\nOfficially, in terms of the Recognition of Customary Marriages Act, \"'customary law' means the customs and usages traditionally observed among the indigenous African peoples of South Africa and form part of the culture of those peoples.\" There is no clear distinction, then, between the religion, the culture and the law of such peoples. In terms of the eventually rejected Traditional Courts Bill introduced in 2008, power would have been consolidated with traditional leaders.\n\n\n"}

As Pakistan signed the International Covenant for Civil and Political rights (ICCR), it is required to issue its citizens such right. The right to access information was further specified in the 2010 constitutional amendment, which declared that under Article 19-A “Every citizen shall have the right to have access to information in all matters of public importance subject to regulation and reasonable restrictions imposed by law.” Both federal and provincial governments issued various laws in order to allow Pakistani citizens to exercise their right to access public data.\n\nPakistan was the first South Asian country to enact a law on freedom of information, when it passed the Freedom of Information (FOI) Ordinance at the Federal level in 1997. This Ordinance was later revoked and a new Freedom of Information Ordinance was issued in 2002, which has a legal status to this day as it was covered under the 17th Amendment to the Constitution. In 2004, the Freedom of Information Rules 2004 were enforced by the Federal Government, which described the procedural aspect of the Freedom of Information Ordinance. In 2016, a draft of a new federal Right to Information (RTI) bill was proposed by Pakistan’s federal government in hopes of replacing the Freedom of Information Ordinance of 2002, but the approval of the bill is still pending.\n\nThe FOI Ordinance authorizes Pakistani citizens to gain access to data held by the national government. The Ordinance only pertains to the Federal Government organizations and does not apply to any provincial governments or private entities funded by the national government. The Freedom of Information Rules 2004 details the procedure through which the governmental data can be requested: applicants must pay a fee and enclose the purpose of their inquiry by providing specific reasons as to why they need the information. If the requested information is not provided in 21 days, the applicant may file a complaint to the head of the public body. Only access to public records is permitted, which excludes such documents as notes, timings of meetings, personal bank account data, classified information, data pertaining to national security, etc. The draft of the federal RTI bill is not significantly different from the FOI Ordinance of 2004, however, it has a change in scope as the new bill is not restricted to only governmental organizations, but it also applies to non-governmental bodies that are funded or registered by the national government.\n\nThe FOI Ordinance of 2004 laid the basis for the following two provincial laws: The Baluchistan Freedom of Information Act in 2005 and Sindh Freedom of Information Act in 2006. In addition, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Right to Information Act (KPK RTI) and the Punjab Transparency and Right to Information Ordinance were both passed in 2013.

Connecticut's government has operated under the direction of five separate documents in its history. The Connecticut Colony at Hartford was governed by the Fundamental Orders, and the Quinnipiac Colony at New Haven had its own Constitution in \"The Fundamental Agreement of the New Haven Colony\" which was signed on 4 June 1639.\n\nIn 1662, Connecticut was granted governmental authority and a royal charter by King Charles II of England. These two documents laid the groundwork for the state's government, but lacked characteristics of what is generally thought of as a constitution. Separate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A true constitution was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. The current state constitution was implemented in 1965; it absorbed the majority of its 1818 predecessor and incorporated a handful of important modifications.\n\nThe Fundamental Orders of Connecticut were adopted on January 14, 1639, and the document has often been referred to as the world's first written constitution. At the urging of influential preacher Thomas Hooker, the Connecticut legislative body (or General Court) began secret committee meetings to discuss drafting the orders in June 1638. The Council completed its efforts by the beginning of 1639, and the Fundamental Orders became the cornerstone of government in Connecticut soon after.\n\nConnecticut was founded by Congregationalists who split away from the Massachusetts colony between 1635 and 1636. The first settlers founded three towns on the Connecticut River in Windsor, Wethersfield, and Hartford, Connecticut. One of the main purposes of the Fundamental Orders was to formalize the relationship among these three towns. The foundation of the Fundamental Orders incorporated the religious background of the colony's founders. They called for \"an orderly and decent government according to God\" in attempts to pursue \"the liberty and purity of the gospel of our Lord Jesus\" and stipulated that \"the Governor be always a member of some approved congregation\".\n\nNew Haven Colony was separate at the time, and their Fundamental Agreement (1639) states that \"church members only shall be free burgesses\". Voting rights were further limited under the Fundamental Orders. All males at least 21 years of age could become freemen (voters) if they met certain property qualifications. In order to vote, the citizen must own real estate assessed at a yearly rental value of 40 shillings or own taxable property assessed at 40 pounds sterling.\n\nThe governance of Connecticut developed over the roughly 180 years from the ideas presented by Rev. Thomas Hooker in 1638, to the Constitution of 1818. Connecticut's government had separation of powers as defined by the original \"Fundamental Orders\" of 1639, but with a strong single assembly. However, instead of having a Royally appointed governor, it elected its own and appointed its own judges. It changed over the next 50 years into a bicameral legislature with a strong governor and a more independent judiciary.\n\nThe legislative body was the General Court, which began as a one-house legislature that wielded supreme authority. The General Court split in 1698 and was renamed the General Assembly, although it continued to enjoy dominance over the executive and judiciary until 1818. After the 1698 split, the General Assembly consisted of the houses of the Council and the Assembly. The Council was the more powerful of the two houses, consisting of the governor and lieutenant governor \"ex officio\", and 12 elected assistants. The 12 assistants were not elected from particular jurisdictions, but rather represented the state as a whole. The Council varied in number up to 200 members, with each town sending one or two representatives.\n\nInitially, the position of governor was somewhat symbolic. The executive had no power of pardon and no ability to veto bills passed by the General Assembly. Under the Fundamental Orders, the maximum term for the governor was two years, and he could not succeed himself. For many years, John Haynes and Edward Hopkins took turns with the position, each serving a two-year term and then rotating back to the role of lieutenant governor. The primary responsibilities of the governor were as an official statesman and a member of the legislature. Before the split into two houses, the governor acted as the moderator of the General Court. Afterwards, he held the spot on the Council.\n\nIn 1667, Sir Edmund Andros was sent by King James II to take control as governor of the Dominion of New England, provoking the famous Charter Oak incident. As a result, the office of governor was made stronger; from the time of Robert Treat in 1689 to Jonathan Trumbull in 1776, there were only nine Connecticut governors with an average of 10 years in office. Connecticut became known as \"the land of steady habits\" for re-electing the same men over and over. Various wars also strengthened the position of the governor, who organized the militia. The governorship was an extremely important role during the American Revolutionary War due to his position as commander-in-chief of the state militia.\n\nPerhaps the least influential branch of government under the Fundamental Orders was the judiciary. Until 1818, the legislative branch was the court of final resort in the state, holding appellate jurisdiction over all lower courts. If a litigant was dissatisfied with the court's decision, he simply had to go to the legislature to request a review. This often led to circumstances where a representative or assistant sat in review of a case in which he was personally interested as an attorney, litigant, or friend of one of the parties. When it became too burdensome for the entire assembly to handle appeals, the Supreme Court of Errors was created in 1784. Instead of being composed of the entire assembly, only the members of the Council sat as the Supreme Court of Errors. This change failed to alleviate many of the conflict of interest problems inherent in the appellate process.\n\nUnder political pressure, the General Assembly changed the makeup of the Supreme Court of Errors in 1806. Members of the Council no longer sat on the court; instead, the nine Superior Court judges acted as the Supreme Court of Errors when all of them sat together. This created a judicial body, but the General Assembly still retained the power to reverse decisions of the court. It also resulted in the constant situation of a Superior Court judge sitting in review of a case over which he had presided at the trial level.\n\nA notorious instance of legislative interference with the courts occurred in 1815, when Peter Lung was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. Lung filed a petition with the General Assembly and his conviction was overturned. The court retried him, convicted him—and promptly executed him. \"Lung's Case\" outraged all Connecticut judges, most notably Chief Justice Zephaniah Swift, who spoke out for judicial independence in a pamphlet the following year. Establishment of an independent judiciary became one of the central rallying cries in support of a new constitution.\n\nThe English Parliament restored the monarchy in 1660, and King Charles II assumed the English throne. Connecticut had never been officially recognized as a colony by the British government, so the General Court determined that the independence of Connecticut must be legitimized. Governor John Winthrop, Jr. was sent as an emissary to negotiate with the English government, and set sail for England on July 23, 1661. He proved successful in his mission, and the English attorney general approved a bill for incorporation of the Connecticut Charter. The document was returned to Connecticut after being officially sealed and registered, and was adopted by the General Court on October 9, 1662.\n\nThe Connecticut Charter displaced the Fundamental Orders and became the governing authority for the colony. Its practical effect was minimal on the government, however, and Connecticut continued to operate much as it had under the Fundamental Orders. The Charter did incorporate a few noteworthy changes. All colonists in Connecticut were given \"all liberties and immunities\" of the realm of England. The governor was granted the additional authority to convene a session of the General Court, while freemen were stripped of this ability. The colony's borders were to be Narragansett Bay on the east and Massachusetts on the north, while its southwestern boundary was expanded to the \"South Sea on the West\", meaning the Pacific Ocean. Connecticut's borders never approached this limitation, but the Charter did place the separate New Haven Colony within its jurisdiction. Several judges who had sentenced Charles I to death had subsequently been given refuge in New Haven, and Charles II may have been exacting revenge. After a brief dispute, New Haven decided to voluntarily join Connecticut in 1665. Today the city of New Haven still maintains Three Judges Cave on West Rock as a tribute to the judges who hid from Charles II's agents.\n\nEdmund Andros was appointed governor of New York in 1675 and promptly demanded that Connecticut Colony surrender their charter and fall under his authority. Connecticut refused to surrender it, and Andros waited until 1686, when he served a writ on the governor, again demanding the surrender of the charter; he finally went to Hartford with a band of soldiers on October 31, 1687.\n\nThe historical accuracy of what followed is somewhat uncertain, but the commonly accepted version is that Andros met with the leaders of the colony one night at the meetinghouse, expecting them to relinquish the charter. The charter was lying on a table when colonists suddenly blew out the candles, throwing the room into darkness; when the lights were reignited, it had vanished. Joseph Wadsworth fled with the document and hid it in an oak tree on the Wyllys estate, and this tree became known as the Charter Oak, a famous landmark in Connecticut. The precise details of this account have never been confirmed, but it is certain that Andros never got his hands on the charter.\n\nDespite this accomplishment, Andros briefly succeeded in forcing Connecticut to succumb to his rule, and the General Court of Connecticut declared itself dissolved. Andros's reign ended after The Glorious Revolution took place in England in November 1688 when James II was overthrown in favor of William III and Mary II. Andros was deposed from power shortly after.\n\nConnecticut was left with several options of how to restart its government. Some advocated direct ties to the crown with a royal government, while others lobbied for drafting a completely new charter, but Connecticut finally opted to return to the status quo. The government under the Charter was reinstated, including the reinstatement of all leaders previously in place before the interruption. In May 1689, the General Court issued a declaration that \"all the laws of this colony formerly made, according to the Charter, and Courts constituted in this colony for administration of justice as they were before the late interruption, shall be of full force and virtue for the future.\" After reaching this conclusion, the colony petitioned the monarchy for approval of their return to operation under the charter. In the meantime, New York Governor Benjamin Fletcher attempted to claim military authority over Connecticut. John Winthrop's son Fitz John went as the emissary to England as his father had done more than 30 years earlier in 1661, and he was successful in his mission. The Attorney General and Solicitor General reported to the king that the charter remained valid, and the king ratified it on April 19, 1694. This represented the end of serious challenges to Connecticut's autonomy.\n\nThe General Assembly formally approved the Declaration of Independence with the other colonies, especially since its own Roger Sherman had helped to draft it. The legislature declared in its resolution that Connecticut's government \"shall continue to be as established by Charter received from Charles the second, King of England, so far as an adherence to the same will be consistent with an absolute independence of this State on the Crown of Great Britain\". Even in independence, Connecticut wished to remain governed in accordance with King Charles' Charter. Eleven of the thirteen colonies had drafted state constitutions by 1786, but Connecticut elected to continue operation under the Charter. Connecticut forged ahead under this scheme of government until 1818, when the first true constitution was adopted.\n\nIn 1816, Connecticut was entirely in the control of the Federalist Party and the established Congregationalist Church. Connecticut was known as \"the land of steady habits\" for its custom of re-electing those in power until they died; the Democratic-Republican party had been organized in 1804, yet Connecticut remained the last holdout of the Federalist party in America. It was also the last state to effectively have an established state religion and a Constitution going back to the days of the British Empire. In 1815, Episcopalians, Baptists, Methodists, and members of other dissident denominations to the established Congregationalist church combined with the Democratic-Republican party to form the Toleration Party. In 1816, they held a convention and ran a slate of candidates. In 1817, they took control of the state Assembly (lower house), and elected Oliver Wolcott, Jr. as Governor and Jonathan Ingersoll as Lieutenant-governor.\n\nIn 1639, a year after the founding of the state, the Rev. Thomas Hooker gave a sermon that formed the basis of Fundamental Orders of Connecticut, the first state Constitution. Since then, an \"Anniversary Election Sermon\" was given at the Center Church in Hartford to celebrate the fusion of church and state. A procession of militia, assemblymen, and clerics from all over the state would move through Hartford; then a prominent cleric would preach a political sermon to the assembly. One measure of the event's importance is the attention given to the sometimes long-winded sermons; President Ezra Stiles of Yale preached one in 1783 that lasted five hours and was 99 pages when printed.\n\nGovernor Wolcott knew that the Toleration Party would soon have the votes to take a slim majority in the upper house, after the spring elections of 1818. He asked Episcopalian Rev. Harry Croswell to give the politically important Anniversary Election Sermon the next year, an event that signaled the end of the Standing-Order in Connecticut. Croswell was a former Federalist crusading journalist who had been sued for seditious libel by the Jefferson-party in New York in the famous \"People v. Croswell\" case. He had entirely abandoned politics for religion; he was now the Rector of the large and influential Trinity Church on the Green in New Haven. But he did not give the expected triumphant political sermon, or yet another standard election sermon of the sort that had been delivered since almost the founding of Connecticut in 1638. Instead, he gave an Election sermon in the spring of 1818 that strongly insisted on the total separation of church and state. Croswell's sermon had strong and immediate impact. It was ordered printed in an unprecedented four editions around the state. Croswell had been a newspaper editor during a time when paper was scarce and space was tight; his sermon was only 11 pages when printed, or about 30 minuets long when preached.\n\nThe General Assembly met just after the unusually short Anniversary Election Sermon was delivered and made a significant change to voting rights in Connecticut. All males who paid taxes or served in the militia were deemed eligible to vote. This eliminated the previous property requirements that had grown onerous, as more of the population moved to jobs in commerce or manufacturing rather than agriculture.\n\nEven more significantly, the General Assembly also called for a constitutional convention that year. The most important ballot cast in the General Assembly was the vote on whether only a simple majority of the legislature would be required to approve whatever constitution was ultimately drafted. Many favored requiring anywhere from a sixty to eighty percent majority for adoption of a new government.\n\nIt seems that Croswell's well-received and powerful short sermon was efficacious; those in favor of a simple majority carried the vote by 81–80. Thus a single-vote margin passed the resolution vital to the future success of the constitution that disestablished the state church, separated church and state, and ended the last theocracy in America.\n\nEach town sent a number of delegates equal to the number of representatives held in the Assembly. The convention convened in Hartford on August 26, 1818. As one of the first orders of business, a twenty-four man committee was appointed to prepare a draft constitution. The very next day, the committee returned with the Preamble and Bill of Rights. Their speed was not due to ingenuity. The draft was borrowed almost verbatim from the constitution that Mississippi had created a year earlier in 1817. After the remainder of the constitution was drafted, the convention approved the document by a two-to-one margin on September 16, 1818. The voters were given three weeks to consider the proposed constitution. A vote was held on October 5. A small majority cast their ballots in favor of the constitution, with the resolution passing 13,918 to 12,364. The ultimate vote proved the importance of requiring only a simple majority's approval, for a sixty or eighty percent requirement would not have been met.\n\nAs a result of the new constitution, the Congregational Church was finally disestablished, although Christianity remained the constitutionally favored religion. Newly received voting rights were also solidified, as the convention provided constitutional rights to vote for all males who paid taxes or had served in the militia. With the 1818 Constitution, separation of powers was finally brought to Connecticut government. An independent judiciary was approved. Both Supreme and Superior Court judges were now given life tenure to the age of seventy (this was changed to eight years in 1856). The Supreme Court of Errors was reduced to five judges, with each judge retaining a role as a Superior Court judge. Decisions of the court could no longer be appealed to the legislature.\n\nThe constitution did not significantly change the role of the executive, and the branch remained relatively weak. The executive did became a constitutional and independent part of the government, however. The governor was no longer granted a seat in the legislature. He was granted the new power of veto, but any of his vetos could be overruled by a simple majority vote from the Assembly. This made the veto power essentially useless since any bill would have to pass both houses by a majority anyway. The General Assembly retained the authority to nominate judges under the new constitution. This was not changed until 1880, when nomination powers were transferred to the governor.\n\nThe legislative branch also experienced a few changes. The Council was renamed the Senate. By constitutional mandate, half the legislative sessions were to take place in Hartford with the other half convening in New Haven. Surprisingly, the method in which towns were assigned a number of representatives was left unchanged. Each town predating the constitution retained two representatives in the lower house regardless of population, with the exception of several newer towns which were granted one vote. Many amendments were added over the years, but the Constitution of 1818 remained in operation until 1965. There was also a Constitution of 1955, but it merely incorporated prior amendments into the main body of the constitution.\n\nConnecticut currently operates under the constitution passed in 1965. The primary purpose of the 1965 constitutional convention was reapportionment of the representatives in the lower legislative house. Assigning each town one or two representatives had resulted in grossly disproportional representation. Small rural towns enjoyed equal representation with large urban communities. Apart from this major change, a majority of the language from the 1818 Constitution was reaffirmed verbatim or almost verbatim in 1965. Non-Christians were finally granted official freedom of religion in 1965, although a law had been passed by the legislature in 1843 which recognized Jews' right to worship, though these laws were largely ignored following large-scale Jewish and Catholic immigration in the last half of the 19th century. The reference to Christianity from the earlier constitution was deleted. After 1965, the Supreme Court of Errors' title was changed to the Connecticut Supreme Court. The executive obtained a significant power under the new constitution. The governor still does not enjoy the privilege of pardon, but the office was granted a more significant power of veto under the latest constitution. Instead of being able to be overridden by a second majority vote, the legislature now must muster two-thirds support in both houses to defeat a veto. Also of note, the 1965 Constitution includes a constitutional right to free public education. In addition, the most recent constitution has provided a mechanism to convene future constitutional conventions if necessary.\n\nThe Constitution of 1965 remains the supreme authority in Connecticut today. It represents the fourth distinct document in state history laying out the mechanics for its form of government. Connecticut is known as the Constitution State because of its early adoption of the Fundamental Orders in 1639, thought to be the earliest document of its kind in western civilization. Since that time Connecticut has undergone several constitutional crises and alterations, which have led the state to its present state of affairs today.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "49477975", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49477975", "title": "Impression Prods., Inc. v. Lexmark Int'l, Inc.", "text": "Impression Prods., Inc. v. Lexmark Int'l, Inc.\n\nImpression Products, Inc. v. Lexmark International, Inc., 581 U.S. ___ (2017), is a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States on the exhaustion doctrine in patent law in which the Court held that after the sale of a patented item, the patent holder cannot sue for patent infringement relating to further use of that item, even when in violation of a contract with a customer or imported from outside the United States. The case concerned a patent infringement lawsuit brought by Lexmark against Impression Products, Inc., which bought used ink cartridges, refilled them, replaced a microchip on the cartridge to circumvent a digital rights management scheme, and then resold them. Lexmark argued that as they own several patents related to the ink cartridges, Impression Products was violating their patent rights. The U.S. Supreme Court, reversing a 2016 decision of the Federal Circuit, held that the exhaustion doctrine prevented Lexmark's patent infringement lawsuit, although Lexmark could enforce restrictions on use or resale of its contracts with direct purchasers under regular contract law (but not as a patent infringement lawsuit). Besides printer and ink manufacturers, the decision of the case could affect the markets of high tech consumer goods and prescription drugs.\n\nLexmark International, Inc. makes and sells printers and toner cartridges for its printers. Lexmark owns a number of patents that cover its cartridges and their use. Lexmark sold the cartridges at issue in this case—some in the United States and some abroad.\n\nLexmark's domestic sales were in two categories. A \"Regular Cartridge\" is sold at \"list price\" and confers an absolute title and property right on the buyer. A \"Return Program Cartridge” is sold at a discount of about 20 percent, and is subject to post-sale restrictions: The buyer may not reuse the cartridge after the toner runs out and may not transfer it to anybody else. The first branch of the case turns on the legal status of these post-sale restrictions.\n\nLexmark manufactured the toner cartridges with microchips in them, which send signals to the printers indicating toner level. When the amount of toner in a cartridge falls below a certain level, the printer will not operate with that cartridge. Also, the printer will not operate with a Return Program Cartridge that has been refilled by a third party. Thus, Lexmark's technology prevented violation of the post-sale restriction against refilling the Return Program Cartridges. The Regular Cartridges do not have this anti-refill feature and can therefore be refilled and reused (but they cost 20 percent more).\n\n“To circumvent this technological measure,” however, “third parties have ‘hacked’ the Lexmark microchips. They created their own \"unauthorized replacement\" microchips that, when installed in a Return Program cartridge, fool the printer into allowing reuse of that cartridge. Various companies purchase used Return Program Cartridges from the customers who bought them from Lexmark. They replace the microchips with \"unauthorized replacement\" microchips, refill the cartridges with toner, and sell the \"re-manufactured\" cartridges to resellers such as Impression Products for marketing to consumers for use with Lexmark printers. Lexmark had previously argued in \"Lexmark International, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc.\" that replacing these microchips violated copyright law and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), but both federal and the Supreme Court have ruled against Lexmark, affirming that replacing the microchips is not in violation of copyright.\n\nThe second branch of the case involves cartridges that Lexmark sold outside the US. While some of the foreign-sold cartridges were Regular Cartridges and some were Return Program Cartridges, this branch of the case does not involve any distinction among the two types of imported cartridges.\n\nThe district court granted Impression's motion to dismiss Lexmark's claim of infringement involving the single-use cartridges Lexmark had first sold in the United States. The district court concluded that the Supreme Court in \"Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.\" found exhaustion where “the Supreme Court determined that the agreements [at issue] broadly authorized Intel [the seller] to sell the licensed products without restrictions or conditions.\" The district court said “that \"Quanta\" overruled \"Mallinckrodt\" \"sub silentio\",” and therefore \"those post-sale use restrictions do not prevent patent rights from being exhausted given that the initial sales were authorized and unrestricted.\" \n\nThe district court held, however, that the exhaustion doctrine did not apply to the cartridges that Lexmark had sold abroad. It said that international exhaustion did not apply to patents because \"Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\", which established international exhaustion in at least some cases, applied only to copyrights. The court therefore denied Impression's motion to dismiss Lexmark's claim of infringement involving the cartridges Lexmark had sold abroad.\n\nIn its \"amicus curiae\" brief, the US Government argued that \"Mallinckrodt\" had been wrongly decided in 1992 and in any case it had been overruled \"sub silentio\" in \"Quanta\". It stated:\nIn the view of the United States, the first authorized sale of a patented article in the United States wholly exhausts the patentee’s exclusive rights in that article, notwithstanding any post-sale restriction imposed by the patentee.\nThe government also argued that the decision of \"Jazz Photo Corp. v. United States International Trade Commission\" (2001) should be partially overruled in light of \"Kirtsaeng\" insofar as it held that foreign sales can \"never\" exhaust US patent rights. When the patentee neither makes nor authorizes a foreign sale, as occurred in \"Boesch v. Graff\", it is proper to say no exhaustion occurred. But when the patentee makes or authorizes a foreign sale, and fails expressly to reserve its US rights, then exhaustion should be found. In the present case, Lexmark made the foreign sales and failed to expressly reserve its US rights; therefore, the sale exhausted the patent rights.\n\nThe parties each appealed. After a three judge panel had heard oral argument the Federal Circuit \"sua sponte\" set the case for argument \"en banc\" in the first instance and invited the filing of \"amicus curiae\" briefs.\n\nJudge Taranto, writing for a 10-2 majority, reaffirmed both of the prior Federal Circuit rulings. In summary, the court held:\n\nFirst, we adhere to the holding of \"Mallinckrodt, Inc. v. Medipart, Inc.\" that a patentee, when selling a patented article subject to a single-use/no-resale restriction that is lawful and clearly communicated to the purchaser, does not by that sale give the buyer, or downstream buyers, the resale/reuse authority that has been expressly denied. Such resale or reuse, when contrary to the known, lawful limits on the authority conferred at the time of the original sale, remains unauthorized and therefore remains infringing conduct under the terms of § 271. Under Supreme Court precedent, a patentee may preserve its § 271 rights through such restrictions when licensing others to make and sell patented articles; \"Mallinckrodt\" held that there is no sound legal basis for denying the same ability to the patentee that makes and sells the articles itself. We find \"Mallinckrodt\"’s principle to remain sound after the Supreme Court’s decision in \"Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.\" . . .<br><br>\n\nSecond, we adhere to the holding of \"Jazz Photo Corp. v. International Trade Comm’n\", that a U.S. patentee, merely by selling or authorizing the sale of a U.S.-patented article abroad, does not authorize the buyer to import the article and sell and use it in the United States, which are infringing acts in the absence of patentee-conferred authority. \"Jazz Photo\"’s no-exhaustion ruling recognizes that foreign markets under foreign sovereign control are not equivalent to the U.S. markets under U.S. control in which a U.S. patentee’s sale presumptively exhausts its rights in the article sold. A buyer may still rely on a foreign sale as a defense to infringement, but only by establishing an express or implied license—a defense separate from exhaustion, as \"Quanta\" holds—based on patentee communications or other circumstances of the sale. We conclude that \"Jazz Photo\"’s no-exhaustion principle remains sound after the Supreme Court’s decision in \"Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\", in which the Court did not address patent law or whether a foreign sale should be viewed as conferring authority to engage in otherwise-infringing domestic acts. \"Kirtsaeng\" is a copyright case holding that 17 U.S.C. § 109(a) entitles owners of copyrighted articles to take certain acts “without the authority” of the copyright holder. There is no counterpart to that provision in the Patent Act, under which a foreign sale is properly treated as neither conclusively nor even presumptively exhausting the U.S. patentee’s rights in the United States.\n\nIn this part of its opinion, the Federal Circuit reaffirmed its \"Mallincrodt\" decision and rejected contentions that \"Quanta\" had silently overruled it.\n\nThe court began by distinguishing the Patent Act's and Copyright Act's respective approaches to infringement. in 17 U.S.C. § 109(a) the Copyright Act says, \"Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106(3),\" defining infringement by selling, a purchaser \"is entitled, without the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession\" of a purchased copy of a work. In contrast, the Patent Act contains no exhaustion provision. Therefore, the Patent Act requires a \"conferral of 'authority' by the patentee . . . in order for the actions listed in § 271(a) not to constitute infringement.\" This means there must be \"permission from the patentee\" to avoid infringement. The court does not accept exhaustion as a form of \"constructive\" permission. Hence, if the patentee places explicit limits or conditions on its permission, they qualify the scope of the permission. This has the effect of limiting the common law.\n\nThe court turned to the \"General Talking Pictures\" decision, which holds \"that Lexmark would not have exhausted its patent rights in those cartridges, upon the manufacturing licensee’s sale (the first sale), if a buyer with knowledge of the restrictions resold or reused them in violation of the restrictions.\" Although the government in its \"amicus curiae\" brief and defendant Impression argue \"that a different result is required—that Lexmark automatically lost its patent rights—simply because Lexmark sold the Return Program cartridges itself, subject to the same communicated restriction, rather than having left the manufacture and sale to others under license,\" the court does not accept that:\n\nWe conclude otherwise, as we did in \"Mallinckrodt\" and subsequent decisions. A sale made under a clearly communicated, otherwise-lawful restriction as to post-sale use or resale does not confer on the buyer and a subsequent purchaser the \"authority\" to engage in the use or resale that the restriction precludes. And there is no sound reason, and no Supreme Court precedent, requiring a distinction that gives less control to a practicing-entity patentee that makes and sells its own product than to a non-practicing-entity patentee that licenses others to make and sell the product.\n\nThe court turned to the \"Quanta\" decision and found it inapplicable to the present issues. \"'Quanta did not involve a patentee’s sale at all, let alone one subject to a restriction or, more particularly, a single-use/no-resale restriction.\" Rather, \"Quanta\" involved a patentee's (LGE's) license to a manufacturer (Intel) that sold to the accused infringer (Quanta). LGE had not limited Intel's license to manufacture the patented product, although it imposed contractual obligations on Intel. \"No conditions limited Intel’s authority to sell products substantially embodying the patents.\" The Federal Circuit emphasized: \"There were no patentee sales, and there were no restrictions on the sales made by the licensee.\" Those facts were removed from the case at bar. Thus the \"Quanta\" \"Court’s discussion of that issue does not undermine \"Mallinckrodt\" ’s ruling that a patentee can preserve its patent rights through restrictions on its sales.\" The Federal Circuit also emphasized as significant the failure of the \"Quanta\" Court to explicitly repudiate \"Mallinckrodt\" despite the fact that in its \"amicus\" brief \"the government prominently featured an argument that \"Mallinckrodt\" was incorrect and should be repudiated.\"\n\nThe court then turned to the prior Supreme Court cases. Reviewing them, it found that although they used sweeping language that a patentee's sale of the patented product placed it beyond the reach of the patent, so that no post-sale restriction could be enforced under the patent laws, that language went beyond the actual facts of the cases. First, the sales were in most cases without any condition or restriction on what the buyer might do with the product. Second, in the cases where an explicit condition or restriction was imposed, the case involved a tie-in or a price-fix.\n\nThe Court conceded that in the \"General Electric\" case, the Supreme Court had said: “It is well settled, as already said, that where a patentee makes the patented article, and sells it, he can exercise no future control over what the purchaser may wish to do with the article after his purchase. It has passed beyond the scope of the patentee’s rights.” But that case involved an antitrust challenge to GE's distribution of lamps that did not meet that description. The case involved price restrictions on a licensed manufacturer. The Federal Circuit then explained that the word \"settled\" in the Supreme Court's statement had a special, narrow meaning:\n\"We read that language to deem 'settled' only what was settled in the cited precedents—a patentee’s sales \"without restrictions\" exhaust patent rights in the item sold.\" Thus, the Supreme Court's sweeping exhaustion language applies precedentially only to cases in which either the sale was without condition or restriction or else the sale was made with a tie-in or price-fixing condition. \"But the Court did not rule that all restrictions on a patentee’s sale were ineffective to preserve the patentee’s patent-law rights.\"\n\nSimilarly, in \"United States v. Univis Lens Co.\", the Supreme Court's sweeping language must now be limited to the factual context of the case:\n\nMoreover, although some language in \"Univis\", like language in other decisions in the area, can be taken out of context and read as going beyond the specific restrictions involved, the most the Court ruled, even as to patent law all by itself, was that a vertical price-control restriction was ineffective to preserve patent rights after sales of articles embodying the patents. While \"Univis\" is controlling on what it decided on the issues before it, we do not think it appropriate to give broad effect to language in \"Univis\", taken out of context, to support an otherwise-unjustified conclusion here on a question not faced there.\n\nThe Federal Circuit therefore drew this conclusion from the past series of Supreme Court cases on exhaustion:\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we think that the best lesson to draw from the Supreme Court’s precedents, as applied to the question before us, is that a patentee may preserve its patent rights by otherwise-proper restrictions when it makes and sells patented articles itself and not only when it contracts out manufacturing and sales.\n\nThe Federal Circuit returned to the common law and Lord Coke's commentary on it. Again, the court insisted that Congress had overridden the common law's prohibitions on post-sale restraints, in order to promote technological progress:\n\n[W]hatever considerations might go into a jurisdiction’s choice as to the background rule for personal property in general, lawmaking authorities may reasonably make different choices for particular kinds of property. Notably, as to intellectual property in its various forms, Congress, implementing the Constitution, has long deemed it important to incentivize creation and disclosure through grants to the creator of rights to exclude others for a time. . . . That overriding legislative prescription removes the patented-article sale from the scope of Lord Coke’s 1628 description of his country’s general judicially fashioned property law. . . . In short, notwithstanding Lord Coke’s description of English general personal-property judge-made law, the patent-specific statutory analysis must govern here.\n\nThe court then turned to what it called \"the likely real-world consequences of one answer or another to the exhaustion question presented here.\" The court noted that in \"Kirtsaeng\" the Supreme Court had envisioned serious adverse effects on competition unless Coke's 1628 property law rules were followed. The Federal Circuit said that did not apply to patents:\n\n[W]e see no basis for predicting the extreme, lop-sided impacts the Court found plausible in \"Kirtsaeng\" in different circumstances. \"Mallinckrodt\" has been the governing case law since 1992 and has been reiterated in subsequent precedent. And yet we have been given no reliable demonstration of widespread problems not being solved in the marketplace. Given \"General Talking Pictures\", the only question is about patentees’ ability to do for their own sales what they already can do by contracting out their manufacturing and sales. Regarding the specific scenario we are addressing today—in which the patentee has sought to preserve its patent rights by conditioning its first sale on a single-use/no-resale restriction of which the accused infringer had adequate notice at the time of purchase—we have been given no proof of a significant problem with enforcing patent rights.\n\nFurthermore, the Federal Circuit maintained, the conduct challenged here can have benefits. Under Lexmark's program, customers who agree to the restriction pay a lower price than those who do not. It could be that the companies that refill the cartridges use inferior products that could harm the Lexmark machines, which \"could harm Lexmark’s reputation.\" To assume that the restrictions are illegitimate would run counter to the trends \"over the last four decades, that have displaced the strict condemnation of various vertical restrictions that characterized\" earlier antitrust and patent-misuse law in the first part of the twentieth century. “Field-of-use, territorial, and other limitations on intellectual property licenses may serve procompetitive ends by allowing the licensor to exploit its property as efficiently and effectively as possible.” Therefore, the court concluded it is appropriate to apply to post-sale restrictions the same tolerance that the \"General Talking Pictures\" doctrine accords limitations in manufacturing licenses.\n\nIn this part of its opinion, the Federal Circuit reaffirmed it \"Jazz Photo\" opinion and rejected contentions that \"Kirtsaeng\" had undermined the basis for \"Jazz Photo\". The Federal Circuit insisted that \"\"Kirtsaeng\" says nothing about patent law.\"\n\nThe court emphasized the differences between patent law and copyright law. For example, patent law gives patentees an exclusive right to use of the invention but copyright law gives no general exclusionary right as to use (it gives exclusive public performance and display \"use\" rights, but not others). Also, it is much more costly and time-consuming to obtain a patent than a copyright. The court did not explain, however, the way that or other differences between copyrights and patents called for contrary results as to international exhaustion.\n\nThe court did say that the US patent statute gives patentees the reward available from \"sales in American markets, not from sales in foreign markets.\" A sale in a foreign market therefore does not furnish a proper basis for finding exhaustion. \"American markets differ substantially from markets in many other countries, and not just because of disparities in wealth that can lead to dramatically different prices\" in this country and abroad (as was the case in \"Kirtsaeng\"). \"Government policies differ dramatically, including policies on price regulation and, most particularly, policies on the availability and scope of patent protection.\" The court did not explain further, however, whether and how such dramatic differences in policy applied to the toner cartridges at issue in the present case.\n\nThe court then turned to the only Supreme Court case on foreign exhaustion, \"Boesch v. Graff\". In that case, Graff was the assignee of a US patent. Boesch bought the product from a German supplier who had a prior-user right under German law to make and sell the product, because the supplier had begun activity before the application for the German counterpart patent was filed. The US assignee and the inventor had no connection with Boesch. When Graff imported the product into the US, Boesch sued for infringement. The US courts found Boesch liable. The rights that Boesch had under German law did not entitle him to import the product into the US. That is governed by US law. The US patentee had never \"received any royalty or given any license to use the patented article in any part of the United States.\"\nAccordingly, the court held, a foreign sale does not of its own force authorize importation into the US.\n\nThis does not mean, however, that a patentee by its conduct cannot waive its US rights, be estopped from asserting them, or be found to have granted an implied license.\n\nThe court expressed concern that overruling \"Jazz Photo\" would harm the US drug industry:\n\nThere seems to be no dispute that U.S.-patented medicines are often sold outside the United States at substantially lower prices than those charged here and, also, that the practice could be disrupted by the increased arbitrage opportunities that would come from deeming U.S. rights eliminated by a foreign sale made or authorized by the U.S. patentee.There seems to be no dispute that U.S.-patented medicines are often sold outside the United States at substantially lower prices than those charged here and, also, that the practice could be disrupted by the increased arbitrage opportunities that would come from deeming U.S. rights eliminated by a foreign sale made or authorized by the U.S. patentee.\n\nFinally, the court rejected a proposal that exhaustion should be presumed unless the patentee express states that it reserves its US rights. Foreign governments might \"prohibit sellers from stating reservations of rights that would make importation into and sale in the United States more difficult.\" Also: \"Intermediary companies between the foreign purchase and the importation into the United States may be created that make it difficult for the U.S. patentee to carry an affirmative burden of proving adequate notice of reservations attached to a foreign-sold article.\"\n\nJudge Dyk, joined by Judge Hughes, dissented from both branches of the court's exhaustion analysis. Judge Dyk summarized his dissent in these terms:\n\nI would overrule our decision in \"Mallinckrodt\" as inconsistent with governing Supreme Court authority and overrule \"Jazz Photo\" to the extent that it imposes a blanket ban on foreign exhaustion. I would recognize foreign exhaustion where the U.S. rights holder has not notified the buyer of its retention of the U.S. patent rights.\n\nIn this part of the dissent, Judge Dyk argued that the majority had misunderstood the Supreme Court's exhaustion jurisprudence in order to substitute its own ideas of the proper balance between patent rights and public rights. He began by saying:\n\nFirst, I agree with the government that \"Mallinckrodt\" was wrong when decided, and in any event cannot be reconciled with the Supreme Court’s recent decision in \"Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.\" We exceed our role as a subordinate court by declining to follow the explicit domestic exhaustion rule announced by the Supreme Court.\n\nHe argued that since 1850 the Supreme Court has held that a sale by the patentee or its licensee exhausts all patent rights. In such cases, \"The question of whether the seller has 'authorized' the buyer to use or resell the item is simply irrelevant.\" Post-sale restrictions could not be enforced under federal patent law. The only Supreme Court case to depart from that principle was \"Henry v. A.B. Dick Co.\", and it was explicitly overruled five years later by \"Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co.\" The principle of the overruled \"Dick\" case that a patentee could impost a post-sale restriction by giving a buyer notice of it was \"the same as the panel’s holding in \"Mallinckrodt\" and the majority’s holding in this case.\"\n\nHe insisted that the majority opinion misread the \"Motion Picture Patents\" decision by asserting \"that it only 'held particular restrictions improper' . . . but 'did not rule that all restrictions on a patentee’s sale were ineffective to preserve the patentee’s patent-law rights.'\" He explained:\n\nThat is not accurate. \"Motion Picture Patents\" did not leave behind the remnants of \"A.B. Dick\"—minus tie-ins and resale price maintenance. To the contrary, the Court in \"Motion Picture Patents\" found that “[t]he patent law furnishes no warrant for” the restrictions imposed by the patent owner.\n\nLater cases, such as \"Quanta\", confirmed this \"broad patent exhaustion rule [in \"Motion Picture Patents\"] and left no room for a resurrection of \"A.B. Dick\".\"\n\nHe next turned to the majority's referenced to \"conditional sales\" and \"unconditional sales,\" and said that the majority misconstrued the terms. \"Conditional sales,\" he said, as used in pre-\"Mallinckrodt\" case law referred only to the retention of title for a security interest in installment purchases. \"In other words, a sale with restrictions could nonetheless be an 'unconditional' sale in which title passes, with the restrictions invalid under the patent laws because of exhaustion.\"\n\nHe then criticized the majority for making up special rules for patent cases that differed from the common law and general legal principles, citing Supreme Court admonitions not to do that--\"The Supreme Court has repeatedly instructed us not to ignore traditional legal principles to fashion rules 'unique to patent disputes.'\"\n\nFinally, Judge Dyk took issue on multiple grounds with the majority's efforts to distinguish and limit the Supreme Court's rulings. \"The majority’s justifications for refusing to follow Supreme Court authority establishing the exhaustion rule misconceive our role as a subordinate court.\" Each justification in the majority decision was unsupportable, he said.\n\n\n\nDyk concluded his discussion of domestic exhaustion with the statement: \"There is, in sum, no colorable basis for the majority’s failure to follow the exhaustion rule for domestic sales as articulated by the Court in \"Quanta\" and numerous other cases.\"\n\nIn this part of the dissent, Judge Dyk argued for a nuanced balance that called for different results depending on whether the patentee was responsible for the sale abroad that was alleged to trigger exhaustion.\n\nHe began by pointing out that because Lexmark's foreign sales were made without any restrictions or reservations, \"even under the majority’s cramped view of exhaustion, there is no question that the sales would have exhausted Lexmark’s domestic patent rights. The issue is whether the foreign location of the sale should lead to a different result, as we previously held in \"Jazz Photo\".\"\n\nHe then turned to \"the centerpiece of the majority’s holding that there is a doctrinal blanket ban on foreign exhaustion, namely the Supreme Court’s decision in \"Boesch v. Graff\". But \"\"Boesch\" announced no such blanket ban,\" he said. \"It did not even involve an authorized sale by the holder of U.S. patent rights but rather a sale by a third party under a foreign law’s prior use exception.\" But \"\"Boesch\" does not apply here because the foreign sales were made by Lexmark.\"\n\nIn every US lower court decision before \"Jazz Photo\": \"When the sale was made by an entity not holding U.S. patent rights, as in \"Boesch\", or when the authorized foreign seller clearly reserved U.S. rights, there was no exhaustion.\" In contrast, \"where the foreign sale was made by a seller holding U.S. patent rights without a contractual reservation of U.S. rights, exhaustion occurred as a result of an authorized foreign sale.\"\n\nDyk maintained that \"\"Kirtsaeng\" provides significant guidance and cannot be dismissed as simply a copyright case, or as limited to the 'first sale' provision of the Copyright Act.\" Rather, the policies that animated \"Kirtsaeng\" typically apply to patent exhaustion. But because in some cases a difference may be significant, there should be abalanced approach. Dyk argued for \"put[ting] the burden on the U.S. rights holder to provide notice of a reservation of U.S. rights to the purchaser.\" Thus, he \"would recognize foreign exhaustion where the U.S. rights holder has not notified the buyer of its retention of the U.S. patent rights.\"\n\nIn March 2016, Impression filed a petition for \"certiorari\" in the U.S. Supreme Court. Impression presented these questions in its petition:\n\nOn June 20, 2016, the Court invited the Solicitor General to file briefs in this case expressing the views of the United States. In October 2016, the government filed the requested \"amicus curiae\" brief. It recommended grant of \"certiorari\" on both questions. The brief argues that the \"Federal Circuit's decision misreads\" the Supreme Court's precedents and \"would substantially erode the exhaustion doctrine.\" The Supreme Court granted \"certiorari\" on December 2, 2016 and heard oral argument in the case on March 21, 2017. The Court published its decisions on May 30, 2017.\n\nA unanimous Court found that Lexmark exhausted its patent rights upon first sale domestically, even with the single-use/no-resale restrictions imposed by Lexmark in contracts with its customers, although such restrictions could be enforced under contract law. The Court noted that the exhaustion doctrine has a long history and that any change would have significant effects on commerce in the modern world, noting that \"extending the patent rights beyond the first sale would clog the channels of commerce, with little benefit from the extra control that the patentees retain,\" noting that complex modern supply chains can involve large numbers of patents. Chief Justice Roberts, in his opinion, compared the situation to automobile repair shops: \"The business works because the shop can rest assured that, so long as those bringing in the cars own them, the shop is free to repair and resell those vehicles. That smooth flow of commerce would sputter if companies that make the thousands of parts that go into a vehicle could keep their patent rights after the first sale.\"\n\nSeven justices joined the Court's opinion extending that reasoning to items imported from abroad. Lexmark had argued, and the Federal Circuit agreed, that sale abroad \"does not trigger patent exhaustion unless the patentee 'expressly or implicitly transfers or licenses' its rights.\" The Court, however, ruled that \"[a]n authorized sale outside the United States, just as one within the United States, exhausts all rights under the Patent Act.\" The Court relied on its 2013 decision in \"Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\" on a nearly identical issue under copyright law. Because the underlying statute was not clear as to its geographical scope, the Court in \"Kirtsaeng\" decided that, because the statute was based in the common law exhaustion doctrine, which is not limited in geographic extent, the statute at issue was therefore not intended to be limited to only U.S. sales. Applying the same principle to patent law, which historically has a close connection with copyright law, was \"straightforward\" and \"the bond between [copyright and patent law] leaves no room for a rift on the question of international exhaustion\".\n\nJustice Ginsburg dissented from the Court's holding with respect to imported items. Adhering to substantially the same reasoning of her dissent in \"Kirtsaeng\", Justice Ginsburg argued that because patent law is territorial and the sale of an item abroad is \"independent[] of the U.S. patent system, it makes little sense to say that such a sale exhausts an inventor's U.S. patent rights.\" She would have upheld the Federal Circuit's decision that sale abroad does not exhaust a patentee's rights in the United States.\n\nRobert M. Gerstein concluded that further review in the Supreme Court was likely:\nGiven the Supreme Court’s interest in patent cases, a vigorous dissent in \"Lexmark\" that relies on a number of Supreme Court precedents, including \"Quanta\" and \"Kirtsaeng\", and the position of the Justice Department that \"Quanta\" overruled \"Mallinckrodt\", it would not be surprising to see the Supreme Court take up Lexmark in its next term.\n\nJeff C. Dodd and Matthew J. Dowd viewed the decision as an affirmation of strong patent rights:\n\"Lexmark\" embraces a very strong view of patent rights and a narrow view of the scope of exhaustion. It affirms that patent holders have wide latitude to segment and control distribution in the market channels for products covered by patents. This latitude is particularly wide with respect to limiting the import into the United States of patented goods sold in authorized sales in foreign markets even where restrictions on resale were not proven to have been communicated to foreign buyers. Even so, the court left open the possibility that foreign sales, under the right circumstances, may incorporate an implied license to import and use the product within the United States.\n\nKevin J. Cukierski and Adam H. Masia see the decision as \"pro-patent owner\" but warn again premature celebration:\nBut take caution—it is likely that the Supreme Court will be asked to hear the case. Given the tension between this case and the Supreme Court’s language in \"Quanta\" and \"Kirtsaeng\", along with the discord at the district court level and among commentators before the Federal Circuit’s decision, there’s a good chance the Supreme Court will do so. Until the Supreme Court has its say, you should take precautions in case the Supreme Court takes an expansive view of patent exhaustion and decides to remove these exceptions.\n\nAnother commentator (unsigned comment) indicated a skeptical view of the Federal Circuit's tendency to march to a different drummer. After quoting Judge Dyk's admonition, “We exceed our role as a subordinate court by declining to follow the explicit domestic exhaustion rule announced by the Supreme Court,” he (or she) observed:\nFor present purposes, it is simply worth noting that the Federal Circuit appears to be inching closer again to the concept that patent law is simply a unique beast, with unique rules and requirements. The Supreme Court has taken a skeptical view of that approach in the past. And may well again.\n\nPaul Jahn, Rufus Pichler and Lincoln Lo raise many questions (mostly about \"clear communication\") about what the \"Lexmark\" majority opinion left unresolved:\n\n\nGregory A. Castanias, Kelsey I. Nix, and Daniel Kazhdan also point to unresolved issues over which patent owners \"must still be cautious\":\n\"Lexmark\" explicitly left open several fact-specific questions, including (i) what happens if someone acquires a patented article with \"less than actual knowledge\" of the restrictions placed on the original sale by the patent owner and (ii) when would a foreign buyer have an \"implied license\" to sell in the United States, independent of patent exhaustion. These issues will surely be raised in future cases.\n\nDennis Crouch, in \"Patently-O\" commented on the issues and provided a summary of the merits briefs filed in the Supreme Court as of January 31, 2017. Crouch opposed the Federal Circuit's ruling on these grounds:\nWith personal property courts long ago rejected servitudes (such as use and resale restrictions) that bind subsequent purchasers. Unlike real property, personal property moves and is often transferred without substantial paperwork or record-keeping, and allowing a set of unique restrictions has the potential of gumming up the marketplace. The Federal Circuit in this case went all the way to the other side — holding that the presumption in foreign sales is that no US patent rights are exhausted. I purchased my last couple of smart phones through the used market – and have also repaired them several times. Under the law, I probably should have taken steps to ensure that all of the original equipment manufacturers affirmatively granted repair and resale rights. Coming together, the Federal Circuit’s approach here has the potential to limit the market for the repair and reselling of goods. I would suggest that those activities are incredibly beneficial to our society in terms of resource allocation and avoiding waste as well as empowering citizens and avoiding anticompetitive market behavior.\n\n"}
{"id": "511459", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=511459", "title": "In camera", "text": "In camera\n\nIn camera (; Latin: \"in a chamber\") is a legal term that means \"in private\". The same meaning is sometimes expressed in the English equivalent: in chambers. Generally, \"in-camera\" describes court cases, parts of it, or process where the public and press are not allowed to observe the procedure or process. \"In-camera\" is the opposite of trial in open court where all parties and witnesses testify in a public courtroom, and attorneys publicly present their arguments to the trier of fact.\n\nEntire cases may be heard \"in-camera\" when, for example, matters of national security are involved. \"In-camera\" review by a judge may be used during otherwise open trials—for example, to protect trade secrets or where one party asserts privilege (such as attorney–client privileged communications). This lets the judge review documents in private to determine if revelation of documents in open court will be allowed.\n\nIn United States courts in-camera review describes a process or procedure where a judge privately looks at confidential, sensitive, or private information to determine what, if any, information may be used by a party or made public. An \"in camera review\" may be at someone's request (such as counsel in the case), or by order of the court. \n\nAn example of \"in-camera review\" by the court: a defendant prosecuted for the alleged murder of a high school student asserts his was an act of self-defense, a last resort after the deceased physically assaulted the defendant. Witnesses tell investigators and lawyers that the victim \"was always getting into fights in school\" and frequently had to visit the principal's office. The defendant seeks to obtain the deceased's high school files to see if there's anything proving the deceased fighting at school. A party for the deceased's family might argue against disclosure on the basis that school records which are presumably private should not be provided to the defendant. While a judge might acknowledge the general presumption, the court might permit the defendant limited use at trial any school records that may establish the deceased's physically aggressive tendencies. \n\nIn this example, before allowing disclosure of files to the defendant, or for revelation of the records to the jury, the judge would \"in camera\" inspect the deceased's high school records to determine what records, if any, the judge will release to the defendant. Note: The judge has complete authority on an in-camera review. The judge may disallow use of some or all of the records reviewed, limit use or purpose, and to order a party to take all steps necessary to keep private and confidential the information released. \n\n\"In-camera\" can also describe closed board meetings that cover information not recorded in the minutes or divulged to the public. Such sessions may discuss personnel, financial, or other sensitive decisions that must be kept secret (e.g., a proposed merger or strategic change the organization does not want disclosed to competitors). It can also apply to diplomatic and political affairs, such as during the American Constitutional Convention in 1787 when the drafting of the Constitution of the United States was discussed in such strict privacy so delegates could negotiate in full confidence that they were free to reconsider particular positions as necessary without embarrassment or political repercussions with their constituents. \n\n\"In camera\" may also mean the portion of a graduate level thesis examination that includes only the examining committee and the student. This follows a presentation by the student that the public may attend.\n\n"}
{"id": "1523930", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1523930", "title": "Intangible property", "text": "Intangible property\n\nIntangible property, also known as incorporeal property, describes something which a person or corporation can have ownership of and can transfer ownership to another person or corporation, but has no physical substance, for example brand identity or knowledge/intellectual property. It generally refers to statutory creations such as copyright, trademarks, or patents. It excludes tangible property like real property (land, buildings, and fixtures) and personal property (ships, automobiles, tools, etc.). In some jurisdictions intangible property are referred to as \"choses in action\". Intangible property is used in distinction to tangible property. It is useful to note that there are two forms of intangible property: legal intangible property (which is discussed here) and competitive intangible property (which is the source from which legal intangible property is created but cannot be owned, extinguished, or transferred). Competitive intangible property disobeys the intellectual property test of voluntary extinguishment and therefore results in the sources that create intellectual property (knowledge in its source form, collaboration, process-engagement, etc.) escaping quantification.\n\nGenerally, ownership of intangible property gives the owner a set of legally enforceable rights over reproduction of personal property containing certain content. For example, a copyright owner can control the reproduction of the work forming the copyright. However, the intangible property forms a set of rights separate from the tangible property that carries the rights. For example, the owner of a copyright can control the printing of books containing the content, but the book itself is personal property which can be bought and sold without concern over the rights of the copyright holder.\n\nIn English law and other Commonwealth legal systems, intangible property is traditionally divided in \"pure intangibles\" (such as debts, intellectual property rights and goodwill) and \"documentary intangibles\", which obtain their character through the medium of a document (such as a bill of lading, promissory note or bill of exchange). The recent rise of electronic documents has blurred the distinction between pure intangibles and documentary intangibles.\n\n"}
{"id": "14113060", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14113060", "title": "Italian irredentism in Nice", "text": "Italian irredentism in Nice\n\nItalian irredentism in Nice was the political movement supporting the annexation of the County of Nice to the Kingdom of Italy. The term was coined by Italian Irredentists.\n\nAccording to some Italian nationalists and fascists like Ermanno Amicucci, Italian- and Ligurian-speaking populations of the County of Nice () formed the majority of the county's population until the mid-19th century. However, French nationalists and linguists argue that both Occitan and Ligurian languages were spoken in the County of Nice.\n\nDuring the Italian unification, in 1860, the House of Savoy allowed the Second French Empire to annex Nice from the Kingdom of Sardinia in exchange for French support of its quest to unify Italy. Consequently, the Niçois were excluded from the Italian unification movement and the region has since become primarily French-speaking.\n\nThe region around \"Nicaea\", as Nice was known in Latin, was inhabited by the Ligures until its occupation by the Roman Empire. The Ligures were conquered by Augustus and, according to Theodor Mommsen, fully Romanised by the 4th century, when the invasions of the Migration Period began.\n\nThe Franks conquered the region after the fall of Rome, and the local Romance language speaking populations became integrated within the County of Provence, with a period of independence as a maritime republic (1108–1176). In 1388, the commune of Nice sought the protection of the Duchy of Savoy, and Nice continued to be controlled, directly or indirectly, by the Savoy monarchs right up until 1860.\n\nDuring this time, the maritime strength of Nice rapidly increased until it was able to cope with the Barbary pirates. Fortifications were largely extended by the House of Savoy and the roads of the city and surrounding region improved. Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy, abolished the use of Latin and established Italian as the official language of Nice in 1561.\n\nConquered in 1792 by the armies of the French First Republic, the County of Nice was part of France until 1814; but after that year it was placed under the protection of the Kingdom of Sardinia by the Congress of Vienna.\n\nBy a treaty concluded in 1860 between the Sardinian king and Napoleon III, the County of Nice was again ceded to France, along with Savoy, as a territorial reward for French assistance in the Second Italian War of Independence against Austria, which saw Lombardy unified with Piedmont-Sardinia.\n\nGiuseppe Garibaldi, born in Nice, strongly opposed the cession to France, arguing that the plebiscite that ratified the treaty was not \"universal\" and contained irregularities. He was elected at the \"French National Assembly\" for Nice with 70% of the votes in 1871, and quickly promoted the withdrawal of France from Nice, but the elections were invalidated by the French authorities.\n\nIn 1871/72 there were popular riots in the city (called by Garibaldi \"Vespri Nizzardi\" or Nizzard Vespers), promoted by the \"Garibaldini\" in favour of unification with the Kingdom of Italy. Fifteen Nizzardi Italians were processed and condemned for these riots, supported by the 'Nizzardo Republican Party'\nMore than 11,000 Nizzardi Italians refused to be French and moved to Italy (mainly Turin and Genoa) after 1861.\nThe French government closed the Italian language newspapers \"Diritto di Nizza\" and \"Voce di Nizza\" in 1861, and \"Il Pensiero di Nizza\" in 1895. In these newspapers wrote the most famous writers in Italian language of Nice: Giuseppe Bres, Henri Sappia, Giuseppe André.\n\nOne of the most renowned Nizzardo Italians was Luciano Mereu, a follower of Garibaldi. On November 1870 he was temporarily exiled from Nice together with the \"Garibaldini\" Adriano Gilli, Carlo Perino and Alberto Cougnet. Later, Luciano Mereu was elected in 1871 as counselor of Nizza under Mayor Augusto Raynaud (1871–1876) and was member of the \"Commissione garibaldina di Nizza\" with Donato Rasteu, its President until 1885.\n\nBenito Mussolini considered the annexation of Nice to be one of his main targets. In 1942, during World War II, after Operation Torch (the landing of the Allies in North Africa), the former County of Nice was occupied and administered by Italy from November 11, 1942 until September 8, 1943.\n\nThe Italian occupation government was far less severe than that of Vichy France. Therefore, thousands of Jews took refuge there. For a while the city became an important centre for various Jewish organizations. However, when the Italians signed the Armistice of Cassibile with the Allies, German troops invaded the region on September 8, 1943 and initiated brutal raids. Alois Brunner, the SS official for Jewish affairs, was placed at the head of units formed to search out Jews. Within five months, 5,000 Jews were caught and deported.\n\nThe area was returned to France following the war and in 1947, the areas of La Brigue and Tende, which had remained Italian after 1860 were ceded to France. Thereafter, a quarter of the Nizzardi Italians living in that mountainous area moved to Piedmont and Liguria in Italy (mainly from the Roya Valley and Tenda).\n\nToday, after a sustained process of Francization conducted since 1861, the former county is predominantly French-speaking. Only along the coast around Menton and in the mountains around Tende there are still some native speakers of the original Intemelio dialect of Ligurian.\n\nCurrently the area is part of the Alpes-Maritimes department of France.\n\nBefore the year 1000 the area of Nice was part of the Ligurian League, under the Republic of Genoa; the population spoke a dialect different from the one of western Liguria, whereas in the eastern part the language, which today is called Intemelio was spoken. The medieval writer and poet Dante Alighieri wrote in his \"Divine Comedy\" that the Var near Nice was the western limit of the Italian Liguria.\n\nAround the 12th century, Nice came under the control of the French Capetian House of Anjou. They favoured the immigration of peasants from Provence, who brought with them their Occitan language. From 1388 to 1860, the County of Nice was under Savoyard rule and remained connected to the Italian dialects and peninsula. In the fantastic linguistics and historical inventions of the Italian fascists, in this era, the people of the mountainous areas of the upper Var Valley started to lose their former Ligurian linguistic characteristics and began to adopt Provençal influences. They believe that in those centuries the local Niçard dialect became distinct from the Monégasque of the Principality of Monaco.\n\nTraditionally, Italian linguists maintained that Niçard originated as a Ligurian dialect. On the other hand, French linguists argue that Niçard is a dialect of Occitan while conceding that Monégasque is a dialect of Ligurian. However, Sue Wright notes that before the Kingdom of Sardinia ceded the County of Nice to France, \"Nice was not French-speaking before the annexation but underwent a shift to French in a short time... and it is surprising that the local Italian dialect, the Nissart, disappeared quickly from the private domain.\" She also wrote that one of the main reasons of the disappearance of the Italian language in the County was because \"(m)any of the administrative class under Piedmont-Savoy ruler, the soldiers; jurists; civil servants and professionals, who used Italian in their working lives, moved [back] to Piedmont, after the annexation and their places and roles were taken by newcomers from France\".\n\nIndeed, immediately after 1861, the French government closed all the Italian language newspapers and more than 11,000 Nizzardi Italians moved to the Kingdom of Italy. The dimension of this exodus can be deducted by the fact that in the Savoy census of 1858, Nice had only 44,000 inhabitants. In 1881, \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"Before the French annexation, the Niçois were quite as much Italian as the Genoese and their dialect was if anything, nearer the Tuscan, than is the harsh dialect of Genoa.\n\nGiuseppe Garibaldi defined his \"Nizzardo\" as an Italian dialect, albeit with strong similarities to Occitan and with some French influences, and for this reason promoted the union of Nice to the Kingdom of Italy.\n\nToday some scholars, like the German Werner Forner, the French Jean-Philippe Dalbera and the Italian Giulia Petracco Sicardi, agree that the Niçard has some characteristics - phonetic, lexical and morphological - that are typical of western Ligurian. The French scholar Bernard Cerquiglini pinpoints in his \"Les langues de France\" the actual existence of a Ligurian minority in Tende, Roquebrune-Cap-Martin and Menton.\n\nAnother reduction in the number of the Nizzardi Italians happened after World War II, when defeated Italy was forced to surrender to France the small mountainous area of the County of Nice, that had been retained in 1860. From the \"Val di Roia\", Tenda and Briga one quarter of the local population moved to Italy in 1947.\n\nIn the century of nationalism between 1850 and 1950, the Nizzardi Italians were reduced from the 70% majority of the 125,000, living in the County of Nice at the time of the French annexation, to an actual minority of nearly two thousand (in the area of Tende and Menton) today.\n\nNowadays, the populations of Nice and its surroundings are fluent in French, but a few of them still speak the original Niçard language of \"Nissa La Bella\".\n\n\n\n"}

By the principle of separation of powers, a strong tradition in Canada and accepted practice, judges should respect the role of the legislature to create law. Judges are also charged to impartially apply the law as it is written.\n\nCanada has a legal system that is derived from British system of common law (and the French system in the province of Quebec). Canadian Courts have a structure that relies more heavily on the discretion of its judges, policy and common law to create a workable body of law. Thus Canada's legal system may have more potential for conflicts with regards to the accusation of judicial activism, as compared to the United States. \n\nFormer Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada Beverley McLachlin stated that:\n\nSuch accusations often arise in response to rulings involving the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Specifically, rulings that have favored the extension of gay rights, have prompted accusations of judicial activism. Justice Rosalie Abella is a particularly common target of those who perceive activism on the Supreme Court of Canada bench.\n\nThe recent judgment \"Chaoulli v Quebec\" [2005] 1 R.C.S. which declared unconstitutional the prohibition of private healthcare insurance, and challenged the principle of Canadian universal health care in Quebec was deemed by many as a prominent example of judicial activism.

{"id": "288396", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=288396", "title": "Order (business)", "text": "Order (business)\n\nIn business or commerce, an order is a stated intention, either spoken or written, to engage in a commercial transaction for specific products or services. From a buyer's point of view it expresses the intention to buy and is called a purchase order. From a seller's point of view it expresses the intention to sell and is referred to as a sales order. When the purchase order of the buyer and the sales order of the seller agree, the orders become a contract between the buyer and seller.\n\nWithin an organization, the term order may be used to refer to a work order for manufacturing, a preventive maintenance order, or an order to make repairs to a facility.\n\nIn many businesses, orders are used to collect and report costs and revenues according to well-defined purposes. Then it is possible to show for what purposes costs have been incurred.\n\nBusinesses such as retail stores, restaurants and filling stations conduct business with their customers by accepting orders that are spoken or implied by the buyer's actions. Taking a shopping cart of merchandise to a check-out counter is an implied intent to buy the merchandise. Placing a take-out or eat-in order at a restaurant is a spoken purchase order. Putting gasoline in one's tank at a filling station is an implied order. The seller usually expects immediate payment by cash, check or credit card for these purchases, and the seller provides the buyer with a receipt for the payment. In legal terms, this form of business order is an \"implied in fact contract\".\n\nIn commerce, various business documents are used to record the negotiation of an agreement to buy and sell, record the agreement itself, and record compliance with the agreement and closure of the contract. An agreement to buy and sell is a form of contract.\n\nThere are five basic requirements for a contract to exist between two parties: agreement, voluntary, consideration, capacity, and legality. A sixth requirement of \"in writing\" sometimes applies.\n\nThe main concern for commercial orders is that there must be agreement (offer and acceptance) for the order to be a contract. Prior to this, businesses often record the details of negotiations by using a request for quotation, request for bid, sales quotation, or sales bid. Quotations are non-binding and part of the negotiation process. A request for bid can be binding or non-binding, depending on the terms of the bid.\n\nOnce an agreement or contract is in place, businesses record these as confirmed purchase orders and confirmed sales orders.\n\nIn the US, Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code covers commercial contracts, and section 2-103 gives definitions of terms under this code. Section 2-106 describes the difference between a present sale (recorded as a sales order) and a sale (recorded as a transfer of title to the buyer).\n\n(1) In this Article unless the context otherwise requires \"contract\" and \"agreement\" are limited to those relating to the present or future sale of goods. \"Contract for sale\" includes both a present sale of goods and a contract to sell goods at a future time. A \"sale\" consists in the passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price (Section 2-401). A \"present sale\" means a sale which is accomplished by the making of the contract.\n\nIn their \"Advance Monthly Sales for Retail Trade and Food Services\", the US Census Bureau publishes estimates of US retail and food services sales. These \"sales\" are orders that have been filled; payment has been made or is an account receivable.\nIn their \"Preliminary Report on Manufacturers' Shipments, Inventories and Orders\", the US Census Bureau publishes statistics for \"new orders\", shipments, \"unfilled orders\" and inventories for manufactured durable goods. This gives an indication whether trade is increasing or decreasing for manufactured durable goods in the US.\n\n"}
{"id": "22237355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22237355", "title": "Payment for order flow", "text": "Payment for order flow\n\nIn financial markets payment for order flow refers to the compensation that a broker receives, not from its client, but from a third party that wants to influence how the broker routes client orders.\n\nIn general, market makers such as dealers and securities exchanges are willing to pay a broker for the right to transact with that broker's clients because they believe those clients will be uninformed traders—retail or other investors who are trading because of emotion or the need to raise cash and not because they know an asset is misvalued.\n\nBy purchasing what it expects to be uninformed order flow, a market-maker can buy at the bid and sell at the ask with less risk of trading at a loss than with an informed trader who knows that the market is mispricing the security. Thus, market-makers who pay for order flow can capture the spread while reducing the risk that the spread is too narrow to adequately compensate them for the risk of loss.\n\nPayment for order flow was a practice pioneered by Bernard Madoff, and the practice has long been controversial. However, on February 27, 2009, after years of opposing payment for order flow, the New York Stock Exchange sought permission from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow payment for order flow on its electronic exchange(s).\nThe NYSE is proposing to pay for limit orders in order to put more cash into the market. This contrasts with the traditional model of payment for order flow that pays only for market orders. \nPayment for order flow has become less lucrative on a per share basis because of the decline in the tick size and the bid/ask spread. When stocks traded on 1/8ths of a dollar, payments for order flow were much larger than they became after 2001 when the tick size in U.S. markets fell to one cent. Larry Harris reports that in 1997, 24% of E-Trade's transaction revenue came from payment for order flow, but that by the second quarter of 2001 such payments accounted for only 15% of transaction revenue.\n\nThe benign view is that in competitive markets, the payments that brokers receive for selling uninformed order flow reduce commissions for retail investors so that the retail investors are no worse off. Payment for order flow may also allow smaller trading venues to compete more effectively with the NYSE.\n\nA more negative view is that exchanges and other market-makers who pay for order flow reduce liquidity on exchanges that do not pay for order flow and thus increase the bid–ask spread. This means that traders whose orders do not receive payment bear the cost to their detriment. Joel Seligman has noted that \"Few practices are more likely to subvert quote competition\" than payment for order flow. John C. Coffee has described it as a \"bribe\". He notes, however, that the SEC permits the practice because it sustained competitors to the NYSE and reduces the likelihood that NYSE specialists will obtain monopoly power.\n\nIn the United States, accepting payment for order flow is only allowed if no other trading venue is quoting a better price on the National Market System. Moreover, the broker must inform its client in writing that it accepts payment for order flow:\n"}

It is a form of direct democracy.\n\nUnlike an initiative or legislative referendum that allows voters to suggest new legislation, a popular referendum allows them to suggest repealing existing legislation.\n\nAs with an initiative, a popular referendum is held after a given number of signatures supporting it have been submitted to the authorities; in some cases such a referendum may also be initiated by regional authorities. Depending on local legislation, the popular referendum may be implemented only in a short window of time after the legislation has been passed; in others it may be used to defeat any existing legislation. Specific details on the applicable procedure (such as the number of signatures, whether there is a time limit and its duration on when the popular referendum may be passed, and the body to which they must be submitted) vary from country to country (and in the United States, from state to state).\n\nSupporters of the popular referendum point out that it is a safeguard against special interests taking over, and protects the rights of minorities. Critics point out that direct democracy votes are dominated by people who have strong feelings about the issue at hand, and as such, it empowers special interests.\n\nIn Europe, where the popular referendum (commonly known as abrogative referendum) was first introduced in Switzerland in St. Gallen canton in 1831; it now exists in Albania, Denmark (since 1953), Italy (since 1970), Malta, Russia and Switzerland (since 1874).

Other legal proceedings have dealt with ultra vires issues (whether a jurisdiction, such as a Provincial Government or municipality, has the powers to legislate on the matter). In 2013, three provisions of the current law were overturned by the Supreme Court of Canada, with a twelve-month stay of effect. In June 2014, the Government introduced amending legislation in response.\n\nThe new formulations of section 213 found themselves under challenge in the lower courts within a year, with conflicting results \n\nNova Scotia's Appeal Court ruled the legislation violated the guarantee of freedom of expression in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, by constraining communication in relation to legal activity (R. v. Skinner (1987), 35 C.C.C. (3d) 203). The Alberta Court of Appeal disagreed, holding that infringement of freedom of expression was a justifiable limitation as no “clear and convincing” alternative was available for dealing with the nuisance of street prostitution (R. v. Jahelka (1987), 79 A.R. 44).\n\nThe Manitoba Court of Appeal upheld section 195.1(1)(c) on the grounds that there was no prima facie case of freedom of expression (Reference Re Sections 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code, [1987] 6 W.W.R. 289).\n\nWhen referred to the Supreme Court, it upheld the sections (Reference Re Sections 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1123])Chief Justice Dickson for the majority (Madam Justice Wilson and Madam Justice L'Heureux‑Dubé dissenting), agreed that freedom of expression was restricted by what was now 213(1)(c) it did not infringe or deny the freedom of association guaranteed by section 2(d) of the Charter. He also held that it did not infringe the right to be treated fairly when life, liberty and security are affected by governmental action, as guaranteed by section 7 of the Charter. The reference to the court also included the bawdy house provisions which were held to not infringe the guarantee of freedom of expression provided for by section 2(b) of the Charter. Finally the impugned infringement of the freedom of expression guaranteed by section 2(b) of the Charter was justifiable under section 1 of the Charter as being a reasonable limit on a protected right.\n\nThe justification was set out in three stages:\n\nA part of section 198(1)(d) was challenged in 1991, namely that a previous conviction of keeping a disorderly house amounts to proof of the nature of the premises in subsequent proceedings. This was held to contravene sections 11(d) and 7 of the Charter (R. v. Janoff (1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 454 (Que. C.A.)), and became inoperative.\n\nA legal challenge to three of Canada's many prostitution laws was filed in Ontario Superior Court in March 2007.\nIn a decision handed down by Madam Justice Susan Himel in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice on September 28, 2010, the prostitution laws were declared invalid.\n\nThe Government announced it would appeal this decision on April 25, and on October 25, 2012, the Supreme Court of Canada agreed to hear the appeal. The Supreme Court also agreed to hear a cross-appeal by sex-trade workers on the Court of Appeal for Ontario's decision to ban solicitation. The Supreme Court of Canada heard the case on June 13, 2013.\n\nA related challenge was mounted in British Columbia in 2007\n\n, but did not proceed due to a procedural motion by the Attorney General of Canada seeking dismissal on the grounds of lack of standing by the litigants. This was upheld by the BC Supreme Court in 2008, \nbut successfully appealed in October 2010. \nThe Attorney General then appealed this decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada who released their decision on September 21, 2012. They dismissed the appeal enabling the case to once again proceed in the court of first instance.\nThe Supreme Court made a number of observations regarding the issues involved:\n\"In this case, all three factors, applied purposively and flexibly, favour granting public interest standing to the respondents. In fact, there is no dispute that the first and second factors are met: the respondents’ action raises serious justiciable issues and the respondents have an interest in the outcome of the action and are fully engaged with the issues that they seek to raise. Indeed, the constitutionality of the prostitution provisions of the Criminal Code constitutes a serious justiciable issue and the respondents, given their work, have a strong engagement with the issue...\n\n\"This case constitutes public interest litigation: the respondents have raised issues of public importance that transcend their immediate interests. Their challenge is comprehensive, relating as it does to nearly the entire legislative scheme. It provides an opportunity to assess through the constitutional lens the overall effect of this scheme on those most directly affected by it...\nIt is obvious that the claim is being pursued with thoroughness and skill...\"\n\n\"The impugned Criminal Code provisions, by criminalizing many of the activities surrounding prostitution, adversely affect a great number of women. These issues are also clearly justiciable ones, as they concern the constitutionality of the challenged provisions...\n\"Some aspects of the statement of claim raise serious issues as to the invalidity of the legislation...\"\n\n\"Granting standing will not only serve to enhance the principle of legality with respect to serious issues of direct concern to some of the most marginalized members of society, but it will also promote the economical use of scarce judicial resources\"\"\n\nIn view of the subsequent decision by the Supreme Court of Canada, this application became moot.\n\nIn a decision dated 20 December 2013, the Supreme Court of Canada struck down the laws in question, ruling that a ban on solicitation and brothels violated prostitutes' rights to safety. They delayed the enforcement of their decision for one year—also applicable to the Ontario sections—to give the government a chance to write new laws. Following the announcement of the decision Valerie Scott, one of the applicants, stated in the media that, regardless of the decision, sex workers must be involved in the process of constructing the new legislation: \"The thing here is politicians, though they may know us as clients, they do not understand how sex work works. They won't be able to write a half-decent law. It will fail. That's why you must bring sex workers to the table in a meaningful way.\"\n\nIn response, Peter MacKay the Minister of Justice introduced amending legislation, C-36 the \"Protection of Communities and Exploited Persons Act\" (PCEPA) on June 4, 2014, which received first reading. Debate on second reading began on June 11. It passed the third reading on October 6 and was approved by the Senate on November 4. On November 6, 2014, Bill C-36 received Royal Assent and officially became law.\n\nThe wording of section 197 allows of some interpretation. As noted by the Supreme Court of Canada in Cohen [1939] \"Prior to 1907, a common bawdy house was defined by section 225 of the Code as “a house, room, set of rooms or place of any kind kept for purposes of prostitution,” but in that year, by 6-7 Edward VII, chapter 8, section 2, the section was repealed and a new one enacted in the same terms but with the addition at the end, of the words “or occupied or resorted to by one or more persons for such purposes.” That case reversed an Ontario Court of Appeal decision acquitting a woman convicted of offering sexual services on her own. The court pointed to the words \"one or more persons\" as clearly indicating that operating on one's own constituted a bawdy house. \nAnother requisite is that a place must be resorted to for prostitution on a habitual and regular basis (R. v. Patterson (1968), 67 D.L.R. (2d) 82 (S.C.C.)). A woman who used her own apartment, alone, but regularly was convicted (R. v. Worthington (1972), 22 C.R.N.S. 34 (Ont. C.A.)).\n\nAnother relates to the alternative definition of \"the practice of acts of indecency\", since this leaves open the definition of indecency, which may not be universally understood or accepted. One definition of community standards comes from the Supreme Court decision in R. v. Tremblay, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 932. In considering nude dancing the majority held that the acts were not indecent since they did not fall below the community standard of tolerance, citing the circumstances surrounding the act, the degree of harm that could result from public exposure, and expert evidence. No complaints had been received; the acts were in a closed room between consenting adults without physical contact, while expert witnesses suggested this was voyeurism and exhibitionism that caused no harm.\n\nWhen \"Tremblay\" was used in Ontario to determine that lap dancing or table dancing was not indecent Toronto passed a by-law prohibiting close-contact dancing. However the Court of Appeal reversed the decision on the grounds that this constituted prostitution (R. v. Mara, 27 O.R. (3d) 643). Furthermore, the court ruled that Parliament intended to abolish prostitution as a form of violence against women, and thus the dancing exceeded public acceptability. The Supreme Court confirmed this in June 1997 holding that sexual contact constitutes prostitution and exceeds community standards.\n\n\"This type of activity is harmful to society in many ways. It degrades and dehumanizes women; it desensitizes sexuality and is incompatible with the dignity and equality of each human being\". Mr. Justice Sopinka, 26 June 1997 \n\nParticipation alone is insufficient under 210 (1), without “some degree of control over the care and management of the premises” (R. v. Corbeil, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 83).\nSubsection 3 provides a presumption of offence of living on the avails, if associated with a sex worker or premise. A reverse onus such as this contravenes the presumption of evidence under section 11(d) of the Charter and was challenged. The Supreme Court found this justifiable in Downey v. R.( [1992] 2 S.C.R. 10). The majority accepted that an accused might be convicted despite the existence of reasonable doubt, for instance, a person may share accommodation with someone without necessarily living on their earnings. The Court found this a reasonable limit on the presumption of innocence because the intent was to prevent exploitation by pimps and that there was no real danger of innocent persons being found guilty if they provided evidence to the contrary, thereby constituting reasonable doubt. It was felt that this provision protected sex workers from abuse.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "34781030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34781030", "title": "Protecting Children from Internet Predators Act", "text": "Protecting Children from Internet Predators Act\n\nThe Protecting Children from Internet Predators Act (officially titled Bill C-30, originally titled Lawful Access Act) was a proposed amendment to the Criminal Code introduced by the Conservative government of Stephen Harper on February 14, 2012, during the 41st Canadian Parliament.\n\nThe bill would have granted authorities new powers to monitor and track the digital activities of Canadians in real-time, required service providers to log information about their customers and turn it over if requested, and made back door entrances mandatory allowing remote access of individuals' electronic information, each without needing a warrant Documents obtained under the \"Access to Information Act\" show that the government desired to use the expanded powers in cases not involving criminality.\n\nThe bill did not mention children, or internet predators, other than in its title; critics claimed the \"feel-good name\" was unrelated to the content of the bill, and chosen simply to \"sell legislation to the public\". Critics claimed that authorities would likely use the powers to harass peaceful protestors and activists.\n\nThe bill was widely opposed within Canada, particularly after Public Safety Minister Vic Toews told an opposition MP that he could \"either stand with us or with the child pornographers\" during a debate. The government ultimately withdrew the bill in 2013, citing that opposition. Similar legislation had been unsuccessfully proposed in the past, by both the Liberal and Conservative parties in Canada, and mirrored legislation introduced in other countries. This bill, however, was re-introduced under the name Bill C-13 (short titled Protecting Canadians from Online Crime Act) by Stephen Harper's Conservative government on November 20, 2013 and it passed through all legislative stages to receive royal assent on December 9, 2014.\n\nThere had been multiple attempts to introduce \"lawful access\" legislation, allowing police to avoid the necessity of a warrant to obtain information, since 1999 when the Liberal Party of Canada first proposed it. However none of them have been successfully passed. Bill C-30 largely mirrored the unsuccessful attempts by the Conservatives to table C-50, C-51 and C-52 that were abandoned upon the dissolution of Parliament for the 2011 federal election. NDP MPs Anne Minh-Thu Quach and Carol Hughes have criticised the Liberal party given their previous support for near-identical legislation in the past.\n\nThe British Columbia Civil Liberties Association and \"Canadian Lawyer\" magazine have suggested that such proposals may violate the Constitution of Canada, and be challenged before the Supreme Court as unreasonable search and seizure of digital information.\n\nIn 2007, Toews' predecessor Stockwell Day stated that \"we have not and we will not be proposing legislation to grant police the powers to get information from internet providers without a warrant\". Toews has dismissed the comment, and noted that the requirement for court oversight of police was \"an additional burden on the criminal justice system.\"\n\nOn February 14, 2012 Toews formally tabled the \"Bill C-30: Lawful Access Act\", but withdrew the bill an hour later and resubmit it with a \"last minute change\", the title \"Bill C-30: Protecting Children from Internet Predators Act\" instead.\n\nThe bill would have allowed authorities to demand access to subscriber information from both ISPs and telephone providers without needing to present a warrant - and would have required telecommunications providers to ensure that there was a back door entrance to allow all communications to be intercepted when desired.\n\nThe bill would not only have granted these powers to police agencies, but also to the Canadian Security Intelligence Service and Competition Bureau officials, as well as anybody \"appointed\" by the Minister of Public Safety to carry out such actions. The bill would also have allowed any of these persons to make copies of the data taken from citizens' digital devices, without oversight or a right of appeal.\n\nThe bill would have prohibited ISPs from answering affirmatively if a customer asked them whether authorities had been searching their data.\n\nThe bill would have increased the number of actions that can be legally carried out by police officers without a warrant. In the current Criminal Code, section 487.11 allows a police officer to \"exercise any of the powers described in subsection 487(1) or 492.1(1) without a warrant\". In Bill C-30, the section was amended to include \"exercise any of the powers described in section 487, 492.1 or 492.2 without a warrant\".\n\nSection 487 of the Criminal Code was left unchanged by Bill C-30; ts subsection 487(2.1) allows a police officer to search a building and \"use any computer system at the building or place to search any data contained in or available to the computer system\", among other things. Section 492.1 was to be slightly amended by Bill C-30 to allow a police officer to obtain location tracking data by means of a tracking device and \"install, activate, use, maintain, monitor and remove the tracking device, including covertly\". Section 492.2 was also to be amended by Bill C-30 to allow a police officer to obtain transmission data by means of a transmission data recorder and \"install, activate, use, maintain, monitor and remove the transmission data recorder, including covertly\".\n\nIn Bill C-30, tracking data was defined as \"data that relates to the location of a transaction, individual or thing\". Transmission data has a more complicated definition, but essentially refers to meta-data that is attached to a message/communication in order to aid in its transmission to its intended destination, such as IP address, phone number, time, duration, size.\n\nSection 64 of the bill was a final \"catch-all\" that says that if the government decided it overlooked any additional abilities it believed it needed to fulfill \"generally, for carrying out the purposes and provisions of this act\", it could have retroactively add those abilities to the law.\n\nAlthough Stephen Harper led a majority government, all four minority parties, the NDP, Liberals, Bloc Québécois, and Green Party were opposed to the lawful access provisions of C-30. In addition, John Williamson (New Brunswick Southwest), David Tilson (Dufferin—Caledon) and Rob Anders (Calgary West) were among the Conservative MPs who opposed the bill. Political criticism from the Liberals, NDP and Greens has suggested it was hypocritical for the Conservatives to introduce the bill, after scrapping both the long-form census and gun registry in the name of privacy.\n\nThe bill was supported by many Canadian police agencies. Supporters of the bill have stated that all Canada's attorneys-general also support the bill, while critics have challenged that as untrue.\n\nA coalition of citizens and civil liberties organizations formed the StopSpying.ca coalition in June 2011 to speak out against lawful access. The coalition was led by OpenMedia.ca and considered responsible for leading the public outcry against bill c-30. \nWithout commenting on the morality of the bill, the Canadian Network Operators Consortium noted that smaller, independent ISPs would likely be unable to afford expensive new equipment to allow authorities real-time monitoring of their customers and may have to discontinue business. The Ministry had estimated that the initial cost of the bill to be $80 Million over four years, and $6.7 Million dollars each year after that. The ISPs claimed the cost could be much higher. According to the CBC, the costs would have either translated as higher telecommunications costs for Canadian consumers, or increased federal taxes to pay for the program.\n\nGreen Party leader Elizabeth May dubbed the title propaganda, noting that \"other than the fact it’s for propaganda purposes, there’s no reason to call it about Internet predators\", suggesting that the Conservatives were trying to use the rhetorical ploy of appealing to the sake of children to garner support. The Province suggested a more accurate name might be the \"Spying on Every Single Canadian any Time We Feel Like it Act\".\n\nOpposition had focused on the provisions that would allow law enforcement agencies and government-appointed inspectors to access identifying information from ISPs on demand, without a warrant. Documents leaked online showed the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police asking members to find examples of cases that would have profited from lawful access, but no cases had been found, leading critics to charge that police were already able to prosecute predators successfully in Canada with existing legislation.\n\nThe international advocacy group Reporters Without Borders opined the bill went too far, and failed to account for \"respect for people’s private lives and the presumption of innocence\". Federal deputy privacy commissioner Chantal Bernier argued the proposed powers are too broad: \"As the legislation is written now, it could impact any law-abiding Canadian citizen.\"\n\nMedia outlets had largely panned the bill's proposals; the National Post derided the bill as \"an electronic prisoner's bracelet on every Canadian\", columnist Ivor Tossell of The Globe and Mail said it presented \"real dangers\", and the Toronto Star argued that it was the \"most grotesque intrusion into our lives\".\n\nThe University of Ottawa's Michael Geist said the legislation intended to build \"an extensive online surveillance infrastructure\". Meanwhile, Ann Cavoukian, the Ontario Privacy Commissioner warned that the collected information would be a \"gold mine\" for potential hackers. All of the nation's privacy commissioners issued a joint statement condemning the bill. Liberal MP Sean Casey satirically asked Toews and Nicholson to openly divulge their own web surfing histories.\n\nSurveys conducted in February 2012 showed that between 53 and 66% of Canadians opposed the bill being passed.\n\nGovernment officials claimed that similar legislation has been introduced in several other countries already, including the United States, Great Britain and Australia. However, critics have said that other countries should serve as a warning to Canada, noting the many errors and broad overreach of their legislation, with police requesting the private information for mundane tasks such as determining school district eligibility.\n\nSimilar legislation has been drafted in the Philippines despite being met with up to eight petitions filed with the highest court in the Philippines questioning the constitutionality of the legislation. The Filipino legislation is intended, like the Canadian bill, to prevent cybersex, online child pornography, identity theft, and spamming. However, in addition to these crimes, the Filipino bill also makes libel a cybercrime punishable by up to twelve years. It is generally this last issue that has privacy and right’s groups concerned over the legislation. “It violates Filipinos' rights to free expression and it is wholly incompatible with the Philippine government's obligations under international law,” said Brad Adams, Asia director of US-based Human Rights Watch.\n\nIn Australia, Cybercrime Legislation Amendment Bill 2011 allows telecommunications companies to retain customer traffic data for longer if a customer is suspected in a cybercrime, unlike the proposed Canadian legislation however, this information cannot be handed over to police without a warrant. Like the Canadian bill, the Australian version was met with heavy criticism and a report from the Joint Select Committee on Cyber-Safety of Australia took issue with four main flaws in the Australian legislation and made 13 recommendations, which Attorney-General Robert McClelland said the government will “consider”. \nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation highlighted the fact that the warrantless British system has resulted in police making an average of more than 1,700 queries daily, for personal information about citizens from their telecommunications providers.;\n\nIn the United States the FISA act (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) along with the amendments made to it in 2008 can be considered a similar bill to that of the Canadian bill C-30. The FISA protects telecommunications companies complicit in providing user information to federal law enforcement authorities. In addition to this the 2008 amendments, which were extended another five years at the end of 2012, allow the NSA (National Security Agency) to conduct electronic surveillance on any US citizen suspected of conversing with any person outside of the USA suspected by the US government of terrorist activities. No warrant is needed for the execution of surveillance over American citizens, which is the central issue privacy and rights’ activists have had with this legislation.\n\nPublic safety minister Vic Toews, who introduced the bill, had become a lightning rod for criticism after suggesting people had to choose to \"either stand with us or with the child pornographers\", a remark that was said to be \"so far out whack with the standards of polite discourse that it kind of scared [supporters] off\". NDP MP Jasbir Sandhu commented that \"We are often warned that rights and freedoms are not permanent, that we only keep them if we stand up and fight for them. However, when [we] stand up and fight to protect these rights[...], we are accused of being sympathetic to child pornographers\".\n\nToews drew additional criticism after admitting that he had not entirely read the legislation that he put forward. NDP MP Charlie Angus went so far as to ask \"How can Canadians trust a minister who cannot even read his own legislation?\".\n\nAs a consequence, Toews had become a target of social media protests against the bill, including a Twitter campaign to inform him of Canadians' everyday mundane activities in an ironic bid to highlight their perceived loss of privacy if the bill should pass. Another Twitter user retrieved a copy of Toews' 2008 divorce particulars from the local Winnipeg courthouse and began spreading the contained information, as well as his spending habits, over the internet as retaliation to highlight the lack of privacy Toews' bill would afford Canadians. It was revealed that the IP address associated with the account originated within the House of Commons. Minister of Foreign Affairs John Baird suggested the account was a creation of the NDP playing a \"dirty, sleazy, Internet game\". and the account was quickly shut down, although later determined to belong to a Liberal staffer named Adam Carroll.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police stated that Toews had referred them to online threats, and that they were \"pondering\" an investigation, after the Anonymous hacker collective stated that it would be launching \"Operation White North\", and threatened to reveal further details from Toews' private life if the bill were not withdrawn, noting they \"will not allow a politician who allows his citizens no secrets to have any secrets of his own.\" Anonymous released the name of Vic Toews' mistress in a release on YouTube. Bill C-30 was also one of the targets of the new initiative by Anonymous called \"Operation Kill Billz\" \n\nAs a result of the opposition to the bill, the government referred it back to the House Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights for possible amendment before introducing it for Second Reading. The bill was quietly shelved during the summer of 2012. Citing public opposition, the government announced in February 2013 that the legislation had been withdrawn. Nicholson stated that the government had \"listened to the concerns of Canadians who have been very clear on this and responding to that\". He added, “We will not be proceeding with Bill C-30. And any attempts to modernize the criminal code will not contain …warrantless mandatory disclosure of basic subscriber information or the requirement for telecommunications service providers to build intercept capability within their systems.” Bill C-55, which was originally part of the original Internet surveillance legislation, is all that remains of the contentious Bill C-30. Bill C-55 is needed to bring Canada’s emergency wiretapping powers into conformity with a 2012 Supreme Court decision that struck down a 20-year-old law on the grounds that it did not require police to inform those who had been wiretapped after the fact or provide for any other oversight of the police power. Thus on account of this bill, any persons subject to government surveillance or wiretapping in Canada must legally be informed of the surveillance after the fact.\n"}
{"id": "38790938", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38790938", "title": "Prudential capital controls", "text": "Prudential capital controls\n\nPrudential capital controls are typical ways of prudential regulation that takes the form of capital controls and regulates a country’s capital account inflows. Prudential capital controls aim to mitigate systemic risk, reduce business cycle volatility, increase macroeconomic stability, and enhance social welfare.\n\nThe term “prudential” distinguishes such typical capital control measures from other general capital controls by emphasizing both the motive of “prudence” and the ex-ante timing. Firstly, the prudence motivation requirement says that such regulation should curb and manage the excessive risk accumulation process with cautious forethoughts for the purpose of preventing an emerging financial crisis and economic collapse. Secondly, the ex-ante timing means that such regulation should be taken effectively before the realization of any unfettered crisis as opposed to taking policy interventions after a severe crisis already hits the economy. In addition, prudential capital controls only apply to capital inflows because the excessive risk accumulation process that intrinsically creates the domestic financial vulnerability is usually associated with capital inflow rather than outflow. Neely (1999) summarized some other nonprudential ways of exercising capital controls. For example, restrictions on the volume and price for domestic currency and financial asset transactions, requirements for administrative approval of capital outflow, or limits on the amount of money that a citizen is allowed to take out of the country.\n\nThe history of capital free flows and controls unfolds with the history of financial globalization. At the onset, capital moved freely across borders during the Gold Standard period before World War I. After World War II, owing to the suspicion that a country’s macroeconomic instability could be due to the volatile capital flows, capital flows were deliberately managed under a variety of administrative controls as part of the governance in the international monetary Bretton Woods system.\n\nStarting from early 1970s, increasingly relaxed capital controls along with the adoptions of floating exchange rate regime worldwide, though in the midst of concerns, announced the collapse of the Bretton Woods. Roughly from 1990s to 2009 known as the Washington Consensus period, it was widely accepted that the economic prosperity in the emerging market economies was attributed to the liberalization of their capital accounts and the increasing capital inflow. Then the policy prescriptions for these countries were that capital controls should be loosened and eventually abandoned.\n\nThe pro-capital flow arguments were not reviewed and critiqued until the Great Recession in the late 2000s. Emerging markets experienced strong capital inflows in the boom stage of a business cycle whereas they witnessed huge flow reverse and financial collapse in the bust period. This boom and bust cycles in international capital flows imposed significant welfare costs. Then the theoretical underpinnings of the Great Recession crisis mechanism give a role for the prudential capital controls as an intervention to adjust the market imperfections in order to mitigate the systemic boom-bust cycle effects brought by the international capital flows\n\nTo justify the necessity of the external regulation, market imperfections of a free market economy must be identified as socially inefficient and adjustable in the sense of pareto improving. Three different theoretical paradigms can be used to illustrate the market imperfections and to introduce the role of prudential regulations: 1. The Agency Paradigm; 2. The Mood Swing Paradigm. 3. The Externality Paradigm. The Prudential Capital Controls, as a particular form of prudential regulations, builds its theory foundation heavily on the paradigm of externalities.\n\nThe Agency paradigm highlights various forms of principal-agent problems. An example is a moral hazard problem: considered as lender of last resort and provider of deposit insurance, government induces the under-regulated banks to take excessive risks which creates the financial vulnerability. The moral hazard problem occurs in both the individual level and in a collective fashion, which justifies the prudential regulations.\n\nIn the Mood Swing paradigm, investors’ and consumers’ animal spirit induces an overly optimistic mood in good times of tracing the mispriced asset price signals, which accumulates excessive risk that runs down the financial system and the economy when there is a bad shock. Then ex-ante macroprudential regulations can play a role to manage overall mood and alert the risks.\n\nBased on the Externality Paradigm, prudential capital controls, as one of the prudential regulations, are called to deal with the typical market imperfection known as the pecuniary externality in an open economy in order to curb the destabilizing effects of capital flows on domestic financial market.\n\nThe key market imperfection, the pecuniary externality, is defined as a particular form of externality that a private agent's optimal decision affects the welfare of another agent through prices. Other market distortions, such as the incomplete markets in which private agents cannot fully insure their idiosyncratic risks, the information asymmetry and limited commitment by which lenders do not know whether or not the borrowers will default and thus have collateral requirements on the borrowers, could aggravate the role of pecuniary externality. When applied to the open economy context with incomplete markets that involves external borrowing and collateral constraint, the pecuniary externality can be used to explain the stylized fact of an open economy’s excessive borrowing from outside the country as seen by overly large amount of capital inflow: small, rational and individual domestic private agents take as given the exchange rates and asset prices that determine the external borrowing limit, but they do not internalize the price effects of their individual actions that their joint behavior could determine the level of exchange rates and asset prices and hence the degree of financial fragility in the economy. In other words, private agents take too much risk. Then their aggregate borrowing exceeds the socially efficient level so that the risk of a financial systemic collapse is created and it could potentially lead to a financial crisis and economic downturn.\n\nSuch a problem of excessive borrowing rooted on the pecuniary externality and market incompleteness can be much more severe when some financial amplification mechanism is present: For example, some negative shocks on the aggregate demand could lead to the real depreciation and the fall of domestic asset prices, which brings about the incipient adverse balance sheet effects that decrease the firm net worth and value of collateral. Consequently, the shrink of collateral value further constrains the private agents’ accesses to external borrowing through the binding borrowing constraint, which in turn results in the economy-wise spending cut and initial aggregate demand contraction is thus amplified. As shown in the graph depicting such a loop of effects, it is even striking that adverse shock on any step of this feedback loop could trigger this amplification of initial negative effects. Hence the overly large inflow of capital would potentially create a systemic risk and activate the amplification mechanism, which ultimately would generate large business cycle volatility, sudden collapse of the financial system and the economic recessions only given such a small incipient adverse shock on the feedback loop.\n\nTo curb the amplification mechanism, mitigating the pecuniary externality that results in the excessive risk-taking and excessive capital inflow for an open economy is the key, As proved by Greenwald and Stiglitz (1986), in the presence of pecuniary externality and market incompleteness, some policy intervention that aims to reduce the pecuniary externality problem could achieve larger social benefits while incur only small social cost. This justifies the role for external intervention. In the case of excessive external borrowing problem in the open economy, the prudential capital controls are the desired regulations that kick in to induce private agents to internalize the externality and to reduce the excessive risk-taking exposures.\n\nClassic textbook policy recommendation that deals with externalities includes variations of Pigouvian Tax.\n\nPigouvian type of taxation can be introduced to induce private agents to internalize their contributions to the systemic risk so as to improve the social welfare with only small magnitude of social cost incurred. In reality, the appropriate intervention does not have to be in the form of taxation. Restricting certain types of capital inflow or creating market to trade permits of liability issuance could be other forms of implementable policies. However, all the policies in a reduced form amount to take some effective Pigouvian Taxation to optimally control the capital inflow. It is argued that a straightforward tax on capital inflows is the best form of capital controls.\n\nThe prudential capital controls should differentiate the types of capital inflow based on their contributions to the systemic risk. Since different forms of capital inflow would result in different probabilities of future capital outflows with different payoff characteristics in the event of a crisis, thus they lead to different degrees of negative externality. In the case of an emerging market economy, Korinek (2010) found that dollar debt imposes a larger negative externality, followed by CPI-indexed debt that hedges against the exchange rate risk as dollar debt suffers, local currency debt and portfolio investment. The non-financial foreign direct investment often stays in the country when a financial crisis occurs so that it has no externalities. In other words, the pigouvian tax should be set equal to the magnitude of the externalities of different inflow types. Based on Korinek’s (2010) estimated the optimal annual magnitude of externalities for various types of capital inflows for Indonesia. As the graph shows, the magnitude of externalities confirms the indicated order of magnitude for different types. Long run average indicates an average magnitude of externalities for the past 20 years. And red bars capture the magnitude during the 1997-1998 Asian Crisis. It is clear that externalities of foreign capital inflow rise during booms and leverages were built up. After a crisis, the externalities are smaller once the economy was de-leveraged. Therefore, the magnitude of optimal tax should be time-variant which depends on the financial vulnerability over business cycles. The optimal tax rates should be tighter during the boom and lowered even to zero during the bust.\n\nDuring roughly the period of the first quarter in 2000 to the second quarter in 2008, Peru took some conventional controls on capital inflow and outflows along with prudential capital control measures as listed below:\nAs a result, these measures helped ease the appreciation pressures, significantly reduced net inflows, slowed credit expansion and lengthened the maturity of capital inflows. However, it was recognized that Peru was one of the very few cases that prudential capital control measures were indeed effective. Other countries who ever took the prudential measures on capital controls are Croatia, Korea, Romania, Colombia, Thailand and Philippines etc.\n\nIt could be extremely hard to identify the “true” causal links between the prudential capital controls and the economic stability, financial development and economic growth with the conventional econometric tools. Therefore, the empirical evidences can be hard to directly infer on the effectiveness of prudential capital controls not to mention the mixed findings themselves. For example, if the reduced volatility could be explained by prudential inflow measures, then the reversed causality can be still valid since the more developed domestic capital markets with smaller fluctuations could also temper foreign investors’ incentive to inject capital inflow due to smaller interest differential. A few key findings to shed lights on the effectiveness of the prudential capital controls measures are listed below. Some are unambiguously positive, some mixed and some contingent on covariates:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10918059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10918059", "title": "Pujo Committee", "text": "Pujo Committee\n\nThe Pujo Committee was a United States congressional subcommittee in 1912–1913 that was formed to investigate the so-called \"money trust\", a community of Wall Street bankers and financiers that exerted powerful control over the nation's finances. After a resolution introduced by congressman Charles Lindbergh Sr. for a probe on Wall Street power, congressman Arsène Pujo of Louisiana was authorized to form a subcommittee of the House Committee on Banking and Currency. In 1913–1914, the findings inspired public support for ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment that authorized a federal income tax, passage of the Federal Reserve Act, and passage of the Clayton Antitrust Act.\n\nBeginning in the late 1800s, a concern regarding the power of bankers and monopolies began to grow. This led to a breaking point in July 1911, when Congressman Charles August Lindbergh asserted that a banking trust existed within the United States and that it should be investigated. A move to create an investigation was then made on February 7, 1912, when the democratic Money Trust Caucus decided to pass House Resolution 405. Not long after this resolution's passage, amendments followed placing the investigation of the Money Trusts into the hands of then-chairman of the Banking and Currency Committee, Arsène Paulin Pujo of Louisiana. Pujo submitted a resolution, later amended and passed by a vote of 268-8, to establish the footing upon which the rest of the investigation would base itself.\n\nAs early as December 12, 1911, the lawyer Samuel Untermyer supported the creation of such an investigation, encouraging Lindbergh to continue fighting for its creation despite early setbacks. Untermyer, a strong proponent of the investigation himself, eventually came to be the committee's counsel. Despite being called the Pujo Committee, in March 1912, approximately a month after it received authorization, Pujo's wife became ill, forcing him to take an indefinite leave of absence from the investigation. His successor was Representative Hubert D. Stephens of Mississippi.\n\nThe investigation originally intended to examine data from 1905–1912 regarding all loans of $1,000,000 or greater; however, the Comptroller of the Currency furnished only a fraction of the overall data, hampering the investigation's scope. Three sections of the economy were the focus of attention: clearing houses, the New York Stock Exchange, and the growing concentration of wealth within the economy. Witnesses were first examined on May 16, 1912.\n\nThe Committee concluded that clearing house associations (associations created for the clearing of checks to and from individual banks) based in New York were gaining power at the public's expense. This was done via minimum capital requirements as well as predatory membership and discriminatory member policies. The report states, \"Non-member banks must engage a member bank as its clearing agent, which in effect leaves its future up to the discretion a single bank.\" This clause allowed member banks and the boards of these clearing houses to stifle any competition that might arise from smaller upstart banks by simply telling their member banks not to act as their clearing agents. In fact, the Panic of 1907 started with the closing of the Knickerbocker Trust Co., when its member clearing bank (the National Bank of Commerce of New York) refused to act as its clearing agent anymore.\n\nThe Committee discovered that, much like the clearing houses, certain predatory listing practices were forcing certain restrictions on both members and non-members of its exchange. Additionally, the Committee discovered large amounts of \"unwholesome speculation\" and price manipulation, citing examples of large groups colluding for profit and ultimately running companies out of business.\n\nThe Committee discovered several forces, such as the consolidation of banks and interlocking directorates (small groups of the same men serving as directors on several different boards) had led to increased wealth accumulation of 42.9% of America's total banking resources held by its twenty largest banks. Furthermore, with much surprise to the investigators, it was found that \"180 individuals\" covering \"341 directorships in 112 corporations...[possessed] $22,245,000,000 in aggregate resources of capitalization.\" Finally, it was concluded that a system known counterintuitively as \"Banking Ethics\" prohibited competition among banks and firms.\n\nDespite the fact that lead attorney Samuel Untermyer had predetermined that no money trust would be found as part of the Investigation because “There is no agreement existing among these men that is in violation of the law”, and despite the refusal of aid by the Comptroller of the Currency, the failure of the Senate to pass the bill to amend section 5241 of the Revised Statutes, and the lack of any authoritative decision by the courts sustaining the committee's right to access the books of the national banks, the Pujo Committee Report concluded in 1913 that a community of influential financial leaders had gained control of major manufacturing, transportation, mining, telecommunications and financial markets of the United States. The report revealed that at least eighteen different major financial corporations were under the control of a cartel led by J.P. Morgan, George F. Baker and James Stillman. These three men, through the resources of seven banks and trust companies (Banker’s Trust Co., Guaranty Trust Co., Astor Trust Co., National Bank of Commerce, Liberty National Bank, Chase National Bank, Farmer’s Loan and Trust Co.) controlled an estimated $2.1 billion. The report revealed that a handful of men held manipulative control of the New York Stock Exchange and attempted to evade interstate trade laws.\n\nThe Pujo Report singled out individual bankers including Paul Warburg, Jacob H. Schiff, Felix M. Warburg, Frank E. Peabody, William Rockefeller and Benjamin Strong, Jr.. The report identified over $22 billion in resources and capitalization controlled through 341 directorships held in 112 corporations by members of the empire headed by J.P. Morgan.\n\nAlthough Pujo left Congress in 1913, the findings of the committee inspired public support for ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment in 1913 that authorized a federal income tax, passage of the Federal Reserve Act that same year, and passage of the Clayton Antitrust Act in 1914. The findings were also widely publicized in the Louis Brandeis book, \"Others People's Money—and How the Bankers Use It\".\n\nHouse of Morgan partners blamed the April 1913 death of J.P. Morgan on the stress of testifying in the Pujo hearings, though other health factors were certainly involved.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "340782", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=340782", "title": "Pykrete", "text": "Pykrete\n\nPykrete is a frozen composite material, originally made of approximately 14 percent sawdust or some other form of wood pulp (such as paper) and 86 percent ice by weight (6 to 1 by weight). During World War II, Geoffrey Pyke proposed it as a candidate material for a supersized aircraft carrier for the British Royal Navy. Pykrete features unusual properties, including a relatively slow melting rate due to its low thermal conductivity, as well as a vastly improved strength and toughness compared to ordinary ice. These physical properties can make the material comparable to concrete, as long as the material is kept frozen.\n\nPykrete is slightly more difficult to form than concrete, as it expands during the freezing process. However, it can be repaired and maintained using seawater as a raw material. The mixture can be moulded into any shape and frozen, and it will be tough and durable, as long as it is kept at or below freezing temperature. Resistance to gradual creep or sagging is improved by lowering the temperature further, to \n\nGeoffrey Pyke managed to convince Lord Mountbatten of the potential of his proposal (actually prior to the invention of pykrete) some time around 1942, and trials were made at two locations in Alberta, Canada. The idea for a ship made of ice impressed the United States and Canada enough that a -long, 1,000-ton ship was built in one month on Patricia Lake in the Canadian Rockies. However, it was constructed using plain ice (from the lake), before pykrete was proposed. It took slightly more than an entire summer to melt, but plain ice proved to be too weak. Pyke learned from a report by Herman Mark and his assistant that ice made from water mixed with wood fibres formed a strong solid mass—much stronger than pure water ice. Max Perutz later recalled:\n\nPerutz would later learn that Project Habakkuk was the plan to build an enormous aircraft carrier, actually more of a floating island than a ship in the traditional sense. The experiments of Perutz and his collaborators in Smithfield Meat Market in the City of London took place in great secrecy behind a screen of animal carcasses. The tests confirmed that pykrete is much stronger than pure ice and does not shatter, but also that it sags under its own weight at temperatures higher than .\n\nMountbatten’s reaction to the breakthrough is recorded by Pyke's biographer David Lampe:\nAnother tale is that at the Quebec Conference of 1943 Mountbatten brought a block of pykrete along to demonstrate its potential to the entourage of admirals and generals who had come along with Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Mountbatten entered the project meeting with two blocks and placed them on the ground. One was a normal ice block and the other was pykrete. He then drew his service pistol and shot at the first block. It shattered and splintered. Next, he fired at the pykrete to give an idea of the resistance of that kind of ice to projectiles. The bullet ricocheted off the block, grazing the trouser leg of Admiral Ernest King and ending up in the wall. According to Perutz's own account, however, the incident of a ricochetting bullet hitting an Admiral actually happened much earlier in London and the gun was fired by someone on the project—not Mountbatten.\n\nDespite these tests, the main Project Habakkuk was never put into action because of limitations in funds and the belief that the tides of the war were beginning to turn in favour of the Allies using more conventional methods.\n\nAccording to the memoirs of British General Ismay:\n\nSince World War II, pykrete has remained a scientific curiosity, unexploited by research or construction of any significance. New concepts for pykrete however crop up occasionally among architects, engineers and futurists, usually regarding its potential for mammoth offshore construction or its improvement by applying super-strong materials such as synthetic composites or Kevlar.\n\nIn 1985, pykrete was considered for a quay in Oslo harbour. However, the idea was later shelved, considering pykrete's unreliability in the real-world environment. Since pykrete needs to be preserved at or below freezing point, and tends to sag under its own weight at temperatures above , an alternative was considered that would guarantee effectiveness and public safety.\n\nIn 2011, the Vienna University of Technology successfully built a pykrete ice dome, measuring in diameter. They improved on an original Japanese technique of spraying ice on a balloon by using the natural properties of ice and its strength. This structure managed to stand for three months before solar radiation started melting the ice, rendering the structure unreliable. Researcher Johann Kollegger of Vienna University of Technology thinks his team's alternative new method is easier, avoiding icy sprayback onto the workers. To build their freestanding structure, Kollegger and his colleagues first cut an plate of ice into 16 segments. To sculpt the segments to have a dome-like curve, the researchers relied on ice's creep behavior. If pressure is applied to ice, it slowly changes its shape without breaking. One of the mechanisms by which glaciers move, called glacial creep, functions similarly, the researchers say.\n\nIn 2014, the Eindhoven University of Technology worked on a pykrete architecture project in Juuka, Finland, which included an ice dome and a pykrete scale model of the Sagrada Familia. They attempted to build the largest ice dome in the world. Due to human error, the plug to a compressor that kept the balloon inflated was pulled, leading to the balloon deflating. The team of Dutch students quickly re-inflated the balloon, and resprayed the part of the dome that had collapsed. They continued with their construction, and eventually opened the dome to the public. However within a matter of days the roof caved in; there were no visitors on the site at the time.\n\nThe durability of pykrete is still debated. Perutz has estimated a crushing strength value of around .\n\nA September 1943 proposal for making smaller pykrete vessels included the following table of characteristics:<ref name=\"ADM 1/15677\" >The National Archives, ADM 1/15677 – Proposals and inventions of Mr Geoffrey Pyke; gravity propelled ball bomb, pykrete and power driven rivers.</ref>\n\nIn 2009, the Discovery Channel program \"MythBusters\" episode 115 tested the properties of pykrete and the myths behind it. First, the program's hosts, Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman compared the mechanical properties of common ice, pykrete, and a new material specially created for the show, dubbed \"super pykrete\", using newspapers instead of woodpulp. Both versions of pykrete indeed proved to be much stronger than the chunk of ice, withstanding hundreds of pounds of weight. The super pykrete was much stronger than the original version.\n\nThe MythBusters then built a full-size boat out of the super pykrete, naming it \"Yesterday's News\", and subjected it to real-world conditions. The MythBusters vessel did not contain refrigeration units to keep the pykrete frozen as the original plans called for, and the boat had a much thinner construction than the massive ships proposed in World War II. Though the boat managed to float and stay intact at speeds of up to , it quickly began to spring leaks as the boat slowly melted. After 20 minutes the boat was deteriorating, and the experiment was ended. The boat lasted another 10 minutes while being piloted back to shore. Though the boat worked, it was noted that it would be highly impractical for the original proposal, which claimed that an entire aircraft carrier could be built out of pykrete. Their conclusion was \"Plausible, but ludicrous\", since it would involve building vessels out of tens of thousands of tons of the material that would sink without being kept cool.\n\nIn 2010, the BBC programme \"Bang Goes the Theory\" episode 26 tested a , 5-tonne pykrete boat made with hemp rather than wood pulp. All four presenters, Jem Stansfield, Dallas Campbell, Liz Bonnin, and Yan Wong, had to be rescued from Portsmouth Harbour after the boat took on water through the engine mounts. It eventually capsized after melting much faster than anticipated in the warmer-than-expected September waters.\n\nNeal Stephenson's novel \"Seveneves\" describes the fictional use of pykrete to construct low earth orbit habitats and space ship hulls for humans to survive the destruction that follows the breakup of the Moon.\n\n99% Invisible's 3rd volume of mini-stories podcasts includes an article about Project Habbakuk and the creation, proposal, and eventual scrapping of pykrete as a useful building material during WWII.\n\nScience & Futurism with Isaac Arthur Youtube episode \"Colonizing Ceres\" describes the fictional use of pykrete to construct a dome habitat on an asteroid to be mined.\n\n\n"}

The most important taxes are collected on federal level, these taxes include an income tax, social security, corporate taxes and value added tax. At the local level, property taxes as well as various fees are collected. Tax revenue stood at 48% GDP in 2012.\n\nThe effective taxation rate in Belgium is commonly cited as among the highest in the world; see list of countries by tax rates.\n\nIncome tax is calculated by applying a progressive tax rate schedule to taxable income, with rates that go from 25% to a maximum rate 50%. The rates, as of 2015, are as follows:\nFurthermore, a long list of tax allowances can be deducted from both the employer and the employee, including a general deduction, benefits deduction, and a deduction for dependents. Tax deductions are granted according to the following table: \nEmployment income is also subject to social security contributions. Employee contributions are 13.07% and are deducted by the employer.

{"id": "292269", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=292269", "title": "Third Way", "text": "Third Way\n\nThe Third Way is a position akin to centrism that tries to reconcile right-wing and left-wing politics by advocating a varying synthesis of some centre-right economic and some centre-left social policies. The Third Way was created as a re-evaluation of political policies within various centre-left progressive movements in response to doubt regarding the economic viability of the state and the overuse of economic interventionist policies that had previously been popularized by Keynesianism but at that time contrasted with the rise of popularity for economic liberalism and the New Right. The Third Way is promoted by social liberal movements.\n\nMajor Third Way social democratic proponent Tony Blair claimed that the socialism he advocated was different from traditional conceptions of socialism and said: \"My kind of socialism is a set of values based around notions of social justice...Socialism as a rigid form of economic determinism has ended, and rightly\". Blair referred to it as \"social-ism\" that involves politics that recognized individuals as socially interdependent and advocated social justice, social cohesion, equal worth of each citizen and equal opportunity. Third Way social democratic theorist Anthony Giddens has said that the Third Way rejects the traditional conception of socialism and instead accepts the conception of socialism as conceived of by Anthony Crosland as an ethical doctrine that views social democratic governments as having achieved a viable ethical socialism by removing the unjust elements of capitalism by providing social welfare and other policies and that contemporary socialism has outgrown the Marxist claim for the need of the abolition of capitalism. In 2009, Blair publicly declared support for a \"new capitalism\".\n\nThe Third Way supports the pursuit of greater egalitarianism in society through action to increase the distribution of skills, capacities and productive endowments while rejecting income redistribution as the means to achieve this. It emphasizes commitment to balanced budgets, providing equal opportunity which is combined with an emphasis on personal responsibility, the decentralization of government power to the lowest level possible, encouragement and promotion of public–private partnerships, improving labour supply, investment in human development, preserving of social capital and protection of the environment. The Third Way has been criticized by conservatives, classical liberals, and libertarians who advocate \"laissez-faire\" capitalism. It has also been heavily criticized by social democrats, democratic socialists, anarchists and communists in particular as a betrayal of left-wing values. Specific definitions of Third Way policies may differ between Europe and the United States.\n\nThe term \"Third Way\" has been used to explain a variety of political courses and ideologies in the last few centuries. These ideas were implemented by progressives in the early 20th century.\n\nThe term was picked up again in the 1950s by German ordoliberal economists such as Wilhelm Röpke, resulting in the development of the concept of the social market economy. Later Röpke distanced himself from the term and located the social market economy as \"first way\" in the sense of an advancement of the free market economy.\n\nIn Czechoslovakia during the Prague Spring in 1968, reform communist economist Ota Šik proposed third way economic reform, as part of political liberalization and democratization within socialist society.\n\nSubsequently, Enrico Berlinguer, General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party in the 1970s and 1980s, used the term \"Third Way\" to advocate a vision of a socialist society which was more pluralist than the \"real socialism\" which was typically advocated by official communist parties, whilst being more economically egalitarian than social democracy. This was part of the wider trend of Eurocommunism in the official communist movement and provided a theoretical basis for Berlinguer's pursuit of a Historic Compromise with the Italian Christian Democrats.\n\nMost significantly, Harold Macmillan, British Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963, based his philosophy of government on what he summarized in a book, \"The Middle Way\" (1938).\n\nThe Third Way has been defined as such: \n\nA variant of the Third Way exists which approaches the centre from a social democratic perspective. It has been advocated by its proponents as an alternative to both capitalism and what it regards as the traditional forms of socialism, including Marxist socialism and state socialism, that Third Way social democrats reject. It advocates ethical socialism, reformism and gradualism that includes advocating the humanization of capitalism, a mixed economy, political pluralism and liberal democracy.\n\nIt has been advocated by proponents as a \"competition socialism\", an ideology in between traditional socialism and capitalism. A prominent social democratic proponent of the Third Way, Anthony Giddens, has publicly supported a modernized form of socialism within the social democracy movement, but claims that \"traditional socialist\" ideology (referring to state socialism) that involves economic management and planning are flawed and states as a theory of the managed economy that socialism barely exists any longer.\n\nIn defining the Third Way, Tony Blair once wrote: \"The Third Way stands for a modernized social democracy, passionate in its commitment to social justice\".\n\nUnder the nominally centre-left Australian Labor Party (ALP) from 1983 to 1996, the Bob Hawke and Paul Keating governments pursued many economic policies associated with economic rationalism, such as floating the Australian Dollar in 1983, reductions in trade tariffs, taxation reforms, changing from centralized wage-fixing to enterprise bargaining, heavy restrictions on union activities including on strike action and pattern bargaining, the privatization of government run services and enterprises such as Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank and wholesale deregulation of the banking system. Keating also proposed a Goods and Services Tax (GST) in 1985, but this was scrapped due to its unpopularity amongst both Labor and electorate. The party also desisted from other reforms, such as wholesale labour market deregulation (e.g. WorkChoices), the eventual GST, the privatization of Telstra and welfare reform including \"work for the dole\", which John Howard and the Liberal Party of Australia were to initiate after winning office in 1996.\n\nVarious ideological beliefs were factionalized under reforms to the ALP under Gough Whitlam, resulting in what is now known as the Labor Left, who tend to favour a more interventionist economic policy, more authoritative top-down controls and some socially progressive ideals; and Labor Right, the now dominant faction that is pro-business, more economically liberal and focuses to a lesser extent on social issues. The Whitlam government was first to use the term economic rationalism. The Gough Whitlam Labor government from 1972 to 1975 changed from a democratic socialism platform to social democracy, their precursor to the party's \"Third Way\" policies. Under the Whitlam government, tariffs across the board were cut by 25 per cent after 23 years of Labor being in opposition.\n\nFormer Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's first speech to parliament in 1998 stated: Competitive markets are massive and generally efficient generators of economic wealth. They must therefore have a central place in the management of the economy. But markets sometimes fail, requiring direct government intervention through instruments such as industry policy. There are also areas where the public good dictates that there should be no market at all. We are not afraid of a vision in the Labor Party, but nor are we afraid of doing the hard policy yards necessary to turn that vision into reality. Parties of the Centre Left around the world are wrestling with a similar challenge—the creation of a competitive economy while advancing the overriding imperative of a just society. Some call this the \"third way\". The nomenclature is unimportant. What is important is that it is a repudiation of Thatcherism and its Australian derivatives represented opposite. It is in fact a new formulation of the nation's economic and social imperatives.\n\nRudd was critical of free market economists such as Friedrich Hayek, although Rudd described himself as \"basically a conservative when it comes to questions of public financial management\", pointing to his slashing of public service jobs as a Queensland governmental advisor.\n\nThe Italian Democratic Party is a plural social democratic party including several distinct ideologic trends. Politicians such as former Prime Ministers Matteo Renzi and Romano Prodi are Third Way-ers.\n\nUnder Renzi's secretariat, the Democratic Party took a strong stance in favour of constitutional reform and of a new electoral law, on the road toward a two-party system.\n\nIt is not an easy task to find the exact political trend represented by Renzi and his supporters, who have been known as \"Renziani\". The nature of Renzi's progressivism is a matter of debate and has been linked both to liberalism and populism. According to Maria Teresa Meli of \"Corriere della Sera\", Renzi \"pursues a precise model, borrowed from the Labour Party and Bill Clinton's Democratic Party\", comprising \"a strange mix (for Italy) of liberal policy in the economic sphere and populism. This means that on one side he will attack the privileges of trade unions, especially of the CGIL, which defends only the already protected, while on the other he will sharply attack the vested powers, bankers, \"Confindustria\" and a certain type of capitalism\".\n\nRenzi has occasionally been compared to former British Prime Minister Tony Blair for his political views. Renzi himself has previously claimed to be as supporter of Blair's ideology of the Third Way, regarding an objective to synthesize liberal economics and left-wing social policies.\n\nIn 1938, Harold Macmillan wrote a book entitled \"The Middle Way\", advocating a compromise between capitalism and socialism, which was a precursor to the contemporary notion of the Third Way.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Tony Blair is cited as a Third Way politician. According to a former member of Blair's staff, Labour and Blair learnt from and owes a debt to Bob Hawke's government in Australia in the 1980s on how to govern as a \"third way\" party. Blair wrote in a Fabian pamphlet in 1994 of the existence of two prominent variants of socialism: one is based on a Marxist economic determinist and collectivist tradition and the other is an \"ethical socialism\" based on values of \"social justice, the equal worth of each citizen, equality of opportunity, community\". Blair is a particular follower of the ideas and writings of Giddens, as was his successor Gordon Brown.\n\nIn 1998, Blair, then Labour leader and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, described the relation between social democracy and Third Way as the following: \n\nIn the United States, \"Third Way\" adherents embrace fiscal conservatism to a greater extent than traditional economic liberals, advocate some replacement of welfare with workfare and sometimes have a stronger preference for market solutions to traditional problems (as in pollution markets) while rejecting pure \"laissez-faire\" economics and other libertarian positions. The Third Way style of governing was firmly adopted and partly redefined during the administration of President Bill Clinton. The term \"Third Way\" was introduced by political scientist Stephen Skowronek. \"Third Way\" presidents \"undermine the opposition by borrowing policies from it in an effort to seize the middle and with it to achieve political dominance\". Examples of this are Nixon’s economic policies, which were a continuation of Johnson's \"Great Society\", as well as Clinton’s welfare reform later.\n\nClinton, Blair, Prodi, Gerhard Schröder and other leading Third Way adherents organized conferences to promote the Third Way philosophy in 1997 at Chequers in England. The Third Way think tank and the Democratic Leadership Council are adherents of Third Way politics.\n\nOther leaders who have adopted elements of the Third Way style of governance include Gerhard Schröder of Germany, Wim Kok of the Netherlands, António Guterres and José Sócrates of Portugal, Ehud Barak of Israel, David Lange, Roger Douglas and Helen Clark in New Zealand, François Hollande, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Manuel Valls and Emmanuel Macron in France, Costas Simitis in Greece, Viktor Klima and Alfred Gusenbauer in Austria, Ingvar Carlsson and Göran Persson in Sweden, Paavo Lipponen in Finland, Helle Thorning-Schmidt in Denmark, Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun in South Korea, Jean Chrétien and Paul Martin in Canada, Ferenc Gyurcsány in Hungary, Victor Ponta in Romania, Leszek Miller and Marek Belka in Poland, Fernando Henrique Cardoso in Brazil, Alan Garcia and Alejandro Toledo in Peru, Thabo Mbeki in South Africa, Muammar Gaddafi of Jamahiriya-era Libya and Ricardo Lagos and Michelle Bachelet in Chile. \n\nIn 1990, after the dismantling of his country's communist government Czechoslovakia's conservative finance minister Václav Klaus declared: \"We want a market economy without any adjectives. Any compromises with that will only fuzzy up the problems we have. To pursue a so-called 'third way' is foolish. We had our experience with this in the 1960s when we looked for a socialism with a human face. It did not work, and we must be explicit that we are not aiming for a more efficient version of a system that has failed. The market is indivisible; it cannot be an instrument in the hands of central planners\". However, it should be noted that in historical context the \"third way\" proposals of 1960s Czechoslovakia were better described as \"liberalized centrally-planned socialism\" rather than the \"socially-sensitive capitalism\" that Third Way policies tend to have been identified with in the West.\n\nLeft-wing opponents of the Third Way argue that it represents social democrats who responded to the New Right by accepting capitalism. The Third Way most commonly uses market mechanics and private ownership of the means of production and in that sense it is fundamentally capitalistic. In addition to opponents who have noticed this, other reviews have claimed that Third Way social democrats adjusted to the political climate since the 1980s that favoured capitalism by recognizing that outspoken opposition to capitalism in these circumstances was politically nonviable and that accepting capitalism as the current powers that be and seeking to administer it to challenge \"laissez-faire\" capitalists was a more pressing immediate concern.\n\nCharles Clarke, a former United Kingdom Home Secretary and the first senior \"Blairite\" to attack Prime Minister Gordon Brown openly and in print, stated: \"We should discard the techniques of 'triangulation' and 'dividing lines' with the Conservatives, which lead to the not entirely unjustified charge that we simply follow proposals from the Conservatives or the right-wing media, to minimize differences and remove lines of attack against us\".\n\nIn 2013, American lawyer and former bank regulator William K. Black wrote that \"Third Way is this group that pretends sometimes to be center-left but is actually completely a creation of Wall Street—it's run by Wall Street for Wall Street with this false flag operation as if it were a center-left group. It's nothing of the sort\".\n\nThe shift towards a political discourse heavily influenced by social capital is observable comparing the 1979 and 1997 Labour Party manifestos (Ferragina and Arrigoni 2016). In 1979, the Labour Party professed a complete adherence to social democratic ideals and rejected the choice between a \"prosperous and efficient Britain\" and a \"caring and compassionate Britain\" (Labour Party, 1979: 23). Coherent with this position, the main commitment of the party was the reduction of economic inequality via the introduction of a wealth tax (Labour Party, 1979: 1). In the 1990s, this agenda drastically changed with the progressive dismissal of traditional social democratic ideology. In particular, New Labour de-emphasized the need to tackle economic inequality and instead focused its political strategy on the expansion of opportunities for all, keeping public intervention in the market to a minimum. In this context, the aim to foster social capital creation by holding together the modernization of the state and the creation of stronger social ties became the flagship of New Labour (Ferragina and Arrigoni 2016:5).\n\nThis change of political orientation was based on a profound revision of social democratic principles. These principles were considered by New Labour to be an obstacle to the activation of evidence-based policy-making. In this context, the prevention of market failures, which is targeting child poverty and educational disadvantage, was preferred over the redistributive approach endorsed by the Labour Party during the 1970s. The new vision implied the full acceptance of market principles and pushed traditional social democratic values even further away. This ideological shift took place despite the fact that the period between 1979 and 1995 was characterized by the sharpest increase in economic inequality since World War II (Ferragina and Arrigoni 2016: 5).\n\nThe importance attributed to the creation of social capital is symptomatic of New Labour's interest in civil society. This interest can be explained by the effect of growing individual freedom, fostered by economic and technological modernization, in a context where traditional forms of solidarity and interdependence are needed to prevent social disintegration; a \"social paradox\" already identified by the founding fathers of sociology. For this reason, New Labour considered the creation of social capital as a good antidote to the tension between traditional and modern values.\n\nTony Blair proposed to manage social change by unifying moral values, represented by the Tocquevillian quest for community and scientific evidence, used to inform evidence-based policy-making. According to Blair, the fusion of these two elements in the Third Way was the only remedy for the social paradox illustrated above. One could say, as Durkheim, that during an age of modernization and transformation the values cultivated in secondary groups need to be universally accepted because they confer a human face to a society dominated by competition and the pursuit of efficiency. In this vision, the creation of social capital balances growing individualism with the need for interdependence, serving as a sort of glue to prevent modernization from heading towards societal disintegration. After merging social capital’s argument and the Third Way discourse (Giddens,1998), New Labour also bridged theory and practice through policy making at various levels, that is in education, health and neighbourhoods; and attempting to measure the direct impact of these reforms on social capital. In this context, the objective of creating social capital through the empowerment of families and communities and the decentralization of social services became one of the leading driving forces of New Labour's political action (Ferragina and Arrigoni 2016: 5).\n\nAccording to one article submitted in 2017 to an open-contribution website, marketMogul.com, the Third Way movement was at its peak in the 1990s and 2000s, but has since been on the decline, and by 2017 it becomes clear that the ideology is not as popular as it used to be outside of established Third Way circles. Third Way economic policies began to be challenged following the Great Recession. The rise of Right-wing populism has put the ideology into question. Many on the left have become more vocal in opposition to the Third Way, with the most prominent example in the United Kingdom being the rise of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. A large number of Third Way politicians have been either voted out of office or forced to change their positions due to the ideology's weakening base. However, in 2017, Emmanuel Macron was elected President of France, which has given some hope to Third Way proponents.\n\n\n\n"}

It provided for the return to China of the eastern part of the Ili Basin region, also known as Zhetysu occupied by Russia in 1871 during the Dungan Revolt up to 1881.\n\nDuring the Russian conquest of Turkestan Russia gained control of eastern Kazakhstan up to the current Chinese border. During the Dungan Revolt China lost control of much of its western territory and power passed to various factions. In 1871 Russia occupied the Ili territory. There was talk of permanent annexation, but Saint Petersburg declared that it was occupying the territory to protect its citizens. Chinese authority in Xinjiang was reestablished by 1877. Wanyan Chonghou was sent to Russia to negotiate. In September 1879, he concluded the Treaty of Livadia. Russia would retain the Tekes valley at the southwest end of the Ili Valley and passes over the mountains to the Tarim Basin. China would pay 5 million rubles and various trade concessions were made. In January 1880 Chonghou returned to Peking and was greeted with indignation. He was declared to have betrayed his country, was arrested and later sentenced to death. Zeng Jize, was appointed as the new ambassador. Russia refused to negotiate unless Chonghou was released and this was backed by the other powers. In August 1880 Chonghou was released and negotiations resumed. The Treaty of Saint Petersburg was concluded on and ratified within six months. Two years later (March 1883) Russia evacuated the province. There were some minor border problems and a final protocol was signed on .\n\nThe Russian side was represented by Nicholas de Giers, head of Asiatic Affairs department of Foreign Ministry (who later in 1882 ascended to the Minister's seat), and Eugene Bützow, Russia's Ambassador in China.\n\nAccording to the treaty (Article 1), Russia agreed to return most of the occupied area to China. The Chinese government agreed (Article 2) to hold the residents of the area, regardless of their ethnicity and religion, harmless for their actions during the rebellion. The residents of the area would be allowed (Article 3) to stay or to move to Russian Empire; they would be asked about their choice before the withdrawal of the Russian troops.\n\nUnder Article 6 of the treaty, Chinese government would pay Russia 9,000,000 \"metal rubles\" (; ; probably, silver roubles are meant) to serve as a payment for the occupation costs, compensation for the claims of Russian subjects who lost their property during the rebellion, and for material assistance to the families of Russian subjects killed during the rebellion.\n\nArticle 7 set the new international border in the Ili Valley. The area west of the border was retained by Russia \"for the settlement of the region's residents who will choose to become Russian subjects and will have to leave the lands that they have owned\" east of the new border.\n\nThe treaty also provided (Article 8) for minor adjustments of the border between the two countries in the area east of Lake Zaysan (where today East Kazakhstan Province borders on the northern part of Xinjiang's Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture).\n\nArticle 10 of the treaty allowed Russia to expand its consular network in the northwestern parts of the Chinese Empire (Xinjiang, Gansu, and Outer Mongolia). Besides the consulates in Ili City (Kulja), Tarbagatai (Chuguchak, Tacheng), Kashgar and Urga (Ulan Bator) provided for in earlier treaties (see Treaty of Kulja, 1851), Russia would also open consulates in Suzhou (Jiuquan), and Turpan. In Kobdo (Khovd), Uliasutai (Uliastai), Hami (Kumul), Urumqi, and Gucheng (Qitai), Russia would be allowed to establish consulates later on, as demanded by the volume of trade.\n\nArticle 12 affirmed the right of duty-free trade for Russian traders in Mongolia and Xinjiang. The treaty also contained various provisions designed to facilitate activities of Russian merchants and to regulate bilateral trade. An appendix to the treaty specified the list of border crossings the two countries were to operate.\n\nThe Treaty of Saint Petersburg was perceived as a huge loss and step backward by many in Russia, as Minister of War Dmitry Milyutin and the military, as notable commander Aleksei Brusilov.\n\nSeveral thousands Dungan (Hui) and Taranchi (Uyghur) families made use of the treaty to move to Russian-controlled territory, i.e. to today's south-eastern Kazakhstan and northern Kyrgyzstan. While some of them soon returned to China, most stayed in Russian domains, and descendents of them have lived in Kazakhstan and Northern Kyrgyzstan ever since.\n\nThe border between the two empires set by Article 7 of the treaty remains the border between Kazakhstan and China until this day.\n\nHistorians have judged the Qing dynasty's vulnerability and weakness to foreign imperialism in the 19th century to be based mainly on its maritime naval weakness while it achieved military success against westerners on land, the historian Edward L. Dreyer said that \"China’s nineteenth-century humiliations were strongly related to her weakness and failure at sea. At the start of the Opium War, China had no unified navy and no sense of how vulnerable she was to attack from the sea; British forces sailed and steamed wherever they wanted to go...In the Arrow War (1856-60), the Chinese had no way to prevent the Anglo-French expedition of 1860 from sailing into the Gulf of Zhili and landing as near as possible to Beijing. Meanwhile, new if not exactly modern Chinese armies suppressed the midcentury rebellions, bluffed Russia into a peaceful settlement of disputed frontiers in Central Asia, and defeated the French forces on land in the Sino-French War (1884-85). But the defeat of the fleet, and the resulting threat to steamship traffic to Taiwan, forced China to conclude peace on unfavorable terms.\"\n\nThe Qing dynasty forced Russia to hand over disputed territory in the Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1881), in what was seen as a \"diplomatic victory\" against Russia. Russia acknowledged that Qing China potentially posed a serious military threat. Mass media in the west during this era portrayed China as a rising military power due to its modernization programs and as a major threat to the western world, invoking fears that China would successfully conquer western colonies like Australia.\n\nThe British observer Demetrius Charles de Kavanagh Boulger suggested a British-Chinese alliance to check Russian expansion in Central Asia.\n\nDuring the Ili crisis when Qing China threatened to go to war against Russia over the Russian occupation of Ili, the British officer Charles George Gordon was sent to China by Britain to advise China on military options against Russia should a potential war break out between China and Russia.\n\nThe Russians observed the Chinese building up their arsenal of modern weapons during the Ili crisis, the Chinese bought thousands of rifles from Germany. In 1880 massive amounts of military equipment and rifles were shipped via boats to China from Antwerp as China purchased torpedoes, artillery, and 260,260 modern rifles from Europe.\n\nThe Russian military observer D. V. Putiatia visited China in 1888 and found that in Northeastern China (Manchuria) along the Chinese-Russian border,the Chinese soldiers were potentially able to become adept at \"European tactics\" under certain circumstances, and the Chinese soldiers were armed with modern weapons like Krupp artillery, Winchester carbines, and Mauser rifles.\n\nCompared to Russian controlled areas, more benefits were given to the Muslim Kirghiz (Kazakhs) on the Chinese controlled areas. Russian settlers fought against the Muslim nomadic Kirghiz, which led the Russians to believe that the Kirghiz would be a liability in any conflict against China. The Muslim Kirghiz were sure that in an upcoming war, that China would defeat Russia.\n\nRussian sinologists, the Russian media, threat of internal rebellion, the pariah status inflicted by the Congress of Berlin, the negative state of the Russian economy all led Russia to concede and negotiate with China in St Petersburg, and return most of Ili to China.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "26177599", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26177599", "title": "Universal Periodic Review", "text": "Universal Periodic Review\n\nThe Universal Periodic Review (UPR) is a mechanism of the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council (HRC) that emerged from the 2005 UN reform process. Commonly referred to as the UN-UPR, it was established by General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 3 April 2006, the UN-UPR periodically examines the human rights performance of all 193 UN Member States. It is intended to complement, not duplicate, the work of other human rights mechanisms, including the UN human rights treaty bodies.This is the first international human rights mechanism to address all countries and all human rights. The Working Group on the UPR, which is composed of the HRC’s 47 Member States and chaired by the HRC President, conducts country reviews.\n\nHRC Resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007 and HRC decision 6/102 of 27 September 2007 elaborated on the UPR’s functions in its first cycle from 2008 - 2012. For the second and subsequent cycles, a few amendments were introduced to the UPR by HRC Resolution 16/21 of 12 April 2011 and HRC decision 17/119 of 19 July 2011, after a review by the HRC (for further details, see HRC review process below). HRC resolution 5/1 provides that the UPR should: \n\nThe objectives of the UN-UPR are: \n\nHRC resolution 16/21 further provides that the second and subsequent cycles should focus on the implementation of the accepted recommendations and the developments of the human rights situation in the State under review.\n\nWhile the first UN-UPR operated on a four-year cycle, the second was extended to four and a half years, and the third lasts five years. Forty-two States are now reviewed each year during three sessions of the HRC’s Working Group on the UPR, with 14 States reviewed at each session. The HRC determined the order of review for the first UPR cycle (2008-2012) on 21 September 2007 through the drawing of lots and the same order will be maintained during the second and subsequent cycles. The first order of review was instructed by the resolution 5/1 requirements that all 47 member States of the HRC be reviewed during their term of membership, in addition to a few other criteria.\n\nThe basis of country reviews is: (a) the Charter of the UN; (b) the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; (c) human rights instruments to which a State is party; and (d) voluntary pledges and commitments made by the State, including those undertaken when presenting their candidature for election to the HRC. Country reviews also take into account applicable international humanitarian law.\n\nCountry reviews are based on three documents:\n\nIn decision 6/102, the HRC provided guidelines for the preparation of information under the UPR. It specifies that States, in preparing national reports, should address/provide:\n\nThe Working Group on the UPR is composed by the 47 Member States of the HRC, chaired by the HRC President and conducts country reviews. The Working Group held its first review in 2008. It allocates three and a half hours to each review, 70 minutes of which is given to the State under review to discuss its domestic human rights framework, measures taken to promote and protect human rights in country, human rights issues of particular national pertinence, and steps taken to address and redress violations. It is also an opportunity for the State to present voluntary human rights pledges and commitments. An interactive dialogue of 140 minutes follows the State’s presentation, during which UN member States question the State and make recommendations towards the improvement of its human rights situation and performance. It is worth noting that all 193 UN member states (both HRC members and not) can take the floor.\n\nA wide variety of issues have been addressed during the country reviews and potentially all human rights issues could be addressed during this session. While the counting of the actual number of recommendations is complicated by the fact that they are clustered together in the Working Group report, the NGO UPR Info has calculated the first cycle of the UPR to have provided a total of 21,356 recommendations and 599 voluntary pledges.\n\nEach review is facilitated by a group of three States, known as the “troika”, that serve as rapporteurs. The troika is responsible for receiving the advanced questions from UN member States to the country under review. The second role of the troika is to prepare an outcome document on the review, which includes a summary of the review proceedings, recommendations suggested by States, conclusions, and voluntary commitments presented by the State under review. The outcome document is prepared with the assistance of the UPR secretariat and the recommendations contained in the outcome of the review should preferably be clustered thematically with the full involvement and consent of the State under review and the States that made the recommendations.<ref name=\"HRCResolution16/21\">\"Review of the work and functioning of the Human Rights Council\" at 4.</ref>\n\nThirty minutes are allocated to the adoption of the outcome document at a later stage in the same Working Group session, during which the State under review is given a preliminary opportunity to indicate whether it supports the recommendations suggested to it by States as well as the conclusions reflected in the outcome document. Once adopted, the outcome document is transferred to the HRC for discussion and adoption in plenary. In the intervening period between the Working Group and plenary sessions, the reviewed State is expected to confirm which UPR recommendations it accepts and does not accept.\n\nThe UPR is a standing item on the HRC’s agenda (item 6). At each HRC session, time is allocated to the consideration and adoption of the outcome documents transferred from the Working Group on the UPR. An hour is allocated to the adoption of each document, during which the reviewed State is offered the opportunity to present replies to questions or issues not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue at the Working Group. HRC member and observer States are also given the opportunity to express their views on the outcome of the review before the HRC takes action on it. NHRIs with ‘A’ status and NGOs in consultative status with the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) have the opportunity to make ‘general comments’ before the adoption of the outcome report. This is the only opportunity for civil society to take the floor during the UPR.\n\nWhile the outcome of the review, as a cooperative mechanism, should be implemented primarily by the State concerned, States are encouraged to conduct broad consultations with all relevant stakeholders in this regard.\n\nStates are encouraged to provide the Council, on a voluntary basis, with a midterm update on follow-up to accepted recommendations. As of 20 February 2013, 28 countries so far have provided the HRC with an implementation report.\n\nAccording to Resolution 16/21, other relevant stakeholders are encouraged to include information on the follow-up to the preceding review in their contributions. The summary of the information provided by other relevant stakeholders should contain, where appropriate, a separate section for contributions by the national human rights institution of the State under review that is accredited in full compliance with the Paris Principles.\n\nThe Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance, established by the Council in its resolution 6/17, should be strengthened and operationalized in order to provide a source of financial and technical assistance to help countries to implement the recommendations emanating from their review.\n\nStates may request the United Nations representation at the national or regional level to assist them in the implementation of the follow-up to their review. Financial and technical assistance for the implementation of the review should support national needs and priorities, as may be reflected in national implementation plans.\n\nThe NGO UPR Info has from 2011 to 2014 undertaken 165 assessments at a two-years distance after the review in order to see how the recommendations (the main UPR outcome) are implemented, and what is the real effect of the UPR on the ground. In 2012 it published its first study on the assessment of these implementations by 66 countries. A second publication followed in 2014, titled Beyond Promises, assessed 165 countries and shared best practices observed from States, NHRIs, and NGOs. A third publication, released in 2016 and dubbed The Butterfly Effect, aimed to spread UPR best practices and inspire all actors.\n\nAfter exhausting all efforts to encourage a State to cooperate with the UPR mechanism, the HRC will address, as appropriate, cases of persistent non-cooperation with the mechanism.\n\nThe first case where persistent non-cooperation was discussed is Israel's UPR. Israel was not reviewed as scheduled on 29 January 2013. As a consequence, the HRC discussed in March and June 2013 the issue of \"persistent non-cooperation\". Eventually, Israel resumed its cooperation with the HRC and was reviewed on 29 October 2013, but the HRC missed the opportunity to define what \"persistent non-cooperation\" is.\n\nThe rules governing the participation of NHRIs and NGOs at the HRC, and therefore in the UPR mechanism, are prescribed by resolution 5/1, which states that their participation shall be based on the ‘practices observed by the [former] Commission on Human Rights, while ensuring the most effective contribution of these entities’.\n\nWhile the UPR is an intergovernmental process, a number of opportunities for contribution are available to non-governmental stakeholders. These include:\n\nIn resolution 60/251, the General Assembly required the HRC to review and report on its work and functioning after its first five years. In October 2009, the HRC established the open-ended intergovernmental working group on the review of the work and functioning of the HRC (composed by the 47 member States of the HRC) to lead its review process. Chaired by the then HRC President (Ambassador Sihasak Phuangketkeow of Thailand), the Working Group met for two substantive sessions. The first Working Group session took place on 25–29 October 2010; the second session was held on 7, 17-18, and 23–24 February 2011.\n\nOn 25 March 2011, the HRC adopted as resolution 16/21 the outcome of its review of the work and functioning of the HRC, later followed by HRC decision 17/119 of 19 July 2011 with the following changes to the UPR:\n\n\n"}

At that time the title of \"čelnik\" was of a higher rank than \"stavilac\", but lower than \"kaznac\" and \"tepčija\", with \"vojvoda\" being the supreme title. It is unclear if there was one or several with that title at the court at that time.\n\nDuring King Stefan Dečanski's reign there were two or three title holders at the same time. During Stefan Dušan's reign, the title of veliki čelnik is first mentioned. The \"veliki čelnik\" supervised over several čelniks, each \"čelnik\" being a commander of military fortifications (and presumably its troops) or a senior (\"starešina\") of a larger number of villages. After Jovan Oliver and Dimitrije, it seems that the title was not given at the court of Stefan Dušan. During the service of Branilo (fl. 1347) and Đurica (fl. 1350), there is also a mention of Andronik, a čelnik in Polog, though he likely was not of the same category as the former two.\n\n\nAt the beginning of the 15th century, during the Serbian Despotate, the title of \"veliki čelnik\" was the equivalent of count palatine and was the highest court title, with the title-holders holding great provinces, property and honours. Of these, Radič ( 1413–41) was the most notable.\n\n\n\n"}
