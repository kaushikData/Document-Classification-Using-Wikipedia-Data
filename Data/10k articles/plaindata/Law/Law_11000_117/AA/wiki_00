After the death of the 10th Panchen Lama, a dispute between the Chinese leadership and the exiled 14th Dalai Lama resulted in two competing candidates. The search committee process involving monks in Tibet under the strict supervision of the Chinese communist regime was disrupted when the Dalai Lama, according to the Tibetan tradition, unilaterally announced his selection of Gedhun Choekyi Nyima. The leadership in China spirited Nyima away to prevent his being taken to India by the Dalai Lama's supporters and reverted to the Qing Dynasty's Golden Urn process to select Gyaincain Norbu. \n\nThree days after the death of the 10th Panchen Lama, the Premier of the State Council published decision on how the 11th Panchen Lama would be selected based on the feedback gathered from the committee of Tashi Lhunpo Monastery and monks on January 30th 1989. \n\nFive years after the death of the 10th Panchen Lama, ordinarily, the 11th Panchen Lama would have already been identified. The Nechung Oracle in Dharamsala had been consulted on the matter.\n\nTibetans would not consider a candidate for the eleventh incarnation legitimate unless he were identified according to Tibetan traditional means, including a search by the tenth's senior staff based on dreams and omens, and formal recognition of the result by the Dalai Lama. On the other hand, the leaders of the Chinese government wanted the process to demonstrate their authority. Beijing planned to have the traditional group of monks follow traditional methods, but to identify a group of candidates, not only one, and then to use the Golden Urn to randomly select one of them, and to exclude the Dalai Lama from the process altogether. \n\nHowever, Beijing later allowed Tashilhunpo Monastery's Chadrel Rinpoche, the head of the search team, to communicate with the Dalai Lama, currently exiled and an opponent of the regime, in hopes that a mutually acceptable process and candidate could be accomplished. At the end of 1994, twenty-five candidates had been identified, and Chadrel sent the Dalai Lama detailed information on all of them; but Chadrel also wrote that all signs pointed to Gedhun Choekyi Nyima as the true reincarnation. In February 1995, the Dalai Lama replied to Chadrel that his own divinations confirmed Gedhun Choekyi Nyima. Chadrel intended to publicly mimic the process that occurred in identifying the tenth Panchen Lama in 1949: the urn would not be used; China would be first to publicly name the choice; and then the Dalai Lama would confirm it. However, in March 1995, Chinese officials insisted on drawing a name from three to five slips in the urn. On May 14, 1995, the Dalai Lama preempted the drawing by publicly announcing that Gedhun Choekyi Nyima was the eleventh Panchen Lama. \n\nIn November 1995, the Chinese government selected a different boy, Gyaincain Norbu, using the Golden Urn. This decision was immediately denounced by the Dalai Lama. China holds Gedhun Choekyi Nyima in a place whose location has not been divulged to the public. \n\nIn May 1997, Chadrel was sentenced to six years in prison for splittism and betraying state secrets.\n\n"}

This was repealed, however, by the Finance Act 1949. \n\nOnly one section of the Act remains in British law - Section 7, which states that auctioneers must place a board with their full name and residence that is \"publicly visible and legible\" in the room where the auction takes place before, during and after the auction. This was to allow people to make formal complaints against auctioneers in cases of fraud or other offenses. This section was expanded by the Auctions (Bidding Agreements) Act 1927, to impose a penalty of 20 pounds sterling upon any auctioneer who failed to follow the Act. \n"}
{"id": "8949188", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8949188", "title": "Bill of particulars", "text": "Bill of particulars\n\nIn common law jurisdictions, a bill of particulars is a detailed, formal, written statement of charges or claims by a plaintiff or the prosecutor given upon the defendant's formal request to the court for more detailed information. A bill of particulars may be used in either criminal defense or in civil litigation.\n\nIn criminal law, defense attorneys may file a motion requesting a bill of particulars from prosecuting attorneys. However, prosecuting attorneys cannot request the same of the defense. This request may be part of an omnibus motion, motion in limine, or similar motion.\n\nIn a civil action such as a tort or breach of contract case, either attorney or party can request it. It is rarely used in American small claims cases. It is not entirely clear whether this can be done in practice in Britain on the Allocation questionnaire. An insufficient response to a request for a bill of particulars may be grounds for dismissal of the claim, or other sanctions against the responding party. In civil cases, a bill of particulars is a pleading, which \"amplifies\" the complaint, but can also act as a discovery device or tool.\n\nThe Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provide in rule 7(f) that \"the court may direct the government to file a bill of particulars\".\n\nIn U.S. state law, the bill of particulars was abolished in nearly all court systems in the 1940s and 1950s due to the widespread recognition that much of the information requested could be obtained more efficiently through the discovery process. Today, only a minority of U.S. states, like New York, Illinois, California (CCP 454), and Virginia, use the bill of particulars, and even there motions for a bill of particulars may be disfavored or disused. In Illinois, for instance, it is more common for defendants to file a motion to dismiss under the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure § 2-615, claiming the pleaded facts to be insufficient to support the causes of action alleged. It has been observed, however, that the motion for a bill of particulars may have strategic advantages over a § 2-615 motion, because the latter, even where successful, usually results in the plaintiff being given an opportunity to refile. A bill of particulars, however, once submitted, confines the pleader to any causes of action or defenses in the bill. The closest modern equivalent, though rarely used, is the motion for a more definite statement.\n\n"}

Consequently, they are treated as authoritative statements of the law as it is at the present time, unless it is shown that the law has changed, and may be cited and relied on in court as such.\n\nThe statements made in these books are presumed to be evidence of judicial decisions which are no longer extant. The primary reason for this practice is the difficulty associated with ascertaining the law of the medieval and early modern periods.\n\nOn the subject of this practice, William Blackstone said:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditionally, Ralph de Hengham was believed to be a prolific author of common law procedural treatises, and numerous works were attributed to him. These included not only the eponymous \"Hengham parva\" and \"Hengham magna\", but also \"Cum sit necessarium\", \"Exceptiones ad Cassandum Brevia\", \"Fet Asaver\", \"Judicium Essoniorum\", and \"Modus Componendi Brevia\", among others. More recent scholarly analysis, however, reveals that only the \"Parva\" (a set of lectures directed towards junior-level law students) is conclusively his.

{"id": "479171", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=479171", "title": "Commodity Futures Trading Commission", "text": "Commodity Futures Trading Commission\n\nThe U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is an independent agency of the US government created in 1974, that regulates futures and option markets.\n\nThe Commodities Exchange Act (\"CEA\"), \"et seq.\", prohibits fraudulent conduct in the trading of futures contracts. The stated mission of the CFTC is to foster open, transparent, competitive, and financially sound markets, to avoid systemic risk, and to protect the market users and their funds, consumers, and the public from fraud, manipulation, and abusive practices related to derivatives and other products that are subject to the Commodity Exchange Act.\nAfter the Financial crisis of 2007–2008 and since 2010 with the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, CFTC has been transitioning to bring more transparency and stricter regulation to the multitrillion dollar swaps market.\n\nFutures contracts for agricultural commodities have been traded in the U.S. for more than 150 years and have been under Federal regulation since the 1920s. The Grain Futures Act of 1922 set the basic authority and was changed by the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (7 U.S.C. 1 et seq.).\n\nSince the 1970s, trading in futures contracts has expanded rapidly beyond traditional physical and agricultural commodities into a vast array of financial instruments, including foreign currencies, U.S. and foreign government securities, and U.S. and foreign stock indices.\n\nCongress created the CFTC in 1974 as an independent agency with the mandate to regulate. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-463) created the CFTC to replace the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Commodity Exchange Authority as the independent federal agency responsible for regulating commodity futures and option markets in the United States. The Act made extensive changes in the basic authority of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) of 1936, which itself had made extensive changes in the original Grain Futures Act of 1922. (7 U.S.C. 1 et seq.).\n\nCFTC's mandate was renewed and expanded in December 2000 when Congress passed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000, which instructed the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the CFTC to develop a joint regulatory regime for single-stock futures, the products of which began trading in November 2002. As of 2003 the growth in the value of swaps had exploded since their introduction in the late 1970s.\n\nIn 2010, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, expanded the CFTC's authority into the swaps markets, to prohibit the reckless use of manipulative schemes without -as in the past- having to prove the specific intent of the accused to affect prices and the existence of an artificial price.\n\nThe CFTC assures utility of the futures markets by encouraging their competitiveness and efficiency, ensuring their integrity, protecting market participants against manipulation, abusive trading practices, and fraud, and ensuring the financial integrity of the clearing process. The CFTC like the SEC, does not directly regulate the safety and soundness of individual firms, with the exception of newly regulated swap dealers and major swap participants, for whom it sets capital standards pursuant to Dodd-Frank. \nThrough oversight, the CFTC enables the futures markets to serve the function of price discovery and offsetting price risk.\n\nAs of 2014 the CFTC oversees 'designated contract markets' (DCMs) or exchanges, swap execution facilities (SEFs), derivatives clearing organizations, swap data repository, swap dealers, futures commission merchants, commodity pool operators and other intermediaries. The CFTC coordinates its work with foreign regulators, such as its UK counterpart, the Financial Conduct Authority, which supervises the London Metal Exchange.\n\nIn 1998 CFTC chairperson Brooksley E. Born lobbied Congress and the President to give the CFTC oversight of 'off-exchange markets' for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives in addition to its existing oversight of exchange-traded derivatives, but her warnings were opposed by other regulators.\n\nTwo actions by the CFTC in 1998 led some market participants to express concerns that the CFTC might modify the \"Swap Exemption\" and attempt to impose new regulations on the swap market. First, in a February 1998 comment letter addressing the SEC's \"broker-dealer lite\" proposal, the CFTC stated that the SEC's proposal would create the potential for conflict with the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) to the extent that certain OTC derivative instruments fall within the ambit of the CEA and are subject to the exclusive statutory authority of the CFTC.\n\nIn May 1998 the CFTC issued a 'concept release' requesting comment on whether regulation of OTC derivatives markets was appropriate and, if so, what form such regulation should take. Legislation enacted in 1999 at the request of the US Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board, and the SEC limited the CFTC's rulemaking authority with respect to swaps and hybrid instruments until March 30, 1999, and froze the pre-existing legal status of swap agreements and hybrid instruments entered into in reliance on the 'Swap Exemption', the 'Hybrid Instrument Rule', the 'Swap Policy Statement, or the 'Hybrid Interpretation'. The text of that act read: \"...the Commission may not propose or issue any rule or regulation, or issue any interpretation or policy statement, that restricts or regulates activity in a qualifying hybrid instrument or swap agreement\". Shortly after Congress had passed this legislation prohibiting CFTC from regulating derivatives, Born resigned. She later commented the failure of Long-Term Capital Management and the subsequent bailout as being indicative what she had been trying to prevent.\n\nSince 1991 the CFTC has given secret exemptions from hedging regulations to 19 major banks and market participants, allowing them to accumulate essentially unlimited positions. These exemptions came to light only after the 2008 financial crisis had unfolded and Congress requested information on market participants. A trader or bank granted an exemption as a bona-fide hedger can affect the price of a commodity without being either its producer or consumer.\n\nIn December 2007 during the subprime mortgage crisis, the CFTC began investigating transportation, storage and trading of U.S. crude oil for price manipulation, which included a probe of U.S. crude oil futures. By May 2008, when the price of crude oil futures showed a meteoric rise of 40% to a record $US 135 a barrel there were concerns that the record prices may have been the result of \"manipulation or fraud\".\nMichael Haigh, head of U.S. commodities research in New York at Société Générale SA, and former CFTC associate chief economist, said in an interview \"It's unprecedented for the CFTC to say that they are in the midst of an investigation.[..] \"They may be under pressure from Congress to look at this market given the high prices.\" Some argued that crude oil market fundamentals drive the price, not the speculative market.\nOn June 25, 2008 Speaker Pelosi sent a letter to President Bush calling on him to direct the CFTC to use its emergency powers to take immediate action to curb excessive speculation in energy markets, to investigate all energy contracts and that despite growing reports of excessive speculation in energy markets, the CFTC refused to take actions they have taken in the past. The Energy Markets Emergency Act of 2008 was a failed bill that would have attempted to curb excessive speculation in the energy futures markets.\n\nIn a campaign speech August 2008 presidential candidate Barack Obama argued that loopholes in CFTC regulations contributed to skyrocketing prices and lack of transparency on oil markets.\n\nIn April 2010 Reuters reported that of the \"40 major figures in the oil industry, including traders and analysts at some of the largest banks, trading houses and oil companies\" interviewed, the vast majority (73 percent) thought increased speculation boosted prices beyond what supply and demand fundamentals dictated. Peregrine Financial Group analyst Phil Flynn argued that in terms of supply and demand fundamentals, oil markets were only the messenger. By April the CFTC began to \"rein in\" speculation in energy and commodity trading, especially oil, and proposed limiting the number of futures contracts financial players can hold at any one time.\"\n\nIn November 2014, the CFTC and the UK Financial Conduct Authority fined six banks for manipulating the foreign exchange market; JPMorgan, Chase, Citigroup, HSBC, RBS, and UBS paid roughly $1.2 billion to FCA and $1.5 billion, or about $300 million apiece to the CFTC.\n\nIn March 2014 the CFTC acknowledged it was considering the regulation of Bitcoin. The CFTC could treat Bitcoin transactions as swaps, futures, or spot transactions, otherwise Bitcoin would likely be a commodity under the CEA. In October, CFTC's Global Markets Advisory Committee discussed virtual currencies. Mark Wetjen wrote in an OpEd by the WSJ afterwards that [\"bitcoin] could play a fascinating role in the derivatives markets as well as financial services.\" and that a swap contract on Bitcoin that had been listed for trading by one registered trading platform was recently presented to CFTC.\n\nIn 2015, the CFTC ruled that bitcoin had been properly defined and was lawfully tradable under federal regulations. However, in view of the market volatility and magnitude of profitability, the CFTC noted several risks associated with trading virtual currencies. In 2017, the CFTC cited the US SEC’s warning against token sales and initial coin offerings (ICOs) that can “improperly entice investors with promises of high returns”.\n\nBased in Washington, D.C., the CFTC maintains regional offices in Chicago, New York and Kansas City, Missouri. The Commission consists of five Commissioners appointed by the President of the United States to serve staggered five-year terms. The President, with the consent of the United States Senate, designates one of the Commissioners to serve as Chairman. No more than three Commissioners at any one time may be from the same political party.\n\n\nThe Chairman's staff has responsibility for providing information about the Commission, interacting with other entities and for the preparation and dissemination of Commission documents. The Chairman's staff includes the Office of the Inspector General, which conducts audits of CFTC programs and operations, and the Office of International Affairs, the focal point for the Commission's global regulatory coordination efforts.\n\nThe Office of External Affairs (OEA) is the Commission's liaison with news media, producer and market user groups, educational groups, and the general public. OEA provides information about the regulatory mandate, the economic role of the futures markets, new market instruments, market regulation, enforcement actions, and customer protection initiatives.\n\nThe Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight oversees the registration, compliance, and business conduct standards of intermediaries, swap dealers and major swap participants.\n\nThe functions of the Division of Clearing and Intermediary Oversight include oversight of derivatives clearing organizations.\n\nThe Division of Market Oversight has regulatory responsibility for initial recognition and continuing oversight of trade execution facilities, including new registered futures exchanges and derivatives transaction execution facilities. The regulatory functions of the Division include, among other things, market surveillance, trade practice reviews and investigations, rule enforcement reviews, review of product-related and market-related rule amendments, and associated product and market-related studies.Director as of 2013 is Vincent A. McGonagle\n\nThe Division of Enforcement investigates and prosecutes alleged violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations. Violations may involve commodity futures or option trading on domestic commodity exchanges, or the improper marketing of commodity investments. The Division may, at the direction of the Commission, file complaints before the agency's administrative law judges or in the U.S. District Courts. Alleged criminal violations of the Commodity Exchange Act or violations of other Federal laws which involve commodity futures trading may be referred to the Justice Department for prosecution. The Division also provides expert help and technical assistance with case development and trials to U.S. Attorneys' Offices, other Federal and state regulators, and international authorities. The director of the Division of Enforcement until 2008 was Gregory Mocek, followed by David Meister until October 2013, followed byGretchen L. Lowe, and is Aitan Goelman.\n\nThe Office of the Chief Economist is an independent office with responsibility for providing expert economic advice to the Commission. Its functions include policy analysis, economic research, expert testimony, education, and training. As of 2014 the office is held by Sayee Srinivasan.\n\nThe Office of the General Counsel (OGC) is the Commission's legal advisor. OGC staff represents the Commission in appellate litigation and certain trial-level cases, including bankruptcy proceedings which involve futures industry professionals. As the Commission's legal advisor, OGC reviews all substantive regulatory, legislative, and administrative matters presented to it and advises the Commission on the application and interpretation of the Commodity Exchange Act and other administrative statutes. OGC also assists the Commission in performing its adjudicatory functions. Head as of April 2013 is Jonathan L. Marcus.\n\nThe Office of the Executive Director (OED) formulates and implements the management and administrative policies and functions of the agency. OED staff formulate the agency's budget, supervise the allocation and use of agency resources, promote management controls and financial integrity, and develop and maintain the agency's automated information systems. The Office of Proceedings, which is under the administrative direction of OED, provides an inexpensive and expeditious forum for handling customer complaints against people or firms registered with the National Futures Association (NFA) through its reparations program. The Office of Proceedings also hears and decides enforcement cases brought by the Commission.\n\nIt is responsible for recording and monitoring the trading of futures contracts on United States futures exchanges. The CFTC has the authority to fine, suspend, or sue the company or individual in a federal court in cases of misconduct, fraud, or if a rule breaking occurs.\n\nThe CFTC publishes weekly reports containing details of holdings for market-segments, which have 20 or more reportable participants. The reports are released every Friday (including data from the previous Tuesday) and contain data on open interest split by reportable and non-reportable open interest as well as commercial and non-commercial open interest. This type of report is referred to as the 'Commitments of Traders Report', COT-Report or simply COTR.\n\nThe CFTC is authorized to regulate commodity pools and commodity trading advisors. Many hedge funds operate as commodity pools. In an address to the Securities Industry Association in 2004, Sharon Brown-Hruska, acting director of the CFTC, said that 65 of the top 100 hedge funds in 2003 were commodity pools, and 50 out of the 100 largest hedge funds were CTAs in addition to being commodity pools.\n\nIn 2012, Christopher Ehrman, a SEC veteran was selected to run the new Office of the Whistleblower for the CFTC. In an interview published in \"The Wall Street Journal\", Mr. Ehrman is quoted: \"One is just understanding enforcement. I'm an enforcement guy and I did investigations and brought cases for a number of years. I understand what folks in enforcement are looking for. Whistleblower complaints have no intrinsic value. When they're just sitting here with me, they just don't mean anything. They're valuable to the enforcement division so that they can bring investigations.\" The website for the program claims that \"information that was first submitted to the CFTC after July 21, 2010 – the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act – is eligible for a whistleblower award\". And continues to explain \"The information, however, can be about conduct that happened at any time\".\n\nUnder the program, the CFTC will issue rewards to whistleblowers who provide original information that leads to CFTC enforcement actions or “related actions” with total civil penalties in excess of $1 million. A whistleblower may receive a reward of between 10-30 percent of the total sanctions imposed.\n\nThe CFTC announced its first award of approximately $240,000 to a whistleblower on May 20, 2014. The second award of approximately $290,000 was announced on September 29, 2015.\n\n\nUnlike the other four main financial regulators, the CFTC does not have self-funding. A transaction fee has been \"requested\" for several years but Congress has not taken any legislative action. During the government shut down in October 2013, SEC and Federal Reserve stayed open, but \"futures and most swaps markets were left with essentially no cop on the beat\".\n\nIn 2007, the CFTC's budget was $98 million and it had 437 full-time equivalent employees (FTEs). After 2008, funding increased by 80% to $205 million and 687 FTEs for fiscal year (FY) 2012, but was cut to $180.4 million and 682 FTEs for FY 2013. In 2013 CFTC's performance was severely affected by limited resources and had to delay cases. The current, FY 2014 funding of $215m did not keep up with CFTC's increasing swaps market oversight and regulation, equivalent to tens of trillions of dollars in formerly dark market trading, according to outgoing Commissioner Bart Chilton in his last speech. The Obama administration's latest budget proposal for FY 2015 requested $280m, which is $35m less than the request for the previous year, and would fund \"100 less employees than we need\" per Chilton, who called the budget \"woefully insufficient\" for CFTC's more than 40-fold increased purview.\nIn February 2014, Commissioner Scott D. O'Malia dissented from the FY 2014 spending plan saying that it did not allocate enough funding to new technology investments, but allocated too much to swap dealer oversight, duplicating the work of the self-regulatory National Futures Association. In March he dissented from the FY 2015 budget request stating CFTC \"makes an unrealistic request for new staff and funding in this budget request without a firm understanding of its mission priorities, specific goals, and corresponding personnel and technology needs.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Usually, this debt is considered senior to all other debt, equity, and any other securities issued by a company — violating any \"absolute priority rule\" by placing the new financing ahead of a company's existing debts for payment.\n\nDIP financing may be used to keep a business operating until it can be sold as a going concern, if this is likely to provide a greater return to creditors than the firm's closure and a liquidation of assets. It may also give a troubled company a new start, albeit under strict conditions. In this case, \"debtor in possession\" financing refers to debt incurred while in bankruptcy, and \"exit financing\" is debt incurred upon emerging from reorganisation under bankruptcy law.\n\nTwo notable examples are the government financing of Chrysler and General Motors during their respective 2009 bankruptcies.\n\nThe willingness of governments to allow lenders to place debtor-in-possession financing claims ahead of an insolvent company's existing debt varies; US bankruptcy law expressly allows this while French law had long treated the practice as \"soutien abusif\", requiring employees and state interests be paid first even if the end result was liquidation instead of corporate restructuring.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "322949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=322949", "title": "Decree", "text": "Decree\n\nA decree is a rule of law usually issued by a head of state (such as the president of a republic or a monarch), according to certain procedures (usually established in a constitution). It has the force of law. The particular term used for this concept may vary from country to country. The \"executive orders\" made by the President of the United States, for example, are decrees (although a decree is not exactly an order). In non-legal English usage, however, the term refers to any authoritarian decision. Documents or archives in the format of royal decrees or farming were issued by rulers.\n\nIn Belgium, a decree is a law of a community or regional parliament, e.g. the Flemish Parliament.\n\nThe word \"décret\", literally \"decree\", is an old legal usage in France and is used to refer to executive orders issued by the French President or Prime Minister. Any such order must not violate the French Constitution or Civil Code, and a party has the right to request an order be annulled in the French Council of State. Orders must be ratified by Parliament before they can be modified into legislative Acts. Special orders known as \"décret-loi\", literally \"decree-act\" or \"decree-law\", usually considered an illegal practice under the 3rd and 4th Republic, were finally abolished and replaced by the ordinances under the 1958 Constitution.\n\nExcept for the reserve powers of the President (as stated in Art. 16 of the 1958 Constitution, exercised only once so far), the executive can issue decrees in areas that the Constitution grants as the responsibility of Parliament only if a law authorizes it to do so. In other cases, orders are illegal and, should anyone sue for the order's annulment, it would be voided by the Council of State. There exists a procedure for the Prime Minister to issue ordinances in such areas, but this procedure requires Parliament's express consent (see Art 38 of the 1958 Constitution).\n\nOrders issued by the Prime Minister take two forms:\n\nSometimes, people refer to \"décrets en Conseil d'État\" improperly as \"décrets du Conseil d'État\". This would imply that it is the Council of State that takes the decree, whereas the power of decreeing is restricted to the president or prime minister; the role of the administrative sections of the Council is purely advisory.\n\nDecrees may be classified into:\n\nOnly the prime minister may issue regulatory or application decrees. Presidential decrees are generally nominations, or exceptional measures where law mandates a presidential decree, such as the dissolution of the French National Assembly and the calling of new legislative elections.\n\nDecrees are published in the \"Journal Officiel de la République Française\" or \"French Gazette\".\n\nA decree (Latin: \"decretum\") in the usage of the canon law of the Catholic Church has various meanings. Any papal Bull, Brief, or Motu Proprio is a decree inasmuch as these documents are legislative acts of the Pope. In this sense the term is quite ancient. The Roman Congregations were formerly empowered to issue decrees in matters which come under their particular jurisdiction, but were forbidden from continuing to do so under Pope Benedict XV in 1917. Each ecclesiastical province, and also each diocese may issue decrees in their periodical synods within their sphere of authority. \n\nCanon 29 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law offers a definition of general decrees:\nThe Holy See uses decrees from the pope such as papal bull, papal brief or motu proprio as legislative acts.\n\nAccording clause 77 of the Italian Constitution, \"The Government may not, without an enabling act from the Houses, issue decrees having the force of ordinary law.\nWhen in extraordinary cases of necessity and urgency the Government adopts provisional measures having the force of law, it must on the same day present said measures for confirmation to the Houses which, even if dissolved, shall be summoned especially for this purpose and shall convene within five days.\nThe decrees lose effect from their inception if they are not confirmed within sixty days from their publication. The Houses may however regulate by law legal relationships arising out of not confirmed decrees.\"\n\nThe effectiveness for sixty days produces the effects immediately, giving rights or expectations whose legal basis was in fact precarious, especially when the conversion law never intervened.\n\nIn Portugal, there are several types of decrees (, singular ) issued by the various bodies of sovereignty or by the bodies of self-government of autonomous regions.\n\nCurrently, there are the following types of decrees:\n\nAccording to the article 110 of the constitution, the supreme leader delineates the general policies of the Islamic Republic.\n\nAfter the Russian Revolution, a government proclamation of wide meaning was called a \"decree\" (Russian: декрет, dekret); more specific proclamations were called \"ukaz\". Both terms are usually translated as 'decree'.\n\nAccording to the Russian Federation's 1993 constitution, an \"Ukaz\" is a Presidential decree. Such ukazes have the power of laws, but may not alter the Russian constitution or the regulations of existing laws, and may be superseded by laws passed by the Federal Assembly.\n\nThe Government of Russia can also issue decrees formally called Decisions (Постановления) or Orders (Распоряжения) and may not contradict the constitution/laws or presidential decrees.\n\nRoyal decrees are the source of law in Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn Spain, decrees come in a number of forms:\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Orders-in-Council are either primary legislation deriving their authority from the Royal Prerogative, promulgated by the Privy Council in the name of the Monarch; or secondary legislation, promulgated by a Minister of the Crown using authority granted by an Act of Parliament or other primary legislation. Both are subject to judicial review, the former with some exceptions.\n\nIn US legal usage, during the 19th and early 20th centuries, a decree was an order of a court of equity determining the rights of the parties to a suit, according to equity and good conscience. Since the 1938 procedural merger of law and equity in the federal courts under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the term \"judgment\" (the parallel term in common law) has generally replaced \"decree\". This is now true also in most state courts. The term \"decree\" has had a similar usage in admiralty, probate, and divorce law.\n\nA decree is often a final determination, but there are also interlocutory decrees. A \"final decree\" fully and finally disposes of the whole litigation, determining all questions raised by the case, and it leaves nothing that requires further judicial action; it is also appealable. An \"interlocutory decree\" is a provisional or preliminary decree that is not final and does not fully determine the suit, so that some further proceedings are required before entry of a final decree. It is usually not appealable, although preliminary injunctions by federal courts are appealable even though interlocutory.\n\nExecutive orders, which are instructions from the President to the executive branch of government, are decrees in the general sense in that they have the force of law, although they cannot override statute law or the Constitution and are subject to judicial review.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, certain types of court orders by judges are referred to as decrees, e.g. a divorce decree.\n\n\n\n\"All external sites in French unless otherwise noted.\"\n\n"}

In Stalinist ideology and practice, deviationism is an expressed belief which does not accord with official party doctrine for the time and area. Accusations of deviationism often led to purges. Forms of deviationism included revisionism, dogmatism, bourgeois nationalism, and rootless cosmopolitanism.\n\nMao Zedong in a 1953 speech referred to both \"left\" and \"right\" deviationists. Years later, in 1976, the so-called Gang of Four would strike out against \"rightist deviationism\" in China.\n\nLeon Trotsky believed that Lenin's pre-1917 idea of the \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" needed to be re-worded to emphasize the importance of the proletariat's leadership in such an alliance, because the peasantry were dialectically less capable of leadership. In order to finish a socialist revolution, the revolution would have to be world-wide. This is in sharp contrast to Joseph Stalin's idea of \"socialism in one country;\" Trotsky felt that if a socialist nation-state was isolated, it would soon be destroyed by outside imperialist forces. Trotsky emphasized the importance of soviets (independent councils of workers) and the idea that a communist society will be a \"workers' democracy.\"\n\nAccording to Trotskyist doctrine, the Soviet Union became a \"degenerated workers state\" and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) as \"bureaucratic centralist.\" Trotskyites considered the Soviet degenerated workers state still as \"revolutionary workers' state\" or \"proletarian dictatorship.\" As such, the Soviet state was \"historically progressive\" in relation to \"reactionary capitalism.\" Hence it was the duty of revolutionists in all nations, even if they were opponents of Stalin and his regime, to defend the Soviet Union against any \"imperialist\" state, including their own fatherland. Another revolution was necessary however to unseat the Stalinists, who would destroy the workers state until it became fully capitalist.\n\nBefore World War II the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) had always received directives and funds from the Soviet Union via courier. Moscow's most effective control had been through Comintern representatives.\n\nEarl Browder, CPUSA leader, accepted the Hitler-Stalin pact of August 1939 without hesitation. Comintern did find it necessary to fine-tune the CPUSA’s stance. Immediately after the Pact, Georgi Dimitrov, chief of the Comintern, sent a ciphered message to Browder explaining that the CPUSA’s line supporting the Pact was not fully correct because while it broke with President Franklin Roosevelt’s policy of supporting Britain, France, and Lend-Lease aid, it failed to take the additional step of breaking with FDR’s domestic policies as well. Browder and the CPUSA immediately made the required changes in its policies, and in 1940 the CPUSA did its best to oppose FDR’s reelection to the presidency.\n\nWorld War II reduced the direct organization ties of CPUSA to Comintern and drastically reduced the volume of communications. Postal communications was less reliable and often delayed and subject to government inspection. International cable traffic was routinely reviewed by war-time security officials. Travel to the USSR became increasingly difficult. In 1940 the Voorhis Act was passed imposing regulatory requirements on domestic American organizations with foreign government ties. To avoid the Voorhis Act, in November 1940, CPUSA, with Comintern permission, severed its official membership in the Communist International, and the last officially designated CPUSA representative in Moscow left in 1941.\n\nBrowder developed the doctrine of indefinite collaboration with capitalism and the Harry Bridges doctrine of postwar extension of the no-strike pledge.\n\nThe wartime coalition gave Browder the vision of an Americanized Communist Party working with other American parties to solve the urgent questions facing the nation. To this end he began a policy of naturalizing the party, relaxing its discipline, and moderating its sectarianism. He transformed the wartime tactic of national unity into a postwar strategy and argued the possibility that progressive capitalism, to save itself, would embark on policies favorable to the workers at home and to the Soviet Union abroad.\n\nIn April 1945, however, Jacques Duclos of the French Communist Party, formerly high in the Comintern, published a repudiation of Browderism.\nPublication of the attack by the \"New York World-Telegram\" panicked the CPUSA into drastic action against Browder: they unceremoniously expelled him in February 1946.\n\nTitoism is a form of Leninism based on the regime of Marshal Josip Broz Tito post-World War II in Yugoslavia. While formerly heading a Comintern liberation movement, after the war Tito broke with Moscow and insisted Yugoslavia was to be non-aligned with neither NATO nor the Warsaw Pact. Tito called for \"national unity\" and \"self-management\" which enabled Yugoslavia to form relationships independent of the superpowers with other governments during the Cold War.\n\nMaoism mixes orthodox Marxism–Leninism with populism. Named after its originator Mao Zedong, the ideology relies on militant, insurrectionary and populist strategies in movement organizing (People’s Wars, Cultural Revolution, Peasant Uprising, etc.). Like Stalin, Mao’s China relied on Five-Year Plans, the best-known of which was the Great Leap Forward. \n\nThis view of the CCP contrasted sharply with the view of Moscow whose ideology was in line with orthodoxy of historical materialism of Marxism's early thinkers, that socialist societies must be preceded by capitalist societies, which would provide the material basis for a socialist economy. This orthodox theory of Marxism relied heavily on a dialectical \"force of history\" that would inevitably bring about the \"objective conditions\" necessary for a proletarian revolution to succeed. Any ideological concepts running counter to this thesis, that is, any formulations which called for skipping stages of historic development were considered in the orthodox view as adventuristic and counter revolutionary.\n\nMaoist deviationism inspired students and other young people who looked to the Chinese Red Guards as a model of activism. While some of these young activists were drawn to the Progressive Labor Party (PLP), the full flowering of American Maoism would not come until the proliferation of new groups such as the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), Weather Underground (WUO), Black Panthers (BPP) and the Communist Party (Marxist–Leninist) (CP-ML) after 1969.\n\nThe term has also been used with respect to other ideologies. In 2002 the Religious Affairs Minister of Brunei in Southeast Asia used the same term to describe what he considered to be incorrect, presumably non-mainstream Islamic teachings.\n"}
{"id": "20217474", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20217474", "title": "Duopoly (broadcasting)", "text": "Duopoly (broadcasting)\n\nA duopoly (or twinstick, referring to \"stick\" as jargon for a radio tower) is a situation in television and radio broadcasting in which two or more stations in the same city or community share common ownership.\n\nIn the United States, the practice of duopolies has been frowned upon when using public airwaves, on the premise that it gives too much influence to one company. However, rules governing radio stations are less restrictive than those for television, allowing as many as six radio stations under common ownership in the largest U.S. media markets. Ownership of television stations with overlapping coverage areas was normally not allowed in the United States prior to 2002, even those that were not duopolies under the present legal definition, by way of being located in separate albeit adjacent markets; this required broadcasters to apply for crossownership waivers in some cases to retain full-power stations based in adjacent markets. Non-commercial educational broadcasters, mainly those that were members of the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), were the only licensees allowed to sign-on or acquire a second television station that did not repeat the parent station's signal in the same market where they already owned a station (some of these acquired stations were originally licensed as commercial outlets).\n\nOn August 5, 1999, the Federal Communications Commission voted 4-1 to allow common ownership of two television stations within a single market by one company, so long as eight unique station owners remain in the market once the duopoly is formed, and the four highest-rated stations (based on local monthly viewership reports for the market) remain under separate ownership. The FCC only requires the severance of an existing duopoly in which a once lower-rated station falls within the ratings criteria that prohibits such ownership over time if an ownership transaction is under review (such as a piecemeal or group sale of stations, or necessary license transfers during an ownership transaction involving the stations' existing owner); a company is required to sell one of the stations in the duopoly to another licensee if it is no longer compliant with one or both provisions.\n\nOnce a duopoly is formed, the acquiring company takes over the operations of its new property. The operations of the two stations are usually consolidated into one facility, depending on the size and age of the facility chosen to house their operations. Since the stations involved in the duopoly are not restricted by FCC law from consolidating their operations, duplicative jobs at one of the stations are often terminated as the consolidation takes effect.\n\nNews departments are also often consolidated into a singular operation, with anchoring and reporting staffs from the respective stations often being folded into one unit, subject to hiring determinations made by management; anchors and reporters are usually shared between the two stations, though in some cases, certain anchors may be employed to appear only on each station's own newscasts. In some cases (like with WHDH and WLVI in Boston, Massachusetts, when the former's owner Sunbeam Television formed a duopoly with WLVI after purchasing the station from Tribune Broadcasting in 2006), the junior partner's news department is shut down completely, with the senior partner subsequently taking over production of its news content using only their existing staff. In many cases, news programming on a junior partner is structured to avoid direct competition with a senior partner affiliate of either ABC, NBC or CBS (one notable exception involves WTTV and WXIN in Indianapolis, which carry competing morning and evening newscasts as Tribune Broadcasting opted to launch a separate slate of newscasts for WTTV when it became a CBS affiliate in January 2015, rather than shift those seen on sister Fox affiliate WXIN to the station; WXIN and WTTV largely maintain their own anchors, but share a news department and most reporting staff). This situation is uncommon in duopolies involving only Big Three affiliates, as stations affiliated with those networks are more inclined to carry newscasts in overlapping time periods in order to fulfill local programming requirements included in affiliation agreements.\n\nCertain syndicated programs are also shared between the stations, in the form of either same-day repeat airings of programs seen on the one which holds primary rights or separated runs of programs that air on each station, although each station maintains separate syndication inventories as well. The junior partner, unless it is affiliated with a major network, may also be used to carry network (and occasionally, first-run syndicated) programs that the senior partner is unable to broadcast because of long-form breaking news or severe weather coverage or a locally produced special airing in a scheduled program's normal timeslot, or in the case of certain non-prime time network programs, because the senior partner chooses not to carry it on its regular schedule to carry other scheduled programming.\n\nAlthough the FCC bars common ownership of any of the four major broadcast networks (ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox), it does not prohibit duopolies involving stations affiliated individually with any two of them, unless both are among the four highest-rated in the market at the time of a sale. As such, several Big Four duopolies exist based on certain market conditions that originally allowed them to be formed under the criteria (such as a company having acquired one of the major network stations as a low-rated affiliate of a smaller network prior to an affiliation switch or the ratings of a non-English station placing among the top four over a Big Four network affiliate). While most duopolies are made up of a senior partner that is affiliated with one of the four major networks and an affiliate of a minor network (such as The CW and MyNetworkTV) or an independent station as the junior partner, those in which both stations are major network affiliates typically involve a Fox station (which serves as the junior partner in all but a few instances) and an ABC, CBS or NBC affiliate, with some limited arrangements where two Big Three affiliates are jointly owned or managed.\n\nOne of the few markets where two major network duopolies exist in some form is Jacksonville, Florida, where two companies once owned the licenses of the Big Four stations they respectively controlled. In 2000, the Gannett Company, owner of NBC affiliate WTLV, purchased ABC affiliate WJXX, which had struggled in the local ratings since its sign-on in February 1997 (when it took the ABC affiliation from WJKS through a group affiliation deal with the Allbritton Communications Company) due to its status as a relatively new station and issues with signal interference from PBS station WJCT on its Mediacom cable channel slot. The following year, Clear Channel Communications created a legal duopoly involving its existing Fox affiliate WAWS (now WFOX-TV) and WTEV-TV (now WJAX-TV), a UPN affiliate that it had been managing under a local marketing agreement since 1994; WTEV's viewership gradually rose after it became a CBS affiliate in July 2002, putting it in the top four threshold with WAWS, resulting in Newport Television – upon purchasing the Clear Channel television group in 2007 – restructuring the operation as a virtual duopoly by selling WTEV to shell licensee High Plains Broadcasting (WFOX and WJAX are now respectively owned by the Cox Media Group and Bayshore Television, LLC, but remain under common management though an LMA in which WJAX is the junior partner).\n\nThe use of digital subchannels has been termed an \"instant duopoly,\" because of the ease by which a single digital station can deliver multiple channels of programming from different networks at the same time. One station can carry four or more standard definition digital channels; multiple high definition feeds typically require too large a bitrate size to be carried on different subchannels of the same station simultaneously without loss of image quality.\n\nSome broadcasting companies have used loopholes to establish duopolies in smaller markets by way of a local marketing agreement, shared services agreement or joint sales agreement; where a station effectively brokers its entire airtime to the owner of another station in the market, which becomes responsible for handling its programming and advertising sales – and in effect, operations. These are termed as \"virtual duopolies\" as the station's license is held by one company, while its operations are handled by another. Through a 2014 FCC ruling, joint sales agreements in which the senior partner sells a minimum of 15% of the advertising time for its junior partner are counted toward ownership caps.\n\nSome larger broadcasting companies have controversially built business models around the practice, by funding the acquisition of stations by what are effectively shill companies or shell corporations; for example, Sinclair Broadcast Group operates the stations of Cunningham Broadcasting and Deerfield Media under LMAs or SSAs. Nearly all of Cunningham's stock is held by trusts in the name of Sinclair's founders and owners, the Smith family. Similarly, Nexstar Media Group funds the purchase of stations by Mission Broadcasting, which forms duopolies with their stations through shared services agreements with a Nexstar station. In some cases, the senior partner may acquire a station's physical assets and intellectual property (such as the station's facilities and programming rights), but spin off the license itself to a shell corporation and enter into an agreement to operate the station, making it the \"de facto\" owner, but not the legal owner. Following the purchase, the station's operations and programming are often merged into that of its new parent station. Similarly, a company that acquires an existing legal duopoly that is no longer complies with FCC rules on duopoly ownership may spin off the junior partner station's license to a shell, rather than sell one of the stations to a licensee that would also assume operational responsibilities, allowing the restructured duopoly to remain under common operation through a resulting management agreement.\n\nIn some cases, the use of an adjacent-market city of license has been used on a secondary station to avoid a limit on the number of stations controlled by the same broadcaster in the same market. Occasionally, those arrangements cross international borders. For instance, radio station WLYK in Cape Vincent, New York in the United States is operated from the Canadian studios of Kingston, Ontario's CIKR-FM, a broadcaster already at the two-station limit in its own market, under an LMA. Broadcasters such as Entravision have often entered into local marketing agreements with Mexican border stations (such as Tecate's XHDTV-TDT for content directed at San Diego).\n\nIt is also possible to obtain a \"failing station waiver,\" which can exempt a broadcaster from some portion of the existing restrictions on common ownership in order to acquire and operate a station which otherwise would be economically non-viable or would be forced to cease operations.\n\nRequests for failing station waivers have historically met with variable reception; in general, a prospective buyer is on the same wavelength with the FCC on failing-station policies if it can demonstrate to the Commission that:\n\nWaivers under these criteria were granted to sell WASV-TV in Asheville to Media General, owner of CBS affiliate WSPA-TV in that market, and KWBA in Tucson to the Journal Broadcast Group, owner of that market's ABC affiliate KGUN-TV. A similar waiver was refused to KNIN-TV in Boise as the station, a CW affiliate at the time the waiver application was filed, appeared to have reasonable prospects of financial break-even without a takeover by Journal-owned ABC affiliate KIVI-TV; that decision was subsequently appealed, with the waiver being granted upon further review (Journal Broadcast Group would eventually be required to sell KNIN in 2014, as the station's financial condition improved enough in its post-2011 existence as a Fox affiliate to make it unsuitable for the E. W. Scripps Company – which was in the process of purchasing Journal's broadcasting unit in a deal in which Journal simultaneously merged with Scripps' publishing unit – to acquire it under a renewed waiver, in addition to the fact that it could not acquire it legally as the market had fewer than eight unique owners).\n\nLow-power and Class A television stations are not subject to ownership caps in the United States, as their broadcast signals do not reach as many homes as full-power stations. In areas with high cable television penetration, this distinction is essentially meaningless. LPTV stations were also exempt from digital television transition requirements imposed on full-service broadcasters upon the June 2009 digital conversion.\n\nAs such, low-power stations can also be formed to create duopolies; for instance, Weigel Broadcasting maintains triopolies in three markets surrounding the southern part of Lake Michigan (Chicago, Illinois; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and South Bend, Indiana) using a combination of full-power and low-power television stations. In Chicago, it maintains one full-power signal (independent station WCIU-TV) and two low-power stations (WWME-CD and WMEU-CA, the flagship stations of the Me-TV digital subchannel network). In Milwaukee, Weigel has two full-power stations (CBS affiliate WDJT-TV and full-power independent station WMLW-TV) and two low-power stations (Me-TV station WBME-CD and Telemundo affiliate WYTU-LD, though the latter station uses a subchannel of WMLW as its main conduit for cable carriage). Weigel also takes advantage of digital subchannel broadcasting heavily and airs This TV in Milwaukee and South Bend, and Bounce TV in Chicago and Milwaukee; the company had also previously executed time share agreements on other subchannels with ethnic broadcasters, and in Milwaukee, a local real estate agency to air programming.\n\nA similar situation exists in Lima, Ohio, where Block Communications controls a quadropoly of stations owned by itself (WLIO, a full-powered NBC affiliate which also carries Fox and MyNetworkTV on a digital subchannel) and low-power stations owned by West Central Ohio Broadcasting, Inc. (which owns ABC affiliate WLQP-LP/WOHL-CD, and CBS affiliate WLMO-LP) under an LMA. One of the latter company's heads, Allan J. Block, is the chairman of Block Communications. The group is the sole over-air provider of secular network television programming in the Lima market, though area cable systems also carry out-of-market affiliates from Toledo, Columbus and Dayton.\n\nIn radio, Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) policy generally allows broadcasters to operate no more than three radio stations in any given market, of which no more than two may be on the same radio band — that is, a company may own two AM stations and an FM station, or two FM stations and an AM station, but may not own three AMs or three FMs. However, in major metropolitan markets where a large number of radio stations are already broadcasting, the limit is increased to four stations with a maximum of two on each band. A company may also exceed these limits if it owns stations broadcasting in both English and French; for instance, in the Montreal media market, Bell Media Radio owns six radio stations, of which two operate in French and four in English.\n\nOfficially, CRTC policy mandates that a broadcaster may only own one television station in a particular language in any given market. However, there are two types of exemptions which may be granted:\n\nThe policy does not prevent companies from owning multiple stations in a market provided that the stations broadcast in different languages. In recent years, this has been interpreted as meaning that a single company may own both an English-language station and one or more multicultural stations with some English-language content, which in itself may be considered a form of \"exemption\". CBC/Radio-Canada owned-and-operated stations (O&Os) are also often deployed in pairs in major cities on both television and radio, separated only by language. In addition, the policy is not interpreted as preventing a single company from owning both a \"commercial\" general-interest station and an educational station in the same market, even if the latter airs advertising, as with Access in Alberta.\n\nAlthough the small and large market exemptions have a financial criterion in common, there are notable differences between the two. A small market twinstick may involve major network affiliates licensed to the same community, and is not obligated to provide distinct local news programming on the two stations, while in a large market the stations must be licensed to serve different communities or different programming niches, and \"cannot\" merge their news programming into a single operation. Small market twinsticks commonly share their branding across both stations, while twinsticks in large markets generally do not. As well, while small market twinsticks generally involve private affiliates, major market twinsticks are virtually always owned-and-operated stations of their associated networks or systems.\n\nIn a few isolated cases, the CRTC has permitted \"triple-sticks\", or triopolies, where a single broadcaster operates \"three\" stations in a market. These are only possible under unusual circumstances which are discussed as they arise below.\n\nTwinsticks were first allowed in 1967, as a way to help expand CTV service to smaller markets. In the original twinstick model, the second station was a rebroadcaster of a CTV station in a larger market, to which the small market's existing CBC affiliate would be granted the advertising sales rights.\n\nAs the company's advertising revenue grew, the CTV transmitter would eventually become an originating station in its own right, and in theory would eventually be sold to another broadcaster. However, in many cases the subsequent sale never happened, as the community's economic growth failed to lend itself to competition between multiple television broadcasters. In other markets where the CRTC had licensed competing broadcasters, such as Northern Ontario, twinstick mergers were subsequently allowed to permit the survival of both television stations after similar economic difficulties were encountered.\n\nWith the cross-national consolidation of media ownership, nearly all of the original twinstick stations no longer share ownership with their former twin stations. However, the second type of twinstick, involving media consolidation in larger markets, began to arise in the 1990s.\n\nUp until February 2010, twinsticks of this type outside of Quebec involved CTV and CBC Television affiliates. Currently both small-market twinsticks in English Canada consist of Global and CTV affiliates.\n\nWithin Quebec, twinsticks may consist of any combination of Ici Radio-Canada Télé, TVA and V affiliates:\n\nFrom 1997 to 2002, CTV directly owned several CBC twinstick stations that it had inherited from Baton Broadcasting (CKNC, CHNB, CJIC and CFCL in Northern Ontario, which were part of the MCTV system, and CKBI and CKOS in Saskatchewan); these were sold to the CBC in 2002.\n\nOne \"triple-stick\" also exists, in which a single company, Télé Inter-Rives, operates all three licensed stations in Rivière-du-Loup: CKRT, CIMT and CFTF. An unofficial triple-stick also exists in the Rouyn-Noranda area, as RNC Media, the licensed owner of that city's twinstick, also operates CFVS, the sole station licensed to the nearby city of Val-d'Or; in actual practice, all three stations serve both cities. These unusual situations arise because of the unique circumstances of francophone television stations in Quebec: with virtually no sources for syndicated programming, the stations are effectively constrained to network programming at all times, and both TVA and Radio-Canada maintain direct editorial control of local newscasts on all of their affiliates – meaning that despite being owned by a single company, the stations are still able to meet the guiding principles behind the CRTC's policies on media ownership.\n\nAs noted above, historically, twinstick operations were locally owned. With the cross-national consolidation of media ownership in Canada, however, most twinstick operations are now owned by major media conglomerates. The Thunder Bay Television stations (CHFD/CKPR) are the sole remaining locally owned twinstick anywhere in English Canada. The aforementioned Télé Inter-Rives is similarly unique in Quebec, although it is itself \"partially\" owned by Quebecor.\n\nUntil August 2008, Cogeco owned three twinsticks in Quebec: CKTV and CFRS in Saguenay, CKSH and CFKS in Sherbrooke and CKTM and CFKM in Trois-Rivières. These twinsticks were dissolved when Radio-Canada decided to acquire its former affiliates (CKTV, CKSH and CKTM), while the V affiliates (CFRS, CFKS and CFKM) were acquired by Remstar Corporation, the new owner of V (then known as TQS).\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the CRTC also began to allow private companies operating in large markets to acquire smaller stations. In all such cases, the twinsticks are permitted because a diversity of broadcast voices already exists in the market, and the stations are normally licensed to serve different communities in the metropolitan market or different programming niches. The stations must also be operated independently of each other, although they are permitted to cross-promote each other's programming. They may also air a very limited amount of common programming, although in practice this privilege is rarely used.\n\nCurrently, Bell Media operates twinsticks in three major markets, using the CTV and CTV Two brands:\n\nIn addition to these \"true\" twinsticks, in some areas, Bell Media has taken a twinstick-type approach with two stations deemed to be in \"adjacent\" media markets, but which in practice serve both markets. For example, Bell operates both CTV station CKCO-DT in Kitchener, Ontario and CTV Two station CFPL-DT in London, about away. Both have been carried on the VHF band of basic cable throughout much of southwestern Ontario for several decades. Hence, presumably as a result of this duplicated coverage, their current owner has elected to continue airing distinct programming on both stations (on the other hand, Kitchener is also about 100 km from Toronto; nevertheless both CKCO and Toronto's CFTO operate as CTV stations).\n\nFinally, in some markets, Bell Media operates both a local over-the-air CTV station, and a provincial or regional cable channel that broadcasts CTV Two programming. In Alberta, CTV stations CFCN in Calgary and CFRN in Edmonton co-exist with CTV Two Alberta, which is officially licensed as the provincial educational broadcaster and is therefore technically exempt from the CRTC's common ownership policy (prior to September 2011, CTV Two Alberta also operated over-the-air transmitters in Calgary and Edmonton). In the Maritime Provinces, Bell Media operates both the over-the-air CTV Atlantic group of stations and the cable-only CTV Two Atlantic, which have been jointly owned (under various parent companies) since the latter's launch in 1983.\n\nCanwest operated the CIII/CHCH twinstick in Toronto-Hamilton and the CHAN/CHEK twinstick in Vancouver-Victoria until 2009, under the Global and E! brands. These two sets of twinsticks were separated as a result of E!'s demise in August 2009, with Canwest retaining the Global O&Os (CIII and CHAN) and selling off the E! stations (CHCH and CHEK). Additionally, Canwest previously owned the now-defunct CHCA in Red Deer, which was available on cable and via rebroadcast transmitters in both Calgary and Edmonton, where Canwest respectively already owned CICT and CITV. This was not considered a true twinstick as CHCA was not based in the larger markets, and did not have permission to solicit local advertising in those markets. It did, however, have simultaneous substitution rights.\n\nCHUM Television operated the CITY/CKVR twinstick in Toronto-Barrie and the CKVU/CIVI twinstick in Vancouver-Victoria under the Citytv and A-Channel brands prior to its acquisition by CTVglobemedia in 2006. Following this acquisition, Rogers Media briefly held twinsticks in Vancouver (CKVU and CHNU) and Winnipeg (CHMI and CIIT), formed from its newly acquired Citytv stations and its Omni-branded religious stations; these two sets of twinsticks were dissolved in 2008 following the sales of CHNU and CIIT to S-VOX.\n\nUnlike the situation in smaller markets, this type of \"consolidation\" twinstick had been increasingly common up to the late 2000s, concurrently with the rise of secondary television systems (such as CH/E! and A-Channel) launched by their parent companies to complement their primary networks or systems (such as Global and Citytv). This trend was partially reversed in 2009 with the demise of E! and the subsequent dissolution of the Global/E! twinsticks.\n\nIn many major markets, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation operates both CBC Television (English) and Ici Radio-Canada Télé (French) stations, as listed below. Prior to the CBC decommissioning all of its television rebroadcasters in 2012, both networks were available over-the-air in numerous other markets not listed below, but one or both of the transmitters was a rebroadcaster of a station originating in a different city; these were not usually considered true twinsticks. Nevertheless, both networks continue to be available as part of the basic programming tier on all cable and satellite providers nationwide.\n\nIn Toronto, Edmonton and Calgary, Rogers Media's acquisition of the Citytv system put those stations in twinsticks with the multilingual Omni Television stations. In Toronto, Omni Television has its own twinstick, giving the company a nominal \"triple-stick\" in that market. The two Omni stations in Toronto each serve different segments of the market's multicultural audience, and thus are \"also\" permitted under the language exemption.\n\nIn Montreal, Canwest owned both Global station CKMI and multicultural station CJNT until August 2009, when the latter was sold to Channel Zero.\n\nCTV was formerly a part-owner of the francophone V network (formerly TQS) in Quebec, meaning that V's owned-and-operated CFJP in Montreal was a partial twinstick with CTV's CFCF for most of the 2000s. CFCF was, in fact, the original \"owner\" of TQS, meaning that the stations were once a true twinstick under the language exemption, although the two stations went through very different sequences of ownership changes after 1995.\n\nNBCUniversal formerly owned three full-power stations in Los Angeles, NBC owned-and-operated station KNBC, Telemundo O&O KVEA and Spanish language independent station KWHY-TV, before selling KWHY to the Meruelo Group in January 2011. The FCC allows common ownership of three full-power television stations if there are 18 stations that are licensed within the market; as such, Los Angeles and San Francisco are the only two U.S. markets which can legally have a true full-power triopoly.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission otherwise only permits common ownership of three full-power television stations within one market if the tertiary station is licensed under a satellite station waiver (the FCC constitutes a full-power station that is licensed as a satellite as the same entity as its parent station, and therefore does not count them toward market ownership caps). A unique instance exists in Austin, Texas, involving the \"de facto\" triopoly of NBC affiliate KXAN-TV, CW affiliate KNVA and MyNetworkTV affiliate KBVO, the latter of which signed on in 1991 as a Llano-based satellite of KXAN to serve western portions of the market where reception of that station's UHF signal was impaired by the hilly terrain within the area. Even though KBVO was converted into a separately programmed station in October 2009 (and therefore no longer acts as a KXAN repeater, even by way of a subchannel), the FCC granted Media General permission to acquire its license under an existing satellite waiver during that company's merger with LIN Media in 2014 (without the waiver, Media General/LIN would have been forced to sell either KBVO or KNVA, which would not have been viable in any event, since there are not enough unique full-power station owners in the Austin market to permit a second legal duopoly with an owner of one of the market's three English language major network affiliates and neither would have likely had long-term financial survivability as a standalone station).\n\nIn addition, the FCC permits common ownership of three television stations if there are low-powered stations that are involved.\n\nIn 2013, through its acquisition of stations from Newport Television, Nexstar and Mission Broadcasting formed a full-power virtual quadropoly made up of two legal duopolies in Little Rock, Arkansas, consisting of NBC affiliate KARK-TV and MyNetworkTV affiliate KARZ-TV (which Nexstar already owned), and Fox affiliate KLRT-TV and CW affiliate KASN (another existing duopoly that was acquired by Mission). Through the resulting local marketing agreement with Nexstar, the operations of KLRT and KASN were consolidated into KARK/KARZ's facilities; 30 employees were laid off as part of the consolidation. A similar virtual quadropoly in the Mobile, Alabama-Pensacola, Florida market was formed through another acquisition from Newport, this time by Sinclair, consisting of Pensacola-based ABC affiliate WEAR-TV and MyNetworkTV affiliate WFGX (which were both already owned by Sinclair and licensed to the beach community of Fort Walton Beach), and Mobile-based NBC affiliate WPMI and Pensacola-licensed independent station WJTC (owned by Deerfield, and operated by Sinclair under a local marketing agreement). Unlike the quadropoly in Little Rock, Sinclair has not consolidated all four stations into one facility and each duopoly maintains their own studios in different parts of the market (WEAR/WFGX on the Florida side, WPMI/WJTC on the Alabama side). Similarly structured virtual triopolies (many of which are run by Nexstar and Sinclair) also exist in a few markets, in which either an existing owner-operator of a legal duopoly also manages a tertiary station owned by a separate if indirectly related licensee, or owns-operates one station and runs two others that are owned by different licensees.\n\nIn Canada, at least one community (Rivière-du-Loup, Quebec) has all three of its local French language stations – CKRT-DT, CIMT-DT and CFTF-DT – under common ownership, however such levels of common ownership are for the most part strongly discouraged by the CRTC unless the stations serve remote communities or separately carry programming in different languages (such as Rogers Media's aforementioned triopoly in Toronto, consisting of the English-language CITY-DT and multicultural stations CFMT-DT and CJMT-DT). \n\nIn Mexico, media concentration is endemic and it is not uncommon for as many as four stations to be operated by one entity. Televisa owns four Mexico City stations (XEW, XHTV, XHGC and XEQ) while Azteca, Mexico's second-largest broadcaster, owns three (XHIMT, XHDF and XHTVM). These stations, in turn, feed large numbers of full-power affiliates. The largest Mexican network is the Televisa-owned Canal de las Estrellas, which feeds its programming to more than 100 stations nationwide.\n\n"}

{"id": "7950295", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7950295", "title": "Financial assistance (share purchase)", "text": "Financial assistance (share purchase)\n\nFinancial assistance in law refers to assistance given by a company for the purchase of its own shares or the shares of its holding companies. In many jurisdictions such assistance is prohibited or restricted by law. For example all EU member states are required to restrict financial assistance by public companies up to the limit of the company's distributable reserves, although some members go further, for example, Belgium, Bulgaria, France, and The Netherlands restrict financial assistance by all companies. Where such assistance is given in breach of applicable law it will render the relevant transaction void and may constitute a criminal offence. \n\nThe assistance can be of a variety of different types. The most common type of assistance is a financial guarantee for a loan and/or third party security to allow a borrower to borrow money to buy shares which is routinely given (to the extent legally possible) after a leveraged buyout in support of the new owner's acquisition debt. It would also normally include a gift or loan from the company or any other act which reduces the net assets of the company to a material extent where this is done for the purpose of the acquisition of shares in itself or its parent.\n\nThe rationale for such laws is purely economic; it is based upon the premise that if a company supports the purchase of its own shares, it causes a \"de facto\" diminution in the company's value in the hands of other shareholders (who are assumed to continue their ownership following the transaction). Conflicting concerns have also been expressed, namely that such financial assistance artificially inflates a share's price above its market level.\n\nAlthough the authorities are unclear, it seems that financial assistance may also have been a crime under the English common law prior to its codification by statute. If that is correct, then laws against financial assistance may be much more prevalent than is normally assumed, and would also apply in many of the English speaking Commonwealth countries.\n\nLaws against financial assistance are sometimes controversial because of the difficulties they can cause in the context of a leveraged buyout, and some jurisdictions which have enacted them have later repealed them. Some jurisdictions provide for so-called \"whitewash\" procedures, whereby the shareholders can authorise transactions that would otherwise be void for financial assistance. Most jurisdictions which prohibit financial assistance permit the company to purchase its own shares and hold them in treasury, and the company can then issue them again on terms that would have been prohibited if they had sought to provide financial assistance in an equivalent manner for a third party purchase.\n"}
{"id": "952401", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=952401", "title": "Forum shopping", "text": "Forum shopping\n\nForum shopping is a colloquial term for the practice of litigants having their legal case heard in the court thought most likely to provide a favorable judgment. Some jurisdictions have, for example, become known as \"plaintiff-friendly\" and so have attracted litigation even when there is little or no connection between the legal issues and the jurisdiction in which they are to be litigated. In reality, every litigant who files a lawsuit engages in forum shopping when he chooses a legal jurisdiction to file suit. \n\nExamples include the attraction of foreign litigants to the United States due to its expansive acceptance of personal jurisdiction and favorable litigation climate, and the United Kingdom for its stricter defamation laws and generous divorce settlements.\n\nThe term has become adopted in a wider context for the activity of repeatedly seeking a venue or willing listener for a concern, complaint or action, until one is found.\n\nWhen a case is filed before a court, the court decides whether it has personal and subject matter jurisdiction, and if so, whether it is the most appropriate forum or venue. Under the doctrine of \"forum non conveniens\", Latin for \"inappropriate forum\", a judge has a discretion to transfer a case if the court selected is not the most convenient one. If the courts in two states would accept civil jurisdiction, the plaintiff must be able to show that justice requires the trial to take place in the forum suggested by the plaintiff.\n\nThe plaintiff might have selected one forum on the following grounds:\n\nThe defendant may take the following actions to seek a change of venue:\n\nIn both instances, the first step is to determine whether the first instance forum is the natural forum, or whether the forum has the closest connection with the action and the parties. The court adjudicates whether there is another forum that is more appropriate under the doctrine of comity. The current forum court must respect the right of a foreign court to assume jurisdiction. A court must balance the interests of the parties, since there is injustice not only when a plaintiff is allowed to pursue the action in a forum inconvenient to the defendant, but also when a plaintiff is not allowed a timely trial.\n\nGenerally, the court will not grant a petition to transfer or an injunction if the grant unjustly will deprive the plaintiff of advantages in the first instance forum. Nevertheless, a real and substantial connection between the venue and the cause(s) of action should exist to provide defendants some protection against being pursued in jurisdictions that have little or no connection with the transaction or the parties.\n\nIf the alternative court concludes that another court has assumed jurisdiction either without considering whether an alternative forum was available or has reached an obviously unreasonable conclusion on the merits, then an injunction would sometimes be a reasonable response. If, on the other hand, the alternative court has reasonably concluded that no more convenient forum was available, then comity requires it to respect the decision of the court that has already assumed jurisdiction and dismiss the application for an injunction and transfer. In cases where there is a sound argument to be made in favour of both courts, the court in the second venue should not arbitrarily claim a better right to decide for both jurisdictions. In most cases the adherence of the foreign court to principles resembling those applied in the second venue court will be obvious; if the foreign court has adhered, then the second venue court should refuse relief.\n\nThe term has become adopted in a wider context for the activity of repeatedly seeking a venue or willing listener for a concern, complaint or action, until one is found.\n\nIn child custody cases, where a parent is able to file a child custody case in more than one state, a claim of forum shopping made against the parent who filed the custody case moved to a state due to its more favorable laws is not likely to succeed. In one case, a court expressly acknowledged that the plaintiff had chosen to move to the state in order to benefit from the liberal divorce laws in that state. The court found that was perfectly appropriate and did not justify a stay or dismissal of the case.\n\nForum shopping may be seen as inappropriate when it is intended to secure a more sympathetic forum in a child custody case. Some courts have noted that the Hague Abduction Convention was designed to deter parents from engaging in international forum shopping in custody cases. Specifically, the Hague Convention attempts to prevent situations in which a parent dissatisfied with current custodial arrangements flees with the child to another country to re-litigate the merits of custody and to obtain a more favorable custody order. Nonetheless, at times, it may be in the best interests of a child to remove the child from a forum which does not apply the best interests test in child custody cases to a forum which has a \"better\" law and practice in such cases.\n\nIn a child custody dispute a pregnant women can legally engage in forum shopping before she gives birth, by giving birth in different a state/country that the child was conceived in. The mother has to move before (not after) her child is born in order to avoid a legal mess in the state/country where the child was conceived in.<ref>\n"}
{"id": "17623258", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17623258", "title": "Forward Commitment Procurement", "text": "Forward Commitment Procurement\n\nForward Commitment Procurement (FCP) is a procurement model that is designed to be used to deliver cost effective environmental products and services to the public sector and help to create the market conditions in which the environmental goods and services sector can thrive.\n\nThe model was conceived and developed by the UK Government's Environmental Innovation Advisory Group (EIAG) 2003-2008) to address a key market failure identified by EIAG, namely the lack of market pull for environmental innovations.\n\nThe first report of EIAG identified the Government as a key player in the environmental market, with a special responsibility as custodian of the common good to provide intelligent and effective supply chain management that could help to unlock investment in new environmental products and services.\n\nAs such, the public sector provides a lead market for environmental products and services, and this, coupled with the fact that the Government is a major purchaser of environmental goods and services, led EIAG to focus its activities on \"how Government and its agencies can improve on the way they manage the supply chain in this sector\" Jack Frost, Chairman of EIAG (2003–2008).\nIn essence then, our analysis turns the problem of innovation on its head. It is the lack of credible articulated demand that is at the root of the relative failure of innovation in the UK environmental goods and services sector not any lack of research, invention or innovative aspirations. EIAG believes the solution lies in Government taking action to mobilise the supply chain to deliver environmental innovations. And this means moving from a focus on R&D and technology push to a focus on intelligent supply chain management.\nEIAG developed FCP as a supply chain management tool primarily for use by public sector policy makers and procurers, although the approach it is equally relevant to, and has been picked up by, private sector bodies such as the New Swindon Company in a project concerning innovative combined cooling, heat and power (CCHP) plant and services. FCP in fact mirrors the approach taken by businesses to stimulate suppliers to invest in new products and services to meet their future needs.\n\nPrivate sector companies actively manage their supply chains by clearly articulating their future needs and providing a credible promise of future sales to provide security their suppliers need in order to make investments.\n\"The public sector, as both custodian of the common good and a major purchaser of environmental goods and services, is a natural lead market for environmental products and services. JERA have pioneered FCP as a practical mechanism to enable public sector organisations to fulfill this role, while at the same time delivering the cost effective solutions they need to pressing problems such as climate change and economic and social sustainability\". Gaynor Whyles, Director JERA Consulting\n\nThe FCP approach has been well received:\n\n• FCP was recommended by the UK Sustainable Procurement Task Force and adopted by the UK Government in their Sustainable Procurement Action Plan .\n• The Commission on Environmental Markets and Economic Performance called for the UK Government to scale up and replicate the FCP model in the public sector.\n• The EIAG FCP demonstration project (see below) was highlighted by HM Treasury in the publication ‘Transforming Government Procurement’ as an example of how innovation can be harnessed to improve services and value for money .\n• And highlighted as a best practice case study in 'Finding and Procuring Innovative Solutions, OGC/DIUS Report, 2007', \n\nThe Forward Commitment Procurement model involves providing the market with advance information of future needs in outcome terms, early engagement with potential suppliers and - most importantly - the incentive of a Forward Commitment: an agreement to purchase a product or service that currently does not exist, at a specified future date, providing it can be delivered to agreed performance levels and costs.\nThe Forward Commitment Procurement (FCP) Model\nThe FCP concept is simple and addresses a common “catch 22”. Sustainability objectives often require new products that are either not available in the market or are available at excessive cost. These products do not receive the investment required to enter and be competitive in the market because the need for them is not expressed to suppliers in a credible way.\n\nBy making the market aware of genuine needs and requirements and offering to buy products which meet these needs once they are available at a price commensurate with their benefits we can unlock this stalemate and unlock investment.\n\nEssentially, FCP is a tool to allocate and manage risk more effectively. It achieves this by providing business with crucial market information on performance and price coupled with assurances on future sales to reduce market risks.\n\nThis enables business to invest against technical/development risk which it is best placed to handle. The results in the customer getting what it needs, when it wants it at an affordable price. If suppliers cannot deliver to the required specification, the customer is no worse off (other than opportunity costs) and continues to purchase the existing technology.\n\nThe Forward Commitment Procurement project (managed on behalf BERR and DEFRA by Gaynor Whyles of JERA Consulting Ltd (previously JPS Consulting) from June 2005) set out to design and test a supply chain management tool for the public sector, in line with public procurement regulations, that would create the necessary market pull for environmental products and services and hence create the conditions that would support investment in the environmental industries sector.\n\nThe project involved:\n• designing a supply chain management approach and procurement process that was in line with public procurement regulations\n• testing this through a demonstration project\n• designing a mechanism to enable the scale up and replication of the approach\n\nThe EIAG FCP demonstration project was undertaken in partnership with Her Majesties Prison Services (HMPS) and the Office of Government Commerce (OGC). The role of OGC was to provide professional public procurement expertise and advice to the EIAG Project Manager to ensure that the FCP model was compliant with public procurement regulations and reflected best practice. The FCP model built upon and made practical guidance published by OGC in its information leaflet entitled Capturing Innovation (OGC, 2004)\n\nHMPS were buying in the order of 60,000 highly flame retardant, polyurethane foam mattresses and pillows per year and disposing of around 40,000, mainly to landfill, but with a significant number also being disposed of as clinical waste. The combined cost of supply and disposal was estimated to be well in excess of £3 million per year. In short, the way in which mattresses were disposed of was costly and environmentally unsustainable and out of step with HMPS sustainable development policy. There had been several attempts to find a solution none of which had delivered a meaningful result. HMPS had an 'unmet need' for a cost effective and environmentally sustainable solution.\n\nFurther consideration of the problem led HMPS to identify the following requirement:\n“HMPS aspires to a zero waste prison mattress that meets or exceeds current operational requirements and delivers whole life cycle cost efficiencies. By 2012, HMPS wants all its mattresses and pillows not classified as hazardous waste to be recycled, repurposed or reused instead of going to landfill; and to reduce to 2 per cent pa the number of mattresses disposed of as hazardous or clinical waste”.\n\nThis requirement was then communicated to the market in a market sounding exercise in the form of a 'call for innovation and information', designed and managed by the EIAG FCP team. (Market sounding is a way of “assessing the reaction of the market to a proposed requirement and procurement approach, in order to bring supplier perspectives to public sector procurements at an early stage”. This exercise involved the publication of a Prior Information Notice in the Official Journal of the European Union and the engagement of intermediaries, such as the BERR funded Knowledge Transfer Networks, trade bodies and similar, to communicate notification of the call to the potential supply chain.\n\nDetailed information on the requirement, the context for the call and the scale of the market opportunity were provided in a market sounding prospectus, and HMPS offered to consider a ‘forward commitment contract’ to enable the take up of innovative solutions.\n\nOver 36 high quality responses were received, and from which a range of options were identified. A directory of companies and organisations that responded to the call was published on the HMPS procurement website to assist supply chain development and a 'Concept Viability' workshop involving a cross section of the supply chain that submitted responses was held to discuss the options available and inform the HMPS mattress procurement strategy.\n\nThe market engagement process led HMPS to adopt a completely different approach to the procurement of its mattresses and pillows. HMPS is at the concluding stages of a procurement exercise for a 'cradle to cradle' managed service to supply zero waste mattress and pillows. The final stage of evaluation is underway and HMPS is confident that all of the shortlisted bids will be able to deliver the requirement (see above), and in addition estimates that it will save between £3-£5 million over the life of the contract.\n“Sustainable procurement has been talked about for years but the Prison Service launching a competition for zero waste mattresses was one of the few truly innovative examples CEMEP came across” Julie Hill, Member of the Commission on Environmental Markets and Economic Performance, from issue 18 of Inside Track magazine, Autumn 2007.\nAlthough all FCP projects are unique, they usually involve:\n• identification of an unmet need\n• placing this need in the context of a procurement i.e. a market opportunity\n• offering a forward commitment contract where required\n• articulating the requirement in outcome terms to potential suppliers, providing sufficient time for the market to respond\n• assisting the development of a supply chain\n• providing the supply chain with information on, and where possible a route to, the wider market\n• using outcome based procurement specifications\n• ensuring procurement processes are accessible to and do nor preclude small and medium-sized companies\n• use of the competitive dialogue process\n• use of a forward commitment procurement contract where required\n\nForward Commitment Procurement works best where there is:\n• a high level of leadership and staff commitment\n• a genuine need that current technology, products or commercial models cannot deliver\n• and / or cannot be delivered affordably\n• a procurement opportunity sufficient scale to stimulate the delivery of a solution\n• the ability to make a forward commitment of sufficient strength to generate the required market pull\n• potential for aggregation of demand within the organisation, region, and with other public sector bodies\n\nAt the time of writing (May 8) a number of FCP projects are getting underway. This include projects involving NHS Trusts, NHS Purchasing Supply Agency (NHS PASA), South West Regional Development Agency (SWRDA), Swindon Borough Council, New Swindon Company, and are addressing a range of environmental unmet needs such as ultra efficient lighting systems, innovative CCHP, water efficiency, and sustainable waste management solutions.\n\n"}
{"id": "4441514", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4441514", "title": "Frame of Government of Pennsylvania", "text": "Frame of Government of Pennsylvania\n\nThe Frame of Government of Pennsylvania was a constitution for the Province of Pennsylvania, a proprietary colony granted to William Penn by Charles II of England. The Frame of Government has lasting historical importance as an important step in the development of American and world democracy.\n\nWilliam Penn, as an English Quaker, sought to construct a new type of Community with religious toleration and a great deal of political freedom. It is believed that Penn’s political philosophy is embodied in the West Jersey Concessions and Agreements of 1677, which is an earlier practical experience of government constitution prior to the establishment of Pennsylvania. Although his authorship of the Concession is questioned, it is believed that he gave his full consent to it as the trustee of that colony. In the Concession, all legislative power was granted to an assembly selected by the \"inhabitants, freeholders and proprietors\" of the colony. A commission was to be appointed by the assembly as its executive. The government structure in West Jersey demonstrated the enlightened constitutional theory that Penn had been promoting.\n\nAlso under the influence of republican political theory and humanism, the first version of the Frame of Government of Pennsylvania (now known as the Frame of 1682) incorporated a few pioneering ideas, which were later developed into important elements of modern constitutionalism. It required capital punishment to be applied to a strictly limited scope of criminal offenses only, including murder and treason. Freedom of worship in the colony was to be absolute. The assembly could bring a request of impeachment of the governor before the council for its trial. Unconstitutional laws should be invalidated, although it did not specifically grant courts the power to declare the unconstitutionality. It included an amendment process where six-sevenths of the legislature and the governor had to approve any change. However, the government structure speculated by the Frame of 1682 was far less liberal than that in West Jersey Concessions and Agreements of 1677.\n\nThe Frame of 1682 constituted a parliament consisting of two houses. The upper house, or the council, consisted of 72 members who were the first fifty purchasers of 5,000 acres or more in the colony and had the exclusive power to propose legislation. They were also authorized to nominate all officers in church and state and supervise financial and military affairs through committees. The lower house, or the assembly, consisted of smaller landowners. It had no power to initiate legislation but could accept or reject the council’s legislative proposal only. The two-house parliament assists the governor with his executive functions.\n\nCommentators believe that the Frame of 1682 was significantly influenced by Penn’s supporters, primarily the earliest landholders in the colony. Little direct evidence suggested that they imposed a pressure upon the government constitution process. However, it is believed that the earliest settlers, who heavily invested in Pennsylvania, demanded a voice in constructing the framework of government.\n\nWilliam Markham, a trusted deputy executive of Penn in the colony for many years, commented:\n\n\"\"I knew very well [the Frame of Government] was forced upon him by friends who unless they received all that they demanded would not settle the country.\" \"\n\nThis partly explained Penn’s deviation from his political ideas on government constitution to accommodate the demands of the settlers.\n\nOne of the most controversial provisions in the Frame of 1682 was if the governor should be allowed a veto to legislation presented by the parliament. To attract colonists, Penn had at first reserved himself only a single vote in the council and no power to reject legislation passed by the assembly. However, the Frame of 1682, in its final form, granted the proprietor a greater power – he was allowed a treble vote in the council and a veto in the legislative process.\n\nIn December 1682, an assembly of 42 men was convened to ratify the Frame of 1682. Although leading Quakers secured their places in the assembly, their proposal to establish a proprietary government was adamantly opposed by the non-Quakers in the assembly, including representatives from the Lower Counties, which had been under the light control of the deputy governors appointed by the Duke of York (later James II & VII.) In particular, they rejected the monopoly of the council in initiating legislation and requested a more powerful assembly. As a result, the Frame of 1682 was voted down.\n\nAn assembly convened in 1683 to model a new frame of government in place of the rejected Frame of 1682. The tension which resulted in the rejection of the Frame of 1682 remained – although leading Quakers dominated the council, half of the seats in the assembly were occupied by non-Quakers from the Lower Counties who were steadfastly against the concentration of power to Quaker elites.\n\nThe proprietor’s voting power in the legislative process remained one of the major concerns in framing the government. As provided in the colonial charter granted by the King, laws were to be made by the proprietor. Thus, it would be a violation of the charter if the proprietor did not possess a veto power in legislation. Over lengthy debate, Penn managed to convince the assembly that the proprietor’s veto power was necessary, but guaranteed that he would exercise the power only with the council’s advice and consent.\n\nOnce again, the assembly sought to enlarge its role and insisted that it be granted to power to initiate legislation, as it demanded when it rejected the Frame of 1682. Although it was regarded as unacceptable to both the proprietor and the council, they conceded that the assembly is allowed to confer with the council before passing a law. A compromised frame of government, or the Frame of 1683, was eventually approved by the assembly. It provided that all laws should be passed \"by the Governor and the freemen in Council and Assembly met\", and granted the governor a right to approve or veto.\n\nHowever, the proprietary governance speculated by the Frame of 1683 did not function effectively after Penn returned to England in 1684. He relied on the council to act as governor collectively in the first few years during his absence. However, the council neglected Penn’s constitutional authority and promulgated laws without obtaining approval from Penn or the King. Penn subsequently appointed five commissioners to replace the council as his deputy executive. Having granted any three of the commissioners a power to enact, annul or vary laws \"as if I myself were there\", he instructed the commissioners to annul the laws passed without his approval. However, the commissioners never carried out such instructions. In 1687, Penn appointed John Blackwell to replace the five commissioners as a single executive. As an aggressive Puritan governor, Blackwell clashed with the Quakers’ assembly immediately after he was appointed. The disorder in Pennsylvania and William III’s increasing distrust in Penn led to the suspension of Penn’s charter as the colonial proprietor in 1692.\n\nPenn’s charter was restored in 1694. Presumably, he intended his colonists to return to the Frame of 1683, as one of the conditions on which his charter was restored was that the colony should be under proprietary governance. William Markham, the lieutenant governor commissioned by Penn in 1694, ruled the colony imperialistically and acted aggressively towards the assembly. However, certain practical needs in the colony significantly changed the political structure and dramatically resulted in liberal governance in this period, which was reflected in the Frame of 1696 (also known as Markham’s Frame).\n\nThe assembly continued to make effort to further its power in the 1690s. In March 1695, David Lloyd, the chief spokesman of the Quakers, warned that there was no special virtue in returning to the Frame of 1683, and proposed a charter granting the Assembly a controlling role, including the sole power to initiate legislation. The council turned to support the shift of power from itself to the assembly in anticipation of a possible reestablishment of a royal government. The Quakers dominating the council understood that with Penn’s charter under heavy attack by neighboring governors and English government officials, the reestablishment of royal government was \"highly possible – even probable\". In that situation, the Quakers found it necessary to invest the assembly with \"the widest possible powers in advance of such a change\". The council might be appointed by a royal governor and thus susceptible to a royal control. However, the assembly would always be elected. Outnumbering other factions, including the Anglicans, the Quakers believed that they would be able to dominate in the assembly. Thus, even if the Quakers lost their control over the council, they could still operate from the assembly to defend against a royal control.\n\nIn response to the Quakers’ request, William Markham, the lieutenant governor and a member of the Church of England, took it as an opportunity to urge the Quaker-dominated assembly to cooperate in appropriating fund for military preparations, and promised that a discussion of constitutional revision would become possible if the military appropriation bill was passed by the assembly. Although having been committed to nonviolence and consciously objecting to participating in wars, Quakers compromised in this regard in exchange for a more powerful assembly. Coupled with a bill raising a fund of £300 for military use, the assembly passed a new frame of government, which is known as the Frame of 1696, or Markham’s Frame. The new frame significantly changed the allocation of political power within the legislature by conferring upon the assembly the power to initiate legislation, sit on its own adjournment and judge the qualifications of its members. It also reduced the size of the legislature to a more manageable level – each county elected only two representatives to the council and four to the assembly. In addition, it provided for more stringent voting requirements to exclude non-Quakers from voting. A person needed to reside in the colony for two years before he could vote, suggesting an attempt to diminish the strength of the ever-growing number of non-Quaker immigrants newly arrived in the colony. In rural areas, where Quakers had a dominant representation in the population, the voting requirement was relaxed to include all freeholders with 50 acres rather than 100 acres as before. In urban areas where the number of non-Quakers was growing, the voting requirement was tightened to exclude anyone without a £50 estate free of debts.\n\nThe validity of the Frame of 1696 was questionable, as Markham did not have a conceivable right to approve it. It was never approved by Penn either – actually, Penn criticized it harshly. However, it functioned as the colonial constitution in practice for several years until Penn returned to Pennsylvania in 1699.\n\nAfter his 15 years’ absence, Penn returned to Pennsylvania in 1699 and found the assembly resisting his proprietary authority. His attempts to reinforce proprietary governance turned out to be unpopular. Hostility towards proprietary politics and desire for the legislature’s autonomy prevailed among the Quaker elite. In 1701, on the eve that Penn left Pennsylvania to defend his colonial charter before the King in London, the assembly presented him with a new draft of the frame of government, which is subsequently known as the Frame of 1701, or the Charter of Privileges.\n\nThe Frame of 1701 further strengthened the controlling role of the assembly. An elective council was not even mentioned in the legislative process, and thus the assembly became the sole legislative authority. Meanwhile, the assembly obtained several Anglo-Saxon standard parliamentary privileges constitutionally for the first time: the right to prepare legislative bills, elect its own officers, appoint committees, sit on its own adjournment, judge the qualifications of its own members, and impeach officers of government. The assembly was to be elected annually by freemen and composed of four representatives from each county. The governor may appoint a council to assist with executive affairs, the council does not have a role in the legislative process.\n\nIn addition, the Frame of 1701 required all claims relating to properties to be directed to ordinary courts of justice, and thus neutralized the power of the Board of Propriety, the center of proprietary land administration.\n\nAnother significant concession in the Frame of 1701 was that the Lower Counties, or Territories, are permitted to establish their home rules. In 1705, the Territories took advantage of this provision and set up their own assembly.\n\nAlthough Penn steadfastly refused to approve the Frame of 1696, he yielded to the Frame of 1701, which was different from the Frame of 1699 only in details. Some writers regarded his concession as a sign of his losing control over the colony. He admitted that he approved the Frame of 1701 only because he saw a majority had been convinced by David Lloyd that it was a form of government \"nearer to English methods, which they called for so often.\" Also, in anticipation of the possibility that his rights of government in the colony might be stripped of by the English Parliament, a more democratic governmental structure might provide the Quakers in the colony with a shelter from an arbitrary royal governor.\n\nThe Frame of 1701 remained the governing constitutional document in Pennsylvania in the following seventy-five years until the Revolution of 1776.\n\nThe establishment of Pennsylvania may be the most successful effort of Quakers in colonizing in America. Penn’s close relationship with the Crown significantly contributed to the success. His ruling over Pennsylvania was largely based on the royal charter, which curbed his political experiment and led to a hierarchical governmental structure. The compromise diluted the liberalism in the constitution of government, which Penn and his contemporary political thinkers had been promoting. However, the human rights provisions in the Frame of Government successfully reflected certain important values inherent in human thinking prevailing in the colony and Quakerism and contributed to the development of constitutionalism in America.\n\nThe Frame of Government has been seen as a significant move towards democracy in America. The political philosophy expounded in the preface to the Frame of 1682 has often been cited and quoted.\nVoltaire applauded Penn's efforts, saying he might \"with reason, boast of having brought down upon earth the Golden Age, which in all probability, never had any real existence but in his dominions.\" \n\n"}

Since the general Resolution of 1975, one of the primary objectives of the European Community, and then the European Union, has been the provision of information to consumers. The rationale is that market actors who are informed have a greater capacity to understand the importance of their market actions and choices, and are enabled in making better choices.\n\nAccording to the European Union, \"Information is a deciding factor for consumers when making their choices and affects both consumer interests and their confidence in the products and services circulating within the market.\"\n\nThe consumers expect to get fair treatment in the market place and avoid unscrupulous or sharp business dealings.\nThey envisage a fair market environment that facilitates and supports several consumer rights:\n\n\nWith the advent of electronic media in marketing, and the mass information storage capacity of computers, consumer privacy has become a great concern. Hence, consumers want to ensure privacy of information. The consumers want to be able to cast off the invasive marketing methods, and threat of entry into the private system of consumers.\nConsumer information is the most important element for consumer protection and policy decisions. It is the solution to issues ranging from online transactional threats, behavioural targeting, loss of privacy and other problems.\nA consumer must treat every purchase as an important Investment. Making an uninformed investment in the stock market can result in huge financial losses to consumer, the similar rule applies to daily purchases. Being an informed consumer is advantageous to the economy, market and consumers .\nAn informed consumer is capable of making sensible decisions, gains an insight about a product prior to its purchase. This insight equips the consumer with the data to arrive at an evidence based conclusion.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is the responsibility of the consumer to get all the information about the potential purchase and associated background before making a decision to buy it. \"Getting armed with information about the consequences of your purchase doesn't just make an informed consumer, it makes a Responsible consumer.\"\n\nTransparent information about the terms and conditions associated with the product or service can facilitate a plenty of regulatory requirements to redress the consumer related grievances. Primarily, complete information will level the information asymmetries, improve consumer's decision- making capability vis-à-vis the seller's complex knowledge about the product they are selling.\nConsumer information also harmonises and solve consumer problems, create awareness and guide their behaviour. Another important objective that is achieved by informing the consumer is impact on Competitive policy. This will enable the traders and service providers to give greater information to consumers about their product, educate them about the product quality and other specifications.\nIn addition to the compliance to the legal obligations, the business firms also have their planned, tactical and important business- related reasons behind informing the consumer. The business organisation ensure consumer's expectation management by equipping them with certain knowledge about the commodity.\nMany times, business face disincentive by providing information to the consumers, as it might harm the marketability and attractiveness of their product. This indicate the power gained on being an Informed consumer.\nThe economic analysis indicates that information asymmetry to consumer is a major ground for market failure, causing the consumer to make irrational decisions. Thus, unbiased information can solve the market problems by equipping the customers with appropriate information and thereby ensuring healthy market practices.\n\nConsumers derive their information from multiple sources. The following are the sources from where a consumer gathers the desired knowledge about the product:\nConsumer derives information from a variety sources, each source illustrating its own interest, skills and resources . However, it is essential for the consumers to recognise their personal interests and make a judicious decision.\n\nThe influx of electronic media and abundance of available information has triggered a complete transformation of the market orientation. There has been a transition in the \"traditional customer engagement\", whereby the model of teaching the customer about the product or service has changed to knowledge- ridden customers who know exactly where they want to spend their money. The digital invasion has initiated an exploration drive in the consumers, turning the consumers into 'Informed Consumers'. This trend can be substantiated by the research led by the firm Forrester that suggests \"buyers are often between 70 and 90 percent of the way through the sales process before they ever engage a vendor\". This evolution in the market- orientation is a challenge for the existing and the emerging businesses. Following are the steps to take advantage of changes in, market:\n\nConsumers are becoming web-savvy, mobile enabled data sifters, who attain complete knowledge about the product prior to even stepping in the store.\n\nTo deal with highly informed consumers, the marketer must do the following:\n\nWith the increase in the variety of sources for consumer education, it is important for the marketer to enter the sales process at an early stage. The marketer must move ahead of the curve and make sure to bring some value to the customer’s purchase beyond just fulfilling his/her need.\n\nEU consumer policy is designed to\nIn an efficient, integrated EU economy underpinned by EU-wide rules, you must be able to trust that your rights as a consumer will be upheld in the event of any problems when purchasing goods and services in other EU countries.\nAt an annual cost of just 5 cents per person, the EU's consumer protection programme for 2014–2020, is designed to enforce consumer laws throughout the single market, giving you a high level of legal protection.\n\nIn fact, whereas informed publics in developed countries are more trusting of small than big businesses (76% vs. 53%), emerging market respondents placed more trust in big businesses (79% vs. 70%). Overall, small businesses are slightly more trusted than big businesses (70% vs. 62%).\nLooking at company types, the study finds that trust in media companies rose from 52% of informed publics globally in 2012 to 57% this year.

The law modernizes copyright protection in Panama, provides for payment of royalties, facilitates the prosecution of copyright violators, protects computer software, and makes copyright infringement a felony. Although the lead prosecutor for IPR cases in the Attorney General's Office has taken a vigorous enforcement stance, the Copyright Office remains small and ineffective. The Copyright Office has been slow to draft and move forward further improvements to the Copyright Law to implement the new WIPO treaties (the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonographs Treaty). Nevertheless, their proposal also would establish new offences, such as for internet-based copyright violations, raise the penalties for infractions, and enhance border measures. This proposed draft legislation is moving forward with technical assistance from SIECA (the Central American Economic Integration System).\n\nA new Industrial Property Law (Law 35) went into force in 1996 and provides 20 years of patent protection from the date of filing. Pharmaceutical patents are granted for only 15 years, but can be renewed for an additional ten years, if the patent owner licenses a national company (minimum of 30 percent Panamanian ownership) to exploit the patent. The Industrial Property Law provides specific protection for trade secrets.\n\nLaw 35 also provides trademark protection, simplifying the process of registering trademarks and making them renewable for ten-year periods. The law's most important feature is the granting of \"ex officio\" authority to government agencies to conduct investigations and to seize materials suspected of being counterfeited. Decrees 123 of November 1996 and 79 of August 1997 specify the procedures to be followed by Customs and CFZ officials in conducting investigations and confiscating merchandise. In 1997, the Customs Directorate created a special office for IPR enforcement, followed by a similar office created by the CFZ in 1998. The Trademark Registration Office has undertaken significant modernization with a searchable computerized database of registered trademarks that is open to the public.\n\nPanama is a member of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), the Geneva Phonograms Convention, the Brussels Satellite Convention, the Universal Copyright Convention, the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, and the International Convention for the Protection of Plant Varieties. In addition, Panama was one of the first countries to ratify the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty.\n\nProtection of intellectual property rights (IPR) in Panama has increased significantly over the past several years. The government passed an Anti-Monopoly Law in 1996 mandating the creation of commercial courts to hear anti-trust, patent, trademark, and copyright cases exclusively. Two district courts and one superior tribunal began to operate in 1997 and have been adjudicating intellectual property disputes. IPR policy and practice in Panama is the responsibility of an Inter-institutional Committee. This committee consists of representatives of six government agencies and operates under the leadership of the Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade. It coordinates enforcement actions and develops strategies to improve compliance with the law.\n\n"}

Wainwright\", writing a first draft of a brief on behalf of Clarence Earl Gideon, a Florida drifter who had been tried and convicted without a lawyer. \n\nIn the fall of 1963, Ely trained with Company A of the United States Army's Military Police School at Fort Gordon, Georgia. Ely served as the youngest staff member of the Warren Commission, which investigated the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. He went on to clerk for U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren, whom he considered a hero, and to whom he dedicated his landmark book, \"Democracy and Distrust\" (1980). As a clerk for Warren during the 1964 Term, Ely authored the landmark decision \"Hanna v. Plumer\".\n\nJoining the faculty of Yale Law School in 1968, and moving to Harvard Law School in 1973, Ely wrote several influential law review articles, including a highly critical analysis of the Supreme Court's decision in \"Roe v. Wade\" in an article entitled \"The Wages of Crying Wolf,\" published in the \"Yale Law Journal\", wherein he argued that the Court's decision protecting abortion rights was wrong \"because it is not constitutional law and gives almost no sense of an obligation to try to be.\" \n\nEly's most notable work was his 1980 book \"Democracy and Distrust,\" which ranks as one of the most influential works about constitutional law ever written. In it, he argues against \"interpretivism\" of which Hugo Black was an exponent, \"originalism\" advanced by Robert Bork, and \"textualism\" advanced by Antonin Scalia, by contending that \"strict construction\" fails to do justice to the open texture of many of the Constitution's provisions; at the same time, though, he maintains that the notion that judges may infer broad moral rights and values from the Constitution is radically undemocratic, whether the \"moralism\" of Ronald Dworkin or the libertarian Richard Epstein. Instead, Ely argued that the Supreme Court should interpret the Constitution so as to reinforce democratic processes and popular self-government, by ensuring equal representation in the political process (as in the Court's decision in \"Baker v. Carr\" [1961]). He argues \"ejusdem generis\" that the Constitution's unenumerated rights (such as the 9th Amendment or the Privileges or Immunities clause of the 14th Amendment) are procedural in nature rather than substantive, thus protecting rights to democratic processes but not rights of a substantive nature. Justice Stone's Footnote Four from \"United States v. Carolene Products Co.\" (1938) is a chief inspiration for Ely's theory of judicial review.\n\nIn her recent book on Hans Kelsen, Sandrine Baume identified Ely as a significant defender of the \"compatibility of judicial review with the very principles of democracy.\" Ely was listed alongside Dworkin as one of the foremost defenders of this principle in recent years.\n\nEly went on to serve as dean of Stanford Law School from 1982 to 1987, and remained on the faculty until 1996. Prompted by his love of scuba diving, he visited the University of Miami School of Law in 1996. Discovering he liked the city and the faculty, he chose to stay and became the first holder of the law school's first endowed chair, named after Richard A. Hausler. Ely was there when he died of cancer, aged 64.\nHe was married to Gisela Cardonne Ely, who is a state judge in Miami, Florida.\n\nEly was formerly married to Nancy Halliday Ely-Raphel, a United States Ambassador to Slovenia.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4861356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4861356", "title": "Judicial review in the United States", "text": "Judicial review in the United States\n\nIn the United States, judicial review is the ability of a court to examine and decide if a statute, treaty or administrative regulation contradicts or violates the provisions of existing law, a State Constitution, or ultimately the United States Constitution. While the U.S. Constitution does not explicitly define a power of judicial review, the authority for judicial review in the United States has been inferred from the structure, provisions, and history of the Constitution.\n\nTwo landmark decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court served to confirm the inferred constitutional authority for judicial review in the United States: In 1796, \"Hylton v. United States\" was the first case decided by the Supreme Court involving a direct challenge to the constitutionality of an act of Congress, the Carriage Act of 1794 which imposed a \"carriage tax\". The Court engaged in the process of judicial review by examining the plaintiff's claim that the carriage tax was unconstitutional. After review, the Supreme Court decided the Carriage Act was constitutional. In 1803, \"Marbury v. Madison\" was the first Supreme Court case where the Court asserted its authority for judicial review to strike down a law as unconstitutional. At the end of his opinion in this decision, Chief Justice John Marshall maintained that the Supreme Court's responsibility to overturn unconstitutional legislation was a necessary consequence of their sworn oath of office to uphold the Constitution as instructed in Article Six of the Constitution.\n\n, the United States Supreme Court has held 176 Acts of the U.S. Congress unconstitutional.\n\nBefore the Constitutional Convention in 1787, the power of judicial review had been exercised in a number of states. In the years from 1776 to 1787, state courts in at least seven of the thirteen states had engaged in judicial review and had invalidated state statutes because they violated the state constitution or other higher law. These state courts treated state constitutions as statements of governing law to be interpreted and applied by judges. These courts reasoned that because their state constitution was the fundamental law of the state, they must apply the state constitution rather than an act of the legislature that was inconsistent with the state constitution.\n\nThese state court cases involving judicial review were reported in the press and produced public discussion and comment. At least seven of the delegates to the Constitutional Convention, including Alexander Hamilton and Edmund Randolph, had personal experience with judicial review because they had been lawyers or judges in these state court cases involving judicial review. Other delegates referred to some of these state court cases during the debates at the Constitutional Convention. The concept of judicial review therefore was familiar to the framers and to the public before the Constitutional Convention.\n\nThe text of the Constitution does not contain a specific reference to the power of judicial review. Rather, the power to declare laws unconstitutional has been deemed an implied power, derived from Article III and Article VI.\n\nThe provisions relating to the federal judicial power in Article III state:\n\nThe Supremacy Clause of Article VI states:\n\nThe power of judicial review has been implied from these provisions based on the following reasoning. It is the inherent duty of the courts to determine the applicable law in any given case. The Supremacy Clause says \"[t]his Constitution\" is the \"supreme law of the land.\" The Constitution therefore is the fundamental law of the United States. Federal statutes are the law of the land only when they are \"made in pursuance\" of the Constitution. State constitutions and statutes are valid only if they are consistent with the Constitution. Any law contrary to the Constitution is void. The federal judicial power extends to all cases \"arising under this Constitution.\" As part of their inherent duty to determine the law, the federal courts have the duty to interpret and apply the Constitution and to decide whether a federal or state statute conflicts with the Constitution. All judges are bound to follow the Constitution. If there is a conflict, the federal courts have a duty to follow the Constitution and to treat the conflicting statute as unenforceable. The Supreme Court has final appellate jurisdiction in all cases arising under the Constitution, so the Supreme Court has the ultimate authority to decide whether statutes are consistent with the Constitution.\n\nDuring the debates at the Constitutional Convention, the Founding Fathers made a number of references to the concept of judicial review. The greatest number of these references occurred during the discussion of the proposal known as the Virginia Plan. The Virginia Plan included a \"council of revision\" that would have examined proposed new federal laws and would have accepted or rejected them, similar to today's presidential veto. The \"council of revision\" would have included the President along with some federal judges. Several delegates objected to the inclusion of federal judges on the council of revision. They argued the federal judiciary, through its power to declare laws unconstitutional, already had the opportunity to protect against legislative encroachment, and the judiciary did not need a second way to negate laws by participating in the council of revision. For example, Elbridge Gerry said federal judges \"would have a sufficient check against encroachments on their own department by their exposition of the laws, which involved a power of deciding on their constitutionality. In some states the judges had actually set aside laws, as being against the constitution. This was done too with general approbation.\" Luther Martin said: \"[A]s to the constitutionality of laws, that point will come before the judges in their official character. In this character they have a negative on the laws. Join them with the executive in the revision, and they will have a double negative.\" These and other similar comments by the delegates indicated that the federal courts would have the power of judicial review.\n\nOther delegates argued that if federal judges were involved in the law-making process through participation on the council of revision, their objectivity as judges in later deciding on the constitutionality of those laws could be impaired. These comments indicated a belief that the federal courts would have the power to declare laws unconstitutional.\n\nAt several other points in the debates at the Constitutional Convention, delegates made comments indicating their belief that under the Constitution, federal judges would have the power of judicial review. For example, James Madison said: \"A law violating a constitution established by the people themselves, would be considered by the Judges as null & void.\" George Mason said that federal judges \"could declare an unconstitutional law void.\" However, Mason added that the power of judicial review is not a general power to strike down all laws, but only ones that are unconstitutional:\n\nBut with regard to every law however unjust, oppressive or pernicious, which did not come plainly under this description, they would be under the necessity as Judges to give it a free course.\n\nIn all, fifteen delegates from nine states made comments regarding the power of the federal courts to review the constitutionality of laws. All but two of them supported the idea that the federal courts would have the power of judicial review. Some delegates to the Constitutional Convention did not speak about judicial review during the Convention, but did speak about it before or after the Convention. Including these additional comments by Convention delegates, scholars have found that twenty-five or twenty-six of the Convention delegates made comments indicating support for judicial review, while three to six delegates opposed judicial review. One review of the debates and voting records of the convention counted as many as forty delegates who supported judicial review, with four or five opposed.\n\nIn their comments relating to judicial review, the framers indicated that the power of judges to declare laws unconstitutional was part of the system of separation of powers. The framers stated that the courts' power to declare laws unconstitutional would provide a check on the legislature, protecting against excessive exercise of legislative power.\n\nJudicial review was discussed in at least seven of the thirteen state ratifying conventions, and was mentioned by almost two dozen delegates. In each of these conventions, delegates asserted that the proposed Constitution would allow the courts to exercise judicial review. There is no record of any delegate to a state ratifying convention who indicated that the federal courts would not have the power of judicial review.\n\nFor example, James Wilson asserted in the Pennsylvania ratifying convention that federal judges would exercise judicial review: \"If a law should be made inconsistent with those powers vested by this instrument in Congress, the judges, as a consequence of their independence, and the particular powers of government being defined, will declare such law to be null and void. For the power of the Constitution predominates. Anything, therefore, that shall be enacted by Congress contrary thereto will not have the force of law.\"\n\nIn the Connecticut ratifying convention, Oliver Ellsworth likewise described judicial review as a feature of the Constitution: \"This Constitution defines the extent of the powers of the general government. If the general legislature should at any time overleap their limits, the judicial department is a constitutional check. If the United States go beyond their powers, if they make a law which the Constitution does not authorize, it is void; and the judicial power, the national judges, who, to secure their impartiality, are to be made independent, will declare it to be void.\"\n\nDuring the ratification process, supporters and opponents of ratification published pamphlets, essays, and speeches debating various aspects of the Constitution. Publications by over a dozen authors in at least twelve of the thirteen states asserted that under the Constitution, the federal courts would have the power of judicial review. There is no record of any opponent to the Constitution who claimed that the Constitution did not involve a power of judicial review.\n\nAfter reviewing the statements made by the founders, one scholar concluded: \"The evidence from the Constitutional Convention and from the state ratification conventions is overwhelming that the original public meaning of the term 'judicial power' [in Article III] included the power to nullify unconstitutional laws.\"\n\n\"The Federalist Papers\", which were published in 1787–1788 to promote ratification of the Constitution, made several references to the power of judicial review. The most extensive discussion of judicial review was in Federalist No. 78, written by Alexander Hamilton, which clearly explained that the federal courts would have the power of judicial review. Hamilton stated that under the Constitution, the federal judiciary would have the power to declare laws unconstitutional. Hamilton asserted that this was appropriate because it would protect the people against abuse of power by Congress:\n\nIn Federalist No. 80, Hamilton rejected the idea that the power to decide the constitutionality of an act of Congress should lie with each of the states: \"The mere necessity of uniformity in the interpretation of the national laws, decides the question. Thirteen independent courts of final jurisdiction over the same causes, arising upon the same laws, is a hydra in government, from which nothing but contradiction and confusion can proceed.\" Consistent with the need for uniformity in interpretation of the Constitution, Hamilton explained in Federalist No. 82 that the Supreme Court has authority to hear appeals from the state courts in cases relating to the Constitution.\n\nThe arguments against ratification by the Anti-Federalists agreed that the federal courts would have the power of judicial review, though the Anti-Federalists viewed this negatively. Robert Yates, writing under the pseudonym \"Brutus\", stated:\n\nThe first Congress passed the , establishing the lower federal courts and specifying the details of federal court jurisdiction. Section 25 of the Judiciary Act provided for the Supreme Court to hear appeals from state courts when the state court decided that a federal statute was invalid, or when the state court upheld a state statute against a claim that the state statute was repugnant to the Constitution. This provision gave the Supreme Court the power to review state court decisions involving the constitutionality of both federal statutes and state statutes. The Judiciary Act thereby incorporated the concept of judicial review.\n\nBetween the ratification of the Constitution in 1788 and the decision in \"Marbury v. Madison\" in 1803, judicial review was employed in both the federal and state courts. A detailed analysis has identified thirty-one state or federal cases during this time in which statutes were struck down as unconstitutional, and seven additional cases in which statutes were upheld but at least one judge concluded the statute was unconstitutional. The author of this analysis, Professor William Treanor, concluded: \"The sheer number of these decisions not only belies the notion that the institution of judicial review was created by Chief Justice Marshall in \"Marbury\", it also reflects widespread acceptance and application of the doctrine.\"\n\nSeveral other cases involving judicial review issues reached the Supreme Court before the issue was definitively decided in \"Marbury\" in 1803.\n\nIn \"Hayburn's Case\", 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 408 (1792), federal circuit courts held an act of Congress unconstitutional for the first time. Three federal circuit courts found that Congress had violated the Constitution by passing an act requiring circuit court judges to decide pension applications, subject to the review of the Secretary of War. These circuit courts found that this was not a proper judicial function under Article III. These three decisions were appealed to the Supreme Court, but the appeals became moot when Congress repealed the statute while the appeals were pending.\n\nIn an unreported Supreme Court decision in 1794, \"United States v. Yale Todd\", the Supreme Court reversed a pension that was awarded under the same pension act that had been at issue in \"Hayburn's Case\". The Court apparently decided that the act designating judges to decide pensions was not constitutional because this was not a proper judicial function. This apparently was the first Supreme Court case to find an act of Congress unconstitutional. However, there was not an official report of the case and it was not used as a precedent.\n\n\"Hylton v. United States\", 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 171 (1796), was the first case decided by the Supreme Court that involved a challenge to the constitutionality of an act of Congress. It was argued that a federal tax on carriages violated the constitutional provision regarding \"direct\" taxes. The Supreme Court upheld the tax, finding it was constitutional. Although the Supreme Court did not strike down the act in question, the Court engaged in the process of judicial review by considering the constitutionality of the tax. The case was widely publicized at the time, and observers understood that the Court was testing the constitutionality of an act of Congress. Because it found the statute valid, the Court did not have to assert that it had the power to declare a statute unconstitutional.\n\nIn \"Ware v. Hylton\", 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 199 (1796), the Supreme Court for the first time struck down a state statute. The Court reviewed a Virginia statute regarding pre-Revolutionary war debts and found that it was inconsistent with the peace treaty between the United States and Great Britain. Relying on the Supremacy Clause, the Court found the Virginia statute invalid.\n\nIn \"Hollingsworth v. Virginia\", 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 378 (1798), the Supreme Court found that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the case because of the jurisdiction limitations of the Eleventh Amendment. This holding could be viewed as an implicit finding that the Judiciary Act of 1789, which would have allowed the Court jurisdiction, was unconstitutional in part. However, the Court did not provide any reasoning for its conclusion and did not say that it was finding the statute unconstitutional.\n\nIn \"Cooper v. Telfair\", 4 U.S. (4 Dall.) 14 (1800), Justice Chase stated: \"It is indeed a general opinion—it is expressly admitted by all this bar and some of the judges have, individually in the circuits decided, that the Supreme Court can declare an act of Congress to be unconstitutional, and therefore invalid, but there is no adjudication of the Supreme Court itself upon the point.\"\n\nIn 1798, the Kentucky and Virginia legislatures passed a series of resolutions asserting that the states have the power to determine whether acts of Congress are constitutional. In response, ten states passed their own resolutions disapproving the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions. Six of these states took the position that the power to declare acts of Congress unconstitutional lies in the federal courts, not in the state legislatures. For example, Vermont's resolution stated: \"It belongs not to state legislatures to decide on the constitutionality of laws made by the general government; this power being exclusively vested in the judiciary courts of the Union.\"\n\nThus, five years before \"Marbury v. Madison\", a number of state legislatures stated their understanding that under the Constitution, the federal courts possess the power of judicial review.\n\nThe Supreme Court's landmark decision regarding judicial review is \"Marbury v. Madison\", 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 (1803). \"Marbury\" was the first Supreme Court decision to strike down an act of Congress as unconstitutional. Chief Justice John Marshall wrote the opinion for a unanimous Court.\n\nThe case arose when William Marbury filed a lawsuit seeking an order (a \"writ of mandamus\") requiring the Secretary of State, James Madison, to deliver to Marbury a commission appointing him as a justice of the peace. Marbury filed his case directly in the Supreme Court, invoking the Court's \"original jurisdiction\", rather than filing in a lower court.\n\nThe constitutional issue involved the question of whether the Supreme Court had jurisdiction to hear the case. The Judiciary Act of 1789 gave the Supreme Court original jurisdiction in cases involving writs of mandamus. So, under the Judiciary Act, the Supreme Court would have had jurisdiction to hear Marbury's case. However, the Constitution describes the cases in which the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction, and does not include mandamus cases. The Judiciary Act therefore attempted to give the Supreme Court jurisdiction that was not \"warranted by the Constitution.\"\n\nMarshall's opinion stated that in the Constitution, the people established a government of limited powers: \"The powers of the Legislature are defined and limited; and that those limits may not be mistaken or forgotten, the Constitution is written.\" The limits established in the Constitution would be meaningless \"if these limits may at any time be passed by those intended to be restrained.\" Marshall observed that the Constitution is \"the fundamental and paramount law of the nation\", and that it cannot be altered by an ordinary act of the legislature. Therefore, \"an act of the Legislature repugnant to the Constitution is void.\"\n\nMarshall then discussed the role of the courts, which is at the heart of the doctrine of judicial review. It would be an \"absurdity\", said Marshall, to require the courts to apply a law that is void. Rather, it is the inherent duty of the courts to interpret and apply the Constitution, and to determine whether there is a conflict between a statute and the Constitution:\n\nMarshall stated that the courts are authorized by the provisions of the Constitution itself to \"look into\" the Constitution, that is, to interpret and apply it, and that they have the duty to refuse to enforce any laws that are contrary to the Constitution. Specifically, Article III provides that the federal judicial power \"is extended to all cases arising under the Constitution.\" Article VI requires judges to take an oath \"to support this Constitution.\" Article VI also states that only laws \"made in pursuance of the Constitution\" are the law of the land. Marshall concluded: \"Thus, the particular phraseology of the Constitution of the United States confirms and strengthens the principle, supposed to be essential to all written Constitutions, that a law repugnant to the Constitution is void, and that courts, as well as other departments, are bound by that instrument.\"\n\n\"Marbury\" long has been regarded as the seminal case with respect to the doctrine of judicial review. Some scholars have suggested that Marshall's opinion in \"Marbury\" essentially created judicial review. In his book \"The Least Dangerous Branch\", Professor Alexander Bickel wrote:\n\nOther scholars view this as an overstatement, and argue that \"Marbury\" was decided in a context in which judicial review already was a familiar concept. These scholars point to the facts showing that judicial review was acknowledged by the Constitution's framers, was explained in the Federalist Papers and in the ratification debates, and was used by both state and federal courts for more than twenty years before \"Marbury\", including the Supreme Court in \"Hylton v. United States\". One scholar concluded: \"[B]efore \"Marbury\", judicial review had gained wide support.\"\n\n\"Marbury\" was the point at which the Supreme Court adopted a monitoring role over government actions. After the Court exercised its power of judicial review in \"Marbury\", it avoided striking down a federal statute during the next fifty years. The court would not do so again until \"Dred Scott v. Sandford\", 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393 (1857).\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court did exercise judicial review in other contexts. In particular, the Court struck down a number of state statutes that were contrary to the Constitution. The first case in which the Supreme Court struck down a state statute as unconstitutional was \"Fletcher v. Peck\", 10 U.S. (6 Cranch) 87 (1810).\n\nIn a few cases, state courts took the position that their judgments were final and were not subject to review by the Supreme Court. They argued that the Constitution did not give the Supreme Court the authority to review state court decisions. They asserted that the Judiciary Act of 1789, which provided that the Supreme Court could hear certain appeals from state courts, was unconstitutional. In effect, these state courts were asserting that the principle of judicial review did not extend to allow federal review of state court decisions. This would have left the states free to adopt their own interpretations of the Constitution.\n\nThe Supreme Court rejected this argument. In \"Martin v. Hunter's Lessee\", 14 U.S. (1 Wheat.) 304 (1816), the Court held that under Article III, the federal courts have jurisdiction to hear all cases arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States, and that the Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction in all such cases, whether those cases are filed in state or federal courts. The Court issued another decision to the same effect in the context of a criminal case, \"Cohens v. Virginia\", 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 264 (1821). It is now well established that the Supreme Court may review decisions of state courts that involve federal law.\n\nThe Supreme Court also has reviewed actions of the federal executive branch to determine whether those actions were authorized by acts of Congress or were beyond the authority granted by Congress.\n\nJudicial review is now well established as a cornerstone of constitutional law. As of September 2017, the United States Supreme Court had held unconstitutional portions or the entirety of some 182 Acts of the U.S. Congress, the most recent in the Supreme Court's June 2017 Matal v. Tam decision striking down a portion of July 1946's Lanham Act.\n\nAlthough judicial review has now become an established part of constitutional law in the United States, there are some who disagree with the doctrine.\n\nAt the Constitutional Convention, neither proponents nor opponents of judicial review disputed that any government based on a written constitution requires some mechanism to prevent laws that violate that constitution from being made and enforced. Otherwise, the document would be meaningless, and the legislature, with the power to enact any laws whatsoever, would be the supreme arm of government (the British doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty). The delegates at the Convention differed with respect to the question of whether Congress or the judiciary should make determinations regarding constitutionality of statutes. Hamilton addressed this in Federalist No. 78, in which he explained the reasons that the federal judiciary has the role of reviewing the constitutionality of statutes:\n\nSince the adoption of the Constitution, some have argued that the power of judicial review gives the courts the ability to impose their own views of the law, without an adequate check from any other branch of government. Robert Yates, a delegate to the Constitutional Convention from New York, argued during the ratification process in the Anti-Federalist Papers that the courts would use the power of judicial review loosely to impose their views about the \"spirit\" of the Constitution:\n\nIn 1820, Thomas Jefferson expressed his opposition to the doctrine of judicial review:\n\nIn 1861, Abraham Lincoln touched upon the same subject, during his first inaugural address:\n\nLincoln was alluding here to the case of \"Dred Scott v. Sandford\", in which the Court had struck down a federal statute for the first time since \"Marbury v. Madison\".\n\nIt has been argued that the judiciary is not the only branch of government that may interpret the meaning of the Constitution. Article VI requires federal and state officeholders to be bound \"by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution.\" It has been argued that such officials may follow their own interpretations of the Constitution, at least until those interpretations have been tested in court.\n\nSome have argued that judicial review is unconstitutional based on two arguments. First, the power of judicial review is not expressly delegated to the courts in the Constitution. The Tenth Amendment reserves to the states (or to the people) those powers not delegated to the federal government. The second argument is that the states alone have the power to ratify changes to the \"supreme law\" (the U.S. Constitution), and that the states should play some role in interpreting its meaning. Under this theory, allowing only federal courts to definitively conduct judicial review of federal law allows the national government to interpret its own restrictions as it sees fit, with no meaningful input from the ratifying power.\n\nIn the United States, unconstitutionality is the \"only\" ground for a federal court to strike down a federal statute. Justice Washington, speaking for the Marshall Court, put it this way in an 1829 case:\n\nIf a state statute conflicts with a valid federal statute, then courts may strike down the state statute as an unstatutable violation of the Supremacy Clause. But a federal court may not strike down a statute absent a violation of federal law or of the federal Constitution.\n\nMoreover, a suspicion or possibility of unconstitutionality is not enough for American courts to strike down a statute. Alexander Hamilton explained in Federalist 78 that the standard of review should be \"irreconcilable variance\" with the Constitution. Anti-federalists agreed that courts would be unable to strike down federal statutes absent a conflict with the Constitution. For example, Robert Yates, writing under the pseudonym \"Brutus\", asserted that \"the courts of the general government [will] be under obligation to observe the laws made by the general legislature not repugnant to the constitution.\"\n\nThese principles—that federal statutes can only be struck down for unconstitutionality and that the unconstitutionality must be clear—were very common views at the time of the framing of the Constitution. For example, George Mason explained during the constitutional convention that judges \"could declare an unconstitutional law void. But with regard to every law, however unjust, oppressive or pernicious, which did not come plainly under this description, they would be under the necessity as Judges to give it a free course.\"\n\nFor a number of years, the courts were relatively deferential to Congress. Justice Washington put it this way, in an 1827 case: \"It is but a decent respect to the wisdom, integrity, and patriotism of the legislative body, by which any law is passed, to presume in favor of its validity, until its violation of the Constitution is proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\nAlthough judges usually adhered to this principle that a statute could only be deemed unconstitutional in case of a clear contradiction until the twentieth century, this presumption of constitutionality weakened somewhat during the twentieth century, as exemplified by the Supreme Court's famous footnote four in \"United States v. Carolene Products Co.\", 304 U.S. 144 (1938), which suggested that statutes may be subjected to closer scrutiny in certain types of cases. Nevertheless, the federal courts have not departed from the principle that courts may only strike down statutes for unconstitutionality.\n\nOf course, the practical implication of this principle is that a court cannot strike down a statute, even if it recognizes that the statute is obviously poorly drafted, irrational, or arises from legislators' corrupt motives, unless the flaw in the statute rises to the level of a clear constitutional violation. In 2008, Justice John Paul Stevens reaffirmed this point in a concurring opinion: \"[A]s I recall my esteemed former colleague, Thurgood Marshall, remarking on numerous occasions: 'The Constitution does not prohibit legislatures from enacting stupid laws.'\"\n\nIn the federal system, courts may only decide actual cases or controversies; it is not possible to request the federal courts to review a law without at least one party having legal standing to engage in a lawsuit. This principle means that courts sometimes do not exercise their power of review, even when a law is seemingly unconstitutional, for want of jurisdiction. In some state courts, such as the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, legislation may be referred in certain circumstances by the legislature or by the executive for an advisory ruling on its constitutionality prior to its enactment (or enforcement).\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court seeks to avoid reviewing the Constitutionality of an act where the case before it could be decided on other grounds, an attitude and practice exemplifying judicial restraint. Justice Brandeis framed it thus (citations omitted):\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court continues to review the constitutionality of statutes, Congress and the states retain some power to influence what cases come before the Court. For example, the Constitution at Article III, Section 2, gives Congress power to make exceptions to the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction. The Supreme Court has historically acknowledged that its appellate jurisdiction is defined by Congress, and thus Congress may have power to make some legislative or executive actions unreviewable. This is known as jurisdiction stripping.\n\nAnother way for Congress to limit judicial review was tried in January 1868, when a bill was proposed requiring a two-thirds majority of the Court in order to deem any Act of Congress unconstitutional. The bill was approved by the House, 116 to 39. That measure died in the Senate, partly because the bill was unclear about how the bill's own constitutionality would be decided.\n\nMany other bills have been proposed in Congress that would require a supermajority in order for the justices to exercise judicial review. During the early years of the United States, a two-thirds majority was necessary for the Supreme Court to exercise judicial review; because the Court then consisted of six members, a simple majority and a two-thirds majority both required four votes. Currently, the constitutions of two states require a supermajority of supreme court justices in order to exercise judicial review: Nebraska (five out of seven justices) and North Dakota (four out of five justices).\n\nThe procedure for judicial review of federal administrative regulation in the United States is set forth by the Administrative Procedure Act although the courts have ruled such as in \"Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents\" that a person may bring a case on the grounds of an implied cause of action when no statutory procedure exists.\n\n"}

The specific rights and duties are referred to as \"obligations\", and this area of law deals with their creation, effects and extinction.\n\nAn obligation is a legal bond (\"vinculum iuris\") by which one or more parties (obligants) are bound to act or refrain from acting. An obligation thus imposes on the \"obligor\" a duty to perform, and simultaneously creates a corresponding right to demand performance by the \"obligee\" to whom performance is to be tendered.\n\nJustinian first defines an obligation (\"obligatio\") in his \"Institutiones\", Book 3, section 13 as \"a legal bond, with which we are bound by necessity of performing some act according to the laws of our State.\" He further separates the law of obligations into contracts, delicts, quasi-contracts, and quasi-delicts.\n\nNowadays, obligation, as applied under civilian law, means a legal tie (\"vinculum iuris\") by which one or more parties (obligants) are bound to perform or refrain from performing specified conduct (prestation). Thus an obligation encompasses both sides of the equation, both the obligor's duty to render prestation and the obligee's right to receive prestation. It differs from the common-law concept of obligation which only encompasses the duty aspect.\n\nEvery obligation has four essential requisites otherwise known as the elements of obligation. They are:\n\nObligations arising out of the will of the parties are called \"voluntary\", and those imposed by operation of law are called \"involuntary\". Sometimes these are called conventional and obediential. The events giving rise to obligations may be further distinguished into specified categories.\n\nA contract can be broadly defined as an agreement that is enforceable at law. Gaius classified contracts into four categories which are: contracts \"consensu\", verbal contracts, contracts \"re\", and contracts \"litteris\". But this classification cannot cover all the contracts, such as pacts and innominate contracts; thus, it is no longer used.\n\nQuasi-contract is one of the four categories of obligation in Justinian's classification. The main cases are \"negotiorum gestio\" (conducting of another person's affairs without their authorisation), unjust enrichment, and \"solutio indebiti\".\n\nThe designation comprised a group of actions of no obvious similarity, classified by Justinian as analogous to delictual obligations. It includes \"res suspensae\", things po\nured or thrown, shippers/innkeepers/stablekeepers, and erring judges.\n\nObligations are classified according to the nature of the performance (prestation):\n\nThe word originally derives from the Latin \"obligare\" which comes from the root \"lig\" which suggests being bound, as one is to God for instance in \"re-ligio\". This term first appears in Plautus' play Truculentus at line 214.\n\nObligations did not originally form part of Roman Law, which mostly concerned issues of succession, property, and family relationships. It developed as a solution to a gap in the system, when one party committed a wrong against another party. These situations were originally governed by a basic customary law of revenge. This undesirable situation eventually developed into a system of liability where people were at first encouraged and then essentially forced to accept monetary compensation from the wrongdoer or their family instead of seeking vengeance. This signaled an important shift in the law away from vengeance and towards compensation. The state supported this effort by standardizing amounts for certain wrongs. Thus the earliest form of Obligation law derives out of what we would today call Delict.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that liability in this form did not yet include the idea that the debtor \"owed\" monetary compensation to the creditor, it was merely a means of avoiding punishment. If the debtor or his family didn't have the means to pay then the old rules still applied as outlined in the twelve tables specifically table 3. This section, despite how harsh it may appear to us, was originally developed as a means to protect debtors from the excessive abuses of creditors.\n\n"}

The origin of the doubling—and sometimes even tripling—often lies in the transition from use of one language for legal purposes to use of another for the same purposes, as from a Germanic ([Anglo-]Saxon or Old English) term to a Romance (Latin or Law French) term or, within the Romance subfamily, from a Latin term to a Law French term. To ensure understanding, words of Germanic origin were often paired with words having equivalent or near-equivalent meanings in Latin (reflecting the interactions between Germanic and Roman law following the decline of the Roman Empire) or, later, Law French (reflecting the influence of the Norman Conquest), and words of Latin origin were often paired with their Law French cognates or outright descendants. Such phrases can often be pleonasms and Siamese twins. In other cases, the two components did not arise through such synonym annotation but rather referred to two differentiable ideas whose differentiation is subtle, appreciable only to lawyers, long since obsolete, or a combination of those. For example, \"ways and means\", referring to methods and resources respectively, are differentiable, in the same way that \"tools and materials\", or \"equipment and funds\", are differentiable—but the difference between them is often practically irrelevant to the contexts in which the Siamese twin \"ways and means\" is used today in non-legal contexts as a mere cliché where one word would do (for example, \"methods\"), and because each of the words can practically mean \"methods\", the second can seem redundant in the clichéd, non-legal instances. \n\n"}

She has also made substantial contributions to other philosophical fields including political philosophy, the philosophy of law, and in ethics. \n\nGilbert was born in the United Kingdom and obtained a \"double first\" B.A. degree in Classics and Philosophy from Cambridge University and a B.Phil. and D.Phil. degree in Philosophy from Oxford University. From 1983 until 2006, she taught at the University of Connecticut, Storrs, where she was Professor of Philosophy. As of Fall 2006, she holds the Abraham I. Melden Chair in Moral Philosophy at the University of California, Irvine. She has been a visiting teacher and researcher at many academic institutions including Princeton University, the Institute for Advanced Study, the University of Pennsylvania, Indiana University, Wolfson College, Oxford, Technische Universität Dresden, King's College London, and the Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study in the Social Sciences, and regularly gives invited lectures in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere. Gilbert was married to noted philosopher Saul Kripke and is the sister of famed British historian Sir Martin Gilbert. In 2016, Margaret Gilbert was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nIn her book \"On Social Facts\" (1989) Gilbert presented novel accounts of a number of central social phenomena in the context of critical reflections on proposals by the founders of sociology Émile Durkheim, Georg Simmel, and Max Weber and others, including the philosopher David Lewis. The phenomena discussed include social conventions, social groups in a central sense of the term, group languages, collective belief, and acting together. Gilbert argued that these were all 'plural subject phenomena'. In a summary passage she writes, with allusion to Rousseau, that \"One is willing to be the member of a plural subject if one is willing, at least in relation to certain conditions, to put one's own will into a 'pool of wills' dedicated, as one, to a single goal (or whatever it is that the pool is dedicated to)\" (18). If two or more people have openly expressed such willingness in relation to a particular goal, in conditions of common knowledge, then the pertinent pool of wills is set up. In other words, the people concerned constitute the plural subject of the goal. As an alternative to talking of a pool of wills Gilbert refers also to joint commitment as when she writes: \" the wills of the parties are jointly committed\" (198). In later work she has preferred the language of joint commitment. Gilbert compares the plural subject to the singular subject and argues, with allusion to Durkheim, that \"In order for individual human beings to form collectivities, they must take on a special character, a 'new' character, insofar as they need not, \"qua\" human beings, have that character. Moreover, humans must form a whole or unit of a special kind...a plural subject\" (431).\n\nIn subsequent writings Gilbert has continued the development and application of her plural subject theory. Each of the essay collections \"Living Together\" (1996), \"Sociality and Responsibility\" (2000) and \"Marcher Ensemble\" (in French) (2003) is composed of relevant papers authored by Gilbert.\n\nIn her book \"A Theory of Political Obligation\" (2006; 2008) Gilbert offers a new perspective on a classical problem in political philosophy, generally known as 'the' problem of political obligation. As Gilbert makes clear in her book, there are many versions of this problem. She addresses the question whether there is something about one's being the member of a particular society that means one is obligated to uphold the political institutions of that society. Unlike most contemporary writers on the subject, she does not insist that the obligation in question is a matter of moral requirement. Gilbert argues that there are obligations of a different sort, and that these that are a function of membership in a political society construed as membership in a particular kind of plural subject constituted, as are all plural subjects, by a joint commitment. \n\nOther topics Gilbert has addressed in one or more of her publications include agreements and promises, authority, collective emotions, collective responsibility, personal decisions and intentions, marital love, mutual recognition, patriotism, rights (in particular claim-rights), shared attention, shared values, social rules, and social unity.\n\nGilbert's essay collection \"Joint Commitment\" (2014) contains eighteen recent papers that together address most of the topics in the above list along with several others that Gilbert argues can be illuminated by an appeal to joint commitment.\n\n\n\n"}

The conference, in which the Marrakesh Declaration was signed, was called in response to the persecution of religious minorities, such as Christians and Yazidis, by ISIS. The Marrakesh Declaration builds on historical Islamic sources such as the Charter of Medina. King Mohammed VI of Morocco stated \"We in the kingdom of Morocco will not tolerate the violation of the rights of religious minorities in the name of Islam...I am enabling Christians and Jews to practice their faith and not just as minorities. They even serve in the government.\"\n\nThe declaration has been widely welcomed. Some commentators called for consistent legal and practical follow through of the sentiments expressed including in the country where the declaration was forged, which does not recognise its own indigenous Christians and persecutes and imprisons them, or in the birthplace of Islam, where there are reportedly many Saudi Christians.\n\n\n"}

In order for the International Criminal Court to take a case, the state must be a signed member of the Rome Statute, as this puts a country within the jurisdiction of the Court. However, if the perpetrator is tried at a National level court, the ICC does not handle the case.\n\n\"See also:\" \"Nuremberg trials\"\n\nPrior to the publication of the Rome Statute and the formation of the International Criminal Court, violators of the different Atrocity Crimes would be brought to justice through international tribunal, Nuremberg was the first such example of these tribunals.

Of the 24 Nazi officials charged, 16 of them were found guilty of Crimes Against Humanity.\n\n\"See also:\" \"ICTR\" & \"ICTY\"\n\nThe International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) is the United Nations court established in 1993 to prosecute atrocity crimes committed in the Balkans in the 1990s. It addresses crimes committed from 1991 to 2001 against members of various ethnic groups in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Kosovo and Macedonia. This was the first war crimes court established by the UN as well as the first international war crimes tribunal since the Nurenberg and Tokyo tribunals. It was established in accordance with Chapter VII of the UN Charter. The tribunal is located in The Hague, Netherlands. Since its inception, the ICTY has made precedent-setting decisions on atrocity crimes in that an individual's position does not protect them from prosecution. It has also set the precedent for individualized guilt in order to protect entire communities from being labelled \"collectively responsible.\" It has proven that the mass murder at Srebrenica was genocide as defined by international law. The ICTY has indicted over 160 individuals. It is still operating in full capacity.\n\nThe International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) is an international court established by the United Nations Security Council to prosecute individuals of genocide and other mass atrocity crimes committed in Rwanda and neighboring states between the dates of 1 January 1994 and 31 December 1994. The tribunal is located in Arusha, Tanzania. The ICTR is the first international tribunal to deliver verdicts of genocide and the first to interpret the definition of genocide.It is also the first tribunal to define rape as a means of committing genocide as well as to hold members of media responsible for broadcasts as a tool of genocide. The ICTR's last trial judgement was on 20 December 2012 and is currently only working on appeals. Since it opened in 1995, 93 individuals have been indicted by the ICTR, 61 have been found guilty of international humanitarian crimes and sentenced, 10 have been referred to national jurisdictions, 3 individuals died prior to verdicts, 3 fugitives have been referred to the MICT and 2 indictments were withdrawn before their trials started.\n\nAt the 2005 World Summit, the United Nations member states made a commitment to protect against genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against humanity (This document extended the definition of atrocity crimes to include ethnic cleansing). This document is not law, but rather holds all states responsible to protect their own populations from atrocity crimes and additionally holds the international community responsible for holding states' accountable for their populations. In accordance with Chapters VI, VII, and VIII of the Charter, the United Nations acknowledges its responsibility to help protect all populations through peaceful means, as well as through collective action when necessary.\n"}

NOIRs may be issued for immigrant visa petitions (such as Form I-130 and Form I-140) and for non-immigrant visa petitions (such as Form I-129 and Form I-129F).\n\nThe NOIR is sent to, and the response must be sent by, the petitioner (or an attorney representing the petitioner, if the petitioner is using an attorney) rather than the beneficiary. A copy may be sent to the beneficiary for information.\n\nIf the petitioner responds within the specified time, then the petitioner's response is considered when making a final decision on whether to revoke the petition. Otherwise, the petition is revoked once the specified time is over. An extension may be granted at the discretion of USCIS if the petitioner needs additional time to obtain documentation from abroad or for other meritorious reasons; however, the petitioner \"must\" respond in a timely manner to the NOIR by the stated deadline, and provide a reason for requesting the extra time.\n\nThe NOIR is generally issued when new evidence is presented to the USCIS suggesting that the petition was approved in error (i.e., it should not have been approved) \"or\" there has been a change in circumstances making the petition no longer approvable. The most common impetus for issuing a NOIR is that a consular officer (an employee of the United States Department of State) evaluating the beneficiary's visa application based on an approved petition comes across evidence suggesting that the petition should not have been approved, or is no longer approvable. The consular officer issues a Section 221(g) quasi-refusal to the visa applicant, and returns the petition to USCIS for revocation/revalidation, along with the reasons the consular officer believes the petition should not have been approved or is no longer approvable. Petitions relating to non-immigrant visas (such as Form I-129 and Form I-129F) are returned to the Kentucky Service Center whereas petitions related to immigrant visas (such as Form I-130 and Form I-140) are returned to the National Visa Center.\n\nThe returned petition is sent to the Service Center where the original petition was processed and a USCIS officer is assigned with the task of re-adjudicating the petition in light of the reasons for returning it. Information about the petition is updated in the USCIS system so that it is reflected in the Case Status Online as well as available to the National Customer Service Center. The petitioner is also notified of the petition being returned.\n\nAfter re-adjudicating the petition, the USCIS may either refuse to take any revocation action, issue a NOIR, or issue a Notice of Automatic Revocation. If the USCIS revalidates the petition (either directly, or after receiving additional information from the petitioner in response to the NOID), then the same visa application can be resumed with the new information.\n\nAfter receiving the response from the petitioner, the USCIS officer decides whether to revalidate the petition or revoke it. If the USCIS revokes the petition, the corresponding visa application is definitively denied. If the USCIS revalidates the petition, the information is sent back to the consular officer who should then continue processing the original visa application.\n\nIn 2007, Prakash Khatri, the USCIS ombudsman, sought comments from petitioners and beneficiaries on how to improve the system surrounding consular returns of petitions. The chief complaint by petitioners and beneficiaries was the lack of transparency about what was going on between the time the consular officer returned the petition to the USCIS and the USCIS issuing a NOIR, and this uncertainty often led to the filing of multiple duplicate petitions, thereby increasing costs for petitioners and creating an unnecessary caseload for the USCIS. The following recommendations were made:\n\n\nThere are two other kinds of communication that the USCIS uses for petitions: the Request For Evidence (RFE) and the Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID). The RFE and NOID differ from the NOIR in one important respect: the RFE and NOID are used for petitions still being adjudicated (i.e., ones that have not yet been approved) whereas the NOIR is used for petitions that have been approved.\n\nIn particular, even after the NOIR is issued, the corresponding petition is still considered approved right until the point when it is revoked.\n\nAnother difference between NOIRs and the other two is that there are no standard processing timelines for how much time it should take between receiving a returned petition and issuing a NOIR, but there are guidelines on standard processing times for the \"initial review\" that should end in approval, denial, RFE, or NOID.\n"}

{"id": "99404", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=99404", "title": "Peat", "text": "Peat\n\nPeat (), also known as turf (), is an accumulation of partially decayed vegetation or organic matter. It is unique to natural areas called peatlands, bogs, mires, moors, or muskegs. The peatland ecosystem is the most efficient carbon sink on the planet, because peatland plants capture CO naturally released from the peat, maintaining an equilibrium. In natural peatlands, the \"annual rate of biomass production is greater than the rate of decomposition\", but it takes \"thousands of years for peatlands to develop the deposits of , which is the average depth of the boreal [northern] peatlands\". \"Sphagnum\" moss, also called peat moss, is one of the most common components in peat, although many other plants can contribute. Soils consisting primarily of peat are known as histosols. Peat forms in wetland conditions, where flooding obstructs the flow of oxygen from the atmosphere, slowing the rate of decomposition.\n\nPeatlands, particularly bogs, are the primary source of peat,\nalthough less-common wetlands including fens, pocosins, and peat swamp forests also deposit peat. Landscapes covered in peat are home to specific kinds of plants including \"Sphagnum\" moss, ericaceous shrubs, and sedges (see bog for more information on this aspect of peat). Because organic matter accumulates over thousands of years, peat deposits provide records of past vegetation and climate by preserving plant remains, such as pollen. This allows humans to reconstruct past environments and study changes in human land use.\n\nPeat is harvested as an important source of fuel in certain parts of the world. By volume, there are about of peat in the world, covering a total of around 2% of the global land area (about ), containing about 8 billion terajoules of energy. Over time, the formation of peat is often the first step in the geological formation of other fossil fuels such as coal, particularly low-grade coal such as lignite.\n\nDepending on the agency, peat is not generally regarded as a renewable source of energy, due to its extraction rate in industrialized countries far exceeding its slow regrowth rate of 1mm per year, and as it is also reported that peat regrowth takes place only in 30-40% of peatlands. Because of this, the UNFCCC, and another organization affiliated with the United Nations classified peat as a fossil fuel. However, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has begun to classify peat as a \"slow-renewable\" fuel. This is also the classification used by many in the peat industry. At 106 g CO/MJ, the carbon dioxide emission intensity of peat is higher than that of coal (at 94.6 g CO/MJ) and natural gas (at 56.1) (IPCC).\n\nPeat forms when plant material does not fully decay in acidic and anaerobic conditions. It is composed mainly of wetland vegetation: principally bog plants including mosses, sedges, and shrubs. As it accumulates, the peat holds water. This slowly creates wetter conditions that allow the area of wetland to expand. Peatland features can include ponds, ridges, and raised bogs.\n\nMost modern peat bogs formed 12,000 years ago in high latitudes after the glaciers retreated at the end of the last ice age. Peat usually accumulates slowly at the rate of about a millimetre per year.\n\nPeat material is either fibric, hemic, or sapric. Fibric peats are the least decomposed and consist of intact fibre. Hemic peats are partially decomposed and sapric are the most decomposed.\n\n\"Phragmites\" peat are composed of reed grass, \"Phragmites australis\", and other grasses. It is denser than many other types of peat.\n\nEngineers may describe a soil as peat which has a relatively high percentage of organic material. This soil is problematic because it exhibits poor consolidation properties – it cannot be easily compacted to serve as a stable foundation to support loads, such as roads or buildings.\n\nIn a widely cited article, Joosten and Clarke (2002) defined peatlands or mires (which they claim are the same) as,\n\nPeatlands are areas of land with naturally formed layers of peat. They can be found in at least 175 countries and cover around 4 million square kilometres (1.5 million square miles); that is 3% of the world’s land area. In Europe, peatlands extend to about . About 60% of the world's wetlands are made of peat.\n\nPeat deposits are found in many places around the world, including northern Europe and North America. The North American peat deposits are principally found in Canada and the Northern United States. Some of the world's largest peatlands include the West Siberian Lowland, the Hudson Bay Lowlands, and the Mackenzie River Valley.\nThere is less peat in the Southern Hemisphere, in part because there is less land. That said, the vast Magellanic Moorland in South America (Southern Patagonia/Tierra del Fuego) is an extensive peat-dominated landscape. Peat can be found in New Zealand, Kerguelen, the Falkland Islands, and Indonesia (Kalimantan [Sungai Putri, Danau Siawan, Sungai Tolak], Rasau Jaya [West Kalimantan], and Sumatra). Indonesia has more tropical peatlands and mangrove forests than any other nation on earth, but Indonesia is losing wetlands by per year.\n\nAbout 7% of all peatlands have been exploited for agriculture and forestry. Under proper conditions, peat will turn into lignite coal over geologic periods of time.\n\nUnder pressure, water is forced out of peat, which is soft and easily compressed, and once dry can be used as fuel. In many countries, including Ireland and Scotland, peat has traditionally been used for cooking and domestic heating, and peat is stacked to dry in rural areas. It remains harvested on an industrial scale for this purpose in countries such as Ireland and Finland. Its insulating properties make it useful in industry.\n\nAlthough humans have many uses for peat, it presents severe problems at times. Wet or dry, it can be a major fire hazard. Peat fires may burn for great lengths of time, or smoulder underground and reignite after winter if an oxygen source is present. Because they are easily compressed under minimal weight, peat deposits pose major difficulties to builders of structures, roads, and railways. When the West Highland railway line was built across Rannoch Moor in western Scotland, its builders had to float the tracks on a multi-thousand-ton mattress of tree roots, brushwood, earth and ash.\n\nIn the Bronze and Iron Ages, people used peat bogs for rituals to nature gods and spirits. Bodies of the victims of such sacrifices have been found in various places in Scotland, England, Ireland, and especially northern Germany and Denmark. They are almost perfectly preserved by the tanning properties of the acidic water (see Tollund Man for one of the most famous examples of a bog body). Peat wetlands also used to have a degree of metallurgical importance, being during the Dark Ages the primary source of bog iron that was used to create swords and armour for Vikings. Many peat swamps along the coast of Malaysia serve as a natural means of flood mitigation, with any overflow being absorbed by the peat, provided forests are still present to prevent peat fires.\nThe climate, geography, and environment of Finland favours bog and peat bog formation. Thus, peat is available in considerable quantities. This abundant resource (often mixed with wood at an average of 2.6%) is burned to produce heat and electricity. Peat provides around 6.2% of Finland's annual energy production, second only to Ireland. The contribution of peat to greenhouse gas emissions of Finland can exceed 10 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide per year – equal to the total emissions of all passenger-car traffic in Finland.\n\nFinland classifies peat as a slowly renewing biomass fuel. Peat producers in Finland often claim that peat is a special form of biofuel because of the relatively fast retake rate of released CO if the bog is not forested for the following 100 years. Also, agricultural and forestry-drained peat bogs actively release more CO annually than is released in peat energy production in Finland. The average regrowth rate of a single peat bog, however, is indeed slow, from 1,000 up to 5,000 years. Furthermore, it is a common practice to forest used peat bogs instead of giving them a chance to renew. This leads to lower levels of CO storage than the original peat bog.\n\nAt 106 g CO/MJ, the carbon dioxide emissions of peat are higher than those of coal (at 94.6 g CO/MJ) and natural gas (at 56.1). According to one study, increasing the average amount of wood in the fuel mixture from the current 2.6% to 12.5% would take the emissions down to 93 g CO/MJ. That said, little effort is being made to achieve this.\n\nPeat extraction is also seen by some conservationists as the main threat to mire biodiversity in Finland. The International Mire Conservation Group (IMCG) in 2006 urged the local and national governments of Finland to protect and conserve the remaining pristine peatland ecosystems. This includes the cessation of drainage and peat extraction in intact mire sites and the abandoning of current and planned groundwater extraction that may affect these sites. A proposal for a Finnish peatland management strategy was presented to the government in 2011, after a lengthy consultation phase.\n\nIn Ireland, large-scale domestic and industrial peat usage is widespread. In the Republic of Ireland, a state-owned company called is responsible for managing peat extraction. It processes the extracted peat into milled peat which is used in power stations and sells processed peat fuel in the form of peat briquettes which are used for domestic heating. These are oblong bars of densely compressed, dried, and shredded peat. Peat moss is a manufactured product for use in garden cultivation. Turf (dried out peat sods) is also commonly used in rural areas.\n\nUse of peat for energy production was prominent in the Soviet Union, especially in 1965. In 1929, over 40% of the Soviet Union's electric energy came from peat, which dropped to 1% by 1980.\nIn the 1960s, larger sections of swamps and bogs in Western Russia were drained for agricultural and mining purposes. Plans are underway to increase peat output and increase peat's contribution to Russian energy generation. There is concern about the environmental impact as peat fields are flammable, drainage degrades ecosystems, and burning of peat releases carbon dioxide. Due to 2010 forest and peat fires, the Russian government is under heavy pressure to finance re-flooding of the previously drained bogs around Moscow. The initial costs for the programme are estimated to be about 20 to 25 billion rubles; that is close to 500 million euros (540 million USD).\n\nCurrently, Russia is responsible for 17% of the world's peat production and 20% of that peat (1.5 million tons) is used for energy purposes. Shatura Power Station in Moscow Oblast and Kirov Power Station in Kirov Oblast are the two largest peat power stations in the world.\n\n2500 years BP the area now named the Netherlands was largely covered with peat. Drainage, causing compaction and oxidation and excavation have reduced peatlands to about or 10% of the land area, mostly used as meadows. Drainage and excavation have lowered the surface of the peatlands. In the west of the country dikes and mills were built, creating polders so that dwelling and economic activities could continue below sea level. The first polder was in the 11th century, and the last in 1968. Harvesting of peat could continue in suitable locations as the lower peat layers below current sea level became exposed. They were deposited before the rise of the sea level in the Holocene. As a result approximate 26% of its area and 21% of its population of the Netherlands are presently below sea level. The deepest point is in the Zuidplaspolder, below average sea level. \n\nThe extraction of peat from the Somerset Levels began during the Roman times and has been carried out since the Levels were first drained. On Dartmoor, there were several commercial distillation plants formed and run by the British Patent Naphtha Company in 1844. These produced naphtha on a commercial scale from the high-quality local peat.\n\nFenn's, Whixall and Bettisfield Mosses is an element of a post-Ice Age peat bog that straddles the England–Wales border and contains many rare plant and animal species due to the acidic environment created by the peat. Only lightly hand-dug, it is now a national nature reserve and is being restored to its natural condition.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, there is small-scale domestic turf cutting in rural areas, but areas of bogs have been diminished because of changes in agriculture. In response, afforestation has seen the establishment of tentative steps towards conservation such as Peatlands Park, County Armagh which is an Area of Special Scientific Interest.\n\nSome Scotch whisky distilleries, such as those on Islay, use peat fires to dry malted barley. The drying process takes about 30 hours. This gives the whiskies a distinctive smoky flavour, often called \"peatiness\".\nThe peatiness, or degree of peat flavour, of a whisky, is calculated in ppm of phenol. Normal Highland whiskies have a peat level of up to 30 ppm, and the whiskies on Islay usually have up to 50 ppm. In rare types like the Octomore, the whisky can have more than 100 ppm of phenol. Scotch Ales can also use peat roasted malt, imparting a similar smoked flavor.\n\nIn Sweden, farmers use dried peat to absorb excrement from cattle that are wintered indoors. The most important property of peat is retaining moisture in container soil when it is dry while preventing the excess of water from killing roots when it is wet. Peat can store nutrients although it is not fertile itself – it is polyelectrolytic with a high ion-exchange capacity due to its oxidized lignin. Peat is discouraged as a soil amendment by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, England, since 2003. While bark-based peat-free potting soil mixes are on the rise, particularly in the U.K., peat remains an important raw material for horticulture in Canada, as well as parts of the United States. However, it is recommended to treat peat thermally, e.g., through soil steaming in order to kill pests and reactivate nutrients.\n\nPeat is sometimes used in freshwater aquaria. It is seen most commonly in soft water or blackwater river systems such as those mimicking the Amazon River basin. In addition to being soft in texture and therefore suitable for demersal (bottom-dwelling) species such as \"Corydoras\" catfish, peat is reported to have a number of other beneficial functions in freshwater aquaria. It softens water by acting as an ion exchanger; it also contains substances that are beneficial for plants, and for the reproductive health of fishes. Peat can prevent algae growth and kill microorganisms. Peat often stains the water yellow or brown due to the leaching of tannins.\n\nPeat is used in water filtration, such as for the treatment of septic tank effluent and for urban runoff.\n\nPeat is widely used in balneotherapy (the use of bathing to treat disease). Many traditional spa treatments include peat as part of peloids. Such health treatments have an enduring tradition in European countries including Poland, the Czech Republic, Germany, and Austria. Some of these old spas date back to the 18th century and are still active today. The most common types of peat application in balneotherapy are peat muds, poultices, and suspension baths.\n\nAuthors Rydin and Jeglum in \"Biology of Habitats\" described the concept of peat archives, a phrase coined by influential peatland scientist Harry Godwin in 1981.\n\nIn \"Quaternary Palaeoecology\", first published in 1980, Birks and Birks described how paleoecological studies \"of peat can be used to reveal what plant communities were present (locally and regionally), what time period each community occupied, how environmental conditions changed, and how the environment affected the ecosystem in that time and place.\"\n\nScientists continue to compare modern mercury (Hg) accumulation rates in bogs with historical natural-archives records in peat bogs and lake sediments to estimate the potential human impacts on the biogeochemical cycle of mercury, for example. Over the years, different dating models and technologies for measuring date sediments and peat profiles accumulated over the last 100–150 years, have been used, including the widely used vertical distribution of 210Pb, the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-SMS), and more recently the initial penetration (IP).\nPeat \"hags\" are a form of erosion that occurs at the sides of gullies that cut into the peat or, sometimes, in isolation. Hags may result when flowing water cuts downwards into the peat and when fire or overgrazing exposes the peat surface. Once the peat is exposed in these ways, it is prone to further erosion by wind, water, and livestock. The result is overhanging vegetation and peat. Hags are too steep and unstable for vegetation to establish itself, so they continue to erode unless restorative action is taken.\nThe distinctive ecological conditions of peat wetlands provide a habitat for distinctive fauna and flora. For example, whooping cranes nest in North American peatlands, while Siberian cranes nest in the West Siberian peatland. Such habitats also have many species of wild orchids and carnivorous plants. It takes centuries for a peat bog to recover from disturbance. (For more on biological communities, see wetland, bog or fen.)\n\nThe world's largest peat bog is located in Western Siberia. It is the size of France and Germany combined. Recent studies show that it is thawing for the first time in 11,000 years. As the permafrost melts, it could release billions of tonnes of methane gas into the atmosphere. The world's peatlands are thought to contain 180 to 455 billion metric tonnes of sequestered carbon, and they release into the atmosphere 20 to 45 million metric tons of methane annually. The peatlands' contribution to long-term fluctuations in these atmospheric gases has been a matter of considerable debate.\n\nOne of the characteristics for peat is the bioaccumulations of metals often concentrated in the peat. Accumulated mercury is of significant environmental concern.\n\nLarge areas of organic wetland (peat) soils are currently drained for agriculture, forestry, and peat extraction. This process is taking place all over the world. This not only destroys the habitat of many species but also heavily fuels climate change. As a result of peat drainage, the organic carbon – which built over thousands of years and is normally underwater – is suddenly exposed to the air. It decomposes and turns into carbon dioxide (), which is released into the atmosphere. The global emissions from drained peatlands have increased from 1,058 Mton in 1990 to 1,298 Mton in 2008 (a 20% increase). This increase has particularly taken place in developing countries, of which Indonesia, China, Malaysia, and Papua New Guinea are the fastest-growing top emitters. This estimate excludes emissions from peat fires (conservative estimates amount to at least 4,000 Mton/-eq./yr for south-east Asia). With 174 Mton/-eq./yr the EU is after Indonesia (500 Mton) and before Russia (161 Mton) the world's second-largest emitter of drainage-related peatland (excl. extracted peat and fires). Total emissions from the worldwide 500,000 km of degraded peatland may exceed 2.0 Gtons (including emissions from peat fires) which is almost 6% of all global carbon emissions.\n\nPeat has a high carbon content and can burn under low moisture conditions. Once ignited by the presence of a heat source (e.g., a wildfire penetrating the subsurface), it smoulders. These smouldering fires can burn undetected for very long periods of time (months, years, and even centuries) propagating in a creeping fashion through the underground peat layer.\n\nDespite the damage that the burning of raw peat can cause, bogs are naturally subject to wildfires and depend on the wildfires to keep woody competition from lowering the water table and shading out many bog plants. Several families of plants including the carnivorous \"Sarracenia\" (trumpet pitcher), \"Dionaea\" (Venus flytrap), \"Utricularia\" (bladderworts) and non-carnivorous plants such as the sandhills lily, toothache grass and many species of orchid are now threatened and in some cases endangered from the combined forces of human drainage, negligence, and absence of fire.\n\nThe recent burning of peat bogs in Indonesia, with their large and deep growths containing more than 50 billion tonnes of carbon, has contributed to increases in world carbon dioxide levels. Peat deposits in Southeast Asia could be destroyed by 2040.\n\nIt is estimated that in 1997, peat and forest fires in Indonesia released between 0.81 and 2.57 Gt of carbon; equivalent to 13–40 percent of the amount released by global fossil fuel burning, and greater than the carbon uptake of the world's biosphere. These fires may be responsible for the acceleration in the increase in carbon dioxide levels since 1998. More than 100 peat fires in Kalimantan and East Sumatra have continued to burn since 1997; each year, these peat fires ignite new forest fires above the ground.\n\nIn North America, peat fires can occur during severe droughts throughout their occurrence, from boreal forests in Canada to swamps and fens in the subtropical southern Florida Everglades. Once a fire has burnt through the area, hollows in the peat are burnt out, and hummocks are desiccated but can contribute to \"Sphagnum\" recolonization.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, an unusually high heat wave of up to ignited large deposits of peat in Central Russia, burning thousands of houses and covering the capital of Moscow with a toxic smoke blanket. The situation remained critical until the end of August 2010.\n\nIn June 2002, the United Nations Development Programme launched the Wetlands Ecosystem and Tropical Peat Swamp Forest Rehabilitation Project. This project was targeted to last for 5 years, and brings together the efforts of various non-government organisations.\n\nIn November 2002, the International Peatland (formerly Peat) Society (IPS) and the International Mire Conservation Group (IMCG) published guidelines on the \"Wise Use of Mires and Peatlands – Backgrounds and Principles including a framework for decision-making\". The aim of this publication is to develop mechanisms that can balance the conflicting demands on the global peatland heritage, to ensure its wise use to meet the needs of humankind.\n\nIn June 2008, the IPS published the book \"Peatlands and Climate Change\", summarising the currently available knowledge on the topic. In 2010, IPS presented a \"Strategy for Responsible Peatland Management\", which can be applied worldwide for decision-making.\n\n"}

It was enacted into legislation in 1935 by the government of the Republic of China. After the Chinese Civil War, the People's Republic of China in 1951 continued with developing the Public Notary system. The Central People's Government of the PRC or commonly refer to as the State Council took on the administration of the Public Notary system. It created many offices in provincial counties and towns to make it accessible to the common people.\n\nDuring the period between 1958 and 1959, the Public Notary system languished and due to Cultural Revolution it virtually came to a standstill for the next two decades. The Cultural Revolution expelled the bourgeoisie and capitalist, nationalizing private property, private ownership of businesses and land were prohibited and turn into collective public ownership. This reduced the demand for notarization of documents and legal services.\n\nIt was not until 1978 with the central government embarking on market economic reforms that the Public Notary system became very important and relevant. In 1979, the Central People's Government enacting legislation for Public Notary Offices to be set up in all the Municipalities, provincial cities, prefecture level cities and towns. By some measure in 1979 there was a 15 fold increase in notarization services as compared to 1977. In 1982, all the laws and regulations for Public Notary system was in place. This increased the effectiveness of the system as well as supported China's experiment with market economic reforms.\n\nMinistry of Justice of the People's Republic of China\n\n"}

It is intended to prevent various economic and public accommodation-related acts of discrimination against people based on their sexual orientation, gender identity or expression. The bill \"does not\" affects religious beliefs, \"does not\" oppress other people’s rights as it is an anti-oppression bill, and \"does not\" legalize same-sex marriages.\n\nThe bill was first filed in Congress in 2000 by then-senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago and then-Akbayan party-list Representative Etta Rosales, in which the bill passed 3rd reading in the House but stalled in the Senate due to extreme-right conservative senators. Similar measures were filed by other senators in the 15th and 16th congresses which failed to see progress. The bill was re-filed by Defensor-Santiago in every congressional period in the Senate until the end of her last term in 2016. The counterpart bill in the House was also filed continuously by the representatives of Akbayan party-list.\n\nIn 2017, the House bill (No. 4982), as filed in 2016 by Reps. Kaka Bag-ao and Geraldine Roman (and merged from multiple similar bills), passed 3rd reading for the first time since 2001 with 198 members of the House of Representatives voting for the bill and none opposing it. \n\nThe counterpart bill in the Senate, filed by Senator Risa Hontiveros (the first Akbayan senator), was in the period of interpolations by May 2018. It is backed by Senators Loren Legarda, Grace Poe, Nancy Binay, Franklin Drilon, Bam Aquino, Chiz Escudero, Ralph Recto, Sonny Angara, JV Ejercito, Francis Pangilinan, Juan Miguel Zubiri, and Leila de Lima, although de Lima is barred from voting on the bill as she is currently in police custody. It was opposed by Senators Tito Sotto, Manny Pacquiao, and Joel Villanueva. Ironically, Villanueva has signed up as a 'co-author' of the bill he opposes. Other senators such as Win Gatchalian, Cynthia Villar, Koko Pimentel, Antonio Trillanes, Panfilo Lacson, and Richard J. Gordon have not yet expressed their support or rejection of the bill, while Alan Peter Cayetano and Gregorio Honasan no longer have voting rights on Senate measures as they resigned to be part of the presidential cabinet. All in all, out of the existing 24 Senate seats: 12 seats support and can vote on the bill; 1 seat supports but cannot vote on the bill; 3 seats oppose and can vote on the bill; 6 seats can vote on the bill but have not yet given their positions on it; and 2 seats are \"de facto\" vacated. For a bill to pass the Senate, it needs a vote of 50% (12) of the body, plus one (1) vote for a total of thirteen (13) votes. The SOGIE Equality Bill currently is supported by 12 seats that are \"allowed to vote\" on the measure.\n\nThe bill is also supported by the student governments of University of the Philippines-Diliman (UPD, Ateneo de Manila University (ADMU), De La Salle University(DLSU)-Manila, De La Salle - College of St. Benilde (CSB), Far Eastern University (FEU), Miriam College (MC), St. Scholastica’s College (SSC)-Manila and San Beda University (SBU).

The plant operated until 1945 when production wound down. Also built adjacent was the Marion Engineering Depot which was authorized in the summer of 1942. Land for the plant was taken in Grand Prairie, Scott, Clairdon and Marion Townships in an area covering .\n\nFamilies who owned property within the zone identified for the facility were notified March 2, 1942 that they had to vacate their land by May 1, 1942. Not only did this mean that the displaced had to find a place to live in the midst of a housing and fuel shortage, but it also meant moving and/or selling livestock and agricultural equipment. Federal contractors began removing field fencing in April 1942. While land owners received a \"fair\" valuation for their property, relocation expenses were not paid. Several property owners claimed that they never received any compensation from the government.\n\nAfter May 1, 1942, most of the farmsteads located inside the perimeter were leveled; underground bunkers and production buildings were built in clusters throughout the SOP site. By June 1942 SOP was employing 2,900 employees, many of whom moved north from Southern Ohio and Kentucky for the high paying wages offered.\n\nOnce in operation, the plant (under the operation of U.S. Rubber) produced fuses and boosters, 20 mm bullets, 50 caliber bullets, 50 caliber artillery shells, 65 mm shells and 75 mm shells. Incendiary bombs and napalm barrel bombs, similar to those used on Dresden by Allied forces were also produced at the site. Munitions containers served duel duty by carrying SOP products overseas, and then doubling as coffins for those killed in action.\n\nGerman Prisoners of War were housed on the site (in an area referred to as “Camp Marion”) beginning in December 1944.\n\nFollowing the end of the war, land taken for SOP was resold to civilians. Local farmers who had lost their land had first option to repurchase their former lands back from the government. Land that was not purchased back by displaced residents was then sold to other buyers. A housing development - Grandview - was built over the magazine area of the former plant.\n\nIn 1949, Uranium handling was planned for the site, with the contract going to Monsanto Company. However production at the facility never began in earnest.\n\nIn 2000 it was revealed that students attending River Valley High School (Caledonia, Ohio), built on land formerly occupied by the Marion Engineering Depot, had higher than usual instances leukemia. Tests performed on the site by the Ohio EPA and the United States Army Corps of Engineers proved inconclusive. A private consultant hired by a parents organization found evidence of toxic chemical waste on the River Valley site dating back to the 1940s. As a result, these findings, and because of Ohio EPA problems with investigation, River Valley pursued building a new school campus and eventually abandoned the Engineering Depot Site.\n\nToday, most of the buildings have been demolished, or are being used by the private farmers who now own the land. A few buildings are visible today, and can be seen from New Road (which runs north-south parallel to Pole Lane Rd). During the 1990s, at the height of the investigation into the health issues which many residents attributed to the ordnance plant, there were rows and rows of 50 gallon drums sealed and seemingly ready for disposal located in a field a few hundred yards west of New Road. Most assumed this was waste that the Army Corps of Engineers had collected and planned to dispose of. The chapel for the base still exists, although it is unused. It is located at the corner of Pole Lane Rd and Likens Rd. At one point it was inhabited as a residence, but has been unused and abandoned for many years. In the neighborhood of Grandview, which is north from the chapel and west off of Pole Lane Rd, there are still remnants of the plant. In some of the undeveloped areas of the neighborhood in the woods, you can still find large flat overgrown slabs of concrete platforms, large concrete sidewalks, all of which now are on private property. This can also be seen in the fields west of Pole Lane Rd. There are concrete roads which were most likely used for vehicles. The Marion International Airport is also located on Pole Lane Rd. For years many pilots had reported that during the winter as they flew over the area they could see a large square patch of land where the snow would melt in an exact square, while the rest of the land surrounded it remained covered in snow. It was later discovered that this area of land was where the Army had dug and buried chemicals used in ammunition production (phosphorus etc.), and as the chemicals mixed with the oxygen in the ground it would melt the snow that settled on it. Directly across the road from the church at Pole Land and Likens is a crumbled concrete platform. It is roughly 12' square, and all that is left is about 2' high of concrete and several pieces of steel rusted re-bar. This structure was originally a guard tower used for observation when German prisoners were held at the camp. During the 1940s, many of the German prisoners were used as labor in the city of Marion. Local residents who were alive at the time can recall the prisoners being used for painting, maintenance, collecting trash, building improvements, etc. Although they were POW's, they were treated well and fairly by the Army.\n\nMost of the physical history of this area of Marion is gone, except for the church, a few buildings, and the Marion Depot located on Rt 309, which still houses an Army station and a train loading-unloading station (the Army reserve HQ previously located at the corner of Pole Lane Rd and Rt 309 has subsequently closed also). The memories of the history of this area still live strong considering this has been a part of history in Marion Ohio for nearly 70 years.\n\n\nMosher, Charles D., Mosher, Delpha Ruth. \"The Scioto Ordnance Plant and the marion Engineering Depot of Marion, Ohio, A Profile After Forty years.\" Published by Authors with Assistance from the Marion County Historical Society. 1987.\n"}

For instance, a manufacturer of consumer electronics might have a vertical agreement with a retailer according to which the latter would promote their products in return for lower prices. Franchising is a form of vertical agreement, and under European Union competition law this falls within the scope of Article 101.\n\nWhether a vertical agreement actually restricts competition and whether in that case the benefits outweigh the anti-competitive effects will often depend on the market structure.\n\nVertical agreements that fulfil the conditions for exemption and do not contain any so-called \"hardcore restrictions\" of competition are exempted from the prohibition in Article 101(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union by Regulation 330/2010 \n. The main exception is agreements for motor vehicle distribution, which remain subject to Regulation 1400/2002 until 31 May 2013, pursuant to a three-year extension granted in Regulation 461/2010. Although this latter regulation applies Regulation 330/2010 to agreements for the repair of motor vehicles and for the distribution of spare parts as of 1 June 2013, it also supplements Regulation 330 with three additional \"hardcore\" clauses\n\n"}
{"id": "1853177", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1853177", "title": "World Book Day", "text": "World Book Day\n\nWorld Book Day or World Book and Copyright Day (also known as International Day of the Book or World Book Days) is a yearly event on April 23rd, organized by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), to promote reading, publishing and copyright. In the United Kingdom, the day is recognized on the first Thursday in March. World Book Day was celebrated for the first time on 23 April 1995.\n\nThe original idea was of the Valencian writer Vicente Clavel Andrés as a way to honour the author Miguel de Cervantes, first on 7 October, his birth date, then on 23 April, his death date. In 1995 UNESCO decided that the World Book and Copyright Day would be celebrated on 23 April, as the date is also the anniversary of the death of William Shakespeare and Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, as well as that of the birth or death of several other prominent authors. (In a historical coincidence, Shakespeare and Cervantes died on the same \"date\" — 23 April 1616 — but not on the same \"day\", as at the time, Spain used the Gregorian calendar and England used the Julian calendar; Shakespeare actually died 10 days after Cervantes died, on 3 May of the Gregorian calendar.)\n\nBook Day is 23 April, the anniversary of Cervantes death, \"Don Quixote\" is read during a two-day \"readathon\" and the Miguel de Cervantes Prize is presented by the Spanish king in Alcalá de Henares. \n\nIn Catalonia, Spain, St. George's Day has been 'The Day of the Rose' since 1436, and involves the exchange of gifts between loved ones and respected people—it is analogous to Valentine's Day. Although World Book and Copyright Day has been celebrated since 1995 internationally, books were exchanged on 'The Day of the Rose' in Catalonia since 1929, in memory of Cervantes.\n\nIn Sweden, the day is known as \"Världsbokdagen\" (\"World Book Day\") and the copyright aspect is seldom mentioned. Normally celebrated on 23 April, it was moved to 13 April in the year 2000 and 2011 to avoid a clash with Easter.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, World Book Day is held annually on the first Thursday in March, as 23 April sometimes clashes with Easter school holidays; 23 April is also the National Saint's Day of England, St George's Day. A separate event, World Book Night, organized by independent charity The Reading Agency, is held on 23 April.\n\nIn Kensington, Maryland the International Day of the Book is celebrated with a street festival on the Sunday closest to 26 April.\n\n\n"}
