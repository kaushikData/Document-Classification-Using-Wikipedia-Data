Schundler\n\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey v. Schundler, 168 F.3d 92 (3rd Cir. 1999) is a United States federal case establishing standards for a government-sponsored holiday display to contain religious symbols. It was decided by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit on February 16, 1999.\n\nDuring the holiday season, Jersey City, New Jersey erected a nativity scene, a Christmas tree and a menorah on city property in front of City Hall. The scene included Mary, Joseph, Baby Jesus and the Three Wisemen. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) asked the city to stop putting religious symbols on public property. Jersey City put up a sign next to the display that read \"Through this display and others throughout the year, the City of Jersey City is pleased to celebrate the diverse cultural and ethnic heritages of its peoples.\" The ACLU filed a lawsuit saying that this display was unconstitutional because it violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The Federal District Court of New Jersey ordered the city to stop erecting its holiday display. The City decided to appeal this ruling. The City also erected a modified holiday display with the original menorah, Christmas tree and nativity and the City added a Santa Claus, Frosty the Snowman, a sled, Kwanzaa symbols on the tree and two signs. The ACLU filed for contempt. After some back and forth with the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, the District Court ruled that the modified display did not violate the First Amendment.\n\nThe majority opinion of the court was written by Circuit Judge Samuel Alito. The Court used the test for the Establishment Clause from \"Lemon v. Kurtzman\". This test looks at \"whether a challenged government practice had a secular purpose, whether its principal or primary effect advanced or inhibited religion, and whether it created an excessive entanglement of the government with religion.\" The Court also relied on two prior Supreme Court cases \"Lynch v. Donnelly\" and \"County of Allegheny v. ACLU\". The Court stated that \"we are unable to perceive any meaningful constitutional distinction between the display at issue here and those that the Supreme Court upheld in \"Lynch\" and \"Allegheny County\".\" \"None of these displays conveyed a message of government endorsement of Christianity, Judaism, or of religion in general but instead 'sent a message of pluralism and freedom to choose one's own beliefs.\" The Court decided that the modified display did not violate the First Amendment.\n\n"}

According to , members of the Boards of Appeal may only be removed from office by the Administrative Council on a proposal from the Enlarged Board of Appeal. Two cases were successively initiated by the Administrative Council, but the Enlarged Board eventually dismissed both of them. In the third case initiated by the Administrative Council, the Enlarged Board decided not to propose the removal from office of Corcoran.\n\nThe European Patent Convention (EPC) is a multilateral treaty instituting the legal system according to which European patents are granted. It contains provisions allowing a party to appeal a decision issued by a first instance department of the European Patent Office (EPO). The appeal procedure is under the responsibility of its Boards of Appeal, which are institutionally independent within the EPO. According to Robin Jacob, the members of the Boards of Appeal are \"judges in all but name\".\n\nThe members of the Boards of Appeal are appointed by the Administrative Council of the European Patent Organisation on a proposal from the President of the European Patent Office (EPO). The Administrative Council exercises disciplinary authority over the Board members and, during their five-year term, the Board members may only be removed from office \"if there are serious grounds for such removal and if the Administrative Council, on a proposal from the Enlarged Board of Appeal, takes a decision to this effect.\" The Administrative Council is also the appointing and disciplinary authority for the President of the EPO.\n\nFurther, employees of the EPO, no matter whether they are members of the Boards of Appeal, may apply to the Administrative Tribunal of the International Labour Organization (ILO) to resolve employment disputes they may have with the European Patent Organisation.\n\nOn 3 December 2014, Patrick Corcoran, an Irish member of Board of Appeal 3.5.05, \"was escorted out of the [European Patent] Office by [EPO's] investigation unit,\" and Benoît Battistelli, president of the EPO, imposed a \"house ban\" on him. In reaction, a number of members of the Enlarged Board of Appeal, the highest body of the EPO judiciary, wrote to the Administrative Council to express their concerns over this move, regarded as challenging the judicial independence of the Boards of Appeal. Battistelli stated that he acted \"in accordance with the rules at all times\" and that he was \"absolutely committed to the independence of the [EPO's] judiciary\".\n\nThe Administrative Council of the European Patent Organisation then suspended Corcoran. The decision was taken at the Administrative Council's meeting held on 10 and 11 December 2014 in Munich, Germany. The suspension is unique in the history of the EPO. Corcoran was originally suspended until 31 March 2015, for alleged misconduct \"[a]s a precautionary and conservative measure\" pending an investigation of the matter. According to the French newspaper \"Les Échos\", Corcoran was accused of having launched a smear campaign against Željko Topić, one of the Vice-Presidents of the EPO. \"The Irish Times\" later reported that Corcoran had been suspended for defamatory statements he allegedly made against Battistelli using a pseudonym, and for bringing \"weapons and Nazi memorabilia to work\".\n\nAfter the suspension of Corcoran, the Rules of Procedure of the Enlarged Board of Appeal (RPEBA) were amended by decision of 25 March 2015 (CA/D 3/15) to implement a procedure for Article 23(1) proceedings,<ref name=\"CA/D 3/15\"></ref> and to fill a legislative lacuna in that respect. A new Article 12a RPEBA provides for that the Administrative Council or the Vice President of EPO in charge of the Boards of Appeal may request that the Enlarged Board of Appeal make a proposal to the Administrative Council for the removal from office of a Board member.\n\nFollowing an internal investigation, the Administrative Council requested on 25 June 2015 the Enlarged Board of Appeal to make a proposal for the removal from office of Corcoran, pursuant to and Article 12a of the Rules of Procedure of the Enlarged Board of Appeal. This was the first dismissal procedure instituted against a member of the Boards of Appeal in the history of the European Patent Office.\n\nIn that first case, which received the case number \"Art. 23 1/15\" (also referred to as \"G 2301/15\"), the Administrative Council sent data which it said were sufficient evidence. In its decision issued in September 2015, the Enlarged Board indicated that the Council however failed to make a statement regarding the facts which should lead to removal from office, or give arguments why the evidence should lead to removal. The Enlarged Board thus dismissed the case. Namely, the Administrative Council's request for a proposal that Corcoran be removed from office was rejected as inadmissible.\n\nA second case, which received the case number \"Art. 23 2/15\" (also referred to as \"G 2302/15\"), was then initiated on 26 October 2015 and subsequently withdrawn by the Administrative Council. The Enlarged Board thus dismissed the case. It also ordered publication of the decision and proposed reimbursement of legal costs by the defendant.\n\nA third case, which received case number \"Art. 23 1/16\" (also referred to as \"G 2301/16\"), contained a redrafted request from the Administrative Council asking for a proposal for the removal of Corcoran. During first non-public oral proceedings held on 10 to 12 May 2016, the Enlarged Board of Appeal held that the Administrative Council's request was formally admissible for discussion as to its merits, unlike the first request filed in case Art. 23 1/15. The Enlarged Board also decided that public oral proceedings would be held in June 2016, in order to discuss the merits of the case. However, shortly before the scheduled oral proceedings, the Enlarged Board received a letter from the president of the EPO, who was not a party to the proceedings, indicating that he considered the planned public oral hearing and the hearing of witnesses from the Office as \"unlawful\". Following this intervention from the president of the EPO, the Enlarged Board considered that it could only proceed further with the proceedings if the chairman of the Administrative Council (the \"petitioner\" that started the proceedings, and appointing authority of the president) distanced himself from the letter. The Administrative Council replied, but the Enlarged Board deemed that the Administrative Council did not do so satisfactorily. The Board thus decided not to request removal from office of the defendant, i.e. Corcoran, without deciding on the substantive allegations made against him.\n\nIn 2017, the Administrative Council did not renew Corcoran's term of office. \n\nOn 6 December 2017, the Administrative Tribunal of the International Labour Organization (ILO) issued two decisions, i.e. judgments 3958 and 3960, in which the Tribunal largely sided with Corcoran in ordering his immediate reinstatement in his position as well as monetary compensations to be paid to cover lost wages, legal costs and “moral damages”. Corcoran had filed complaints with the ILO Administrative Tribunal against his suspension. The Tribunal held that Battistelli, the President of the EPO, should not have played a decisive role in the suspension proceedings since he was the subject of the alleged defamation by Corcoran. That is, the Tribunal held that Battistelli had acted in a partial manner, had a conflict of interest, and \"had improperly involved himself in the decision to suspend [Corcoran]\".\n\nThe \"house ban\" issued in December 2014 was later lifted on 11 December 2017, and Corcoran resumed his work as member of the Boards of Appeal. However, as his five-year term as member of the Boards of Appeal was not renewed by the Administrative Council, he returned to work at the EPO first-instance departments in January 2018. He was then reportedly transferred from Munich, Germany, to the EPO branch in The Hague, Netherlands, and assigned to a position outside his area of expertise. In the meantime, the Administrative Tribunal of the International Labour Organization (ILO) issued two further decisions, i.e. judgments 3959 and 3961, dismissing Corcoran's complaints relating to the confiscation of his USB memory stick by the EPO Investigative Unit on 3 December 2014, and to his \"request that the Administrative Council [of the European Patent Organisation] investigate the alleged unauthorized disclosure of confidential information relating to the ongoing disciplinary procedure against him\".\n\nIn 2018, it was revealed that Benoît Battistelli, then President of the EPO, and Željko Topić, one of EPO Vice-Presidents, had initiated criminal proceedings against Corcoran before courts in Munich. These proceedings eventually resulted in the Regional Court I of Munich () declaring in November 2017, on appeal, Corcoran innocent of all charges, including the alleged defamation.\n\nIn October 2015, Siegfried Broß, a former judge of the German Federal Constitutional Court and the Patent Division of the Federal Court of Justice, expressed the opinion that the procedure followed by the President and the Administrative Council did not comply with the rule of law and had been conducted in a manner comparable to criminal proceedings, and that confidentiality requirements had not been adhered to. He furthermore criticized the role of EPO's internal investigation unit. EPO Vice-President Raimund Lutz strongly rejected these criticisms, stating that the disciplinary proceedings against the Board member were conducted by the EPO and the Administrative Council in accordance with the EPC provisions.\n\nThe case has fueled the discussion about the lack of sufficient independence of the Boards of Appeal from the executive branch of the European Patent Office, and the shortcomings of the Administrative Tribunal of the International Labour Organization (ILO) in effectively resolving employment disputes within the EPO. It has also been cited as an example of what can go wrong in supranational organizations.\n\n\n"}

The ban came into effect on 1 January 2012. The last bullfight in the region took place in Barcelona in September 2011.\n\nThe ban, which ended a centuries-old tradition in the region, was supported by animal rights activists but opposed by some, who saw it as motivated by political nationalism rather than animal welfare.\n\nThere is a movement to revoke the ban in the Spanish congress, citing the value of bullfighting as \"cultural heritage.\" The proposal is backed by the majority of parliamentarians. The ban was officially annulled for being unconstitutional by Spain's highest court on 5 October 2016.\n\nThe earliest recorded fight in Catalonia took place in 1387, although, as elsewhere in Spain, it was not until the early 19th century that bullfighting in the region took its form as a modern spectator sport. By the early 20th century, it had become one of the major entertainment attractions in Catalonia. The region still preserves some of the oldest bullrings in Spain, such as the \"Plaça Clarà\" in Olot (built in 1859), and the bullring in Figueres (1894). The 1897 bullring in Girona was demolished in 2006.\n\nThe sport declined in popularity in recent decades. By 2011, the only operating bullring in Catalonia was La Monumental in Barcelona, where 20 fights were organized in 2009. This compares to 284 fights organized in the Community of Madrid (with a similar population to Catalonia). Nine fights were organized between April and July 2010. Organizers say that average attendance is around 7,000 people, of whom 400 are season ticket holders.\n\nA ban on bullfighting in Catalonia was approved by the Catalan Parliament on 28 July 2010, following a petition (or Popular Legislative Initiative, PLI) organised by the PROU platform (Catalan for 'Enough!'). The petition attracted 180,000 signatures. The parliamentary vote was 68 votes for and 55 against, with 9 abstentions Catalonia became the second autonomous community in Spain to ban bullfighting after the Canary Islands did so in 1991. The ban came into force on 1 January 2012. Bullfights by matadors were banned in Catalonia at the end 2011 but bull-dodging, in which bulls are . not killed, remains lawful. The last bullfight in Catalonia took place on 25 September 2011 at La Monumental.\nIn October 2016 the Catalonian ban on bullfighting was overturned by the Spanish Constitutional Court. The Court ruled that, though an autonomous region is allowed to regulate bullfighting, an autonomous region is not in a legal position to fully ban such fights.\n\nThe campaign to ban bullfighting in Catalonia was strongly supported by animal rights groups and gained the backing of celebrities including Ricky Gervais and Pamela Anderson. Opponents of the ban suggested that it was not motivated by animal welfare concerns, but by the desire of Catalan nationalists to eradicate from the region something seen as culturally Spanish. It has also been claimed that the Catalan economy will suffer as a result of the ban. The ban did not cover the Catalan tradition of \"correbous\" (roughly meaning bulls running by the streets), including its bou embolat version, in which lit flares are attached to the horns of a bull, cited as an inconsistency by both opponents of the ban and animal rights activists.\n\nThe approval of the PLI repealed the exception to the second paragraph of Article 6 of the Animal Protection Act: \nAnd added to the first paragraph:\n"}

Mountjoy was a lawsuit heard at the Court of Requests in Westminster on 11 May 1612 that involved William Shakespeare in a minor role. \n\nStephen Bellott, a Huguenot, sued his father-in-law Christopher Mountjoy, a tyrer (a manufacturer of ladies' ornamental headpieces and wigs) for the financial settlement that had been promised at the time of his marriage with Mary Mountjoy in 1604, a dowry of £50, which had been promised but never paid, and an additional £200, to be bestowed upon Bellott in Mountjoy's will. \n\nThe records of the case were discovered in 1909 by the Shakespeare scholar Charles William Wallace and published by him in the October 1910 issue of \"Nebraska University Studies\". The importance of this minor case is that Shakespeare was a material witness in it; his signed deposition of evidence was among the papers. Several of the other witnesses referred to Shakespeare’s role in arranging the betrothal and in the negotiations about the dowry. He had been requested to take on the duties by Mountjoy's wife, Marie. The papers supply a roster of persons with whom Shakespeare was personally acquainted: the Mountjoys and their household and neighbours, including George Wilkins, the playwright, novelist and brothel-keeper who may have been Shakespeare's collaborator on \"Pericles, Prince of Tyre\". The papers show that in 1604, Shakespeare was a lodger in the Mountjoys' house, at the corner of Silver and Monkwell Streets in Cripplegate, London. It is the only evidence yet found of a particular London address at which Shakespeare lived.\n\nIn his deposition, Shakespeare admitted that he had played the role as go-between in the courtship of Stephen Bellott and Mary Mountjoy that other witnesses described. However, he said that he could not remember the crucial financial arrangements of the Bellott/Mountjoy marriage settlement. Without that key testimony, the Court of Requests remanded the case to the overseers of the London Huguenot church, which awarded Bellott 20 nobles (or £6 13\"s\". 4\"p\".). A year later, though, Mountjoy still had not paid.\n\n\n"}

Its purpose was to establish a regional standard for the control of the illicit manufacturing and trafficking in firearms: the Inter-American Convention against the Illicit Manufacturing and Trafficking in Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives and Other Related Materiales. CIFTA emphasizes the need for authorizations or licenses of export, imports and transit; the reinforcement of the checkpoints for exports, amongst other things.

{"id": "4181767", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4181767", "title": "Cambridge University primates", "text": "Cambridge University primates\n\nCambridge University primate experiments came to public attention in 2002 after the publication that year of material from a ten-month undercover investigation in 1998 by the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV). The experiments were being conducted on \nmarmosets, and included the removal of parts of their brains intended to simulate the symptoms of stroke or Parkinson's disease. Some of the research was theoretical, aimed at advancing knowledge of the brain, while some of it was applied.\n\nBUAV said the investigation revealed examples of animal abuse indicating that animals were inadequately protected by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. After a review by the government's chief inspector of animals ruled against BUAV's argument that the project licences should not have been granted, BUAV applied to the High Court for a judicial review. The review ruled against BUAV on three of the four grounds, but on the remaining ground it found the Home Office had underestimated the suffering of the marmosets by categorising the experiments as \"moderate,\" rather than \"substantial.\" The Home Office announced a review of its procedures for categorising animal suffering.\n\nAs of October 2002, Cambridge University had three project licences, issued by the Home Office under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, permitting the controlled use of one New World non-human primate species, the common marmoset, \"Callithrix jacchus\". The licence authorised the use of animals bred specifically for research use at breeding establishments in the UK in experiments to study brain function in relation to human disorders. According to the chief inspector of animals, the experimental protocols involved \"the training and testing of animals using a range of behavioural and cognitive tasks; then disrupting normal brain function by chemical or physical lesions; the subsequent administration of experimental treatments intended to minimise the functional defects or repair the damage caused; and further testing to evaluate brain function.\" The animals were killed at the end of the experiments, most of them for tissue analysis.\n\nScientists using marmosets at Cambridge have published their work in peer reviewed journals. This includes discoveries relating to the role of the prefrontal cortex in behaviour, understanding learning and memory, modelling Parkinson's disease, and the role of the amygdala in conditioned reinforcement.\n\nAccording to the British government's inspector of animals and the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection, in some experimental protocols, the monkeys were trained to perform certain behavioural and cognitive tasks, then were made to repeat them after brain damage, to assess how the damage had affected their functioning.\n\nFor example, some of the monkeys suffered from a damaged arm after the experiments. They were then tethered in a way that forced them to use that arm to retrieve food or water. To encourage use of the limb, the monkeys were deprived of food or water for 22 out of every 24 hours for up to two and a half years. The monkeys were usually given an extra feed on Friday afternoons, but some researchers allegedly deprived the monkeys of this too, so that they could keep them hungry for further tests on the Monday.\n\nDuring training for these tasks prior to brain surgery, BUAV claims that researchers were given instructions such as:\n\nOne effect of the brain damage was that the monkeys would engage in stereotypical rotating movements. BUAV reported that one test for Parkinson's disease involved shutting them in a small Perspex box for up to one hour at a time to see how often they would rotate, and injecting them with amphetamine to make them rotate faster. BUAV says the monkeys were often \"clearly distressed and bewildered; they could be seen crying out, twisting frantically, retching or desperately trying to escape.\"\n\nBUAV also says their investigator discovered monkeys who had had the tops of their scalps sawn off to have strokes induced, and who were then left unattended for 15 hours overnight without veterinary attention, because Cambridge staff worked nine to five. Three full-time animal care staff were employed to look after 400 animals, according to a British government review, with the research scientists themselves responsible for the welfare of animals undergoing experimental procedures.\n\nA film produced by BUAV shows a monkey regaining muscle tone during surgery, an indication that the animal was insufficiently anaesthetised. The BUAV report suggested there was a delay of some minutes before more anaesthetic was given.\n\nThe British government's chief inspector of animals conducted a review and published a report in October 2002. It concluded the veterinary input at Cambridge was \"exemplary\"; the facility \"seems adequately staffed\"; and the animals afforded \"appropriate standards of accommodation and care.\" The caging system was \"no longer state of the art\" but complied with Home Office provisions; and the marmoset colony was \"generally healthy.\"The inspector noted four instances of non-compliance with the licence: in two experiments, the surgical procedure was at variance with the project licence; on one occasion, the water restriction schedule was at variance; on one occasion, the licence holder did not inform the department that the severity limit of an experiment had been exceeded; there were minor technical irregularities on reports of how the animals were used.\n\nThe reviewers consulted two experts in veterinary anaesthesia to investigate the consequences of a monkey regaining muscle tone during surgery. They advised that \"unless purposeful or voluntary movements had accompanied the return of muscle tone then ... the anaesthetic agents should have been sufficient to block awareness of pain.\n\nCambridge University welcomed the report as \"confirmation that there was no evidence to support the allegations made by the BUAV.\"\n\nThe BUAV was invited to give evidence to the inquiry, but declined. Nor did it make available the unedited video footage from its film. After publication of the report, the group said it was \"utterly appalled and deeply angered by the Home Office's complete dismissal of overwhelming evidence of animal suffering\" and that \"the government's claim that it was correct to categorise as moderate suffering experiments where monkeys had the top of their skull sawn off and part of their brain sucked out is ludicrous in the extreme.\"\n\nAs a result of the information obtained during their investigation and in light of the subsequent review, BUAV applied to the UK's High Court for permission to seek a judicial review of the legality of the Home Office's interpretation of the Cambridge case, and the wider implementation of vivisection legislation.\n\nMr Justice Burnton rejected four grounds for review directly related to the Cambridge case, but granted permission to seek judicial review on two wider grounds: whether death was an effect to be weighed in cost-benefit analysis and whether guidelines on restricting food and water should be a code of practice under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act. At the Court of Appeal, Lord Justice Keene allowed the review to proceed on two more counts that had originally been refused, on the grounds of public interest. These relate to the question of whether the Home Office underestimated the suffering of the Cambridge marmosets when setting severity limits and whether out-of-hours care and veterinary cover is required by law. \n\nThe 2007 review found in favour of the Home Office on three of the grounds. On the issue of suffering, the court found that the Home Secretary had unlawfully categorised the experiments as \"moderate\", rather than \"substantial\". The Home Office, given leave to appeal the decision, which it did successfully on April 2008 with the Home Office awarded costs.\n\n"}

The meeting also agreed to lift economic sanctions against South Africa in light of moves by the government to end apartheid and grant voting rights to the non-white majority but also agreed to continue its arms embargo until a new non-racial government was elected. The leaders agreed to conditionally accept Cameroon as a member due to improvements in its human rights situation with the proviso that it fully comply with the Harare Declaration on pluralism and human rights by 1995. Commitments were also sought from Sierra Leone's military government for quick elections and a return to democracy. While the country's foreign minister reiterated its intention to hold elections within three years the government did not commit to a date. The summit also agreed that global free trade was desirable and agreed to send a five country delegation to represent the Commonwealth at the current round of talks on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Finally, while the Commonwealth Secretariat had said that a goal of the summit would be the development of a declaration of a 'global humanitarian order', no agreement was reached on specifics of conflict resolution and human rights and a group was appointed instead to study the problem.\n"}

These are judiciary hearings set up by the government to protect the consumer rights. Its main function is to maintain the fair practices by the sellers towards consumers. Consumers can file a case against a seller if they are harassed or exploited by sellers. The court will only give a verdict in favour of the consumers/customers if they have proof of exploitation, i.e., bills or other documents. If a consumer does not have the proper documents required for filing a case then it would be very difficult for the consumer to win or even file a case.\n\n\nThe consumer movement as a social force originated with the necessity of protecting and promoting the interests of consumers against unethical and unfair trade practices. Rampant food shortages, hoarding, black marketing, adulteration of food and edible oil gave birth to the consumer movement in an organized form in the 1960s.\n\nThe movement succeeded in bringing pressure. A major step was taken in 1986 by the Indian government with the enactment of the Consumer Protection Act of 1986 (COPRA).\n\nThe main function of consumer court is to provide some extra privilege to the consumers and to maintain fair practice by the seller or the service provider towards the consumer. Submitting complaint is very simple and a consumer has no need to hire any lawyer. Approaching a consumer court is very simple and extremely cheap as you can represent yourself without having to hire a lawyer and not required to pay any court fee but just a nominal fee.\n\n"}

During this period, a registration must be fully refunded by the domain name registry if cancelled. This was designed to address accidental registrations, but domain tasters use the Add Grace Period for other purposes.\n\nIn April 2006, out of 35 million registrations, about 2 million were permanent or actually purchased. By February 2007, the CEO of Go Daddy reported that of 55.1 million domain names registered, 51.5 million were canceled and refunded just before the 5 day grace period expired and only 3.6 million domain names were actually kept. ICANN's registry report for February 2007 shows that 55,794,877 .com and .net domain names were deleted in that month alone.\n\nDomain tasting is lucrative in a number of ways:\n\nIn January 2008, ICANN proposed several possible solutions, including the elimination of the exemption on transaction costs (US$ 0.20) during the five-day grace period, which would effectively make the practice of domain tasting not viable. The ICANN operating plan and budget for Fiscal Year 2009 included a section intended to deal with the problem of Domain tasting. Now the transaction fee of $0.20 is applied to domains deleted in the Add Grace Period where the number of such domains exceeds 10% of the net new registrations or 50 domains, whichever is greater. The \"net new registrations\" here is defined as the number of new registrations minus the number of domains deleted in the Add Grace Period.\n\nGoogle said in 2008 that their AdSense program would now look for domain names that are repeatedly registered and dropped. These domains will automatically be dropped from the AdSense program.\n\nStarting in April 2009, many top level domains (TLDs) began transitioning from the $0.20 fee for excess domains deleted to implementing a policy resulting in a fee equal to registering the domain.\n\nIn August 2009, ICANN reported that prior to implementing excess domain deletion charges, the peak month for domain tastings was over 15 million domain names. After the $0.20 fee was implemented, tastings dropped to around 2 million domain names per month. As a result of the further increase in charges for excess domain deletions, implemented starting April 2009, the number of domain tastings dropped to below 60 thousand per month. However, these statistics only represent reports from the generic TLDs; ICANN does not set policy for the country code TLDs (ccTLD).\n\nA number of registrars routinely change a domain's name servers to those of their own, or a parking service, when a domain has gone past its expiration or renewal date. Domains continue to resolve for up to 30 days or more after their registration and redemption grace period have expired. The advantage of this \"reverse tasting\" is that the registrars or parking services can determine which domains have traffic before they are deleted, and hence maintain a list of domains that they might re-register (or even transfer) after the deletion date, as part of drop catch services.\n\nDomain tasting should not be confused with domain kiting, which is the process of deleting a domain name during the five-day grace period and immediately re-registering it for another five-day period. This process is repeated any number of times with the end result of having the domain registered without having to pay for it.\n\nIn January 2008, Network Solutions was accused of this practice when the company began reserving all domain names searched on their website for five days, a practice known as domain name front running.\n\nDomain tasting has been used for the purposes of spam. The limited lifetime of the tasted domain allows the spammer to effectively send spam using a disposable domain name.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "329533", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=329533", "title": "Epperson v. Arkansas", "text": "Epperson v. Arkansas\n\nEpperson v. Arkansas, 393 U.S. 97 (1968), was a United States Supreme Court case that invalidated an Arkansas statute that prohibited the teaching of human evolution in the public schools. The Court held that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits a state from requiring, in the words of the majority opinion, \"that teaching and learning must be tailored to the principles or prohibitions of any religious sect or dogma.\" The Supreme Court declared the Arkansas statute unconstitutional because it violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. After this decision, some jurisdictions passed laws that required the teaching of creation science alongside evolution when evolution was taught. These were also ruled unconstitutional by the Court in the 1987 case \"Edwards v. Aguillard\".\nThis case focused on the constitutionality of a 1928 Arkansas statute prohibiting the teaching of human evolutionary theory in its public schools and universities. The statute was enacted during a period of Christian Fundamentalist religious fervor in the 1920s. The Arkansas statute was modeled after Tennessee's 1925 \"Butler Act\", the subject of the well known Scopes Trial in 1925. The Tennessee Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Tennessee law in 1927, allowing the state to continue to prohibit the teaching of evolution.\n\nThe Arkansas law was passed through the initiative process, the first anti-evolution law in the United States passed through general election, and teachers who violated it were made subject to fine and dismissal by the state. The law made it, unlawful for any teacher or other instructor in any university, college, normal, public school or other institution of the state which is supported in whole or in part from public funds derived by state or local taxation to teach the theory or doctrine that mankind ascended or descended from a lower order of animals, and also that it be unlawful for any teacher, textbook commission, or other authority exercising the power to select textbooks for above-mentioned institutions to adopt or use in any such institution a textbook that teaches the doctrine or theory that mankind ascended or descended from a lower order of animal.\n\nThe case in \"Epperson v. Arkansas\" involved the teaching of biology in a Little Rock high school forty years later. Based upon the recommendation of the school biology teachers, the administrators adopted a new textbook for the 1965-1966 school year which contained a chapter discussing Charles Darwin and evolutionary theory, and prescribed the subject be taught to the students.\n\nSusan Epperson was a teacher in the Little Rock school system, employed to teach 10th grade biology at the Little Rock Central High School. The adoption of the new textbook and curriculum standard put her in a legal dilemma because it remained a criminal offense to teach the material in her state, and to do as her school district instructed would also put her at risk of dismissal. Epperson was not opposed to the teaching, and with backing from the Arkansas chapter of the National Education Association and the American Civil Liberties Union, and the unequivocal support of the Little Rock Ministerial Association, filed suit to test the federal constitutionality of the Arkansas state law. She filed in the Chancery Court in Pulaski County seeking nullification of the law and an injunction against her being dismissed for teaching the evolutionary curriculum. She was joined in the suit by H. H. Blanchard, a parent with children in the school.\n\nThe Chancery Court held that the statute violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution which protects citizens from state interference with freedom of speech and thought as contained in the constitution's First Amendment. The lower court decided the law was unconstitutional because it \"tends to hinder the quest for knowledge, restrict the freedom to learn, and restrain the freedom to teach.\"\n\nIn 1967, the Arkansas Supreme Court reversed the lower court ruling. The opinion read:\n\nUpon the principal issue, that of constitutionality, the court holds that Initiated Measure No. 1 of 1928, Ark.Stat.Ann. § 81627 and § 81628 (Repl.1960), is a valid exercise of the state's power to specify the curriculum in its public schools. The court expresses no opinion on the question whether the Act prohibits any explanation of the theory of evolution or merely prohibits teaching that the theory is true, the answer not being necessary to a decision in the case and the issue not having been raised.\n\nThis decision left the ban against teaching evolution in effect.\n\nEpperson appealed the State Supreme Court's reversal to the United States Supreme Court. Eugene R. Warren presented arguments for the appellant, Epperson, and Don Langston, an Assistant Attorney General for Arkansas, argued on behalf of the state of Arkansas. Both Langston and the State Appeal Court focused on the power given to states to set curriculum standards, and did not delve far into the subject of evolutionary theory itself nor to the boundaries between church and state.\n\nThe Court found that not only was the state prohibited from advancing or protecting a particular religious view, but that, [T]he state has no legitimate interest in protecting any or all religions from views distasteful to them.\n\nJustice Hugo Black issued a separate opinion to overturn the Arkansas law, finding the law unconstitutionally \"vague\" rather than an unconstitutional religious infringement. While agreeing with the majority to reverse the State Appeal Court decision, his opinion details his dissent from the majority over the First Amendment issue.\n\nOutside of its impact on separation of church and state issues, Epperson v. Arkansas is the origin of the \"directly and sharply\" test for when Courts may intervene in the daily operations of school systems.\n\nCourts do not and cannot intervene in the resolution of conflicts which arise in the daily operation of school systems and which do not directly and sharply implicate basic constitutional values. On the other hand, the vigilant protection of constitutional freedoms is nowhere more vital than in the community of American schools.\n\nThe \"directly and sharply\" test is often used to dismiss USC 1983 cases brought by parents claiming civil rights violations by school districts.\n\nThough William Jennings Bryan famously testified to some questions about Biblical creation in the 1925 \"Scopes v. State\" trial, that Court, like this one, was asked only to judge whether or not teachings about human evolution could be prohibited in the public schools. Even in that case Bryan, who opposed the evolution instruction, never argued that the teaching of Biblical creation belonged in the school. \n\nThe precedent set in \"Epperson\", in which the Court concluded the sole motive behind the ban against evolution teaching in Arkansas was to protect a particular religious view, effectively nullified all other related evolution education prohibitions throughout the United States. Within a short time of the \"Epperson\" decision, religious opponents of the teaching attempted through other means to lessen its influence in the curriculum, including requiring schools to teach biblical creation alongside evolution or forcing schools to provide disclaimers that evolution was \"only a theory\". These attempts eventually resulted in precedent-setting court decisions, and ultimately \"Edwards v. Aguillard\", which struck down a Louisiana statute as unconstitutional.\n\n\n\n"}

Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978), is a landmark United States Supreme Court decision that defined the power of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) over indecent material as applied to broadcasting.\n\nIn 1973, a father complained to the FCC that his son had heard the George Carlin routine \"Filthy Words\" broadcast one afternoon over WBAI, a Pacifica Foundation FM radio station in New York City. Pacifica received censure from the FCC, in the form of a letter of reprimand, for allegedly violating FCC regulations which prohibited broadcasting indecent material.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court upheld the FCC's actions in 1978, by a vote of 5 to 4, ruling that the routine was \"indecent but not obscene\". The Court recognized the government had strong interests in:\n\nThe \"Pacifica\" Court upheld the FCC’s power to regulate broadcast media, citing two pervading governmental interests. First, the “uniquely pervasive” nature of these broadcasts allows them to seep into “the privacy of the home” without the consent of the viewer. Second, broadcasts are “uniquely accessible to children” whose “vocabulary [could be enlarged] in an instant” by hearing indecent or profane language. The Court held that these two concerns were sufficient to “justify special treatment of indecent broadcasting,” thereby allowing the FCC to fine broadcasters for airing inappropriate content.\n\nThe Court stated that the FCC had the authority to prohibit such broadcasts during hours when children were likely to be among the audience, and gave the FCC broad leeway to determine what constituted indecency in different contexts.\n\nAt first, despite the resounding win in \"Pacifica\", the FCC used its new regulatory powers sparingly. In the 1980s, however, the FCC ramped up sanctions for indecent broadcasts as conservative groups and the Reagan Administration expressed concern over the rise of “shock jock” radio personalities. And by the early 2000s, the FCC began to levy more sanctions with higher dollar amounts—with fines of up to $500,000 for some offenses.\n\nIn 1997, Pacifica Radio \"Living Room\" host Larry Bensky prefaced an interview with Carlin by saying: \"George Carlin, you're a very unusual guest for Pacifica Radio. You're probably the only person in the United States that we don't have to give The Carlin Warning to about which words you can't say on this program, because it's named after you.\"\n\nIn 1996, Congress passed the Communications Decency Act, which criminalized the knowing transmission of \"obscene or indecent\" messages to underage people. In \"Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union\" (1997), the American Civil Liberties Union claimed that the act violated First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech. To attain standing, the ACLU published the Supreme Court's opinion on \"F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation\" on its website, which included a transcript of Carlin's monologue.\n\nAt least one scholar has argued that modern self-censoring technology—\"e.g.\", the V-chip—has significantly undermined the Supreme Court's rationale in \"Pacifica\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2021636", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2021636", "title": "Federal Arbitration Act", "text": "Federal Arbitration Act\n\nThe United States Arbitration Act (, codified at ), more commonly referred to as the Federal Arbitration Act or FAA, is an act of Congress that provides for judicial facilitation of private dispute resolution through arbitration. It applies in both state courts and federal courts, as was held constitutional in \"Southland Corp. v. Keating\". It applies where the transaction contemplated by the parties \"involves\" interstate commerce and is predicated on an exercise of the Commerce Clause powers granted to Congress in the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe FAA provides for contractually based compulsory and binding arbitration, resulting in an \"arbitration award\" entered by an arbitrator or arbitration panel as opposed to a \"judgment\" entered by a court of law. In an arbitration, the parties give up the right to an appeal on substantive grounds to a court.\n\nOnce an award is entered by an arbitrator or arbitration panel, it must be \"confirmed\" in a court of law; and once confirmed, the award is reduced to an enforceable judgment, which may be enforced by the winning party in court, like any other judgment. Under the FAA, an award must be confirmed within one year, and any objection to an award must be challenged by the losing party within three months. An arbitration agreement may be entered \"prospectively\" (ie., in advance of any actual dispute), or may be entered into by the disputing parties once a dispute has arisen.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in \"Hall Street Associates, L.L.C. v. Mattel, Inc.\" that the grounds for judicial review specified in the FAA may not be expanded, even if the parties to the arbitration agreement agree to allow expanded review of the decision.\n\nOn June 20, 2013, the Court ruled in \"American Express Co. v. Italian Colors Restaurant\" that class action waivers contained in mandatory arbitration clauses were valid even if plaintiffs prove that it would not be economically practicable to maintain these actions individually.\n\nIn its decision on \"Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis\" on May 21, 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that the FAA is not overridden by the protection of concerned activity established by the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, effectively making individual arbitration agreements in contracts wholly enforceable.\n\nSection 2 of the FAA declares that arbitration provisions will be subject to invalidation only for the same grounds applicable to contractual provisions generally, such as unconscionability or duress. Consequently, most state law that disfavors the enforcement of arbitration agreements will be preempted by the FAA. State laws that govern the procedures of arbitration, but do not affect its enforcement, are outside the Act's preemptive scope.\n\nNot all state laws regarding arbitration are preempted, for example:\n\nHowever, a recent Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) Office of Hearing Officers (OHO) decision in a disciplinary action against Charles Schwab & Co. questions the ability of a regulator to enforce arbitration agreement restrictions such as NASD Rule 12204 (FINRA Rule 2268). The dispute arose when Charles Schwab & Co. revised its pre-dispute arbitration agreement to preclude a customer from participating in a class action against the firm, effectively removing the ability for a customer to have a claim heard in court. FINRA rules require arbitration through a FINRA arbitration panel, except in the case of class actions, which are reserved for the court system.\n\nSpecifically, the OHO Panel cited the Supreme Court decision in \"Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon\" that securities law claims are no exception to the FAA's mandate that parties to an otherwise valid arbitration agreement submit the claim to arbitration. The OHO Panel also applied the Supreme Court decision in \"AT&T Mobility v. Concepcion\" where the Court established that class actions also are not an exception to the FAA, stating that a party to an arbitration agreement has no right to participate in a class action instead of an arbitration on an individual basis and that an exception to the FAA's mandate requires clear expression of Congressional intent. FINRA has appealed the OHO decision to the National Adjudicatory Council.\n\nA case-by-case analysis is required to determine whether a specific California law is preempted. In general where the FAA has no procedural provisions applicable in state court, there is no preemption.\n\nA number of Supreme Court cases have dealt with the preemption of state laws by the Federal Arbitration Act:\n\n"}

Garnishment allows the plaintiff (the \"garnishor\") to take the money or property of the debtor from the person or institution that holds that property (the \"garnishee\"). A similar legal mechanism called execution allows the seizure of money or property held directly by the debtor.\n\nSome jurisdictions may allow for garnishment by a tax agency without the need to first obtain a judgment or other court order.\n\nWage garnishment, the most common type of garnishment, is the process of deducting money from an employee's monetary compensation (including salary), usually as a result of a court order. Wage garnishments may continue until the entire debt is paid or arrangements are made to pay off the debt. Garnishments can be taken for any type of debt but common examples of debt that result in garnishments include:\n\nWhen served on an employer, garnishments are taken as part of the payroll process. When processing payroll, sometimes there is not enough money in the employee's net pay to satisfy all of the garnishments. For example, in a case with federal tax, local tax, and credit card garnishments, the first garnishment taken would be the federal tax garnishments, then local tax garnishments, and, finally, garnishments for the credit card. Employers receive a notice telling them to withhold a certain amount of their employee's wages for payment and cannot refuse to garnish wages. Employers must correctly calculate the amount to withhold, and must make the deductions until the garnishment expires. \n\nWage garnishment can negatively affect credit, reputation, and the ability to receive a loan or open a bank account.\n\nAt present four U.S. states—Pennsylvania, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas—do not allow wage garnishment at all except for tax-related debt, child support, federally guaranteed student loans, and court-ordered fines or restitution. The federal garnishment limit (with some exceptions like child support and student loans) on a weekly basis is the lower of (A) 25% of one's disposable earnings (what's left after mandatory tax deductions), or (B) the total amount by which one's weekly wage exceeds thirty times the federal hourly minimum wage. Several other states observe maximum thresholds that are lower than the maxima provided by federal law. States may also prohibit garnishment altogether in certain circumstances. For example, in Florida the wages of a person who provides more than half the support for a child or other dependent are exempt from garnishment altogether (though this is subject to waiver). Loans and negotiations with creditors can also help debtors to avoid wage garnishment.\n\nIn Minnesota, there are five limits on wage garnishment: Creditors cannot garnish wages for social security benefits, retirement benefits, welfare payments, workers' compensation benefits, or income associated with disability or unemployment insurance.\n\nIn many states when the person is an employee or appointee of a governmental unit the writ is called a Writ of Sequestration. These are processed by the courts in the same manner as garnishments and are subject to the same wage exemptions.\n\nIn the United States, firing an employee to avoid handling a levy may be a criminal offense. Federal law provides for a fine of up to $1,000 and imprisonment for up to one year on an employer who willfully fires an employee in connection with a garnishment of the employee's earnings.\n\nThe other type of garnishment, also known as \"attachment\" (or attachment of earnings), requires the garnishee to deliver all the defendant's money and/or property in the hands of the garnishee at the time of service of process to the court, to be paid over to the plaintiff. Since this type of garnishment is not continuing in nature, but is not subject to the type of restrictions that apply to wage garnishment, it is most often used against banks, or other persons or companies that incur liquidated obligations in the regular course of business. The garnishment should not begin during the pay period but instead on the following pay period\n\nUnder U.S. federal tax law, a garnishment by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is a form of administrative levy. In the case of an IRS levy, no court order is required.\n\nOnly a few requirements must be met before the IRS starts a wage garnishment:\n\nThe IRS may serve the Final Notice in person, may leave the notice at the taxpayer’s home or usual place of business, or may send it to the last known address by certified or registered mail. The IRS is required to send the Final Notice to the last address known to the agency. The taxpayer does not need to actually receive the notice for the notice to be effective. Many taxpayers never actually receive the final notice. Those taxpayers may not realize they are in danger of receiving a levy until their wages are actually garnished.\n\n"}
{"id": "6914312", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6914312", "title": "Infectious invalidity", "text": "Infectious invalidity\n\nInfectious invalidity is a doctrine of property law that provides that under certain defined circumstances because one action is improper another action is invalid. If applicable, the failure of certain transfers may cause interests that are otherwise valid to fail also. This approach was taken in the Massachusetts case of \"New England Trust Co. v. Sanger\", 337 Mass. 342, 149 N.E.2d 598 (1958).\n\nThe Restatement (2d) of Property, which is a treatise describing general legal principles applied by the courts in the United States states that \nInfectious invalidity means that the failure of certain transfers may cause interests that are otherwise valid to fail also. This approach was taken in New England Trust Co. v. Sanger, 337 Mass. 342, 149 N.E.2d 598 (1958). A trust provided for income to be paid to the surviving children of the settlor's brother for life, and on the death of the last surviving child of the settlor's brother, an equal division of the trust principle was to be made among the issue of the children of the settlor's brother. The gift to the issue of the brother's children failed, because the ascertainment of issue could not be made until the brother's children died, and the brother might have children born after the creation of the trust who might not die within the permissible period. However, a later trust had been established by the settlor, which stated that if any provision in the first trust indenture should be declared invalid, any income or principal which reverted to his estate should be deemed held in trust by the settlor for the benefit of his brother's children and their issue. Applying the doctrine of infectious invalidity to avoid a distortion of the settlor's \"clear desire,\" the court held that the second trust should govern the trust distribution. It stated that by striking down all the gifts, valid and invalid, made in the first trust, and by giving effect to the second trust, the settlor's plan for the income gifts was substantially carried out. [§ 1.5 comment 7] \n\nIn zoning law, infectious invalidity is a principle where a parcel of land that itself complies with zoning requirements is considered to be in violation of zoning laws because of the circumstances of its creation. The situation arises when a parcel of land is improperly divided into two lots, resulting in one of the new lot conforming to the applicable zoning standards and one lot not conforming. The legal principle is applied resulting in the conforming lot being deemed to be infected because of the illegal condition created on the other lot and the creation of the two lots is deemed invalid. Infectious invalidity affects both zoning and property ownership rights.\n"}
{"id": "1288807", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1288807", "title": "Inspector", "text": "Inspector\n\nInspector is both a police rank and an administrative position, both used in a number of contexts. However, it is not an equivalent rank in each police force.\n\nIn Australian police forces, the rank of Inspector is generally the next senior rank from Senior Sergeant and is less senior than a superintendent (in the cases of the Queensland Police and Western Australia Police) in the other Australian police forces. Members holding the rank usually wear an epaulette featuring three silver pips, the same rank badge as a Captain in the army.\nIn addition to the general rank of Inspector, some police forces use other ranks such as Detective Inspector and District Inspector.\n\nIn Austria a similar scheme was used as in Germany. At some point the police inspector was completely removed from the list of service ranks. The current police service has an inspectors service track with \"Inspektor\" being the entry level – it is followed by \"Revierinspektor\" (precinct inspector), \"Gruppeninspektor\" (group inspector), \"Bezirksinspektor\" (district inspector), \"Abteilungsinspektor\" (section inspector), \"Kontrollinspektor\" (control inspector) and \"Chefinspektor\" (chief inspector).\n\nIn most Canadian police services the rank of inspector is the first above the staff sergeant rank. It is usually immediately below the rank of superintendent. Senior inspectors are a high administrative rank in Canada's police forces and are considered to be the first level of senior management.\n\nProvincial Police Services and the majority of Municipal Police Services, such as the Toronto Police Service have a staff inspector rank, which ranks above inspector and below superintendent. Other commonwealth police agencies and some American police departments, such as the Philadelphia Police Department also have staff inspectors.\n\nIn the French National Police, inspecteur is a former rank of members of the Command and Management Corps. There were several grades of \"Inspecteur\", with senior detectives holding the various grades of commissaire. See French National Police for current ranks. In the French customs, inspecteur is the first rank of members of the Command and Management Corps.\n\nIn contemporary Germany, \"Inspektor\" is a civil service rank. It is the lowest and therefore the entry rank of the \"gehobener Dienst\" (upper service) requiring a degree from a three-year administrative college. The rank is not used in the German police services; there the equivalent of Inspektor is Kommissar. In earlier times the upper service track was called \"Inspektorenlaufbahn\" (inspectors service track) ranging from \"Inspektor\", \"Oberinspektor\" (senior inspector), \"Amtmann\", \"Amtsrat\" to \"Oberamtsrat\" (senior supervisor).\n\nThe title is used on many professional areas that require an inspection service, like \"Brandinspektor\" (fire inspector in the fire department), \"Steuerinspektor\" (tax inspector in the financial department) or \"Bauinspektor\" (building inspector in building control) that are in a supervision position of their department. In many administration parts a corresponding position exists like the \"Regierungsinspektor\" (government inspector on the federal level), \"Stadtinspektor\"/\"Stadtverwaltungsinspektor\" (city administration inspector), \"Kreisinspektor\"/\"Kreisverwaltungsinspektor\" (county administration inspector) that serve in supervision of the department.\n\nIn some regions the \"Inspektor\" is a colloquial name for any police officer just like in Austria.\n\nIn the Hong Kong Police Force, inspector (including probationary inspector and senior inspector) is the rank senior to station sergeant but junior to chief inspector, leading a sub-unit in day-to-day policing. Rank badge of probationary inspector is one silver pip on his/her epaulette; 2 silver pips for inspector of police; and 2 silver pips and one bar on for senior inspector of police. The epaulettes rank badge of chief inspector is 3 silver pips. The epaulettes of all inspectors do not show their personal identification number. Plain-clothes detective inspectors have the prefix \"detective\" identifying them as having been trained in criminal investigation and being part of Criminal Investigation Department (CID) or Organised Crime Triad Bureau (OCTB).\n\nSeveral of the HKP's past and current Commissioner of Chiefs joined the force as Probationary Inspector ranks as opposed to the junior ranks.\n\nCustoms and Excise Department also have inspector ranking but with bronze stars and bars rank badge instead.\n\nIn addition, there are Health Inspectors from the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department who carry out investigation and prosecution on sanitary nuisance and irregularities of food business under related ordinances. They are characterised by golden stars and yellow rank badge.\n\nIn the Indonesian National Police, there are four levels of inspector, which are First Police Inspector (\"Inspektur Polisi Satu\"), Senior Police Inspector (\"Inspektur Polisi Dua\"), First Police Inspector Adjutant (\"Ajun Inspektur Polisi Satu\"), and Second Police Inspector Adjutant (\"Ajun Inspektur Polisi Dua\"). Those ranks are below the rank of Police Commissioner Adjutant (\"Ajun Komisaris Polisi\") and above the rank of Chief Police Brigadier (\"Brigadir Polisi Kepala\").\n\nInspectors of Police in India are typically the officer in charge at a police station. In a police station in India, there are Constables, the Head Constables, Sub Inspector and The Inspector. They have the three-star insignia to indicate their position and they are high command officers.\nInspector's post is higher than sub inspector's post whose post is higher than assistant sub inspector's post.\n\nIn the \"Garda Síochána\", inspectors are senior to sergeants and junior to superintendents. Inspectors may be either detectives or in uniform.\n\nIn the \"Polizia di Stato\", the position of \"Ispettore\" (Inspector) replaced the rank of \"Maresciallo\" after the 1981 reorganization and demilitarization of the corps; an \"Ispettore\" is thus a Sergeant of several sorts, above the rank of \"Sovrintendente\" (Superintendent, which is somewhat equal to a Senior Corporal) and under the rank of \"Commissario\". There are three four different Inspector ranks in the Polizia di Stato: \"Vice Ispettore\" (\"Assistant Inspector\"), \"Ispettore\" (\"Inspector\"), \"Ispettore Capo\" (\"Chief Inspector\") and \"Ispettore Superiore\" (\"Special Inspector\", or \"Superior Inspector\"), roughly equivalent to the ranks ranging from Junior Sergeant to Second Lieutenant. A fifth position, called \"Ispettore Superiore S.U.P.S.\", where the achronym stands for \"Sostituto Ufficiale di Pubblica Sicurezza\" (\"Special Inspector – Substitute Public Safety Commissioned Officer\"), is used to designate those Inspectors which can act as substitutes to Commissioners in the chain of command under certain situations, or in Police detachments that are too small to require the presence of a Commissioner; when this happens, the officer is named \"Ispettore Superiore – Sostituto Commissario\" (\"Special Inspector – Substitute Commissioner\"). Inspectors can serve either in uniformed patrol duties, plain-clothed patrol duties, or as detectives. The Inspector ranks are the highest that an Italian Police officer can reach without having a University degree.\n\nIn the Royal Malaysia Police, the rank of Inspector is one level above Sub-Inspector and one level below Assistant Superintendent. There are two stages: probation inspector (probation lasts within three years) and inspector. Inspectors are recruited differently from normal police constables, requiring at least a degree, and their training is longer.\n\nIn Nepal Police, the rank of Inspector is generally the next senior rank from Sub Inspector (SI) and is less senior than a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP). Members holding the rank usually wear an epaulette featuring one pair of crossed kukri, the same rank badge as a Inspector in Armed Police Force (Nepal).\n\nIn the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary, the rank of Inspector is one level above Chief Sergeant and below Senior Inspector. Officer Cadets normally graduate and automatically become an Inspector.\n\nIn the Philippines, inspector is a rank in the Philippine National Police, the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology, and the Bureau of Fire Protection. It is above the senior officer 4 (sergeant) and below the senior inspector (captain). It is regarded as an equivalent of a lieutenant in the Army.\n\nIn Poland, inspector (\"inspektor\") is a high rank (above \"podinspektor\" and \"młodszy inspektor\", but below \"nadinspektor\"), comparable to colonel of the armed forces.\n\nIn the Romanian Police, inspector is a rank senior to \"Subinspector\" and junior to \"Inspector principal\" and corresponds to the former rank of Police Lieutenant (\"see Romanian Police Ranks\").\n\nIn the Singapore Police Force, there are several ranks that have the title of Inspector in it.\n\nIn the junior police officer category, there is the rank of 'Station Inspector', 'Senior Station Inspector' and 'Senior Station Inspector (2)'. The title of 'Inspector' is in the senior police officer category. For National Servicemen, outstanding policemen may be appointed as a 'National Service Probationary Inspector'.\n\nIn the National Police Cadet Corps, the rank of Probationary Inspector is given to officer cadet trainees who have successfully completed their Officers' Basic Training Course or Honorary Officers' Basic Training Course. Probationary Inspectors who pass their probationary period will then attain the rank of Inspector. The rank insignia of Probationary Inspector and Inspector is two pips, with the letters 'NPCC' below it, so as to differentiate NPCC Inspectors from Singapore Police Force personnel. \n\nIn Spain, the rank of Inspector exists in the National Police Force of Spain (), the Catalan Police Force, and several municipal police forces.\n\nIn the Sri Lanka Police Service, Inspector of Police (IP) is senior to \"Sub-Inspector\" and junior to \"Chief Inspector\". In many towns, Inspectors would be the Officer in Charge (OIC) at most police stations. The rank insignia for a Police Inspector is two stars.\n\nIn addition to the Police, the term Inspector is used in other government departments for posts such as \"Chief Inspector of Excise\", \"Inspector of Excise\", \"Chief Inspector of Customs\", \"Inspector of Customs\", \"Co-operative Inspector\", \"Fisheries Inspector\", Public Health Inspector.\n\nWithin the British police, inspector is the second supervisory rank. It is senior to that of sergeant, but junior to that of chief inspector. The rank is mostly operational, meaning that inspectors are directly concerned with day-to-day policing. Uniformed inspectors are often responsible for supervising a duty shift made up of constables and sergeants, or act in specialist roles such as supervising road traffic policing.\n\nThe rank of inspector has existed since the foundation of the Metropolitan Police, formed in 1829, when it was used to designate the rank immediately below that of superintendent, and many Commonwealth police forces also use the term.\n\nPlain-clothes detective inspectors are equal in rank to their uniformed counterparts, the prefix \"detective\" identifying them as having been trained in criminal investigation and being part of or attached to their force's Criminal Investigation Department (CID).\n\nThe epaulettes of uniformed inspectors, unlike those of constables and sergeants, do not show a divisional or personal identification number. Instead they feature Order of the Bath stars, informally known as \"pips\", being the same insignia as those of a lieutenant in the British Army.\n\nNewly promoted inspectors currently receive a salary of £48,690 (£50,823 London) (2016 payscale) rising to £50,061 (£52,200 London).\n\nIn the Metropolitan Police, the rank was formerly officially known as Station Inspector to distinguish it from the more senior rank of Sub-Divisional Inspector (abolished in 1949). A Station Inspector wore a single star on his epaulettes until 1936, when this changed to a star over two bars to accommodate the new rank of Junior Station Inspector (wearing a star over one bar).\n\nIn the United States, the term inspector can have very different meanings depending on the law enforcement agency.\n\nAn inspector in a US municipal police department is more likely to be a senior executive officer, analogous to a Commonwealth police superintendent or chief superintendent. It may also be a title held by a supervisor of detectives.\n\nIn the New York City Police Department, a deputy inspector is one grade above captain and an inspector is another grade higher, wearing the insignia of a military colonel. in the Philadelphia Police Department, a staff inspector is a grade above captain and an inspector is another grade higher, with the insignia of a lieutenant colonel. An inspector is also two grades above a captain in the Baltimore Police Department, Nassau County Police Department and Suffolk County Police Department.\n\nInspector is more rarely used as a rank that is one grade above captain, such as in the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia. This is equivalent to a major or commander in other departments. The Los Angeles Police Department formerly had a rank of inspector for this purpose. It was changed to commander in 1974, because LAPD senior officers preferred the more military-sounding title.\n\nIn the police departments of Hayward, California, Oklahoma City and formerly in Berkeley, California, inspector is the rank held by a senior detective.\n\nIn the San Francisco Police Department, inspector was the normal title for a detective. Unlike detectives in most other departments, inspectors in San Francisco always had supervisory duties. The investigative branch of the SFPD was called the Bureau of Inspectors, since renamed the Investigations Bureau.\n\nIn the Wisconsin State Patrol, and others, inspectors are state troopers assigned to the motor carrier safety inspection unit where they enforce trucking laws and regulations.\n\nThe North Carolina Department of Transportation's Division of Motor Vehicles License and Theft Bureau uses the title of inspector for its sworn state law enforcement agents/investigators. The inspectors of this agency investigate motor vehicle theft, title and odometer frauds, state issued identification and driver's license frauds, as well as regulate and inspect motor vehicle dealerships, repair shops, tow and storage facilities, and emissions and safety inspection centers. The NC DMV License and Theft Bureau is the state's oldest law enforcement agency and was formed in 1921 to combat vehicle theft with the rising sales of Ford's Model T. The agency has kept the title designation of inspector for traditional purposes.\n\nThe Oregon Liquor Control Commission uses the title of inspector for sworn law enforcement agents who investigate violations of the Liquor Control Act and other related crimes.\n\nIn the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), an inspector is a special agent whose main duty is inspecting local field offices and resident agencies to make sure they are operating efficiently. Since FBI inspectors are not tied to any particular field office, they have, in the past, also been used as trouble-shooting investigators on major cases. Joseph Sullivan was perhaps the best-known of the Bureau's Major Case Inspectors and served as the model for Inspector Lew Erskine, the fictional character played by Efrem Zimbalist Jr. in the 1965–1974 ABC TV series \"The FBI\". Samuel P. Cowley was an FBI inspector in the late 1920s and 1930s who assisted in bringing down notorious gangsters such as John Dillinger in the early 1930s, before his death in November 1934 in a gun battle with Baby Face Nelson.\n\nThe United States Marshals Service and the Drug Enforcement Administration employ similar positions, but they primarily serve as internal affairs investigators.\nThe United States Park Police changed the rank of Inspector to the rank of Major, which is between captain and deputy chief.\nIn the Postal Inspection Service, inspector is the name given to 1811 job series criminal investigators, better known as special agents in most other federal law enforcement agencies.\n\nPrior to 2003, the US Customs Service (USCS) and the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) had uniformed, law enforcement employees called Customs Inspectors and Immigration Inspectors. These employees inspected and processed people and merchandise entering the United States from foreign countries, at a land border, seaport or airport. They wore different types of uniforms and had different duties, but were paid essentially the same. After US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) was established with the merging of the above two agencies, the inspectors were retitled Customs and Border Protection Officers and merged their responsibilities.\n\nIn American administrative law, an inspector is an official charged with the duty to issue permits, such as a building inspector or sanitation inspector, and to enforce the relevant regulations and laws. These positions are commonly known as the Fire Inspector or Building Inspector. The duty it act is based on the adopted building or fire code in the municipality. A government agency may also have an Inspector General responsible for preventing internal fraud, waste, abuse and other agency deficiencies.\n\nIn fiction, \"Inspector\" is often used as a term and title for a detective, even if their duties and role does not match that of an inspector in a Commonwealth police force. Examples of fictional inspectors include the characters of Inspector Clouseau, Inspector Gadget, Inspector Javert, Inspector Morse and the title character of \"An Inspector Calls\".\n\n"}

North American domestic racing, such as NASCAR and IndyCar are outside the FIA's jurisdiction and hence not governed by the ISC. Motorcycle sport is also exempt since the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM) is responsible for this sport, not the FIA.\n\nThe ISC consists of 17 chapters and several appendices. It contains definitions, general principles, and regulations, as well as rules for race organizers, contenders, racers, and official referees. As the sport of motor racing is very hierarchic, the ISC also determines the rules of national racing federations.\n\nThe ISC consists of 17 chapters. In the first chapter it is determined that the FIA is the sole international sporting authority entitled to make and enforce regulations regarding automobile competitions. It is further determined that the ISC is a regulation to encourage and facilitate international motor sport. Each national autosport club or federation affiliated with the FIA is allowed to draw up their own rules. The ISC will not be enforced, as long competition is safe and fair.\n\nWith regard to records the ISC differentiates between international records and local records. Local records established on a permanent or temporary track fall within the scope of the national federation of that country. Appendix D applies to international records.\n\nThis chapter features articles about what kind of vehicles exist and what kind of motor sport competitions exist.\n\nAn event held on a closed circuit between two or more vehicles, running at the same time on the same course, in which speed or the distance covered in a given time is the determining factor.\n\nAn acceleration contest between two vehicles racing from a standing start over a straight, precisely measured course in which the first vehicle to cross the finish line (without penalty) achieves the better performance\n\nAn event in which each vehicle takes the start individually to cover the same course ending with a finish line situated at a higher altitude than the start line. The time \ntaken to cover the distance between the start and finish lines is the determining factor for establishing the classifications.\n\nRoad event with an imposed average speed, which is run entirely or partly on roads open to normal traffic. A rally consists either of a single itinerary which must be followed by all cars, or of several itineraries converging on a same rallying-point fixed beforehand and followed or not by a common itinerary.\n\nThe length of each selective section must be no more than 500 km and the total length of the event must be at least 800 km.\n\nThe total course must be at least 10,000 km and the distance of the legs is free. The total duration may not exceed 31 days, including scrutineering and prologue. Only cars in Groups T (T1, T2, T3, T4) may be admitted.\n\nThe ISC further regulates what kind of officials exist, penalties when a breach of rules appears and how to protest and appeal.\n\nAppendix D of the ISC further regulates attempts at land speed records. In accordance to the appendix, world records can only be set in four categories:\n\nEach category could be further subdivided in groups according to engine type.\nThe appendix also features different types of records e.a. acceleration records, distance records (flying start) or distance records (standing start).\n\nAppendix J was introduced by the FIA in 1954, initially for Touring Cars and GT Cars. It regulates what kind of cars race in what classes and what the specifications are. Currently Appendix J features three categories and fifteen groups:\n\nFor each group specific rules are further defined in the regulations. Group D, which features Formula 1 and Formula 3, has specific regulations (technical and sporting) for each class.\n\n"}

Therefore, a Jordanian man who holds Jordanian citizenship can automatically confer citizenship to his children and foreign wives. Under the current law, descendants of Jordanian emigrants can only receive citizenship from their father as women cannot pass on citizenship to their children or foreign spouses. Since 2010, there has been an increasing public demand for giving the opportunity for Jordanian women to transmit their Jordanian nationality to their children and also to their husbands.\n\nIn recent years, Jordan, the only Arab country with a significant population of assimilated Palestinian refugees that provides citizenship, has been found to be unexpectedly stripping Jordanian citizenship from citizens of Palestinian origin, leading to growing concerns and amplifying the national debate over the Palestinian presence in Jordan and the Palestinian right of return in relation to the preservation of Palestinian territories from Israeli forces.\n\nCitizens of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan by law have the legal right to:\n\n\nIn a state of necessity, all Jordanian citizens are required, when prescribed by the law of the Jordanian government, to bear arms on behalf of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, to perform noncombatant service in the Jordanian Armed Forces, and to perform work of national importance under civilian direction.\n\nUnder the supervision of an official authority, a person convicted by a court of law may be required to do any work or to render any service provided that the person is not hired to or placed at the disposal of any persons, companies, societies or public bodies.\n\nThe code covering the Jordanian nationality was issued on 1 January 1954 as the Jordanian Nationality Law of 1954 and was last amended in 1987.\n\nAccording to the Jordanian government, there have been no restrictions on multiple citizenship in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan since its 1954 law on Jordanian nationality. Thus, foreigners who acquire Jordanian citizenship and Jordanian citizens who voluntarily acquire another citizenship keep their previous citizenship (subject to the laws of the other country).\n\nA child is Jordanian at birth if:\n\nAs per law No. 6 of 1954 on Nationality (last amended 1987).\n\nArticle 4: \nAny Arab who has resided continuously in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan for not less than 15 years may acquire Jordanian nationality, by decision of the Council of Ministers taken on a proposal by the Minister of Internal Affairs, if he renounces his nationality of origin and the law of his country permits him to do so, provided that:\n\n(1)He is of good conduct and has never been convicted of an offence involving his honour or morals;\n\n(2)He has lawful means of livelihood;\n\n(3)He is of sound mind and does not suffer from any impairment that would make him a burden on society;\n\n(4)He takes an oath of allegiance and loyalty to his Majesty before a justice of the peace.\n\nArticle 12:\nAny person other than a Jordanian who is not incapable by law may apply to the Council of Ministers for grant of a certificate of Jordanian naturalization if:\n\n(1)He has been regularly resident in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan for a period of four years preceding the date of his application;\n\n(2)He intends to reside in the Hashemite Kingdom of the Jordan.\n\nBirth in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan does not in itself confer Jordanian citizenship. Therefore, Jus soli does not apply.\n\nA Jordanian may neither lose Jordanian citizenship nor acquire the nationality of another nation without the consent of the Board of Ministers, unless that other nation is an Arab state.\n\nJordanian law permits voluntary renunciation of Jordanian citizenship, with the permission of the Board of Ministers. Someone wishing to renounce their citizenship must contact the a Jordanian consular or diplomatic officer or a Jordanian embassy within a foreign nation and pay the required fee and further be approved by the Ministry of the Interior.\n\nA child whose Jordanian citizenship depends on paternal links loses citizenship when those are cut.\n\nA Jordanian child adopted by foreign parents is considered to have lost Jordanian citizenship.\n\nWhere a former Jordanian citizen lost citizenship due to adoption by foreign parents and that adoption is later annulled, the Jordanian citizenship is considered to never have been lost.\n\nEven though Jordanian nationality law permits multiple citizenship, a Jordanian national who also holds another country's citizenship may be required to renounce the foreign citizenship, under the foreign country's nationality law. A dual Jordanian-Japanese national must, for instance, make a declaration of choice, to the Japanese Ministry of Justice, before turning 22, as to whether he or she wants to keep the Jordanian or Japanese citizenship.\n\nA person who commits misconduct that undermines the security of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan may be stripped and his family of their citizenships\n\nA person who joins the Armed Forces of another state will lose their Jordanian citizenship.\n\nSince 2010, there has been an increasing public demand for giving the opportunity for Jordanian women to transmit their Jordanian nationality to their children and also to their husbands. In recent years, growing domestic pressures and foreign concerns have demanded the Jordanian government to grant civil rights to the children of Jordanian women married to foreigners, including the right to receive treatment in hospitals affiliated with the Ministry of Health, the right to obtain residency permits and the right to education in public schools and universities. This is in addition to their right to work, obtain driver’s licenses and perhaps grant them ordinary passports (without a national number) to facilitate their travel outside the country.\n\nOn 7 September 2014, amidst growing public outcry and pressures from foreign leaders such as the United States Secretary of State John Kerry, Jordanian Prime Minister Abdullah Ensour announced the government's approval to grant children of Jordanian women married to foreigners certain privileges and facilities to ease their lives within Jordan.\n\nThe regulations were issued on 4 January 2015 and, near the end of the month, the Civil Status and Passports Department (CSPD) had received 9,741 applications to issue special identification cards for children of Jordanian women married to foreigners. Marwan Qteishat, director of the CSPD, told The Jordan Times near the end of January 2015 that they had issued 965 identification cards and processed 2,148 applications.\n\nSince 1988, and especially over the past few years, the Jordanian government has been arbitrarily and without notice withdrawing Jordanian nationality from its citizens of Palestinian origin, making them stateless. As Human Rights Watch has stated, this is in direct violation of Jordan's nationality law of 1954 which provides that Palestinian residents of the West Bank in 1949 or thereafter received full Jordanian nationality following Jordan's incorporation of the West Bank in April 1950.\n\nPalestinians who moved from the West Bank (whether refugees or not) to Jordan, are issued yellow-ID cards to distinguish them from the Palestinians of the \"official 10 refugee camps\" in Jordan. From 1988 to 2012, thousands of those yellow-ID card Palestinians had their Jordanian citizenship revoked. Jordan's Interior Minister Nayef al-Kadi said: \"Our goal is to prevent Israel from emptying the Palestinian territories of their original inhabitants,\" the minister explained, confirming that the kingdom had begun revoking the citizenship of Palestinians.\n\n\"We should be thanked for taking this measure,\" he said. \"We are fulfilling our national duty because Israel wants to expel the Palestinians from their homeland.\"\n\nHuman Rights Watch estimated that about 2,700 Palestinians were stripped of Jordanian nationality between 2004 and 2008. It is estimated that over 40,000 Palestinians were affected by this policy.\n\nThe Jordanian government has said that these actions are akin to those of other Arab nations with the intention of helping Jordanians of Palestinian descent by requiring those who fled the West Bank or Jerusalem after the war in 1967 to keep their Israeli documents valid since the Israeli government continues to shift further right-wing under the leadership of its conservative foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman. Nabil Sharif, the former minister of state for media affairs and Jordanian ambassador to Morocco, said: \n\nIn 2012, the Jordanian government promised to stop revoking the citizenship of Palestinians, and restored citizenship to 4,500 Palestinians who had previously lost it.\n\nHowever, many have criticized the actions of the Jordanian government as an underhanded move to preserve the government's own interest by trying to appease non-Palestinian Jordanians concerned about the growing economic and political influence of citizens of Palestinian descent, which Nabil Sharif had denied.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "48622944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48622944", "title": "Margaret Crittendon Douglass", "text": "Margaret Crittendon Douglass\n\nMargaret Crittendon Douglass (born 1822; year of death unknown) was a Southern white woman who served one month in jail in 1854 for teaching free black children to read in Norfolk, Virginia. Refusing to hire a defense attorney, she defended herself in court and later published a book about her experiences. The case drew public attention to the highly restrictive laws against black literacy in the pre-Civil War American South.\n\nDouglass was born in 1822 in Washington, D.C., but moved in her childhood to Charleston, South Carolina, where she married. By age fourteen, she had given birth to a daughter, Hannah Rosa. She also birthed a son, who died. Nothing is known about her husband. In 1845, she and her daughter relocated to Norfolk, Virginia, where she established herself in a modest apartment in a tenement neighborhood and made ends meet by running her own business as a seamstress and vest maker. She chose not to participate in social activities with her white neighbors in the nearby tenements, who she felt were \"not of the most refined class\". She notes in her memoir that this made her unpopular in the neighborhood. She described her life as \"frugal and retiring\", and that it was \"necessary for me to labor incessantly\".\n\nIn 1853 she paid a business visit to the barber shop of a free black man named Robinson. Mr. Robinson was a man of influence in the community of more than 1500 free people of color who lived in Norfolk at that time. His two young sons were busy studying a reading primer, so Douglass asked Robinson if there wasn't a school in town where free black children could learn to read. Robinson said that there was only the Sunday school at Christ Church where, he said, \"they didn't learn much.\" Douglass returned home and asked her teenaged daughter, Hannah Rosa, if she would like to tutor the boys. Hannah Rosa said she would, and the boys began to receive free reading lessons at the Douglass home, using the books they received at church. Eventually, Robiinson took his sons back to the barber shop where he needed their help, and sent his two daughters instead. In her memoir, Douglass states that the two girls were intelligent, attentive, made rapid progress, and were \"a source of pleasure to us.\"\n\nA month later, Margaret and Hannah Rosa decided to open a small school for free black children in their home, and charge three dollars per student per quarter. Robinson spread word to the free black community, and the school was deluged with applications. For 11 months, they taught 25 children, who Douglass described as \"well-behaved\" and \"anxious to be taught\". When one of her female students grew ill, Douglass made regular visits to her home, and arranged for and participated in the girl's funeral when she died. This, according to Douglass, was not approved of by other whites in the community.\n\nOn the morning of May 9, 1853, while Hannah Rosa and the children were assembled at their desks, two police officers stationed themselves at the front and back door of her house. They informed Margaret and Hannah Rosa that teaching free black children was illegal under Virginia law, then took the two women and the twenty-five terrified children on foot to the mayor's office. This 1849 law, like similar ones throughout the South, was the result of Southern white panic following Nat Turner's Rebellion in 1831. Under this law, it was an 'unlawful assembly' for black people to gather together to learn to read and write, punishable by whipping, and for any white person to instruct them, punishable by up to 100 dollars and six months in jail.\n\n\"You have a very large family\", Mayor Stubbs commented when she and the 25 children arrived at his office. He then asked her if she was aware of the law. Douglass responded that she didn't know teaching free black children was illegal, but that if it were illegal for her to teach the children it should also be illegal for the church to do it, since she was using the same books. The mayor dismissed the matter and sent everyone home, after assuring Douglass that nothing would happen to the black children or their families.\n\nOutside the courtroom, Douglass noted that she was met by a group of free black adults, parents of the children and their friends, waiting to hear the decision and offering to pay for any penalties or bail she might incur. \nShe gathered the children back at the school, gave them back their books and slates, and said goodbye. \"It was a sad parting\", she wrote in her memoir.\n\nAfter her daughter Hannah Rosa left Norfolk for New York on June 29, Douglas was left alone, receiving however frequent gifts of flowers from her former students who stopped by to see her.\n\nOf the outpouring of support she received from the black community. Douglas writes, \"In my opinion, those who call the Southern Negroes ungrateful are only those who never do anything to call forth that emotion...May I ask what gratitude they owe to those who would degrade them? What gratitude does that child owe to his own father, who would coldly sell him as a slave?\"\n\nAlthough she thought the case was now behind her, on July 13, she was served legal papers for a Grand Jury Indictment for her and her 17-year-old daughter, which stated: \"Each of them did unlawfully assemble with diver negros, for the purpose of instructing them to read and to write, and did instruct them to read and to write, contrary to the act of the General Assembly, in such case made and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth of Virginia'.\n\nHaving little money and 'little affection for lawyers', Douglass decided to defend herself. She did not mention the upcoming trial to her daughter, who was still in New York, until September 1, when she instructed her to stay until further notice. On November 11, she entered the crowded courtroom alone, wearing a black velvet dress, white kid gloves and a plain straw bonnet. 'Everyone present seemed to be confused, except myself,' she noted.\n\nShe called three male members of Christ's Church as her witnesses, two of them also lawyers, one who had signed the summons against her. The excitement in the courtroom when these three witnesses arrived was 'most intense', she noted. In her memoir, she states that these men, who she describes as part of the 'aristocracy' of Norfolk, were either lecturers at the church's Sunday school, or had wives and daughters who were, and had given the free black children of the community the same books she was using to teach them to read. The witnesses either denied teaching altogether or said they had only provided moral and religious instruction, but did not teach the black children how to read and write.\n\nIn her closing speech to the jury, Douglass described herself as a Southern woman, a former slave-holder. She said she was not against slavery, and strongly opposed to northern abolitionist interference, though she believed their 'principles are based on a religious foundation'. She believed, she said, in 'the duty of every Southerner, morally and religiously to instruct his slaves, that they may know their duties to their masters and their common God. Let the masters first do their duty to them, for they are still our slaves and servants, whether bond or free, and can be nothing else in our community.' She also challenged the indifference of the white population towards the situation of the free and enslaved black population, where there was misery, starvation, and harsh laws in place to control them, noting that it was illegal for more than two or three of them to assemble in one place, for whatever reason.\n\n'When they are sick, or in want, on whom does the duty devolve to seek them out and administer to their necessities? Does it fall upon you, gentlemen? Oh no, it is not expected that gentlemen will take the trouble to seek out a negro hut for the purpose of alleviating the wretchedness he may find within it. Why then persecute your benevolent ladies for doing that which you yourselves have so long neglected? Shall we treat our slaves with less compassion than we do the cattle in the field?\"\n\nShe also told the jury that although they had nothing to fear from the 'true blooded' negroes, she felt that those who had 'white blood in their veins' were 'presumptuous, treacherous, and revengeful.' \"Ask how that white blood got beneath those tawny skins,\" she suggested, \"and let nature herself account for the exhibition of these instincts. Blame the authors of this devilish mischief, but not the victims of it.\"\n\nIn closing, she offered that she was willing to go to prison if she had to, but that the black anti-literacy law, she said, was 'one of the most inhuman and unjust laws that ever disgraced the statute book of a civilized community.' \n\nWhen she rested her case, the judge asked if anyone wanted to speak in her favor. No one came forward.\n\nDouglass successfully argued for dropping the charges against Hannah Rosa, since she was still a minor. At the close of the trial, the jury deliberated for two days, found her guilty, and fined her one dollar. She then left for New York to retrieve her daughter.\n\nOn January 10, 1854, she was called back before Judge Baker for further sentencing.\n\nThe Judge noted that some people in Norfolk were opposed to the law, and chided her for 'the indiscreet freedom with which you spoke of the colored race in general'. 'Such opinions I regard as manifestly mischievous', he said. The Church officials, he said, were allowed to instruct the children because religious instruction is necessary for black people. Black literacy, however, is dangerous. He described the law as a \"matter of self-defense against Northern anti-slavery agitators who clog the mail with anti-slavery pamphlets to be distributed among Southern Negroes to induce them to cut our throats,\" and who \"scattered pocket handkerchiefs around with anti-slavery engravings to work upon the feelings and ignorance of our negroes, who otherwise would remain comfortable and happy\". He also admonished her for speaking directly and honestly in her own defense instead of hiring an attorney, which would have allowed her case to have been presented in a 'far more favorable light'. Her 'bold and open opposition', he said, 'is a matter not to be slightly regarded' and 'something more substantial is required in this case'.\n\n'For these reasons', he continued, 'as an example to all others in like cases disposed to offend, and in vindication of the policy and justness of our laws, which every individual should be taught to respect, the judgment of the Court is, in addition to the proper fine and costs, that you be imprisoned for the period of one month in the jail of this city'.\n\nDouglass served out her sentence. Having no where else to stay when she was released, the jailer and his wife put her up for two days before she moved with her daughter to Philadelphia.\n\nThe case received substantial media coverage at the time, both for and against Douglass and the anti-literacy law. Under the headline \"Her Own Lawyer,\" an editor in the \"Petersburg Daily Express\" wrote of how the courtroom was 'filled with persons anxious to witness the novel spectacle' of a woman defending herself and compared her speech making abilities to renowned feminists like Lucy Stone. Despite her disavowal of abolitionism, she was hailed as a heroine by abolitionists. William Lloyd Garrison, in his abolitionist newspaper, \"The Liberator\", noted that a Quaker woman in Norfolk had delivered a sermon on Douglass' behalf while Douglass was in jail and stated, \"The women are a great trouble to our Norfolk neighbors\", he said. \"If they want peace, they will have to expel all Christian women... from the city.\" \n\nThe editor of the Virginia newspaper \"The Argus\" wrote that although the Norfolk community was reluctant to put a white woman in prison, 'there rose a righteous indignation towards a person who would throw contempt in the face of our laws, and brave the imprisonment for 'the cause of humanity' '.\n\n'Let her depart hence with only one wish, that her presence will never be intruded upon us again. Let her seek her associates at the North, and with them commingle, but let us put a check to such mischievous views as fell from her lips last November, sentiments unworthy of a resident of the State, and in direct rebellion against our Constitution\", he wrote.\n\nIn the religious publication \"Covenanter: Devoted to the Principles of the Reformed Presbyterian Church\", (Volume 9, 1853) David Smith called upon the Presbyterian General Assembly to intercede with the U.S. government to \"secure for all its citizens the rights of teaching human beings to read the language of their country...\" He noted that the United States government had interceded when Presbyterian women had been imprisoned in foreign Catholic countries for passing out Bibles, but would not intervene in Douglas's case.\n\nThe case, Smith said, has \"exposed the country to the contempt and hissing of every civilized country on earth\".\n\nIn 1854, Douglass published her memoir of the event, \"Educational Laws of Virginia: The Personal Narrative of Mrs. Margaret Douglass, a Southern Woman, who was Imprisoned for One Month in the Common Jail of Norfolk, Under the Laws of Virginia, for the Crime of Teaching Free Colored Children to Read.\" In it, she describes the trial as well as the events that led up to it, and includes the speech she made in her own self-defense. As she did in her courtroom speech, she criticizes the black literacy and assembly laws as well as white indifference to the situation of blacks, but identifies herself as a Southern supporter of slavery, and a white supremacist:\n\n\"I have been a slaveholder myself, and, if circumstances rendered it necessary or practicable, I might be such again\".\n\nPointing out that many of the black and mixed race children she was teaching were the children of the same white men who aided in the prosecution against her, she lays some of the blame for the condition of black people on Southern white men who sexually abused enslaved black women. This, she believed, is the root of the anti-literacy law. \"How important then for these Southern Sultans that the objects of their criminal passions should be kept in utter ignorance and degradation\", she writes. She speaks of the silent frustration of white women who know of their husbands' 'tawny mistresses' and the powerlessness of black women, who have \"parents, brothers, sisters, a lover perhaps, all of whom suffer through and with her, and in whose hearts spring up roots of bitterness which are destined to grow into trees whose branches will sooner or later overshadow the whole land.\" She ends her memoir calling upon her white \"Southern sisters\" to remedy this situation:\n\n\"I know my Southern sisters well enough to believe that they will not much longer rest tamely under the influence of this damning curse. I have told them plainly of the evil. The remedy is in their hands\".\n\nLittle is known about Margaret Douglass's life after her trial.\n\nIn June 1865 the members of the free black community of Norfolk, Virginia petitioned the federal government to abolish the restrictive literacy and assembly laws that were still in place in their community. The law was abolished in 1867.\n\nDocuments and publications about Douglass's trial and her subsequent memoir have helped shed light on the era she lived in for scholars of American history, race relations, women's history, religion and law. One legal scholar wrote that with the case of Margaret Douglass: \"The modern era of Anglo-American Law had arrived early, and the principal actor had been, appropriately, a woman. Her jury speech had, appropriately, employed the female metaphor of the family, in which all the children deserved equality of treatment. It was a metaphor, and an idea, that would come to dominate the legal discourse of America.\" \n\n"}

Psychology is the key to our success. On the other hand, various media can impact great masses of people.

Optimistic thinking enables us to make the difference together.\n\n\"Let we develop positivism as a new ideology - and the only one that can’t hurt anybody. Let’s alter use of media for the greater reason\", said Ljubisa Bojic during a gathering of Serbian Strengths Movement supporters in Kragujevac on 24 February 2007. He said, this proposition would be introduced to the international community at the Young Democratic Leaders Network summit in Istanbul (2007).\n\nPolitical positivism abides by this philosophy:\n\nCreative media use in needed for education, to increment people rather than to amuse.

{"id": "164663", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=164663", "title": "Prefect", "text": "Prefect\n\nPrefect (from the Latin \"praefectus\", substantive adjectival form of \"praeficere\": \"put in front\", i.e., in charge) is a magisterial title of varying definition, but which, basically, refers to the leader of an administrative area.\n\nA prefect's office, department, or area of control is called a prefecture, but in various post-Roman empire cases there is a prefect without a prefecture or \"vice versa\". The words \"prefect\" and \"prefecture\" are also used, more or less conventionally, to render analogous words in other languages, especially Romance languages.\n\n\"Praefectus\", often with a further qualification, was the formal title of many, fairly low to high-ranking, military or civil officials in the Roman Empire, whose authority was not embodied in their person (as it was with elected Magistrates) but conferred by delegation from a higher authority. They did have some authority in their prefecture such as controlling prisons and in civil administration.\n\nThe Praetorian prefect (\"Praefectus praetorio\") began as the military commander of a general's guard company in the field, then grew in importance as the Praetorian Guard became a potential kingmaker during the Empire. From the Emperor Diocletian's tetrarchy (c. 300) they became the administrators of the four Praetorian prefectures, the government level above the (newly created) dioceses and (multiplied) provinces.\n\n\n\nFor some auxiliary troops, specific titles could even refer to their peoples:\n\nRoman provinces were usually ruled by high-rank officials. Less important provinces though were entrusted to prefects, military men who would otherwise only govern parts of larger provinces. The most famous example is Pontius Pilate, who governed Judaea at a time when it was administered as an annex of Syria.\n\nAs Egypt was a special imperial domain, a rich and strategic granary, where the Emperor enjoyed an almost pharaonic position unlike any other province or diocese, its head was styled uniquely \"Praefectus Augustalis\", indicating that he governed in the personal name of the emperor, the \"Augustus\". Septimius Severus, after conquering Mesopotamia, introduced the same system there too.\n\nAfter the mid-1st century, as a result of the Pax Romana, the governorship was gradually shifted from the military prefects to civilian fiscal officials called procurators, Egypt remaining the exception.\n\n\nEspecially in Medieval Latin, \"præfectus\" was used to refer to various officers—administrative, military, judicial, etc.—usually alongside a more precise term in the vernacular (such as \"Burggraf\", which literally means \"Count of the Castle\" in the German language).\n\nThe term is used by the Roman Catholic Church, which based much of its canon law terminology on Roman law, in several different ways.\n\n\nMany college preparatory boarding schools utilize the position of Prefect as a high student leadership position.\n\n\nIn the 1980s, under the presidency of François Mitterrand (1981-1995), a fundamental change in the role of the prefect (and sub-prefect) took place. The previously extremely centralized French (Fifth) Republic was gradually \"decentralized\" by the creation of the Regions and the devolution of central state powers towards the \"Régions\", \"Départements\" and \"Communes\" (municipalities). New elected authorities were created (e.g. the \"Conseils régionaux\") in order to administrate the subdivisional entities (\"collectivités territoriales\") of the nation (law from 2 March 1982). \nThe changes have gradually altered the function of the prefect. He is still the supreme representative of the state in a département, but has lost his omnipotent function of chief administrator. Instead, he has acquired the roles of chief controller (not a title) of regional, departemental and communal public accounts and of chief inspector (not a title) of good (i.e. law-abiding) governance of the authorities of the respective territorial entities.\n\nA \"Préfet maritime\" is a French Admiral (\"Amiral\") who is commissioned to be the chief commander of a \"Zone maritime\" (i.e. a section of the French territorial waters and the respective shores).\n\nIn Paris, the \"Préfet de police\" (prefect of police) is the head of the city's police under the direct authority of the \"Ministre de l'Intérieur\" (Minister of the Interior), which makes him unique as usually in French towns and cities the chief of the local police is subordinated to the \"maire\" (mayor), who is the local representative of the minister in police matters.\n\n\nThe Prefect of Police (\"Préfet de police)\" is the officer in charge of co-ordinating police forces in Paris (see above under \"France\"). The local police in Japan are divided among prefectures too.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3009396", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3009396", "title": "Rational basis review", "text": "Rational basis review\n\nIn U.S. constitutional law, rational basis review is the normal standard of review that courts apply when considering constitutional questions, including due process or equal protection questions under the Fifth Amendment or Fourteenth Amendment. Courts applying rational basis review seek to determine whether a law is \"rationally related\" to a \"legitimate\" government interest, whether real or hypothetical. The higher levels of scrutiny are intermediate scrutiny and strict scrutiny. Heightened scrutiny is applied where a suspect or quasi-suspect classification is involved, or a fundamental right is implicated.\n\nIn United States Supreme Court jurisprudence, the nature of the interest at issue determines the level of scrutiny applied by appellate courts. When courts engage in rational basis review, only the most egregious enactments, those not rationally related to a legitimate government interest, are overturned.\n\nRational basis review tests whether the government's actions are \"rationally related\" to a \"legitimate\" government interest. The Supreme Court has never set forth standards for determining what constitutes a legitimate government interest. Under rational basis review, it is \"entirely irrelevant\" what end the government is actually seeking and statutes can be based on \"rational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data.\" Rather, if the court can merely hypothesize a \"legitimate\" interest served by the challenged action, it will withstand rational basis review. Judges following the Supreme Court's instructions understand themselves to be \"obligated to seek out other conceivable reasons for validating\" challenged laws if the government is unable to justify its own policies.\n\nThe concept of rational basis review can be traced to an influential 1893 article, \"The Origin and Scope of American Constitutional Law,\" by Harvard law professor James Bradley Thayer. Thayer argued that statutes should be invalidated only if their unconstitutionality is \"so clear that it is not open to rational question.\" Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., a student of Thayer's, articulated a version of what would become rational basis review in his canonical dissent in \"Lochner v. New York\", arguing that \"the word 'liberty,' in the 14th Amendment, is perverted when it is held to prevent the natural outcome of a dominant opinion, unless it can be said that a rational and fair man necessarily would admit that the statute proposed would infringe fundamental principles as they have been understood by the traditions of our people and our law.\"\n\nHowever, the court's extensive application of economic substantive due process during the years following Lochner meant that Holmes' proposed doctrine of judicial deference to state interest was not immediately adopted. It was not until \"Nebbia v. New York\" that the Court began to formally apply rational basis review, when it stated that \"a State is free to adopt whatever economic policy may reasonably be deemed to promote public welfare, and to enforce that policy by legislation adapted to its purpose.\" In \"United States v. Carolene Products Co.\" the Court in Footnote Four left open the possibility that laws that seem to be within \"a specific prohibition of the Constitution,\" which restrict the political process, or which burden \"discrete and insular minorities\" might receive more exacting review. Today, such laws receive strict scrutiny, whereas laws implicating unenumerated rights that the Supreme Court has not recognized as fundamental receive rational basis review.\n\nIn modern constitutional law, the rational basis test is applied to constitutional challenges of both federal law and state law (via the Fourteenth Amendment). This test also applies to both legislative and executive action whether those actions be of a substantive or procedural nature.\n\nThe rational basis test prohibits the government from imposing restrictions on liberty that are irrational or arbitrary, or drawing distinctions between persons in a manner that serves no constitutionally legitimate end. While a \"law enacted for broad and ambitious purposes often can be explained by reference to legitimate public policies which justify the incidental disadvantages they impose on certain persons\", it must nevertheless, at least, \"bear a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental purpose\".\n\nTo understand the concept of rational basis review, it is easier to understand what it is not. Rational basis review is \"not\" a genuine effort to determine the legislature's actual reasons for enacting a statute, nor to inquire into whether a statute does in fact further a legitimate end of government. A court applying rational basis review will virtually always uphold a challenged law unless every conceivable justification for it is a grossly illogical non sequitur. In 2008, Justice John Paul Stevens reaffirmed the lenient nature of rational basis review in a concurring opinion: \"[A]s I recall my esteemed former colleague, Thurgood Marshall, remarking on numerous occasions: 'The Constitution does not prohibit legislatures from enacting stupid laws.'\"\n\n"}
{"id": "34641034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34641034", "title": "Reference Re Assisted Human Reproduction Act", "text": "Reference Re Assisted Human Reproduction Act\n\nReference Re Assisted Human Reproduction Act is an appeal from the Quebec Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada on a reference question posed as to the constitutional validity of the \"Assisted Human Reproduction Act\" that had been passed by the Parliament of Canada.\n\nThe Court of Appeal was asked by the Government of Quebec to answer the following question:\n\nThe Court ruled in the affirmative in some respects of the question.\n\nThe appeal was allowed in part, with the Court rendering a rare 4-4-1 mixed decision. The justices' opinions were as follows:\n\nThe Act is essentially a series of prohibitions, followed by a set of subsidiary provisions for their administration. While the Act will have beneficial effects and while some of its effects may impact on provincial matters, neither its dominant purpose nor its dominant effect is to set up a regime that regulates and promotes the benefits of artificial reproduction. Here, the matter of the statutory scheme, viewed as a whole, is a valid exercise of the federal power over criminal law. The dominant purpose and effect of the legislative scheme is to prohibit practices that would undercut moral values, produce public health evils, and threaten the security of donors, donees, and persons conceived by assisted reproduction.\n\nThe impugned provisions represent an overflow of the exercise of the federal criminal law power. Their pith and substance is connected with the provinces’ exclusive jurisdiction over hospitals, property and civil rights, and matters of a merely local nature. The impugned provisions affect rules with respect to the management of hospitals, since Parliament has provided that the Act applies to all premises in which controlled activities are undertaken. Furthermore, the fact that several of the impugned provisions concern subjects that are already governed by the Civil Code of Quebec and other Quebec legislation is an important indication that in pith and substance, the provisions lie at the very core of the provinces’ jurisdiction over civil rights and local matters.\n\nThe matter of the impugned provisions is regulation of virtually every aspect of research and clinical practice in relation to assisted human reproduction. The matter of the challenged provisions is best classified as relating to the establishment, maintenance and management of hospitals, property and civil rights in the province and matters of a merely local or private nature in the province. However, ss. 8, 9 and 12 in purpose and effect prohibit negative practices associated with assisted reproduction and fall within the traditional ambit of the federal criminal law power. Similarly, ss. 40(1), (6) and (7), 41 to 43, and 44(1) and (4) set up the mechanisms to implement s. 12 and, to the extent that they relate to provisions of the Act which are constitutional, were properly enacted by Parliament. Sections 45 to 53, to the extent that they deal with inspection and enforcement in relation to constitutionally valid provisions of the Act, are also properly enacted under the criminal law power. The same is true for ss. 60 and 61, which create offences. Section 68 is also constitutional, although its operation will be limited to constitutional sections of the Act. Given that the other provisions establishing the Assisted Human Reproduction Agency of Canada are not contested, there is no constitutional objection to s. 19.\n"}

The USA PATRIOT Act was passed by the United States Congress in 2001 as a response to the September 11, 2001 attacks. Title II: Enhanced Surveillance Procedures gave increased powers of surveillance to various government agencies and bodies. This title has 25 sections, with one of the sections (section 224) containing a sunset clause which sets an expiration date, 31 December 2005, for most of the title's provisions. On 22 December 2005, the sunset clause expiration date was extended to 3 February 2006.\n\nTitle II contains many of the most contentious provisions of the act. Supporters of the Patriot Act claim that these provisions are necessary in fighting the War on Terrorism, while its detractors argue that many of the sections of Title II infringe upon individual and civil rights.\n\nThe sections of Title II amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 and its provisions in 18 U.S.C., dealing with \"Crimes and Criminal Procedure\". It also amends the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986. In general, the Title expands federal agencies' powers in intercepting, sharing, and using private telecommunications, especially electronic communications, along with a focus on criminal investigations by updating the rules that govern computer crime investigations. It also sets out procedures and limitations for individuals who feel their rights have been violated to seek redress, including against the United States government. However, it also includes a section that deals with trade sanctions against countries whose government supports terrorism, which is not directly related to surveillance issues.\n\nTwo sections dealt with the interception of communications by the United States government.\n\nSection 201 is titled \"Authority to intercept wire, oral, and electronic communications relating to terrorism\". This section amended (Authorization for interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications) of the United States Code. This section allows (under certain specific conditions) the United States Attorney General (or some of his subordinates) to authorize a Federal judge to make an order authorizing or approving the interception of wire or oral communications by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), or another relevant U.S. Federal agency.\n\nThe Attorney General's subordinates who can use Section 201 are: the Deputy Attorney General, the Associate Attorney General, any Assistant Attorney General, any acting Assistant Attorney General, any Deputy Assistant Attorney General or acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Criminal Division who is specially designated by the Attorney General.\n\nThe amendment added a further condition which allowed an interception order to be carried out. The interception order may now be made if a criminal violation is made with respect to terrorism (defined by ):\n\nNote: the legislation states that title 18, section 2516(1), paragraph (p) of the United States Code was redesignated (moved) to become paragraph (q). This paragraph had been previously redesignated by two other pieces of legislation: the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 and by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (see section 201(3)).\n\nSection 202 is titled \"Authority to intercept wire, oral, and electronic communications relating to computer fraud and abuse offenses\", and amended the United States Code to include computer fraud and abuse in the list of reasons why an interception order may be granted.\n\nSection 203 (\"Authority to share criminal investigation information\") modified the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure with respect to disclosure of information before the grand jury (Rule 6(e)). Section 203(a) allowed the disclosure of matters in deliberation by the grand jury, which are normally otherwise prohibited, if:\n203(a) gave the court the power to order a time within which information may be disclosed, and specified when a government agency may use information disclosed about a foreign power. The rules of criminal procedure now state that \"within a reasonable time after such disclosure, an attorney for the government shall file under seal a notice with the court stating the fact that such information was disclosed and the departments, agencies, or entities to which the disclosure was made.\"\n\nSection 203(b) modified , which details who is allowed to learn the results of a communications interception, to allow any investigative or law enforcement officer, or attorney for the Government to divulge foreign intelligence, counterintelligence or foreign intelligence information to a variety of Federal officials. Specifically, any official who has obtained knowledge of the contents of any wire, oral, or electronic communication, or evidence derived from this could divulge this information to any Federal law enforcement, intelligence, protective, immigration, national defense, or national security official. The definition of \"foreign intelligence\" was the same as section 203(a), with the same ability to define \"foreign intelligence\" to be intelligence of a non-U.S. and U.S. citizen. The information received must only be used as necessary in the conduct of the official's official duties.\n\nThe definition of \"foreign intelligence information\" is defined again in Section 203(d).\n\nSection 203(c) specified that the Attorney General must establish procedures for the disclosure of information due to (see above), for those people who are defined as U.S. citizens.\n\nSection 204 (\"Clarification of intelligence exceptions from limitations on interception and disclosure of wire, oral, and electronic communication\") removed restrictions from the acquisition of foreign intelligence information from international or foreign communications. It was also clarified that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 should not only be the sole means of electronic surveillance for just oral and wire intercepts, but should also include electronic communication.\n\nUnder section 205 (\"Employment of translators by the Federal Bureau of Investigation\"), the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation is now allowed to employ translators to support counterterrorism investigations and operations without regard to applicable Federal personnel requirements and limitations. However, he must report to the House Judiciary Committee and Senate Judiciary Committee the number of translators employed and any legal reasons why he cannot employ translators from federal, state, or local agencies.\n\nThe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 allows an applicant access to all information, facilities, or technical assistance necessary to perform electronic surveillance on a particular target. The assistance given must protect the secrecy of and cause as little disruption to the ongoing surveillance effort as possible. The direction could be made at the request of the applicant of the surveillance order, by a common carrier, landlord, custodian or other specified person. Section 206 (\"Roving surveillance authority under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978\") amended this to add:\n\nor in circumstances where the Court finds that the actions of the target of the application may have the effect of thwarting the identification of a particular person.\n\nThis allows intelligence agencies to undertake \"roving\" surveillance: they do not have to specify the exact facility or location where their surveillance will be done. Roving surveillance was already specified for criminal investigations under , and section 206 brought the ability of intelligence agencies to undertake such roving surveillance into line with such criminal investigations. However, the section was not without controversy, as James X. Dempsey, the Executive Director of the Center for Democracy & Technology, argued that a few months after the Patriot Act was passed the Intelligence Authorization Act was also passed that had the unintended effect of seeming to authorize \"John Doe\" roving taps — FISA orders that identify neither the target nor the location of the interception (see The Patriot Debates, James X. Dempsey debates Paul Rosenzweig on section 206).\n\nPreviously FISA only defined the duration of a surveillance order against a foreign power (defined in ) . This was amended by section 207 (\"Duration of FISA surveillance of non-United States persons who are agents of a foreign power\") to allow surveillance of agents of a foreign power (as defined in section ) for a maximum of 90 days. Section 304(d)(1) was also amended to extend orders for physical searches from 45 days to 90 days, and orders for physical searches against agents of a foreign power are allowed for a maximum of 120 days. The act also clarified that extensions for surveillance could be granted for a maximum of a year against agents of a foreign power.\n\nSection 103(A) of FISA was amended by Section 208 (\"Designation of judges\") of the Patriot Act to increase the number of federal district court judges who must now review surveillance orders from seven to 11. Of these, three of the judges must live within of the District of Columbia.\n\nSection 209 (\"Seizure of voice-mail messages pursuant to warrants\") removed the text \"any electronic storage of such communication\" from title 18, section 2510 of the United States Code. Before this was struck from the Code, the U.S. government needed to apply for a title III wiretap order before they could open voice-mails; however, now the government only need apply for an ordinary search. Section 2703, which specifies when a \"provider of electronic communication services\" must disclose the contents of stored communications, was also amended to allow such a provider to be compelled to disclose the contents via a search warrant, and not a wiretap order. According to Vermont senator Patrick Leahy, this was done to \"harmonizing the rules applicable to stored voice and non-voice (e.g., e-mail) communications\".\n\nThe U.S. Code specifies when the U.S. government may require a provider of an electronic communication service to hand over communication records. It specifies what that provider must disclose to the government, and was amended by section 210 (\"Scope of subpoenas for records of electronic communications\") to include records of session times and durations of electronic communication as well as any identifying numbers or addresses of the equipment that was being used, even if this may only be temporary. For instance, this would include temporarily assigned IP addresses, such as those established by DHCP.\n\nSection 211 (\"Clarification of scope\") further clarified the scope of such orders. (Section 631 of the Communications Act of 1934) deals with the privacy granted to users of cable TV. The code was amended to allow the government to have access to the records of cable customers, with the notable exclusion of records revealing cable subscriber selection of video programming from a cable operator.\n\nSection 212 (\"Emergency disclosure of electronic communications to protect life and limb\") amended the US Code to stop a communications provider from providing communication records (not necessarily relating to the content itself) about a customer's communications to others. However, should the provider reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person then the communications provider can now disclose this information. The act did not make clear what \"reasonably\" meant.\n\nA communications provider could also disclose communications records if:\n\nThis section was repealed by the Homeland Security Act of 2002 — this act also created the Homeland Security Department — and was replaced with a new and permanent emergency disclosure provision.\n\nSection 213 (\"Authority for delaying notice of the execution of a warrant\") amended the US Code to allow the notification of search warrants to be delayed.\nThis section has been commonly referred to as the \"sneak and peek\" section, a phrase originating from the FBI and not, as commonly believed, from opponents of the Patriot Act. The U.S. government may now legally search and seize property that constitutes evidence of a United States criminal offense without immediately telling the owner. The court may only order the delayed notification if they have reason to believe it would hurt an investigation — delayed notifications were already defined in — or, if a search warrant specified that the subject of the warrant must be notified \"within a reasonable period of its execution,\" then it allows the court to extend the period before the notification is given, though the government must show \"good cause\". If the search warrant prohibited the seizure of property or communications, then the search warrant could then be delayed.\n\nBefore the Patriot Act was enacted, there were three cases before the United States district courts: \"United States v. Freitas\", 800 F.2d 1451 (9th Cir. 1986); \"United States v. Villegas\", 899 F.2d 1324 (2d Cir. 1990); and \"United States v. Simons\", 206 F.3d 392 (4th Cir. 2000). Each determined that, under certain circumstances, it was not unconstitutional to delay the notification of search warrants.\n\nFISA was amended by section 214 (\"Pen register and trap and trace authority under FISA\") to clarify that pen register and trap and trace surveillance can be authorised to allow government agencies to gather foreign intelligence information. Where the law only allowed them to gather surveillance if there was evidence of international terrorism, it now gives the courts the power to grant trap and traces against:\n\nAny investigation against U.S. citizens must not violate the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\nThis section is commonly referred to as the \"library records\" provision because of the wide range of personal material that can be investigated.\n\nFISA was modified by section 215 (\"Access to records and other items under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act\") of the Act to allow the Director of the FBI (or an official designated by the Director, so long as that official's rank is no lower than Assistant Special Agent in Charge) to apply for an order to produce materials that assist in an investigation undertaken to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities. The Act gives an example to clarify what it means by \"tangible things\": it includes \"books, records, papers, documents, and other items\".\n\nIt is specified that any such investigation must be conducted in accordance with guidelines laid out in Executive Order 12333 (which pertains to United States intelligence activities). Investigations must also not be performed on U.S. citizens who are carrying out activities protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n\nAny order that is granted must be given by a FISA court judge or by a magistrate judge who is publicly designated by the Chief Justice of the United States to allow such an order to be given. Any application must prove that it is being conducted without violating the First Amendment rights of any U.S. citizens. The application can \"only\" be used to obtain foreign intelligence information not concerning a U.S. citizen or to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities.\n\nThis section of the USA PATRIOT Act is controversial because the order may be granted \"ex parte\", and once it is granted — in order to avoid jeopardizing the investigation — the order may not disclose the reasons behind why the order was granted.\n\nThe section carries a gag order stating that \"No person shall disclose to any other person (other than those persons necessary to produce the tangible things under this section) that the Federal Bureau of Investigation has sought or obtained tangible things under this section\". Senator Rand Paul stated that the non-disclosure is imposed for one year, though this is not explicitly mentioned in the section.\n\nIn order to protect anyone who complies with the order, FISA now prevents any person who complies with the order in \"good faith\" from being liable for producing any tangible goods required by the court order. The production of tangible items is not deemed to constitute a waiver of any privilege in any other proceeding or context.\n\nAs a safeguard, section 502 of FISA compels the Attorney General to inform the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives and the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate of all such orders granted. In a semi-annual basis, the Attorney General must also provide a report to the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and the Senate which details the total number of applications over the previous 6 months made for orders approving requests for the production of tangible things and the total number of such orders either granted, modified, or denied.\n\nThis section was reauthorized in 2011.\n\nDuring a House Judiciary hearing on domestic spying on July 17, 2013 John C. Inglis, the deputy director of the surveillance agency, told a member of the House judiciary committee that NSA analysts can perform \"a second or third hop query\" through its collections of telephone data and internet records in order to find connections to terrorist organizations. \"Hops\" refers to a technical term indicating connections between people. A three-hop query means that the NSA can look at data not only from a suspected terrorist, but from everyone that suspect communicated with, and then from everyone those people communicated with, and then from everyone all of those people communicated with. NSA officials had said previously that data mining was limited to two hops, but Inglis suggested that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has allowed for data analysis extending \"two or three hops\".\n\nHowever, in 2015, the Second Circuit appeals court ruled in ACLU v. Clapper that Section 215 of the Patriot Act did not authorize the bulk collection of phone metadata, which judge Gerard E. Lynch called a \"staggering\" amount of information.\n\nOn May 20, 2015, Paul spoke for ten and a half hours in opposition to the reauthorization of Section 215 of the Patriot Act.\n\nAt midnight on May 31, 2015, Section 215 expired. With the passage of the USA Freedom Act on June 2, 2015 the expired parts of law, including Section 215, were reported broadly as restored and renewed through 2019. But, the USA Freedom Act did not explicitly state that it was restoring the expired provisions of Section 215. Since such renewal language is nowhere to be found, the law the version of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that existed on October 25, 2001, prior to changes brought by the USA Patriot Act, rendering much of the amendment language incoherent. How this legislative snafu will be fixed is not clear. The attempted amendments to Section 215 were intended to stop the NSA from continuing its mass phone data collection program. Instead, phone companies will retain the data and the NSA can obtain information about targeted individuals with permission from a federal court.\n\nSection 216 (\"Modification of authorities relating to use of pen registers and trap and trace devices\") deals with three specific areas with regards to pen registers and trap and trace devices: general limitations to the use of such devices, how an order allowing the use of such devices must be made, and the definition of such devices.\n\n details the exceptions related to the general prohibition on pen register and trap and trace devices. Along with gathering information for dialup communications, it allows for gathering routing and other addressing information. It is specifically limited to this information: the Act does \"not\" allow such surveillance to capture the actual information that is contained in the communication being monitored. However, organisations such as the EFF have pointed out that certain types of information that can be captured, such as URLs, can have content embedded in them. They object to the application of trap and trace and pen register devices to newer technology using a standard designed for telephones.\n\nIt also details that an order may be applied for \"ex parte\" (without the party it is made against present, which in itself is not unusual for search warrants), and allows the agency who applied for the order to compel any relevant person or entity providing wire or electronic communication service to assist with the surveillance. If the party whom the order is made against so requests, the attorney for the Government, law enforcement or investigative officer that is serving the order must provide written or electronic certification that the order applies to the targeted individual.\n\nIf a pen register or trap and trace device is used on a packet-switched data network, then the agency doing surveillance must keep a detailed log containing:\n\n\nThis information must be generated for the entire time the device is active, and must be provided \"ex parte\" and under seal to the court which entered the \"ex parte\" order authorizing the installation and use of the device. This must be done within 30 days after termination of the order.\n\nOrders must now include the following information:\n\nThis section amended the non-disclosure requirements of by expanding to include those whose facilities are used to establish the trap and trace or pen register or to those people who assist with applying the surveillance order who must not disclose that surveillance is being undertaken. Before this it had only applied to the person owning or leasing the line.\n\nThe following terms were redefined in the US Code's chapter 206 (which solely deals with pen registers and trap and trace devices):\n\nSection 217 (\"Interception of computer trespasser communications\") firstly defines the following terms:\n\nAmendments were made to to make it lawful to allow a person to intercept the communications of a computer trespasser if\n\nSection 218 (\"Foreign intelligence information\") amended and (both FISA sections 104(a) (7)(B) and section 303(a)(7)(B), respectively) to change \"the purpose\" of surveillance orders under FISA to gain access to foreign intelligence to \"significant purpose\". Mary DeRosa, in \"The Patriot Debates\", explained that the reason behind this was to remove a legal \"wall\" which arose when criminal and foreign intelligence overlapped. This was because the U.S. Department of Justice interpreted \"the purpose\" of surveillance was restricted to collecting information for foreign intelligence, which DeRosa says \"was designed to ensure that prosecutors and criminal investigators did not use FISA to circumvent the more rigorous warrant requirements for criminal cases\". However, she also says that it is debatable whether this legal tightening of the definition was even necessary, stating that \"the Department of Justice argued to the FISA Court of Review in 2002 that the original FISA standard did not require the restrictions that the Department of Justice imposed over the years, and the court appears to have agreed [which] leaves the precise legal effect of a sunset of section 218 somewhat murky.\"\n\nSection 219 (\"Single-jurisdiction search warrants for terrorism\") amended the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to allow a magistrate judge who is involved in an investigation of domestic terrorism or international terrorism the ability to issue a warrant for a person or property within or outside of their district.\n\nSection 220 (\"Nationwide service of search warrants for electronic evidence\") gives the power to Federal courts to issue nationwide service of search warrants for electronic surveillance. However, only courts with jurisdiction over the offense can order such a warrant. This required amending and .\n\nSection 221 (\"Trade sanctions\") amended the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000. This Act prohibits, except under certain specific circumstances, the President from imposing a unilateral agricultural sanction or unilateral medical sanction against a foreign country or foreign entity. The Act holds various exceptions to this prohibition, and the Patriot Act further amended the exceptions to include holding sanctions against countries that design, develop or produce chemical or biological weapons, missiles, or weapons of mass destruction. It also amended the act to include the Taliban as state sponsors of international terrorism. In amending Title IX, section 906 of the Trade sanctions act, the Taliban was determined by the Secretary of State to have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism and the export of agricultural commodities, medicine, or medical devices is now pursuant to one-year licenses issued and reviewed by the United States Government. However, the export of agricultural commodities, medicine, or medical devices to the Government of Syria or to the Government of North Korea were exempt from such a restriction.\n\nThe Patriot Act further states that nothing in the Trade Sanctions Act will limit the application of criminal or civil penalties to those who export agricultural commodities, medicine, or medical devices to:\n\nSection 222 (\"Assistance to law enforcement agencies\") states that nothing in the Patriot Act shall make a communications provider or other individual provide more technical assistance to a law enforcement agency than what is set out in the Act. It also allows for the reasonable compensation of any expenses incurred while assisting with the establishment of pen registers or trap and trace devices.\n\n allows any person who has had their rights violated due to the illegal interception of communications to take civil action against the offending party. Section 223 (\"Civil liability for certain unauthorized disclosures\") excluded the United States from such civil action.\n\nIf a court or appropriate department or agency determines that the United States or any of its departments or agencies has violated any provision of chapter 119 of the U.S. Code they may request an internal review from that agency or department. If necessary, an employee may then have administrative action taken against them. If the department or agency do not take action, then they must inform the notify the Inspector General who has jurisdiction over the agency or department, and they must give reasons to them why they did not take action.\n\nA citizen's rights will also be found to have been violated if an investigative, law enforcement officer or governmental entity discloses information beyond that allowed in .\n\nA totally new section was appended to Title 18, Chapter 121 of the US Code: Section 2712, \"Civil actions against the United States\". It allows people to take action against the US Government if they feel that they had their rights violated, as defined in chapter 121, chapter 119, or sections 106(a), 305(a), or 405(a) of FISA. The court may assess damages no less than $US10,000 and litigation costs that are reasonably incurred. Those seeking damages must present them to the relevant department or agency as specified in the procedures of the Federal Tort Claims Act.\n\nActions taken against the United States must be initiated within two years of when the claimant has had a reasonable chance to discover the violation. All cases are presented before a judge, not a jury. However, the court will order a stay of proceedings if they determine that if during the court case civil discovery will hurt the ability of the government to conduct a related investigation or the prosecution of a related criminal case. If the court orders the stay of proceedings they will extend the time period that a claimant has to take action on a reported violation. However, the government may respond to any action against it by submitting evidence \"ex parte\" in order to avoid disclosing any matter that may adversely affect a related investigation or a related criminal case. The plaintiff is then given an opportunity to make a submission to the court, not \"ex parte\", and the court may request further information from either party.\n\nIf a person wishes to discover or obtain applications or orders or other materials relating to electronic surveillance or to discover, obtain, or suppress evidence or information obtained or derived from electronic surveillance under FISA, then the Attorney General may file an affidavit under oath that disclosure or an adversary hearing would harm the national security of the United States. In these cases, the court may review \"in camera\" and \"ex parte\" the material relating to the surveillance to make sure that such surveillance was lawfully authorized and conducted. The court may then disclose part of material relating to the surveillance. However, the court is restricted in they may only do this \"where such disclosure is necessary to make an accurate determination of the legality of the surveillance\". If it then determined that the use of a pen register or trap and trace device was not lawfully authorized or conducted, the result of such surveillance may be suppressed as evidence. However, should the court determine that such surveillance was lawfully authorised and conducted, they may deny the motion of the aggrieved person.\n\nIt is further stated that if a court or appropriate department or agency determines that an officer or employee of the United States willfully or intentionally violated any provision of chapter 121 of the U.S. Code they will request an internal review from that agency or department. If necessary, an employee may then have administrative action taken against them. If the department or agency do not take action, then they must inform the notify the Inspector General who has jurisdiction over the agency or department, and they must give reasons to them why they did not take action. (see for a similar part of the Act)\n\nSection 224 (\"Sunset\") is a sunset clause. Title II and the amendments made by the title originally would have ceased to have effect on December 31, 2005, with the exception of the below sections. However, on December 22, 2005, the sunset clause expiration date was extended to February 3, 2006, and then on February 2, 2006 it was further extended to March 10:\n\nFurther, any particular foreign intelligence investigations that are ongoing will continue to be run under the expired sections.\n\nSection 225 (\"Immunity for compliance with FISA wiretap\") gives legal immunity to any provider of a wire or electronic communication service, landlord, custodian, or other person that provides any information, facilities, or technical assistance in accordance with a court order or request for emergency assistance. This was added to FISA as section 105 ().\n\n"}

The houses were built using a low-energy design. The idea and motivation for providing energy efficient living arrangements stems from the fact that fossil fuels contribute to global warming and that their use should therefore be avoided.\nPlanning of the project began in 1992. Since 1999, 1,300 apartments were gradually built during a 6-year period. The total cost of the project amounted to 190 million euros. Nearly two-thirds of which was used for the residential building, and only a third of the total cost was due to infrastructure.\n\nIn the centre of the town lie a bank, a supermarket, a tobacconist's and a coffee house. Community issues are being handled by the staff of the district office and the pastoral care/meeting centre. Children are taken care of in the family centre consisting of a kindergarten, a primary school and high school. A nursery will also be built in the future. In the north of solarCity there is also a recreational area. Since September 2005, the solarCity has been connected to the tram network. Using the public transport network it is possible to get to the city centre of Linz in less than 30 minutes.\n\nAt least one-third of the hot water used in the solarCity is generated by solar energy. The remaining two-thirds are covered by district heating (A district heating plant can provide higher efficiencies and better pollution control than localized boilers).\n\nThe wastewater will be disposed and treated in the separation system. While Gray water is locally managed through a sand bed filter planted and then led to a creek in the neighborhood, the black water is processed conventionally using a gravity sewer of the sewage treatment plant of the city Asten. \nPart of the wastewater will be separated across special toilets and collected in separate sewers. This nutrient-rich fluid is utilized as fertiliser in agriculture. \nLarger quantities of rain water have special channels or can be fed into the raceway in north of the solarCity.\n\nLinz\n\n\n"}

Campbell\n\nState Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408 (2003), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court held that the due process clause usually limits punitive damage awards to less than ten times the size of the compensatory damages awarded and that punitive damage awards of four times the compensatory damage award is \"close to the line of constitutional impropriety\".\n\nThe Court reached this conclusion applying guideposts first noted in \"BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore\", 517 U.S. 559 (1996), requiring courts to consider:\n\n\nThe matter involved Curtis Campbell, who was insured by State Farm.\n\nIn 1981, Campbell caused an accident in which Todd Ospital was killed and Robert G. Slusher was left permanently disabled, a fact confirmed by both witnesses to the accident and investigators.\n\nNotwithstanding the evidence against Campbell, State Farm decided to contest liability and decline the settlement offers from both Slusher and Ospital's estate (both parties were offering to settle for $25,000 each, or $50,000 total, which was the policy limit). State Farm assured the Campbells that \"their assets were safe, that they had no liability for the accident, that [State Farm] would represent their interests, and that they did not need to procure separate counsel.\"\n\nHowever, a jury rendered a verdict that Campbell was 100 percent liable for the accident and awarded a judgment of $185,849. \nState Farm refused to pay the excess amount, nor would it post a supersedeas bond to allow Campbell to appeal the verdict; Campbell obtained his own counsel to appeal the verdict.\n\nWhile the appeal was pending, in late 1984 the Campbells reached a settlement with Slusher and Ospital's estate, whereby those parties agreed not to seek satisfaction of the judgment against the Campbells, and the Campbells would pursue a bad-faith action against State Farm. The attorneys for Slusher and Ospital's estate would represent the Campbells in the bad-faith suit and would make all major decisions regarding it. No settlement would take effect without the approval of Slusher and Ospital's estate, who would receive 90 percent of any verdict against State Farm.\n\nIn 1989 the Utah Supreme Court denied Campbell's appeal. State Farm then paid the entire amount of the judgment including the excess amount. Nevertheless, the Campbells filed suit against State Farm alleging bad faith, fraud, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\nInitially the trial court granted summary judgment for State Farm as it had paid the entire amount of the judgment, but the ruling was reversed on appeal.\n\nThe Utah Supreme Court reinstated a $145 million punitive verdict against State Farm, noting that an earlier $100 million judgment had gone unreported to State Farm's corporate headquarters, and that the regional vice president had no plans to report the judgment under review, despite the judgment being substantially based on evidence of national corporate policy.\n\nJustices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas adhered to their previously expressed views that the Due Process Clause and Constitution provide no protection against \"excessive\" punitive damage awards.\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg voted to leave intact the decision of the Utah Supreme Court. She expressed her view that the Supreme Court \"has no warrant to reform state law governing awards of punitive damages.\" Instead, Ginsburg wrote, while \"damage-capping \"legislation\" may be altogether fitting and proper\" (emphasis added), only \"a legislative scheme or a state high court\" is \"authorized\" to institute such a change in the law.\n\n"}
{"id": "10583827", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10583827", "title": "Supporting organization (charity)", "text": "Supporting organization (charity)\n\nA supporting organization, in the United States, is a public charity that operates under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code in 26 USCA 509(a)(3). A supporting organization either makes grants to, or performs the operations of, a public charity similar to a private foundation.\n\nHowever, unlike donations to a private foundation, donations to a supporting organization garner the same higher deduction rate as donations to public charities. However, supporting organizations allow less control over the organization to the founders than private foundations. The Internal Revenue Code calls a public charity that relies on a supporting organization a \"supported organization\".\n\nThe Tax Reform Act of 1969 created private foundations and imposed greater restrictions on this classification, including excise taxes and lower donor deductions for contributions. This Act created supporting organizations as an exception to private foundations—because they are organized, operated, and controlled in the public interest. Supporting organizations are not subject to the problems and abuses found in foundations that led to the creation and associated restrictions on private foundations.\n\nMostly large and medium-sized donors created supporting organizations in order to retain some control over their donated assets. Type III supporting organizations comprised the sort of supporting organization with the least surveillance by the supported organizations, which meant greater donor control, and so Type III supporting organizations quickly became the favored form.\n\nDespite this flexibility, few donors outside of high and middle-high value donors created supporting organizations due to complex regulations and tax code provisions governing the formation and operation of supporting organizations. This entailed high transaction costs. Further, the demands of the tax code and associated regulations required the Type III supporting organizations to make such great relative donations of activity or grants to assure the attentiveness of the supported organizations.\n\nAs a consequence, supporting organizations (particularly Type III) proved attractive to high and middle-high value donors with anecdotal evidence of their widespread abuse.\n\nSupporting organizations became subject to much criticism upon two perceived abuses.\n\nOne perceived abuse related to control. Senators Baucus and Grassley argued that supporting organizations, particularly Type III, allowed donors to retain too much control over their assets.\n\nAnother perceived abuse related to liberal charitable deductions allowed to donors who contribute to supporting organizations. Since donors retained so much control, these critics believed that they should not also enjoy deductions that they would get for donating to public charities. Instead, these critics argued that such deductions should be no more favored than private organizations or even less favored because of the greater control afforded to supporting organizations compared to private foundations.\n\nThe Pension Protection Act of 2006 cracked down on supporting organizations, particularly Type III. This act applied further regulations and penalties that took away many of the privileges that supporting organizations had over private foundations. The act applies the self-dealing regulations of private foundations on supporting organizations. The act requires a payout—but leaves the exact demands of the payout, including rate and from which assets for the Treasury to determine later. The Act applied the private foundation rules of excess business holdings and the excess benefit prohibitions from the private foundation law. The act also tightened the tests for Type III supporting organizations to demonstrate that Type III supporting organizations has dependent supported organizations and that has no more than five supported organizations. The act also made collateral attacks on supporting organizations by forbidding donor-advised funds and private foundations from making qualifying distributions to Type III supporting organizations, and should they do so the distributions would become taxable subject to their respective excise taxes. Further restrictions, including explication of the payout rate contours will result from the Congress mandated survey that the IRS promulgated.\n\nIn the Pension Protection Act, Congress mandated a study on the supporting organizations to understand their role in the exempt organization world and determine what future action remained necessary. It was called the \"Study on Donor Advised Funds and Supporting Organizations.\"\n\nUnder § 509(a)(3) the Internal Revenue Code defines supporting organizations as being: \n\nIs organized, and at all times thereafter is operated, exclusively for the benefit of, to perform the functions of, or to carry out the purposes of one or more specified organizations described in paragraph 509(a)(1) or (2)\n\nThis section breaks down into two tests: the organizational test (\"is organized\") and the operational test (\"is operated\").\n\nIs (i) operated, supervised, or controlled by one or more organizations described in paragraph (1) or (2), (ii) supervised or controlled in connection with one or more such organizations, or (iii) operated in connection with one or more such organizations\n\nThis part provides three possible relationships between a supporting organization and its supported organizations. A supporting organization must fulfill the requirements of one of these three types and report it in its annual reporting to the IRS. Through either of these relationships the supported organizations provides the requisite public scrutiny over the supporting organizations. Type I resembles a parent-subsidiary relationship. Type II resembles a brother-sister relationship. These two types are the stricter of the relationships while Type III has the most relaxed standard for scrutiny by the supported organizations. In exchange for this flexibility, type III supporting organizations must pass two additional tests to ensure that the supported organizations provide public scruinty. The first test is the responsiveness test and the second test is the integral part test. The integral part test may further breakdown into two subtests, the \"but for\" subtest and the \"attentiveness\" subtest, either of which the organization may satisfy. This type III relationship, however, recently has received a crackdown by Congress and so its flexibility and relaxed standards for control and scrutiny is short-lived.\n\nIs not controlled directly or indirectly by one or more disqualified persons (as defined in 26 USCA 4946) other than foundation managers and other than one or more organizations described in paragraph 509(a)(1) or (2)\n\nThis requirement provides prophylactic protection against self-dealing, a potential abuse. Some donors try to engage in self-dealing activities in order to maintain control over their assets by controlling the supporting or supported organizations. This requirement curbs nearly every possible way a donor may exert control over the organizations and their assets.\n\nThrough the Pension Protection Act, Congress recently added (f) to § 509. Section 509(f) adds new requirements for supporting organizations.\n\nUnder § 509(f)(1), the IRC imposes new requirements on type III supporting organizations in particular. Here, they impose a stricter definitions upon their relationships with their supporting organizations: \n\nIn § 509(f)(2), the IRC concentrates on organizations controlled by donors:\n\n(3) codifies the present understanding of \"supported organization\" as a public charity supported by a supporting organization.\n\nFor an organization to qualify as a type III supporting organization, it must first prove that it constitutes a charitable trust under state law, the beneficiary is the supported trust, and the supported organization has the power to compel an accounting and enforce the trust. Then, the organization must provide further evidence to prove that it operates in connection with its supported organizations.\n\nA functionally integrated type III supporting organization (\"FISO\") performs the operations of the supported organization and remains free the excess business holding excise tax and from the payout rate that shall apply in the near future. A FISO resembles a type III supporting organization that satisfies the \"but for\" test because they both perform the operations of the supported organization, but the exact requirements for qualifying as a FISO remains unknown. Currently, the IRS has halted determinations on all requests by organizations for FISO classification until the US Treasury Department issues guidance on this matter.\n\nA disqualified person may not receive any benefit from a supporting organization otherwise the IRS may apply intermediate sanctions that tax that person 25% of the value of the benefit and tax the manager 10% of the benefit. This tax may increase further if the offenders fail to rectify the transaction and lead up to revocation of tax-exempt status.\n\nA supporting organization in combination with its disqualified persons may not own more than 20% of voting stock in a business entity not related to the furtherance of its charitable purpose. Should a supporting organization do so, then it may subject itself to the excise tax.\n\nThe Treasury Regulations for supporting organizations contain detailed explanations for the applicable tests. The regulations may change as the IRS has suspended determinations of what constitutes a functionally integrated type III supporting organization until such time that the Treasury Department may issue further guidance.\n\n\n\"US Code\"\n\n\"US public law and testimony\"\n\n\"Case law\"\n\n\"Treasury regulations\"\n\n\"Treasury notices, stances, and explanations\"\n\n\"Journal commentary\"\n\nNon Profit organization is a good organization.\n"}

It was a pivotal event in the French Revolution.\n\nThe Estates-General had been called to address the country's fiscal and agricultural crisis, but immediately after convening in May 1789, they had become bogged down in issues of representation—particularly, whether they would vote by head (which would increase the power of the Third Estate, as they outnumbered the other two estates hugely) or by order.\n\nOn 17 June, the Third Estate, led by the comte de Mirabeau, began to call themselves the National Assembly. On the morning of 20 June, the deputies were shocked to discover that the chamber door was locked and guarded by soldiers. Immediately fearing the worst and anxious that a royal attack by King Louis XVI was imminent, the deputies congregated in a nearby indoor in the of the city of Versailles, near the Palace of Versailles.\n\nThere, 576 of the 577 members from the Third Estate took a collective oath \"\". The only person who did not join was Joseph Martin-Dauch from Castelnaudary, who would only execute decisions made by the king.\n\nBefore the Revolution, French society—aside from royalty—was divided into three estates. The First Estate comprised the clergy; the Second Estate was the nobility. The entire rest of France—some 98% of the population—was the Third Estate, which ranged from very wealthy city merchants to impoverished rural farmers. The three estates met from time to time in the Estates General, a legislative assembly.\n\nAlthough the Third Estate was the overwhelming majority of the French population, the makeup of the Estates General was such that the Third Estate comprised a bare majority of the delegates. A simple majority was sufficient—as long as the delegates' votes were cast altogether. The First and Second Estates preferred to divide the vote in some way. A proposal might need to receive approval from each Estate, or there might be two \"houses\" of the Estates General (one for the first two Estates, and one for the Third), and a bill would need to be passed by both houses. Either way, the First and Second Estates could exercise veto power over proposals enjoying widespread support among the Third Estate, such as reforms that threatened the privileges of the nobility and clergy.\n\nIn France at that time, the deputies' fears, even if wrong, were reasonable and the importance of the oath goes above and beyond its context.\n\nThe oath was both a revolutionary act, and an assertion that political authority derived from the people and their representatives rather than from the monarch himself. Their solidarity forced Louis XVI to order the clergy and the nobility to join with the Third Estate in the National Assembly in order to give the illusion that he controlled the National Assembly. This oath would prove vital to the Third Estate as a step of protest that would eventually lead to more power in the Estates General, and every governing body thereafter.\n\nThe Oath signified for the first time that French citizens formally stood in opposition to Louis XVI, and the National Assembly's refusal to back down forced the king to make concessions. It was foreshadowed by, and drew considerably from, the 1776 United States Declaration of Independence, especially the preamble. The Oath also inspired a wide variety of revolutionary activity in the months afterwards, ranging from rioting across the French countryside to renewed calls for a written French constitution. Likewise, it reinforced the Assembly's strength and forced the King to formally request that voting occur based on head, not power.\nThe Tennis Court Oath (June 1789) preceded the abolition of feudalism (4 August 1789) and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen (26 August 1789).\n"}

It is a continuation of his previous book \"Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace\", which is about how computer programs can restrict freedom of ideas in cyberspace.\n\nWhile copyright helps artists get rewarded for their work, Lessig warns that a copyright regime that is too strict and grants copyright for too long a period of time (e.g. the current US legal climate) can destroy innovation, as the future always builds on the past. Lessig also discusses recent movements by corporate interests to promote longer and tighter protection of intellectual property in three layers: the code layer, the content layer, and the physical layer.\n\nThe code layer is that which is controlled by computer programs. One instance is Internet censorship in mainland China by sorting out geographical IP addresses. The content layer is notoriously illustrated by Napster, a peer-to-peer file sharing service.

{"id": "41779862", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41779862", "title": "Theranos", "text": "Theranos\n\nTheranos () was a privately held health technology corporation, initially touted as a breakthrough technology company, but subsequently infamous for its false claims to have devised blood tests that only needed very small amounts of blood. Founded in 2003 by then-19-year-old Elizabeth Holmes, Theranos raised more than US$700 million from venture capitalists and private investors, resulting in a $10 billion valuation at its peak in 2013 and 2014. Investors and the media hyped Theranos as a breakthrough in the large blood-testing market, where the US diagnostic-lab industry posts annual sales of over $70 billion. Theranos claimed its technology was revolutionary and that its tests required only about 1/100 to 1/1,000 of the amount of blood that would ordinarily be needed and cost far less than existing tests.\n\nA turning point came in October 2015, when investigative reporter John Carreyrou of \"The Wall Street Journal\" questioned the validity of Theranos' technology. Since then, the company has faced a string of legal and commercial challenges from medical authorities, investors, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), state attorneys general, former business partners, patients, and others. By June 2016, it was estimated that Holmes' personal net worth had dropped from $4.5 billion to virtually nothing. The company was near bankruptcy until it received a $100 million investment from Fortress Investment Group in 2017. By 2018, the company was again close to going bankrupt.\n\nIn July 2016, Theranos received sanctions from the CMS, including the revocation of its CLIA certificate and prohibition of Holmes and other company officials from owning or operating a lab for two years. Theranos announced it would close its laboratory operations and wellness centers to work on miniature medical testing machines. In April 2017, Theranos said it had reached a settlement agreement with CMS. Following the CMS sanctions, the Walgreens pharmacy chain terminated its contract with Theranos and filed a lawsuit claiming continuous breaches of contract. The suit was settled out of court, with Theranos compensating Walgreens for a much smaller amount than the claimed $140 million, reported at about $30 million.\n\nOn March 14, 2018, Theranos, Holmes, and former company president Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani were charged with \"massive fraud\" by the SEC. One section of the complaint says Holmes falsely claimed in 2014 that the company had annual revenues of $100 million, a thousand times more than the actual figure of $100,000. Theranos and Holmes agreed to resolve the charges against them, with Holmes paying a fine of $500,000, returning the remaining 18.9 million shares that she held, relinquishing her control of the company, and being barred from being an officer or director of any public company for ten years. According to the agreement, if Theranos were acquired or otherwise liquidated, Holmes would not profit from her ownership until more than $750 million was returned to investors and other preferred shareholders. Theranos and Holmes neither admitted nor denied the allegations in the SEC's complaint. Balwani did not settle. On June 15, 2018, the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California announced the indictment of Holmes on wire fraud and conspiracy charges. Balwani was also indicted on the same charges.\n\nTheranos ceased operations on August 31, 2018, with CEO David Taylor and a few support staff remaining on payroll for a few more days.\n\nWhile at Stanford University, Elizabeth Holmes had an idea to develop a wearable patch that could adjust the dosage of drug delivery and notify doctors of variables in patients' blood. She started developing lab-on-a-chip technology for blood tests, and had the idea for a company that would make testing cheaper, more convenient and accessible to consumers. Holmes dropped out of Stanford and used the education trust from her parents to found the company that would later be called Theranos, derived from a combination of the words \"therapy\" and \"diagnosis\". The company's original name was Real-Time Cures, which Holmes changed after deciding that too many people were dubious about the word \"cure\".\n\nIn September 2013, Theranos partnered with Walgreens to offer in-store blood tests at more than 40 locations. Walgreens announced plans to expand the \"wellness centers\" across the United States. Theranos blood tests were used on drug trial patients of GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer. Each company stated that there were no ongoing active projects with Theranos in October 2015. In November 2016, Walgreen Co. filed suit against Theranos in a federal court in Delaware, for breach of contract. Theranos reported to investors on June 21, 2017 that the suit, which originally sought $140 million in damages, was settled for less than $30 million.\n\nIn March 2015 the Cleveland Clinic announced a partnership with Theranos to test its technology in order to decrease the cost of lab tests. Theranos became the lab-work provider for Pennsylvania insurers, AmeriHealth Caritas and Capital BlueCross, in July 2015.\n\nIn July 2015, the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of the company's fingerstick blood testing device for the herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) outside a clinical laboratory setting. Theranos was awarded the 2015 Bioscience Company of the Year by AzBio.\n\nIn October 2015, John Carreyrou of the \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that Theranos was using traditional blood testing machines to run its tests instead of the company's Edison devices, and that the company's Edison machines might provide inaccurate results. Theranos claimed that the allegations were \"factually and scientifically erroneous and grounded in baseless assertions by inexperienced and disgruntled former employees and industry incumbents\". Walgreens suspended plans to expand blood-testing centers in their stores following the report. At that time, the Cleveland Clinic announced that it would work to verify Theranos technology. Theranos fought back against the \"Journal\"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> investigation, sending lawyers after sources in the story in an effort to stop them from providing information to the press.<ref name=\"BadBlood\" /? Tyler Shultz was a key source for the WSJ story. Schultz was a Theranos employee from 2013 to 14 and the grandson of one-time Theranos director George P. Shultz. Tyler Shultz had attempted to bring concerns about the company's activities to his management, and when that had failed, he had spoken to Carreyrou and also, under an alias, reported the company the New York State Department of Health.\n\nFollowing the WSJ story, the history of FDA interactions with Theranos were scrutinized. The FDA had received a formal inquiry to look at Theranos blood test devices by the U.S. Department of Defense in 2012 before the devices were commercially available and did not require FDA approval. FDA inspection reports from 2014 and 2015 stated that its containers for blood collection were \"not validated under actual or simulated use conditions\" and \"were not reviewed and not approved by designated individual(s) prior to issuance\". The FDA inspection in 2015 resulted in multiple 483's from the FDA where inspectors observed violations of FDA Title 21 Regulations After the inspection, Theranos announced that it would voluntarily suspend its tests apart from the FDA-approved herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) test.\n\nThe Arizona Department of Health Services reported issues with the company's Scottsdale lab meeting regulations in October 2015. \n\nIn January 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) sent a letter to Theranos based on an inspection of its Newark, California, lab in the Fall of 2015, reporting that the facility did not \"comply with certificate requirements and performance standards\" and caused an \"immediate jeopardy to patient health and safety\" due to a test to determine the correct dose of the blood-thinning drug warfarin. Walgreens and Capital BlueCross announced a suspension of Theranos blood tests from the Newark lab.\n\nIn March 2016, CMS regulators announced plans to enact sanctions that included suspending Holmes and Balwani from owning or operating a lab for two years and that they would revoke the lab's license. The company did not receive the sanctions until July. \n\nBy April 2016 Theranos came under criminal investigation by federal prosecutors and the SEC for allegedly misleading investors and government officials about its technology. The case is considered \"extremely unusual\" by a former assistant U.S. attorney for the Justice Department. The U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce requested information on what Theranos was doing to correct its testing inaccuracies and adherence to federal guidelines in June 2016.\n\nIn May 2016, Theranos announced that it had voided two years of results from its Edison device. The company announced that about 1 percent of test results had been voided or corrected from its proprietary machines in June 2016.\n\nIn July 2016, Theranos announced that the CMS had revoked its CLIA certificate and issued sanctions prohibiting its owners and operators from owning or operating a lab for two years, suspension of approval to receive Medicare and Medicaid payments, and a civil monetary penalty. The company discontinued testing at its Newark location while attempting to resolve the issues. Theranos announced plans to appeal the decision by regulators to revoke its license to operate a lab in California and other sanctions. \n\nIn August 2016 the company withdrew its request for emergency clearance of a Zika virus blood test after a lack of essential safeguards during the testing process was found by federal inspectors.\n\nTheranos announced that it would close its laboratory operations, wellness centers and lay off about 40 percent of its work force to work on miniature medical testing machines in October 2016. \n\nIn January 2017, Theranos announced that it had laid off 41% of its workforce, or approximately 155 people and closed the last remaining blood-testing facility after the lab failed a second major U.S. regulatory inspection. \n\nAlso that month, the company faced lawsuits from several different entities including Walgreens and the Arizona Attorney General. \n\nIn April 2017, lawyers for Partner Investments LP and two other funds, with combined stakes totaling more than $96 million in Theranos preferred shares, charged that Theranos had threatened to seek bankruptcy protection if the investors did not agree to accept additional stock equity in lieu of litigation. Theranos officials said the funds had mischaracterized the exchange offer, which was discussed before the suit was filed. The suit also alleged that Theranos Inc. had misled company directors about its practices concerning laboratory testing and that it had secretly bought lab equipment to run fake demonstrations. The case was settled on May 1, 2017. On May 1, 2017, Theranos announced that it had reached an undisclosed settlement with Partner Fund Management LP. Theranos General Counsel David Taylor stated: \"Theranos is pleased to have resolved both lawsuits with PFM. Although we are confident that we would have prevailed at trial, resolution of these two cases allows our tender offer to go forward and enables us to return our focus where it belongs, which is on executing our business plans and delivering value for our shareholders.\"\n\nAlso in April 2017, Theranos reached a settlement with CMS agreeing to stay out of the blood-testing business for at least two years in exchange for reduced penalties, and signed a consent decree with the state of Arizona over violations of the Arizona Consumer Fraud Act. Alleged violations included false advertisement and inaccurate blood testing. Theranos agreed to refund $4.65 million to the state's residents for Theranos blood testing services, regardless of whether the test results were voided or corrected.\n\nIn August 2017, Theranos announced it had reached a settlement with Walgreens. \n\nIn December 2017, Fortress Investment Group loaned $100 million to Theranos. Theranos had reportedly been on the verge of bankruptcy, with the loan meant to keep the company solvent into 2018. On April 10, 2018, the company laid off the majority of workers in a renewed bid to avoid bankruptcy. The company's total headcount was down to fewer than 25 employees, after having 800 employees at its peak.\n\nIn March 2018 the US Securities and Exchange Commission charged Theranos, its CEO Elizabeth Holmes and former president Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani, claiming they had engaged in an \"elaborate, years-long fraud\" wherein they \"deceived investors into believing that its key product – a portable blood analyzer – could conduct comprehensive blood tests from finger drops of blood.\" Holmes reached a settlement with the SEC, which requires her to pay $500,000, forfeit 19 million shares of company stock, and be barred from having a leadership position in any public company for ten years. Balwani did not settle with the SEC.\n\nOn June 15, 2018, Holmes and Balwani were indicted on multiple counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. According to the indictment, investors and doctors and patients were defrauded. It is alleged the defendants were aware of the unreliability and inaccuracy of their products, but concealed that information. If convicted, they each face a maximum fine of $250,000 and 20 years in prison. The case has been assigned to Lucy H. Koh, United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.\n\nOn September 4, 2018, Theranos announced in an email to investors that it would cease operations and release its assets and remaining cash to creditors after all efforts to find a buyer came to nothing. Most of the company's remaining employees were laid off on the previous Friday, August 31. However, CEO David Taylor and a few support staffers remained on payroll for a few more days. At the time the Theranos website was inaccessible. The Wall Street Journal reported that any equity investments in the company were made worthless by the shutdown.\n\nTheranos claimed to have developed devices to automate and miniaturize blood tests using microscopic blood volumes. Theranos dubbed its blood collection vessel the \"nanotainer\" and its analysis machine the \"Edison.\" The technology has been criticized for not being peer reviewed. Theranos claimed to have data verifying the accuracy and reliability of its tests that would be published. In February 2016, Theranos announced that it would permit the Cleveland Clinic to complete a validation study of its technology. In March, 2016, a study authored by 13 scientists appeared in the \"Journal of Clinical Investigation\", where it was stated that the company's blood test results were flagged \"outside their normal range 1.6x more often than other testing services\", that 68% of lab measurements evaluated \"showed significant interservice (sic) variability\", and that \"lipid panel test results between Theranos and other clinical services\" were \"nonequivalent\". In August 2016, the company introduced a new robotic, capillary blood testing unit named miniLab to the American Association for Clinical Chemistry, but did not present any data supporting the claimed abilities of the device.\n\nTheranos was headquartered in Palo Alto, California. It previously had laboratories in Newark, California and Scottsdale, Arizona.\n\nFrom its incorporation in 2003 until 2018, Holmes was the company's chief executive officer. She recruited Channing Robertson, a chemical-engineering professor at Stanford, to be a technical advisor and the company's first board member during its early years. Holmes' then-boyfriend Sunny Balwani, a software engineer 18 years her senior whom Holmes had met during high school, joined the company as its president and chief operating officer in 2009. In July 2011, Holmes was introduced to former Secretary of State George Shultz, who joined the Theranos board of directors that month. Over the next three years, Shultz helped to introduce almost all the outside directors on the \"all-star board,\" which included William Perry (former Secretary of Defense), Henry Kissinger (former Secretary of State), Sam Nunn (former U.S. Senator), Bill Frist (former U.S. Senator and heart-transplant surgeon), Gary Roughead (Admiral, USN, retired), James Mattis (General, USMC), Richard Kovacevich (former Wells Fargo Chairman and CEO) and Riley Bechtel (chairman of the board and former CEO at Bechtel Group). The board was criticized for consisting \"mainly of directors with diplomatic or military backgrounds.\"\n\nIn April 2016, Theranos announced its medical advisory board which included past presidents or board members of the American Association for Clinical Chemistry. Members were invited to review the company's proprietary technologies and advise on the integration into clinical practice. The board included past presidents or board members of the American Association for Clinical Chemistry such as Susan A. Evans, William Foege, former director U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), David Helfet, director of the Orthopedic Trauma Service at the Hospital for Special Surgery and professors, Ann M. Gronowski, Larry J. Kricka, Jack Ladenson, Andy O. Miller and Steven Spitalnik.\n\nBalwani left his position as President and COO in May 2016. At that time, the company announced its new board members, Fabrizio Bonanni (former executive vice president of Amgen), Richard Kovacevich and William Foege, who would help to publicly introduce its technologies.\n\nIn May 2016 members of the Theranos board of directors were:\n\nIn December 2016, it was announced the Theranos management team would be restructured with the departing of Riley Bechtel. In January 2017 incoming US Secretary of Defense nominee James Mattis resigned from the Theranos board. In January 2017 the Theranos board of directors included: Elizabeth Holmes, William Foege, Fabrizio Bonanni, and Daniel Warmenhoven, former NetApp CEO, who replaced Riley Bechtel\n\nIt was also announced in November 2016 that the celebrity-studded \"board of counselors\" would be scrapped in January 2017.\n\nTheranos raised millions of dollars in its first years. In 2004, Theranos was based in a rented basement located near the Stanford campus. By December 2004 the company had more than $6 million from investors at a valuation of $30 million. The company had about $45 million total fundraising after Series B and Series C funding in 2006. Theranos raised an additional $45 million in 2010 at a valuation of $1 billion. The company moved to the former headquarters of Facebook in June 2012. The company had significant news coverage starting in September 2013 after profiles in the \"San Francisco Business Times\" and \"Wall Street Journal\". By 2014, Theranos had raised more than $400 million with an estimated value of $9 billion. In 2016, \"Forbes\" revised the estimated net worth of the company to $800 million taking into account the $724 million of capital raised.\n\nIn May 2017, participating shareholders provided a release of any potential claims against Theranos in exchange for shares of the company's new preferred stock. Holders of more than 99 percent of the shares elected to participate. CEO Elizabeth Holmes contributed shares to the company and gave up equity to offset potential dilution to non-participating shareholders.\n\nIn May 2018 John Carreyrou reported that American business and government leaders lost more than $600 million by privately investing in Theranos. Major investments had been made by the Walton family ($150 million), Rupert Murdoch ($121 million), Betsy DeVos ($100 million), and the Cox family (of Cox Media Group) ($100 million). The final liquidation of the company in September 2018 rendered these investments completely worthless.\n\nJohn Carreyrou, the \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter whose work exposed Theranos, published a book-length treatment in May 2018 titled \"\". As of June 2016 a film version was in the works starring Jennifer Lawrence as Elizabeth Holmes, written by Vanessa Taylor and directed by Adam McKay.\n\nAlex Gibney created a film titled “” that will make its official debut at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah in 2019.\n\n\n"}

EU member states are entitled to have additional regulatory requirements for the benefit of investors.\n\nThe objective of the original UCITS Directive 85/611/EEC, adopted in 1985, was to allow for open-ended funds investing in transferable securities to be subject to the same regulation in every Member State. It was hoped that once such legislative uniformity was established throughout Europe, funds authorised in one Member State could be sold to the public in each Member State without further authorisation, thereby furthering the EU's goal of a single market for financial services in Europe.\n\nThe reality differed somewhat from the expectation due primarily to individual marketing rules in each Member State that created obstacles to cross-border marketing of UCITS. In addition, the limited definition of permitted investments for UCITS weakened the marketing possibilities of a UCITS. Accordingly, in the early 1990s proposals were developed to amend the 1985 Directive and more successfully harmonise laws throughout Europe. These discussions, although leading to a draft UCITS II directive, were subsequently abandoned as being too ambitious when the Council of Ministers could not reach a common position.\n\nIn July 1998 the EU Commission published a new proposal which was drafted in two parts (a product proposal and a service provider proposal), which sought to amend the 1985 Directive. These proposals were finally adopted in December 2001, and are known as \"UCITS III\", which are now in force. LuxAlpha, an alleged \"feeder fund\" to Bernard Madoff's firm, was a UCITS-regulated fund.\n\nThe Management Directive 2001/107/EC, seeks to give management companies a \"European passport\" to operate throughout the EU, and widens the activities which they are allowed to undertake. It also introduces the concept of a simplified prospectus, which is intended to provide more accessible and comprehensive information in a simplified format to assist the cross-border marketing of UCITS throughout Europe.\n\nThe primary aim of the Product Directive 2001/108/EC is to remove barriers to the cross-border marketing of units of collective investment funds by allowing funds to invest in a wider range of financial instruments (including derivatives), which subject the same regulation in every Member state. All UCITS funds must comply with the same investment limits.\n\nA collective investment fund may apply for UCITS status in order to allow EU-wide marketing. The concept is to create a single funds market across the EU. The aim is that with a larger market the economies of scale will reduce costs for investment managers which can be passed on to consumers.\n\nThroughout Europe approximately €6.8 trillion are invested in collective investments. Of these funds about 76% are UCITS.\n\nThe proposal of UCITS IV Directive was approved by the European Parliament on 13 January 2009 and also by the Council of the European Union as the Directive 2009/65/EC, to be implemented on 1 July 2011. This updated the UCITS III Directives by introducing the following changes,\n\n\nOn 23 July 2014 the European Union adopted directive 2014/91/EU (\"UCITS V\") on the co-ordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities as regards depositary functions, remuneration policies and sanctions. \n\nUCITS V can be compared with the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (\"AIFMD\") (European Union Directive 2011/61/EU), which is a parallel regulation for hedge funds and alternative investments.\n\nUCITS V introduces new rules on UCITS depositaries, such as the entities eligible to assume this role, their tasks, delegation arrangements and the depositaries’ liability as well as general remuneration principles that apply to fund managers. \n\nThe depositary as a specific function under UCITS legislation (rather as it does under AIFMD). The depositary may delegate its safekeeping functions (but not other depositary functions to a third party custodian.\n\nUCITS V directive requires a Key Investor Information Document or KIID is produced for investors – see example (autokiid.com)\n\nLuxembourg transposed the UCITS V directive with the law of 10 May 2016 applied since 1 June 2016. This law of 10 May 2016 amended the Luxembourg law of 17 December 2010 on undertakings for collective investment, as amended (the \"2010 Law\"), in particular, Parts I, IV and V of the 2010 Law.\n\nThe proposals concern areas other than those addressed by UCITS V. In summary, these are the topics raised:\n1. eligible assets and the use of derivatives – whether it is necessary to limit the scope of eligible derivatives of those traded on multilateral platforms and cleared by a central counterparty;\n2. efficient portfolio management techniques – whether the current criteria (on eligibility, liquidity and diversification for example) requires amendment;\n3. over-the-counter derivatives ('OTC') – how OTC derivative transactions should be dealt with when assessing UCITS limits on counterparty \n4. extraordinary liquidity management rules – whether there is a need for a common framework for dealing with liquidity bottlenecks in exceptional cases or otherwise;\n5. depositary passport – whether a depositary passport should be introduced and how this would work in practice;\n6. money market funds1 – whether they present a source of systemic risk and/or do they need harmonised regulation at EU level;\n7. long-term investments – (a) how access can be afforded to retail investors and how this could be implemented and regulated; (b) what proportion of a fund's portfolio should be dedicated to such assets; and (c) whether\ndiversification rules are necessary to secure adequate liquidity;\n8. improvements to the UCITS IV framework – for example Article 64(1) of the UCITS Directive requires UCITS to provide information to investors in the following two cases: (i) where an ordinary UCITS converts into a feeder\nUCITS; and (ii) where a master UCITS changes. As it stands, this does not cover a third possible scenario, namely where a feeder UCITS converts into an ordinary UCITS. Such conversions may lead to a significant\nchange in the investment strategy.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "35062788", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35062788", "title": "Yahoo! litigation", "text": "Yahoo! litigation\n\nYahoo! has been a party to several instances of litigation.\n\nIn May 1999, GoTo.com filed a patent application titled \"System and method for influencing a position on a search result list generated by a computer network search engine\". The patent was granted as in July 2001. A related patent has also been granted in Australia and other patent applications remain pending.\n\nPrior to its acquisition by Yahoo!, Overture initiated infringement proceedings under this patent against FindWhat.com in January 2002 and Google in April 2002.\n\nThe lawsuit against Google related to its AdWords service. In February 2002, Google introduced a service called AdWords Select that allowed marketers to bid for higher placement in marked sections - a tactic that had some similarities to Overture's search-listing auctions.\n\nFollowing Yahoo!'s acquisition of Overture, the lawsuit was settled with Google agreeing to issue 2.7 million shares of common stock to Yahoo! in exchange for a perpetual license.\n\nYahoo filed a suit against Facebook on March 12, 2012, claiming Facebook had infringed on ten of Yahoo's patents\n\nIn 1999, a complaint was instituted against GeoCities stating that the corporation violated the provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act under 14 USC §45, which states in relevant part, \"Unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, are hereby declared unlawful.\" The FTC found that GeoCities was engaged in deceptive acts and practices in contravention to their stated privacy act. Subsequently, a consent order was entered into which prohibits GeoCities from misrepresenting the purpose for which it collects and/or uses personal identifying information from consumers. A copy of the complaint and order can be found at 127 F.T.C. 94 (page 94).\n\nThe litigation came about in this way: GeoCities provided free home pages and e-mail address to children and adults who provided personally identifying and demographic information when they registered for the website. At the time of the complaint, GeoCities had more than 1.8 million members who were \"homesteaders.\" GeoCities illegally permitted third-party advertisers to promote products targeted to GeoCities' 1.8 million users, by using personally identifiable information obtained in the registration process. These acts and practices affected \"commerce\" as defined in Section 4 of the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nThe problem GeoCities faced was that it placed a privacy statement on its New Member Application Form and on its website promising that it would never give personally identifying information to anyone without the user's permission. GeoCities sold personal information to third parties who used the information for purposes other than those for which members gave permission.\n\nIt was ordered that GeoCities would not make any misrepresentation, in any manner about its collection or use of personal identifying information, including what information will be disclosed to third parties. GeoCities was not allowed to collect personal identifying information from any child if GeoCities had actual knowledge that the child did not have his parents' permission to provide the information.\n\nOn April 18, 2007, Wang Xiaoning's wife Yu Ling sued Yahoo! under human rights laws, specifically the Alien Torts Statute (28 U.S.C. § 1350) and Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991 (TVPA), 106 Stat. 73 (1992) in federal court in San Francisco, California, United States. Wang was named as a plaintiff in the Yahoo suit, as was Shi Tao, a Chinese journalist detained and convicted for emailing a description of Chinese’s government’s instructions to journalists for the upcoming anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre. Both men were punished for exercising their freedom of speech because Yahoo!’s Chinese subsidiary provided their identifying information to the Chinese government.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed by the World Organization for Human Rights USA. \"Yahoo is guilty of 'an act of corporate irresponsibility,' said Morton Sklar, then the Executive Director of the group. 'Yahoo had reason to know that if they provided China with identification information that those individuals would be arrested.\"\n\nIn 2006, Yahoo! executives had testified before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs that the company was unaware of the nature of the charges against Shi Tao when it gave his personal information to the Chinese government. However, in the course of the litigation, new evidence came to light that Yahoo! knew what the charges against Shi Tao were and disclosed his identity anyway.\n\nIn November 2007, Yahoo! was called back to Congress to testify about its actions in China before the bi-partisan House Committee on Foreign Affairs. The plaintiffs’ families traveled from China to bear witness as the Committee questioned Yahoo!’s executives. Referencing the discrepancy between Yahoo!’s leaders’ testimony in 2006 and the new evidence, the Committee Chair, Representative Tom Lantos, said Yahoo!’s failure to correct the record was inexcusably negligent behavior at best and deliberately deceptive behavior at worst.\n\nRep. Lantos then told CEO Jerry Yang and General Counsel Michael Callahan to beg forgiveness from the families of the detainees. Both men turned and bowed to the women, and publicly apologized. One week later, Yahoo! and the family settled the lawsuit.\n\nShi Tao and Wang Xiaoning remain in prison.\n\nPincus v. Yahoo! Inc., 13-cv-05326, was a lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California in San Jose, California. Brian Pincus was seeking a class-action suit to represent non-Yahoo customers whose email address was intercepted by Yahoo! who allegedly targets ads to increase its revenue.\n"}
