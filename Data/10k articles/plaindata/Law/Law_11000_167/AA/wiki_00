By law, the purpose of the media campaign was to prevent drug abuse among teens in the United States; increase awareness of adults of the impact of drug abuse on young people; and encourage parents and other interested adults to discuss with young people the dangers of illegal drug use.\n\nThe goal of this campaign was to help teens stand up to negative pressures, and influences. The more aware one becomes about the influences around them, the more prepared they will be to face them, including the pressure to use drugs and alcohol. \n\n\"Above the Influence\" is symbolized by its campaign logo featuring an arrow pointing up with a circle around it.\n\nAs of March 2014, federal funding and oversight of Above the Influence ceased, and it transitioned to become a program of the not-for-profit Partnership for Drug-Free Kids.\n\nIn 2006, the Government Accountability Office released the results of 5-year-study, concluding that the previous, “My Anti-Drug”, campaign was ineffective, and likely counterproductive, leading those exposed to an increased perception that others use marijuana, stating, \"analysis also indicated that among current, non-drug-using youth, exposure to the campaign had unfavorable effects on their anti-drug norms and perceptions of other youths’ use of marijuana — that is, greater exposure to the campaign was associated with weaker anti-drug norms and increases in the perceptions that others use marijuana.\"\n\nIn 2011, Ohio State University released the results of an independent scientific study stating that the \"Above the Influence\" campaign appears to have effectively reduced marijuana use by teenagers. \n\"Evidence for the success of \"Above the Influence\" is especially heartening because the primary independent evaluation of its predecessor campaign, 'My Anti-Drug', showed no evidence for success\", said Michael Slater, principal investigator of the new study and professor of communication at Ohio State University.\n“The ‘Above the Influence’ campaign appears to be successful because it taps into the desire by teenagers to be independent and self-sufficient,” Slater said. He also mentioned the limitations of the study. These include the fact that findings regarding the ONDCP campaign were based on survey results and not a randomized, experimental design in which some youth saw the ONDCP campaign and others did not. Another limitation was that the study, while taking place in 20 communities around the U.S., did not use a random sample of U.S. youth.\n\n"}

A repudiation of a contract by one party (the repudiating party) will entitle the other party (the aggrieved party) to elect to terminate the contract. This is based on objective intentions i.e. the repudiating party's words or conduct.; This unwillingness or inability to perform a condition must deprive the aggrieved party of substantially the whole of the benefit that they would have received if the remaining obligations were performed under the contract. When such an event occurs, the performing party to the contract is excused from having to fulfill his or her obligations. However, the repudiation can be retracted by the promising party so long as there has been no material change in the position of the performing party in the interim. A retraction of the repudiation restores the performer's obligation to perform on the contract.\n\nAnother rationale for the doctrine of repudiation is based on the breach of an implied term not rendering future performance futile: \"[O]ne essential promise which is implied in every contract is that neither party will without just cause repudiate his obligations under the contract, whether the time for performance has arrived or not.\"\n\nRepudiation of the contract by one party entitles the other party the right to terminate and claim for damages. However, it is possible that the repudiating party does not repudiate the entire contract but only certain obligations. In this case, the aggrieved party will only acquire the right to terminate if the repudiating party repudiates an obligation which, if breached, would grant a right to terminate.\n\nIf the promising party's repudiation makes it impossible to fulfil its promise, then retraction is not possible and no act by the promising party can restore the performing party's obligations under the contract. For example, if A promises to give B a unique sculpture in exchange for B painting A's house, but A then sells the sculpture to C before B begins the job, this act by A constitutes an anticipatory repudiation which excuses B from performing. Once the sculpture has left A's possession, there is no way that A can fulfil the promise to give the sculpture to B.\n\nThe question arises as to why any party would want to provide notice of anticipatory breach. The reason is that once the performing party is informed of the anticipatory breach, a duty is then created for the performing party to mitigate damages as a result of the breach. Another situation where anticipatory repudiation can occur is where a party has reason to believe the other party is not going to perform and requests reasonable assurances that the other party will perform (see UCC 2-609(1)). If such reasonable assurances are not given, it will constitute anticipatory repudiation, for which the performing party has various remedies, including termination. However, anticipatory repudiation only applies to a bilateral executory contract with non-performed duties on both sides. Additionally, the repudiation must be unequivocal.\n\nAccording to UCC 2-713(1) damages are to be measured at the time when the buyer learned of the breach. This is easy with a one transaction sale, e.g. a widget at the purchaser's door step on X date,; but when does the purchaser learn of the breach in an anticipatory repudiation? There are three main views:\n\n\n"}

It served a largely advisory role, with most powers over the Territory still lying in the hands of the relevant federal minister through the life of the Assembly.\n\nThree years after the seat of government was established at Canberra and after the opening of the first Parliament House in 1927, an appointed Advisory Council was established to administer the capital. In 1974 this was replaced by a fully elected Legislative Assembly, advising the Department of the Capital Territory. In 1979 this became a House of Assembly of 18 elected members, which was dissolved in 1986. In 1978 a referendum on self-government was defeated, with 68 per cent of voters recording a No vote. The federal Labor government of Prime Minister Bob Hawke set up a Self-Government Task Force in 1986 to report on the government of the ACT.\n\nThe assembly was first created in 1975 by the Whitlam government, as a response to frequent criticism about the lack of representation for the citizens of the territory. Whitlam had appointed the local federal MP, Kep Enderby, as Minister for the ACT, and Enderby sought to create a new representative body along the lines of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, which had been created in 1974. Elections were held for the first Legislative Assembly that year, with representatives of the Labor Party, Liberal Party, Australia Party, and several independents taking seats in the Assembly. Unlike its Northern Territory counterpart, it was not made self-governing in 1977.\n\nThe new Assembly began sitting in the then-Civic Offices, later renovated to become the current Legislative Assembly Building. An independent MLA, Jim Pead, took office as the first President (the equivalent of the Speaker) of the new body. Gordon Walsh became the first leader of the Labor caucus, with Dr Peter Hughes leading the Liberal caucus. Both were replaced in 1977; Walsh joined the nascent Australian Democrats, and was replaced as leader by Peter Vallee, Hughes quit the Liberal Party and was replaced as leader by Jim Leedman. Ivor Vivian became the leader of the Australia Party, before being replaced by Walsh in 1977. The first Assembly saw two prominent members on its benches: future federal ministers Ros Kelly and Susan Ryan. Ryan resigned during the first term, successfully seeking a seat in the Senate.\n\nThe second election for the Assembly was held in 1979, and saw a change in name from the Legislative Assembly to the House of Assembly. The election saw the addition of a fourth party, with the conservative Family Team led by Bev Cains winning a seat. It also saw the election of future self-government ministers Greg Cornwell and Paul Whalan. A third election was held in 1982, which saw the introduction of a more partisan system. The Liberals held a majority in the Assembly, with Leedman becoming Leader of the House, and new Labor leader Ken Doyle becoming the minority leader. He was to be short-lived as leader, with Maurene Horder succeeding him after only two years.\n\nThe last Assembly also saw the creation of an office of Speaker, filled by independent MHA Harold Hird. The final election also saw the election of future Liberal Chief Minister Trevor Kaine. It was allowed to expire in 1986 due to plans to introduce full self-government for the territory. After some years of discussions, the House of Assembly was replaced with the current Legislative Assembly in 1989, with new Labor leader Rosemary Follett becoming the first Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory.\n\nVoting was not compulsory for the House of Assembly, and its influence was limited. Many of its prominent figures retired rather than contest the elections for the new Legislative Assembly in 1989; several others, including outgoing Speaker Harold Hird and Family Team leader Bev Cains were soundly defeated. Three MHAs, however—Greg Cornwell, Trevor Kaine, and Paul Whalan—went on to be elected to the new parliament, and later served in major roles.\n\nDivision of Canberra (Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly)\n\nDivision of Fraser (Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly)\n\n"}

The plant was to be supplied with lithium manganese electrode from NEC TOKIN's factory in Sagamihara, Kanagawa; itself upgraded at a cost of ¥11 billion ($128million). Initial markets were to be forklift trucks, followed by electric and hybrid vehicles manufactured by Nissan.\n\nInitial production was based on a manganese spinel cathode, with batteries formed from laminated cells.

Quon, 560 U.S. 746 (2010), is a United States Supreme Court case concerning the extent to which the right to privacy applies to electronic communications in a government workplace. It was an appeal by the city of Ontario, California, from a Ninth Circuit decision holding that it had violated the Fourth Amendment rights of two of its police officers when it disciplined them following an audit of pager text messages that discovered many of those messages were personal in nature, some sexually explicit. The Court unanimously held that the audit was work-related and thus did not violate the Fourth Amendment's protections against unreasonable search and seizure.\n\nOntario police sergeant Jeff Quon, along with other officers and those they were exchanging messages with, had sued the city, their superiors and the pager service provider in federal court. They had alleged a violation of not only their constitutional rights but federal telecommunications privacy laws. Their defense was that a superior officer had promised the pager messages themselves would not be audited if the officers reimbursed the city for fees it incurred when they exceeded a monthly character limit.\n\nJustice Anthony Kennedy wrote the majority opinion signed by seven of his fellow justices. It decided the case purely on the reasonableness of the pager audit, explicitly refusing to consider \"far-reaching issues\" it raised on the grounds that modern communications technology and its role in society was still evolving. He nevertheless discussed those issues at some length in explaining why the Court chose not to rule on them, in addition to responding, for argument's sake, more directly to issues raised by the respondents. John Paul Stevens wrote a separate concurring opinion, as did Antonin Scalia, who would have used a different test he had proposed in an earlier case to reach the same result.\n\nOutside commentators mostly praised the justices for this display of restraint, but Scalia criticized it harshly in his concurrence, calling it vague. He considered his fellow justices in \"disregard of duty\" for their refusal to address the Fourth Amendment issues. A month after the court handed down its decision, an appellate court in Georgia similarly criticized it for \"a marked lack of clarity\" as it narrowed an earlier ruling to remove a finding that there was no expectation of privacy in the contents of email. An article in \"The New York Times\" later summarized this criticism, and its \"faux unanimity\", as emblematic of what some judges and lawyers have found an increasingly frustrating trend in Roberts Court opinions.\n\nIn 2001 the Ontario Police Department (OPD) acquired 20 alphanumeric pagers to distribute to officers in its SWAT unit so they could better coordinate their activities. The contract between the department and Arch Wireless, now USA Mobility, was for usage up to a fixed limit of 25,000 characters per month, above which an overage fee would be charged. Pager use was covered by the OPD's computer and Internet use policy, under which employees agreed that \"the city reserves the right to monitor and log all network activity including e-mail and Internet use, with or without notice\". The policy did not specifically mention text messages, but employees were told both verbally, at a staff meeting and through a memorandum that they were included and that only \"light personal communications\" were allowed during work hours. It also stated that \"inappropriate, derogatory, obscene, suggestive, defamatory, or harassing language in the e-mail system will not be tolerated\".\nSeveral officers, including Sgt. Jeff Quon, a 20-year veteran of the department, exceeded the limit during the first two billing cycles. He was allowed to reimburse the city for the fee. Lt. James Duke, head of the department's Administrative Bureau, told him that his communications would not be monitored if he paid the overage, but that he should stop using the pager so much. When Quon and another officer continued to exceed the limit and reimburse the city, Duke told then-Chief Lloyd Scharf he was \"tired of being a bill collector\". The OPD began to consider whether the character limit it had contracted for was too low and it was forcing officers to pay for work-related communications, as had sometimes happened in the past.\n\nAt Scharf's direction, Duke requested from Arch transcripts of text messages sent by Quon and the other officer. After verifying that the city was the subscriber on the account, an Arch employee sent Duke the transcripts. Many messages were personal and some were sexually explicit, sent by the married Quon to his girlfriend at work. In one month as few as 8% of Quon's texts had been work-related. A transcript from which messages sent when Quon and the other officer were off-duty had been redacted was sent to the OPD's internal affairs sergeant, and after an investigation Quon and the other officer were allegedly disciplined.\n\nThe case would involve two areas of law, both coming under the Fourth Amendment. The first was the privacy rights Quon and the other officers had over text messages sent on equipment paid for by their employers. The other was their rights as public employees, since their superiors were also agents of the state.\n\nCongress had passed the Electronic Communications Privacy Act in 1986, which addressed issues raised as more and more companies stored records with highly personal data about individual consumers in off-site databases operated by third parties. A key section, known as the Stored Communications Act (SCA), distinguished between electronic communications services which actively transmitted and received data and remote communications services whose only role was to archive and backup transmitted data for at least some period of time. The former could release transmitted data only to its sender or recipient; the latter could also release that information to the subscriber regardless of who had sent or received it.\n\nThe following year, 1987, the Supreme Court had first dealt with the Fourth Amendment rights of government employees under administrative investigation in \"O'Connor v. Ortega\", a case arising from the search of a supervising physician's office and records at a California public hospital. By a 5-4 margin the court had ruled that while public employees had Fourth Amendment protections, the search was reasonable and constitutional and that other such warrantless searches of public employees' belongings or workspace, where applicable, were similarly permissible as long as they were reasonably work-related in inception and scope.\nThe justices in that majority differed on what standards to use for evaluating the reasonableness of a search of a public employees' personal space and belongings. Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for a four-justice plurality declaring that government employees did not lose their Fourth Amendment rights at work. In the latter instance, since the working environments of public employees can be drastically different, leading to some where no reasonable expectation of privacy could be argued to exist, lower courts should consider the \"operational realities\" of the work environment when determining if a public employee's rights against unreasonable search and seizure were violated. Following the principle laid out in \"Connick v. Myers\", an earlier decision concerning the constitutional rights of public employees, that \"government offices could not function if every employment decision became a constitutional matter\", the majority distinguished between searches \"merely incident to the primary business of the agency,\" such as the retrieval of a document or tool from a desk or locker and thus not requiring a warrant at all, from those conducted to investigate a possible violation of workplace rules and procedures.\n\nIn a concurring opinion, Antonin Scalia rejected the plurality analysis, saying instead that \"government searches to retrieve work-related materials or to investigate violations of workplace rules — searches of the sort that are regarded as reasonable and normal in the private employer context — do not violate the Fourth Amendment\".\n\nSince Scalia's opinion had provided the case's deciding vote, either it or the plurality could be used by lower courts until another such case were to come to the court and force a resolution of the question. The court would consider the Fourth Amendment rights of public employees again two years later, in 1989's \"Treasury Employees v. Von Raab\". In that case another divided court upheld the Customs Service's requirement that applicants for positions that involved carrying a firearm and the possibility of drug interdiction undergo drug tests by urinalysis.\n\nThe case began in federal court. After a district court found in favor of the defendants, a three-judge appellate panel reversed the decision. The circuit court denied a petition for an \"en banc\" rehearing; a simultaneous \"certiorari\" petition to the Supreme Court was granted.\n\nA major issue at all levels was whether the department's written Internet policy, or Duke's practice of just collecting the overage fee, was the operating reality of the OPD workplace. If it was the former, Quon had no reasonable expectation of privacy for his pager messages. The city and department argued that Duke could not set or amend policy so what he said was irrelevant. And even if it was, it did not matter since the pager messages could be disclosed under the California Public Records Act. The plaintiffs argued that since Duke was the officer in charge of the contract with Arch, and the policy change that covered the pagers was never communicated in any definitive way, his assurance that he would not read Quon's messages if he reimbursed the city was all that mattered.\n\nFor Quon's co-plaintiffs, there was what one commentator later called \"the really tricky question in the case\", their claim that the city violated their privacy in the course of investigating Quon. Two of the other plaintiffs were OPD employees who had not had pager overuse problems, and the third, his estranged wife, had left the OPD's employment and was using her own pager. The city argued that they should have been aware Quon had no expectation of privacy and that thus their exchanges with him would not be protected, either.\n\nIn 2003 Quon, his ex-wife, girlfriend and another officer, Steve Trujillo, sued the city, the department, the police chief and Arch in Central California U.S. district court, Eastern Division, in Riverside. Judge Stephen G. Larson heard their claims of SCA violation, invasion of privacy and their constitutional protections against unreasonable search and seizure. Arch was granted summary judgment in its favor on the SCA claim since it was found to be a remote computing service, not subject to the statute's provisions.\n\nThe court ruled that Quon and his fellow plaintiffs had a reasonable expectation of privacy. It ordered a jury trial to determine whether the purpose of the audit was, as the department maintained, to find out whether it needed higher character limits or, as Quon claimed, to expose the personal nature of the texts. When the jury found in favor of the OPD, judgment was entered in favor of the defendants.\n\nOn appeal in 2008, a panel of two Ninth Circuit judges, Kim McLane Wardlaw and Harry Pregerson, along with Western Washington district judge Ronald B. Leighton. Wardlaw, writing for all three, noted that \"[t]he recently minted standard of electronic communication via e-mails, text messages, and other means opens a new frontier in Fourth Amendment jurisprudence that has been little explored\". They agreed with the district court that Quon and his co-appellees had a reasonable expectation of privacy due to the assurances from Duke.\n\nBut they reversed since they found the search unreasonable as a matter of law. \"The OPD surreptitiously reviewed messages that all parties reasonably believed were free from third-party review\", Wardlaw wrote. The OPD could have obtained the information it sought in a number of less intrusive ways without viewing the content of the messages, such as warning Quon ahead of time or asking him to redact personal messages from an unreviewed transcript, she observed.\n\nThe ruling was applauded by online privacy advocates. The Electronic Frontier Foundation called it a \"tremendous victory...the Fourth Amendment applies to your communications online just as strongly as it does to your letters and packages\". \"Ars Technica\" said it \"provide[d] an extensive space for workspace privacy\". George Washington University law professor Orin Kerr, a Fourth Amendment scholar who was cited in the opinion, called it \"a noteworthy holding that I think is correct and very important\" at the \"Volokh Conspiracy\" blawg.\nIt also overturned the summary judgment granted to Arch on the SCA claim, finding the company to be an electronic communications service and thus subject to stricter privacy requirements. The police chief was granted qualified immunity due to the lack of clearly established law in the area, while the city and department were denied their claim to statutory immunity. The SCA claims were remanded to district court.\n\nThe appellees petitioned for an \"en banc\" rehearing and were denied early in 2009. Six justices on the circuit dissented. Sandra Segal Ikuta, writing for them, criticized her colleague for two errors. Ikuta insisted the department's policy, and California's Public Records Act, mooted any discretionary interpretation of the policy that Duke may have conveyed to Quon, thus denying him a reasonable expectation of privacy. She also reminded Wardlaw that the Supreme Court had several times rejected the test on which she read Wardlaw's opinion relying on, that governments must use the least intrusive method of obtaining information available in order to protect employees' Fourth Amendment rights, a rule followed by seven other circuits as well.\n\nJudge Wardlaw wrote a rare concurrence with the order, criticzing the dissent for ignoring the facts of the case. \"[N]o poet ever interpreted nature as freely as Judge Ikuta interprets the record on this appeal\", she said. As a matter of law, it was the dissenters, not her, who had ignored \"O'Connor\": \"By stripping public employees of all rights to privacy regardless of the actual operational realities of each workplace, the dissent would have us create a far broader rule than Supreme Court precedent allows. The majority of our court properly rejected the dissenting judge's efforts to do so.\"\n\nConcurrent with the \"en banc\" petition, the appellees filed a \"certiorari\" petition to the Supreme Court, requesting it hear the case. They reiterated many of Ikuta's points, particularly her criticism of the panel's apparent adoption of the rejected least-intrusive-means test, and said it would be an \"excellent vehicle\" for revisiting \"O'Connor\" in light of new technology that complicated the workplace privacy issue. A month later the California State Association of Counties and the League of California Cities filed an \"amicus curiae\" brief in support of the petition making the same arguments, but in particular saying the opinion mischaracterized the operational realities of the case.\n\nIn opposition, Quon and the other respondents argued, as Wardlaw's concurrence had, that Ikuta and petitioners had greatly exaggerated the role that the less-intrusive-means test had played in the panel opinion, and that the facts of the case did not present any constitutional issues. In a reply brief, the petitioners noted that other commentators on the case agreed that it had mistakenly applied the less-intrusive-means test.\n\nLate that year, the Supreme Court granted \"certiorari\" to the city, OPD and Chief Scharf, making the case into \"Ontario v. Quon\". Kerr found this \"an odd grant\", since he had not expected the Supreme Court to find any issues making the case worth hearing. He suspected the justices were responding to a common issue with cases from the Ninth Circuit, where the minority of judges with politically conservative leanings had reacted vigorously to a perceived excess on the part of the circuit's dominant liberals. Oral arguments were scheduled for April, with a decision expected in June.\n\nThe decision to hear \"Quon\" attracted attention from several quarters. It would be the first case touching on the workplace privacy rights of public employees since \"Von Raab\", and raised the possibility that the Court would resolve the \"O'Connor\" conflict between Scalia's private-workplace standard and the plurality's \"operational realities\" consideration. It had not been an issue in the case, but Scalia was the only justice from that majority still on the court. New justice Sonia Sotomayor was expected to favor the city's side, since she had ruled for New York State's right to search an employee's computer in a similar case as a judge on the Second Circuit.\n\nElectronic privacy advocates agreed with Wardlaw that the case was a \"new frontier\" for Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, since personal communications technology had advanced considerably since 1987, intertwining personal and work lives much more closely. It was expected that the court's ruling, though it would only directly affect government workplaces, would affect the private workplace as well.\n\nKerr told \"The New York Times\" that despite the novelty of the issue, he expected the resulting decision to be narrow due to the unusual circumstances from which the case arose. Elsewhere, he said the Court would be better off avoiding the question of whether the department violated the privacy of the people Quon was texting due to the lack of clear precedent for such a ruling with older technologies and the minimal treatment of the issue in the lower-court opinions.\n\nThe parties' briefs reiterated their earlier arguments. \"The City and Department should not be punished because a legitimate workplace search happened to turn up sexually explicit messages that plaintiffs need not and should not have sent on government-issued equipment in the first place\", the city stated. The respondents urged the Court to use the case to adopt the \"O'Connor\" plurality's \"operational realities\" standard, and set forth a more extensive response to the pettioners' claim that the text messages' status as public records was fatal to any reasonable expectation of privacy by any correspondent.\n\n\"Amici\" briefs were filed by several interested organizations for both sides. The city was joined by the federal government, represented by the Solicitor General's office, the National League of Cities and other organizations representing municipal and county governments and school-governance organizations led by the National School Boards Association. All believed their ability to function effectively as government bodies would be impeded if the Ninth Circuit was upheld. The \"Los Angeles Times\" and other media organizations also urged reversal on the grounds that the public interest was served by as broad a definition of public records as possible, particularly where police operations were concerned.\n\nWeighing in on Quon's side was the AFL-CIO, on behalf of those members of its constituent labor unions who were public employees. The New York Intellectual Property Law Association (NYIPLA), whose members litigate privacy claims, called on the Court to refrain from setting down any clear rules as technology, and social expectations of privacy related to it, were still evolving. The Electronic Privacy Information Center's brief, signed by technical experts as well as lawyers, focused on the importance of data minimization to both security and privacy protection. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), American Civil Liberties Union, Center for Democracy and Technology and Public Citizen filed a joint brief.<ref name=\"EFF/ACLU/CDT/PC amicus\"></ref> The conservative Rutherford Institute filed a motion requesting leave to file their \"amicus\" in favor of respondents since one withheld permission.\n\nOral arguments were heard on April 19, 2010. Kent Richland, the city's lawyer, who had previously argued before the justices on behalf of Anna Nicole Smith in \"Marshall v. Marshall\", and Deputy Solicitor General Neal Katyal argued for petitioners; Dieter Dammeier, a former police officer himself, argued for Quon and the respondents.\n\nCommentators, looking for signs as to how the Court would rule, felt the justices' questions suggested a narrow focus on the issue of whether the search was reasonable. Chief Justice John Roberts surprised some with his apparent strong sympathy for Quon's claims. Orin Kerr noted the many questions asked about how the pagers and other technologies work, and how that lack of familiarity reinforced, in his view, the need for caution, quoting from one of his own papers: \"Judges who attempt to use the Fourth Amendment to craft broad regulatory rules covering new technologies run an unusually high risk of crafting rules based on incorrect assumptions of context and technological practice\".\n\nDuring Richland's argument, the justices inquired closely about the city's contention that Quon had no reasonable expectation of privacy over his text messages. Justice Sotomayor asked Richland about a hypothetical scenario in which a sergeant knew that various officers engaged in sexually explicit texting with romantic partners and decided to look at the transcripts out of sheer salacity. \"Does that officer have any expectation of privacy that his boss won't just listen in out of prurient interest?\" Richland answered that the motive of the examiner should not affect a privacy expectation. \"[W]hen the filthy-minded police chief listens in, it's a very bad thing, but it's not—it's not offending your right of privacy,\" concluded Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked how the OPD could have examined the transcripts lawfully if the SCA forbade their release. Richland replied that the statute was complex and highly technical, and cited the Court's 1980 \"United States v. Payner\" to the effect that \"a complicated law ... simply cannot be the basis for a reasonable expectation of privacy\". He then turned over the rest of his time to Katyal.\n\nDuring the Deputy Solicitor General's argument, another recent appointee, Justice Samuel Alito talked about the uncertainties of modern communications technology. \"There isn't a well-established understanding about what is private and what isn't private. It's a little different from putting garbage out in front of your house, which has happened for a long time\". After Katyal agreed that these things were \"in flux\" and thus the Court should avoid making any broadly applicable rules on the first hearing, Chief Justice John Roberts speculated that that principle cut both ways and that perhaps the Court should at least say the Constitution applied in this case and make rules later.\n\nWhen Dammeier argued for the respondents, Ginsburg and Breyer pressed him on why it was unreasonable for the department to review the content of the messages if it wanted to find out if it needed a higher character limit. The lawyer reiterated the jury's finding and said \"they didn't need to do that\". In response to further questioning from Breyer, he restated the other ways Judge Wardlaw had suggested the department could have obtained the information without reviewing the messages themselves. Justice Sotomayor was skeptical. \"You're relying on the very person you're auditing to do the audit for you. That doesn't seem either practical or business-wise.\"\n\nJustice John Paul Stevens brought up the issue of public review. His colleague Anthony Kennedy noted that attorneys challenging probable cause for a police raid would probably request the pager messages among other things, which Quon would certainly have been aware of, affecting his expectation of privacy. Dammeier responded that any mail he or anyone else sends would certainly be discoverable in litigation, but that possibility did not materially affect his expectation of privacy over it. He further reminded Scalia that in \"O'Connor\" the Court had found a reasonable expectation of privacy over the contents of a public employee's desk. Stevens pointed out that it was more likely that law enforcement communications would be reviewed by third parties than documents in doctors' desks. \"I don't think we're taking away the government's ability to do searches under proper circumstances,\" Dammeier told him.\n\nDammeier addressed the SCA and Richland's argument that it was too complex to bear on the reasonableness of Quon's expectation of privacy. \"It certainly may be not the end-all to the question, but it should be a factor in determining whether or not there’s going to be an expectation of privacy\". Scalia said he had not been aware of the statute, and asked if it was reasonable to assume that Quon did. \"Petitioners make an argument that because there is this California Public Records Act, that that may diminish one's expectation of privacy\", Dammeier said. \"Certainly, if we're going to have that, then we should also be having the Stored Communications Act.\"\n\nThe rest of Dammeier's argument was devoted to the issue of the other respondents' privacy expectations in communicating with Quon, after Sotomayor asked him if they could prevail even if Quon did not. Dammeier likened the department's actions to going to the post office to get letters sent to Quon instead of his house. Scalia pointed out that Quon could have obtained hard copies of the messages and circulated them himself. \"[W]hen I get a piece of mail from somebody, I could do that as well\", the lawyer replied, \"but that doesn't mean that the government gets to go to the post office and get my mail before I get it\". Richland replied in his rebuttal argument that \"the truth is that all of these plaintiffs admitted that they knew that this was a department-issued pager, and this wasn't a post office\".\n\nThe Court handed down its decision in June, near the end of its term. Unanimously, the justices ruled for the city that the review of the texts had been a reasonable work-related search, discussing the difficulties raised by the broader issues involved and ultimately declining to rule on them. Kennedy wrote the majority opinion; Scalia and Stevens added concurrences of their own.\n\nKennedy began by setting forth the facts of the case, its legal history and the relevant laws and precedent. In the opinion's third section, he cautiously considered the question of Quon's privacy expectation. \"The judiciary risks error by elaborating too fully on the Fourth Amendment implications of emerging technology before its role in society has become clear,\" he observed, referencing the Court's \"Olmstead v. United States\" decision in 1928, in which it had permitted warrantless wiretapping on the grounds that the wiretaps did not actually enter the property of the bootleggers under investigation, and the \"Katz v. United States\" decision which overruled it four decades later.\n\nIn that latter case, he wrote, the Court had the \"knowledge and experience\" to conclude that there was a reasonable expectation of privacy in a telephone booth. \"It is not so clear that courts at present are on so sure a ground\". He elaborated on these uncertainties, referring to the \"amici\" briefs filed by the EFF and NYIPLA:\n\nFor instance, he noted that the ready availability of cell phones made them potentially \"necessary instruments for self-expression, even self-identification\", strengthening a privacy claim. But at the same time they were affordable enough that anyone wanting one for such a purpose could buy their own rather than use one provided by an employer\n\n\"A broad holding concerning employees' privacy expectations vis-à-vis employer-provided technological equipment might have implications for future cases that cannot be predicted,\" Kennedy wrote. \"It is preferable to dispose of this case on narrower grounds.\" He accepted, for argument's sake, three points: that Quon had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his pager messages, that the review of them constituted a search and that the same principles governing a physical search of a public employee's workspace applied to electronic privacy.\n\nOn those grounds, the search had been reasonable under \"O'Connor\". Its inception, to see whether the city needed a higher character limit, was legitimately work-related. Review of the content of the messages was an \"efficient and expedient\" way of achieving that goal, Kennedy wrote. The OPD's decision to limit the review to just two months' worth of messages, and redact those sent when Quon was off duty further bolstered its case.\n\nWhile Quon could have had some expectation of privacy, Kennedy continued, it could not have been enough to prevent a review of the messages. Not only had he been told of the possibility of an audit, but as a police officer \"he would or should have known that his actions were likely to come under legal scrutiny, and that this might entail an analysis of his on-the-job communications\". And, in particular, since the city had purchased pagers for SWAT team members to improve their performance in that capacity, it was reasonable to expect that the city might audit those pagers to assess the performance of both the units and the pagers in SWAT situations.\n\nCiting the same precedent cases that Ikuta had in her dissent from the rehearing denial, Kennedy said the Ninth Circuit erred in suggesting less intrusive means would have yielded the same information. After quoting from those cases to the effect that the text was not required and that letting judges apply it would make effective investigations almost impossible, he concluded that \"[e]ven assuming there were ways that OPD could have performed the search that would have been less intrusive, it does not follow that the search as conducted was unreasonable.\"\n\nHe could not find any legal authority or precedent for the respondents' argument that the SCA violation, which was not before the Court, rendered the search \"per se\" unconstitutional. To the contrary, he pointed to the \"Virginia v. Moore\" case decided the previous term, in which evidence from a search conducted after an illegal arrest was ruled admissible since statutory violations did not inherently constitute Fourth Amendment violations. Nor would an SCA violation have rendered the actions of petitioners unconstitutional since they themselves did not violate it. \"The otherwise reasonable search by OPD is not rendered unreasonable by the assumption that Arch Wireless violated the SCA by turning over the transcripts\".\n\nLastly, he ruled that the other respondents beside Quon had not suffered a violation of their privacy. The respondents had, Kennedy wrote, simply argued that a violation of Quon's privacy necessarily violated that of those he exchanged messages with, and did not make a case that they could have suffered a violation even if Quon had not. Since the Court had found that Quon's Fourth Amendment rights were not violated, it therefore had to hold that the others' were not, either.\n\nStevens' brief concurrence approved of the Court's decision not to resolve the split in standards left by \"O'Connor\". He noted that the facts of the case argued more strongly for the standard proposed by Justice Harry Blackmun in his dissent, which Stevens had joined. Blackmun had said the justices should adopt neither the plurality's \"operational realities\" standard nor Scalia's reasonable-in-the-private-sector alternative, but instead consider the circumstances of each particular search. In this case, he reiterated his line of reasoning from oral argument, that Quon's position as a police officer would have seriously limited his expectation of privacy.\n\nScalia, too, began by addressing \"O'Connor\". The intervening years had not changed his position that the plurality's position in that case was \"standardless and unsupported.\" Nor, a footnote responding to Stevens added, was the approach of that case's dissent relevant unless it was overruled at some point. Applying the test from his concurrence in that case to the instant case, he wrote, \"the proper threshold inquiry should be not whether the Fourth Amendment applies to messages on \"public\" employees' employer-issued pagers, but whether it applies \"in general\" to such messages on employer-issued pagers\". But it was unnecessary to answer that question since he agreed with the majority that the search had been reasonable.\n\nSince, he felt, that was all the Court needed to say, the majority's \"excursus on the complexity and consequences of answering ... that admittedly irrelevant threshold question\" was similarly a waste of effort. \"To whom do we owe an \"additional\" explanation for declining to decide an issue, once we have explained that it makes no difference?\" He then excoriated the majority's \"exaggerated\" case for restraint:\n\nIt was \"a heavy-handed hint\" to lower courts and future litigants that was likely to encourage even more such suits in the future. \"In short, in saying why it is not saying more, the Court says much more than it should.\"\n\nLastly, he found it ironic that the Court had relied on the plurality standard in \"O'Connor\", since its discussion would make it even harder to assess what the operating realities of the workplace were. \"Any rule that requires evaluating whether a given gadget is a 'necessary instrumen[t] for self-expression, even self-identification,' on top of assessing the degree to which 'the law's treatment of [workplace norms has] evolve[d],' ... is (to put it mildly) unlikely to yield objective answers.\"\n\nCommentary on the decision focused on the broader issues the Court did not decide. An editorial in \"The New York Times\" praised the majority's restraint. \"Holding off from making broad pronouncements in the midst of a rapidly changing technology environment is a wise display of restraint by the court,\" agreed \"The Washington Post\" three weeks later. The EFF likewise praised the limited scope of the decision and found \"hopeful hints\" in Kennedy's explanation of the cautious approach suggesting that the Court would \"cautiously make such decisions based on society's privacy expectations and its level of reliance on new communications technologies\". It called on Congress to pass proposed legislation that addressed these issues.\n\nEPIC president Marc Rotenberg was dismayed by the Court's caution. \"[T]he court could have done what it has done in the past and updated constitutional safeguards in light of new technology\", as it did in \"Katz\", he said in a letter responding to the \"Times\" editorial. That case had influenced privacy law internationally, and \"the court's reluctance to assess these privacy issues also means that it will have less influence on other high courts that address similar questions\".\n\nScalia's criticism was echoed by Eleventh Circuit judge Frank M. Hull in a case reheard to take \"Quon\" into account. In March 2010, she had written for a panel deciding \"Rehberg v. Paulk\", a case in which a Georgia man had sued the Dougherty County district attorney alleging malicious prosecution for an investigation into harassing faxes sent to a local hospital. Rehberg had also claimed his privacy was violated by his Internet Service Provider's (ISP) release of his emails from its server in response to a subpoena.\n\nNo appeals court had yet been called upon to decide whether users had a reasonable expectation of privacy over the content of email. Hull's opinion extrapolated from older precedents on postal and telephone communications, along with more recent cases from district courts and a Tenth Circuit ruling on email addresses, to assert that there was no reasonable expectation of privacy over email content once it reached a third-party server, since it was transmitted from there to other servers and copied and archived along the way. There was at the time no settled law on the subject, and privacy advocates expressed concern and criticized the decision. After \"Quon\", the panel granted rehearing.\n\nThe new decision, handed down a month after \"Quon\", followed it in declining to establish a precedent. \"The Supreme Court's more-recent precedent shows a marked lack of clarity in what privacy expectations as to content of electronic communications are reasonable...Given the lack of precedent, we now question whether it would be prudent in this case and on this limited factual record to establish broad precedent as to the reasonable privacy expectation in email content\". The panel thus limited its decision to finding for the appellees on qualified immunity grounds.\n\nThe criticism from within and without led to an article by \"New York Times\" Supreme Court reporter Adam Liptak finding \"Quon\" emblematic of two trends observers found increasingly problematic in Roberts Court opinions: vagueness, and apparent unanimity undermined by multiple concurring opinions. It had been among the record 77% of unanimous decisions from the term with at least one concurrence; as for the former issue, he characterized Hull's description of \"Quon\" as calling it \"almost aggressively unhelpful to lawyers and judges\".\n\nA \"Harvard Law Review\" article criticized the decision, concurring with Scalia and Hull that it provided \"no helpful guidance\" to lower courts in resolving similar cases. \"[I]ts reluctance to devise an intelligible principle for Fourth Amendment rights regarding technology will have the negative effect of causing lower courts to rely on \"O'Connor\" to an even greater extent, [allowing] judges...to reach whatever conclusion they want. The Court should have ruled that public employees do not enjoy a reasonable expectation of privacy when sending text messages from government-issued devices.\"\n\nThe article noted the irony of Kennedy's musings about the difficulty of crafting privacy standards with technology evolving at a rapid pace when applied to a case that turned on text messages sent on \"two-way pager devices that were issued to employees a decade ago and that would likely be deemed antiquated by today's teenagers and young professionals\", who largely tend to use cell phones for texting. \"Presumably, societal norms with respect to pagers are as developed as they will ever be.\" Nor could it see work-related employer-issued pagers or other devices being used for self-expressive purposes as Kennedy suggested, since they were functionally no different from any other such item a police department might issue to officers, \"much like a police officer's patrol cruiser or sidearm\". It did concede that the conflict between the department's written policy and Lt. Duke's verbal assurances to Quon made the issue more complex in this particular case.\n\nThe Court's apparent suggestion that \"any technology can be seen as emerging\", the \"Review\" suggested, would not only lead to muddled future jurisprudence, but was in contrast to various lower courts' more successful efforts to do so. \"While it may be true that technological advances and the increased availability of advanced mobile handsets to individual consumers have blurred the line between private life and the workplace\", the article concluded, \"it does not necessarily follow that a user has a reasonable expectation of privacy on workplace equipment provided by the employer\". As Kennedy had also noted, the proliferation of personal communications devices could make workers more respectful of those distinctions. The \"Review\" cited as an example the widespread use of email from work computers.\n\nAnother commentator took it upon herself to address the issues the Court left unresolved, even before it had heard oral arguments. \"Because this holding is so limited, it practically begs for a new case to address the issue more broadly\", wrote Amanda Higgins of the Ninth Circuit's opinions, in the \"Oklahoma Journal of Law and Technology\". She agreed with Ikuta's criticism of the panel decision, but argued that the panel should have devoted more attention to the larger issues of Quon's expectation of privacy. \"To focus the analysis elsewhere is less than helpful in this already murky area of law\".\n\nThe jury's finding that the audit was legitimately work-related and not an investigation of misconduct may ultimately have hurt the city, Higgins wrote, since it focused attention on whether it was necessary to read the messages. Had it been found to be investigatory, there would have been more grounds to rule the audit a reasonable search. Other public employers facing similar litigation \"will want to get on the court record that their search was for some purpose that will not only pass as reasonable at its inception under the facts of the case...and will also allow the court to find that the actual method was not excessive in relation to the purpose\". They would be best served, she concluded, by making clear, explicit policies on personal use of communications devices and rigorously enforcing those policies. Informal policies in partial or complete conflict with formal ones had created problems for employers in other areas of the law, and it was better to prevent such lawsuits from arising altogether.\n\n\n"}

Various scholars have attempted to articulate criteria for identifying close cases, and commentators have observed that reliance upon precedent established in close cases leads to the gradual expansion of legal doctrines.\n\nAlthough some scholars have suggested that \"a close case is in the eye of the beholder\", other scholars have attempted to articulate specific criteria for identifying close cases. Maureen Armoor, for example, defines close cases as \"the articulable outer limit of judicial discretion that most closely approximates the phenomenological experience of a sitting judge, in particular the dimension of discretion called into play when a judge is uncertain about an outcome\". Ward Farnsworth, dean of the University of Texas School of Law, has suggested that close cases could be defined as either \"cases close enough to provoke dissent\" or cases that \"are flexible enough to comfortably admit of more than one reading\". Likewise, a 1980 comment in the \"Stanford Law Review\" defined close cases as appellate decisions that generated multiple dissenting opinions.\n\nNorthwestern University law professor John E. Coons observed that \"[u]nder a system of winner-take-all the one-sided result reached upon principle in the close case must continue to trouble the conscience of the law\". Judge Guido Calabresi, a former dean of Yale Law School, noted that close cases create a \"slippery slope\", where the \"next close case comes up and the precedent [established in the last close case] is applied: same thing, same thumb on the scale, same decision\". Calabresi argued that this process ultimately leads to the ongoing expansion of doctrine that was originally established only on a narrow basis. Additionally, Ward Farnsworth has argued that judges often resolve close cases \"according to beliefs the judges bring to the case that don’t owe much to law\".\n\n"}
{"id": "35554652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35554652", "title": "Club Resorts Ltd v Van Breda", "text": "Club Resorts Ltd v Van Breda\n\nClub Resorts Ltd v Van Breda, 2012 SCC 17, is a decision of the Supreme Court of Canada that has brought greater certainty to the question of a real and substantial connection in the assumption of civil jurisdiction by Canadian courts in matters concerning the conflict of laws.\n\nIn separate cases, two individuals were injured while on vacation outside of Canada. Van Breda suffered catastrophic injuries on a beach in Cuba, and Charron died while scuba diving there. Actions were brought in Ontario against a number of parties, including Club Resorts Ltd., a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands, that managed the two hotels where the accidents occurred.\n\nClub Resorts sought to block those proceedings, arguing that:\n\nIn both cases, the judges at first instance held that Ontario courts did have jurisdiction, and that an Ontario court was the more appropriate forum. The two cases were heard together by the Ontario Court of Appeal, where the appeals were both dismissed. Both were subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\nIn a 7-0 ruling, both appeals were dismissed.\n\nLebel J. observed that the case concerned the elaboration of the real and substantial connection test as an appropriate common law conflicts rule for the assumption of jurisdiction. In determining whether a court can assume jurisdiction over a certain claim, the preferred approach in Canada has been to rely on a set of specific factors which are given presumptive effect, as opposed to a regime based on an exercise of almost pure and individualized judicial discretion.\n\nJurisdiction must be established primarily on the basis of objective factors that connect the legal situation or the subject matter of the litigation with the forum. In a case concerning a tort, the following factors are presumptive connecting factors that, \"prima facie\", entitle a court to assume jurisdiction over a dispute:\n\nThe list above is not an exhaustive one. In identifying new presumptive factors, a court should look to connections that give rise to a relationship with the forum that is similar in nature to the ones which result from the listed factors. Relevant considerations include:\n\nA clear distinction must be drawn between the existence and the exercise of jurisdiction. Once jurisdiction is established, if the defendant does not raise further objections, the litigation proceeds before the court of the forum. The court cannot decline to exercise its jurisdiction unless the defendant invokes \"forum non conveniens\". The decision to raise this doctrine rests with the parties, not with the court seized of the claim. If a defendant raises an issue of \"forum non conveniens\", the burden is on him or her to show why the court should decline to exercise its jurisdiction and displace the forum chosen by the plaintiff. Ultimately, the decision falls within the reasoned discretion of the trial court. This exercise of discretion will be entitled to deference from higher courts, absent an error of law or a clear and serious error in the determination of relevant facts which takes place at an interlocutory or preliminary stage.\n\nIn the \"Van Breda\" case:\n\nTherefore, the Ontario court was the more appropriate venue.\n\nIn the \"Charron\" case:\n\nTherefore, considerations of fairness to the parties weighed heavily in favour of the plaintiffs.\n\n\"Van Breda\" builds upon the jurisprudence the SCC has established in this matter, which includes the previous rulings issued in:\n\nIt also replaces a previous attempt by the Ontario Court of Appeal to standardize the jurisprudence in this area in \"Muscutt v. Courcelles\".\n\n\"Van Breda\" was immediately applied to two other judgments handed down by the SCC on the same day, which were concerned with libel:\n\nIn both of these cases, the Ontario court was determined to be the most appropriate forum as well. This has raised the concern that the incidence of libel tourism to Canadian courts may increase as a result. In addition, the question of which substantive law should be applied in multijurisdictional claims has been left unresolved.\n\nThe determination of whether an entity is carrying on a business in a Canadian jurisdiction is also impacted, as the SCC expressed a preference for a physical presence, as opposed to a virtual presence. This may need to be explored further in future cases.\n\n\"Van Breda\" also confirms that foreign companies that reside, conduct business or enter into agreements in a Canadian province will be subject to its jurisdiction, unless they can rebut the presumption of a real and substantial connection to the Canadian jurisdiction, or include exclusive forum or arbitration clauses in their contracts.\n"}

The Copyright Alliance also directly collaborates with and represents thousands of creative individuals and small businesses. The creative industries represented include writers, composers, recording artists, journalists, documentarians, filmmakers, graphic artists, visual artists, photographers, and software developers.\n\nAt its launch in May 2007, the Copyright Alliance was founded by four Board members, ASCAP, Broadcast Music Inc., the Motion Picture Association of America and Universal. It was initially created and masterminded by the President and CEO Jack Valenti, of the Motion Picture Association of America. Music Legends Steve Cropper and Lamont Dozier attended the launch, that included a membership of 29 organizations purporting to represent 11 million workers, including the Association of American Publishers, Microsoft, the Recording Industry Association of America, Viacom and Walt Disney.\n\nThe launch of the Copyright Alliance was supported by U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers (D-MI), ranking Representative Howard Coble (R-NC), and Representative Howard Berman (D-CA), members of the United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, Competition, and the Internet. Berman, speaking of his inspiration by the late Jack Valenti, spoke of \"the constant assaults on copyright law\" and called the group's launch \"a tremendous idea\". Coble said that \"Digitization and related technologies beg some changes to the copyright laws, and I wish you the best of luck and my support as you roll out the Copyright Alliance\".\n\nThe Copyright Alliance was launched in opposition to the Digital Freedom Campaign, formed the preceding October, whose members include the Consumer Electronics Association, Public Knowledge, and the Electronic Freedom Foundation.\n\nPatrick Ross served as executive director for four years until succeeded by Sandra Aistars on December 20, 2010. Prior to taking the position Aistars was Vice President and Associate General Counsel at Time Warner.

{"id": "1660599", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1660599", "title": "Crofting", "text": "Crofting\n\nCrofting is a form of land tenure and small-scale food production particular to the Scottish Highlands, the islands of Scotland, and formerly on the Isle of Man.\nWithin the 19th century townships, individual crofts are established on the better land, and a large area of poorer-quality hill ground is shared by all the crofters of the township for grazing of their livestock.\n\nCrofting is a traditional social system in Scotland defined by small-scale food production. Crofting is characterised by its common working communities, or \"townships\". Individual crofts are typically established on of in-bye for better quality forage, arable and vegetable production. Each township manages poorer-quality hill ground as common grazing for cattle and sheep.\n\nLand use in the crofting counties is constrained by climate, soils and topography. Since the late 20th century, the government has classified virtually all of the agriculture land in the Highlands and Islands as Severely Disadvantaged, under the terms of Less Favoured Area (LFA) Directive, yet these areas still receive the lowest LFA payments. Most crofters cannot survive economically by crofting agriculture alone, and they pursue a number of activities to earn their livelihood.\n\nDespite its challenges, crofting is important to the Highlands and Islands. In 2014-15 there were 19,422 crofts, with 15,388 crofters. Some crofters have the tenancy of more than one croft, and in-croft absenteeism means that tenancies are held but crofts are not farmed.\nAbout 33,000 family members lived in crofting households, or around 10% of the population of the Highlands and Islands. Crofting households represented around 30% those in the rural areas of the Highlands, and up to 65% of households in Shetland, the Western Isles and Skye.\nThere were 770,000 hectares under crofting tenure, roughly 25% of the agricultural land area in the Crofting Counties. Crofters held around 20% of all beef cattle (120,000 head) and 45% of breeding ewes (1.5 million sheep).\n\nTenants and owner-occupier crofters are required to comply with a range of duties specified in sections 5AA to 5C and 19C of the Crofters (Scotland) Act 1993 as amended. There is a duty to be ordinarily resident within 32km of the croft. If the croft is the sole dwelling and the crofter's family are resident while the croft is away this would probably be accepted as ordinarily resident. Other circumstances involving other places of residence would require to be assessed individually. In addition to the duty of residence tenants and owner occupier crofters are required to ensure the croft is cultivated, maintained and not neglected or misused.\n\nCrofting communities were a product of the Highland Clearances (though individual crofts had existed before the clearances). They replaced the farms or \"bailtean\", which had common grazing and arable open fields operated on the run rig system. This change was typically associated with two things. Firstly the tacksmen were steadily eliminated over the last quarter of the 18th century. A tacksman (a member of the \"daoine uaisle\", sometimes described as \"gentry\" in English) was the holder of a lease or \"tack\" from the landowner. Where a lease was for a \"baile\", the tacksman usually sublet to the farming tenants and may have provided some management oversight. By preventing this section of society from sub-letting, the landlords obtained all of the rent paid by those who worked the land. Secondly, landowners replaced the older farming methods with pastoral systems. In early cases, these were based on cattle. Much more common was the introduction of extensive sheep farms. In many clearances, the tenants of inland farms were moved to crofting communities in coastal areas, leaving the land they had left for sheep. This type of clearance was carried out mostly until the 1820s.\n\nThe crofts created by clearance were not intended to support all the needs of those who lived there, and consequently were restricted in size to a few acres of arable land with a surrounding shared grazing. Landlords intended their crofting tenants to work in various industries, such as fishing or kelp. A contemporary estimate was that a crofter needed to carry out 200 days work away from his croft in order to avoid destitution. In the second half of the 19th century, many crofters provided a substantial migrant workforce, especially for lowland farms.\n\nCrofting communities were badly hit by the Highland Potato Famine. The small arable plots had meant that the potato was an essential crop, due to its high productivity. The arrival of potato blight (and the collapse of the kelp industry a few years before) made some crofting communities inviable. This gave rise to the second phase of the Highland Clearances, when many tenants left the Highlands, often emigrating. \n\nIn the 21st century, crofting is found predominantly in the rural Western and Northern isles and in the coastal fringes of the western and northern Scottish mainland.\n\nThe Crofters' Holdings (Scotland) Act 1886 provided for security of tenure, a key issue as most crofters remain tenants. The Act encouraged tenants to improve the land under their control, as it ensured that the control could be transferred within families and passed to future generations.\n\nCroft work was hard, back-breaking work which yielded a subsistence living.\n\nThe Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 gives crofters the right to buy their land.\n\n\nArticles\n"}
{"id": "216345", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=216345", "title": "Defense of infancy", "text": "Defense of infancy\n\nThe defense of infancy is a form of defense known as an excuse so that defendants falling within the definition of an \"infant\" are excluded from criminal liability for their actions, if at the relevant time, they had not reached an age of criminal responsibility. After reaching the initial age, there may be levels of responsibility dictated by age and the type of offense committed.\n\nUnder the English common law the defense of infancy was expressed as a set of presumptions in a doctrine known as doli incapax. A child under the age of seven was presumed incapable of committing a crime. The presumption was conclusive, prohibiting the prosecution from offering evidence that the child had the capacity to appreciate the nature and wrongfulness of what they had done. Children aged seven to under fourteen were presumed incapable of committing a crime but the presumption was rebuttable. The prosecution could overcome the presumption by proving that the child understood what they were doing and that it was wrong. In fact, capacity was a necessary element of the state's case. If the state failed to offer sufficient evidence of capacity, the infant was entitled to have the charges dismissed at the close of the state's evidence. \"Doli incapax\" was abolished in England and Wales in 1998, but persists in other common law jurisdictions.\n\nThe terminology regarding such a defense varies by jurisdiction and sphere. Instances of usage have included the terms age of accountability, age of responsibility, age of criminal responsibility and age of liability. The rationale behind the \"age of accountability\" laws are the same as those behind the insanity defense, insinuating both the mentally disabled and the young lack apprehension.\n\nGovernments enact laws to label certain types of activity as wrongful or illegal. Behaviour of a more antisocial nature can be stigmatized in a more positive way to show society's disapproval through the use of the word \"criminal\". In this context, laws tend to use the phrase, \"age of criminal responsibility\" in two different ways:\nThus, each state is considering whether any given child has committed an offense, and given that answer, what the most appropriate measures would be for dealing with a child who has done what this child did. It is noted that, in some states, a link is made between infancy as a defense and defenses that diminish responsibility on the ground of a mental illness. Distinctions between children, young offenders, juveniles, etc. are used to denote matching levels of incapacity. The majority view is that this linkage is not constructive in that it implies that children are in some way mentally defective whereas they merely lack the judgment that comes with age and experience.\n\nThis is an aspect of the public policy of \"parens patriae\". In the criminal law, each state will consider the nature of its own society and the available evidence of the age at which antisocial behaviors begins to manifest itself. Some societies will have qualities of indulgence toward the young and inexperienced, and will not wish them to be exposed to the criminal law system before all other avenues of response have been exhausted. Hence, some states have a policy of \"doli incapax\" (i.e. incapable of wrong) and exclude liability for all acts and omissions that would otherwise have been criminal up to a specified age. Hence, no matter what the infant may have done, there cannot be a criminal prosecution. However, although no criminal liability is inferred, other aspects of law may be applied. For example, in Nordic countries, an offense by a person under 15 years of age is considered mostly a symptom of problems in child's development. This will cause the social authorities to take appropriate administrative measures to secure the development of the child. Such measures may range from counseling to placement at special care unit. Being non-judicial, the measures are not dependent on the severity of the offense committed but on the overall circumstances of the child.\n\nThe policy of treating minors as incapable of committing crimes does not necessarily reflect modern sensibilities. Thus, if the rationale of the excuse is that children below a certain age lack the capacity to form the \"mens rea\" of an offense, this may no longer be a sustainable argument. Indeed, given the different speeds at which people may develop both physically and intellectually, any form of explicit age limit may be arbitrary and irrational. Yet, the sense that children do not deserve to be exposed to criminal punishment in the same way as adults remains strong. Children have not had experience of life, nor do they have the same mental and intellectual capacities as adults. Hence, it might be considered unfair to treat young children in the same way as adults.\n\nIn Scotland the age of criminal responsibility is currently eight years, however age of criminal prosecution was raised to 12 in 2010. In England and Wales and Northern Ireland the age of responsibility is ten years and in the Netherlands and Canada, the age of responsibility is twelve years. Sweden, Finland, and Norway all set the age at fifteen years. In the United States, the age varies between states, being as low as six years in South Carolina and seven years in 35 states; 11 years is the minimum age for federal crimes.\n\nAs the treaty parties of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court could not agree on a minimum age for criminal responsibility, they chose to solve the question procedurally and excluded the jurisdiction of the Court for persons under eighteen years.\n\nSome countries refuse to set a fixed minimum age, but leave discretion to prosecutors to argue or the judges to rule on whether the child or adolescent (\"juvenile\") defendant understood that what was being done was wrong. If the defendant did not understand the difference between \"right\" and \"wrong\", it may not be considered appropriate to treat such a person as culpable. Alternatively, the lack of real fault in the offender can be recognized by rulings that dispense mitigated criminal sentences or address more practical matters of parental responsibility by adjusting the rights of parents to unsupervised custody, or by separate criminal proceedings against the parents for breach of their duties as parents.\n\nThe following are the minimum ages at which people may be charged with a criminal offence in each country:\n\nChild imprisonment is a concept in criminal law where people are considered not old enough to be held responsible for their criminal acts. The main problem in most countries is whether children should be punished as an adult for crimes committed as a juvenile, or if special treatment is a better solution for the offender.\n\nIn some countries, a juvenile court is a court of special jurisdiction charged with adjudicating cases involving crimes committed by those who have not yet reached a specific age. If convicted in a juvenile court, the offender is found \"responsible\" for their actions as opposed to \"guilty\" for a criminal offense. Sometimes, in some jurisdictions (such as the United States) a minor may be tried as an adult.\n\n\n"}

Per the terms of the Tanggu Truce, any disputes that could not be resolved by the Peace Preservation Corps would be settled by agreement through direct discussions between the Japanese and Chinese governments.\n\nA secret clause of the Tanggu Truce excluded any of the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies from the Peace Preservation Corps. This effectively meant that the Japanese Army was able to dominate the Peace Preservation Corp with demobilized troops from the collaborationist proxy Chinese armies which had participated in the Battle of Rehe and the subsequent attack on the Great Wall and the intrusion into Hebei. Some 1,000 men were recruited into the Corps from the former troops of warlord Shih Yusan and a further 2,000 men from the forces of Li Chi-chun.\n\nAt the end of 1935, with the proclamation of the Autonomous Government of Eastern Hopei, the Peace Preservation Corps was disbanded, and its forces were absorbed into the new East Hopei Army.\n\n"}

{"id": "1527309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1527309", "title": "Farm (revenue leasing)", "text": "Farm (revenue leasing)\n\nFarming or tax-farming is a technique of financial management, namely the process of commuting (changing), by its assignment by legal contract to a third party, a future uncertain revenue stream into fixed and certain periodic rents, in consideration for which commutation a discount in value received is suffered. It is most commonly used in the field of public finance, where the state wishes to gain some certainty about its future taxation revenue for the purposes of medium-term budgetting of expenditure. The tax collection process requires considerable expenditure on administration and the yield is uncertain both as to amount and timing, as taxpayers delay or default on their assessed obligations, often the result of unforeseen external forces such as bad weather affecting harvests. Governments (the lessors) have thus frequently over history resorted to the services of an entrepreneurial financier (the farmer) to whom they lease or assign the right to collect and retain the whole of the tax revenue due to the state in return for his payment into the treasury of fixed sums (sometimes called \"rents\", but with a different meaning from the common modern term). Sometimes (Miguel de Cervantes is an example) the tax farmer was a government employee, paid a salary, and all monies collected went to the government.\n\nTax farmers did not usually deal with individuals; the tax was imposed on a community or other polity, and how the community raised the funds to pay the tax was its own business. Tax farming usually required on-site tax-collecting visits, as postal and banking systems were inadequate or non-existent.\n\nFarming in this sense has nothing to do with agriculture, other than metaphorically.\n\nThere are two possible origins for \"farm\".\n\nSome sources derive \"farm\" with its French version \"ferme\", most notably used in the context of the Fermiers Generaux, from the mediaeval Latin \"firma\", meaning \"a fixed agreement, contract\", ultimately from the classical Latin adjective \"firmus\", \"firma\", \"firmum\", meaning \"firm, strong, stout, steadfast, immoveable, sure, to be relied upon\". The modern agricultural sense of the word stems from the same origin, in that a medieval land-\"holder\" (none \"owned\" land but the king himself under his allodial title) under feudal land tenure might let it (i.e. lease it out) under a contract as a going concern (not as a sub-infeudated fee), that is to say as a unit producing a revenue stream, together with its workers, livestock and deadstock (i.e. implements), for exploitation by a tenant who was licensed by the contract, or \"firma\", to keep all the revenue he could extract from the holding in exchange for fixed rents. Thus the rights to the revenue stream produced by the land had been farmed by the lessor (therefore strictly perhaps the \"farmor\") and the tenant became the \"holder of the farm\", or to coin a word, \"farmee\". Because this was the form of the farming transaction most known to popular society, the word \"farmer\" became synonymous with a tenant of an agricultural holding.\n\nAccording to other sources, the word \"farm\" comes from Middle English \"ferme\" (\"farm, rent, revenue; revenue collected from a farmer; factor, stewardship, meal, feast\"), from Old English \"feorm, farm\" (\"provision, stores of food, supplies, possessions; provisions supplied to the king or a lord by a tenant or vassal; rent, feast, benefit, assylum\"), from Proto-Germanic *\"firmō, *firχumō\" (\"means of living, subsistence\"), from Proto-Indo-European *\"perku-\" (\"life, strength, force\"). It is related to other Old English words such as \"feormehām\" (\"farm\"), \"feormere\" (\"purveyor, grocer\"), \"feormian\" (\"to provision, sustain\"), and \"feorh\" (\"life, spirit\"). The Old English word is stated by these sources as having unusually been borrowed by Medieval Latin as \"firma\" or \"ferma\" and to have provided the Old French \"ferme\" \"farm\", Occitan \"ferma\" \"farm\". This is refuted by those sources which state \"firma\" to derive from classical Latin \"firmus\". The word continued the same senses of \"rent, farmed office, source of revenue, feast\". The meaning \"rent, fixed payment\", which was already present in the Old English word, was further strengthened due to the word's resemblance to the unrelated (so say these sources) Latin \"firmus\" (\"firm, solid\"), and \"firmitas\" (\"security, firmness\").\n\nThe tenant of a farm can only make a profit if he makes a careful assessment of its value. Although modern financial management theory has reduced such calculations to scientific formulae, the mind of the astute financier of past ages would have well understood the calculations involved, whether they were performed mentally or by making marks in the sand. An estimate is made of the long-term average yearly gross value of the revenue stream in question, which can be derived from examination of past records and accounts, adjusted for any new circumstances affecting the future. Then a discount for a risk element is deducted with a further discount deducted for the time value of money. The risk in question relates to the possibility of some of the debts forming the revenue stream being defaulted on or paid late. This causes variability in the revenue stream. These concepts must always have been second-nature to the successful merchant throughout the ages. The resultant figure forms the maximum rent the tenant is willing to pay to the lessee of the farm. His profit becomes the excess of whatever revenues he can extract from the farm less the rents payable, less his administration, levying and collection expenses. The skill of the tenant of a farm is therefore firstly in negotiating a favourable rent which he does by overstating the riskiness (variability) of the cash flow stream in question and secondly in his management of the debts thus assigned to him, that is to say his skills as a debt-collector and manager in general. He must also be satisfied that he has the ability to enforce payment of the debts, ultimately by use of a court of law, in which he must pay the standard fee for bringing a suit, under the legal system generally instituted by the government authority which is the lessor of the farm. He does not act as the lessor's agent but as a principal.\n\nTax farming was originally a Roman practice whereby the burden of tax collection was reassigned by the Roman State to private individuals or groups. In essence, these individuals or groups paid the taxes for a certain area and for a certain period of time and then attempted to cover their outlay by collecting money or saleable goods from the people within that area. The system was set up by Gaius Gracchus in 123 BC primarily to increase the efficiency of tax collection within Rome itself but the system quickly spread to the Provinces. Within the Roman Empire, these private individuals and groups which collected taxes in lieu of the bid (i.e. rent) they had paid to the state were known as \"publicani\", of whom the best known is the disciple Matthew, a \"publicanus\" in the village of Capernaum in the province of Galilee. The system was widely abused, and reforms were enacted by Augustus and Diocletian. Tax farming practices are believed to have contributed to the fall of the Western Roman Empire in Western Europe.\n\nMediaeval English kings frequently made grants \"in fee-farm\", a form of feudal tenure. An example is the following writ of King William II (1087–1100) granting a hundred court to be held in fee-farm by Thorney Abbey:\n\nWilliam, king of the English, to all the sheriffs and barons of Huntingdonshire, greeting. Know that I have granted the hundred of Normancross to the abbot and monks of Thorney to be held in fee-farm for an annual rent of 100 shillings which I order them to pay to my sheriff at Huntingdon. And I forbid any of my officers to do them injury or insult in respect of this.\n\nBesides the Romans, historical examples include the tax collection methods of the Ptolemies, Seljuks, Mamluks, Ottomans, the French State prior to Louis XVI (see ferme générale), and Russia prior to 1862. In many cases, such as the Abbasid practice of Iqta, these rights were granted by an authority, in this example the caliph, for services rendered or promised. In the Byzantine \"pronoia\" system, similar rights were often purchased from the crown. Though such arrangements in some respects seem similar to the feudal system, there are significant disparities, including continuance of state power and, at least in the case of \"pronoia\", theoretical time limits on the grant. In many cases, including those mentioned, tax rights were not transferable or divisible, unlike feudal fiefdoms.\n\nTax farming was an important step in the history of economic development by providing a method for collecting taxes across a large area without the need for a tax-collecting bureaucracy, or during periods when such a bureaucracy is unworkable or impossible to maintain. Systems of tax farming similar to the Roman model were used in Ptolemaic Egypt, various medieval Western European countries, the Ottoman and Mughal empires, and in Qing Dynasty China. As states become stronger, buoyed up by revenues brought in by tax farming, the practice was discontinued in favour of centralized tax collection systems. In part this was because tax farming systems tended to rely on wealthy individuals outside the state machinery, gangs, and secret societies.\n\nThe key flaw in the tax farming system is the tension between the state, which seeks a long-term source of taxation revenue, and the tax farmers, who seek to make a profit on their investment in as short a time as possible. As a result, tax-farmers often abuse the taxpayers in various ways, tending them to switch their economic activity from strategic long-term projects to short-term revenue generation. A common abuse by tax farmers is the undervaluation of goods received in lieu of taxes, allowing the tax-farmer to re-sell the goods to create a second profit source. Such abuses stifle economic growth by restricting the ability of the tradesman to reinvest in his business, thereby limiting the quantity of taxes generated over the long-term.\n\nIn Bangladesh and India tolls on bridges and roads and dues from public properties such as lakes and forests are often leased to private persons or firms.\n\nTax farming is not synonymous with modern privatized tax collection, where private individuals or companies collect taxes and pass them to the state in return for a commission or fee, without bearing any risk consequent of default by the taxpayer. Tax farming is speculative, meaning that the tenant of the farm bears the full risk of defaulted debts. In addition, a tenant is often required as a term of the lease to make an early rent payment, which must be financed from his own resources until the revenue stream subject to the farm has started to be collected.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, some tax collection of \"lower value debts\" by HMRC has been outsourced to debt collection agencies from July 2010. However, debt collection agencies, like invoice factors, are not truly farmers of revenue streams, as they do not bear any risk of default. Rather they make loans in expectation of future receipts, such loans being always recoverable and secured on the income stream itself.\n\nIn 1999 the National Board of Revenue in Bangladesh (NBR) negotiated with cigarette producing firms a minimum amount of Value Added Tax (VAT) that should be paid per month even though VAT is an \"ad valorem\" tax, that is to say of variable yield. The NBR took this step because under the self-clearance system monitoring of production and sales of cigarettes proved to be difficult. It was agreed that if the cigarette producing firms paid the minimum revenue fixed by the NBR, physical monitoring would be withdrawn. The NBR resorted to this technique of financial management to avoid the large costs of monitoring while gaining more in revenue with certainty.\n\n\n\n"}

These courts then have the deciding word in those subjects.\n\nOther first-degree civil jurisdictions have a more general purview, but are divided by the \"taux de ressort\", most often as the applicant requests.\n\nThis is the case in the following jurisdictions:\nWhere litigation is not specifically assigned by legislation to another jurisdiction, the \"tribunal de grande instance\" is responsible for litigation on matters involving more than 10 €000. But for litigation arising from real estate, the \"tribunal d'instance\" has authority over litigation evaluated where potential damages range between 4 €000 and €10,000, and the \"juridiction de proximité\" for litigation evaluated at 4 000 € or less.\n\nIn the overseas French possessions (collectivités d'outre-mer), naming sometimes differs from this pattern and a court of first instance (tribunal de première instance) exercises a general review power over first-degree civil jurisdiction.\n\nThe Agricultural land tribunals are responsible for some types of rural litigation.\n\nThe juge des enfants (juvenile judge), according to Article 151-3 of the Code de l'organisation judiciaire, may rule in any matter that concerns educational assistance measures under the conditions specified at Article 375 « pour tout ce qui concerne les mesures d'assistance éducative dans les conditions prévues aux articles 375 et suivants du code civil. »\n\nThere are two categories of criminal jurisdiction: jurisdictions d'instruction \"and the jurisdictions \"de jugement\". This distinction is notably echoed by the Code de procédure pénale, (Code of Penal Procedure), which nevertheless does not define how to distinguish the one from the other. The distinction is even more nuanced to make, since in French procedural law the \"judgment\" jurisdictions also have powers of investigation (d'instruction)\".\n\nA jurisdiction \"d'instruction\" has powers of criminal investigation and can proceed or cause to proceed different investigations: it can hear witnesses and civil parties (parties civiles), search, seal, appoint and expert, put a suspect in temporary detention or in detention under judiciary supervision, and rule on the different questions that arise in the course of criminal investigation, such as the return of seized assets.\n\nA judge in a court \"de jugement\" has the same powers, but generally makes only limited use of them, since the juge d'instruction has already done so. The essential function of a cour de judgement is to determine the guilt of defendants under criminal law and to sentence those it finds guilty.\n\nPenal jurisdictions judge infractions, and they also determine the civil consequences of committing the infraction.\n\nThe \"tribunal de police\" judges \"contraventions\". The \"tribunal correctionnel\" judges \"délits\". The \"cour d'assises\" and the \"criminal tribunal \"(in Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon) judge crimes, according to where they were committed. The \"commercial maritime tribunal\" is a jurisdiction d'exception, but it has been composed in the same way as jurisdictions of common law such as the correctional tribunal since the decision of the constitutional council of July 2, 2010.\n\nThe \"judge of l'application des peines\" and the tribunal de l'application des peines decide the application of criminal penalties, especially with respect to prisoners.\n\nEight regional jurisdictions for rétention de sûreté decide matters of retention, after their periods of incarceration, of persons found guilty of certain serious offences and who are adjudged to still be dangerous.\n\nThe elimination of the \"tribunal aux armées de Paris\", the last peacetime military tribunal, was announced for 2011, when they were to be replaced by the common-law correctional tribunal. It took effect 1 January 2012 as a result of the law of 13 December 2011.\n\nInfractions committed by a minor are judged, depending on their severity and also the age of the minor, by the juge des enfants, by the \"tribunal pour enfants\" or by the \"Cour d'assises des mineurs\".\n\nThe Court of Appeal retries the facts of a disputed case previously tried in a court of first instance. This is known as the double degree of jurisdiction (double degré de juridiction).\n\nAt the Court of Appeal level litigation is considered by a single court—although in separate divisions—whether the matter is civil or criminal. Depending on the volume of appeals the number of divisions may vary. There is always, however, at least one civil division, social division, commercial division, and correctional appeals division.\n\nThere are a total of 36 courts of appeal on French territory.\n\nAt the courts of appeal, in criminal law matters:\n\nSaint-Pierre-et-Miquelon has a , which hears the appeals from that jurisdiction.\n\nSince the 2000 , known as the \"loi Guigou\", a special form of d'appeal (called \"tournant\") been available against the arrêts of the Assises court, and the Criminal and Army tribunals: appeals are heard in a different criminal jurisdiction with additional jurés in the case of an Assises court or Criminal tribunal, or assesseurs-jurés in Mayotte). (Although appeals filed against a criminal jurisdiction ruling in an overseas department, New Caledonia, French Polynesia, Wallis and Futuna or Saint Pierre and Miquelon, the appeal may be heard in the same jurisdiction that heard it in first instance, but different judges should sit on the panel that re-tries the case.\n\nThe judicial panel of the national jurisdiction for \"\" (preventive detention) is composed of three councillors from the Court of Cassation (France). It hears appeals of decisions to impose preventive detention on convicted prisoners who have completed their sentence but are still considered dangerous.\n\nThis jurisdiction judges cases where appeals concern incapacitation and work-related injury, sometimes called technical appeals, rendered by the Social Security administration.\n\nThe Court of Cassation does not constitute a third degree of jurisdiction, because unlike the Courts of Appeal, it only addresses the legal form of the verdict. Thus the \"juges du fond\" designation for first and second degree judges, which sometimes appears in cassation court verdicts.\n\nThe Cour de cassation renders two types of verdict: confirmatif or infirmatif.\n\nThe former confirms a verdict by a court of appeal, (or of another court if the case has exhausted the first and last degrees of jurisdiction). The trial theoretically ends at this point, all avenues of recourse having been exhausted. Still, other jurisdictions may be invoked, such as the European Court of Human Rights, but this remains rare.\n\nIf the court's verdict is on the other hand \"infirmatif\", the judgment is \"cassé\", or broken, essentially quashed or canceled. There are then several possibilities:\nIf the matter is sent back to the lower courts, both the facts and the law are retried. The resulting new judgment may also be appealed. The next higher court would be cassation. Here the bench sometimes quashes a verdict without returning it to the lower court, or where a lower court may bow to the \"Cour de cassation \"by rendering a judgment that takes the cassation court's ruling into account.\n\nUnlike the Courts of Appeal, there is only one Cour de cassation, which sits in Paris.\n"}

By way of alternative, the GCDP report \"advocates decriminalizing drug use by those who do no harm to others.\" \n\nThe commission was formed to \"bring to the international level an informed, science-based discussion about humane and effective ways to reduce the harm caused by drugs to people and societies. [It built] on the experience of the Latin American Commission on Drugs and Democracy.\"\n\nAt year-end 2017, GCDP board member George Shultz and economist and former secretary of finance in Mexico Pedro Aspe reaffirmed the message of the commission in a New York Times op-ed.\n\nThe Secretariat is based in Geneva, Switzerland, and handles the daily operations of the Commission. Its work is directed by the Executive Secretary, Khalid Tinasti.\n\nMembers (22 plus five In Memoriam) of the GCDP Board a/o January 2018 were:\n\n\nGabor Maté, a Hungarian-Canadian physician who specializes in study and treatment of addiction, was interviewed on \"Democracy Now!\" about the report.\n\nFormer U.S. President Jimmy Carter wrote an op-ed in \"The New York Times\" explicitly endorsing the recommendations of the commission, saying they were in line with the policies of his administration; and saying it was the policies of the succeeding Reagan administration which had moved U.S. policy so far toward punitive alternatives. Carter's piece elicited several published responses, including one from an analyst for Common Sense for Drug Policy who drew attention to the current White House Office of National Drug Control Policy's immediate rejection of GCDP's recommendations and defense of the \"balanced drug control efforts\" of the U.S. federal government; and others which agreed and disagreed with Carter's views.\n\nBrian Lehrer had Ethan Nadelmann, founder and director of the Drug Policy Alliance, on Lehrer's radio show to detail the GCDP report and how that might impact U.S. anti-drug policies.\n\nSir Ronald Sanders, a consultant and former Caribbean diplomat, wrote in favor of the recommendations and endorsement of President Carter's expressed views.\n\nPeter Hakim prominently cited the GCDP report in an October, 2011, \"rethinking [of] U.S. drug policy\". \n\nThe Beckley Foundation's Global Initiative for Drug Policy Reform antedated the release of the GCDP report but integrated the GCPD into its November, 2011, British House of Lords meetings. Professor Robin Room (University of Melbourne) was preparing a \"Rewriting the UN Drug Conventions Report\" based on amendments to the UN drug control conventions of 1961, 1971 and 1988 for the Initiative; and Professor Stephen Pudney (Institute for Social and Economic Research) was preparing \"the first-ever \"Cost-benefit Analysis\" of the control of cannabis through regulation and taxation in the UK\" for it. Amanda Feilding of the Foundation and other peers led the effort and attracted some criticism for it.\n\n\nOn September 9, 2014 the Commission issued its new report, \"Taking Control: Pathways to Drug Policies that Work\". \"The report reflects the evolution in the thinking of the Commissioners, who reiterate their demands for decriminalization, alternatives to incarceration, and greater emphasis on public health approaches and now also call for permitting the legal regulation of psychoactive substances. The Commission is the most distinguished group of high-level leaders to ever call for such far-reaching changes.\"\n\nIn April 2016, the GCDP reacted to the United Nations General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) drug conference, saying the commission was \"profoundly disappointed with the adopted outcome document\". The Wall Street \"Journal\" lumped the attendees' positions \"somewhat\" in two camps: \"Some European and South American countries as well as the U.S. favored softer approaches. Eastern countries such as China and Russia and most Muslim nations like Iran, Indonesia and Pakistan remained staunchly opposed.\" Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto said “We must move beyond prohibition to effective prevention” and that Mexico was considering legalizing medical marijuana and limited decriminalization of the drug. GCDP member Branson was quoted as saying the conference outcome was \"out of step with world sentiment and doubles down on status quo”.\n\nIn November 2016 GCDP released the report, \"Advancing Drug Policy Reform: a new approach to decriminalization\".\n\nCommission Chair Dreifuss said about the report:\nAfter years of denouncing the dramatic effects of prohibition and the criminalization of people that do no harm but use drugs on the society as a whole, it is time to highlight the benefits of well-designed and well-implemented people-centered drug policies. These innovative policies cannot exist as long as we do not discuss, honestly, the major policy error made in the past, which is the criminalization of personal consumption or possession of illicit psychoactive substances in national laws.\n\nOn 2 October 2017, the Global Commission published a position paper on the opioid crisis in North America. This opioid-driven public health crisis has reached alarming proportions, contributing in 2016 to an estimated 64,000 deaths from drug overdoses in the US, and some 2,500 in Canada. The members of the Global Commission on Drug Policy, several of whom faced similar crises while occupying the highest levels of government in their own countries, share in this position paper their views and recommendations on how to mitigate this epidemic.\n\nWhile previous reports by the Global Commission on Drug Policy showed how the potential harms of drugs for people and communities are exacerbated by repressive drug control policies at local, national and international levels, the Global Commission's 2017 report, \"The World Drug PERCEPTION Problem - Countering Prejudices About People Who Use Drugs\" focuses on how current perceptions of drugs and people who use them feed into and off prohibitionist policies. Indeed, drug policy reforms have been difficult to design, legislate or implement because current policies and responses are often based on perceptions and passionate beliefs, and what should be factual discussions leading to effective policies are frequently treated as moral debates. The present report aims to analyze the most common perceptions and fears, contrast them with available evidence on drugs and the people who use them, and provides recommendations on changes that must be enacted to support reforms toward more effective drug policies.\n\nAVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD WEDNESDAY, 26 SEPTEMBER 2018\n\nThe Sustainable Development Goals and Agenda 2030 are meant to be a transformational agenda to eradicate poverty, achieve gender equity or save the planet through their implementation. This implementation, based on coherent public policies, is still lacking at the national, regional and international levels. This is most visible in drug policy, where voices from health, human rights and science call for reform, while most countries continue to privilege ideology through law-enforcement and militarization.\n\nThe members of the Global Commission on Drug Policy draw from their experience at the highest policy and political levels to provide an analysis of how - beyond powerful words and slogans - sustainable development is impeded by drug control while providing a single, groundbreaking recommendation to address this situation.\n\nThe Global Commission on Drug Policy released its newest report in Mexico City, Regulation: The Responsible Control of Drugs. This report examines in detail how governments can take control of currently illegal drug markets through responsible regulation, thereby weakening criminal organizations that now profit from them.\n\nThis new report provides a practical roadmap that tackles the real implications and recognizes the difficulties of transitioning from illegal to legally regulated drug markets. It offers concrete answers regarding the organizational capacity of state institutions to regulate and control a legal market of potentially dangerous products. It highlights the challenges facing impoverished populations that constitute the “working class” of the illegal drug markets. It offers possible ways forward to deal with the risks inherent to the resilience of organized crime. Finally, this report calls for a reform of the prohibition-based international drug control system, which is compromising a universal and holistic approach to the “drug problem”.\n\n"}
{"id": "43007580", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43007580", "title": "Gopala Gopala (2015 film)", "text": "Gopala Gopala (2015 film)\n\nGopala Gopala is an Indian 2015 Telugu devotional satirical drama film directed by Kishore Kumar Pardasani. The film was jointly produced by Daggubati Suresh Babu and Sharrath Marar under the Suresh Productions and North Star Entertainment banners. It features Pawan Kalyan and Venkatesh in the lead roles and Shriya Saran, Mithun Chakraborty and Posani Krishna Murali in supporting roles. Anoop Rubens composed the music while Jayanan Vincent was the film's cinematographer.\n\nThe film is a remake of the 2012 Hindi film \"OMG – Oh My God!\" which was itself based on the Gujarati stage play \"Kanji Viruddh Kanji\" and on the 2001 film \"The Man Who Sued God\". It follows the story of an atheist, Gopala Rao, who sues God after losing his shop in an earthquake. Religious organisations revolt against him and Bhaghvan Vishnu visits him as his human guide, under his incarnation Krishna.\n\n\"Gopala Gopala\" was made with a budget of 120 million. Production began on 9 June 2014. It was predominantly shot in and around Vishakhapatnam, with a few sections filmed in Hyderabad and Varanasi. The film was released worldwide on 10 January 2015 as a Sankranthi release. It received positive reviews from critics and grossed 660 million, with a distributor share of 411 million.\n\nKanneganti Gopala Rao is an atheist who owns a shop selling Hindu idols alongside his wife Meenakshi and son Moksha as well as his assistant Otthu. He obstructs a holy ritual involving his family, conducted by Siddheswar Maharaj, a fake godman. A sudden earthquake destroys his shop.\n\nRao approaches his insurance company who deny him assistance, claiming that an earthquake is an act of God. Rao decides to sue God but cannot find a lawyer willing to take the case on. He eventually engages Akbar Bhai, a disabled lawyer, who helps him file the case. Legal notices are sent to the insurance company as well as to Siddheshwar the priest and others from his group, as representatives of God. The court accepts the case, but Rao finds himself trapped among armed fundamentalists, with a creditor Ramji occupying the house and his wife having left him.\n\nRao is rescued by Gopala Govinda Hari, a consultant, who is revealed to the audience to be the deity Vishnu, under his incarnation Krishna in disguise. Gopala buys Rao's house from Ramji but allows Rao to stay with him. The lawsuit caused a public outcry, so on Gopala's advice, Rao gives an interview to the media about his views, which turns viral; public opinion swings in his favour. Hundreds of people whose insurance claims were rejected due to an Act of God clause turn up at Akbar's house and join the fight. Rao agrees to fight on behalf of all of them.\n\nIn the next court session, defending lawyer Shankar Narayana points out that Rao has no document that can prove the disaster was an Act of God. The judge orders Rao to present a written proof that will support his claim. Gopala gives Rao the Bhagavad Gita, Bible and Quran in which to find the answers. Rao subsequently points out a passage saying that \"This world is a creation of God, and it is his will to allow it to grow or destroy\", which strengthens his case. As he nears the end of his argument, he is stabbed by a staunch follower of Leeladhara.\n\nRao is rushed to the hospital where he slips into a coma due to heavy blood loss. Leeladhara then plans to make Rao a messenger of God and elevate him to a divine figure across the country after killing him. The lawsuit's verdict goes in Rao's favour and religious organisations are ordered by the court to pay the compensation to all the plaintiffs. After a month, Rao is rescued by Gopala, who later reveals his identity as Lord Vishnu by showing his Vishwaroopam. Rao starts to believe in the existence of God. Meanwhile, Leeladhara, Gopika Matha, and Siddheshwar open a temple dedicated to Rao and accumulate millions in donations. Rao learns that his death is planned for Vijayadashami which coincides with the death of Shirdi Sai Baba. He escapes with Gopala but is attacked by the priests' henchmen. Gopala manages to show them his 4th incarnation Lord Narasimha in place of Rao, scaring them off.\n\nRao arrives to find his statues erected at the place where his shop once stood. He wades through the stunned crowd and breaks the statue, then admonishes the crowd about trusting in godmen. He advises them to search for God inside themselves rather than worshipping statues. Rao prevents the crowd from attacking the priests, asking for them to be allowed to leave unharmed but also insisting that they stop believing in them. After the completion of Ramlila, Rao goes back to Gopala to thank him, only to find him gone.\n\nRao's family arrive and they are reunited. He sees Gopala's key chain on the floor. When he is about to take it back, he hears Gopala's voice telling him to get rid of it. He throws it away, seeing it disappear into the sky with a flash as Gopala \"signs off\", promising him they will meet again.\n\nIn early April 2013, the Paruchuri Brothers informed the media that they were in the final stages of acquiring the remake rights of Umesh Shukla \"OMG – Oh My God!\" (2012) and that work on the script would begin afterwards. It was also said that Ravi Teja would play the role of Krishna in this film, originally played by Akshay Kumar, and that the official confirmation of the film would come within a week. \"OMG – Oh My God!\" itself was an adaptation of the Gujarati play \"Kanji Viruddh Kanji\". Daggubati Suresh Babu acquired the remake rights in mid November 2013 and Daggubati Venkatesh was confirmed to be a part of the film's principal cast. Kishore Kumar Pardasani was selected to direct the film.\n\nAfter much speculation, Suresh Babu confirmed to the media in mid-February 2014 that Pawan Kalyan would play the role of Krishna and Sharrath Marar would be co-producing the film with North Star Entertainment. After considering the titles \"Deva Devam Bhaje\" and \"Gopala Gopala\", the latter was finalised just before its formal launch on 9 June 2014 at Hyderabad. Anoop Rubens was confirmed to replace Sohail Sen as the music director. Jayanan Vincent was selected to handle the cinematography, despite reports stating that P. C. Sreeram would be doing the job.\n\nVenkatesh and Rajendra Prasad were initially reported to reprise the roles of Akshay Kumar and Paresh Rawal from the original. Venkatesh was later confirmed as playing Paresh Rawal and Vikram was approached for the role of Krishna. Pawan Kalyan was engaged for the same part later on. Venkatesh personally researched and purchased his outfits., incorporating a number of differently-coloured short kurtas into his costume. He ended up with more than 40 changes onscreen.\n\nKalyan underwent a special diet and exercise to lose weight for the role in the film. Kishore Kumar said that Kalyan would be seen for 25 minutes, as in the original, but this was later extended to 45 minutes. Kalyan was slightly overweight before signing the film and followed a crash diet comprising milk and fruit, avoiding carbohydrates and oily foods. Reports stated that he would use a Hyosung GV650 Aquila Pro in the film. Later his team met Akshay Warde, who had designed a special Vardenchi motorcycle for Akshay Kumar in the original. Warde completed designing a new motorcycle within a month, albeit without a support team like he had had when making the original film.\n\nAfter considering Nayantara, Anjali, and Radhika Apte for the female lead, Shriya Saran was finalised for the role in early May 2014 after Nayantara walked out of the project citing scheduling and payment issues. She called her role a \"beautifully etched\" and an \"inspiring\" one. Saran added that the relationship between her and Venkatesh in the film would encapsulate the central debate of the existence of God. Mithun Chakraborthy was signed to repeat his role from the original in early June 2014, thereby making his Telugu debut. Posani Krishna Murali, Krishnudu, Raghu Babu, and Vennela Kishore were selected to play other important roles in the film. Madhu Shalini was selected to play the role of a journalist. It was originally unclear whose role she was remaking from the original when she was engaged on the film. Diksha Panth was selected to play the role that Poonam Jhawer performed in the original. Anisha Ambrose made a cameo appearance.\n\nIn early May 2014, the film's co-producer Sharrath Marar, in an interview with IANS, said that the regular shooting was planned to begin on 19 May 2014 after Pawan Kalyan was relieved from his political duties, also saying that the makers were aiming for a September 2014 release. However, it emerged that the film would be officially launched on 2 June 2014 and shooting would be done in a specially erected set in Hyderabad. Principal photography eventually commenced a week later on 9 June 2014 at Ramanaidu Studios at Nanakramguda in Hyderabad. Venkatesh joined the shoot in the same day. Pawan Kalyan allotted 25 days for the shooting of his scenes in the film.\nThe film's second schedule started on 18 July 2014 at Hyderabad after a brief break while Venkatesh was promoting his film \"Drushyam\". Pawan Kalyan was reported as joining the shoot on 23 July 2014 and a special sequence in which he would be seen driving his personal motorcycle was planned to be shot. His part in the film's dialogue was expected to be completed. However, Kalyan joined the sets two days in advance and scenes featuring him and Venkatesh were shot. The film's shoot continued in the outskirts of Hyderabad where scenes with Venkatesh. Kalyan and Shriya Saran were shot. The film's shoot continued in late August 2014 at Nanakramguda. The exteriors of Osmania University's College for Women in Koti, Hyderabad were used to shoot a court scene. Producer Daggubati Suresh Babu said that the college had a look which suited the scene.\n\nFilming went ahead in Ramoji Film City. Kalyan shot his introductory song in late September 2014. The filming was almost complete and in the middle of October 2014, the film's climax was shot in the outskirts of Hyderabad. An additional song with Venkatesh and Kalyan was also planned. At the end of October 2014, earthquake scenes were shot with Venkatesh and others at Ramoji Film City. Filming then continued in Nanakramguda. By then, three-quarters of the film's shoot was complete and Kalyan was reported as having completed shooting for his part during the subsequent weeks. Shooting for two songs and graphics work remained to be completed. By mid-November 2014, the film's shoot neared completion.\n\nVenkatesh and Shriya joined the film's sets in Vishakhapatnam where a song and a few more scenes were shot. On completion, the production team revealed that the schedule was shot in the city to boost morale at Ramanaidu Studios and also demonstrate to the Bengali and Oriya film industries that shoots could be carried out smoothly even after the destruction of the city by Cyclone Hudhud. The film continued to be shot near Varanasi in early December 2014, with Venkatesh and other actors taking part. A song with Venkatesh and Kalyan was shot in the outskirts of Hyderabad around the end of December. The final schedule began the next day and Kalyan's crucial scenes were planned.\n\nThe film is an official remake of the 2012 Hindi film \"OMG – Oh My God!\" directed by Umesh Shukla which tells the story of an atheist who sues God for causing an earthquake in which he loses his shop. The film focuses mostly on exploiting people's faith in the name of business and money-making. Daggubati Venkatesh said in an interview to \"The Hindu\" that this film would focus on the tensions between Indian rituals and spirituality. In the film, the deity involved, Krishna, teaches the atheist protagonist to use the principles of the Bhagavad Gita, Bible and Quran to win his case. A song introducing the atheist's character, his family and his views on rituals was added in which was not a part of the original.\n\nSeveral new scenes were included in the Telugu version, including two songs. The film also deals with the issue of fake godmen. Daggubati Venkatesh said in an interview with Suresh Kavirayani of the \"Deccan Chronicle, \"\"We all know about these people. Media also publishes stories about them all the time. We wanted to create some awareness among the people, so we touched on the theme of fake godmen. But there are genuine people too, who give wonderful messages and enlighten people with their preaching\". The lyrics of the song \"Enduko Enduko\" question the superstitions people believe in.\n\nDialogues written for and uttered by Kalyan's character in the film were linked to the politics of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Comments such as \"Nenu time ki Raavadam Kaadu Tammudu, Nenu Vachake time avutondi\" (\"I don't come on time; time starts when I come\") and \"Samardhulu Intlo undipothe Asamardhulu Rajyamelutaru\" (\"The unskilled will rule if the skilled stay at home\") appeared to refer to the change in government and Kalyan's own entry into politics.\n\nAnoop Rubens was signed in on to compose the film's soundtrack and score in June 2014. Before the official launch of the film, Rubens completed composing a song and was said by the makers to complete composing all the songs in a week's time from the launch. The soundtrack consisted of 4 songs whose lyrics were penned by Chandrabose, Sirivennela Sitaramasastri and Anantha Sreeram. Lahari Music acquired the soundtrack's marketing rights in mid August 2014. The soundtrack was released on 4 January 2015, and achieved high chart rankings.\n\nThe film was planned for release in either September or October 2014, but a January 2015 Sankranthi release was announced in July 2014. Gemini TV acquired the film's television broadcast rights in early December 2014. Suresh Babu sold the rights for an amount of as a three film package including \"Drushyam\" and \"Bhimavaram Bullodu\", both co-produced by him. The release date was confirmed as 9 January 2015. United States theatrical rights were acquired by BlueSky Cinemas Inc. The Central Board of Film Certification passed the film with a clean 'U' certificate and the release date was postponed to 10 January 2015. Because of the demand for the film's tickets, 20 more theatres were added to the original list.\n\nThe film was released in 1400 screens (1200 theatres) worldwide; 1100 theatres in India, out of which 850 theatres were in the AP/Nizam region, more than 100 theatres in United States and 50 theatres in the rest of the world. A charity performance was held at Shiva Parvathi theatre in Kukatpally, Hyderabad on 10 January 2015 at 2:30 AM. Photos featuring fans celebrating the film's release were widely circulated on Twitter.\n\nThe film's poster was unveiled on 28 November 2014, designed by Anil and Bhanu of AB Core Design. It began trending on social networking sites within few hours and became a worldwide trending topic. Anoop Rubens received acclaim for his background score in the poster. Another poster featuring Kalyan and Venkatesh on a motorcycle was unveiled on 16 December 2014. The theatrical trailer was unveiled on 4 December 2014 at the audio launch event. It began trending instantly on YouTube and within two days, it reached the first position in India's Top Trending videos on YouTube displacing \"Yennai Arindhaal...\" from first place with a view count of nearly 0.5 million.\n\nVishwa Hindu Parishad and Bhagyanagar Ganesh Utsav Samithi submitted an appeal to the regional director of Central Board of Film Certification on 31 December 2014 claiming that the film had objectionable scenes which hurt the religious sentiments of Hindu people. In a statement to IANS, they said that they had sought action before the release of the movie as any protest later would be futile. In an interview with Suhas Yellapuntala of \"The New Indian Express, \"Venkatesh said \"It’s natural for certain people to react and they are free to express their views but once they see the film they won’t look at it that way. In case, there are any unfortunate incidents, we will convince them and it’ll be fine. Because whatever the scriptures tell, that’s what I tell in the film\".\n\nRaghunadha Rao filed a similar case against the film at Saifabad police station on 10 January 2015. Telangana lawyers lodged a complaint with the law minister A. Indrakaran Reddy on 16 January 2015 and requested him to take immediate steps to delete objectionable scenes from the film. The division bench comprising Chief Justice Kalyan Jyoti Sengupta and Justice P. V. Sanjay Kumar of the Hyderabad High Court pointed out that it could not grant any order without making the producer and director of the film a party to the case. Raghunadha Rao then was permitted to file a fresh petition seeking a ban on the screening of the film.\n\nThe film received positive reviews from critics as well as audience according to \"International Business Times India\". Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of \"The Hindu\" wrote \"To a large extent, \"Gopala Gopala\" stays true to the essence of \"OMG – Oh My God!\" and it’s heart-warming to see a Telugu film backed by big stars taking up the idea of spirituality versus superstitious beliefs\". Veena N. of \"Oneindia Entertainment\" rated the film 4 out of 5 and stated \"Even though its a remake movie, \"Gopala Gopala\" is a must watch as it is a hilarious entertainer. Watch it for Power Star and Venkatesh\". Karthik Keramalu of \"IBN Live\" rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and wrote \"Like the recently-released Hindi film \"PK\", \"Gopala Gopala\" too challenges blind faith. Watching the two actors light up the screen, who, for many years have starred in successful remakes, is a nostalgic tribute. Pawan Kalyan with a charming smile confesses that dharma supports rightfulness; however, in no manner, does it mean to curb the will to criticize religion and its beliefs\".\n\nHemanth Kumar of \"The Times of India\" rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and wrote \"\"Gopala Gopala\" begins as a story about an atheist, who seems to offend a lot of people around him, and in the end, the film drives home the point that when you help others, it is as good as worshiping God himself. And in doing so, the film churns out plenty of thought provoking questions which force you to look for answers within yourself and this is perhaps the film's biggest achievement. The entire film turns out to be quite a gratifying experience if you play close attention to the dialogues and conversations between the lead characters, played by Venkatesh and Pawan Kalyan\". Suresh Kavirayani of the \"Deccan Chronicle\" rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and wrote \"In the second half, the film drags a bit, especially the swamijis’ scenes. The climax is also a bit boring. But, if you haven’t seen the original Paresh Rawal and Akshay Kumar starrer \"OMG — Oh My God!\", then you must watch \"Gopala Gopala\". Pawan Kalyan fans will love the film and it’s a treat for them with two big stars sharing screen space\".\n\nIn contrast, IANS rated the film 2.5 out of 5 and wrote \"It would've been nice if the core plot was retained and changes were made to the film and its characters. But you can't watch \"Gopala Gopala\" with such expectations because it successfully reproduces scenes and characters from the original as though remaking is misunderstood as copying frame-to-frame. One way it's commendable that the makers didn't try to make many changes since the remake features popular stars such as Daggubati and Pawan, who usually play to the gallery. But all this has been done at the cost of creativity and that's what makes the remake less exciting, if not boring.\"\n\nThe film earned a share of around 91.9 million on the opening day and emerged as the fourth highest opener of all time in the AP/Nizam areas. It stood in the fourth spot in the list of top ten opening day shares at the AP/Nizam box office behind \"Attarintiki Daredi\" (2013), \"Aagadu\" (2014) and \"Baadshah\" (2013). The film collected $0.6 million in two days at USA box office and was expected to cross the $1 million mark soon. The film collected a share of 40 million on its second day, taking its two-day AP/Nizam box office total to 135 million. With the inclusion of takings from Karnataka, Rest of India and overseas markets, the two-day worldwide box office collection was valued at 195 million. The film's trade witnessed a huge drop on its third day by collecting nearly 20 million at AP/Nizam Box office. But it topped the weekend box office followed by \"Tevar\" and \"Raghuvaran B. Tech\".\n\nIt also stood in the top spot at Chennai box office followed by \"PK\" and \"Kappal\". The film also took good openings in the United States where it collected 43.7 million in the weekend of 9–11 January 2015. The film collected 170 million in the first five days at AP/Nizam box office and 265 million at the worldwide box office. With this, it surpassed the opening weekend figures of \"Aagadu\" at AP/Nizam box office, but failed to surpass its worldwide three-day collections. The film collected a worldwide share of 298.5 million in six days surpassing the first week collections of \"Naayak\" (2013) and \"Ramayya Vasthavayya\" (2013). The six-day AP/Nizam area share was 230.8 million with which it surpassed the first week AP/Nizam share of \"Businessman\" (2012). According to \"The Times of India\", the film collected huge shares and headed towards record collections overseas, expected to cross 300 million mark.\n\nThe film collected 261.5 million at AP/Nizam box office and nearly 330 million at the worldwide box office in seven days and surpassed the first week collection of \"Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu\" (2013) at AP/Nizam box office and \"Baadshah\", \"Gabbar Singh\" (2012) at the worldwide box office. The film collected a gross of 590 million and a share of 379 million in nine days at the worldwide box office thus surpassing the lifetime collections of \"Pokiri\" (2006) and took the 18th spot in the list of all-time top 25 Telugu films with highest worldwide share. The film also created a new record in Mandapeta in East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh by collecting 2.08 million in nine days, breaking the record set by \"Magadheera\" (2009) in its lifetime run. The film witnessed a drop in its collections at AP/Nizam box office and earned around 310 million share in ten days. However the film crossed 400 million mark at the worldwide box office overtaking the totals of \"Businessman\" and \"Robo\", the Telugu dubbed version of \"Enthiran\" (2010). Due to stiff competition from \"I\", \"Pataas\" and \"Temper,\" the film collected a gross of 880 million and a distributor share of 411 million at the worldwide box office during its lifetime run. The film passed the 500 million gross mark and collected 335 million in its lifetime at the AP/Nizam box office alone.\n"}

Controlling the prices that landlords could make their tenants pay formed the main element of rent regulation, and was in place from 1915 until its abolition (excluding some council houses) by the Housing Act 1988.\n\nThere have been significant changes in attitudes and legislation toward the right to housing in mainland Britain. Concepts, such as rent control, 'security of tenure', statutory tenancy, regulated tenancy, fair rent, rent officer, Rent Officer Service and assured tenancy were introduced in the twentieth century, and have developed in the years since. It concerns the intervention of public law rights in private relations between landlord and tenant, and was put in place to counteract the inequality of bargaining power between landlords and tenants.\n\nRent control and security of tenure were first introduced on 23 December 1915 with the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (War Restrictions) Act 1915 and were intended to be temporary measures (due to expire six months after the end of the First World War) to deal with excessive increases in rents caused by the wartime housing shortage due to the cessation of building.\n\nThe Act attempted to remedy this evil by restricting the right of landlords to eject their tenants and prevented them from raising the rent except for limited purposes. At the same time, in fairness to the landlords, mortgagees of houses controlled by the Act were prevented from increasing the rate of interest and restricted in their rights to enforce the security. This was the first comprehensive European enactment controlling rent; since then many other Acts have been passed in Great Britain, and of course, in other European countries.\n\nBefore the 1915 Act, the relationship between landlord and tenant had been purely contractual; at the expiration or termination of the contract, the landlord could recover possession.\n\nThe new form of control was relatively simple and inflexible. The Act applied to separate dwellings with rateable values or standard rents not exceeding £35 in London, £30 in Scotland and £26 elsewhere.\n\nSpecifically excluded were:\n\nThe controlled rent was known as the standard rent. It was the rent of a letting on 3 August 1914; or, where there was no letting on that date, the rent the dwelling had last been let for before that date; or, in the case of a first letting after 3 August 1914, the rent at which it was first let.\n\nUnder the provisions of the Act, a tenant who paid the rent and observed other conditions of the tenancy, could only be evicted if the landlord could satisfy the Courts on certain grounds specified in the Act.\n\nThese were:\n\nIn addition, the Courts could grant possession on any other ground it considered satisfactory.\n\nAfter 25 November 1915, premiums were not allowed to be paid by a tenant on the grant, renewal or continuance of any tenancy. Any amount paid was recoverable unless it was made payable by an agreement entered into before 4 August 1914. (Leases for 21 years or more were later excluded by the Courts (Emergency Powers) Act 1917).\n\nThe Statement of Rates Act 1919 required any owner in England and Wales who received rent that included rates to show the amount in the rent book. The equivalent Scottish Act is the House Letting and Rating (Scotland) Act 1920.\n\nFurther extensions and amendments to the 1915 Act were made by the Acts of 1917, 1918 and two in 1919. Control was exempted from houses built alter 2 April 1919 or in process of construction at that date.\n\nRent control and security of tenure hardly proved to be such temporary measures as had been originally intended.\n\nFollowing the report of the Salisbury Committee into the continuing deterioration in the housing supply, the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act 1920 was passed, which consolidated and amended the earlier legislation. Most of the provisions were intended to be for a period of three years but they were successively extended and amended.\nAny remaining provisions were repealed and consolidated by the Rent Act 1968 and in Scotland by the Rent (Scotland) Act 1971. The 1920 Act is still the foundation of the modern law; most concepts of the Rent Acts are derived from it. It is suggested as a first source of reference for any original concepts which are not included in this brief summary.\n\nThe standard rent and rateable value limits were increased to £105 in London, £90 in Scotland and £78 elsewhere, and so applied to the great majority of let houses in the country. The concept of \"statutory tenant\" was introduced in this Act. Premises used for business, trade or professional purposes, or for the public service were brought within the Act for one year (with slightly different percentage increases to those outlined below for dwellings). New dwellings continued to be excluded from control.\n\nThe 1920 Act did not apply to houses erected, or in the course of erection, on 2 April 1919, nor to those that at that date or later were being reconstructed into two or more separate and self-contained flats or tenements.\n\nA measure of control was introduced for the first time to a furnished letting of a dwelling covered by the Act. This control related to abnormal or excessive profits. In the latter case, the landlord was liable to a fine of up to £100.\n\nThe Act allowed increases in rent of up to 40% and in mortgage interest of 1% (up to a maximum of six and one half per cent). The 40% was made up of two elements. An increase of 15% was allowed, to compensate the landlord for the fall in the value of money during the Great War. A further increase in rent of 25% was allowed to cover expenditure on repairs where the landlord did the repairs. This latter increase could not be levied on tenants of unfit dwellings or dwellings in disrepair. In fact, it could be levied but the tenant (or the sanitary authority) could go to court to have it suspended until the repairs had been carried out.\n\nIncreases were also permitted, as a percentage of the relevant expenditure, following improvement or structural alteration. A tenant of a furnished dwelling was able to go to the county court (in Scotland the Sheriff Court) for an order to freeze the rent at a specified level and for repayment of any rent already paid in excess of that level.\n\nThe Act now made it a penal offence, liable to a fine of £100, to require a premium, but reduced the length of excluded tenancies from 21 years or more to 14 years or more.\n\nDistress (in Scotland \"diligence\") could only be levied with consent of the court. Possession could be recovered if the court saw fit on a certain number of grounds, which were widened. The court lost its powers to grant possession on some unspecified but less satisfactory grounds.\n\nThere was a right of succession by the tenant’s widow if she was residing with him at his death or a member of the tenant’s family who had been residing with the tenant at the time of his death. A requirement for six months’ residence except for a widow was introduced by the 1933 Act.\n\nFollowing the report of the Onslow Committee, the Rent and Mortgage Interest Restrictions Act 1923 became the first measure to reverse the machinery of control.\n\nPremises came out of protection when tenants died or moved away. Sitting tenants remained controlled. The Acts ceased to apply to premises for which a lease or tenancy of not less than two years’ duration was granted to a sitting tenant. It extended the grounds for recovery of possession.\n\nAs has been said earlier, the 1915 Act had disapplied the Act where board, attendance, or furniture was provided. The 1923 Act now quantified the amount of attendance or provided furniture so that only substantial provision in rental terms would take the letting out of control. In other words, the value of attendance (personal services provided to the tenant) or the value of the furniture had to form a substantial part of the rental value.\n\nSubsequent legislation made minor amendments to previous enactments, and the Expiring Laws Continuance Acts 1927-1932 ensured continuity of the Rent Acts until 1933.\n\nThe recommendations of the Marley Committee in 1931 were implemented in the Rent and Mortgage Interest Restrictions (Amendment) Act 1933.\n\nThey had reported that the gradual decontrol inaugurated by the 1923 Act had worked satisfactorily with regard to the medium-sized houses, but too slowly to the largest and too quickly to the smallest. So the 1933 Act divided the dwellings the Acts applied to into three categories.\n\nThe larger houses became decontrolled where both the annual recoverable rent and the rateable value exceeded £45 in London and Scotland and £35 elsewhere.\n\nThe middle group comprised all existing controlled houses where the rateable value exceeded £20 in London £25 and 5 shillings in Scotland and £13 elsewhere. These became subject to decontrol by the 1923 Act when the landlord obtained vacant possession or granted a new minimum period two-year lease or tenancy.\n\nThe remaining controlled houses, the smallest houses, were those with rateable values not exceeding £20/£25.25/£13 as above. These could not become decontrolled piecemeal but were to remain controlled until the Rent Acts expired. If a house within these rateable value limits had become decontrolled under the 1923 Act it was not automatically brought back into control by the 1933 Act. It could remain decontrolled provided the landlord registered it as decontrolled within three months of the enactment of the 1933 Act.\n\nRents could be increased by a percentage of the relevant expenditure to reflect the provision of additional or improved fixtures or fittings made after enactment of the 1933 Act.\n\nA tenant of a dwelling that had become decontrolled by this Act had to be served one month’s notice that the possession would be required on the date specified in the notice unless a new tenancy had been negotiated before the notice ran out.\n\nSuccession\n\nAs has been mentioned above, the right of succession granted in the 1920 Act now required six months’ residence except for a widow. A widower could also succeed to the tenancy as a member of his deceased wife’s family provided that the six months’ test was satisfied.\n\nSuitable alternative accommodation\n\nThe Act also added new grounds for recovery of possession by a landlord (e.g. suitable alternative accommodation being available now became a sufficient ground for the recovery of possession).\nA second attempt (the first had been made in the 1919 Amendment Act) was made to prevent a tenant from charging an excessive rent on sub-letting part of the premises. Matters were certainly becoming more complicated.\n\nAfter yet another report, this one by Viscount Ridley’s Committee, the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act 1938 was introduced.\n\nThe 1938 Act automatically decontrolled all the more valuable houses in the middle value band (i.e., houses that exceeded £35 in London and Scotland and £20 elsewhere) and prevented any further creeping decontrol (introduced by the 1923 Act) of the lower range of houses in the middle-value band).\n\nThe 1938 Act did not reintroduce control of a house in the middle-value band that the 1933 Act had decontrolled, but the landlord had to get it registered as decontrolled within three months.\nFailure on the part of the landlord to meet the three-month deadline meant that the houses were deemed to be still controlled, unless the courts excused his failure to do so within one year from the passing of the Act.\n\nFor the first time, in defining the application of the Act, there was no reference to rent limits. Because rateable values were now the sole criterion for the continued applicability of the Acts, the result was decontrol of a large number of houses where the recoverable rent would have kept them in control.\n\nJust when it must have seemed that the end of control was in sight, the threat of war revived fears of the excessive rent increases that led to the initial introduction of control in 1915, the \"Rent and Mortgage Interest Restrictions Act 1939\" was introduced.\n\nAll dwellings not already subject to control, and with rateable values that did not exceed £100 in London, £90 in Scotland and £75 elsewhere were brought back into control.\n\nIt also brought to an end the creeping decontrol under the 1933 Act (whereby the landlord had been able to obtain vacant possession or decontrol had come about by the grant of a two-year lease or tenancy). The form of control introduced for the newly controlled dwellings differed from that previously in existence and they became \"new control\" and \"old control\" respectively. The distinction is no longer of importance, now that \"control\" has been replaced by \"regulation\". For the first time local authority dwellings were excluded from control.\n\nLike its First World War predecessor, the Second World War legislation was only intended to continue in force \"the principal Acts\" until six months after the emergency ended. These were the Rent And Mortgage Interest Restrictions Acts 1920 - 1938 and were due to expire in 1942. The Order in Council that should have declared the end of the emergency was never made, and the Acts, as amended, continued in force until 1968 (1971 in Scotland).\n\nln the aftermath of wartime bomb damage, shortage of materials and building restrictions, the increased demand for homes from those returning from the conflict resulted in housing shortages that continued into the next decade. No attempt was made to introduce any form of rent decontrol.\n\nThe Building Materials and Housing Act 1945, which was passed on 20 December 1945, limited selling and letting prices for certain houses.\n\nThe Act increased the amount of loan Treasury could raise under the \"Housing (Temporary Accommodation) Act 1944\" to £200M. Local authorities were enabled to grant loans to acquire or construct homes costing up to £1,500 each.\n\nA house or a flat constructed under building licence under the Defence Regulations made under the Emergency Powers (Defence) Acts 1939-1945 could be subject to a condition limiting the price for sale or rent (the \"permitted rent\").\n\nThe 1945 Act imposed a time limit of four years (subsequently raised in 1949 to eight years) during which a breach of the limit rendered the transgressor liable to a fine up to the aggregate of:-\na) the financial gain from the offence;\nb) a fine of £l00; or\nc) imprisonment for up to three months, or to both a fine and imprisonment.\n\nA second committee set up in 1943 under Viscount Ridley to review the working of the rent restriction Acts formed a very favourable opinion of the Rent of Furnished Houses Control (Scotland) Act 1943 and recommended that England and Wales should follow suit. The Furnished Houses (Rent Control) Act 1946 established a separate system of protection—modelled on Scottish legislation that involved rent tribunals setting reasonable rents—for contracts referred to them for furnished lettings. Previously these had not been subject to any effective control under the Rent Acts.\n\nInitially, the 1943 and 1946 Acts applied, irrespective of the dwelling’s rateable value or the rent. ln England and Wales, local authorities were required to keep registers of the rents so determined (registers were maintained by the tribunals themselves in Scotland).\n\nThis system was quite separate from the general rules as to control under the principal Acts.\n\nThe rent had to include payment for the use of furniture or for services (which included attendance and any other privilege such as the right to a cycle storage space). The provision of board (but only if it formed a substantial part of the rent) took the letting outside the jurisdiction of the Rent Tribunal.\n\nBoth the 1943 and 1946 Acts were temporary measures but were continued in force by successive Expiring Laws Continuation Acts. In 1974 the 1946 Act principles were re-deployed as the method of protecting the tenants of resident landlords. Both survive in the Rent Act 1977 and the Rent Act (Scotland) Act 1984.\n\nThe Landlord and Tenant (Rent Control) Act 1949 cured a number of defects in earlier Acts and empowered rent tribunals to determine, upon application to them by either the landlord or the tenant, a reasonable rent for any dwelling-house to which the Rent Acts applied, which was first let after 1 September 1939. The rent so determined became the standard rent.\n\nThis Act gave rent tribunals the power to suspend the operation of a notice to quit for a successive periods of up to three months at a time. It also debarred an application to a rent tribunal for an extension of security of tenure for a furnished letting where the tribunal, on an earlier reference, had given less than the maximum statutory period of security.\n\nThe 1949 Act also extended to all tenancies of dwelling-houses to which the Rent Acts applied, the penalties relating to the payment of premiums, and hidden premiums in consideration of leases of up to fourteen years\n\nIt applied the provisions of the 1943 and 1946 Acts to contracts, for both furnished and unfurnished lettings, under which the tenant shared some living accommodation with the landlord. Where the tenant shared some living accommodation with persons other than the landlord, it applied the Rent Acts to the contract.\n\nThe Reserve and Auxiliary Forces (Protection of Civil Interests) Act 1951 conferred on servicemen the same protection as that provided under the Rent Acts in cases where their tenancies were not already within those Acts.\n\nIncidentally, this Act has been amended on several successive occasions whenever there has been an amendment to the protection given by the Rent Acts to ensure that servicemen would have a rented home to return to.\n\nThe Crown Lessees (Protection of Sub-Tenants) Act 1952 brought within the Rent Acts tenants, lessees and mortgagors of Crown property, except where the Crown was the immediate landlord, lessor or mortgagee.\n\nThe Accommodation Agencies Act 1953 prohibited the taking of money from a prospective tenant simply by registering his name and requirements and prevented the making of charges simply for supplying the addresses of accommodation available to let. Local authorities in England and Wales were given power to prosecute in the magistrates’ court.\n\nThe Housing Repairs and Rents Act 1954 sought to encourage landlords to repair controlled houses by allowing a \"repairs increase\" in the rent for houses brought into. and maintained in, good repair. It also sought to encourage the building and conversion of houses for letting to tenants by excluding from control all dwelling-houses built after 30 August 1954 and all separate, self-contained dwellings produced by conversion after that date, except in cases that had attracted improvement grants.\n\nRent tribunals were empowered to fix, upon application, an appropriate increase in the rent for increases in the cost of providing services in pre 1939 Act controlled tenancies.\nAll tenancies owned by local authorities, development corporations and housing associations and trusts were excluded from the application of the Rent Acts.\n\nThe passing on to the tenant of rates increases and limited increases in rent attributable to improvements or structural alterations carried out by the landlord to a dwelling had been permitted since the inception of the Rent Acts. The 1954 Act permitted specified increases for dwelling-houses that were kept in good repair by the landlord, but limited the total rent recoverable to twice the gross value of the dwelling-house.\n\nIt removed the ban on premiums in the case of the assignment of leases granted for periods exceeding 21 years, it relaxed the rules if a premium was paid on the grant, continuance, renewal or assignment of a tenancy if it consisted of reasonable expenditure on alterations or improvements, or a reasonable amount for goodwill.\n\nPart l of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 extended Rent Act protection to tenants under long leases at low rents, and to the sub-tenants of tenants under such leases, by providing a procedure that converted those tenants into statutory tenants on the expiry of their tenancies.\n\nThe Requisitioned Houses and Housing (Amendment) Act 1955 released from requisition those houses where the licensed occupier was accepted by the owner as a statutory tenant. The owner of the house was compensated for giving up the right to possession.\n\nPassed only after several particularly severe smoke-polluted fogs (called \"smog\") in London and the industrial towns had caused health problems, the Clean Air Act 1956 (which applied north and south of the border) reimbursed expenditure spent on the adaptation of fireplaces to burn smokeless fuel. The work counted as an improvement for rent increase purposes under the Rent Act 1957. Eight percent of the cost (net of any reimbursement) could be added to the rent.\n\nThe new Conservative government passed the Rent Act 1957 which decontrolled all the more valuable houses and reintroduced a system of gradual decontrol in a revised form. lt also transformed the method of fixing the maximum rent payable by tenants by introducing a formula based upon rateable value.\n\nComing into effect on 6 July, the 1957 Act immediately decontrolled all dwelling houses and all contracts for furnished lettings of dwelling houses, with rateable values on 7 November 1956 exceeding £40 in the Metropolitan Police District or the City of London and Scotland, and £30 elsewhere in England and Wales; and tenancies granted for a period exceeding 21 years.\nNo new tenancies were to be subject to control, whatever the rateable value of the premises, unless granted to a tenant who was immediately before its creation a controlled tenant of the same premises or premises that included them.\n\nPremiums and payments of rent in advance were forbidden to be charged to tenants of premises that had become decontrolled by the Act for a period of three years from the commencement of the Act. A minimum of four weeks’ notice to quit was introduced and the Act enabled the exchange of controlled tenancies by agreement of all parties concerned, without loss of security or rent control, The Act used the word \"exchange\" although \"transfer\" would have been more apt.\n\nThe \"standard rent\" was replaced with a new \"rent limit\" calculated by multiplying the 1956 Gross Value by a factor determined according to the repairing liabilities of the parties. For instance, where the landlord was responsible for all repairs and external decoration, (the tenant being responsible for internal decoration only) the 1956 Gross Value would be multiplied by two to produce the annual rent limit. Other multipliers were to be used for different repairing and decorating liabilities.\n\nThe \"rent limit\" could be increased for rates borne by the landlord and by a reasonable charge for the provision of any furniture or services. The limit was subject to periodic adjustment to take account of changes in the amount of the rates, changes in the provision of furniture or services and for improvements.\n\nIt could be reduced when the dwelling became in disrepair. Eight per cent of the net cost of any improvement (i.e. after deducting the amount of any grant received by the landlord) for works completed after 5 July 1957 could be added to the rent.\n\nThe Act gave the Minister power for future rent control by order requiring the affirmative resolution of each House of Parliament.\n\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s there were many newspaper reports of landlords victimising their (controlled) tenants to force them out of their homes. The new word \"Rachmanism\" (after Peter Rachman, a property owner who was alleged to be responsible for many of these cruel activities) was introduced into the language.\n\nThe Landlord and Tenant (Temporary Provisions) Act 1958 prohibited the recovery of possession except by legal proceedings of certain dwelling houses released from control by Section 11(1) of the Rent Act 1957. It also suspended for a limited period the execution of any order made for possession for those still remaining in their homes on 1 August 1958, by postponing the effect of any earlier order for possession. lt regulated the rent payable pending recovery of possession (to twice the 1956 gross value, plus rates, and for services and furniture unless the contractual rent previously payable was higher). It made it an offence to recover possession other than by proceedings in court and to withhold services or furniture to which the tenant was entitled.\n\nCertain grounds were provided whereby a landlord could try to satisfy the court that an order for possession should subsequently be granted.\n\nThe Landlord and Tenant (Furniture and Fittings) Act 1959, which came into force on 29 July 1959 prohibited landlords from requiring excessive payments for furniture, fittings, and other articles as a condition of the grant, renewal, continuance, or assignment of tenancies of dwellings. Such payments were an attempt to find a way round the prohibition to require a premium in the \"Landlord and Tenant (Rent Control) Act 1949.\"\n\nOffenders attempting to obtain from prospective tenants excessive amounts for furniture and fittings were liable to be punished by a fine not exceeding £l00. Local authorities were given powers to inspect dwellings where they suspected an offence had been committed.\n\nPrivate street works made under the Highways Act 1959, which updated earlier provisions in the Public Health Act 1875 and the Private Street Works Act 1892 counted as improvements. Their net cost were included in the calculation of rent increases.\n\nThe effect of the neglect of repairing liabilities during and after the Second World War faced many tenants on short leases with huge bills for dilapidations to make good dwellings which had been originally let in a poor state of repair. Such tenants did not at that time have sufficient security of tenure to enable them to reap the benefit from carrying out major repairs.\nUnder the Housing Act 1961 (see particularly sections 32 and 33) where a tenancy of a dwelling house for less than seven years was granted after 24 October 1961, the landlord was required by an implied covenant to keep in repair the structure and interior (including drains, gutters and external pipes) and to keep in repair and proper working order the installations in the house for the supply of water, gas and electricity, for sanitation, and for space heating and heating water. This applied whatever the rent or the rateable value. The Act included a provision to prohibit the backdating of a lease. The term of years counted from the date of lease signing.\n\nThe 1961 Act increased the percentage addition to the rent for the net cost of improvement works carried out after 24 November 1961, from eight per cent (as it had been in the Rent Act 1957) to twelve and one half per cent.\n\nThe Landlord and Tenant Act 1962 required landlords to provide rent books for tenancies when rent was payable weekly (except where board represented a substantial part of the rent). This Act had a more general application than the 1938 Act, and consolidated certain requirements from the 1933 Act and the 1957 Act. Information to include was prescribed, and the tenant was given the right to obtain information, particularly when the landlord was a company. The penalty for an offence was a fine not exceeding £50 (or £100 for a second conviction).\n\nThe Housing Act 1964 set up the Housing Corporation to assist housing associations to provide housing accommodation in England, Wales and Scotland. It authorised the Scottish Special Housing Association to act on behalf of the Housing Corporation in Scotland.\n\nThe 1964 Act conferred on local authorities the duty to compel the improvement of dwellings that were without standard amenities and amended improvement grant legislation to provide improvement grants and standard grants. The standard amenities were:\n\n\nThe Protection from Eviction Act 1964 of 17 December 1964 was an interim measure intended to run to the end of 1965 and then expire. This to give time for an overhaul of the legislation.\n\nIt restricted the eviction of residential occupiers from their homes. Widows and widowers and members of the family living with the residential occupier at the date of death were also covered. Agricultural service occupiers were treated as tenants for 1964 Act purposes.\n\nIt became unlawful to evict other than by proceedings in the county court or to withdraw or withhold services or furniture. On summary conviction, the offender was liable to a fine of £100 or six months’ imprisonment, or both.\n\nThese new offences of illegal eviction and harassment were soon to be absorbed into the Rent Act 1965 and eventually to be transferred into the Protection from Eviction Act 1977.\n\nThe courts could suspend recent possession orders, could suspend the execution of an order for possession for up to twelve months and could impose certain conditions and terms.\n\nThere were a few exceptions (e.g., tenancies the following Acts applied to: Small Landholders (Scotland) Acts 1886-1931, Tenancy of Shops (Scotland) Act 1949, Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 1949, Crofters (Scotland) Acts 1955-1961). Nothing affected the operation of the Small Tenements Recovery Act 1838 (which included brothels and premises acquired for defence purposes) or the Pluralities Act 1838 or the Lecturers and Parish Clerks Act 1844 (ecclesiastical property).\nIt postponed until the end of March 1966 the decontrol of dwellings requisitioned during the war.\n\nThe Labour Government elected in 1964 had pledged to repeal the 1957 Rent Act. lt was clearly impossible to re-impose rent control in a simple way. A Committee on Housing in Greater London under the chairmanship of Sir Milner Holland, QC, reported in March 1965. They found that there was \"an acute shortage of rented housing in London and many difficulties and hardships arising from it\". This was not a situation peculiar to London. They observed that neither rigid control nor piecemeal and haphazard decontrol could relieve the situation and that any new system of control (or regulation) should provide that rents in future should be subject to periodic review.\n\nIn this situation and in these circumstances came a new piece of legislation that was a major turning point. Richard Crossman, Lord Goodman, who became President of the Institute of Rent Officers and others claimed paternity rights.\n\nThe Rent Act 1965 introduced the Rent Officer Service. The Ministry of Housing and Local Government, which later became part of the Department of the Environment, and then Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, was responsible for setting up the administrative arrangements and the appointment of the first Rent Officers, in England and Wales. Appointments were made by the \"proper officer\" a designated official in each local authority (usually the chief executive or senior legal executive of the county council or of each London borough who was responsible for providing accommodation, for supervision and disciplinary matters. The service was funded from central government by grant claims.\n\nIn practice these matters were delegated to a Senior Rent Officer in each of the seventy-seven original registration area offices. Decisions made by individual Rent Officers were considered as to be made independently. The system was devised so that Rent Officer’s decisions could not be influenced by local or central government. Administrative staff were appointed who were employed by the local authority.\n\nThe first Rent Officer appointments were made in the City of Westminster where Rent Officers appointed in other registration areas were trained. Early appointments were made from the legal profession, from the Inland Revenue valuation office, former estate agents, property managers, and retired ex-military and retired ex-policemen. The first rent registration was made on a flat above a fishmongers shop in Paddington Street, Marylebone, London W1.\n\nThe Institute of Rent Officers (IRO) was formed to promote a professional approach and to carry out education and training. The Journal of the Institute of Rent Officers JIRO was published quarterly to encourage discussion of procedures, valuation practice and to provide information about new legislation and \"case law\" arising from legal decisions in the Courts relating to landlord and tenant matters.\n\nThe Educational Trust of the Institute of Rent Officers published guides and a brown-coloured Manual of Rent Regulation which provided practitioners with annotated amendments as complete reprinted pages to residential landlord and tenant legislation in loose-leaf form. This important and prompt updating service incorporated the many amendments noted in this guide. The brown manual could often be seen on the bench of high court judges and in the hands of solicitors and barristers representing landlords and tenants in the courts.\n\nThe 1965 Act brought within protection most houses that were decontrolled by the 1957 Act, and newer houses that had never been controlled (i.e., newly erected or produced by conversion after 30 August 1954). It gave security to tenancies of most dwelling houses with rateable values of up to £400 in Greater London and £200 elsewhere not already controlled. The 1965 Act cleverly began by stating that a tenancy under which a dwelling house (which could be a house or part of a house) was let as a separate dwelling was a protected tenancy.\n\nThere were certain exceptions (which were modified and added to in subsequent legislation). References are those in Part I of the later consolidated Rent Act 1977:\n\nThe Rent Act 1965 introduced three major innovations. Firstly, except for furnished lettings, it was the first time that a new long-term flexible approach had been brought to the old problem of rent control. It substituted the rent-fixing formula of earlier legislation with independent rent regulation by Rent Officers. This introduced the normal valuation principles into the assessment of a fair rent (section 68 in the Rent Act 1965 and Section 70 in the consolidated Rent Act 1977) by requiring that regard should specifically be had to the age, character, locality and state of repair of the dwelling. Personal circumstances were to be disregarded as were improvements carried out voluntarily by, and any disrepair or defects attributable to, the tenant or a predecessor in title. A most fundamental concept was introduced whereby it had to be assumed that the number of persons seeking to become tenants of similar dwelling houses in the locality on the terms (other than those relating to rent) of the regulated tenancy was not substantially greater than the number of such dwelling-houses in the locality that were available for letting on such terms. This requirement to assume a roughly balanced market was described by commentators as the \"scarcity factor\", (words that did not appear in the Act). There was an automatic rent review (but only if applied for) at three-yearly intervals (reduced to two-yearly intervals in the 1980 Housing Act).\n\nSecondly, it instituted rent registration, schemes for the appointment of Rent Officers and a nationwide Rent Officer Service. Rent Officers were required, in accordance with specified procedures, upon application to determine and register fair rents. Objections to the rents determined by Rent Officers by either landlords or tenants were to be passed to a network of rent assessment committees with appellate jurisdiction. Rent Officers appointed as \"statutory officers\" therefore had a quasi-judicial function. As a tribunal of first instance they had the same duty as the former furnished rent tribunals to determine their own jurisdiction to act upon an application. Appeals against such decisions as to jurisdiction were to be considered by the County Court.\n\nThirdly, the Act made it an offence for any person unlawfully (i.e. without a court order) to evict a tenant or to harass with the intention of persuading the tenant to move out or to forego any rights in respect of the premises. The offences applied irrespective of the dwelling’s rateable value and service occupiers and other licensees whose licence was still in existence were also protected.\n\nThe percentage increase of the net cost to be added to the rent for improvements carried out after 8 December 1965 and after the rent had been agreed, was twelve and one half per cent.\n\nThe right of succession to a statutory tenancy was extended to enable the tenancy to be transmitted to a second successor on the same rules applicable to the transmission on the death of the original tenant or of the first successor.\n\nThe 1965 Act also raised to £400 in Greater London and £200 elsewhere the rateable value limits of furnished houses within the jurisdiction of rent tribunals and extended the maximum period by which they could delay the operation of a notice to quit to six months. The presidents of rent assessment panels in England and Wales were empowered to make appointments to Rent Tribunals in their areas.\n\nThe 1965 Act provided for the conversion of statutory tenancies subsisting under the provisions of the Requisitioned Houses and Housing (Amendment) Act 1955 by extending its time limit for this purpose. This finally tidied up one of the remaining consequences of the wartime emergency. The Airports Authority Act 1965 added the net cost of soundproofing works to the list of improvements that could increase rents.\n\nThe Agriculture Act 1967 contained provisions relating to the letting and recovery of farm houses that became redundant following the amalgamation of farms under that Act.\n\nThe Leasehold Reform Act 1967 brought back into the Acts long tenancies (a tenancy granted for a term of years certain exceeding twenty-one years) (other than those at a low rent), but unintentionally applied to them the Rent Act inhibitions upon premiums.\n\nThe Caravan Sites Act 1968 made it unlawful, without the sanction of the courts, to deprive a person who occupied a caravan as a residence, whether owned or rented, on a caravan pitch that was protected (one that required a site licence under the 1960 Caravan Sites and Development Act). The 1968 Act gave courts the power to suspend possession orders up to twelve months and protected caravan occupiers against harassment. Local authorities had power to prosecute. Harassment and illegal eviction was punishable by a fine of £100 for the first offence and £500 and six months imprisonment (or both) for a second offence.\n\nWith the exception of section 16 of the 1957 Act (notices to quit) and Part III of the 1965 Act (illegal eviction and harassment), the Rent Act 1968 consolidated all the earlier Rent Acts; the Furnished Houses (Rent Control) Act 1946, the Landlord and Tenant (Rent Control) Act 1949, Part II of the Housing Repairs and Rent Act 1954 and other related enactments (some twenty-four in all), without rationalising or simplifying them.\n\nThe 1965 Act had previously provided the power by Ministerial Order for the progressive conversion of existing controlled tenancies to regulated tenancies. This power was never exercised and the Housing Act 1969 introduced a phased programme of conversion, determined by rateable values, and the qualification certificate procedure outlined below, for those controlled tenancies in good repair and equipped with standard amenities.\n\nGrants became available to provide dwellings by conversion or for improvements of existing dwellings and there were special grants for houses in multiple occupation. Grants to provide standard amenities were specified (e.g. £30 for a bath or shower; £50 for a water closet and £30 for a hot and cold water supply at a sink) The term \"improvements\" included the replacement of an existing fixture or fitting.\n\nQualification certificates could be issued by a local authority for premises that had all the standard amenities and were in good repair. A certificate of fair rent issued by the Rent Officer stated what the fair rent would be once any missing standard amenities had been provided. A fair rent could then be determined (the application was supported by the certificate of fair rent) but the increase in rent was phased over a period of four years (two years if the work had been aided by an improvement grant). Amount attributable to services Rent Officers had previously informally shown an amount for the value of services on the register. The 1969 Act required there to be a note on the rent register of the amount attributable to the provision of services (but not if the charge for the services was variable). A note was now also required of the increase over the amount for services in the previous rent (which could be calculated by apportionment if necessary). This amount affected the phasing calculation.\n\nThe Act introduced a new definition of a house in multiple occupation (HMO) and provided for registers and orders applying a management code. Powers were given to local authorities to close an HMO (or part of it) if it was not possible to provide a fire escape. It introduced the possibility of control orders to be followed by compulsory purchase orders. Directions were made to avoid or reduce overcrowding.\n\nIn determining whether a long tenancy was a tenancy at a low rent, the sums payable by the tenant in respect of rates, services, repairs, maintenance or insurance now had to be disregarded.\n\nThe Act removed most of the unintended consequences of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 in respect of premiums and the price to be paid for enfranchisement. Increased rents registered between 10 July 1968 and 31 December 1969 were liable to phasing under the Prices and Incomes Regulations 1968 (which only applied until the end of 1969). When those regulations expired, the Rent (Control of Increases) Act 1969 (which only applied to the end of 1971) introduced phasing of rent increases generally speaking over three equal annual increments.\n\nImprovements to the security of tenure available to occupants of agricultural tied cottages were made by the Agriculture Act 1970. It amended Section 33 of the Rent Act 1965 to ensure that, subject to conditions, the tenant of a tied cottage, or his widow, would automatically get at least six months’ security of tenure alter the employment ended. This Act extended the provisions of the Agriculture Act 1967 to Q redundant farm houses and not only just those redundant due to amalgamation of farms under the 1967 Act.\n\nThe Fire Precautions Act 1971 made amendments to the Rent Act 1968 and arrangements to amend the Rent (Scotland) Act 1971. Where a dwelling was subject to a controlled or a regulated tenancy and the dwelling was issued with a fire certificate, the amount of the expenditure (or a proportion of it approved by the county court) incurred in fire precautions work was to be considered as an improvement in an application for a certificate of fair rent. The county court could, upon application, determine an increase in the rent of controlled or regulated tenancies due to the cost of carrying out fire precaution works.\n\nA review under the chairmanship of Hugh Francis QC was commissioned in October 1969 to review the operation of rent regulation under the Rent Acts, especially in large centres of population where accommodation was scarce, and to consider the relationship between the furnished and unfurnished codes.\n\nIts conclusion, published on 2 March 1971, was that rent regulation was working well. The report made 36 recommendations, four of which were enacted in the Housing Finance Act 1972, an Act that in its time had a minor claim to fame—57 committee sittings taking 248 hours of debate in the House of Commons, which, it was suggested, justified a place in the Guinness Book of Records.\n\nThe 1972 Act introduced many new concepts:\n\nPreviously, rent rebates had been introduced on a discretionary basis (in Scotland by the Housing (Scotland) Act 1966), which had led to haphazard, piecemeal and inconsistent implementation.\n\nThe Housing Finance Act 1972 also brought fundamental changes to rent legislation. It became the duty of every local authority and new town corporation to determine a fair rent (on the same basis and definition as a fair rent for regulated tenancies) for every one of their housing revenue account dwellings. This was to be done by making provisional assessments of fair rents for their properties. These assessments had to be submitted to a rent scrutiny board that could confirm them or substitute different rents. These provisions were repealed in 1976. Dwellings owned by housing associations and housing trusts (usually charities), which were registered with the Housing Corporation (but not those that were registered societies under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965) were brought within the fair rent system. From 1 January 1973, their rents were to be determined by Rent Officers and registered in a separate part of the Rent Register. New subsidies were introduced for housing associations and housing trusts registered with the Housing Corporation.\n\nFor the first time, tenants were entitled to information about the cost of services provided by landlords when the cost exceeded £80. Local authorities, other public sector landlords (including housing associations) and management companies run by their tenants were excepted. A failure to provide information became a criminal offence.\nThe Rent Assessment Committee (England and Wales) Regulations 1971 was the first of many Statutory Instruments that regulated procedures to follow when dealing with appeals against Rent Officer decisions.\n\nOrders made under the Counter Inflation (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972 froze rents at their level on 6 November 1972 (as well as prices and wages) as part of the government’s counter inflation measures. The freeze lasted initially for 90 days and was extended to 150 days by a later Order. Conversions from controlled to regulated tenancies (and in general, increases in rents of housing association tenancies) were postponed until the end of the standstill period.\nThe freeze applied to all private residential tenancies including those with rateable values above the Rent Act limits.\nThe Counter-Inflation Act 1973 imposed a further freeze from March 1974 (until March 1975 in England and Wales) (until May 1975 in Scotland).\n\nThe Furnished Lettings (Rent Allowances) Act 1973 extended the rent allowance scheme to furnished lettings (those contracts within Part VI Rent Act 1968) and for certain housing authority furnished lettings, except where the landlord was the Crown or where substantial board was provided.\n\nOwing to the increased pressure of demand for housing resulting in increased house prices by a continuing trend during 1971 and 1972, a Conservative government by the Counter-Inflation Act 1973 extended the scope of Rent Act protection of the higher rated accommodation horn 23 March 1973. The rateable value limits were raised from £400 to £600 in London and from £200 to £400 elsewhere for those properties appearing in the 1963 valuation list. Those limits were raised to £1,500 in London and to £750 elsewhere from 1 April 1973 to take account of the revised valuation list that took effect on that date. It was estimated that this brought a further 16,000 tenancies into protection. Luxury blocks of flats with extensive porterage and services were swept into control and even in Central London only a few very large individual houses in Regent's Park were found to be outside the scope of Rent Act protection.\nThe rateable value limits for Rent Act protection were not changed for Scotland.\n\nThree important Acts were passed in the next two years rather surprisingly by a Conservative administration. The Rent Act 1974 brought full protection to those existing furnished lettings where the landlord was not resident in the same premises. Previously they had had only limited protection under the 1943, 1946 and 1949 Acts. The concept of \"resident landlord\" was entirely new. For all new tenancies created on or after 14 August 1974, whether furnished or unfurnished, the factor to decide their protection was to be the residency or non-residency of the landlord.\n\nThe Housing Act 1974 gave many private tenants the right to additional information as to the identity of their landlord, and there was also a new duty to inform a tenant of a dwelling of the assignment of a landlord’s interest. It extended the right to information about service charges and introduced the right to challenge them. The form and content of certain notices to quit was to be prescribed by regulations to be made by the Secretary of State and the improvement grant system was re-vamped. Housing action areas, general improvement areas and priority neighbourhoods were introduced.\n\nGrants for the provision of standard amenities, improvements (which were compulsory in some cases) and for the repair of dwellings were introduced. The Act also extended the powers of the Housing Corporation with regard to housing associations and amended the system of providing financial assistance to them.\n\nThe Housing Rents and Subsidies Act 1975 repealed the provisions of the Housing Finance Act 1972 in relation to public sector dwellings and by and large gave local authorities a free hand in determining their rent policies. The gradual decontrol process based on rateable values was stopped, and a system of phased rent increases was introduced for all tenancies. Apart from the temporary provisions in the counter-inflation legislation in 1972 and 1973, mentioned earlier, there had been previously no phasing of increases of rent following re-registration of a fair rent.\n\nThese phasing arrangements required a careful scrutiny of the cost of providing services and assessment of the value of services. The Social Security (Consequential Provisions) Act 1992 required the amount attributable to services to be noted on the Rent Register to assist the assessment of housing benefit.\n\nNew amenities or improvements to a locality that were not provided at the landlords expense were to be disregarded in determination of a fair rent—and by a very late amendment, any deterioration in a locality that was not the fault of the landlord were to be disregarded. Semantics came into the valuation process. Fortunately these disregards were subsequently repealed.\n\nSome agricultural workers, forestry workers and members of their families had enjoyed security of occupation under the Rent Acts. The Rent (Agriculture) Act 1976 conferred on occupiers of \"tied cottages\" protection similar to that enjoyed by Rent Act statutory tenants. Rents became eligible for registration under the fair rent system and such decisions kept in a separate part of the Rent Register.\n\nIn 1977 previous legislation (except the Rent (Agriculture) Act 1976 was consolidated into the Rent Act 1977 (which embodied the \"temporary\" counter inflation device of phasing) and the Protection from Eviction Act 1977 (which contained special provisions in respect of agricultural workers) consolidated the provisions of previous Rent Acts (chiefly the Acts of 1957 and 1965), which protected all residential occupiers from eviction without due process of law.\n\n\"Sitting tenant\" is not used in the legislation but is in general use to mean anyone who has a tenancy protected by legislation. These are usually considered to be long term tenants. A \"fair rent\" is a rent registered under the Rent Act 1977. A \"Controlled tenancy\" is a tenancy created before 1957. A \"Regulated tenancy\" is one created after 1965 that is regulated now by the Rent Act 1977 and for which a rent can be registered by the Rent Officer (sometimes called a \"Fair Rent Officer\"). A \"Protected tenant\" is someone who has a tenancy protected by the Rent Acts. This can either be a \"Contractual tenancy\" during the term of a lease (contract) or tenancy agreement. When this contract expires the tenancy becomes a \"Statutory tenancy\" in which the tenant \"holds over\" under the protection of the statutes (Rent Acts) on the same terms as the original contract (in so far as they are not overtaken by statute). It might be obvious but it is worth just repeating that a protected tenant with security of tenure is not much use if the rent cannot be controlled. A fair rent is not much use unless the tenant has protection from eviction.\n\nThe Housing Act 1980 made various amendments to the Rent Act 1977 that changed procedures for rent registration. The rent registration review period was reduced from three to two years. The periods of phasing of increases were consequently quickened. Following the referral of a decision to a Rent Assessment Committee the two-year period was made to run from the date of their decision rather than the original effective date. Registered rents were made effective from the date of registration rather than the date of the application. In those cases when the registration was made before the expiration of the two-year period, the registration took effect from the day following the expiry of the two-year period. The Act made changes to the procedures for the need for Rent Officers to call consultations in certain circumstances. The Act also made changes to the requirements necessary before a registration could be cancelled. The original registration had to be at least two years old. The landlord alone could make an application if the premises were no longer let on a regulated tenancy.\n\nA new mandatory ground for possession (Case 20) was introduced for lettings by servicemen. Changes were made to the mandatory grounds for possession for lettings by former owner occupiers and those who own homes intended for retirement, which covered circumstances that could not have been foreseen at the time of the letting.\n\nRent Tribunals were abolished. Their functions, except for the power to grant security of tenure, were transferred to rent assessment committees. A more limited discretion to award security of tenure (a maximum of three months) was given to the county court, as part of the possession order proceedings.\n\nAny remaining controlled tenancies were converted to regulated tenancies.\n\nNew protected shorthold tenancies were created that protected during the contractual term of a short fixed-term letting. A rent had to be registered at the time the tenancy was granted or a certificate of fair rent obtained before then and a registration made within twenty-eight days of the commencement of the tenancy. This requirement was removed for all registration areas outside Greater London by the Protected Shorthold Tenancies (Rent Registration) Order 1981 and for registration areas in Greater London by a similar order in 1987.\n\nAssured tenancies were created that gave certain approved bodies the right to create assured tenancies of new dwellings outside Rent Act protection at market rents. These tenancies were subject to the provisions of Part II of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954.\n\nAdditional protection was given to council tenants and many housing association tenants, who were to be known as secure tenants.\n\nCouncil tenants were granted the right to buy their homes.\n\nPersonal representatives of deceased resident landlords were given a period of two years (instead of the one year under the 1974 Act) during which they had freedom to evict. The Act qualified the description of accommodations so that a tenancy of part of a flat in a purpose-built block occupied by a resident landlord could not be subject to a protected tenancy, an unintended effect of the wording in the Rent Act 1974.\n\nHousing Associations registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965 might now be registered with the Housing Corporation even if their objectives were to acquire, repair, improve or convert houses for eventual disposal by sale as well as by lease.\nPrior to the 1980 Act, housing associations had to keep their houses available for letting and were therefore prohibited from selling them. Housing associations were now enabled to build or to improve property or to put existing properties up for sale into shared ownership.\n\nProtection could now extend to previously protected tenancies—those that belonged to Her Majesty in right of the Crown, if managed by the Crown Estate Commissioners (largely in the right of the Duchy of Lancaster, tenancies that belong to the Duchy of Cornwall), statutory tenancies under the Rent (Agriculture) Act 1976 and long leaseholds at low rents (Part I Landlord and Tenant Act 1954). (Tenants of the Crown direct and of government departments (which includes tenants of a Health Service Body) remain outside protection).\n\nShared ownership leases were not to be treated as long tenancies at a low rent for the purposes of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967. Rent Officers were asked to determine fair rents on a non-statutory basis for shared ownership properties. Initial enthusiasm was tempered when questions of some difficulty arose in the assessment of a fair rent relating to equity stakes and premiums. These were dealt with later in the Housing and Planning Act 1986.\nThe Matrimonial Homes Act 1983 consolidated certain enactments relating to the rights of a husband or wife to occupy a dwelling house that had been a matrimonial home. Occupation by one spouse was to be treated as occupation by the other spouse. The Act provided for the transfer of certain tenancies on divorce.\nThe Domestic Violence and Matrimonial Proceedings Act 1976 made provision for varying rights of occupation where both spouses (and a man and woman living together as man and wife) had rights in the matrimonial home. The 1976 Act and the 1983 Acts were further developed by the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984, which also gave powers to the court in relation to the transfer of certain tenancies upon a decree of divorce, of nullity of marriage or of judicial separation.\nThe Mobile Homes Act 1983 replaced sections 1 to 6 of the Mobile Homes Act 1976. It introduced important new rules about security of tenure to owners of residential mobile home sites and to those who owned the mobile home and rented a pitch from the site owner (including local authorities but not traveller sites). It exempted those who rent the mobile home from the site owner and those who only use it for holiday purposes.\nIt also dealt with sales and gifts of mobile homes, inheritance and change of site ownership, pitch fees, other terms of agreements and provided machinery for dealing with disputes.\nThe Rent (Amendment) Act 1985 reversed the decision in Pocock v. Steel (1985 CA), which decided that an owner-occupier had to live in the house immediately before each and every letting to be able to obtain a mandatory order for possession. Words were inserted so that if it had \"at any time\" before the letting been occupied as the owner-occupier’s residence, Case l l Rent Act 1977 and the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 applied. This restored the original intention that had been destroyed by redrafting in the consolidation in 1968. This Act (apart from emergency legislation) broke all speed records in its passage through the Parliamentary timetables.\n\nOn 30 October 1985 there was a burst of general tidying up and consolidation with the publication of four Acts. The Housing (Consequential Provisions) Act 1985 repealed 80 parts of Acts or whole Acts relating to England and Wales, 18 relating to Scotland and 4 to Northern Ireland (from the Brine Pumping (Compensation for Subsidence) Act 1891 to Acts only just passed in 1985).\n\nThe Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 consolidated certain provisions relating to the law of landlord and tenant formerly found in the Housing Acts, Rent Acts and various other places. As such it created no new law. It incorporated sections as follows:\n\nThe Housing Associations Act 1985 consolidated certain provisions of the Housing Acts relating to housing associations and made some amendments to give effect to recommendations of the Law Commission and of the Scottish Law Commission. Its main headings were:\n\nThe Housing Act 1985 consolidated the Housing Acts (except the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 and the Housing Associations Act 1985) and certain related provisions, with amendments intended to implement the recommendations of the Law Commission. This mammoth initiative reduced the principal Acts relating to private lettings to the Rent Act 1977, the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 and the Housing Associations Act 1985. However, it was not to be very long before further amendments were needed.\n\nThe Housing and Planning Act 1986 required that lawful premiums (paid in respect of some shared ownership leases, certain long tenancies (sl27 Rent Act I977) should be taken into account in the determination of a fair rent.\nCertain shared ownership leases were excluded from the operation of the Rent Act 1977, the Rent (Agriculture) Act 1976 and Part I of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967.\n\nUntil the mid-1970s mortgages were largely unavailable for the purchase of flats (or large deposits were required with repayments at a high rate of interest). Large numbers of blocks of flats had been built in the 1930s usually on a leasehold basis for 99 years. Individual flats could only be sold on long leases for the remaining sixty or so years. Building societies did not consider this to be sufficient security for a mortgage. Once building societies changed their policies to offer 75% or sometimes larger mortgages at the same rates as paid for those for house purchases, landlords were able to sell flats as they became vacant on long leaseholds. Leases in older blocks with less than twenty years to run were almost impossible to sell. Landlords also began to offer long leases to sitting tenants sometimes at considerable discounts to open-market values. Now people rushed to get on the property ladder as house and flat prices rose as demand was stimulated. Investors from the Middle East after civil strife in Lebanon bought up many blocks of flats and moved to the UK.\n\nUnfortunately for the new flat owners, they inherited responsibilities in their new long leases that required them to contribute to the cost of the repair and replacement. Much of the equipment had been installed in the 1930s when the blocks built (lifts, central heating and hot water boilers, roofs and windows) which had been neglected in low rent times. Residents’ associations were few and it took almost ten years before legislation was introduce to control exploitation by landlords and managing agents (whose fees calculated on the total cost of new work often at inflated cost also had to be paid by residents).\nThe Nugee Committee Report (under the chairmanship of E. G. Nugee QC), which commenced work in February 1984, finally reported in February 1986 on the management of privately owned blocks of flats. The Landlord and Tenant Act 1987 implemented the main recommendations and contained certain other measures relating to the rights of tenants of such flats and other dwellings. Various parts of the Act came into force on dates between February 1988 and April 1989.\n\n\nFrom 15 January 1989 two systems were intended to operate side by side: one under the Rent Act 1977 and the other under the Housing Act 1988 depending upon whether the tenancy commenced before or after that date.\n\nFor all new tenancies, with a few exceptions, this new Act introduced:\n\nIt strengthened the penalties for harassment and unlawful eviction by a system of damages by making amendments to the Protection from Eviction Act 1977. In an obscure comer (Schedule I7 \"Minor and consequential amendments\") it removed the final remaining provision for the phasing of increases of rent - for housing association tenants.\n\nThe right to succession of statutory tenants was restricted, provision was made for the transfer of public sector tenancies to certain private sector landlords, Housing for Wales was established having functions relating to housing associations. The Act set up housing action trusts, made amendments to the right to buy, and provisions as to repair notices.\n\nIn Schedule 2 Part I there were mandatory grounds in which a court must order possession of an assured tenancy and other grounds in Part II in which a court may order possession. The Ground 8 of Part I dealt with the amount of arrears at the date of the court hearing. The amounts were reduced in the Housing Act 1996.\n\nBut besides introducing changes that, in the long term, affected the future of the Rent Officer's role, the Housing Act 1988 created important new additional functions relating to the assessment of housing benefit subsidy.\nPreviously, housing benefit had been administered by local authorities. There was strong evidence nationally of substantial fraudulent collusion between landlords and tenants when their tenants were claiming housing benefit . The resulting higher rents were also having an effect to increase open market rent levels for those not claiming housing benefit. Many millions of pounds of benefit subsidy were saved in the first year alone of Rent Officer intervention. Although Rent Officers, to cut costs, were discouraged from inspecting premises before making a valuation, inspections were made whenever resources were available and certainly where the property was unknown to them or where the amount of rent being paid seemed unreasonable for the known accommodation. Many fraudulent claims were discovered as a result of these inspections.\n\nThe Secretary of State was given powers to require Rent Officers to carry out these functions by Statutory Instrument. These have proved much easier to produce and amend to promote efficient working arrangements (rather than the longer timetable required to produce Acts of Parliament).\n\nThe original Order and an amendment were made in 1989. The main Order was The Rent Officers (Additional Functions) Order 1990 (S.I. 1990 No. 428), which established procedures by which a Rent Officer, upon receipt of an application from a local authority, was required to determine whether the rent payable under an assured tenancy by a housing benefit claimant, was significantly above the market rent. The availability of housing benefit was to be disregarded and an informal definition was to ask what rent someone not claiming housing benefit would be willing to pay from their own pocket for the accommodation. Tight timetables to be achieved in returning decisions (within four days or seven days where an inspection was necessary) so as not to create delays in payment of benefit during this additional process.\n\nThe Rent Officer was also required to determine whether the dwelling exceeded the size criteria set out in the order, which included consideration of the size of the household and the ages of its members. If the dwelling did exceed the criteria, the Rent Officer must determine a rent that accords with the size criteria for the occupiers.\n\nThere were provisions for a re-determination at the request of the local authority. The matter was to be dealt with by a maximum of two Rent Officers from adjoining registration areas who were to be advised by a Rent Officer from the original registration area (but not the person who made the original decision).\n\nFurther amendments were introduced by The Rent Officer (Additional Functions) (Amendment) Orders of 1991, 1993, 1994 and 1995 amongst which there was a requirement to decide whether the rent payable was exceptionally high for the size of that accommodation in that locality. lf it was, then the Rent Officer was required to determine a market rent that was not exceptionally high for a similar sized property.\n\nWhen services are performed or facilities provided or rights made available to the tenant the Rent Officer was initially required to make a separate determination of that part of the rent attributable to those services. Later this was changed so that it was not required to distinguish the amounts for furniture, meals or fuel charges.\n\nGrants for the repair and improvement of residential premises were amongst many other provisions in the Local Government and Housing Act 1989. These new renovation grants were also available for common parts of buildings; for the provision for facilities for the disabled; for the improvement or repair of (and conversion of houses into) houses in multiple occupation; and minor works such as thermal insulation.\n\nLocal authorities were given the opportunity to seek and act upon the advice of Rent Officers about the amount of the rent payable and of any increase in the rent payable, if the premises were already let. If unlet, advice could be sought and acted upon, of the amount of rent that might reasonably be expected to be obtained when the premises were let on an assured tenancy. Amendment was made to the Housing Act 1988 to include these additional functions for Rent Officers. A Statutory instrument later established the required procedures. Local authorities were empowered to seek the advice of Rent Officers for information to facilitate the calculation of grant payable. In respect of Scotland, there were further provisions in relation to the phasing progression to the registered rent for houses let by housing associations or Scottish Homes.\n\nLong standing, low rent tenancies entered into after section 186 of the Act came into force were to become assured tenancies when those long tenancies came to an end. The Rent Officer (Additional Functions) (No.2) Order 1990 required Rent Officers to give advice (within 45 days of the application) about the rent increases which might reasonably be expected when the renovation works were completed.\n\nFrom 4 January 1991, The Secretary of State for Wales exercised powers conferred by the Local Government and Housing Act 1989, and extended by the Welsh Language Act 1967, to prescribe certain forms for house renovation grants that could be submitted in the Welsh language, by statutory instrument, The Housing Renovation etc. Grant (Prescribed Forms and Particulars) Welsh Forms and Particulars) Regulations 1991.\nThere were further amendments in 1992 and 1994.\n\nThe Local Government Finance (Housing) (Consequential Amendments) Order 1993 introduced an amendment to Section 70 Rent Act 1977 so that the registered rent should take into account any sums payable by the tenant to the landlord in respect of council tax. Certain definitions were introduced by the Council Tax (Liability for Owners) Regulations 1992 and subsequently amended by statutory instrument.\nErs Mehefin 10fed 1993 mae Ysgrifennydd Gwladol Cymru, wrth ymarfer pwerau o dan Ddeddf Rhentu 1997 a estynnwyd gan Ddeddf Iaith 1967 drwy Offeryn Stadudol 1993/1511, wedi gwneud rheoliadau sydd yn rhagnodi fersiynau Cymraeg o’r ffurflenni y gellir eu defnyddio yn lle fersiynau Saesneg trwy Deddf Rhentu ac yn y blaen. (Ffurflenni Cymraeg a Manylion) Rheoliadau 1993.\n\nOn 10 June 1993, the Secretary of State for Wales in exercise of powers under the Rent Act 1977 extended by the Welsh Language Act 1967, by statutory instrument 1993/1511, made regulations that prescribed Welsh versions of the forms, which may be used in place of the English versions by the Rent Act 1977 etc.) (Welsh Forms and Particulars) Regulations 1993.\n\nThe Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act 1993 amongst many other provisions conferred rights to collective enfranchisement and lease renewal on tenants of flats and enfranchisement by tenants of houses. Decisions were to be made by leasehold valuation tribunals. Provision was made for auditing the management and service charges claimed for residential property and to promote codes of good management practice.\n\nThe Family Law Act 1996 (which made provision with respect to divorce and separation and legal aid in connection with mediation in disputes relating to family matters) included legislation dealing with the right of occupation of certain domestic premises and the transfer of tenancies between spouses and persons who have lived together as husband and wife.\n\nThe Housing Act 1996 included provisions about the social rented sector; houses in multiple occupation; the administration of housing benefit, the conduct of tenants, the allocation of housing by local housing authorities and homelessness.\n\nA landlord may not now exercise a right of re-entry or forfeiture for failure to pay a service charge unless it has been agreed by the tenant or has been the subject of a determination by a court or appeal tribunal. New rules were made about the determination of reasonableness of service charges and the rights upon application by a tenants’ association to appoint a surveyor to advise on service charges, amending the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985. The power to appoint of a manager of property was transferred from the courts to a leasehold valuation tribunal by amendments to the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987.\n\nSection 122 enabled the Secretary of State by making a statutory order (to be made by statutory instrument) to require Rent Officers to carry out specified functions in connection with housing benefit and rent allowance subsidy. It enabled a prospective landlord to apply to the Rent Officer for a determination for the purposes of any application for housing benefit made by a tenant of a dwelling that the landlord proposes to let.\n\nA local authority or a housing action trust were given the right to elect to operate an introductory tenancy regime. Introductory tenancies (and licences to occupy) were to be granted to tenants for a trial period. There were provisions for succession to introductory tenancies after the death of the tenant to the tenant’s spouse or a member of his family who had resided with the tenant in the previous twelve months.\n\nChapter III gave power to the High Court or a county court on application by a local authority to grant injunctions against anti-social behaviour and gave the power of arrest for breach of injunctions. Some of the provisions of this act came into force on Royal Assent, some two months later and some on a day in the future to be appointed by order of the Secretary of State. Some provisions additionally applied to the Isles of Scilly, Northern Island and Scotland but not all.\n\nThe Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 made provision for renovation grants and other assistance for housing purposes for the improvement or repair of dwellings, houses in multiple occupation or the common parts of buildings containing one or more flats. It incorporated disabled facilities grants for the provision of facilities for a disabled person. Buildings had to be more than ten years old.\n\nThere were to be grants and other assistance for regeneration and development and in connection with clearance areas, home energy efficiency schemes. Grants were to be made available to home owners where the occupiers were entitled to social benefits and home repair assistance for mobile home or houseboat owners. Rent Officers continued to give advice to local authorities as they had done previously in the administration of house renovation grants. This statutory function ceased in 2000.\n\nThe Rents Act (Maximum Fair Rent) Order 1999 was introduced in Statutory Instrument 1999 No. 6 and came into force on 1 February 1999. The Rent Officer continued to determine a fair rent as previously but was then required to calculate by a formula the maximum rent payable if this was lower than the fair rent. The formula required a comparison between the retail price index at the date of the previous registration and the retail price index for the month immediately preceding the new determination of a fair rent. There was an addition of 0.075 for the first registration after this new order came into force and 0.05 for every subsequent registration. Variable service charges were not included in the calculation of the formula.\n\nThe Maximum Fair Rent did not apply where there had been a change in the condition of the dwelling house of the common parts as a result of repairs or improvements carried out by the landlord if the new rent determined as a result of these repairs or improvements exceeded the previous registered rent by at least 15%. The Maximum Fair Rent was to be recalculated if the rent registered by the Rent Officer upon an application made on or after 1 February 1999, was referred to a Rent Assessment Committee. Retail Prices Index used by Rent Officers and Rent Assessment committees is the monthly United Kingdom Index of Retail Prices (for all items), which is available from the Office for National Statistics or online.\n\nThe Rent Officer Service through the Institute of Rent Officers had been consulted in the past about legislative changes and procedures. Suggestions were made through annual reports most of which were eventually incorporated into legislation. One such recommendation was the creation of a nation service either as an executive agency or as a Non Departmental Public Body (NDPB).\n\nThe Rent Officer Service was established as The Rent Service as an executive agency of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions on 1 October 1999. Significant opportunities for service improvements were able to be made in line with the government’s modernising objectives. The Rent Service became a single, national service with local delivery, building on existing experience to secure better performance and improved customer service. The new organisation focused on faster processing of cases and consistency in valuation practice and decision making. New information technology systems were introduced and greater openness and accountability was promoted whilst maintaining impartiality in valuations.\n\nAs no new protected tenancies had been created after 15 January 1989 after the Housing Act 1988 fewer applications for fair rents were received in most areas of the country except in central London. There had however been a substantial increase in housing benefit valuations, and on 1 April 2004 The Rent Service was transferred to the Department for Work and Pensions DWP), which was the government department responsible for housing benefit legislation.\n\nA major change to the valuation process for housing benefit was the Local Housing Allowance (LHA) a flat rate allowance paid to housing benefit claimants, which was introduced on 7 April 2008 as part of the welfare reform programme. It applies to private sector tenants who make a new claim for housing benefit or those claiming housing benefit who change address. It will also apply to tenants claiming housing benefit who move from the social sector into private sector accommodation. LHA is a standard allowance based on the number of bedrooms: shared room (room in a shared property); one bedroom, two bedrooms, three bedrooms, four bedrooms and five bedrooms, in an area known as a Broad Rental Market Area (BRMA). It is the median rent of private sector lettings for that size of accommodation in the BRMA.\n\nThe BRMA is a geographical area where a person could reasonably be expected to live, taking into account access to facilities and services for the purpose of health, education, recreation, personal banking and shopping. The distance of travel to and from those facilities by public and private transport is taken into account and local authorities are consulted when BRMA are reviewed. BRMA boundaries do not have to match the boundaries of a local authority and often fall across more than one local authority area.\n\nThe key to the success of this LHA is the regular review of the BRMA across England by the Rent Officer and the extensive development of lettings information now held by The Rent Service. BRMA decisions and LHA levels are published monthly on a new web portal. The published data includes full details and rationales for the BRMA and the list of rents gathered for each property size in that BRMA. On 1 April 2009 the residual function of The Rent Service were transferred to become a part of the Valuation Office Agency.\n\nChanges to the local housing allowance were announced in the June 2010 budget. The first changes are planned to come into effect between April 2011 and October 2011. The VOA Rent Officers now provide the BRMA and lettings data on a new facility for London.\n\nIn 1999, the House of Lords found in \"Fitzpatrick v Sterling Housing Association Ltd\" that a protected tenancy could be passed on to a gay cohabiting partner (before the availability of either civil partnerships or same-sex marriage) as the couple could be considered a \"family\" under the Rent Act 1977.\n\n"}
{"id": "30875702", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30875702", "title": "Insulated glazing", "text": "Insulated glazing\n\nInsulating glass (IG), more commonly known as double glazing (or double-pane, and increasingly triple glazing/pane), consists of two or three glass window panes separated by a vacuum or gas filled space to reduce heat transfer across a part of the building envelope.\n\nInsulating glass units (IGUs) are manufactured with glass in range of thickness from 3 to 10 mm (1/8\" to 3/8\") or more in special applications. Laminated or tempered glass may also be used as part of the construction. Most units are produced with the same thickness of glass used on both panes but special applications such as acoustic attenuation or security may require wide ranges of thicknesses to be incorporated in the same unit.\n\nInsulating glass is an evolution from older technologies known as double-hung windows and storm windows. Traditional double-hung windows used a single pane of glass to separate the interior and exterior spaces.\nTraditional storm windows and screens are relatively time consuming and labor-intensive, requiring removal and storage of the storm windows in the spring, and reinstallation in the fall and storage of the screens. The weight of the large storm window frame and glass makes replacement on upper-stories of tall buildings a difficult task requiring repeatedly climbing a ladder with each window and trying to hold the window in place while securing retaining clips around the edges.\nHowever, current reproductions of these old-style storm windows can be made with detachable glass in the bottom pane that can be replaced with a detachable screen when desired. This eliminates the need for changing the entire storm window according to the seasons.\n\nInsulated glazing forms a very compact multi-layer sandwich of air and glass, which eliminates the need for storm windows. Screens may also be left installed year-round with insulated glazing, and can be installed in a manner that permits installation and removal from inside the building, eliminating the requirement to climb up the exterior of the house hto service the windows. It is possible to retrofit insulated glazing into traditional double-hung frames, though this would require significant modification to the wood framed due to the increased thickness of the IG assembly.\n\nModern window units with IG typically completely replace the older double-hung unit, and include other improvements such as better sealing between the upper and lower windows, and spring-operated weight balancing that removes the need for large hanging weights inside the wall next to the windows, allowing for more insulation around the window and reducing air leakage, provides robust protection against the sun and will keep the house cool in the hot summer and warm in winter. These spring-operated balancing mechanisms also typically permit the top of the windows to swing inward, permitting cleaning of the exterior of the IG window from inside the building.\n\nThe glass panes are separated by a \"spacer\". A spacer, also known as a warm edge, is the piece that separates the two panes of glass in an insulating glass system, and seals the gas space between them. Historically, spacers were made primarily of metal and fiber, which manufacturers thought provided more durability.\n\nHowever, metal spacers conduct heat (unless the metal is thermally improved), undermining the ability of the insulated glass unit (IGU) to reduce heat flow. It may also result in water or ice forming at the bottom of the sealed unit because of the sharp temperature difference between the window and surrounding air. To reduce heat transfer through the spacer and increase overall thermal performance, manufacturers may make the spacer out of a less-conductive material such as structural foam. A spacer made of aluminum that also contains a highly structural thermal barrier reduces condensation on the glass surface and improves insulation, as measured by the overall U-value.\n\nIGUs are often manufactured on a made to order basis on factory production lines, but standard units are also available. The width and height dimensions, the thickness of the glass panes and the type of glass for each pane as well as the overall thickness of the unit must be supplied to the manufacturer. On the assembly line, spacers of specific thicknesses are cut and assembled into the required overall width and height dimensions and filled with desiccant. On a parallel line, glass panes are cut to size and washed to be optically clear.\n\nAn adhesive sealant (polyisobutylene) is applied to the face of the spacer on each side and the panes pressed against the spacer. If the unit is gas filled, two holes are drilled into the spacer of the assembled unit, lines are attached to draw out the air out of the space and replacing it (or leaving just vacuum) with the desired gas. The lines are then removed and holes sealed to contain the gas. The more modern technique is to use an online gas filler, which eliminates the need to drill holes in the spacer. The units are then sealed on the edge side using either polysulfide or silicone sealant or similar material to prevent humid outside air from entering the unit. The desiccant will remove traces of humidity from the air space so that no water appears on the inside faces (no condensation) of the glass panes facing the air space during cold weather. Some manufacturers have developed specific processes that combine the spacer and desiccant into a single step application system.\n\nThe insulating glazing unit, consisting of two glass panes bound together into a single unit with a seal between the edges of the panes, was patented in the United States by Thomas Stetson in 1865. It was developed into a commercial product in the 1930s, when several patents were filed, and a product was announced by the Libbey-Owens-Ford Glass Company in 1944. Their product was sold under the Thermopane brand name, which had been registered as a trademark in 1941. The Thermopane technology differs significantly from contemporary IGUs. The two panes of glass were welded together by a glass seal, and the two panes were separated by less than the typical of modern units. The brand name Thermopane has entered the vocabulary of the glazing industry as the genericized trademark for any IGU.\n\nThe maximum insulating efficiency of a standard IGU is determined by the thickness of the space. Typically, most sealed units achieve maximum insulating values using a space of when measured at the centre of the IGU.\n\nIGU thickness is a compromise between maximizing insulating value and the ability of the framing system used to carry the unit. Some residential and most commercial glazing systems can accommodate the ideal thickness of a double-paned unit. Issues arise with the use of triple glazing to further reduce heat loss in an IGU. The combination of thickness and weight results in units that are too unwieldy for most residential or commercial glazing systems, particularly if these panes are contained in moving frames or sashes.\n\nThis trade-off does not apply to vacuum insulated glass (VIG), or evacuated glazing, as heat loss due to convection is eliminated, leaving radiation losses and conduction through the edge seal and required supporting pillars over the face area. These VIG units have most of the air removed from the space between the panes, leaving a nearly-complete vacuum. VIG units which are currently on the market are hermetically sealed along their perimeter with solder glass, that is, a glass frit (powdered glass) having a reduced melting point is heated to join the components. This creates a glass seal that experiences increasing stress with increasing temperature differential across the unit. This stress may limit the maximum allowable temperature differential. One manufacturer provides a recommendation of 35 °C. Closely spaced pillars are required to reinforce the glazing to resist the pressure of the atmosphere. Pillar spacing and diameter limited the insulation achieved by designs available beginning in the 1990s to R = 4.7 h·°F·ft2/BTU (0.83 m2·K/W) no better than high quality double glazed insulated glass units. Recent products claim performance of R = 14 h·°F·ft2/BTU (2.5 m2·K/W) which exceeds triple glazed insulated glass units. The required internal pillars exclude applications where an unobstructed view through the glazing unit is desired, i.e. most residential and commercial windows, and refrigerated food display cases.\n\nVacuum technology is also used in some non-transparent insulation products called vacuum insulated panels.\n\nAn older-established way to improve insulation performance is to replace air in the space with a lower thermal conductivity gas. Gas convective heat transfer is a function of viscosity and specific heat. Monatomic gases such as argon, krypton and xenon are often used since (at normal temperatures) they do not carry heat in rotational modes, resulting in a lower heat capacity than poly-atomic gases. Argon has a thermal conductivity 67% that of air, krypton has about half the conductivity of argon. Argon is almost 1% of the atmosphere and isolated at a moderate cost. Krypton and xenon are only trace components of the atmosphere and very expensive. All of these \"noble\" gases are non-toxic, clear, odorless, chemically inert, and commercially available because of their widespread application in industry. Some manufacturers also offer sulfur hexafluoride as an insulating gas, especially to insulate sound. It has only 2/3 the conductivity of argon, but it is stable, inexpensive and dense. However, sulfur hexafluoride is an extremely potent greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. In Europe, falls under the F-Gas directive which ban or control its usage for several applications. Since 1 January 2006, is banned as a tracer gas and in all applications except high-voltage switchgear.\n\nIn general, the more effective a fill gas is at its optimum thickness, the thinner the optimum thickness is. For example, the optimum thickness for krypton is lower than for argon, and lower for argon than for air. However, since it is difficult to determine whether the gas in an IGU has become mixed with air at time of manufacture (or becomes mixed with air once installed), many designers prefer to use thicker gaps than would be optimum for the fill gas if it were pure. Argon is commonly used in insulated glazing as it is the most affordable. Krypton, which is considerably more expensive, is not generally used except to produce very thin double glazing units or extremely high performance triple-glazed units. Xenon has found very little application in IGUs because of cost.\n\nThe effectiveness of insulated glass can be expressed as an R-value. The higher the R-value, the greater is its resistance to heat transfer. A standard IGU consisting of clear uncoated panes of glass (or lights) with air in the cavity between the lights typically has an R-value of 0.35 K·m/W.\n\nUsing US customary units, a rule of thumb in standard IGU construction is that each change in the component of the IGU results in an increase of 1 R-value to the efficiency of the unit. Adding argon gas increases the efficiency to about R-3. Using low emissivity glass on surface #2 will add another R-value. Properly designed triple-glazed IGUs with low emissivity coatings on surfaces #2 and #4 and filled with argon gas in the cavities result in IG units with R-values as high as R-5. Certain vacuum insulated glass units (VIGU) or multi-chambered IG units using coated plastic films result in R-values as high as R-12.5\n\nAdditional layers of glazing provide the opportunity for improved insulation. While the standard double glazing is most widely used, triple glazing is not uncommon, and quadruple glazing is produced for very cold environments such as Alaska. Even quintuple glazing (four cavities, five panes) is available - with mid-pane insulation factors equivalent to walls.\n\nIn some situations the insulation is in reference to noise mitigation. In these circumstances a large air space improves the noise insulation quality or sound transmission class. Asymmetric double glazing, using different thicknesses of glass rather than the conventional symmetrical systems (equal glass thicknesses used for both lights) will improve the acoustic attenuation properties of the IGU. If standard air spaces are used, sulfur hexafluoride can be used to replace or augment an inert gas and improve acoustical attenuation performance.\n\nOther glazing material variations affect acoustics. The most widely used glazing configurations for sound dampening include laminated glass with varied thickness of the interlayer and thickness of the glass. Including a structural, thermally improved aluminum thermal barrier air spacer in the insulating glass can improve acoustical performance by reducing the transmission of exterior noise sources in the fenestration system.\n\nReviewing the glazing system components, including the air space material used in the insulating glass, can ensure overall sound transmission improvement.\n\nThe life of an IGU varies depending on the quality of materials used, size of gap between inner and outer pane, temperature differences, workmanship and location of installation both in terms of facing direction and geographic location, as well as the treatment the unit receives. IG units typically last from 10 to 25 years, with windows facing the equator often lasting less than 12 years. IGUs typically carry a warranty for 10 to 20 years depending upon the manufacturer. If IGUs are altered (such as installation of a solar control film) the warranty may be voided by the manufacturer.\n\nThe Insulating Glass Manufacturers Alliance (IGMA) undertook an extensive study to characterize the failures of commercial insulating glass units over a 25-year period.\n\nFor a standard construction IG unit, condensation collects between the layers of glass when the perimeter seal has failed and when the desiccant has become saturated, and can generally only be eliminated by replacing the IGU. Seal failure and subsequent replacement results in a significant factor in the overall cost of owning IGUs.\n\nLarge temperature differences between the inner and outer panes stress the spacer adhesives, which can eventually fail. Units with a small gap between the panes are more prone to failure because of the increased stress.\n\nAtmospheric pressure changes combined with wet weather can, in rare cases, eventually lead to the gap filling with water.\n\nThe flexible sealing surfaces preventing infiltration around the window unit can also degrade or be torn or damaged. Replacement of these seals can be difficult to impossible, due to IG windows commonly using extruded channel frames without seal retention screws or plates. Instead, the edge seals are installed by pushing an arrow-shaped indented one-way flexible lip into a slot on the extruded channel, and often cannot be easily extracted from the extruded slot to be replaced.\n\nIn Canada, since the beginning of 1990, there are some companies offering servicing of failed IG units. They provide open ventilation to the atmosphere by drilling hole(s) in the glass and/or spacer. This solution often reverses the visible condensation, but cannot clean the interior surface of the glass and staining that may have occurred after long-term exposure to moisture. They may offer a warranty from 5 to 20 years. This solution lowers the insulating value of the window, but it can be a \"green\" solution when the window is still in good condition. If the IG unit had a gas fill (e.g. argon or krypton or a mixture) the gas is naturally dissipated and the R-value suffers.\n\nSince 2004, there are also some companies offering the same restoration process for failed double-glazed units in the UK, and there is one company offering restoration of failed IG units in Ireland since 2010.\n\nThermal stress cracking isn't different for insulated glazing and uninsulated glazing. Temperature differences across the surface of glass panes can lead to cracking of the glass. This typically occurs where the glass is partially shaded and one section is heated in sunlight. Tinted glass increases heating and thermal stress, while annealing reduces internal stress built into the glass during manufacturing leaving more strength available to resist thermal cracking. \n\nThermal expansion creates internal pressure, or stress, where expanding warm material is retrained by cooler material. A crack may form if the stress exceeds the material strength and the crack will propagate until the stress at the tip of the crack is below the material's strength. Typically cracks initiate and propagate from the narrow shaded cut edge where the material is weak and the stress is spread over a small glass volume compared to the open area. Glass thickness has no direct effect on thermal cracking in windows because both thermal stress and material strength are proportional to thickness. While thicker glass will have more strength remaining after supporting wind loads, that's usually only a significant factor for large glazing units on tall buildings and wind improves heat dissipation. Increased resistance to cracking with thicker glazing in common residential and commercial applications is more reliably result of using tempered glass to satisfy building safety codes requiring its use to reduce the severity of injuries when broken. Cut edge stresses have to be reduced by annealing prior to tempering and that removes stress concentrations created during glass cutting and that significantly increases the stress required to initiate a crack from the edge. The cost to process tempered glass is much greater than the cost difference between 1/8\" (3 mm) glass and 3/16\" (5 mm) or 1/4\" (6.5 mm) material, prompting glaziers to suggest replacing cracked glazing with thicker glass. It may also avoid revealing to the customer that tempered glass should have been used initially.\n\nGiven the thermal properties of the sash, frame, and sill, and the dimensions of the glazing and thermal properties of the glass, the heat transfer rate for a given window and set of conditions can be calculated.\nThis can be calculated in kW (kilowatts), but more usefully for cost benefit calculations can be stated as kWh pa (kilowatt hours per annum), based on the typical conditions over a year for a given location.\n\nThe glass panels in double-glazed windows transmit heat in both directions by radiation, through the glazing by conduction and across the gap between the panes by convection, by conduction through the frame, and by infiltration around the perimeter seals and the frame's seal to the building. The actual rates will vary with the conditions throughout the year, and while solar gain may be much welcomed in the winter (depending on local climate), it may result in increased air conditioning costs in the summer. Unwanted heat transfer can be mitigated by for example using curtains at night in the winter and using sun shades during the day in the summer. In an attempt to provide a useful comparison between alternative window constructions the British Fenestration Rating Council have defined a \"Window Energy Rating\" WER, ranging from A for the best down through B and C etc. This takes into account a combination of the heat loss through the window (U value, the reciprocal of R-value), the solar gain (g value), and loss through air leakage around the frame (L value). For example, an A Rated window will in a typical year gain as much heat from solar gain as it loses in other ways (however the majority of this gain will occur during the summer months, when the heat may not be needed by the building occupant). This provides better thermal performance than a typical wall.\n\n\n"}

Resolution 2200A (XXI), and came in force from 3 January 1976. It commits its parties to work toward the granting of economic, social, and cultural rights (ESCR) to the Non-Self-Governing and Trust Territories and individuals, including labour rights and the right to health, the right to education, and the right to an adequate standard of living. As of September 2018, the Covenant has 169 parties. A further four countries, including the United States, have signed but not ratified the Covenant.\n\nThe ICESCR (and its Optional Protocol) is part of the International Bill of Human Rights, along with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), including the latter's first and second Optional Protocols.\n\nThe Covenant is monitored by the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.\n\nThe ICESCR has its roots in the same process that led to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. A \"Declaration on the Essential Rights of Man\" had been proposed at the 1945 San Francisco Conference which led to the founding of the United Nations, and the Economic and Social Council was given the task of drafting it. Early on in the process, the document was split into a declaration setting forth general principles of human rights, and a convention or covenant containing binding commitments. The former evolved into the UDHR and was adopted on 10 December 1948.\n\nDrafting continued on the convention, but there remained significant differences between UN members on the relative importance of negative civil and political versus positive economic, social and cultural rights. These eventually caused the convention to be split into two separate covenants, \"one to contain civil and political rights and the other to contain economic, social and cultural rights.\" The two covenants were to contain as many similar provisions as possible, and be opened for signature simultaneously. Each would also contain an article on the right of all peoples to self-determination.\n\nThe States Parties to the present Covenant, including those having responsibility for the administration of Non-Self-Governing and Trust Territories, shall promote the realization of the right of self-determination, and shall respect that right, in conformity with the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations.\n\nThe first document became the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the second the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The drafts were presented to the UN General Assembly for discussion in 1954, and adopted in 1966.\n\nThe Covenant follows the structure of the UDHR and the ICCPR, with a preamble and thirty-one articles, divided into five parts.\n\nPart 1 (Article 1) recognises the right of all peoples to self-determination, including the right to \"freely determine their political status\", pursue their economic, social and cultural goals, and manage and dispose of their own resources. It recognises a negative right of a people not to be deprived of its means of subsistence, and imposes an obligation on those parties still responsible for non-self governing and trust territories (colonies) to encourage and respect their self-determination.\n\nPart 2 (Articles 2–5) establishes the principle of \"progressive realisation\" – see below. It also requires the rights be recognised \"without discrimination of any kind as to race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status\". The rights can only be limited by law, in a manner compatible with the nature of the rights, and only for the purpose of \"promoting the general welfare in a democratic society\".\n\nPart 3 (Articles 6–15) lists the rights themselves. These include rights to\n\nMany of these rights include specific actions which must be undertaken to realise them.\n\nPart 4 (Articles 16–25) governs reporting and monitoring of the Covenant and the steps taken by the parties to implement it. It also allows the monitoring body – originally the United Nations Economic and Social Council – now the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights – see below – to make general recommendations to the UN General Assembly on appropriate measures to realise the rights (Article 21)\n\nPart 5 (Articles 26–31) governs ratification, entry into force, and amendment of the Covenant.\n\nArticle 2 of the Covenant imposes a duty on all parties to\n\ntake steps... to the maximum of its available resources, with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights recognized in the present Covenant by all appropriate means, including particularly the adoption of legislative measures.\n\nThis is known as the principle of \"progressive realisation\". It acknowledges that some of the rights (for example, the right to health) may be difficult in practice to achieve in a short period of time, and that states may be subject to resource constraints, but requires them to act as best they can within their means.\n\nThe principle differs from that of the ICCPR, which obliges parties to \"respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction\" the rights in that Convention. However, it does not render the Covenant meaningless. The requirement to \"take steps\" imposes a continuing obligation to work towards the realisation of the rights. It also rules out deliberately regressive measures which impede that goal. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights also interprets the principle as imposing minimum core obligations to provide, at the least, minimum essential levels of each of the rights. If resources are highly constrained, this should include the use of targeted programmes aimed at the vulnerable.\n\nThe Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights regards legislation as an indispensable means for realising the rights which is unlikely to be limited by resource constraints. The enacting of anti-discrimination provisions and the establishment of enforceable rights with judicial remedies within national legal systems are considered to be appropriate means. Some provisions, such as anti-discrimination laws, are already required under other human rights instruments, such as the ICCPR.\n\nArticle 6 of the Covenant recognises the right to work, defined as the opportunity of everyone to gain their living by freely chosen or accepted work. Parties are required to take \"appropriate steps\" to safeguard this right, including technical and vocational training and economic policies aimed at steady economic development and ultimately full employment. The right implies parties must guarantee equal access to employment and protect workers from being unfairly deprived of employment. They must prevent discrimination in the workplace and ensure access for the disadvantaged. The fact that work must be freely chosen or accepted means parties must prohibit forced or child labor.\n\nThe work referred to in Article 6 must be \"decent work\". This is effectively defined by Article 7 of the Covenant, which recognises the right of everyone to \"just and favourable\" working conditions. These are in turn defined as fair wages with equal pay for equal work, sufficient to provide a decent living for workers and their dependants; safe working conditions; equal opportunity in the workplace; and sufficient rest and leisure, including limited working hours and regular, paid holidays.\n\nArticle 8 recognises the right of workers to form or join trade unions and protects the right to strike. It allows these rights to be restricted for members of the armed forces, police, or government administrators. Several parties have placed reservations on this clause, allowing it to be interpreted in a manner consistent with their constitutions (e.g., China, Mexico), or extending the restriction of union rights to groups such as firefighters (e.g., Japan).\n\nArticle 9 of the Covenant recognizes \"the right of everyone to social security, including social insurance\". It requires parties to provide some form of social insurance scheme to protect people against the risks of sickness, disability, maternity, employment injury, unemployment or old age; to provide for survivors, orphans, and those who cannot afford health care; and to ensure that families are adequately supported. Benefits from such a scheme must be adequate, accessible to all, and provided without discrimination. The Covenant does not restrict the form of the scheme, and both contributory and non-contributory schemes are permissible (as are community-based and mutual schemes).\n\nThe Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has noted persistent problems with the implementation of this right, with very low levels of access.\n\nSeveral parties, including France and Monaco, have reservations allowing them to set residence requirements in order to qualify for social benefits. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights permits such restrictions, provided they are proportionate and reasonable.\n\nArticle 10 of the Covenant recognises the family as \"the natural and fundamental group unit of society\", and requires parties to accord it \"the widest possible protection and assistance\". Parties must ensure that their citizens are free to establish families and that marriages are freely contracted and not forced. Parties must also provide paid leave or adequate social security to mothers before and after childbirth, an obligation which overlaps with that of Article 9. Finally, parties must take \"special measures\" to protect children from economic or social exploitation, including setting a minimum age of employment and barring children from dangerous and harmful occupations.\n\nArticle 11 recognises the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living. This includes, but is not limited to, the right to adequate food, clothing, housing, and \"the continuous improvement of living conditions\". It also creates an obligation on parties to work together to eliminate world hunger.\n\nThe right to adequate food, also referred to as the right to food, is interpreted as requiring \"the availability of food in a quantity and quality sufficient to satisfy the dietary needs of individuals, free from adverse substances, and acceptable within a given culture\". This must be accessible to all, implying an obligation to provide special programmes for the vulnerable. This must also ensure an equitable distribution of world food supplies in relation to need, taking into account the problems of food-importing and food-exporting countries. The right to adequate food also implies a right to water.\n\nThe right to adequate housing, also referred to as the right to housing, is \"the right to live somewhere in security, peace and dignity\". It requires \"adequate privacy, adequate space, adequate security, adequate lighting and ventilation, adequate basic infrastructure and adequate location with regard to work and basic facilities – all at a reasonable cost\". Parties must ensure security of tenure and that access is free of discrimination, and progressively work to eliminate homelessness. Forced evictions, defined as \"the permanent or temporary removal against their will of individuals, families and/or communities from the homes and/or land which they occupy, without the provision of, and access to, appropriate forms of legal or other protection\", are a prima facie violation of the Covenant.\n\nThe right to adequate clothing, also referred to as the right to clothing, has not been authoritatively defined and has received little in the way of academic commentary or international discussion. What is considered \"adequate\" has only been discussed in specific contexts, such as refugees, the disabled, the elderly, or workers.\n\nArticle 12 of the Covenant recognises the right of everyone to \"the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health\". \"Health\" is understood not just as a right to be healthy, but as a right to control one's own health and body (including reproduction), and be free from interference such as torture or medical experimentation. States must protect this right by ensuring that everyone within their jurisdiction has access to the underlying determinants of health, such as clean water, sanitation, food, nutrition and housing, and through a comprehensive system of healthcare, which is available to everyone without discrimination, and economically accessible to all.\n\nArticle 12.2 requires parties to take specific steps to improve the health of their citizens, including reducing infant mortality and improving child health, improving environmental and workplace health, preventing, controlling and treating epidemic diseases, and creating conditions to ensure equal and timely access to medical services for all. These are considered to be \"illustrative, non-exhaustive examples\", rather than a complete statement of parties' obligations.\n\nThe right to health is interpreted as requiring parties to respect women's' reproductive rights, by not limiting access to contraception or \"censoring, withholding or intentionally misrepresenting\" information about sexual health. They must also ensure that women are protected from harmful traditional practices such as female genital mutilation.\n\nRight to health is inclusive right extending not only to timely and appropriate health care but also to the underlying determinants of health, such as access to safe and potable water and adequate sanitation, an adequate supply of safe food, nutrition and housing, healthy occupational and environmental conditions.\n\nArticle 13 of the Covenant recognises the right of everyone to free education (free for the primary level and \"the progressive introduction of free education\" for the secondary and higher levels). This is to be directed towards \"the full development of the human personality and the sense of its dignity\", and enable all persons to participate effectively in society. Education is seen both as a human right and as \"an indispensable means of realizing other human rights\", and so this is one of the longest and most important articles of the Covenant.\n\nArticle 13.2 lists a number of specific steps parties are required to pursue to realise the right of education. These include the provision of free, universal and compulsory primary education, \"generally available and accessible\" secondary education in various forms (including technical and vocational training), and equally accessible higher education. All of these must be available to all without discrimination. Parties must also develop a school system (though it may be public, private, or mixed), encourage or provide scholarships for disadvantaged groups. Parties are required to make education free at all levels, either immediately or progressively; \"[p]rimary education shall be compulsory and available free to all\"; secondary education \"shall be made generally available and accessible to all by every appropriate means, and in particular by the progressive introduction of free education\"; and \"[h]igher education shall be made equally accessible to all, on the basis of capacity, by every appropriate means, and in particular by the progressive introduction of free education\".\n\nArticles 13.3 and 13.4 require parties to respect the educational freedom of parents by allowing them to choose and establish private educational institutions for their children, also referred to as freedom of education. It also recognises the right of parents to \"ensure the religious and moral education of their children in conformity with their own convictions\". This is interpreted as requiring public schools to respect the freedom of religion and conscience of their students, and as forbidding instruction in a particular religion or belief system unless non-discriminatory exemptions and alternatives are available.\n\nThe Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights interpret the Covenant as also requiring states to respect the academic freedom of staff and students, as this is vital for the educational process. It also considers corporal punishment in schools to be inconsistent with the Covenant's underlying principle of the dignity of the individual.\n\nArticle 14 of the Covenant requires those parties which have not yet established a system of free compulsory primary education, to rapidly adopt a detailed plan of action for its introduction \"within a reasonable number of years\".\n\nArticle 15 of the Covenant recognises the right of everyone to participate in cultural life, enjoy the benefits of scientific progress, and to benefit from the protection of the moral and material rights to any scientific discovery or artistic work they have created. The latter clause is sometimes seen as requiring the protection of intellectual property, but the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights interprets it as primarily protecting the moral rights of authors and \"proclaim[ing] the intrinsically personal character of every creation of the human mind and the ensuing durable link between creators and their creations\". It thus requires parties to respect the right of authors to be recognised as the creator of a work. The material rights are interpreted as being part of the right to an adequate standard of living, and \"need not extend over the entire lifespan of an author.\"\n\nParties must also work to promote the conservation, development and diffusion of science and culture, \"respect the freedom indispensable for scientific research and creative activity\", and encourage international contacts and cooperation in these fields.\n\nA number of parties have made reservations and interpretative declarations to their application of the Covenant.\n\nAlgeria interprets parts of Article 13, protecting the liberty of parents to freely choose or establish suitable educational institutions, so as not to \"impair its right freely to organize its educational system.\"\n\nBangladesh interprets the self-determination clause in Article 1 as applying in the historical context of colonialism. It also reserves the right to interpret the labour rights in Articles 7 and 8 and the non-discrimination clauses of Articles 2 and 3 within the context of its constitution and domestic law.\n\nBelgium interprets non-discrimination as to national origin as \"not necessarily implying an obligation on States automatically to guarantee to foreigners the same rights as to their nationals. The term should be understood to refer to the elimination of any arbitrary behaviour but not of differences in treatment based on objective and reasonable considerations, in conformity with the principles prevailing in democratic societies.\"\n\nChina restricts labour rights in Article 8 in a manner consistent with its constitution and domestic law.\n\nEgypt accepts the Covenant only to the extent it does not conflict with Islamic Sharia law. Sharia is \"a primary source of legislation\" under Article 2 of both the suspended and the .\n\nFrance views the Covenant as subservient to the UN Charter. It also reserves the right to govern the access of aliens to employment, social security, and other benefits.\n\nIndia interprets the right of self-determination as applying \"only to the peoples under foreign domination\" and not to apply to peoples within sovereign nation-states. It also interprets the limitation of rights clause and the rights of equal opportunity in the workplace within the context of its constitution.\n\nIndonesia interprets the self-determination clause (Article 1) within the context of other international law and as not applying to peoples within a sovereign nation-state.\n\nIreland reserves the right to promote the Irish language.\n\nJapan reserved the right not to be bound to progressively introduce free secondary and higher education, the right to strike for public servant and the remuneration on public holidays.\n\nKuwait interprets the non-discrimination clauses of Articles 2 and 3 within its constitution and laws, and reserves the right to social security to apply only to Kuwaitis. It also reserves the right to forbid strikes.\n\nMexico restricts the labour rights in Article 8 within the context of its constitution and laws.\n\nMonaco interprets the principle of non-discrimination on the grounds of national origin as \"not necessarily implying an automatic obligation on the part of States to guarantee foreigners the same rights as their nationals\", and reserves the right to set residence requirements on the rights to work, health, education, and social security.\n\nNew Zealand reserved the right not to apply Article 8 (the right to form and join trade unions) insofar as existing measures (which at the time included compulsory unionism and encouraged arbitration of disputes) were incompatible with it.\n\nNorway reserves the right to strike so as to allow for compulsory arbitration of some labour disputes.\n\nPakistan has a general reservation to interpret the Covenant within the framework of its constitution.\n\nThailand interprets the right to self-determination within the framework of other international law.\n\nTrinidad and Tobago reserves the right to restrict the right to strike of those engaged in essential occupations.\n\nTurkey will implement the Covenant subject to the UN Charter. It also reserves the right to interpret and implement the right of parents to choose and establish educational institutions in a manner compatible with its constitution.\n\nUnited Kingdom views the Covenant as subservient to the UN Charter. It made several reservations regarding its overseas territories.\n\nUnited States – Amnesty International writes that \"The United States signed the Covenant in 1979 under the Carter administration but is not fully bound by it until it is ratified. For political reasons, the Carter administration did not push for the necessary review of the Covenant by the Senate, which must give its 'advice and consent' before the US can ratify a treaty. The Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations took the view that economic, social, and cultural rights were not really rights but merely desirable social goals and therefore should not be the object of binding treaties. The Clinton Administration did not deny the nature of these rights but did not find it politically expedient to engage in a battle with Congress over the Covenant. The George W. Bush administration followed in line with the view of the previous Bush administration.\" The Obama Administration stated \"The Administration does not seek action at this time\" on the Covenant. The Heritage Foundation, a critical conservative think tank, argues that signing it would obligate the introduction of policies that it opposes such as universal health care.\n\nThe Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights is a side-agreement to the Covenant which allows its parties to recognise the competence of the Committee on Economic Social and Cultural Rights to consider complaints from individuals.\n\nThe Optional Protocol was adopted by the UN General Assembly on 10 December 2008. It was opened for signature on 24 September 2009, and as of February 2013 has been signed by 40 parties and ratified by 22. Having passed the threshold of required ratifications it has entered into force on 5 May 2013.\n\nThe Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights is a body of human rights experts tasked with monitoring the implementation of the Covenant. It consists of 18 independent human rights experts, elected for four-year terms, with half the members elected every two years.\n\nUnlike other human rights monitoring bodies, the Committee was not established by the treaty it oversees. Rather, it was established by the Economic and Social Council following the failure of two previous monitoring bodies.\n\nAll states parties are required to submit regular reports to the Committee outlining the legislative, judicial, policy and other measures they have taken to implement the rights affirmed in the Covenant. The first report is due within two years of ratifying the Covenant; thereafter reports are due every five years. The Committee examines each report and addresses its concerns and recommendations to the State party in the form of \"concluding observations\".\n\nThe Committee typically meets every May and November in Geneva.\n\nThe following are parties to the covenant:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "27981145", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27981145", "title": "Iqta'", "text": "Iqta'\n\nIqta‘ () was an Islamic practice of tax farming that became common in Muslim Asia during the Buyid dynasty. The prominent Orientalist Claude Cahen described the Iqta‘ as follows:\na form of administrative grant, often (wrongly) translated by the European word “fief”. The nature of the iḳṭāʿ varied according to time and place, and a translation borrowed from other systems of institutions and conceptions has served only too often to mislead Western historians, and following them, even those of the East.\n\nUnlike European systems, the Muqtis had no right to interfere with the personal life of a paying person if the person stayed on the Muqti's land. Also, Iqtas were not hereditary by law and had to be confirmed by a higher authority (like the sultan or the king).\n\nAs with other feudal-like tax farming systems, Iqta' evolved from the tribal practices. It originated from the need to secure one's self by paying taxes to the most powerful leader, but later developed into something exchangeable by the landowners like with the fiefdoms of Europe.\n\nThe Buyids codified the already existent system of tax farming. They united the Amirs of Persia and reorganized their land into Iqtas, whose borders remained largely similar to the predecessor states. Contrary to most other forms of Iqta, it was hereditary, but the land was divided when there were more sons of age.\n\nIn the Seljuk Empire, the move toward the iqta' system was facilitated by the Persian bureaucrat Nizam al-Mulk \"who developed and systemized the trend towards feudalism that was already inherent in the tax-farming practices of the immediately preceding period,\" \nIt is made clear that muqtis hold no claim on the peasants/subjects other than that of collecting from them in a proper manner the due land tax that has been assigned to them. When the revenue has been realized from them, those subjects should remain secure from any demands of the muqtis in respect of their persons, wealth, families, lands and goods. The muqtis can't hold any further claims on them. The subjects can go to the King and address their grievances in case they are being subjugated by the muqtis. It is thus clear that the muqtis only hold the land under the king, the land in truth belongs to the Sultan. Nizam al-Mulk emphasizes an important element in the iqta- muqti's right to collect and appropriate taxes.\nOf course, the muqtis also had certain obligations to the Sultan. They had to maintain the troops and furnish them at call. The revenues they got from the iqtas were meant to be resources for him to do the same. The revenue was meant for the muqti's own expenses, payment and maintenance of the troops and the rest had to be sent back to the king. The muqti was thus a tax collector and army paymaster rolled into one.\n\nShamsa ud-din Iltutmish established the \"Iqta‘ system\" based on Mohammad Gori's ideas. It was very close to the original form of Iqta' as its main function was only to collect taxes by Muqtis/Iqtedars in India. They had no other right to the subjects apart from the taxes as long as taxes were paid. The money was used to pay for the landowner's army, which could be called by the Sultan at any time, making up for a relatively quick mobilisation and highly professional soldiers. A small part of the money was to be given to the Sultan, but the percentage was usually insignificant compared to the other expenses. Iqtas were given for exceptional military service or loyalty and were, unlike the original, usually hereditary.\nThe Iqta‘ system was later reorganized by Balban, who divided his empire into small pieces of land and opposed making Iqta hereditary. His absolutist rule concentrated on limiting the power of the estates (mainly the nobility and merchants) and securing his supreme authority as the king. He also dissolved the Council of Forty - Chahalgani, a form of sharing power between the highest nobles and the king. His rule was supported by the strengthened espionage and counter-espionage system and his personal secret police, called \"barids\".\nThe Iqta' system was revived by Firuz Shah Tughlaq of the Tughlaq dynasty, having also made the assignments hereditary to please the nobles.\n\nAlthough there are similarities between the Iqta‘ system and the common fief system practiced in the west at similar periods, there are also considerable differences.\n\nThe Iqta‘ holders generally did not technically own the lands, but only assume the right to the revenue of the land, a right that the government typically reserved the right to change. Many Iqta‘ holders did not hold their Iqta' for life, and at least in most cases they were not subject to inheritance to the next generation.\n\nAlthough the subjects attached to the Iqta‘ were still technically free men, in real practice the end result often end up with them functioning like serfs.\n\nThere are significant variances in the actual implementation of Iqta' systems throughout the different periods and in different area, so it is difficult to completely generalize them.\n\n\n\n"}

The community-based organization serves more than 100,000 clients annually. It is the nation's largest organization exclusively devoted to providing free civil services to the poor, with programs located in low-income neighborhoods throughout New York City.\n\nIn 1967, a group of federally funded legal services offices united to become Community Action for Legal Services (CALS), which later changed to Legal Services for New York City. After adopting a new logo and brand, the organization changed its name in 2007, on its 40th anniversary, to Legal Services NYC (LSNYC). The first landmark win for LSNYC came in 1970 with \"Goldberg v. Kelly\", where the US Supreme Court laid down the due process standards for the termination of government benefits.\n\nThe organization's structure serves New York City's low-income community on the local level. Some of the local units are run from the central office, while others are independent organizations with their own local board of directors. Each borough has its own program: Manhattan Legal Services, Queens Legal Services, Staten Island Legal Services, Bronx Legal Services, and Brooklyn Legal Services. There is also a citywide Central Office and a Legal Support Unit.\n\nThe organization represents clients in courts and administrative proceedings. It also provides advice or referral information if unable to provide representation. Assistance is provided through legal education and community workshops, help lines and written materials. The organization also provides training to poverty law attorneys and advocates through its Legal Support Unit.\n\nLSNYC is governed by a board of directors; the members are appointed by Bar Associations, community groups, and other entities. The board of directors is led by the executive committee, composed of the Chair, Vice Chair, Treasurer and Secretary, and three additional non-officer members of the board.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10601320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10601320", "title": "Metabolife", "text": "Metabolife\n\nMetabolife International, Inc., was a multi-level marketing company based in San Diego, California which manufactured dietary supplements. Metabolife's best-selling product, an ephedra-based supplement called \"Metabolife 356\", once generated hundreds of millions of dollars in annual sales. However, Metabolife 356 and other ephedra-containing supplements were linked to thousands of serious adverse events, including deaths, which caused the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ban the sale of ephedra-containing dietary supplements in 2004.\n\nSubsequently, Metabolife's founder Michael Ellis was convicted of lying to the FDA and concealing evidence of ephedra's dangers, and the company and its owner were both convicted of income tax evasion. A congressional investigation found that Metabolife had received thousands of reports of serious adverse events, many occurring in young and otherwise healthy people, and that Metabolife concealed the reports and acted with \"indifference to the health of consumers.\"\n\nMetabolife was founded in the early 1990s by Michael Ellis, a former police officer on probation for charges relating to his involvement with a methamphetamine lab. Ellis and a boyhood friend, Michael Blevins, were arrested in 1989 for producing and distributing methamphetamine. Both Ellis and Blevins cooperated with federal authorities in return for lighter sentences. Following Blevins' release from prison, the two formed Metabolife to market ephedra, an herbal supplement containing compounds chemically related to methamphetamine. Ellis served as the company's CEO until September 2000, when he was succeeded by David Brown (Brown went on to serve as president and CEO of LifeVantage in 2008).\n\nMetabolife 356, an ephedra supplement manufactured by Chemins, was initially marketed by Metabolife as a bodybuilding supplement, but in 1995 was rebranded as an aid for dieting. The product became highly successful due to a marketing plan that enlisted customers to advertise and sell the supplement; at their peak, sales of Metabolife 356 were in the hundreds of millions of dollars annually. At one point, Metabolife offered the Russian government $15 million to paint its logo on an International Space Station rocket and incorporate Metabolife's ephedra supplement into the diet of its cosmonauts.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the U.S. FDA considered regulating ephedra more strictly, in response to reports of adverse reactions and more than 100 deaths linked to the supplement. These included reports of psychosis, heart attack, stroke, and diabetic ketoacidosis. A clinical trial conducted to address safety concerns found that Metabolife 365 increased blood pressure and induced mild cardiac arrhythmias; the trial concluded that there were serious safety concerns associated with the use of Metabolife.\n\nMetabolife took an active role in lobbying against regulation of ephedra, forming an advocacy group called the Dietary Supplement Safety and Science Coalition and contributing heavily to Congressmen Brian Bilbray (R-Calif.) and Dan Burton (R-Ind.), among other politicians. Bilbray subsequently criticized the FDA's treatment of Metabolife and its efforts to regulate ephedra. During this period in the late 1990s, Metabolife contributed $1.6 million in soft money to both political parties, and almost $3 million to lobbyists. At the state level, Metabolife contributed $10,000 to then-Governor of Texas George W. Bush, who intervened to stop regulation which would have banned over-the-counter sales of ephedra. Bush subsequently returned the $10,000 after Ellis' and Blevins' methamphetamine convictions were publicized in the media. Other recipients of Metabolife contributions included then-Governor of California Joseph Graham 'Gray' Davis, Jr., who was given $175,000.\n\nMetabolife was investigated by the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Justice for income tax evasion; ultimately, the company pleaded guilty to filing fraudulent tax returns and was sentenced to pay a criminal fine of $600,000. Metabolife owner William Bradley also pleaded guilty to evading millions of dollars in taxes and was sentenced to 6 months in federal prison and 2 years of probation.\n\nAccording to federal prosecutors in the case against Metabolife and its executives, the company’s certified public accountant, Michael Compton, knew about and helped conceal Metabolife’s illegal activities. Compton had admitted falsifying tax returns for company executives and was complicit in the company’s failure to account for $93.7 million in income on its income tax returns from 1996 through 1999. Compton had assisted the company in setting up secret offshore bank accounts and trusts in the Cayman Islands and was aware that Bradley, Ellis, and Blevins each had over $1 million in unreported cash concealed in safes within their homes. In July 2002, criminal investigators of the Internal Revenue Service raided Compton's office, seizing documents and computer data, and in November 2003, 10 days after a warrant against Metabolife and its principals was unsealed in U.S. District Court, Compton died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.\n\nSome of the politicians associated with Metabolife also encountered legal difficulties; Texas state legislators Jeff Wentworth and Rick Green were accused of illegal lobbying on behalf of the company.\n\nFollowing the FDA's ban of ephedra, Michael Ellis was indicted on eight counts of making false statements to the FDA in an effort to obstruct regulation of ephedra. Ellis ultimately pled guilty to a single count of lying to the FDA about the adverse effects of Metabolife 356. He was sentenced to 6 months in federal prison and a $20,000 fine.\n\nIn response to falling sales, and facing more than $1 billion in personal injury legal claims related to Metabolife 356, Metabolife filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2005. The company's furnishings and property, including a large collection of artwork, were liquidated in late 2006 to compensate creditors and settle outstanding personal-injury claims.\n\nMetabolife's non-ephedra assets were acquired by Ideasphere Inc., a New York-based dietary-supplement manufacturer, for $12 million in 2007. In 2008, Michael Ellis authored a memoir entitled \"The Metabolife Story: The Rape of Cinderella\", with a testimonial by the former FBI special agent who arrested Ellis in 1989 for producing and distributing methamphetamine.\n\n"}

It divides into five chapters with many articles that developed over several years. The Belgian constitution, like the constitutions of other European states, served as a partial model for the Iranian constitution.\n\nThe electoral and fundamental laws of 1906 established the electoral system and the internal frameworks of the Majlis (Parliament) and the Senate.\n\nBy the royal proclamation of August 5, 1906, Mozzafar al-Din Shah created this first constitution \"for the peace and tranquility of all the people of Persia.\" Muhammad Ali Shah Qajar is credited with chapters 4 and 5.\n\nThe electoral law of September 9, 1906 defined the regulations for the Elections to the Majlis.\n\nArticle 3 of this chapter stated that (1) women, (2) foreigners, (3) those under 25, (4) \"persons notorious for mischievous opinions,\" (5) those with a criminal record, (6) active military personnel, and a few other groups are not permitted to vote.\n\nArticle 4 stated that the elected must be (1) fully literate in Persian, (2) \"they must be Iranian subjects of Iranian extraction,\" (3) \"be locally known,\" (4) \"not be in government employment,\" (5) be between 30 and 70 years old, and (6) \"have some insight into affairs of State.\"\n\nArticle 7 asserted, \"Each elector has one vote and can only vote in one [social] class.\"\n\nThe fundamental laws of December 30, 1906 defined the role of the Majlis in the system and its framework. It further defined a bicameral legislature. Article 1 established the National Consultative Assembly based \"on justice.\" Article 43 stated, \"There shall be constituted another Assembly, entitled the Senate.\"\n\nThe supplementary fundamental laws of October 7, 1907 established the charter of rights and overall system of governance.\n\nThe Supplementary Fundamental Laws of October 7, 1907 consist of ten sections:\n1.

Powers of the Tribunal of Justice\n8. Provincial and Departmental Councils (anjumans)\n9. Concerning the Finances\n10. The Army\n\nThe original Fundamental Law, containing 51 Articles, was promulgated on Dhu’l-Qu’da 14, A.H. 1324 (December 30, 1906) by Muzaffaru’d-Din Shah, who died just 4 days later. The following supplementary laws were ratified by his son and successor Shah Muhammad ‘Ali on Sha’ban 29, A.H. 1325 (October 7, 1907)\n\nArticle 1 and 2 of the laws, established Islam as the official religion of Persia/Iran, and specified that all laws of the nation must be approved by a committee of Shi'a clerics. Later, these two articles were mainly ignored by the Pahlavis, which sometimes resulted in anger and uprising of clerics and religious masses: (See: Pahlavis and non-Islamic policies)\n\nArticles 3-7 under the General Dispositions discuss the logistics of borders, flag specifications and Tehran as the capital of the country. They also elaborate on the property rights of foreign nationals in Iran as well as the inability to suspend the principles of the constitution.\n\nIn the \"Rights of the Persian Nation,\" articles 8-25 discuss an array of rights inherent to all citizens of Iran. These rights include personal and property rights as well as freedom of expression and censorship. They briefly touch on the rights of citizenship and to move freely within the country.\n\nThis section of the Supplementary Fundamental Laws of October 7, 1907 begins by stating the following:\nArticle 27 discussed the three categories that the power of the realm is divided into as:\nThe remaining articles entail a permanent distinction between the three powers as well as their relativity in each province, department and district.\n\nThis section includes the roles of the National Consultative Assembly and the Senate and the stipulations for membership within the two branches of government.\n\nIn the Rights of the Persian Throne, the section begins with several articles outlining the duties of the Shah and the logistics of the throne. These include the process of succession to the throne, ascending to the throne and how to deal with instances issues like death.\n\nIt further discusses the duties of the Shah like the appointment and dismissal of Ministers and The granting of military rank, decoration and other honorary distinctions. The shah also commands the military and has the final say on whether or not to wage war.\n\nThis sections concludes in Article 57 by underlining the precise degree of power that the Shah obtains saying:\nArticles 58-70 comment on the duties and laws regarding the Ministers. This section also helps to establish the specific roles that Ministers play in the government.\n\nSeveral articles talk specifically about how Ministers are appointed as well as how they are held accountable for their delinquencies.\n\nThis section begins by stating the purpose for the Ministry of Justice with article 71:\nArticles 72-82 continue on to discuss the instructions for dealing with public disputes and inquiries as well as the legal aspects of carrying out justice in regards to law violations. Several articles explain the rules for all proceedings of tribunals declaring that they must be public and that all decisions must be based on reason and supported by proof in accordance to the law.\n\nIn articles 83-89, the issue of appointment is addressed and explained in regards to the Public Prosecutor and the members of the judicial tribunals, corroborating with the laws set forth.\n\nThe various Provincial and Departmental Councils are discussed in this section, establishing the special regulations for the different branches.\n\nThe fundamental laws regulating these assemblies includes the election of the members of the provincial and departmental councils, the supervision over all reforms connected with the public advantage, and duties of the expenditure for the individual councils.\n\nThe regulations and management of finances is provided in articles 94-103. These articles include laws regarding taxes, tax exemptions, the set laws regarding the approval of the budget as well as the role of the Financial Commission.\n\nThe Financial Commission's role is: \n\nThe section concludes with the idea that the institution and organization of the Financial Commission must be in accordance with the Law.\n\nThe last section of the Supplementary Fundamental Laws of October 7, 1907 is the Army. This sections outlines all elements of recruitment of troops, the duties and rights of the military, and the promotion of military personnel. It further discusses the budget of the military which is determined by the National Consultative Assembly each year, and rights regarding military personnel.\n\nThe Supplementary Fundamental Laws of October 7, 1907 conclude with the following statements:\n\n\"In the Name of God, blessed and exalted is He.\"\n\n\"The complementary provisions of the Fundamental Code of Laws have been perused and are correct. Please God, our Royal Person will observe and regard all of them. Our sons and successors also will, please God, confirm these sacred laws and principles.\n\nThe Law only says that the laws mustn't be against Islam, but not that the laws have to be Islamic. Laws can indeed be un-Islamic and not be at variance with any specified Islamic law. The Constitutional Revolution had a role in suppressing the power that the clergy and the religion had. The Revolution gave rights to minorities such as Zoroastrians, Christians and Jews.\n\n\n"}

Ivan Timofeyevich Polyukhovich had been charged under the Act with war crimes, alleged to have been committed between September 1942 and May 1943 in the Ukraine while it was under German occupation in World War II.\n\nPolyukhovich's lawyers argued that the law was beyond the scope of Commonwealth legislative power in section 51(vi) (defence) and section 51(xxix) (external affairs) of the Constitution. He further argued that the attempt to make past criminal conduct an offence was an invalid attempt to usurp the judicial power of the Commonwealth, that power being vested by the Constitution in Chapter III courts, by enacting what was effectively a bill of attainder.\n\nBy a majority of 6 to 1 (Brennan J dissenting) the court held that the Act was a valid exercise of the external affairs power. The six majority judges all wrote separate opinions. Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson, Gaudron & McHugh JJ were all of the opinion that as the subject matter of the legislation was external to Australia then the law was a valid one under the external affairs power. Mason CJ also said that if the Parliament considered that Australia had an interest or concern it was not for the court to examine whether there was a relevant interest or concern.\n\nToohey J, however, considered that it was not sufficient that the Act dealt with matters outside Australia. In his opinion, the subject matter had to 'touch and concern' Australia, In the event, he found that there was a sufficient connection between the subject matter of the Act and Australia to allow the law under section 51(xxix).\n\nIn dissent, Brennan J suggested that there must be a nexus between Australia and the 'external affair' involved. He held that, because the subject of war crimes in World War II was not an external affair at the time, i.e., 1939 to 1945, the subsequent acquisition of citizenship or residence in Australia by an individual was not enough to transform the subject matter into an external affair.\n\nIn relation to Polyukhovich's contention that the Act purported to usurp the judicial power of the Chapter III courts, the court held by a majority of 4 to 2 (Brennan J not deciding) that the statute did not invalidly usurp the judicial power of the Commonwealth. While the majority all accepted that a bill of attainder would offend the Commonwealth separation of powers, the fact that a law operated \"ex post facto\" did not automatically make the law a bill of attainder. In addition, an \"ex post facto\" law of the kind under consideration was not a usurpation of judicial power.\n\n\n"}

Nevertheless, a large number of its rules are still seen as essential for the protection of creditors, to attempt to forestall insolvency.\n\n\nThe Directives provisions on freedom of establishment had determined that minimum capital was a disproportionate means to achieve the aim of protecting creditors.

{"id": "16175217", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16175217", "title": "Sperm donation laws by country", "text": "Sperm donation laws by country\n\nSperm donation laws vary by country. Most countries have laws on sperm donation and place limits on how many children a sperm donor may give rise to. Other laws include a prohibition on use of donor semen after the donor has died, or to the payment to sperm donors. Other laws may restrict use of donor sperm for in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment, which may itself be banned or restricted in some way, such as to married heterosexual couples, banning such treatment to single women or lesbian couples. \n\nRestrictions on sperm donations or the ability to obtain IVF treatment in some jurisdictions has given rise to women seeking such donations or treatments traveling to countries which do not impose such restrictions, in a practice called fertility tourism.\n\nMost jurisdictions have laws that limit the number of children a sperm donor may give rise to. The main reason to limit sperm donations is the risk of accidental consanguinity or inbreeding between donor offspring. In some countries such limits are voluntary while in others they are imposed by law. \n\nMost jurisdictions which set limits on the number of sperm donations do so in terms of number of donor offspring, but some jurisdictions set the limits in terms of \"families\", to allow for the children of the recipient woman to be true genetic siblings and because consanguinity issues are caught by a country's incest laws.\n\nMost jurisdictions set only local limits, while a number set worldwide limits. Some jurisdictions permit the export of donor sperms, which may not count in the limit on donor offspring, while the import of donor sperm may be subject to local limits.\n\nIn Victoria, there is a limit of 10 families per donor.\nIn Western Australia, the Human Reproductive Technology Act 1991 (HRT Act) limits the number of families for each donor to 5.\n\nThere is no limit to the number of children born from each donor, however he/she can only donate to a maximum of six families. Before the law was changed in July 2007, a medical practitioner could make his or her own decision on the maximum. In the late 1990s Belgian fertility clinics (or sperm banks) imported large amounts of donor sperm from other countries and this led to Belgium becoming a 'fertility destination'. However, the Belgian Parliament became concerned about this and, along with the promulgation of the Tissues Directive by the European Commission, the Government decided radically to alter the laws relating to maximum numbers.\n\nThere is no upper limit to the number of donor offspring in Canada, but sperm banks generally follow the same recommendations as in the US, i.e. a maximum of 25 offspring per population of 800,000.\n\nThe Assisted Human Reproduction Act banned compensation for sperm donors and imposed a bureaucratic system described as \"cumbersome\" on donors, after which time more than 90% of donor sperm used in Canada comes from the U.S.\n\nIn Denmark, one donor may give rise to 12 children.\n\nHowever, Denmark also exports semen worldwide, and where it is the limit of the importing country that is followed, or, when there is no such limit, a fixed amount considering that country's total population, in order to minimise the risk of consanguinity.\n\nThrough the export it may result in that some single donors have over 100 biological children worldwide who are genetic half-siblings\n\nIn France, donations from a single donor may give rise to six families, but there is no limit to sibling numbers.\n\nSingle women and coupled lesbians are not permitted to have treatment using donor sperm. Women in these categories therefore seek treatment abroad, particularly in Spain, Belgium and Denmark. Before the changes to local laws in Spain and Belgium which restricted the numbers of children permitted to be born from a single donor, these were the preferred fertility destinations and clinics in these countries frequently bought in sperm supplies from abroad to satisfy demand.\n\nLegislation provides that a donor may not produce more than fifteen children through his donations. The legal position surrounding donations to single mothers and lesbians is still awaiting clarification by the courts. At present a donor can run the risk of paternity proceedings if his donations are used in such cases.\n\nIn Israel, sperm donation is mandated by the Ministry of Health. There are 12 authorized sperm banks and hospitals across the country, and 2 more in private research facilities. Only unmarried, healthy men under the age of 30 are allowed to donate sperm, and they are financially compensated for it. Men who want to donate must get to the hospital, pass an interview and blood-checks. They are also prohibited from donating sperm in more than one sperm bank. Finally, anonymity is kept indefinitely; the donor would never receive information regarding offsprings, and vice versa.\n\nIn New Zealand, a voluntary policy law by fertility clinics limit one donor to \"fathering\" a maximum of 10 children to four families.\n\nAround 1996-97, fertility clinics in New Zealand voluntarily agreed they would only accept donations from non-anonymous donors. The Human Assisted Reproductive Technology Act 2004 legislated that all donations made on or after 22 August 2005 must be non-anonymous.\n\nClinics in Norway have a maximum of eight children per donor.\n\nThe law provides that there must not be more than six births per donor. The same law applies to egg donations. Prior to the change in the law in 2008, clinics set their own maximums on the numbers of children produced from each donor. Spain was becoming a destination for fertility tourists, i.e. women seeking to become pregnant through the use of donor sperm and Spanish clinics were purchasing donor sperm from other countries in order to satisfy demand (see Onselling in main article). Many UK women were travelling to Spain at that time to be impregnated with sperm imported from clinics in the UK for example, where there were already controls on the numbers of children which each donor could produce.\n\nThe change in the law in Spain coincided with Europe-wide discussions on the use and export of human cells.\n\nSperm donation is only permitted by anonymous donation. Surrogacy is not allowed.\n\nIn Sweden, a donor may give a child to a maximum of six couples. However, each pair may have a sibling in addition. Thus, the limit is 12 children per donor. Nevertheless, the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare (Socialstyrelsen) recommends a maximum of 6 children per donor.\n\nArtificial insemination by donor was done only if the woman was married or in registered cohabitation, and required written consent of the spouse or partner. This law has now changed allowing single women access to state funded fertility treatment although long waiting lists may prove prohibitive.\n\nIn Switzerland sperm donation is only allowed for married heterosexual couples—not for unmarried couples, singles or homosexual couples. A donor may give rise to a maximum of eight children.\n\nThe HFEA sets a limit of 10 families within the UK which can be created using the gametes of one donor. However, there is no limit to the number of children which may be born to each such family from the same donor. A donor may set a lower limit and may impose conditions on the use of his sperm.\n\nExports of sperm from the UK have to be notified to the HFEA. Donors must give their permission for export. Special permission is required from the HFEA for the export of embryos.\n\nSome clinics export sperm and import vials from clinics abroad. They may also exchange vials to enable them to use samples from a wider pool of donors, but they must ensure that the donor does not produce children for more than ten families within the UK. A donor must meet certain criteria to donate as well as being between 18 and 45 years old.\n\nIn the United States, there are no regulations governing who may engage in sperm donation. Rather, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine and other expert groups (e.g., American Association of Tissue Banks) provide recommendations and guidelines. The ASRM guidelines limit a donor to 25 live births per population area of 850,000, although this is not enforced by law, there is no central tracking, and it has been estimated that only about 40% of births are reported. It is likely that some donors have over one hundred genetic children.\nSome sperm banks impose lower limits; e.g., the Sperm Bank of California has a limit of ten families per donor, and the Rainbow Flag Sperm Bank has a limit of donor children by six different women.\n\n"}

The law overall did not enact any new principals, but its purpose was to justify and simplify the concession laws and overall regulations in Argentina with regard to the railroad industry. It was more of a gesture to foreign investors that had initially invested in building the Argentinian railroad system in the 19th century. The rail industry was very profitable for foreign investors in the 20th century, and the Mitre Law ensured that similar regulations would be continued and thus Argentina hoped for increased investment into their developing economy. it had the effect of an increase in foreign investments in railroads notably from British companies. Since Argentina lacked the iron and coal resources that were essential to an expanding economy during the industrial revolution, the Argentinian government had to offer generous deals with foreign investors because of the lack of such resources. The law permitted all railway companies, and not just foreign owned ones, to import most of their raw materials tax-free.\n\nThe Mitre Law follows similar practices of Liberalism in other Latin American countries, meaning opening their economies to European countries such as Great Britain, and France, also including lower tax rates to promote business growth. The Mitre Law included a clause that ensured that a 3% tax on net profits from the rail industry would go back to rebuilding and maintaining stations across Argentina. Investors however did not like this tax, even though low, it would slow profitability over time.\n\n"}
{"id": "27615956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27615956", "title": "United Federal Workers of America", "text": "United Federal Workers of America\n\nThe United Federal Workers of America (UFWA) was an American labor union representing federal government employees which existed from 1937 to 1946. It was the first union with this jurisdiction established by the Congress of Industrial Organizations (a national labor federation). In 1946 it merged with other unions to form the influential United Public Workers of America. The union challenged the constitutionality of the Hatch Act of 1939, which led to the Supreme Court decision in \"United Public Workers v. Mitchell\", 330 U.S. 75 (1947).\n\nThe union is sometimes confused with the United Public Workers of America, its successor union.\n\nIn 1937, the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) formed a new union for U.S. government employees, the United Federal Workers of America (UFWA), from local unions which had disaffiliated from the American Federation of Labor-affiliated American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE). The UFWA's membership, however, remained static (as did the membership of nearly all federal government unions during the Great Depression of the 1930s, when people were grateful for work.). Much of the UFWA leadership was leftist. The leadership was militant in its advocacy of the rights of its members, and most of the national and local union leadership advocated leftist ideals; associated with left-wing intellectuals, activists, and political people; and supported left-wing organizations. This led many politicians and others to believe the organization was Communist-controlled.\n\nThe political leanings of the UWFA led to passage of two pieces of legislation intended to restrict its political activities. In June 1938, Congress passed a rider to appropriations legislation that prevented the federal government from making payments (such as salaries) to any person or organization which advocated the overthrow of the federal government (as many communist organizations at the time proposed). In 1939, Congress passed the Hatch Act of 1939, which restricted political campaign activities by federal employees. A provision of the Hatch Act made it illegal for the federal government to employ anyone who advocated the overthrow of the federal government. The UFWA hired lawyer Lee Pressman to challenge the constitutionality of the Hatch Act.\n\nOn April 25, 1946, the State, County, and Municipal Workers of America (SCMWA) merged with the UFWA to form the United Public Workers of America. The impetus for the merger was the relative failure of the UFWA to attract new members, and SCMWA essentially absorbed the smaller federal union.\n\nThe union's long-standing lawsuit against the Hatch Act of 1939 finally reached the Supreme Court in 1947. In \"United Public Workers v. Mitchell\", 330 U.S. 75 (1947), the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the Act. Writing for the majority, Associate Justice Stanley Forman Reed argued that the Hatch Act did not infringe on the First Amendment guarantees of free speech and free association but rather on rights guaranteed by the Ninth Amendment (guaranteeing non-enumerated rights to the people) and Tenth Amendment (guaranteeing non-enumerated rights to the states). These rights were not absolute, and could be subordinated to the \"elemental need for order\" without which all rights ceased to function. Additionally, the non-enumerated rights of the Ninth and Tenth Amendments were subordinate to the enumerated rights granted to the federal government by the Constitution. \n\nReed upheld the Hatch Act as a legitimate exercise of the enumerated rights of the federal government. The decision in \"United Public Workers v. Mitchell\" relied heavily on the \"doctrine of privilege,\" a legal doctrine that held that public employment was a privilege (not a right) and subsequently significant restrictions could be placed on public employees that could not be constitutionally tolerated in the private sector. \"United Public Workers v. Mitchell\" proved to be the last gasp of the doctrine of privilege. \n\nThe Supreme Court explicitly rejected the doctrine in \"Wieman v. Updegraff\", 344 U.S. 183 (1952). A broad number of high court decisions in areas such as nonpartisan speech, due process, search and seizure, the right to marry, the right to bear children, equal protection, education, and receipt of public benefits over the next two decades continued to undermine the doctrine. Although the Supreme Court later reaffirmed \"Mitchell\" in 1973 in \"Civil Service Comm'n v. Letter Carriers\", 413 U.S. 548 (1973), it did so on the grounds that permitting public employees to engage in political activity was dangerous.\n\n\n"}
