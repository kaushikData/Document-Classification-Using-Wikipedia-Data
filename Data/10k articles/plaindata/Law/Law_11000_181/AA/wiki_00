An increasing number of diverse societies have been changed to free-market structure, leading to displacement. As this expansion has occurred, market-governed regulation has outrun the grasps of the state. Opponents of corporate globalization hold that the government needs greater power to control the markets, that income inequality is increasing, and that corporations have gained too much power. As part of the political left, activists against corporate power and influence support a decreased income gap and improved economical equity.\n\nThe defenders of corporations such as Ron Arnold highlight that governments do legislate in ways that restrict the actions of corporations (see Sarbanes-Oxley Act) and that lawbreaking companies and executives are routinely caught and punished, usually in the form of monetary fines.\n\nIn addition, from the perspective of business ethics it might be argued that chief executives are not inherently more evil than anyone else and so are no more likely to attempt unethical or illegal activity than the general population. Large multi-national corporations do continue to attempt to erode governmental regulations through in-house or contracted lobbyists who work closely with State and Federal legislators. So as corporate laws continue to lean in their favor, corporate members have improved portals to drive up company profits.\n\nAnti-corporate activists may often ally themselves with other activists, such as environmental activists or animal-rights activists in their condemnation of the practices of modern organizations such as the McDonald's Corporation (see McLibel) and forestry company Gunns Limited (see Gunns 20).\n\nIn recent years, there have been an increasing number of books (Naomi Klein's 2000 \"No Logo\" being a well-known example) and films such as \"The Corporation\" which have to a certain extent supported anti-corporate politics.\n\nAn artist critical of sociopolitical agendas in business is conceptualist Hans Haacke.\n\nIn June 2008, Cond√© Nast Publications released an article entitled \"The Secret Seven\" which it listed the top seven anti-corporate web sites which include: WikiLeaks, Mini-Microsoft, Wal-Mart Watch, HomeOwners for Better Building, Brenda Priddy and Company (automotive spy photos) and finally Apple Rumor Sites AppleInsider and MacRumors.\n\nMedia and digital networking have become important features of modern anti-corporate movements. The speed, flexibility, and ability to reach a massive potential audience has provided a technological foundation for contemporary network social movement structure. As a result, communities and interpersonal connections have transformed. The internet supports and strengthens local ties, but also facilitates new patterns for political activity. Activists have used this medium to operate between both the online and offline political spectrums.\n\nEmail lists, web pages, and open editing software have allowed for changes in organization. Now, actions are planned, information is shared, documents are produced by multiple people, and all of this can be done despite differences in distance. This has led to increased growth in digital collaboration. Activists can presently build ties between diverse topics, open the distribution of information, decentralize and increase collaboration, and self-direct networks.\n\nClose to fifty thousand people protested the WTO meetings in Seattle on November 30, 1999. Labor, economic, and environmental activists succeeded in disrupting and closing the meetings due to their disapproval of corporate globalization. This event became a symbol as anti-globalization networks emerged and became strengthened.\nThe experiences from the protests were distributed throughout the internet via emails and websites. Anti-corporate globalization movements have also expanded through the organization of mass mobilizations, including the anti-WTO protests, which were remarkably successful. In the United States, these movements reemerged after less attention was given to the war in Iraq, resulting in an increase in mass mobilizations.\n\n\n"}

It prescribed the arrest of a person, who having entered and professed some religious order (such as a monk), broke from his cloister, contrary to the rules of his order.\n\n"}
{"id": "14105596", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14105596", "title": "Badge of shame", "text": "Badge of shame\n\nA badge of shame, also a symbol of shame, mark of shame or stigma, is typically a distinctive symbol required to be worn by a specific group or an individual for the purpose of public humiliation, ostracism or persecution.\n\nThe term is also used metaphorically, especially in a pejorative sense, to characterize something associated with a person or group as shameful.\n\nIn England, under the Poor Act 1697, paupers in receipt of parish relief were required to wear a badge of blue or red cloth on the shoulder of the right sleeve in an open and visible manner, in order to discourage people from collecting relief unless they were desperate, as while many would be willing to collect relief, few would be willing to do so if required to wear the \"shameful\" mark of the poor in public.\n\nThe yellow badge that Jews were required to wear in parts of Europe during the Middle Ages, and later in Nazi Germany and German-occupied Europe, was effectively a badge of shame, as well as identification. Other identifying marks may include making shamed people go barefoot. \n\nThe biblical \"Mark of Cain\" can be interpreted as synonymous with a badge of shame.\n\nPunitive depilation of men, especially burning off pubic hair, was intended as a mark of shame in ancient Mediterranean cultures where male body hair was valued. Women who committed adultery have also been forced to wear specific icons or marks, or had their hair shorn, as a badge of shame. Many women who fraternized with the occupiers in German-occupied Europe had their heads shaved by angry mobs of their peers after liberation by the Allies of World War II.\n\nDuring World War II, the Nazis also used head shaving as a mark of shame to punish Germans like the youthful non-conformists known as the Edelweiss Pirates.\n\nIn Ancient Rome, both men and women originally wore the toga, but over time matrons adopted the stola as the preferred form of dress, while prostitutes retained the toga. Later, under the Lex Julia, women convicted of prostitution were forced to wear a \"toga muliebris\", as the prostitute's badge of shame.\n\nAt the beginning of the 13th century, Pope Innocent III prohibited Christians from causing Jews bodily harm, but supported their segregation in society. On at least one occasion he likened this to the fate of Cain described in the Book of Genesis, writing to the Count of Nevers:\n\nAfter Innocent III later presided over the Fourth Council of the Lateran in 1215,\nthe council adopted canon 68, requiring Jews (and Muslims) to dress distinctively to prevent interfaith relations.\n\nThis canon was largely ignored by the secular governments of Europe until 1269 when King Louis IX of France, later Saint Louis, was persuaded to decree that French Jews must wear a round yellow badge on their breast and back.\nAfter the Albigensian Crusade ended in 1229, the subsequent Papal inquisition of Pope Gregory IX imposed the ecclesiastical penance of the Cathar yellow cross as a badge of shame to be worn by the remaining repentant Cathars convicted of heresy.\n\nIn colonial New England during the 17th and 18th centuries, courts required people convicted of sexual immorality to wear the letter \"A\" or letters \"AD\" for adultery and the letter \"I\" for incest on their clothing.\n\nStriped prison uniforms were commonly used in the 19th century, as a way to instantly mark an escaping convict. Modern orange prison uniforms serve the same purpose, only with a highly visible bright color to make it difficult to hide. Stripes were adopted as simple one-color uniforms could easily be dyed to another color; dying a striped uniform cannot hide the stripes. They were temporarily abolished in the United States early in the 20th century because their use as a badge of shame was considered undesirable as they were causing constant embarrassment and exasperation to the prisoners. They came back to usage as the public viewpoint changed. In many of today's jails and prisons in the United States the inmates are forced to wear striped prison uniforms. A prominent example is Maricopa County Jail under the administration of Joe Arpaio, where black and white stripes are used. Another predominantly used color scheme consists of orange and white stripes. A person wearing this kind of clothing is distinctly marked and can unmistakably be identified as a prison inmate from a far distance, which allows citizens to instantly identify escapees and notify the authorities.\n\nSocieties have marked people directly in the practice generally known as being \"branded a criminal\". Criminals and slaves have been marked with tattoos. Sexual immorality in colonial New England was also punished by human branding with a hot iron, by having the marks burned into the skin of the face or forehead for all to see.\n\nThe practice of human branding with visible marks on the face had been firmly established by King Edward VI of England under the 1547 \"Statute of Vagabonds\", which specified the burning of the letter \"S\" on the cheek or forehead of an escaped slave, and the letter \"F\" for \"fraymaker\" on the cheek of a church brawler.\n\nJames Nayler, an English Quaker convicted of blasphemy in 1656, was famously branded with a \"B\" on his forehead.\nThe practice of human branding was abolished in England by 1829. It continued in the United States until at least 1864, during the American Civil War, where some deserters from the Union Army had their face branded with the letter \"D\" as a mark of shame intended to discourage others. Runaway slaves could be branded with an \"R\" for \"runaway\", which had the effect of ensuring he or she was watched closely and often prejudiced against by any subsequent owners and overseers.\n\nIn old-fashioned French schoolrooms, misbehaving students were sent to sit in a corner of the room wearing a sign that said \"√Çne\", meaning donkey, and were forced to wear a jester's cap with donkey's ears, sometimes conical in shape, known as a \"bonnet d'√¢ne\", meaning \"donkey's cap\". In traditional British and American schoolrooms, the tall conical \"dunce cap\", often marked with the letter \"D\", was used as the badge of shame for disfavored students. The dunce cap is no longer used in modern education, although other forms of shame are still used to punish students. Individuals accused of being counter-revolutionaries were publicly humiliated by being forced to wear dunce caps with their \"crimes\" written on them during the Cultural Revolution.\n\nIn former times prisoners were routinely divested of large parts of their clothing and hereby left with usually covered body parts exposed. This was primarily done to visually earmark the captive individuals so onlookers could distinguish their status upon first sight. It also had a symbolistic connotation in those divesting prisoners of their clothes meant divesting them of their rights and social status.<br>\nNotably taking away the footwear of an unfree person and thereby forcing him or her to remain in bare feet has been used for visibly marking captives, prisoners and slaves in almost every culture. This customary practice is still commonplace in prisons of many countries.\n\nAs shoes in their various appearances have been worn throughout all social classes since earliest human history, forcibly presenting a person to the public in bare feet is a common method to showcase a person's loss of status or absence of rights. As bare feet are a highly noticeable visual attribute in almost every social situation, this particular form of appearance often incidentally raises suspicion or disdain among bystanders.\n\nIt also serves to dishearten prisoners and frustrate attempts of escape. The ability to walk or run quickly is hereby often drastically reduced.\nAs the feet are the only body part with near permanent contact to the environment, their lack of protection can have a victimizing effect and make the person feel physically defeated, helpless or vulnerable which adds to the shaming effect.\n\nWearing shoes is a low-level and natural manifestation of civil rights and liberties, which cannot be revoked from free citizens of any culture under normal circumstances. Even when suffering neediness in ancient history, simple forms of footwear were handmade from available materials, while today simple shoes are sufficiently inexpensive to be purchased in practically every part of the world.<br>\nForcing a subdued person to go barefoot is therefore used to showcase his or her deprivation of the most basic rights and natural liberties. It hereby displays the subjugation of the person under individuals with sufficient authority to impose and enforce certain living conditions. By abiding it also establishes that the person does not have the self-determination, means or power to resist.<br>\nForcing individuals to remain barefoot against their will is, therefore, a common method to display and exercise authority and showcase the flagrant disproportion of power usually found in situations of imprisonment. Exploiting the effects it is often used to intimidate captives or prisoners and cut their self-confidence.\n\nPresenting a prisoner to the public in restraints (such as handcuffs, shackles, chains or similar devices) has always served as a method of shaming the person as well. In addition to their practical use of preventing movement and escape, they are usually uncomfortable to wear and often lock the body in unnatural positions. Especially restraining the hands of a captive behind his or her back is perceived as particularly shameful, as it renders the person practically defenceless and showcases his or her physical defeat to onlookers. The effect is often multiplied by combining means of marking people such as the use of prison uniforms or similar clothing like penitential garbs and the exposure of bare feet.\n\nNazi concentration camp badges of shame were triangular and color-coded to classify prisoners by reason for detention, and Jews wore two triangles in the shape of the six-pointed Star of David. These symbols, intended by the Nazis to be marks of shame, had opposite meanings after World War¬†II: the triangle symbols were used on memorials to those killed in the concentration camps, the pink triangle that homosexual prisoners were required to wear became a symbol of gay pride,\nand the Zionists' Star of David, also co-opted for the Nazi version of the yellow badge, was subsequently featured prominently on the flag of Israel.\n\nConversely, symbols intended to have positive connotations can have unintended consequences. After World War I, the U.S. War Department awarded gold chevrons to soldiers serving in the combat zones in Europe. The silver chevrons awarded for honorable domestic service in support of the war effort were instead considered a badge of shame by many recipients.\n\nIn April 1945 the government of Czechoslovakia ordered the expropriation, denaturalisation and ensuing deportation of all Czechoslovaks of Magyar or German native language. In May 1945 Czechoslovaks of German native language had to wear white or yellow armbands with a capital N, for \"Nƒõmec\" (German), printed on. The armbands were to be worn on the outside clothes until finally, the government had deported all its citizens of German native language, by 1947.\n\nMore recently, in 2007, the Bangkok, Thailand police switched to punitive pink armbands adorned with the cute Hello Kitty cartoon character when the tartan armbands that had been intended to be worn as a badge of shame for minor infractions were instead treated as collectibles by offending officers forced to wear them, creating a perverse incentive. The revised scheme, however, was also soon abandoned.\n\nIn Nathaniel Hawthorne's classic 1850 romance novel \"The Scarlet Letter\", set in 17th century Puritan Boston, the lead character Hester Prynne is led from the town prison with the scarlet letter \"A\" on her breast. The scarlet letter \"A\" represents the act of adultery that she had committed and it is to be a symbol of her sin for all to see. Originally intended as a badge of shame, it would later take on different meanings as her fictional life progressed in the story.\n\nThe 1916 silent film \"The Yellow Passport\", starring Clara Kimball Young, was also known as \"The Badge of Shame\" when it was reissued in 1917.\n\nIn the 2006 film, \"\", Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) is seen using as a fireplace poker, a branding iron with the letter \"P\" that he used to impart the \"pirate's brand\" seen on the right forearm of Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). According to the backstory, Sparrow was branded a pirate by Beckett for refusing to transport slaves for the East India Trading Company.\n\nIn the film \"Inglourious Basterds\" the protagonists carve swastikas into the foreheads of surviving German soldiers, to make their malfeasance known to all in the future.\n\n"}

{"id": "61610", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61610", "title": "Burden of proof (law)", "text": "Burden of proof (law)\n\nThe burden of proof () is the obligation of a party in a trial to produce the evidence that will prove the claims they have made against the other party. In a legal dispute, one party is initially presumed to be correct and gets the benefit of the doubt, while the other side bears the burden of proof. When a party bearing the burden of proof meets its burden, the burden of proof switches to the other side. Burdens may be of different kinds for each party, in different phases of litigation. The burden of production is a minimal burden to produce at least enough evidence for the trier of fact to \"consider\" a disputed claim. After litigants have met the burden of production and their claim is being considered by a trier of fact, they have the burden of persuasion, that enough evidence has been presented to persuade the trier of fact that their side is correct. There are different \"standards\" of persuasiveness ranging from a preponderance of the evidence, where there is just enough evidence to tip the balance, to proof beyond a reasonable doubt, as in United States criminal courts.\n\nThe burden of proof is always on the person who brings a claim in a dispute. It is often associated with the Latin maxim \"semper necessitas probandi incumbit ei qui agit\", a translation of which in this context is: \"the necessity of proof always lies with the person who lays charges.\"\n\nThe party that does not carry the burden of proof carries the benefit of assumption of being correct, they are presumed to be correct, until the burden shifts after presentation of evidence by the party bringing the action. An example is in an American criminal case, where there is a presumption of innocence by the defendant. Fulfilling the burden of proof effectively captures the benefit of assumption, passing the burden of proof off to another party.\n\nThe term \"burden of proof\" is used to mean two kinds of burdens: The burden of production (or the burden of \"going forward with the evidence\") and the burden of persuasion.\n\nA \"burden of persuasion\" or \"risk of nonpersuasion\" is an obligation that remains on a single party for the duration of the court proceeding. Once the burden has been entirely discharged to the satisfaction of the trier of fact, the party carrying the burden will succeed in its claim. For example, the presumption of innocence in a criminal case places a legal burden upon the prosecution to prove all elements of the offense (generally beyond a reasonable doubt), and to disprove all the defenses except for affirmative defenses in which the proof of non-existence of all affirmative defense(s) is not constitutionally required of the prosecution.\n\nThe burden of persuasion should not be confused with the evidential burden, or burden of production, or duty of producing (or going forward with evidence) which is an obligation that may shift between parties over the course of the hearing or trial. The evidential burden is the burden to adduce sufficient evidence to properly raise an issue at court.\n\nBurden of proof refers most generally to the obligation of a party to prove its allegations at trial. In a civil case, the plaintiff sets forth its allegations in a complaint, petition or other pleading. The defendant is then required to file a responsive pleading denying some or all of the allegations and setting forth any affirmative facts in defense. Each party has the burden of proof of its allegations.\n\nPer \"\" (1985), in order to take away a prisoner's for a disciplinary violation, prison officials need only have \"some evidence,\" i.e., \"a modicum of evidence\".\n\nPer \"\" (1960), the some evidence standard is required to overrule a jury's finding of guilt in criminal cases.\n\n\"Reasonable indication is substantially lower than probable cause; factors to consider are those facts and circumstances a prudent investigator would consider, but must include facts or circumstances indicating a past, current, or impending violation; an objective factual basis must be present, a mere 'hunch' is insufficient.\"\n\nThe reasonable indication standard is used in interpreting trade law in determining if the United States has been materially injured.\n\nReasonable suspicion is a low standard of proof to determine whether a \"brief\" investigative stop or search by a police officer or any government agent is warranted. It is important to note that this stop or search must be brief; its thoroughness is proportional to, and limited by, the low standard of evidence. A more definite standard of proof (often probable cause) would be required to justify a more thorough stop/search. In \"Terry v. Ohio\", , the Supreme Court ruled that reasonable suspicion requires specific, articulable, and individualized suspicion that crime is afoot. A mere guess or \"hunch\" is not enough to constitute reasonable suspicion.\n\nAn investigatory stop is a seizure under the Fourth Amendment. The state must justify the seizure by showing that the officer conducting the stop had a reasonable articulable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot. The important point is that officers cannot deprive a citizen of liberty unless the officer can point to specific facts and circumstances and inferences therefrom that would amount to a reasonable suspicion. The officer must be prepared to establish that criminal activity was a logical explanation for what he perceived. The requirement serves to prevent officers from stopping individuals based merely on hunches or unfounded suspicions. The purpose of the stop and detention is to investigate to the extent necessary to confirm or dispel the original suspicion. If the initial confrontation with the person stopped dispels suspicion of criminal activity the officer must end the detention and allow the person to go about his or her business. If the investigation confirms the officer's initial suspicion or reveals evidence that would justify continued detention the officer may require the person detained to remain at the scene until further investigation is complete.\n\nIn \"Arizona v. Gant\" (2009), the United States Supreme Court defined a new standard, that of \"reasonable to believe.\" This standard applies only to vehicle searches after the suspect has been placed under arrest. The Court overruled \"New York v. Belton\" (1981) and concluded that police officers are allowed to go back and search a vehicle incident to a suspect's arrest only where it is \"reasonable to believe\" that there is more evidence in the vehicle of the crime for which the suspect was arrested.\n\nThere is still an ongoing debate as to the exact meaning of this phrase. Some courts have said it should be a new standard while others have equated it with the \"reasonable suspicion\" of the \"Terry\" stop. Most courts have agreed it is somewhere less than probable cause.\n\nProbable cause is a relatively low standard of proof, which is used in the United States to determine whether a search, or an arrest, is warranted. It is also used by grand juries to determine whether to issue an indictment. In the civil context, this standard is often used where plaintiffs are seeking a prejudgement remedy.\n\nIn the criminal context, the U.S. Supreme Court in \"United States v. Sokolow\", , determined that probable cause requires \"a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found\" in deciding whether Drug Enforcement Administration agents had a reason to execute a search. Courts vary when determining what constitutes a \"fair probability\": some say 30%, others 40%, others 51%.\n\nA good illustration of this evidence/intrusiveness continuum might be a typical police/citizen interaction. Consider the following three interactions:\n\nOne of the least reliable standards of proof, this assessment is often used in administrative law, and often in Child Protective Services (CPS) proceedings in some states. The \"some credible evidence\" standard is used as a legal placeholder to bring some controversy before a trier of fact, and into a legal process. It is on the order of the factual standard of proof needed to achieve a finding of \"probable cause\" used in ex parte threshold determinations needed before a court will issue a search warrant. It is a lower standard of proof than the \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard. The standard does not require the fact-finder to weigh conflicting evidence, and merely requires the investigator or prosecutor to present the bare minimum of material credible evidence to support the allegations against the subject, or in support of the allegation; see \"Valmonte v. Bane,\" 18 F.3d 992 (2nd Cir. 1994). In some Federal Appellate Circuit Courts, such as the Second Circuit, the \"some credible evidence\" standard has been found constitutionally insufficient to protect liberty interests of the parties in controversy at CPS hearings.\n\nIn some appeals from decisions of administrative agencies, the courts apply a \"substantial evidence\" standard of review of the agency's factual findings. In the United States, for example, if a Social Security Disability Insurance claimant is found \"not disabled\" (and, therefore, ineligible for benefits) by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) and the claimant appeals, both the Appeals Council (the body within the Social Security Administration that hears appeals from decisions of ALJs) and the Federal courts (which, in this type of case, will normally hear an appeal only after the claimant has exhausted all administrative remedies) will look to see whether the administrative law judge's decision was supported by \"substantial evidence\" or not. Substantial evidence is \"more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\"\n\nThis applies to other court decisions. The trier of fact's decision cannot be baseless.\nPreponderance of the evidence, also known as balance of probabilities, is the standard required in most civil cases and in family court determinations solely involving money, such as child support under the Child Support Standards Act. It is also the burden of proof of which the defendant must prove affirmative defenses or mitigating circumstances in civil or criminal court. In civil court, aggravating circumstances also only have to be proven by a preponderance of the evidence, as opposed to beyond reasonable doubt (as they do in criminal court).\n\nThe standard is met if the proposition is more likely to be true than not true. The standard is satisfied if there is greater than fifty percent chance that the proposition is true. Lord Denning, in \"Miller v. Minister of Pensions\", described it simply as \"more probable than not.\" Until 1970, this was also the standard used in juvenile court in the United States.\n\nThis is also the standard of proof used when determining eligibility of unemployment benefits for a former employee accused of losing the job through alleged misconduct. In most US states, the employer must prove this case with a preponderance of evidence.\n\nPreponderance of the evidence is the standard of proof used for immunity from prosecution under Florida's controversial stand-your-ground law. The defense must present its evidence in a pre-trial hearing, show that the statutory prerequisites have been met, and then request that the court grant a motion for declaration of immunity. The judge must then decide from the preponderance of the evidence whether to grant immunity. This is a far lower burden than \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" the threshold a prosecutor must meet at any proceeding criminal trial, but higher than the \"probable cause\" threshold generally required for indictment.\n\nClear and convincing evidence is a higher level of burden of persuasion than \"preponderance of the evidence\". It is employed intra-adjudicatively in administrative court determinations, as well as in civil and certain criminal procedure in the United States. For example, a prisoner seeking \"habeas corpus\" relief from capital punishment must prove his factual innocence by clear and convincing evidence.\n\nThis standard is used in many types of equity cases, including paternity, persons in need of supervision, juvenile delinquency, child custody, the probate of both wills and living wills, petitions to remove a person from life support (\"right to die\" cases), and many similar cases.\n\nClear and convincing proof means that the evidence presented by a party during the trial must be highly and substantially more probable to be true than not and the trier of fact must have a firm belief or conviction in its factuality. In this standard, a greater degree of believability must be met than the common standard of proof in civil actions, which only requires that the facts as a threshold be more likely than not to prove the issue for which they are asserted.\n\nThis standard is also known as \"clear, convincing, and satisfactory evidence\"; \"clear, cognizant, and convincing evidence\"; and \"clear, unequivocal, satisfactory, and convincing evidence\", and is applied in cases or situations involving an equitable remedy or where a presumptive civil liberty interest exists.\n\nThis is the highest standard used as the burden of proof in Anglo-American jurisprudence and typically only applies in criminal proceedings and when considering aggravating circumstances in criminal proceedings. It has been described, in negative terms, as a proof having been met if there is no plausible reason to believe otherwise. If there is a real doubt, based upon reason and common sense after careful and impartial consideration of all the evidence, or lack of evidence, in a case, then the level of proof has not been met.\n\nProof beyond a reasonable doubt, therefore, is proof of such a convincing character that one would be willing to rely and act upon it without hesitation in the most important of one's own affairs. However, it does not mean an absolute certainty. The standard that must be met by the prosecution's evidence in a criminal prosecution is that no other logical explanation can be derived from the facts except that the defendant committed the crime, thereby overcoming the presumption that a person is innocent unless and until proven guilty.\n\nIf the trier of fact has no doubt as to the defendant's guilt, or if their only doubts are unreasonable doubts, then the prosecutor has proved the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and the defendant should be pronounced guilty.\n\nThe term connotes that evidence establishes a particular point to a moral certainty which precludes the existence of any reasonable alternatives. It does not mean that no doubt exists as to the accused's guilt, but only that no \"reasonable\" doubt is possible from the evidence presented. Further to this notion of moral certainty, where the trier of fact relies on proof that is solely circumstantial, \"i.e.\", when conviction is based entirely on circumstantial evidence, certain jurisdictions specifically require the prosecution's burden of proof to be such that the facts proved must exclude to a moral certainty every reasonable hypothesis or inference other than guilt.\n\nThe main reason that this high level of proof is demanded in criminal trials is that such proceedings can result in the deprivation of a defendant's liberty or even in his or her death. These outcomes are far more severe than in civil trials, in which monetary damages are the common remedy.\n\nAnother noncriminal instance in which proof beyond a reasonable doubt is applied is LPS conservatorship.\n\nIn the three jurisdictions of the UK (Northern Ireland; England & Wales; and Scotland) there are only two standards of proof in trials. (There are others which are defined in statutes, such as those relating to police powers.)\n\nThe criminal standard was formerly described as \"beyond reasonable doubt\". That standard remains, and the words commonly used, though the Judicial Studies Board guidance is that juries might be assisted by being told that to convict they must be persuaded \"so that you are sure\".\n\nThe civil standard is 'the balance of probabilities', often referred to in judgments as \"more likely than not\".\n\nThe civil standard is also used in criminal trials in relation to those defences which must be proven by the defendant (for example, the statutory defence to drunk in charge that there was no likelihood of the accused driving while still over the alcohol limit). However, where the law does not stipulate a reverse burden of proof, the defendant need only raise the issue and it is then for the prosecution to negate the defence to the criminal standard in the usual way (for example, that of self-defence).\n\nPrior to the decision of the House of Lords in \"Re B (A Child)\" [2008] UKHL 35 there had been some confusion ‚Äì even at the Court of Appeal ‚Äì as to whether there was some intermediate standard, described as the 'heightened standard'. The House of Lords found that there was not. As the above description of the American system shows, anxiety by judges to make decisions on very serious matters on the basis of the balance of probabilities had led to a departure from the common law principles of just two standards. Baroness Hale said:\n\nThe task for the tribunal then when faced with serious allegations is to recognise that their seriousness generally means they are inherently unlikely, such that to be satisfied that a fact is more likely than not the evidence must be of a good quality. But the standard of proof remains 'the balance of probabilities'.\n\nThe \"air of reality\" is a standard of proof used in Canada to determine whether a criminal defense may be used. The test asks whether a defense can be successful if it is assumed that all the claimed facts are to be true. In most cases, the burden of proof rests solely on the prosecution, negating the need for a defense of this kind. However, when exceptions arise and the burden of proof has been shifted to the defendant, they are required to establish a defense that bears an \"air of reality.\" Two instances in which such a case might arise are, first, when a \"prima facie\" case has been made against the defendant or, second, when the defense mounts an affirmative defense, such as the insanity defense.\n\nDepending on the legal venue or intra-case hearing, varying levels of reliability of proof are considered dispositive of the inquiry being entertained. If the subject threshold level of reliability has been met by the presentation of the evidence, then the thing is considered legally proved for that trial, hearing or inquest. For example, in California, several evidentiary presumptions are codified, including a presumption that the owner of legal title is the beneficial owner (rebuttable only by clear and convincing evidence).\n\nIn the West, criminal cases usually place the burden of proof on the prosecutor (expressed in the Latin brocard ei incumbit probatio qui dicit, non qui negat, \"the burden of proof rests on who asserts, not on who denies\"). This principle is known as the presumption of innocence, and is summed up with \"innocent until proven guilty,\" but is not upheld in all legal systems or jurisdictions. Where it is upheld, the accused will be found not guilty if this burden of proof is not sufficiently shown by the prosecution.\n\nThe presumption of innocence means three things:\n\nFor example, if the defendant (D) is charged with murder, the prosecutor (P) bears the burden of proof to show the jury that D did indeed murder someone.\n\nHowever, in England and Wales, the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980, s.101 stipulates that where a defendant relies on some \"exception, exemption, proviso, excuse or qualification\" in his defence, the legal burden of proof as to that exception falls on the defendant, though only on the balance of probabilities. For example, a person charged with being drunk in charge of a motor vehicle can raise the defence that there was no likelihood of his driving while drunk. The prosecution has the legal burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant exceeded the legal limit of alcohol and was in control of a motor vehicle. Possession of the keys is usually sufficient to prove control, even if the defendant is not in the vehicle and is perhaps in a nearby bar. That being proved, the defendant has the legal burden of proof on the balance of probabilities that he was not likely to drive.\n\nIn 2002, such practice in England and Wales was challenged as contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), art.6(2) guaranteeing right to a fair trial. The House of Lords held that:\n\nIn some cases, there is a reverse onus on the accused. A typical example is that of a hit-and-run charge prosecuted under the Canadian \"Criminal Code\". The defendant is presumed to have fled the scene of a crash, to avoid civil or criminal liability, if the prosecution can prove the remaining essential elements of the offence.\n\nIn civil law cases, the \"burden of proof\" requires the plaintiff to convince the trier of fact (whether judge or jury) of the plaintiff's entitlement to the relief sought. This means that the plaintiff must prove each element of the claim, or cause of action, in order to recover. However, in cases of proving loss of future earning capacity, the plaintiff must prove there is a real or substantial possibility of such a loss occurring.\n\nIn \"Keyes v. Sch. Dist. No. 1\", , the United States Supreme Court stated: \"There are no hard-and-fast standards governing the allocation of the burden of proof in every situation. The issue, rather, 'is merely a question of policy and fairness based on experience in the different situations.'\" For support, the Court cited 9 John H. Wigmore, Evidence ¬ß 2486, at 275 (3d ed. 1940). In \"Keyes\", the Supreme Court held that if \"school authorities have been found to have practised purposeful segregation in part of a school system,\" the burden of persuasion shifts to the school to prove that it did not engage in such discrimination in other segregated schools in the same system.\n\nIn \"Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs v. Greenwich Collieries\", , the Supreme Court explained that \"burden of proof\" is ambiguous because it has historically referred to two distinct burdens: the \"burden of persuasion\", and the \"burden of production\".\n\nThe Supreme Court discussed how courts should allocate the burden of proof (i.e., the burden of persuasion) in \"Schaffer ex rel. Schaffer v. Weast\", . The Supreme Court explained that if a statute is silent about the burden of persuasion, the court will \"begin with the ordinary default rule that plaintiffs bear the risk of failing to prove their claims.\" In support of this proposition, the Court cited 2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence ¬ß 337, 412 (5th ed. 1999), which states:\n\nAt the same time, the Supreme Court also recognized \"The ordinary default rule, of course, admits of exceptions. ... For example, the burden of persuasion as to certain elements of a plaintiff's claim may be shifted to defendants, when such elements can fairly be characterized as affirmative defenses or exemptions. See, e.g., \"FTC v. Morton Salt Co.\", 334 U.S. 37, 44-45 (1948). Under some circumstances this Court has even placed the burden of persuasion over an entire claim on the defendant. See \"Alaska Dept. of Environmental Conservation v. EPA\", .\" Nonetheless, \"[a]bsent some reason to believe that Congress intended otherwise, therefore, [the Supreme Court] will conclude that the burden of persuasion lies where it usually falls, upon the party seeking relief.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "95356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=95356", "title": "Coroner", "text": "Coroner\n\nA coroner may conduct or order an inquest into the manner or cause of death, and investigate or confirm the identity of an unknown person who has been found dead within the coroner's jurisdiction.\n\nIn medieval times, English coroners were Crown officials who held financial powers and conducted some judicial investigations in order to counterbalance the power of sheriffs.\n\nThe word \"coroner\" derives from the same source as the word \"crown\", and it is believed to denote an officer of The Crown.\n\nResponsibilities of the coroner may include overseeing the investigation and certification of deaths related to mass disasters that occur within the coroner's jurisdiction. A coroner's office typically maintains death records of those who have died within the coroner's jurisdiction.\n\nDepending on the jurisdiction, the coroner may adjudge the cause of death personally, or may act as the presiding officer of a special court (a \"coroner's jury\"). The office of coroner originated in medieval England and has been adopted in many countries whose legal systems have at some time been subject to English or United Kingdom law. The additional roles that a coroner may oversee in judicial investigations may be subject to the attainment of suitable legal and medical qualifications. The qualifications required of a coroner vary significantly between jurisdictions, and are described under the entry for each jurisdiction.\nCoroners, medical examiners, and forensic pathologists are different professions. They have different roles and responsibilities.\n\nIn Middle English, the word \"coroner\" referred to an officer of The Crown, derived from the French \"couronne\" and Latin \"corona\", meaning \"crown\".\n\nThe office of the coroner dates from approximately the 11th century, shortly after the Norman conquest of England in 1066.\n\nThe coroner was formally established in England by Article 20 of the \"Articles of Eyre\" in September 1194 to \"keep the pleas of the Crown\" (Latin, \"custos placitorum coronae\") from which the word \"coroner\" is derived. This role provided a local county official whose primary duty was to protect the financial interest of the Crown in criminal proceedings. The office of coroner is, \"in many instances, a necessary substitute: for if the sheriff is interested in a suit, or if he is of affinity with one of the parties to a suit, the coroner must execute and return the process of the courts of justice.\" This role was qualified in Chapter 24 of Magna Carta in 1215, which states: \"No sheriff, constable, coroner or bailiff shall hold pleas of our Crown.\" \"Keeping the pleas\" was an administrative task, while \"holding the pleas\" was a judicial one that was not assigned to the locally resident coroner but left to judges who traveled around the country holding Assize Courts. The role of custos rotulorum or keeper of the county records became an independent office, which after 1836 was held by the Lord Lieutenant of each county. The person who found a body from a death thought sudden or unnatural was required to raise the \"hue and cry\" and to notify the coroner. While coronial manuals written for sheriffs, bailiffs, justices of the peace and coroners were published in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, handbooks specifically written for coroners were distributed in England in the eighteenth century.\n\nCoroners were introduced into Wales following its military conquest by Edward I of England in 1282 through the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284.\n\nAustralian coroners are responsible for investigating and determining the cause of death for those cases reported to them. In all states and territories, a coroner is a magistrate with legal training, and is attached to a local court. Four states ‚Äì New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia ‚Äì also have state coroners and specialised coronial courts. In Tasmania, the Chief Magistrate also acts as the state coroner.\n\nIn Canada the officer responsible for investigating all unnatural and natural unexpected, unexplained, or unattended deaths goes under the title \"coroner\" or \"medical examiner\" depending on location. While the title differs, however, they act in similar capacities. They do not determine civil or criminal responsibility, but instead make and offer recommendations to improve public safety and prevention of death in similar circumstances.\n\nCoroner or Medical Examiner services are under the jurisdiction of provincial or territorial governments, generally within the public safety and security or justice portfolio. These services are headed by a Chief Coroner (or Chief Medical Examiner) and comprise coroners or medical examiners appointed by the executive council.\n\nThe provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador have a Medical Examiner system, meaning that all death investigations are conducted by specialist physicians trained in Forensic Pathology, with the assistance of other medical and law enforcement personnel. All other provinces run on a coroner system. In Prince Edward Island, and Ontario, all coroners are, by law, physicians. In the other provinces and territories with a coroner system, namely British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Quebec, New Brunswick, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon, coroners are not necessarily physicians but generally have legal, medical, or investigative backgrounds.\n\nThe Coroner's Court is responsible to inquire into the causes and circumstances of some deaths. The Coroner is a judicial officer who has the power to:\n\nThe Coroner makes orders after considering the pathologist's report.\n\nThe Coroners Service is a network of Coroners situated across Ireland, usually covering areas based on Ireland's traditional counties. They are appointed by local authorities as independent experts and must be either qualified doctors or lawyers. Their primary function is to investigate any sudden, unexplained, violent or unnatural death in order to allow a death certificate to be issued. Any death due to unnatural causes will require an inquest to be held.\n\nTwo coronial services operate in New Zealand. The older one deals only with deaths before midnight of 30 June 2007 that remain under investigation. The new system operates under the Coroners Act 2006, which:\n\nn Poland, a coroner is a forensic doctor (colloquially called a forensic medicine), whose job is to legally identify patients who died. As a separate profession, it has existed since 2002, its introduction aimed to relieve home doctors and emergency physicians, as well as to prevent funeral corruption and corpses. The coroner is bound by business secret.\n\nThe responsibilities of the city coroner working on behalf of the city authorities in Poland include: declaring death, assessing the causes of death (natural or criminal), issuing relevant documents and keeping records.\n\nA family doctor may also be called to declare a death. In the event of an emergency, the doctor diagnoses an ambulance from the ambulance service. Doctors who have the legal right to declare death cooperate with funeral institutions.\n\nThe position of the first coroners was chosen in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ for experienced forensic doctors, who are on call and cooperating with the ambulance service, will be notified of evidential death reports to go to the indicated address. Just in case, the coroners were also equipped with the apparatus necessary to provide first aid.\n\nThe widespread employment of coroners requires adjusting the relevant provisions regulating who may, according to the law in force, make an act of finding a human death. It is believed that forensic doctors have appropriate education and professional practice to perform the function of coroners.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, the Ministry of Justice appoints \"Inquirers into Sudden Deaths\" under the \"Code of Criminal Procedure\" to carryout an inquest into the death of a sudden, unexpected and suspicious nature. Some large cities such as Colombo and Kandy have a City Coroners' Court attached to the main city hospital, with a Coroner and Additional Coroner. \n\nIn the United Kingdom a coroner is an independent judicial office holder, appointed and paid for by the relevant local authority. The Ministry of Justice, which is headed by the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice has the responsibility for the coronial law and policy only, and no operational responsibility.\nThere are separate services for England and Wales, and for Northern Ireland. A different system applies in Scotland, which does not have a coroner service.\nThe coroner service in England and Wales is supervised by the Chief Coroner, a judge appointed by the Lord Chief Justice after consulting the Lord Chancellor. He provides advice, guidance and training to coroners and aims to secure uniformity of practice throughout England and Wales. The post is currently part-time. The present Chief Coroner is Judge Mark Lucraft QC, who is one of the judges sitting at the Central Criminal Court. He has also been appointed a deputy judge of the High Court, and as such he normally sits as a member of the bench when that court has occasion to hold a judicial review of an inquest.\nEngland and Wales are divided into coroner districts by the Lord Chancellor, each district consisting of the area or areas of one or more local authorities. The relevant local authority, with the consent of the Chief Coroner and the Lord Chancellor, must appoint a Senior Coroner for the district. It must also appoint Area Coroners (in effect deputies to the Senior Coroner) and Assistant Coroners, to the number that the Lord Chancellor considers necessary in view of the physical character and population of the district. The cost of the coroner service for the district falls upon the local authority or authorities concerned, and thus ultimately upon the local inhabitants.\n\nThe majority of deaths are not investigated by the coroner. If the deceased has been under medical care, or has been seen by a doctor within 14 days of death, then the doctor can issue a death certificate. However if the deceased died without being seen by a doctor, or if they are unwilling to make a determination, the coroner will investigate the cause and manner of death. \nThe coroner will also investigate when a death is deemed violent or unnatural, where the cause is unknown, where a death is the result of poisoning or industrial injury, or if it occurred in police custody or prison. \nAny person aware of a dead body lying in the district of a coroner has a duty to report it to the coroner; failure to do so is an offence. This can include bodies brought into England or Wales.\n\nThe coroner has a team of Coroner's Officers (previously often ex-police officers, but increasingly from a nursing or other paramedical background) who carry out the investigation on the coroner's behalf. \nA coroner's investigation may involve a simple review of the circumstances, ordering a post-mortem examination, or they may decide that an inquest is appropriate. \nWhen a person dies in the custody of the legal authorities (in police cells, or in prison), an inquest must be held. In England, inquests are usually heard without a jury (unless the coroner wants one). However, a case in which a person has died under the control of central authority must have a jury, as a check on the possible abuse of governmental power.\n\nThe coroner's court is a court of law, and accordingly, the coroner may summon witnesses. Those found lying are guilty of perjury.\n\nAdditional powers of the coroner may include the power of subpoena and attachment, the power of arrest, the power to administer oaths, and sequester juries of six during inquests.\n\nCoroners also have a role in treasure trove cases. This role arose from the ancient duty of the coroner as a protector of the property of the Crown. It is now contained in the Treasure Act 1996. This jurisdiction is no longer exercised by local coroners, but by specialist \"Coroners for Treasure\" appointed by the Chief Coroner.\n\nTo become a coroner in England and Wales the applicant must be a qualified lawyer (solicitor/barrister), or a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives (CILEx), with at least 5 years' qualified experience. This reflects the role of a coroner: to determine the cause of death of a deceased in cases where the death was sudden, unexpected, occurred abroad, was suspicious in any way, or happened while the person was under the control of central authority (e.g., in police custody). Until 2013 a qualified medical practitioner could be appointed, but that is no longer possible. Any medical coroner still in office will either have been appointed before 2013, or, exceptionally, will hold both medical and legal qualifications.\n\nFormerly, every justice of the High Court was, \"ex officio\", a coroner for every district in England and Wales. This is no longer so; there are now no \"ex officio\" coroners. A senior judge is sometimes appointed \"ad hoc\" as a deputy coroner to undertake a high-profile inquest, such as those into the deaths of Diana, Princess of Wales and the victims of the 2005 London bombings.\n\nThe coroner's jurisdiction is limited to determining who the deceased was and how, when and where they came by their death. When the death is suspected to have been either sudden with unknown cause, violent, or unnatural, the coroner decides whether to hold a post-mortem examination and, if necessary, an inquest.\n\nThe coroner's former power to name a suspect in the inquest verdict and commit them for trial has been abolished. The coroner's verdict sometimes is persuasive for the police and Crown Prosecution Service, but normally proceedings in the coroner's court are suspended until after the final outcome of any criminal case is known. More usually, a coroner's verdict is also relied upon in civil proceedings and insurance claims. The coroner commonly tells the jury which verdicts are lawfully available in a particular case.\n\nThe most common verdicts include:\n\nLawful killing includes lawful self-defence. There is no material difference between an accidental death verdict and one of misadventure.\n\nThe verdicts of suicide and unlawful killing require proving beyond reasonable doubt. Other verdicts are arrived at on the balance of probabilities.\n\nA verdict of neglect requires that there was a need for relevant care (such as nourishment, medical attention, shelter or warmth) identified, and there was an opportunity to offer or provide that care that was not taken. Neglect can be ruled an aggravating factor in other verdicts as well as a freestanding verdict.\n\nAn open verdict is given where the cause of death cannot be identified on the evidence available to the inquest.\n\nA coroner giving a narrative verdict may choose to refer to the other verdicts. A narrative verdict may also consist of answers to a set of questions posed by the Coroner to himself or to the jury (as appropriate).\n\nThere are 98 coroners in England and Wales, covering 109 local authority areas.\n\nCoronial services in Northern Ireland are broadly similar to those in England and Wales, including dealing with treasure trove cases under the Treasure Act 1996. Northern Ireland has three coroners, who oversee the province as a whole. They are assisted by Coroners Liaison Officers and a medical Officer.\n\nIn Scotland there are no longer coroners. Coroners were used in Scotland between about 1500 and 1800 when they ceased to be used. Now deaths requiring judicial examination are reported to the Procurator Fiscal and dealt with by Fatal Accident Inquiries conducted by the Sheriff for the area.\n\n, of the 2,342 death investigation offices in the United States, 1,590 were coroners' offices, 82 of which served jurisdictions of more than 250,000 people. Qualifications for coroners are set by individual states and counties in the U.S., and vary widely. In many jurisdictions, little or no training is required, even though a coroner may overrule a forensic pathologist in naming a cause of death. Some coroners are elected, and others appointed. Some coroners hold office by virtue of holding another office: in Nebraska, the county district attorney is the coroner; in many counties in Texas, the Justice of the Peace may be in charge of death investigation; in other places, the sheriff is the coroner.\n\nIn different jurisdictions the terms \"coroner\" and \"medical examiner\" are defined differently. In some places, stringent rules require that the medical examiner be a forensic pathologist. In others, the medical examiner must be a physician, though not necessarily a forensic pathologist or even a pathologist; physicians with no experience in forensic medicine have become medical examiners. In others, such as Wisconsin, each county sets standards, and in some, the medical examiner does not need any medical or educational qualifications.\n\nNot all U.S. jurisdictions use a coroner system for medicolegal death investigation‚Äîsome are on a medical examiner system, others are on a mixed coroner‚Äìmedical examiner system. In the U.S., the terms \"coroner\" and \"medical examiner\" vary widely in meaning by jurisdiction, as do qualifications and duties for these offices.\n\nLocal laws define the deaths a coroner must investigate, but most often include those that are sudden, unexpected, and have no attending physician‚Äîand deaths that are suspicious or violent. In some places in the United States, a coroner has other special powers, such as the ability to arrest the county sheriff.\n\nDuties always include determining the cause, time, and manner of death. This uses the same investigatory skills of a police detective in most cases, because the answers are available from the circumstances, scene, and recent medical records. In many American jurisdictions, any death not certified by the person's own physician must be referred to the medical examiner. If an individual dies outside of his/her state of residence, the coroner of the state in which the death took place issues the death certificate. Only a small percentage of deaths require an autopsy to determine the time, cause and manner of death.\n\nIn some states, additional functions are handled by the coroner. For example, in Louisiana, coroners are involved in the determination of mental illness of living persons. In Georgia, the coroner has the same powers as a county sheriff to execute arrest warrants and serve process, and in certain situations where there is no sheriff, in addition to conducting cause and manner of death investigations and inquests, the coroner officially acts as sheriff for the county. Also the Coroner is the only official who can arrest the sheriff of a county. This is also the case in Colorado. Also in North Carolina, the coroner exists in approximately 65 counties by law, but is only an active office on ten. In Kentucky, section 72.415 of the Kentucky Revised Statutes gives coroners and their deputies the full power and authority of peace officers. This includes the power of arrest and the authority to carry firearms. In North Carolina, in the counties that have coroners, they are set forth as common law peace officers, yet the coroner of the county also has judicial powers; not only to investigate cause and manner of death, but to conduct inquests, issue court orders, to empanel a coroner's jury and to act as Sheriff in certain cases or even arrest the Sheriff for cause. Beginning in 2015, the NC Office of Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) began optional training for coroners to become special assistant medical examiner investigators (NC CH130A & 152). In Indiana the coroner is the only law enforcement officer who has the authority to arrest the county sheriff, incarcerate him, and take command of the county jail. The coroner is also the only official who may serve the sheriff with civil process. In New York City, the office of coroner was actually abolished in 1915, since before that time, having medical knowledge was not actually a requirement, leading to much abuse of position.\n\nThe office of coroner is common to most countries with a British colonial influence, but unusual outside of that. The equivalent offices in other nations follow the Medical Examiner model, or are part of the Police and Judiciary. In France the relevant official is the \"M√©decin l√©giste\" () and in Italy the \"Medicina legale\"(); in Germany it is the \"Gerichtmediziner\"(). In Spain and Portugal investigations are carried out by a forensic pathologist under the supervision of an Examining magistrate (a \"Juez de instrucci√≥n\"()). \n\nIn Japan the office of \"kenshi-kan\" (Ê§úË¶ñÂÆò)() generally translates as \"coroner\", but holders of the office are police detectives with field experience, thus resembling scenes of crime officers or crime scene investigators in English-speaking countries. A \"kenshi-kan\" typically holds the rank of captain, and has studied forensic medicine and investigation techniques at the National Police Academy.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough coroners are often depicted in police dramas as a source of information for detectives, there are a number of fictional coroners who have taken particular focus on television.

Crimestoppers is a program designed to utilize the media and other resources to entice information from the public that can facilitate police investigations. CSI is run by a volunteer board and its activities include hosting annual training conferences and supporting regional leadership and training programs. CSI coordinates networking resources for local Crimestoppers' operations, such as a website and a print publications called \"The Caller\". It is funded by dues paid by member organizations. Some of the services CSI provides to its members include an annual awards program for local Crimestoppers operations, produces an operations manual to assist new programs and to help set up and guide new Crimestopper programs, and providing legal services to its members.\n\nCSI lists its mission statement as the following: \"To develop Crime Stoppers as an effective crime-solving organization throughout the world, with the primary objective of the tri-partite organization, Community, Media and Law Enforcement, being, Working Together to Solve Crime\".\n\nThe Crimestoppers program began in the 1970s as an innovation to solve a crime that was committed with no witnesses and few leads for police investigators. The main goal is to produce televised re-enactments, offer rewards and promises of anonymity for information leading to an arrest. Detective Greg MacAleese was investigating the murder of a gas station attendant, Michael Carmen, in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 1976 when he came up with the idea.. At the time, Albuquerque had one of the highest per capita crime rates in the US. Its crime rate has since improved.\n\nIn Canada, a Supreme Court of Canada decision R. v . Leipert, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 281 ruled unanimously that police do not have to disclose any information they receive from this internationally recognized crime prevention program.\n\nThus a phone number was developed, 705-497-5555\n\nIn 2009, it was revealed that information from Crime Stoppers had resulted in 18 arrests, 34 charges and 23 cases cleared for the year. One of Barbados' leading newspapers additionally reported that Crime Stoppers Barbados Inc. was to-date the fastest growing of the worldwide organisations belonging to the group. Tony Phillips, as Chairman of the local unit stated that \"Over 90 per cent of the tips have been useful . . . [and] the success ratio is well documented by the police force.\" Regarding the local unit, Philips further maintained, \"They [Crime Stoppers] have never seen one of the organisations develop as quickly as we have, and I think that it is a significant achievement. Tips have been on or above average for a Crimestoppers International, exceeding 50 per month, which is the average for international organisations,\" he stated.\n\n\n"}

Further weathering yields material that easily crumbles into a mixtures of gravel-sized particles known as grus, that in turn may break down to produce a mixture of clay and silica sand or silt particles. Different specific granite types have differing propensities to weather, and so differing likelihoods of producing decomposed granite. It has practical uses that include its incorporation into paving and driveway materials, residential gardening materials in arid environments, as well as various types of walkways and heavy-use paths in parks. Different colors of decomposed granite are available, deriving from the natural range of granite colors from different quarry sources, and admixture of other natural and synthetic materials can extend the range of decomposed granite properties.\n\nDecomposed granite is rock of granitic origin that has weathered to the point that it readily fractures into smaller pieces of weak rock. Further weathering produces rock that easily crumbles into mixtures of gravel-sized particles, sand, and silt-sized particles with some clay. Eventually, the gravel may break down to produce a mixture of silica sand, silt particles, and clay. Different specific granite types have differing propensities to weather, and so differing likelihoods of producing decomposed granite.\n\nThe parent granite material is a common type of igneous rock that is granular, with its grains large enough to be distinguished with the unaided eye (i.e., it is phaneritic in texture); it is composed of plagioclase feldspar, orthoclase feldspar, quartz, mica, and possibly other minerals. The chemical transformation of feldspar, one of the primary constituents of granite, into the clay mineral kaolin is one of the important weathering processes. The presence of clay allows water to seep in and further weaken the rock allowing it to fracture or crumble into smaller particles, where, ultimately, the grains of silica produced from the granite are relatively resistant to weathering, and may remain almost unaltered.\n\nDecomposed granite, as a crushed stone form, is used as a pavement building material. It is used on driveways, garden walkways, bocce courts and p√©tanque terrains, and urban, regional, and national park walkways and heavy-use paths. DG can be installed and compacted to meet handicapped accessibility specifications and criteria, such as the ADA standards in the U.S. Different colors are available based on the various natural ranges available from different quarry sources, and polymeric stabilizers and other additives can be included to change the properties of the natural material. Decomposed granite is also sometimes used as a component of soil mixtures for cultivating bonsai.\n\n"}
{"id": "23439135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23439135", "title": "Disparate treatment", "text": "Disparate treatment\n\nDisparate treatment is one kind of unlawful discrimination in US labor law. In the United States, it means unequal behavior toward someone because of a protected characteristic (e.g. race or gender) under Title VII of the United States Civil Rights Act. This contrasts with disparate impact, where an employer applies a neutral rule that treats everyone equally in form, but has a disadvantageous effect on some people of a protected characteristic compared to others.\n\nTitle VII prohibits employers from treating applicants or employees differently because of their membership in a protected class. A disparate treatment violation is made out when an individual of a protected group is shown to have been singled out and treated less favorably than others similarly situated on the basis of an impermissible criterion under Title VII. The issue is whether the employer's actions were motivated by discriminatory intent. Discriminatory intent can either be shown by direct evidence, or through indirect or circumstantial evidence.\n\nUnder Title VII, a disparate-treatment plaintiff must establish \"that the defendant had a discriminatory intent or motive\" for taking a job-related action. This doctrine was read into the act in \"Griggs v. Duke Power Co.\", which interpreted the Act to prohibit, in some cases, employers' facially neutral practices that, in fact, are \"discriminatory in operation.\" The Griggs Court stated that the \"touchstone\" for disparate-impact liability is the lack of \"business necessity\": \"If an employment practice which operates to exclude [minorities] cannot be shown to be related to job performance, the practice is prohibited.\" If an employer met its burden by showing that its practice was job-related, the plaintiff was required to show a legitimate alternative that would have resulted in less discrimination.\n\nTwenty years after Griggs, the Civil Rights Act of 1991 was enacted. The Act included a provision codifying the prohibition on disparate-impact discrimination. Under the disparate-impact statute, a plaintiff establishes a prima facie violation by showing that an employer uses \"a particular employment practice that causes a disparate impact on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\" An employer may defend against liability by demonstrating that the practice is \"job related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity.\" Even if the employer meets that burden, however, a plaintiff may still succeed by showing that the employer refuses to adopt an available alternative employment practice that has less disparate impact and serves the employer's legitimate needs.\n\nUnder the direct method, a plaintiff tries to show that his membership in the protected class was a motivating factor in the adverse job action.\n\nIn the majority of cases, the plaintiff lacks direct evidence of discrimination and must prove discriminatory intent indirectly by inference. The Supreme Court analyzes these cases using the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting formula. The analysis is as follows:\n\nThe plaintiff in a disparate treatment case need only prove that membership in a protected class was a motivating factor in the employment decision, not that it was the sole factor. One's membership in a protected class will be considered a motivating factor when it contributes to the employment decision. If the employer proves that it had another reason for its actions and it would have made the same decision without the discriminatory factor, it may avoid liability for monetary damages, reinstatement or promotion. The court may still grant the plaintiff declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and attorneys' fees and costs.\n\nThe Seventh Circuit has held that in a mixed motives retaliation case, the plaintiff is not entitled to declaratory relief, injunctive relief, or attorneys fees because retaliation is not listed in the mixed motives provision of the 1991 Civil Rights Act.\n\nIf an employer takes an adverse employment action against an employee for a discriminatory reason and later discovers a legitimate reason that it can prove would have led it to take the same action, the employer is still liable for the discrimination, but the relief that the employee can recover may be limited. \"McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publishing Co.\", 513 U.S. 352 (1995). In general, the employee is not entitled to reinstatement or front pay, and the back pay liability period is limited to the time between the occurrence of the discriminatory act and the date the misconduct justifying the job action is discovered. McKennon, 513 U.S. at 361-62.\n\nIn class actions or other cases alleging a widespread practice of intentional discrimination, plaintiffs may establish a prima facie case using statistical evidence instead of comparative evidence pertaining to each class member. Plaintiffs often combine the statistical evidence with anecdotal or other evidence of discriminatory treatment. The employer can rebut the prima facie case by introducing alternative statistics or by demonstrating that plaintiff's proof is either inaccurate or insignificant. The plaintiff then bears the burden of proving that the employer's information is biased, inaccurate, or otherwise unworthy of credence.\n\nA violation of Title VII can be shown in two separate and distinct ways. The alternative to a \"disparate treatment\" theory is a \"disparate impact\" theory. A disparate impact violation is when an employer is shown to have used a specific employment practice, neutral on its face but that caused a substantial adverse impact to a protected group, and cannot be justified as serving a legitimate business goal for the employer. No proof of intentional discrimination is necessary.\n\nThe disparate treatment theory has application also in the housing context under Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, also known as the Fair Housing Act. The Fair Housing Act prohibits disparate treatment in the housing market due to race, color, religion, national origin, sex, family status, and disability. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity enforces this law. It receives and investigates any discrimination complaints that are filed.\n\n"}

Unlike pollution control laws, cleanup laws are designed to respond after-the-fact to environmental contamination, and consequently must often define not only the necessary response actions, but also the parties who may be responsible for undertaking (or paying for) such actions. Regulatory requirements may include rules for emergency response, liability allocation, site assessment, remedial investigation, feasibility studies, remedial action, post-remedial monitoring, and site reuse.<section end=overview />\n\nDifferent laws may govern the cleanup or remediation of varying environmental media. Spill response or cleanup requirements may be enacted as stand-alone laws, or as parts of larger laws focused on a specific environmental medium or pollutant.\n\nEnvironmental cleanup laws may contain requirements for identifying and responding to environmental emergencies. In such cases, laws may define when immediate response actions are required, or criteria by which a regulatory agency may make such a determination. Immediate response actions may be required, for example, when a release of a pollutant into the environment poses an immediate threat to human health or ecological values. Events such as oil spills and large-scale chemical releases often trigger emergency response actions.\n\nEnvironmental remediation is the process of physically removing, treating, or isolating pollutants in environmental media. Environmental cleanup laws may contain specific requisite remediation protocols, or may contain standards and processes by which a regulatory agency may determine an appropriate remedy.\n"}

This executive order was titled \"United States Intelligence Activities\".\n\nIt was amended by Executive Order 13355: Strengthened Management of the Intelligence Community, on August 27, 2004. On July 30, 2008, President George W. Bush issued Executive Order 13470 amending Executive Order 12333 to strengthen the role of the DNI.\n\n\"Goals, Direction, Duties and Responsibilities with Respect to the National Intelligence Effort\" lays out roles for various intelligence agencies, including the Departments of Defense, Energy, State, and Treasury.\n\n\"Conduct of Intelligence Activities\" provides guidelines for actions of intelligence agencies.\n\nPart 2.3 permits collection, retention and dissemination of the following types of information along with several others.\n\nPart 2.11 of this executive order reiterates a proscription on US intelligence agencies sponsoring or carrying out an assassination. It reads:\n\nNo person employed by or acting on behalf of the United States Government shall engage in, or conspire to engage in, political assassination.\n\nPreviously, EO 11905 (Gerald Ford) had banned political assassinations and EO 12036 (Jimmy Carter) had further banned indirect U.S. involvement in assassinations. As early as 1998, this proscription against assassination was reinterpreted, and relaxed, for targets who are classified by the United States as connected to terrorism.\n\nExecutive Order 12333 has been regarded by the American intelligence community as a fundamental document authorizing the expansion of data collection activities. The document has been employed by the National Security Agency as legal authorization for its collection of unencrypted information flowing through the data centers of internet communications giants Google and Yahoo!.\n\nIn July 2014 chairman David Medine and two other members of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, a government oversight agency, indicated a desire to review Executive Order 12333 in the near future, according to a report by journalist Spencer Ackerman of \"The Guardian\".\n\nIn July 2014, former State Department official John Tye published an editorial in \"The Washington Post\", citing his prior access to classified material on intelligence-gathering activities under Executive Order 12333, and arguing that the order represented a significant threat to Americans' privacy and civil liberties.\n\nIn the movie \"Get Smart\", Agent 23 tells Maxwell Smart,\"assassinations are prohibited by Executive Order 1-2-333.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The law enhanced criminal enforcement of federal fraud laws, especially regarding financial institutions, mortgage fraud, and securities fraud or commodities fraud.\n\nU.S. Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, a Democrat and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, sponsored the bill.\n\nOn April 27, 2009, the Senate invoked cloture on the bill as amended (S. 386) on an 84‚Äì4 vote, with eleven not voting. Only four Senators voted no, all Republicans (Tom Coburn, Jim DeMint, James Inhofe, and Jon Kyl). On April 28, the Senate passed the bill on a 92‚Äì4 vote, with three not voting; the same Senators who voted against cloture voted against the bill.\n\nOn May 6, the United States House of Representatives passed the bill with its own amendment on a 367‚Äì59 vote, with six Representatives not voting and one Representative, Democrat Alan Grayson of Florida, voting present. All 250 Democrats casting votes, as well as 117 Republicans, voted yes; all of the 59 no votes were cast by Republicans.\n\nThe Senate then added an amendment to the House's amendment. The House accepted the final version of the bill on a 338‚Äì52 vote on May 18, with 43 Representatives not voting. All 224 Democrats casting votes, as well as 114 Republicans, voted yes. Fifty-two Republicans voted no.\n\nPresident Barack Obama signed the legislation into law on May 20 along with the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009, a bill concerned with mortgage foreclosure prevention.\n\nThe Act changes the definition of a \"financial institution\" for the purposes of Federal criminal law to include \"mortgage lending businesses\", which are defined as \"organizations which finance or refinance any debt secured by an interest in real estate, including private mortgage companies and any subsidiaries of such organizations, and whose activities affect interstate or foreign commerce.\" , which makes it a federal offense to falsify loan documents submitted to a broad range of financial institutions, is amended to include mortgage lending businesses in that range, and for good measure also includes any other person \"that makes in whole or in part a federally related mortgage loan\".\n\nThe crime of major fraud against the United States (), which previously covered only fraud in government procurement and contracts for services, is amended to include a wider range of government involvement, including grants under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, transactions under the Troubled Assets Relief Program, and any \"other form of Federal assistance\". FERA amends the definition of securities fraud, , to include fraud related to commodities futures and options in addition to the existing category of registered securities under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nFinally, the Act defines \"proceeds\" in the money laundering statute () as \"any property derived from or obtained or retained, directly or indirectly, through some form of unlawful activity, including the gross receipts of such activity\". Previously, the term was left undefined, and was interpreted by the United States Supreme Court in \"United States v. Santos\" by a plurality of the justices as excluding gross receipts. A \"Sense of the Congress\" section suggests that senior prosecutors, such as a United States Attorney or superior, should be involved before certain kinds of money-laundering cases are instigated, and directs the Attorney General to deliver a yearly report on such cases for the next four years.\n\nSection 3 of the Act authorizes additional funding to detect and prosecute fraud at various federal agencies, specifically:\n\nThese authorizations are made for the federal fiscal years beginning October 1, 2009 and 2010, after which point they expire, and are in addition to the previously authorized budgets for these agencies.\n\nSection 4 of FERA restates part of the False Claims Act, to \"reflect the original intent of the law\". This amendment is in reaction to the Supreme Court's 2008 decision in \"Allison Engine Co. v. United States ex rel. Sanders\", in which the Court held that the mere involvement of Federal money was insufficient to bring a fraudulent claim or invoice within the scope of the False Claims Act. The amended subsection (a) of effectively reverses the \"Allison Engine\" decision, weakening the requirement to \"a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim\", where a \"claim\" includes \"any request or demand\" related to a government program and which will be paid from funds supplied by the government.\n\nFinally, section 5 of the Act created the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, a legislative commission with each house of the United States Congress represented by three members appointed by the majority party and two members appointed by the minority, none of whom may be employees of the Federal government or any state or local government. The purpose of the commission is \"to examine the causes, domestic and global, of the current financial and economic crisis in the United States.\"\n"}
{"id": "56009963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56009963", "title": "Fugitive dust", "text": "Fugitive dust\n\nFugitive dust is an environmental air quality term that refers to very small particles suspended in the air, the source of which is primarily the Earth's soil. It does not include particulate matter from other common sources, such as vehicle exhaust or smokestacks. Fugitive dust particles are mainly minerals common to soil, including silicon oxides, aluminium, calcium, and iron. About half of fugitive dust particles are larger than 10 microns in diameter and settle more quickly than the smaller particles. The term is used to denote that the dust \"escapes\" into the atmosphere rather than being exhausted in a \"confined flow stream\" from a \"ducted emitter\" (an exhaust pipe or chimney).\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimated that fugitive dust was responsible for 92% of the PM-10 emissions in the United States in 1995.\n\nFugitive dust results from dry conditions where there is insufficient moisture content in the ground to hold the soil together. Particulate matter (PM) then enters the atmosphere through the action of wind, vehicular movement, or other activities.\n\nAreas with dry or desert climates, especially when combined with high winds, have more severe problems of fugitive dust. Dry and disturbed surfaces can release wind-borne fugitive dust for many months before there is sufficient rainfall to coagulate the soil. Surfaces susceptible to fugitive dust emissions are both natural and man-made.\n\nSpecific sources include open fields and parking lots, paved and unpaved roads, agricultural fields, construction sites, unenclosed storage piles, and material transfer systems.\n\nSurface mining operations are also sources of fugitive dust as a result of many mining operations including haul roads, tailing piles, drilling, blasting, the removal of overburden and the actual mineral extraction.\n\nIn 1995, 28 percent of fugitive dust in the US originated from unpaved roads, 23 percent from construction sites, 19 percent agricultural, 15 percent from paved roads, 5 percent from wind erosion, 1 percent from mining according to the EPA.\n\nThe inhalation of PM by people introduces it into the lungs where it can cause respiratory illnesses, permanent lung damage, and in some individuals premature death. PM with diameters of ‚â§10 micrometers (PM10) can harm human health, with particles of ‚â§2.5 micrometers (PM2.5) being the worst.\n\nAs wind-borne dust can easily migrate, respiratory irritation can occur in construction and agricultural workers close to a source as well as others including wildlife. In addition to adverse health affects, the abrasive nature of particulate matter can cause property damage and obscure visibility leading to vehicular collisions causing injury and death.\n\nFugitive dust can also harm plant life. In 1999, the National Park Service found that lichen and other non-vascular plants in the Cape Krusenstern National Monument in Alaska were affected due to dust generated from hauling ore from the Red Dog mine along a road within the monument. A follow-up study in 2006 found slightly elevated levels of lead and cadmium concentrations in small birds and voles captured along the road.\n\nA lawsuit in 2011 filed by 150 Waimea, Hawaii residents alleges that their homes were subjected, \"on almost a daily basis\", to blown \"pesticide-laden fugitive dust\". The residents claimed their homes sustained physical damage and they were forced to live with their windows closed year-round. They were seeking monetary damages from DuPont Pioneer to compensate for the reduced value of their homes and suggested future lawsuits would address health issues.\n\nA 2017 lawsuit in Maryland claims that fugitive dust from a -high pile of coal dust at a coal processing plant has caused \"extensive damage\" through erosion to blades on wind turbines in a nearby wind farm.\n\nOne of the first methods of measuring fugitive dust was developed in the 1970s and used isokinetic dust samplers. At least six samplers were needed downstream of a dust source. Exposure profiling was developed later and used in the 1980s and 1990s. Later improvements use time-resolved dust monitors to isolate short-term dust releases. New methods include Optical Remote Sensing which uses an open path laser transmissometer used with time-resolved dust monitors and other wind monitors.\n\nVarious methods are employed to minimize fugitive dust. In agricultural settings, bare soil can be covered with crop residue or planted with cover crops between seasons. Dirt roads can be sprayed with water to contain dust, or stabilized with chemicals that form hard surface crusts, or paved with aggregate or a hard surface. In windy areas, wind barriers including fences or vegetation can reduce wind speed and trap larger particles already in the air. Irrigation can be used to keep soil moist between natural rainfalls.\n\nFugitive dust can be controlled by the application of various chemical suppressants including lignin sulfonates, petroleum resins, latexes, salts, plastics, and wetting agents.\n\nCoal dust piles have been treated with water or other chemical surfactants to suppress dust until the moisture evaporates. Other chemicals can provide protection for up to six months. Wind fences of polyester fabric can also be used to slow wind movement and minimize fugitive dust.\n\nThe US state of Arizona has an Agricultural Dust Program with compliance officers that inspect agricultural operations and investigate dust complaints. All farms in the state must take \"reasonable precautions\" to \"minimize\" the emission of fugitive dust. More stringent procedures must be followed in areas that don't meet Federal air quality standards.\n\nThe US Federal Environmental Protection Agency has specific standards for daily average particulate matter originating from active mines. Finer particulates have been detected up to from mining operations.\n\nDust emitted from processing equipment that may not contain typical soil components is also considered fugitive dust. In this context, fugitive dust is dust that has \"escaped\" during any mechanical process and entered the atmosphere. Fugitive dust emissions within a structure can not only cause respiratory problems but, when generated during the processing of combustible materials, can cause fire and blast damage if ignited.\n\nFugitive dust acquires an electronic charge when dispersed in the air. Spraying an oppositely charged water fog can be used to effectively control dust in an industrial setting. If so charged, less water is needed to cause the particulate matter to drop from the air. This method has been tested with many materials including silica flour, sulfur dioxide, and fly ash.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "39069378", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39069378", "title": "Ilbe Storehouse", "text": "Ilbe Storehouse\n\nIlbe Storage (), also known as ILBE (), is a right-wing website based in South Korea. The site, created in April 2010, began as a collection of the \"daily popular\" posts from the BBS of South Korean social website DC Inside. This gave the site its name Ilbe, which is short for Ilgan Best, Korean for popular daily. As of February 2017, it is the most popular Internet humor site in South Korea by daily traffic.\n\nIlbe's userbase has strong right tendencies. The website has very few rules, but it does prohibit users from mentioning each other by their username or getting too close to each other, in order to prevent new users or dissenters from being down-voted indiscriminately by existing users. This policy has effectively made everyone more anonymous (and equal), in contrast with other popular Korean forums where the old users are more respected and hold greater authority during discussions. The forums are largely unmoderated, with exceptions made for cases that may result in litigation or cases in response to complaints.\n\nThe lack of moderation, however, does result in problematic behaviors such as defamation or harassment, which are criminal under Korean Law. The website routinely comes under criticism for its users' actions, the most notable of which was the Korea Communications Standards Commission's request that Ilbe regulate problematic contents that are harmful for teenagers. On the other hand, the website has been praised for its anonymity and free spirit: a spokesman of Saenuri Party mentioned Ilbe as \"free space where innocent people can speak their minds freely\".\n\nA large part of Ilbe's subculture comes from the users' collective identity as \"losers\" of a sort: until the founding of Ilbe, most of the large community forums on the Korean web were left-leaning to an extent where anyone with even a moderate right-wing opinion had to endure ridicule and name-calling by the majority including the moderators. Thus, Ilbe's userbase has embraced many of the derogatory terms used by the left to show pride in their dissent. Due to their vocal users and strong political/cultural influence, Ilbe has gained widespread attention by social critics, with some labeling the website a social phenomenon, and some critics consider Ilbe a Korean analogue of 4chan and 2channel.\n\nAs a vocal minority of the users engage in questionable behavior both online and offline, the website has largely negative connotation, especially with the political left. Thus, the users tend not to reveal their identity as an Ilbe user in the real world to prevent themselves from being ostracized. The term \"Ilming-out\" (), which is a portmanteau of \"Ilbe\" and \"Coming out (of the closet)\", describes a disclosure as an Ilbe user to the general public, and is avoided. Having to resort to more discreet measures to display their identity, Ilbe users use a hand sign that represents the Korean initials of the website's name.\n\nIlbe's political stance generally ranges from right to far-right, and Ilbe has raised controversy for its strong opinions, mainly from the left.\n\nIn parliamentary inspection held in October 2013, member of Democratic Party Yu Seung-hui criticized Ilbe's antisocial aspect. He released the information from Korean Communications Standards Commission, hundreds of submitted complaints about harmful contents in Ilbe like suicide, crime, drug, sexism, violence, as well as defamation and discrimination against left-wing politics and Jeolla province.\n\nShin Hye-sik, representative of right-wing online press \"Dokrip Newspaper\" said \"(Ilbe users) should make an apology for problematic claims\". Kim Young-hwan, former pro-NK activist and a convert to the right now, said \"Right-wing is an attitude to inherit conservative awareness, but in this criteria Ilbe is not right-wing. Ilbe's radical argument will escalate social chaos\". Yoon Pyong-joong, right-wing professor of Hanshin University defined Ilbe's far-right extremism as \"Isn't worth saying at all\". They shared the understanding that Ilbe should be criticized by public argument, not by legal action.\n\nConservative monthly magazine 'Shindonga' released a special section to criticize Ilbe as 'close to fascism rather than normal right-wing' and 'antisocial'.\n\nJapanese journalist Yasuda Goichi, the author of \"The Internet and Patriotism\" (Netto to Aikoku) diagnosed Ilbe as similar to anti-Zainichi association, one of Japanese cyber far-right group (Uyoku dantai).\n\nThe Ilbe Community is mainly known by citizens for allegedly making fun of former president Roh Moo-hyun. The political parties have declared a war against the Ilbe Community, as they have been consecutively criticizing Roh Mu-Hyeon, and other political leaders through many forms of media, such as making jokes, parody music containing criticisms and people's discontent against political leaders such as Park Geun-hye and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, and spreading rumors on social media. Users make an Ilbe \"theme song\" every year, and they regularly parody popular songs with lyrics that criticize the leaders. Ilbe users compose their parody songs as a propaganda that attracts people who coincidentally listen to their songs, to join the community. Users are trying to add a sense of humor to their songs, such as exaggerating expressions of political leaders and colloquially referring them as \"MC Muhyeon\", \"DJ Daejung\", \"MC Jong-Un\" and \"MC Geunhye\".This makes their songs sound legitimate in some ways.\nRecently, following up the uprising criticisms and hostility against the Ilbe Community, Korean celebrities who accidentally use Ilbe terminology on social media make people misunderstand them as an Ilbe member. As a result, comic artists and companies are adding caution to their productions to avoid being misunderstood as an Ilbe member.\n\nAlthough the South Korean government, judiciary and legislature officially concluded that the Gwangju Uprising was a justified civil movement by passing a special law, (also confirmed by UNESCO who registered records of the Gwangju Uprising as UNESCO World Heritage), Ilbe is propagating unverified conspiracy theories about Korean democratization.\n\nThe May 18 Memorial Foundation (5.18 Í∏∞ÎÖêÏû¨Îã®), one of the Gwangju Uprising memorial organizations, announced that Ilbe is spreading questionable information like,\n\nClaims similar to Ilbe's were denied by the government multiple times. The Minister of National Defense, Kim Gwan-jin, dismissed the allegation of North Korea's involvement during democratization as 'groundless'. The Korean Communications Standards Commission decided to take disciplinary action against the right-wing television news programs, 'TV Chosun' and 'Channel A', which made allegation of North Korea's involvement during democratization. It was accused of \"both defamation and spreading false information\".\n\nIn November 2013, the Daegu District Court dismissed a similar case of defamation against Gwangju Uprising victims, committed by 10 members of Jeonsamo (a Chun Doo-hwan fan group). Although they were found not guilty, the judge explained that their claim was insufficient to be considered defamation.\n\nEven journalist Cho Gap-je, who was on the scene in Gwangju, admitted that the Gwangju Uprising was a righteous anti-communism democratic movement in his testimony.\n\nConsidering all these, Ilbe uses the word 'democratization' in a negative sense, similar in meaning to \"thumbs down\". However, various users of Ilbe claim that the seemingly inappropriate use of the word is just a mockery of the left wing.\n\nIlbe's opinions are expressed as strong opposition to left wing parties, political figures and supporters, alongside indiscriminate labeling of the South Korean left wing as pro-communism, pro-North Korea, pro-socialism, and anti-South Korean.\n\nIlbe also labels some journalist like former chief editor of Monthly Chosun Cho Gap-je as \"Ï¢åÎπ®\" (Far-left communist) due to his support of the Gwangju Uprising as a justifiable movement. Even though former president Roh Mu-hyun and Kim Dae-jung used neoliberal economic policies, and came under criticism from the left-wing for their conservative stance, Ilbe considers both to be 'communists' due to their conciliatory attitude toward North Korea in economy and diplomacy.\n\nA sizable part of Ilbe users have an intense disliking for the Jeolla region in the southwestern portion of South Korea. This is due to several factors, including the fact that Jeolla province had a staggering 98% vote for a regional (left-wing) party candidate Kim Dae-jung, and their belief that the Gwangju Uprising has been placed on a pedestal by the locals, to the extent that all other moments in the history of Korean democratisation are overlooked, and that it was not a democratization uprising or movement, but simply a riot. The intense disliking manifests itself as verbal attack against Jeolla and related political figures.\n\nIlbe users show protests to different issues of the country, and they end up doing mass protests and singing Ilbe songs in city squares. Many Ilbe users ended up in court for degrading the public order. On November 28, 2013, there was a first trial of defamation committed by Ilbe user who injured the honor of Gwangju Uprising victims by disparaging their corpse photo as 'Skate(fish) parcel'. Offender claimed that he feels sorry for his crime and he sent such apology to the victims by phone call, but the organizations related to Gwangju Uprising victims said there was no such apology. Offender requested the jurisdictional transfer of his case from Gwangju District Court to Daegu District Court and it was accepted.\n\nOn September 30, 2013, 32-year-old male Ilbe user pushed ahead sandwich-man protest in front of Ewha Women's University. He was hanging a cardboard on his neck filled with sentences like insulting Ewha University students, comfort women, other Korean women, and their genitals, sexually. Also there were words like 'such women are communists and Pro-North Korea'. He was charged 1.5 million won of penalty from Seoul West Prosecutor's Office, but he blamed his guilt as 'wrong democracy'.\n\nSeoul Central District Court accepted the provisidonal injunction against Ilbe. It was petitioned by an Ilbe critic who was degraded and threatened from Ilbe user. As a result, Ilbe was forced to delete some antisocial contents.\n\nOn November 7, 2013, former first lady Lee Hui-ho, whose husband was former president Kim Dae-jung accused some Ilbe users of degrading deceased president Kim by spreading false information.\n\nOn August 2017, Gi Maeng-gi, author of the Naver webtoon \"My ID is Gangnam Beauty\", sued an Ilbe member for making malicious posts about her on the site.\n\nIn November 2018, Seoul Police Agency raided Ilbe Storehouse's with servers secured after securing warrant for search of membership informations and records on basis of violation of sexual violence law due to postings of content such as spycam porn, private pictures that may or may not contain nudity among other charges.\n\nIn April 2013, After Anonymous Korea released the member list of Uriminzokkiri, Ilbe users witchhunted massive identities from the list as 'communist' and 'North Korean spies'.\n\nA pre-service elementary teacher who depicted female elementary school students as \"Î°úÎ¶∞Ïù¥\" (Lolita girl) and wrote his experience of prostitution on Ilbe caused controversy. This was ended by giving up his appointment by himself. \nAfter the Seoul National University Student Council's protesting declaration against 2013 South Korea Election Meddling Scandal, Ilbe user released the photos of some members as an opposition and mentioned 'I don't care whether you guys lynch them or not'. Seoul National University Student Council said they're considering lawsuit against Ilbe.\n\nThe website has also raised controversy by mocking the early death of boy-band singer Lim Yoon-taek from stomach cancer and former president Roh Moo-hyun\n\nOn November 22, 2013, student of Kangwon Provincial College who is self-claimed Ilbe user uploaded Twitter which contains sexual harassment on female buddhist monk's virginity. Three days later, the monk Hyo-jeon asked for follow-up action to the president of the college. But Ilbe user didn't apologize his crime and kept insulting her. After controversy he deleted his Twitter account and this is ended with an official apology from the president of the college.\n\nIlbe takes an extremely hostile attitude toward types South Korean women that it deems undesirable, and expresses hatred towards them. Ilbe members think that men are superior and that women should be deferential to them. Ilbe labels women who do not comport to such gender norms as \"Kimchi Nyun,\" which is a reference to their national food, kimchi. Through this label, Ilbe community implies that such characteristic is only displayed in Korean women.\n\nOne sexual assault counsellor said \"It is the combination of commodification of women and peer culture which lies beneath Korean society\", and women organization Womenlink activist Lee Yoon-so said \"Ilbe seems to express misogyny behind anonymousity, and enjoying its propagation\". The misogyny is expressed as Ilbe's language subculture Misogynistic Ilbe users simultaneously bemoan the fact that men have to serve in the military and that most of breadwinners in South Korean families are men, while also bemoaning the fact of women in the workplace. Hence, women are attacked both for being housewives and for working.\n\nSuch misogyny and male chauvinism is sometimes expressed as actual sexual harassment against women.\n\nIlbe Community can be seen as anti-feminism community, composed of mostly males. The female users of Ilbe are called \"Am-Be-Choong\" (ÏïîÎ≤†Ï∂©) (Am: expression of females (mostly used in animals.)/Be: (ilbe)/Choong: insect) by the users. The female users who openly \"comes out\" as a female are banned from the website, mainly because their presences are likely to cause disputes in such masculine community, contributing to the decline of the website.\n\nIn December 2013, some self-claimed Ilbe users start vandalizing hand-written posters in universities and colleges around South Korea. Publicizing hand-written posters which criticizes political indifference, social disharmony, inequality, South Korea spy allegations, ongoing rail strike, and other political and social issues is started from Korea University and it spread among some Korean universities. However, this culture is generally seen as far-left, communistic and pro-North Korea by such Ilbe users.\n\nHand-written posters on the Korea University campus were vandalized by self-claimed Ilbe users. He confirmed his vandalism by uploading his photo online with sexual degrade against original writer of the poster. After it became controversial, he uploaded an apology for his actions. But he also announced that he will accuse people first who degraded him and his action and revealed his identity.\n\nSimilar vandalism is ongoing nationwide such as Busan University, Hannam University in Daejeon, Sogang University.\n\nHa Tae-kyung, a member of conservative Saenuri Party (former Liberty Korea Party) blamed Ilbe users who committed such vandalism as \"losers\".\n\nIn 2012, some anonymous Ilbe users attempted an XSS script attack against TodayHumor, a website with a left-wing stance. The administrator of TodayHumor announced that he would consider legal action against Ilbe.\n\nAn unknown hacker group made a distributed denial-of-service attack on the site on 7 April 2013. The attack was reported as possible revenge of Anonymous for Ilbe's vandalism in #OpIsrael IRC. Anonymous Korea claimed on its Twitter account that it was not involved with the denial of service at Ilbe. However Anonymous Korea also mentioned that Ilbe members entered the chatroom used by Anonymous hackers and stirred them up, using insulting language and flooding the chatroom with repeated text. The relationship between Anonymous Korea and Anonymous remains ambiguous.\n\nSome police officers and soldiers publicly described former presidents Chun Doo-hwan and Park Chung-hee as 'patriotic' on Ilbe, which caused controversy because they violated the political neutrality required for public officers.\n\nIn another instance, a police officer described left-wing protesters as 'rioters' on Ilbe. He was sent to the Yongsan police office disciplinary committee.\n\nOn 10 December 2013, an Ilbe user claiming to be an employee of the Comotomo feeding bottle company alleged that he interrupted the manufacturing process by 'sucking on' feeding bottles. He confirmed his employment at the company by uploading his photo on Ilbe under the title 'Titty Party' and commented \"Sometimes I suck this feeding bottle when I miss female breasts so much\". His post raised outrage in the childcare community; not only for his vulgarism but also over hygiene concerns. Comotomo Korea released an official apology for the controversy and mentioned their employment of the Ilbe user was a mistake. The employee's accident report was revealed, in which he confessed: \"I submitted vulgar contents on Ilbe. I caused economic and mental damage to the company and consumers for my own entertainment. The feeding bottle controversy that I created is totally false and I will take any legal responsibility.\"\n\nSouth Korean police arrested Ilbe users for writing comments on the site that allegedly insulted victims of the Sewol ferry disaster. At the public square located at the Gwanghwamun gate, families of the ferry victims were staging a hunger strike to protest the perceived lack of government action. Ilbe users organised a binge event, eating lots of pizza right next to the bereaved families.\n\nAgency of Korean K-pop dance group Crayon Pop mentioned Ilbe as 'antisocial' while denying alleged involvement with Ilbe.\n\nSome Ilbe members are alleged to have registered in SHINee world (fan club) to post defamatory comments about Jonghyun after he voiced his support to a student cause in support of gay rights, which was one of above-mentioned hand-written posters around Korean universities. Moreover, they also posted obscene photos with offensive captions related to women's bodies on the fan site.\n\nKorean professional gamer Hong Jin-ho denied his alleged involvement with Ilbe, mentioning \"I have never visited Ilbe. I heard about Ilbe and it is disagreeable. Such allegations are disgusting.\" on his Twitter account.\n\nConservative Saenuri Party member Kim Jin-tae raised controversy by accessing Ilbe with his laptop during parliamentary inspection at National Assembly.\n"}
{"id": "544064", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=544064", "title": "Indian Act", "text": "Indian Act\n\nThe Indian Act (\"An Act respecting Indians\", ), (the \"Act\") is a Canadian Act of Parliament that concerns registered Indians, their bands, and the system of Indian reserves. First passed in 1876 and still in force with amendments, it is the primary document which defines how the Government of Canada interacts with the 614 First Nation bands in Canada and their members. Throughout its long history the \"Act\" has been an ongoing subject of controversy and has been interpreted in different ways by both Aboriginal Canadians and non-Aboriginal Canadians. The legislation has been amended many times, including \"over twenty major changes\" made by 2002.\n\nThe \"Act\" is very wide-ranging in scope, covering governance, land use, healthcare, education, and more on Indian reserves. Notably, the original \"Indian Act\" does two things affecting all indigenous peoples in Canada:\n\nThe \"Act\"'s existence is necessitated by the fact that First Nations (historically called \"Indians\") relate differently to the state because of inherited legal arrangements such as the Royal Proclamation of 1763 and various treaties, and because Canada's constitution specifically assigns Native issues to the federal, rather than provincial governments, by the terms of Section 91(24) of the \"Constitution Act, 1867.\" The \"Indian Act\" replaced any laws on the topic passed by a local legislature before a province joined Canadian Confederation, creating a definitive national policy on the subject. The \"Act\" is not a treaty; it is Canada's legal response to the treaties. Nevertheless, its unilateral nature, imposed on indigenous peoples by the Canadian government in contrast to the treaties, is itself a source of discontent among Native peoples in Canada.\n\nThe \"Indian Act\" was first passed in 1876 as a consolidation of various laws concerning indigenous peoples enacted by the separate colonies of British North America prior to Canadian Confederation, most notably the \"Gradual Civilization Act\" passed by the Parliament of the Province of Canada in 1857 and the \"Gradual Enfranchisement Act\" of 1869. The \"Indian Act\" was passed by the Parliament of Canada under the provisions of Section 91(24) of the \"Constitution Act, 1867\", which provides Canada's federal government exclusive authority to govern in relation to \"Indians and Lands Reserved for Indians\". It was an attempt to codify rights promised to Native peoples by British King George III in the Royal Proclamation of 1763, while at the same time enforcing Euro-Canadian standards of \"civilization\". The purpose of the act, as stated by its drafters, was to administer Indian affairs in such a way that Indian people would feel compelled to renounce their Indian status and join Canadian civilization as full members: a process called enfranchisement.\n\nThe idea of enfranchisement predated the 1876 version of \"Indian Act\" and survived in some form until 1985. Upon the introduction in 1857 by the Tach√©-Macdonald administration of the Gradual Civilization Act and until 1961, the enfranchisement process was compulsory for men of age 21 able to read and write English.\n\nReserves, under this legislation, were islands within Canada to which were attached a different set of rights. \"Enfranchisement\" derives from the idea of \"franchise\", which has gradually been degraded as \"vote\". Indigenous people with the franchise were allowed to vote for representatives, were expected to pay taxes and lived \"off-reserve\". By contrast, groups of people who lived on a reserve were subject to a different set of rights and obligations. One needed to descend from an Indian to be allowed to live on a reserve.\n\nThe tenure of land in a reserve was limited to the collective, or tribe, by virtue of a Crown protectorate. Interactions between enfranchised citizens and Indians were subject to strict controls; for example, the enfranchised were forbidden by the Royal Proclamation of 1763 to traffic in alcohol or land with Indians. It was hoped through means of fiduciary duty voluntarily taken up by the Crown to preserve the Indian identity, but this was later vitiated by the compulsory enfranchisement scheme of the \"Gradual Civilization Act\". The 1985 amendment to the \"Indian Act\" extinguished the idea of enfranchisement.\n\nUnder the section entitled \"Reserves\" in the \"Indian Act\", it is stated that reserves are \"to be held for use and benefit of Indians.\n\nIn the \"Indian Act\", updated to April 2013, the term \"band\",\n\nFundamental to Canada's ability to interact with First Nations peoples is the question of defining who they are (e.g. who are the \"Indians\" of the \"Indian Act\"?), and this aspect of the legislation has been an ongoing source of controversy throughout its history. Not all people who self-identify as \"Aboriginal\" are considered \"Indians\" under the terms of the act. Only those on the official Indian Register maintained by the federal government (or a local \"band list\" in some cases) are Status Indians, subject to the full legal benefits and restrictions of the \"Indian Act\". Notably this excludes M√©tis people, Inuit people, and so-called Non-Status Indians. Various amendments and court decisions have repeatedly altered the rules regarding who is eligible for Indian Status. Many bands now maintain their own band lists.\n\nThough people accepted into band membership under band rules may not be status Indians, Bill C-31 clarified that various sections of the \"Indian Act\" would apply to such members. The sections in question are those relating to community life (e.g., land holdings). Sections relating to Indians (Aboriginal people) as individuals (in this case, wills and taxation of personal property) were not included.\nPrior to 1985, Indians could lose status in a variety of ways including the following:\n\nThese provisions interfered with the matrilineal cultures of many First Nations, whereby children were born to the mother's clan and people, and gained their status in the tribe from her family. Often property and hereditary leadership passed through the maternal line.\n\nIn \"Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell\" (1974), these laws were upheld despite arguments made under the Canadian Bill of Rights. The \"Indian Act\" was amended in 1985 (Bill C-31) to restore status to people who had lost it in one of these ways, and to their children.\n\nBonita Lawrence (2003) discusses a feminist position on the relationship between federal definition and Indian identity in Canada. Until 1985, subsection 12(1)(b) of the act \"discriminated against Indian women by stripping them and their descendants of their Indian status if they married a man without Indian status.\" Under subsection 12(2) of the act, \"'illegitimate' children of status Indian women could also lose status if the alleged father was known not to be a status Indian and if the child's status as an Indian was \"protested\" by the Indian agent.\" Further, subparagraph 12(1)(a)(iv), which Lawrence calls the \"double mother\" clause, \"removed status from children when they reached the age of 21 if their mother and paternal grandmother did not have status before marriage.\" Much of the discrimination stems from the \"Indian Act\" amendments and modifications in 1951.\n\nShe discusses the struggles of Jeannette Corbiere Lavell and Yvonne B√©dard in the early 1970s, two women who had both lost their Indian status for marrying white men. The Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the \"Indian Act\" was not discriminatory, as the pair gained the legal rights of white women at the same time they lost the status of Indian women, in a parallel to \"R. v. Drybones\" (supra). In 1981, Sandra Lovelace, a Maliseet woman from western New Brunswick forced the issue by taking her case to the United Nations Human Rights Committee, contending that she should not have to lose her own status by her marriage. The Canadian law was amended in 1985.\n\nIn the 1951 amendments to the \"Indian Act\", paragraph 12(1)(b) initiated that a status Indian woman who married a man who was not a status Indian became non-status. Subjecting Aboriginal female status to that of their father or husband, the Canadian government applied gender bias requirements to the legal status of Aboriginal peoples in Canada. Without legal status, Aboriginal women are unable to access treaty benefits, practice inherent rights to live on their reserve, inherit family property or be buried on reserve with ancestors. Restricted from access to their native community, Aboriginal women without legal status were unable to participate in ceremonies and rituals on their traditional land. However, these conditions did not apply to status Indian men who married non-status women; these men were able to keep their status. Section 12, paragraph 1(b) of the \"Indian Act\" worked to disadvantage the position of Aboriginal women and can be considered an attempt to demolish Aboriginal families and alienate Aboriginal women from their land. Inflicting gender discriminatory laws the Canadian government marginalized and disadvantaged Aboriginal women. Section 12 gained the attention of female movements contributing to a variety of proposals for reform. Amended in 1985 through the introduction of Bill C-31, section 12 was removed and status was reinstated to those affected.\n\nAs stated in Bill C-31 women who lost their status as a result of marrying a man who was not a status Indian can apply for reinstatement and regain status under subsection 6(1). However, the children of reinstated women are subject to registration under subsection 6(2). Aboriginal people registered under section 6(2) are unable to transmit status to future generations. Thus, by reinstating women under section 6 of the \"Indian Act\" the Canadian government failed to completely remove gender discrimination from its legislation. Since, the children of reinstated women have restrictions on their status, and status Indian men continue to hold greater quality of status then women. Bill C-31 amendments create a new system for classifying status Indians that maintains gender discrimination. Patriarchy continued to be inflicted on Aboriginal peoples in Canada even after the 1985 \"Indian Act\" amendments. Female movements expressed that Bill C-31 failed to eliminate all gender discrimination from the \"Indian Act\", and in 2010 the Canadian government introduced Bill C-3 (Act to Promote Gender Equality in Indian Registration).\n\nBill C-3 amendments to the \"Indian Act\" (Gender Equity in Indian Registration Act - GEIRA) permitted Aboriginal women reinstated under subsection 6(2) to be eligible for 6(1) status. Creating paragraph 6(1)(c.1) registration, reinstated Aboriginal women could only be eligible for registration under 6(1) if they had non-status children. Since it was the children of Aboriginal women who had been affected by restrictions under subsection 6(2) legal registration, only women who had children were eligible to be registered under subsection 6(1) of the \"Indian Act\". Continuing to place restrictions on the status of reinstated women, Bill C-3 does not remove all gender bias provisions from the \"Indian Act\".\n\nAn 1884 amendment to the Act mandated education for Indian children, to bring them to read and write English. The now infamous Indian Residential School system subjected children to forced conversions, sickness, abuse and what has been described as an attempt at Genocide by the recent Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The Canadian Indian residential school system can be seen as an attempt to force Indians off their lands, sever family ties and diminish traditional Indian culture, for which on 11 June 2008 the government of Canada apologized.\n\nIn 1885 an amendment to the \"Indian Act\" banned the Potlach ceremony of the West Coast peoples. The Potlatch ban drove traditional ceremonies underground. A similar amendment in 1895 banned the Sun Dance of the Plains peoples, which was not lifted until 1951.\n\nA 1927 amendment (Section 141) forbid any first nation or band from retaining a lawyer for the purpose of making a claim against Canada, and further forbid them from raising money to retain a lawyer, on punishment of imprisonment.\n\nSection 87 exempts Indians from paying taxes on two types of property:\n(a) the interest of an Indian or a band in reserve lands or surrendered lands; and\n(b) the personal property of an Indian or a band situated on a reserve\n\nThe rights exclusive to Indians in the \"Indian Act\" are beyond legal challenge under the Constitution Act, 1982. Section 25 of the Constitution Act, 1982 provides that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms shall not be interpreted as negating Aboriginal, treaty or other rights of Canada's Aboriginal peoples.\n\nSection 88 of the \"Indian Act\" states that provincial laws may affect Aboriginals if they are of \"general application\", meaning that they affect other people as well as Aboriginals. Hence, provincial laws are incorporated into federal law, since otherwise the provincial laws would be unconstitutional. In \"Kruger and al. v. The Queen\" (1978), the Supreme Court found that provincial laws with a more significant impact on Aboriginals than other people can be upheld, as \"There are few laws which have a uniform impact.\"\n\nConstitutional scholar Peter Hogg argues that in \"Dick v. The Queen\" (1985), the Supreme Court \"changed its mind about the scope of s. 88.\" Section 88 could now protect provincial laws relating to primary Aboriginal issues and even limiting Aboriginal rights.\n\n\n\nNumerous failed attempts have been made by Canadian parliamentarians to repeal or replace the \"Indian Act\" without success. Those changes that have been made have been piecemeal reforms, rather than sweeping revisions.\n\n\nSince the 1990s, several pieces of legislation have been passed allowing individual bands to opt out of a particular section of the \"Indian Act\" if an agreement is signed between the band and the government putting alternative measures in place. These are called \"Sectoral Legislative Arrangements\". The band remains subject to the \"Act\" except for the section in question.\n\nThe 1895 amendment of the \"Indian Act\" (Section 114) criminalized many Aboriginal ceremonies, which resulted in the arrest and conviction of numerous Aboriginal people for practising their basic traditions. These arrests were based on Aboriginal participation in festivals, dances and ceremonies that involved the wounding of animals or humans, or the giving away of money or goods. The Dakota people (Sioux) who settled in Oak River, Manitoba, in 1875 were known to conduct \"give-away dances\", also known as the \"grass dance\". The dance ceremony involved the giving away and exchange of blankets and horses; thus it breached Section 114 of the \"Indian Act\". As a result, Wanduta, an elder of the Dakota community, was sentenced to four months of hard labour and imprisonment on January 26, 1903.\n\nAccording to Canadian historian Constance Backhouse, the Aboriginal \"give-away dances\" were ceremonies more commonly known as potlatches that connected entire communities politically, economically and socially. These dances affirmed kinship ties, provided elders with opportunities to pass on insight, legends and history to the next generation, and were a core part of Aboriginal resistance to assimilation. It is estimated that between 1900 and 1904, 50 Aboriginal people were arrested and 20 were convicted for their involvement in such dances. The \"Indian Act\" was amended in 1951 to allow religious ceremonies, including the \"give-away dance\".\n\nIn \"R. v. Jim\" (1915), the British Columbia Supreme Court found that Aboriginal hunting on Indian reserves should be considered under federal jurisdiction under both the constitution and the \"Indian Act\". The case involved whether Aboriginals were subject to provincial game laws when hunting on Indian reserves.\n\nThe act was at the centre of the 1969 Supreme Court case \"R. v. Drybones\", regarding the conflict of a clause forbidding Indians to be drunk off the reserve with the Bill of Rights. The case is remembered for having been one of the few in which the Bill of Rights prevailed in application to Indian rights.\n\nIn \"Corbiere v. Canada\" (1999), voting rights on reserves were extended under Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "15028", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15028", "title": "International Seabed Authority", "text": "International Seabed Authority\n\nThe International Seabed Authority (ISA) () is an intergovernmental body based in Kingston, Jamaica, that was established to organize, regulate and control all mineral-related activities in the international seabed area beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, an area underlying most of the world‚Äôs oceans. It is an organization established by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\n\nFollowing at least ten preparatory meetings over the years, the Authority held its first inaugural meeting in its host country, Jamaica, on 16 November 1994, the day the Convention came into force. The articles governing the Authority have been made \"noting the political and economic changes, including market-oriented approaches, affecting the implementation\" of the Convention. The Authority obtained its observer status to the United Nations in October 1996.\n\nCurrently, the Authority has 167 members and the European Union, composed of all parties to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\n\nTwo principal organs establish the policies and govern the work of the Authority: the Assembly, in which all members are represented, and a 36-member Council elected by the Assembly. Council members are chosen according to a formula designed to ensure equitable representation of countries from various groups, including those engaged in seabed mineral exploration and the land-based producers of minerals found on the seabed. The Authority holds one annual session, usually of two weeks' duration.\n\nAlso established is a 30-member Legal and Technical Commission which advises the Council and a 15-member Finance Committee that deals with budgetary and related matters. All members are experts nominated by governments and elected to serve in their individual capacity.\n\nThe Authority operates by contracting with private and public corporations and other entities authorizing them to explore, and eventually exploit, specified areas on the deep seabed for mineral resources essential for building most technological products. The Convention also established a body called the Enterprise which is to serve as the Authority‚Äôs own mining operator, but no concrete steps have been taken to bring this into being.\n\nThe Authority currently has a Secretariat of 37 authorized posts and a biennial budget of $9.1 million for 2017 and $8.9 million for 2018. In July 2016, the Assembly of the Authority elected Michael Lodge of the United Kingdom, for a four-year term as Secretary-General beginning 1 January 2017. He succeeds Nii Allotey Odunton of Ghana, who had served two consecutive four-year terms since 2008.\n\nThe exploitation system envisaged in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, overseen by the Authority, came to life with the signature in 2001/02 of 15-year contracts with seven organizations that had applied for specific seabed areas in which they were authorized to explore for polymetallic nodules. In 2006, a German entity was added to the list.\n\nThese contractors are: Yuzhmorgeologya (Russian Federation); Interoceanmetal Joint Organization (IOM) (Bulgaria, Cuba, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Poland and Russian Federation); the Government of the Republic of Korea; China Ocean Minerals Research and Development Association (COMRA) (China); Deep Ocean Resources Development Company (DORD) (Japan); Institut fran√ßais de recherche pour l‚Äôexploitation de la mer (IFREMER) (France); the Government of India, the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources of Germany.\n\nAll but one of the current areas of exploration are in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, in the Equatorial North Pacific Ocean south and southeast of Hawaii. The remaining area, being explored by India, is in the Central Indian Basin of the Indian Ocean.\n\nEach area is limited to , of which half is to be relinquished to the Authority after eight years. Each contractor is required to report once a year on its activities in its assigned area. So far, none of them has indicated any serious move to begin commercial exploitation.\n\nIn 2008, the Authority received two new applications for authorization to explore for polymetallic nodules, coming for the first time from private firms in developing island nations of the Pacific. Sponsored by their respective governments, they were submitted by Nauru Ocean Resources Inc. and Tonga Offshore Mining Limited. A 15-year exploration contract was granted by the Authority to Nauru Ocean Resources Inc. on 22 July 2011 and to Tonga Offshore Mining Limited on 12 January 2012.\n\nFifteen-year exploration contracts for polymetallic nodules were also granted to G-TECH Sea Mineral Resources NV (Belgium) on the 14 January 2013; Marawa Research and Exploration Ltd (Kiribati) on the 19 January 2015; Ocean Mineral Singapore Pte Ltd on 22 January 2015; UK Seabed Resources Ltd (two contracts on the 8 February 2013 and 29 March 2016 respectively); Cook Islands Investment Corporation on the 15 July 2016 and more recently China Minmetals Corporation on 12 May 2017.\n\nThe Authority has signed seven contracts for the exploration for polymetallic sulphides in the South West Indian Ridge, Central Indian Ridge and Mid-Atlantic Ridge with China Ocean Mineral Resources Research and Development Association (18 November 2011); the Government of Russia (29 October 2012); Government of the Republic of Korea (24 June 2014); Institut fran√ßais de recherche pour l‚Äôexploitation de la mer (Ifremer,France, 18 November 2014); the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources of Germany (6 May 2015); and the Government of India (26 September 2016) and the Government of the Republic of Poland (12 February 2018).\n\nThe Authority also holds five contracts for the exploration of cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts in the Western Pacific Ocean with China Ocean Mineral Resources Research and Development Association (29 April 2014); Japan Oil Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC, 27 January 2014); Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of the Russian Federation (10 March 2015), Companhia De Pesquisa de Recursos Minerais (9 November 2015) and the Government of the Republic of Korea (27 March 2018).\n\nThe Authority's main legislative accomplishment to date has been the adoption, in the year 2000, of regulations governing exploration for polymetallic nodules. These resources, also called manganese nodules, contain varying amounts of manganese, cobalt, copper and nickel. They occur as potato-sized lumps scattered about on the surface of the ocean floor, mainly in the central Pacific Ocean but with some deposits in the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe Council of the Authority began work, in August 2002, on another set of regulations, covering polymetallic sulfides and cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts, which are rich sources of such minerals as copper, iron, zinc, silver and gold, as well as cobalt. The sulphides are found around volcanic hot springs, especially in the western Pacific Ocean, while the crusts occur on oceanic ridges and elsewhere at several locations around the world. The Council decided in 2006 to prepare separate sets of regulations for sulphides and for crusts, with priority given to sulphides. It devoted most of its sessions in 2007 and 2008 to this task, but several issues remained unresolved. Chief among these were the definition and configuration of the area to be allocated to contractors for exploration, the fees to be paid to the Authority and the question of how to deal with any overlapping claims that might arise. Meanwhile, the Legal and Technical Commission reported progress on ferromanganese crusts.\n\nIn addition to its legislative work, the Authority organizes annual workshops on various aspects of seabed exploration, with emphasis on measures to protect the marine environment from any harmful consequences. It disseminates the results of these meetings through publications. Studies over several years covering the key mineral area of the Central Pacific resulted in a technical study on biodiversity, species ranges and gene flow in the abyssal Pacific nodule province, with emphasis on predicting and managing the impacts of deep seabed mining A workshop at Manoa, Hawaii, in October 2007 produced a rationale and recommendations for the establishment of \"preservation reference areas\" in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, where nodule mining would be prohibited in order to leave the natural environment intact. The most recent workshop, held at Chennai, India, in February 2008, concerned polymetallic nodule mining technology, with special reference to its current status and challenges ahead \n\nContrary to early hopes that seabed mining would generate extensive revenues for both the exploiting countries and the Authority, no technology has yet been developed for gathering deep-sea minerals at costs that can compete with land-based mines. Until recently, the consensus has been that economic mining of the ocean depths might be decades away. Moreover, the United States, with some of the most advanced ocean technology in the world, has not yet ratified the Law of the Sea Convention and is thus not a member of the Authority.\n\nIn recent years, however, interest in deep-sea mining, especially with regard to ferromanganese crusts and polymetallic sulphides, has picked up among several firms now operating in waters within the national zones of Papua New Guinea, Fiji and Tonga. Papua New Guinea was the first country in the world to grant commercial exploration licenses for seafloor massive sulphide deposits when it granted the initial license to Nautilus Minerals in 1997. Japan‚Äôs new ocean policy emphasizes the need to develop methane hydrate and hydrothermal deposits within Japan‚Äôs exclusive economic zone and calls for the commercialization of these resources within the next 10 years. Reporting on these developments in his annual report to the Authority in April 2008, Secretary-General Nandan referred also to the upward trend in demand and prices for cobalt, copper, nickel and manganese, the main metals that would be derived from seabed mining, and he noted that technologies being developed for offshore extraction could be adapted for deep sea mining.\n\nIn its preamble, UNCLOS defines the international seabed area‚Äîthe part under ISA jurisdiction‚Äîas ‚Äúthe seabed and ocean floor and the subsoil thereof, beyond the limits of national jurisdiction‚Äù. There are no maps annexed to the Convention to delineate this area. Rather, UNCLOS outlines the areas of national jurisdiction, leaving the rest for the international portion. National jurisdiction over the seabed normally leaves off at seaward from baselines running along the shore, unless a nation can demonstrate that its continental shelf is naturally prolonged beyond that limit, in which case it may claim up to . ISA has no role in determining this boundary. Rather, this task is left to another body established by UNCLOS, the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, which examines scientific data submitted by coastal states that claim a broader reach. Maritime boundaries between states are generally decided by bilateral negotiation (sometimes with the aid of judicial bodies), not by ISA.\n\nRecently, there has been much interest in the possibility of exploiting seabed resources in the Arctic Ocean, bordered by Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Russia and the United States (see Territorial claims in the Arctic). Mineral exploration and exploitation activities in any seabed area not belonging to these states would fall under ISA jurisdiction.\n\nIn 2006 the Authority established an Endowment Fund to Support Collaborative Marine Scientific Research on the International Seabed Area. The Fund will aid experienced scientists and technicians from developing countries to participate in deep-sea research organized by international and national institutions. A campaign was launched in February 2008 to identify participants, establish a network of cooperating bodies and seek outside funds to augment the initial $3 million endowment from the Authority.\n\nThe International Seabed Authority Endowment Fund promotes and encourages the conduct of collaborative marine scientific research in the international seabed area through two main activities:\n\nThe Secretariat of the International Seabed Authority is facilitating these activities by creating and maintaining an ongoing list of opportunities for scientific collaboration, including research cruises, deep-sea sample analysis, and training and internship programmes. This entails building a network of co-operating groups interested in (or presently undertaking) these types of activities and programmes, such as universities, institutions, contractors with the Authority and other entities.\n\nThe Secretariat is also actively seeking applications from scientists and other technical personnel from developing nations to be considered for assistance under the Fund. Application guidelines have been prepared for potential recipients to participate in marine scientific research programmes or other scientific co-operation activity, to enroll in training programmes, and to qualify for technical assistance. An advisory panel will evaluate all incoming applications and make recommendations to the Secretary-General of the International Seabed Authority so successful applicants may be awarded with Fund assistance.\n\nTo maximize opportunities for and participation in the Fund, the Secretariat is also seeking donations and in-kind contributions to build on the initial investment of US$3 million. This entails raising awareness of the Fund, reporting on its successes and encouraging new activities and participants.\n\nIn 2017, the Authority registered seven voluntary commitments with the UN Oceans Conference for Sustainable Development Goal 14. These were:\n\nThe exact nature of the ISA's mission and authority has been questioned by opponents of the Law of the Sea Treaty who are generally skeptical of multilateral engagement by the United States. The United States is the only major maritime power that has not ratified the Convention (see United States non-ratification of the UNCLOS), with one of the main anti-ratification arguments being a charge that the ISA is flawed or unnecessary. In its original form, the Convention included certain provisions that some found objectionable, such as:\n\nBecause of these concerns, the United States pushed for modification of the Convention, obtaining a 1994 Agreement on Implementation that somewhat mitigates them and thus modifies the ISA's authority. Despite this change the United States has not ratified the Convention and so is not a member of ISA, although it sends sizable delegations to participate in meetings as an observer.\n\n\n"}

The practice of communicating a lie is called lying; a person who communicates a lie may be termed a liar.

Generally, the term \"lie\" carries a negative connotation and, depending on the context, a person who communicates a lie may be subject to social, legal, religious, or criminal sanctions.\n\nIn England, if the prosecution seeks to rely on the fact the defendant lied (to police, for example), it is sometimes necessary for the judge to give the jury what is known as a \"Lucas\" direction.\n\nA \"Lucas\" direction is not used where the prosecution attempts to show the defendant committed the crime, and, if the jury finds the defendant guilty, this would mean the defendant had lied. The direction \"comes into play when the prosecution says, or the judge envisages that the jury may say, that the lie is evidence against the accused, in effect using it as an implied admission of guilt ... this is quite distinct from the run of the mill case in which the defence case is contradicted by the evidence of the prosecution witnesses in such a way as to make it necessary for the prosecution to say ... that the defendant's account is untrue and indeed deliberately and knowingly false\".

Lines. On 17 June 2013, she broke into two about off the coast of Yemen. The aft section sank on 27 June and the bow section, after having been destroyed by fire, on 11 July.\n\nOne of twelve ships of similar design, \"MOL Comfort\" was laid down at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Nagasaki shipyard in Japan on 23 August 2007 and launched on 8 March 2008 as APL Russia for charter to APL (formerly American President Lines). She was completed on 14 July 2008. On 1 June 2012, \"APL Russia\" was transferred to Mitsui O.S.K. Lines' Europe-Asia route and renamed \"MOL Comfort\".\n\nOn 17 June 2013, \"MOL Comfort\" suffered a crack amidships in bad weather about off the coast of Yemen and eventually broke into two after hogging. The vessel was underway from Singapore to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, with a cargo of 4,382 containers equivalent to 7,041 TEU. The crew of 26‚Äî11 Russians, one Ukrainian and 14 Filipinos‚Äîabandoned the ship and were rescued from two life rafts and a lifeboat by the German-flagged container ship \"Yantian Express\", one of three vessels diverted to the site of incident by ICG Mumbai. After the structural failure, both sections remained afloat with the majority of the cargo intact and began drifting in an east-northeast direction. Smit Salvage Singapore was contracted to tow the sections to safety.\n\nOn 24 June, four oceangoing tugboats arrived at the scene and began towing the bow section to safety. However, before any salvage operations of the stern section could commence, water ingress was reported on 26 June. On the following day, the stern sank at to a depth of . Some of the approximately 1,700 containers on board were later confirmed floating near the site. While no major oil leak was reported, the stern section was said to contain about 1,500 tons of fuel.\n\nOn 2 July, the tow of the bow section broke free in bad weather but the towing line was reattached the next day. On 6 July a fire broke out in the rear part of the bow section. Unable to get the blaze under control in bad weather the salvage vessels asked for help from an Indian Coast Guard patrol boat with external fire fighting equipment. By 10 July most of the 2,400 containers on board had been destroyed by fire. The damaged bow section sank the next night at to a depth of with what remained of the cargo and 1,600 metric tons of fuel oil in the tanks. No spill apart from a thin oil film on the surface has been reported, but some containers were spotted floating around the sinking site. The cause of the fire remains unknown.\n\nThe exact cause of the accident is not known. On 4 July, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines appointed Lloyd's Register to support investigations into the cause of the incident. As a precaution, the sister ships of \"MOL Comfort\" were withdrawn from the same route and their hull structures will be upgraded to increase the longitudinal strength. In addition, operational changes will be carried out to reduce the stresses on the vessels' hulls.\n\nThe sinking of \"MOL Comfort\" cost the insurers between 300 and 400 million dollars in claims. The hull and machinery of the vessel were insured for $66 million. By December 2014, the insurers (Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Co.) were among 100 companies, including Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd., who had launched lawsuits against MHI, reportedly on the grounds that the accident and consequent loss of ship and cargo was caused by a design flaw in the freighter.\n\nWith an overall length of long, moulded beam of and fully laden draught of , \"MOL Comfort\" was too large to transit the Panama canal and was thus referred to as a post-Panamax container ship. She measured 86,692 in gross tonnage and 48,825 in net tonnage, and had a deadweight tonnage of 90,613 tonnes. The container capacity of the ship, measured in twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU), was 8,110 of which 4,616 TEU is stored on the deck and 3,494 TEU in the holds.\n\nLike most large container ships, \"MOL Comfort\" was propelled by a single low-speed two-stroke crosshead diesel engine coupled to a fixed-pitch propeller. Her main engine, a 11-cylinder licence-manufactured Mitsubishi-Sulzer 11RT-flex96C, was rated at at 102 rpm and was capable of propelling the ship at . She also had six auxiliary diesel generators with a combined output of 14,625kVA.\n\nThe hatch side coamings in modern container ships are subjected to the highest stress of all structural members in the ship. This is due to the large openings in the strength deck needed for loading and unloading containers in the cargo holds. Plate thicknesses up to are used to keep the stress levels acceptable. \"MOL Comfort\"'s sister ship, 2007-built \"MOL Creation\", was the first container ship classified by Nippon Kaiji Kyokai to use ultra-high-strength steel with a yield strength of 470MPa in these structures to reduce the steel weight by avoiding extreme plate thicknesses.\n"}

{"id": "35946447", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35946447", "title": "Mueller v. Allen", "text": "Mueller v. Allen\n\nMueller v. Allen, 463 U.S. 388 (1983), was a United States Supreme Court case examining the constitutionality of a state tax deduction granted to taxpaying parents for school-related expenses, including expenses incurred from private secular and religious schools. The plaintiffs claimed that a Minnesota statute, allowing tax deductions for both public and private school expenses, had the effect of subsidizing religious instruction since parents who paid tuition to religious schools received a larger deduction than parents of public school students, who incurred no tuition expenses.\n\nIn a 5-4 decision, the Court upheld the statute. The majority affirmed that the benefit was religiously neutral because the deduction applied equally to sectarian and nonsectarian tuition and that the choice of religious or nonreligious instruction was made by individual parents, not the state. Also, aid was given to parents, not schools.\n\nThe dissenting opinion argued that the tax deduction violated the US Constitution because it was an indirect government subsidy of religion, providing a financial incentive to parents to send their children to religious schools.\n\nThe First Amendment of the US Constitution prohibits laws advancing the establishment of any religion. Any government-sponsored religious instruction is thus barred. Prior to the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Supreme Court's reviews of First Amendment disputes were minimal because the court maintained jurisdiction to consider only challenges against laws passed at the federal level.\n\n\"Everson v. Board of Education\" (1947) was the first case decided by the Court to apply the Establishment Clause prohibition to state laws. The decision in \"Everson\" established two criteria to judge state legislation: the action must have a secular purpose, and that purpose must be the primary effect of the action. Following a 1971 decision by the Supreme Court, a third condition was incorporated. The resulting three-pronged test, called \"Lemon\" test, prescribes that for any governmental policy or legislation to satisfy the Establishment Clause, it must have a secular purpose, its primary effect must not the advancement or inhibition of religion, and it must not create an excessive entanglement between religion and government.\n\nIn \"Mueller\", the plaintiff claimed that the primary effect of the Minnesota law was the advancement of religion since most taxpayers who benefited from the legislation were parents paying their children's tuition to private religious schools.\n\nJustice Rehnquist delivered the majority opinion, which affirmed the decisions of the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota and the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit that the Minnesota statute (¬ß 290.09, subd. 22) was constitutional. The law allowed state taxpayers to a state income tax deduction for any expenses toward their children's school tuition, textbooks, and transportation. The deduction was limited to $500 per student in elementary school and $700 per student in middle school and high school. The statute excluded deducting any expenses for \"instructional books and materials used in the teaching of religious tenets, doctrines or worship, the purpose of which is to inculcate such tenets, doctrines or worship.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs were unsuccessful in contending that the tax deduction provided financial assistance to religious schools and that to assure no deduction was made for textbooks containing religious teachings, the state became excessively entangled with religion.\n\nRehnquist noted that the statute was facially neutral on religion and rejected the plaintiff's argument that its religious partiality was evidenced by the fact that 96% of the private schools in Minnesota were sectarian institutions.\n\nJustice Marshall wrote the dissenting opinion, agreed to by three other justices. The tax credits were available to all parents, but, in practice, the chief benefit went to parents whose children attended parochial schools. \"Parents who send their children to free public schools are simply ineligible to obtain the full benefit of the deduction except in the unlikely event that they buy $700 worth of pencils, notebooks, and bus rides for their children.\" As the First Amendment was concerned, Marshall added, a tax credit did not differ from a direct grant to parents, which had already been found unconstitutional.\n\n\"Mueller v. Allen\" marked a turning point for the Establishment Clause, and for the next 20 years the Supreme Court ruled more favorably if governments fostered aid. The Court upheld benefits that were deemed to be religiously neutral and were extended to all equally, even if they were favorable to individuals in exercising their privately-held religious interests. The Court became disinclined to overturn laws that did not disqualify religiously based interests if the direct beneficiaries of the legislation in question were individuals, rather than religiously-affiliated institutions.\n\nFollowin \"Mueller\", \"private choice\" was a key element extended to subsequent Establishment Clause court decisions over government sponsored school vouchers, the most significant one being \"Zelman v. Simmons-Harris\" (2002). While direct aid was funneled instead to religious schools, the Court focused instead on whether or not the policies at issue provided sufficient controls to ensure the assistance was not directed to religious instruction and that the e policies did not lead to forbidden entanglements between the government and any religious institution.\n\n\n"}

Although it is advised for parents to name their children so that others are able to easily read their names, there are no restrictions on the complexity of Chinese characters used, provided that there are no technical issues in doing so (see below). The use of Simplified characters is advised over Traditional Chinese characters; however, this is not strictly enforced.\n\n\"\" Article 99 guarantees citizens the right to a name and the choice of naming therein. The right of self-naming permits the surname, although naturally obtained from the paternal side, to be taken from either parent if desired (such as in the case of a dispute between parents) under Article 22 of the \"Marriage Law\". Thus, the government does not interfere with the will of the person or their parents in the selection of a surname, provided that it is taken from one parent. Citizens also have the right to select their given names and aliases, in which the government has no right to interfere.\n\nThere are also no restrictions on previously used names by the government, which fully permits the usage of \"well-known\" names. It is not illegal to name a child after a famous celebrity, company, or product, as copyright and trademark laws do not apply to personal names. Consequently, this is able to lead to legal issues regarding intellectual property rights and legal matters, as the person is then known by the name given according to law, which opens the possibility for confusion where a personal name is exactly the same to a company or another person, such as during a court case or the creation of legal documents.\n\nLatin characters, numerals and other non-Chinese symbols are prohibited, as they do not constitute part of a Chinese name under government law. Only Chinese characters are permitted; however, characters which are unable to be input on computers are also disallowed. There are no limits on the number of characters used, as this may vary depending on the name (typical Chinese names on average constitute 2 to 3 characters, with 4 or more characters being rare; however, non-Han ethnic groups such as Mongols, Tibetans and Uighurs have many syllables after transliteration into Standard Chinese).\n\nThere are no laws which restrict a person's surname to one character like most Han Chinese names, since some people of Han Chinese ethnicity have Chinese compound surnames, and it is very common for foreign residents and ethnic minorities to have long surname transcriptions. However, since the People's Republic of China government does not recognise Mongolian clan names as surnames, persons of Mongol ethnicity usually only have a registered given name and no surname (which are absent on their identification cards, whilst their passports would have \"XXX\" in the surname field), although some individuals choose to adopt a single-character Han Chinese surname that resembles an abbreviation of their clan name.\n\nThere are over 70,000 known Chinese characters, yet approximately only 32,232 are supported for computer input, including both Traditional and Simplified characters (see GBK (character encoding) etc.). As the government database of personal names is maintained digitally on government networks, input of rarer characters becomes virtually impossible, thus creating an irremovable restriction on permitted names. All citizens within the People's Republic of China must have their details registered on the government computer network, while those over the age of 16 must carry an identification card, known in China as a Resident Identity Card at all times. As these processes are all done electronically, having a name which is not supported by electronic input makes government registration and the management of ID cards much more difficult.\n\nIn 2017, the Chinese Communist Party enacted bans on a list of Muslim names it deemed \"too extreme\", or may have \"connotations of holy war or of splittism (separatism)\". Examples include \"Islam\", \"Quran\", \"Mecca\", \"Jihad\", \"Imam\", \"Saddam\", \"Hajj\", and \"Medina\", among others.\n\nMa Cheng ( (some browsers will be unable to display the second character , which is three È¶¨ horses placed horizontally), ) is a woman from Beijing who, due to her obscure name, frequently encounters issues regarding name registration in places such as airports and police stations. Ma explained on BTV-7 that her parents were inspired by a trend where given names are made up of a tripled surname, as in Jin Xin ÈáëÈë´, Xiao Mo Â∞èÂ∞õ, Yu Xian È≠öÈ±ª and Shi Lei Áü≥Á£ä, and so her grandfather found her name in the \"Zhonghua Zihai\", the largest Chinese character dictionary. Pronounced \"Cheng\", this character can be found in the \"Kangxi Dictionary\", where it is listed as a variant character of È™ã (gallop). There is also the comparatively more common stacked character È™â, which doesn't accurately reflect her name either, as it has a different pronunciation. While some vendors may write her name by hand, those that are strictly electronically managed, such as the Public Security Bureau, are unable to correctly enter her name. Because of this, some computers record her name as È©¨CHENG or È©¨È©¨È©¨È©¨. (Compare this practice with the previous technical issues of inputting the Chinese name of the Taiwanese singer David Tao (), where before the input of \"zhe\" ÂñÜ became supported on computers, many media sources often rendered his name as Tao Jiji Èô∂ÂêâÂêâ, using two \"ji\" Âêâ in place of the \"zhe\" ÂñÜ.)\n\nZhao C () is a well-known example, having attracted much media attention due to a bizarre case regarding a forced name change by the government due to naming regulations. This case is the first of name rights in the People's Republic of China. Zhao, whose personal name is the Latin alphabet letter C, can no longer use his name, as the government does not accept Latin characters in Chinese names. The 22-year-old man, having used the given name \"C\" for his entire life, was refused the right to continue using his name when he was required to update his ID card to a second-generation version. The local Public Security Bureau informed him that his name violated the rules, and that their computers were not equipped to handle non-standard characters. In Pinyin, his name has a pronunciation similar to c√≠ (Èõå), rather than xƒ´ (Ë•ø). Zhao could not continue using his name despite a court hearing, as he did not provide the lower court with evidence that the Latin character \"C\" is part of the national standard for \"numbers and symbols\" of the People's Republic of China.\n\nWang \"At\" () is the name that a Chinese couple attempted to give to their newborn baby. It was subsequently rejected. The couple claimed that the character used in e-mail addresses echoed their love for the child, where in Chinese, \"@\" is pronounced as \"ai-ta\", which is similar to Áà±‰ªñ, literally \"love him\".\n\n\n"}

It is granted against a third party which has been innocently mixed up in wrongdoing, forcing the disclosure of documents or information. By identifying individuals the documents and information sought are disclosed in order to assist the applicant for such an order in bringing legal proceedings against individuals who are believed to have wronged the applicant.\n\nA Norwich Pharmacal order was first granted in 1974 by the House of Lords in \"Norwich Pharmacal Co. v Customs and Excise Commissioners\", a case concerning the alleged violation of a patent by unknown importers of the chemical subject to the patent. While first developed in relation to intellectual property, Norwich Pharmacal orders are now granted in relation to other torts, including defamation and breach of contract, as well as alleged criminal offences. More recently Norwich Pharmacal orders are used against Internet hosting services and Internet service providers to identify users which have allegedly engaged in wrongdoing.\n\nIn 2011, it was proposed that Norwich Pharmacal orders should not be granted by the UK courts where disclosure of the material in question would cause damage to the public interest. This was implemented in the Justice and Security Act 2013.\n\nIn \"Norwich Pharmacal Co. v Customs and Excise Commissioners\", the House of Lords held that where an innocent third party has information relating to unlawful conduct, a court could compel them to assist the person suffering damage by giving them that information. The judgement is based on the 19th Century procedure known as the \"bill of discovery\" and the case was brought by Norwich Pharmacal Co., the owner of the patent for a chemical. Norwich knew that its patent was infringed, because the chemical was imported into the UK, but it was unable to identify the alleged wrongdoer. It brought proceedings against HM Customs and Excise to force the Commissioners to disclose the names of the importers, which were the \"Intended Defendants\".\n\nNorwich Pharmacal orders are typically sought when legal proceedings for alleged wrongdoing cannot be brought because the identity of the wrongdoer is not known. Parties which believe they have been wronged will apply for a Norwich Pharmacal order to the court against third parties who can identify the wrongdoer, because they unwittingly facilitate the wrongdoing. In the judgement granting the first Norwich Pharmacal order Lord Reid summarised the principle of the Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction as follows:\n\nAn application for a Norwich Pharmacal order must be commenced against the facilitator by issuing a claim form. In the case of alleged tort an interim application must be made to a master in the Queen's Bench Division or the Chancery Division in the High Court of Justice. The Civil Procedure Rules (CPR) 31.17 outline the procedures of the Norwich Pharmacal jurisdiction in England and Wales. Norwich Pharmacal orders are not restricted to cases where such an order is a last resort - it is \"intended to be a... flexible remedy.\"\n\nThe nature of the relief has been summarized thus:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "386262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=386262", "title": "Peace of Callias", "text": "Peace of Callias\n\nThe Peace of Callias is a purported treaty established around 449 BC between the Delian League (led by Athens) and Persia, ending the Greco-Persian Wars. The peace was agreed as the first compromise treaty between Achaemenid Persia and a Greek city.\n\nThe peace was negotiated by Callias, an Athenian politician. Persia had continually lost territory to the Greeks after the end of Xerxes I's invasion in 479 BC. The exact date of the treaty is debated, although it is usually placed after the Battle of the Eurymedon in 469 or 466 or the Battle of Cypriot Salamis in 450. The Peace of Callias gave autonomy to the Ionian states in Asia Minor, prohibited the encroachment of Persian satrapies within three days march of the Aegean coast, and prohibited Persian ships from the Aegean. Athens also agreed not to interfere with Persia's possessions in Asia Minor, Cyprus, Libya or Egypt (Athens had recently lost a fleet aiding an Egyptian revolt against Persia).\n\nOur knowledge of the Peace of Callias comes from references by the 4th century BC orators Isocrates and Demosthenes as well as the historian Diodorus. The ancient historian Theopompus deemed it a fabrication arguing that the inscription of the treaty was a fake ‚Äì the lettering used hadn't come into practice until half a century after the treaty was purported to have been agreed. It is possible that the treaty never officially existed, and if it was concluded, its importance is disputed. Thucydides did not mention it, but Herodotus says something that may reasonably be construed as supporting its existence, as does Plutarch, who thought it had either been signed after the Battle of the Eurymedon in 466 BC, or that it had never been signed at all. In any case, there seems to have been some agreement reached ending hostilities with Persia after 450/449, which allowed Athens to deal with the new threats from the other Greek states such as Corinth and Thebes, as well as Euboea which rebelled from the Delian League shortly after this. These conflicts may have arisen when Athenian 'allies' felt there was no longer a justification for the Delian League (which had developed from the Spartan-led Hellenic League that defeated Xerxes' invasion), as Persia was apparently no longer a threat. As Athens demanded more and more tribute and exerted more political and economic control over its allies, the League became more of a true empire, and many of Athens' 'allies' began to rebel. Although Callias was also responsible for a peace (The Thirty Years' Peace) with Sparta in 446‚Äì445 BC, the growing Athenian threat would eventually lead to the Peloponnesian War.\n\nFighting between the Greeks and the Persians subsided after 450, but Persia continued to meddle in Greek affairs and was to become instrumental in securing a Spartan victory in the Peloponnesian War.\n\nNonetheless, it remains a controversial topic among historians and scholars today.\n\n\n"}

Unlike \"bottom of the harbour\" and similar schemes that strictly focus on asset stripping, the new company is set up to trade in the same or similar trading activities as the former, and is able to present the appearance of \"business as usual\" to its customers. It has been described as \"one that arises amidst or from the disarray and demise of its predecessor.\"\n\nA study by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission has identified three groups of operators that practice phoenix activity:\n\nSuch activity can also be characterized as either \"basic\" (involving replacement of one entity by another) or \"sophisticated\" (which has regard for the intricacies of corporate groups, where management and directors may misuse the concept of the corporate veil).\n\nCertain sectors see more frequent phoenix activity than others. In the events industry, public relations and marketing agencies are known to \"phoenix\" regularly.\n\nPhoenix activity is generally observed to occur through the following scenarios:\n\nThe primary identifiers of phoenix activity have been described as \"a deliberate and often cyclical misuse of the corporate form accompanied by a fraudulent scheme to evade creditors\". Several common characteristics have been identified as indicating harmful phoenix activity:\n\n\nCompany law in the UK has been formed to enable such activity in order to protect and promote entrepreneurship, by reducing risk and improving the chances of continued trading and business development. The National Fraud Authority has observed that:\n\nOther less scrupulous directors may undertake such activity in order to evade liabilities to workers that accrue from continuous employment, such as the right to claim for unfair dismissal, or to receive statutory redundancy payments. The Employment Appeal Tribunal has held that such moves are generally barred under s. 218 of the Employment Rights Act 1996.\n\nThe law allows the directors of a failed company to be reinstated in the same, or similar posts in the phoenix company, within limits. The Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 prohibits directors whose conduct led to the insolvency of a company from taking on similar roles elsewhere for a prescribed length of time. S. 216 of the Insolvency Act 1986 provides for both criminal and civil liability where directors or shadow directors of a company that has entered into liquidation become a director, or otherwise involved in the formation or management of another company that operates under the same or a similar name to the insolvent one, within the following twelve months of such liquidation. Remedies include petitioning the High Court to wind up a company, as in the 2014 case of Pinecom Services Limited and Pine Commodities Ltd (which had continued a business previously shut down in the public interest).\n\nThere has been criticism in both the media and in Parliamentary quarters, as to the adverse effect on small to medium-sized suppliers to a failed company, whose position as creditors leaves them having to write off bad debt from the former company, with the phoenix company having shed all liability to cover the debt. Moreover, the House of Commons' Business and Enterprise Select Committee also raised concerns that the law may \"adversely affect competitors, who will continue to carry costs which the phoenix company has shed.\"\nPhoenix activity was identified in government reports as early as 1994, and the 2003 Final Report of the Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry devoted a chapter to its practice in that sector of the economy.\n\nIt has attracted the attention of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, the Australian Taxation Office and the Fair Work Ombudsman, who have been pursuing those undertaking such practices to evade liability under their respective statutes. The Treasurer of Australia issued proposals in 2009 on options to deal with fraudulent phoenix activity, and the Parliament of Australia passed several Acts in 2012 as a result. An exposure draft was also issued for comment on the question of whether to assign joint and several liability to directors of phoenix companies in certain circumstances, but limited legislation directed at illegal phoenix activity was passed. In 2015 two significant government reports were released that included a consideration of how best to address phoenix activity: the Productivity Commission Report \"Business Set Up, Transfer and Closure,\" and the Senate Economic References Committee Report: \"I just want to be paid: Insolvency in the Australian Construction Industry.\" Despite the frequency and volume to attention given to phoenix activity by government and regulators, scholars note that \"[t]here is no law in Australia that defines 'phoenix activity' , nor declares it illegal\"; \"phoenix activity is an operational term, not a legal one\". \n\nThe economic cost of phoenix activity has been estimated in 1996 by the Australian Securities Commission, and in 2012 by the Fair Work Ombudsman. While there is economic cost associated with all phoenix activity, the underlying behaviour is not always illegal and this makes estimating the economic costs associated with illegal phoenix activity extremely difficult. \n\nEnforcement activity has been active under the \"Corporations Act\":\n\nThe Fair Work Ombudsman has also investigated several high-profile cases:\n\n\n"}

On October 30, 2017, in the case of \"Jane Doe v. Trump\", Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly granted the plaintiffs a preliminary injunction on the provisions of the memorandum prohibiting open military service and enlistment of transgender people. On November 21, 2017, in the case of \"Stone v. Trump\", Judge Marvin J. Garbis granted the planintiffs a preliminary injunction on the entirety of the Presidential Memorandum for the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security. Also that day, the United States Department of Justice appealed the preliminary injunction in the case of \"Jane Doe v. Trump\". The Pentagon's six-month delay on accession of transgender individuals into military service expired January 1, 2018.\n\nThe original policy, which this Memorandum replaced, had been blocked in 2017 (\"Jane Doe v. Trump\"), when it was ruled that as far as could be seen, \"all of the reasons proffered by the president for excluding transgender individuals from the military in this case were not merely unsupported, but were actually contradicted by the studies, conclusions and judgment of the military itself\". The 2018 policy was itself stayed on 13 April 2018 when a Washington court ruled in \"Karnoski vs. Trump\" (Western District of Washington), that the 2018 memorandum essentially repeated the same issues as its predecessor order from 2017, that transgender service members (and transgender individuals as a class) were a protected class entitled to strict scrutiny of adverse laws (or at worst, a quasi-suspect class), and ordered that matter continue to a full trial hearing on the legality of the proposed policy.\n\n\nOn August 29, 2017, Secretary James Mattis announced that currently serving transgender troops would be allowed to remain in the armed services, pending further study. Mattis stated he would set up a panel of experts from the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security to provide recommendations on implementing the President's policy direction.\n\nOn August 9, 2017, the first of four lawsuits was filed in United States District Court seeking to block the Presidential Memorandum from being implemented. \n\nOn August 9, 2017, five transgender United States military personnel filed a lawsuit, \"Jane Doe v. Trump\". They sued Trump and top Pentagon officials over the proposed banning of transgender people from serving in the military. The suit asks the court to prevent the ban from going into effect, under the auspices of the equal protection and due process clauses of the Fifth Amendment. The suit was filed on their behalf by two major LGBT-rights organizations, GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders (GLAD) and the National Center for Lesbian Rights, who filed a petition in the United States District Court in Washington. On August 31, 2017, the plaintiffs applied for a preliminary injunction on the proposed ban, stating \"it is unconstitutional\" and that \"Plaintiffs have suffered serious and irreparable harms that will continue absent this Court's intervention.\" Also on August 31, three former secretaries of military services, Eric Fanning, Ray Mabus, and Deborah Lee James, submitted declarations in support of the plaintiffs.\n\nOn October 4, the Civil Division of the Department of Justice filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint in \"Jane Doe v. Trump\" and to oppose the application for a preliminary injunction, arguing instead \"that challenge is premature several times over\" and that Secretary Mattis's Interim Guidance, issued on September 14, 2017, protects currently-serving transgender personnel from involuntary discharge or denial of reenlistment. On October 30, 2017, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly granted the plaintiffs a preliminary injunction on the provisions of the memorandum prohibiting open military service and enlistment of transgender people. The Pentagon's six-month delay on accession of transgender individuals into military service expires January 1, 2018. In the ruling, Judge Kollar-Kotelly noted the defendants' motion to dismiss the case was \"perhaps compelling in the abstract, [but] wither[s] away under scrutiny.\" The ruling effectively reinstated the policies established prior to President Trump's tweets announcing the reinstatement of the ban, namely the retention and accession policies for transgender personnel effective on June 30, 2017. However, the court denied a preliminary injunction against the ban on government-funded sex reassignment surgery for service members \"because no Plaintiff has demonstrated that they are substantially likely to be impacted by this directive.\" On November 21, 2017, the United States Department of Justice appealed the preliminary injunction in the case of \"Jane Doe v. Trump\".\n\nOn August 28, 2017, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Maryland filed a federal lawsuit, \"Stone v. Trump\", on behalf of several transgender military service members, alleging that the ban violated their equal protection rights.\n\nOn November 21, 2017, Judge Marvin J. Garbis granted the Plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction on the entirety of the Presidential Memorandum of August 25, stating in his Order \"[t]he lack of any justification for the abrupt policy change, combined with the discriminatory impact to a group of our military service members who have served our country capably and honorably, cannot possibly constitute a legitimate governmental interest.\"\n\nAlso on August 28, Lambda Legal filed a federal lawsuit, \"Karnoski v. Trump\", in Seattle on behalf of three transgender soldiers, the Human Rights Campaign, and the Gender Justice League, alleging that the ban violated equal protection, due process and free speech protections. On December 11, 2017, Judge Marsha J. Pechman issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Presidential Memorandum of August 25, stating the \"Defendants have failed to demonstrate that the policy prohibiting transgender individuals from serving openly is substantially related to important government interests\" and \"the prohibition on military service by transgender individuals was announced by President Trump on Twitter, abruptly and without any evidence of considered reason or deliberation.\"\n\nThe preliminary ruling was affirmed on 13 April 2018, and the policy stayed, in \"Karnoski vs. Trump\" (Western District of Washington), when the court ruled that the 2018 memorandum essentially repeated the same issues as its predecessor order from 2017, that transgender service members (and transgender individuals as a class) were a protected class entitled to strict scrutiny of adverse laws (or at worst, a quasi-suspect class), and ordered that matter continue to a full trial hearing on the legality of the proposed policy.\n\nOn September 5, 2017, Equality California (EQCA) filed a lawsuit, \"Stockman v. Trump\" in United States District Court for the Central District of California against the ban; the lawsuit includes four named and three unnamed transgender plaintiffs. In the complaint, which seeks an immediate injunction based on the Fifth Amendment, EQCA noted \"the stated bases offered in support of Defendants' August 25 Directive are pretextual, arbitrary, capricious, and unsupported by facts, evidence, or analysis\" and that \"transgender people have been serving openly [since 2016] without incident or any negative impact upon military readiness, lethality, unit cohesion, or the national defense generally.\" Judge Jesus G. Bernal issued an order granting the preliminary injunction and denying the motion to dismiss on December 22, 2017, writing the defendants' \"justifications fall far short of exceedingly persuasive\" and characterizing the ban as causing irreparable harm since \"[t]here is nothing any court can do to remedy a government-sent message that some citizens are not worthy of the military uniform simply because of their gender.\"\n\nOn September 15, 2017, a bipartisan bill () was introduced by senators John McCain (R-AZ), Jack Reed (D-RI), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), and Susan Collins (R-ME) to prohibit involuntarily separating or denying re-enlistment of transgender troops solely on the basis of gender identity. During his testimony before the Senate, the highest-ranking uniformed officer of the United States military, General Joseph Dunford, chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, announced his advice that any troops who have served \"with honor and value\" should continue to serve, and that gender identity is not a credible reason for involuntary discharge. A bipartisan bill with nearly identical text () was introduced in the House on October 12, 2017. It was sponsored by Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA) and co-sponsored by Charles Dent (R-PA), Susan Davis (D-CA), Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), Adam Smith (D-WA), and Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ).\n\nAs requested by the memorandum of August 25, Secretary Mattis submitted a memorandum and report regarding military service by transgender individuals. The United States Secretary of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen, concurred with Mattis's recommendations as applied to the Coast Guard. One of the recommendations made was \"that transgender persons with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria -- individuals who the policies state may require substantial medical treatment, including medications and surgery -- are disqualified from military service except under certain limited circumstances.\" On March 23, 2018, President Trump announced the prior memorandum of August 25 was revoked. With respect to future policies, the memorandum of March 23 went on to declare the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security \"may exercise their authority to implement any appropriate policies concerning military service by transgender individuals.\"\n\n"}

Such outside power can be exercised by a foreign government, in which case the puppet ruler's domain is called a puppet state. But the puppet ruler may also be controlled by internal forces, such as non-elected officials.\n\nGoverning through puppet presidents has long been a political tactic in Latin America. Many dictators and strongmen have formally handed over power to other officials for several reasons, often in order to follow constitutional provisions for elections and term limits, to provide a civilian fa√ßade for military rule, or to be able to go into semi-retirement away from the capital city. Strongmen who sometimes governed through figureheads included Diego Portales of Chile, Rafael N√∫√±ez of Colombia, Tom√°s Guardia Guti√©rrez of Costa Rica, Fulgencio Batista of Cuba, Ulises Heureaux and Rafael Trujillo of the Dominican Republic, Gabriel Garc√≠a Moreno of Ecuador, Raoul C√©dras of Haiti, Porfirio D√≠az and Plutarco El√≠as Calles of Mexico, the Somoza family of Nicaragua, Jos√© Antonio Rem√≥n Cantera, Omar Torrijos and Manuel Noriega of Panama, D√©si Bouterse of Suriname, and Antonio Guzm√°n Blanco and Juan Vicente G√≥mez of Venezuela. While figureheads who decided to act autonomously were often dismissed, on rare occasions the \"puppets\" later became significant political figures in their own right. For example, L√°zaro C√°rdenas turned against and exiled Calles to the United States and Joaqu√≠n Balaguer was elected to the Dominican presidency six times after the assassination of Trujillo.\n\nA puppet does not have to be a national ruler. For example, Oscar K. Allen was widely recognized to be Huey Long's puppet while serving as governor of Louisiana.\n\nIn the years before and during World War II, Puyi, the deposed Emperor of China, is usually considered to have been the puppet ruler of Manchukuo, a client state of the Empire of Japan on the Chinese mainland. \n\nWin Myint, the current president of Myanmar, is widely viewed by political commentators as a puppet president for Aung San Suu Kyi, who is constitutionally barred from holding the office of president.\n"}

{"id": "25703816", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25703816", "title": "Re-trade", "text": "Re-trade\n\nA Retrarde is a Norwegian is the practice of renegotiating the purchase price of real property by the buyer after initially agreeing to purchase at a higher price. Typically this occurs after the buyer gets the property under contract and during the period that it is performing due diligence. The buyer may raise a due diligence issue and demand a purchase price adjustment to a lower re-trade price. The seller can be left in a bad situation where it must either accept the lower price or lose the sale and re-market the property. Moreover, loss of the sale can affect an entire chain of related transactions (such as when the sale is a down-leg in a tax-deferred \"1031\" exchange), thereby increasing even further the pressure upon the seller to accept the lower price in order to salvage the related transactions and avoid a ripple effect.\n\nThe purpose of a due diligence period is to allow the buyer to fully investigate all of the claims, warranties, and representations a seller has made. There are times when buyers are justified in seeking an adjustment, as in the case of a discovery that certain deal fundamentals are not supportable under the scrutiny of the buyer's due diligence. Other times, however, buyers may seek to utilize perceived leverage in a transaction to drive the price down. In this scenario, the buyer fails to turn up anything significant, but still wants to lower the price. \n\nIn troubled real estate markets, like that experienced in the Great Recession of the late 2000s, it was common for some buyers to intentionally misuse the due diligence process and to initially offer a higher price than they are actually willing to pay in order to control the property and renegotiate later. This strategy preyed upon the desperation of sellers and the paucity of buyers in the market. \n\nSome sophisticated sellers are adopting the strategy of refusing to renegotiate so as not to reward the practice and to discourage re-trade buyers. On the other side of the purchase/sale transaction, some buyers attempt to distinguish themselves from the practice and pride themselves as having a strict \"no re-trade\" policy, touting that they do all their due diligence up front and don't demand last minute purchase price reductions. See, for example, AIC Ventures LP.\n\n"}
{"id": "1923534", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1923534", "title": "Renvoi", "text": "Renvoi\n\nIn conflict of laws, renvoi (from the French, meaning \"send back\" or \"to return unopened\") is a subset of the choice of law rules and it may be applied whenever a forum court is directed to consider the law of another state.\n\n\nTo limit the damage that would result from forum shopping, it is desirable that the same law be applied to achieve the same result no matter where the case is litigated. The system of renvoi is an attempt to achieve that end. If a forum court is directed to consult a foreign law, the first question it must address is whether this is a reference solely to the relevant substantive provisions, or to the state's system of law as a whole which would include its choice of law rules. Forums that do not have renvoi provisions refer only to the specific provisions of relevant law. In this way, the same outcome is achieved no matter where the case is litigated so long as the second state would also have applied its own laws.\n\nBut if that second country actually has choice of law rules requiring it to apply the forum law, a difference in outcome might arise depending on where the plaintiff invokes jurisdiction. Whether a difference actually emerges depends on whether the other state operates a \"Single Renvoi\" system. A single renvoi forum always refers to the other law's choice of law rules. If those rules would send the issue back to the forum court, the forum court will accept the first remission and applies its own laws. Thus, equality of outcome is always achieved so long as the competing laws operate different systems. Some early French authorities support this approach (e.g. \"Forgo's Case\" (1882) and \"Souli√©'s Case\" (1910)). Similarly, Article 27 of the \"Introductory Law of the German Civil Code\" (1900) adopts it. But if both sets of laws operate with either no renvoi system or single renvoi systems, forum shopping will be a potential problem.\n\nHence, there is another system called \"Double Renvoi\" or the \"Foreign Courts Doctrine\" which will also ensure parity of result so long as no other relevant law is using it. In this scenario, the forum court considers that it is sitting as the foreign court and will decide the matter as the foreign court would. In this system, there can never be more than two remissions, e.g. English forum refers to French law (a single renvoi system) so English law is applied (1st remission) and France accepts the remission (2nd and final). At present, only English law uses this approach.\n\nBecause the doctrine is considered difficult and its results are sometimes unpredictable, its application has generally been limited to:\n\nHowever, there are indications in some states that it might also apply to two issues in family law, namely the capacity to marry and the formal validity of marriage.\n\nIn the European Union, application of renvoi is expressly excluded in contract cases under article 20 of the Rome I Regulation (regulation (EC) 593/2008l formerly in Article 15 EC Convention on the Law Applicable to Contractual Obligations, Rome 1980). It has also been rejected for contracts by most Commonwealth countries.\n\nMost states also exclude it in tort cases e.g. in the UK section 9(5) of the Private International Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1995. Since 11 January 2009, Regulation (EC) 864/2007 (the Rome II Regulation) on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations has been in force, controlling in a uniform way the rules throughout the European Union. Article 24 of this regulation provides:\" \"The application of the law of any country specified by this Regulation means the application of the rules of law in force in that country other than its rules of private international law.\"\" hence excluding the possibility of renvoi throughout the EU in tort cases.\n\nIn Australia, the doctrine of renvoi was revived by the decision of the High Court in \"Neilson v Overseas Projects Corporation of Victoria Ltd\" [2005] HCA 54 (29 September 2005). In this decision the High Court considered the situation of Mrs Neilson, who had injured herself falling down the stairs in her apartment in Wuhan, China. Her apartment had been provided by her husband's employer, Overseas Projects Corporation, and Mrs Neilson sued her husband's employer in negligence in the Supreme Court of Western Australia in June 1997, six years after the accident had occurred. Under Australian choice of law rules, the law of the place of the incident or \"lex loci delicti\" governs tort situations (following the decision of that court in 2002: \"Regie Nationale des Usines Renault SA v Zhang\"). This meant that the law relevant to the resolution of the dispute was that of the People's Republic of China. However under Chinese law, the claim would have been statute barred for exceeding the limitations period (Article 136 of the General Principles of Civil Law of the People's Republic of China). However Mrs Neilson raised Article 146 of the General Principles in her defence, arguing that the provision of that article should apply making the relevant law for the dispute Australian law. Article 146 provided that:\n\n\"With regard to compensation for damages resulting from an infringement of rights, the law of the place in which the infringement occurred shall be applied. If both parties are nationals of the same country or domiciled in the same country, the law of their own country or of their place of domicile may also be applied\"\n\nAs a consequence, the Supreme Court trial judge concluded that Art 146 \"gives me a right to choose to apply the law of Australia because both parties are nationals of Australia.\" This decision was reversed by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia.\n\nOn appeal to the High Court, Neilson succeeded. In six separate judgments, the majority of the High Court found in favour of Neilson on the basis that the Australian choice of law rule referred to the whole of the law of the place of the wrong. Secondly, that this meant that the applicable law was referred back to Australia and the Australian limitations statute applied, meaning that Neilson's claim was no longer statute barred.\n\nThis decision has received strident criticism by Martin Davies, and both the High Court and Full Court decisions have received very close attention by leading contemporary conflicts scholars including Andrew Lu and Lee Carroll, Elizabeth Crawford, and Mary Keyes.\n\nIt has been suggested that this messy interpretation of the Australian Court could have been avoided, had the Court followed the general practice that procedural rules always go with the forum and substantive law depends on the \"forum most interested\" analysis. However, since \"John Pfeiffer Pty Ltd v Rogerson\" (2000) 203 CLR 503, statutes of limitations are considered substantive law. Because of this, the applicability of limitation laws no longer go with the local forum; rather, they too follow the \"lex loci delicti\".\n\nIn the United States most courts try to solve conflict of laws questions without invoking renvoi. \"In Re Schneider's Estate\", 96 N.Y.S.2d 652 (1950), is an example where renvoi is recognized as an option, in which the local court chose to apply the foreign country's laws to decide the dispute in the local court. This is most likely to happen in cases involving immovable property or domestic relationships.\n\nThere are three main difficulties in cases where renvoi may be an issue:\n"}

{"id": "4994437", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4994437", "title": "Social Security Wage Base", "text": "Social Security Wage Base\n\nFor the Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance (OASDI) tax or Social Security tax in the United States, the Social Security Wage Base (SSWB) is the maximum earned gross income or upper threshold on which a wage earner's Social Security tax may be imposed. The Social Security tax is one component of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax (FICA) and Self-employment tax, the other component being the Medicare tax. It is also the maximum amount of covered wages that are taken into account when average earnings are calculated in order to determine a worker's Social Security benefit.\n\nIn 2018, the Social Security Wage Base was $128,400 and the Social Security tax rate was 6.20% paid by the employee and 6.20% paid by the employer. A person with $10,000 of gross income had $620.00 withheld as Social Security tax from his check and the employer sent an additional $620.00. A person with $130,000 of gross income in 2017 incurred Social Security tax of $7,886.40 (resulting in an effective rate of approximately 6.07% - the rate was lower because the income was more than the 2017 \"wage base\", see below), with $7,886.40 paid by the employer. A person who earned a million dollars in wages paid the same $7,886.40 in Social Security tax (resulting in an effective rate of approximately 0.79%), with equivalent employer matching. In the cases of the $130k and $1m earners, each paid the same amount into the social security system, and both will take the same out of the social security system.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office considers the employer share of taxes to be passed on to employees in the form of lower wages than would otherwise be paid, and counts them as part of the employees‚Äô tax burden. Self-employed individuals pay the entire amount of applicable tax.\n\nWhen an employee works for several different companies during a tax year, his or her Social Security deductions could exceed the cap, because each employer may not know how much the employee has already paid in Social Security tax in other jobs. The Social Security tax coverage will be calculated on his or her personal return, and any excess is applied towards his or her Federal taxes. For example, in 2017 an employee works two jobs (either concurrently or consecutively) paying $70,000 each. Since each employer calculates the social security taxes independently, each employer will withhold 6.2% of the $70,000 employee‚Äôs salary, or $4,340, for a grand total of $8,680 -- which exceeds the cap of $7,886.40 by $739.60. The over-payment would be entered on the applicable line of Form 1040 and, assuming the employee did not owe any other Federal taxes, would be refunded to the employee. The employers who each paid $4,340 will not get a refund, since they are not aware that the employee overpaid in aggregate for the year. The government keeps the $818.40 overage. Even if the employers become aware of the overpayment, there is no method to claim the overpayment.\n\nSeveral occupations are exempted from the current cap with a far lower cap, such as food service employees and domestic help employees. For the year 2014, the cap was $6,500 in wages.\n\nSince 2000, the SSWB has been:\n(*) The maximum employee share in 2011 is reduced to $4,485.60, but the maximum employer share remains at $6,621.60. The maximum employee share in 2012 is reduced to $4,624.20, but the maximum employer share remains at $6,826.20. Effectively, this was a 4.2% rate charged to the employee, and 6.2% rate to the employer. This resulted in an approximately 40/60 split but reduced the total contribution.\nSee here for a complete historical list of the Social Security Wage Base.\n\n(**) Since 1990, the employer & employee share has usually been 6.2% each for a 50/50 split of the 12.4% combined total. The changes shown below applied In 2011 and 2012 when the rates were temporarily lowered to 4.2% for the employee (but remained at 6.2% for the employer). In 2013, the employee rate returns to 6.2% for a 50/50 split with the employer and a higher Maximum Contribution. For self-employed people, the 2013 guidance from SSA indicates the full rate OASDI is 12.4% for 2013. See footnote a. at 2013 SSA.gov link. Returning to the traditional 6.2% OASDI employee share for 2013 effectively reduces take home pay by 2% and increases the maximum OASDI contribution by the same amount, returning it to traditional levels. The dip in the maximum OASDI contributions for 2011 and 2012 causes the 2013 rate to appear as a spike, when in fact it is a return to the levels imposed in the years 1990 through 2010.\n\nNote that although self-employed individuals pay 12.4%, this is mitigated two ways. First, half of the amount of the tax is reduced from salary before figuring the tax (you don't pay Social Security tax on the tax your employer pays for you.) Second, the \"employer\" half is an adjustment to income on the front page of Form 1040. \n\nAs part of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2008 enacted on December 17, 2010, the employee Social Security tax rate is reduced from 6.2% to 4.2% for wages paid during the year 2011 and 2012. The employer Social Security tax rate and the Social Security Wage Base were not directly impacted by this act, though they did change; only the employee's tax rate changes. This is reflected in the above table, showing the reduction from $6,621.60 to $4,485.60.\n\nBecause taxes and benefits are based only on earnings up to the SSWB, pension plans can base contributions and or benefits in greater degree on earnings above the SSWB (excess plans) or reduce benefits or contributions below the SSWB (offset plans).\n\nThe pension compensation nondiscrimination laws (Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(4)) require that qualified pension plans not discriminate in benefits, rights and features in favor of \"highly compensated employees\" (in 2007, the threshold is $100K of 2006 gross pay including bonuses and overtime). Because Social Security provides a progressive benefit formula and stops taxation at the SSWB, pension plans may \"integrate\" benefits or contributions according to a wage base, frequently at a fraction (e.g. 50%) of the SSWB.\n\nPlans can contribute a higher percentage to base salaries above an integration base. If that integration base is identical to the SSWB the contributions may be double above the base not to exceed 5.7% for excess plans. For offset plans the defined-contribution plan may base contributions on total base salary and then reduce or \"offset\" the contribution rate for salary below the integration base. If the integration base for such offset plans is identical to the SSWB, then the reduction could be up to 5.7%.\n\nFor defined benefit plans the integration base is a career average of the SSWB for each year of the worker's career, which in pension law is called \"covered compensation\" base. Under pension law, the SSWB may not be projected to increase in the future so a new hire's covered compensation base would contain all future years at the current year's SSWB. Excess and offset plans also exist for defined-benefit plans.\n\n"}

{"id": "8138183", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8138183", "title": "Taiwanese identity", "text": "Taiwanese identity\n\nThe definition of Taiwanese identity has been an ongoing issue for several decades arising from the political rivalry between Taiwan (ROC) and the People's Republic of China (PRC). Taiwanese are frustrated by the political rivalry which is the cause of confusion both inside and outside Taiwan.\n\nOf the 23 million people in Taiwan, most are descendants of immigrants from Fujian and identify themselves as Hoklo whilst 15% are descendants of Hakka from Guangdong (Canton) and also Fujian. Periodic migrations started before the 12th century. In addition to the Taiwanese aborigines, it is primarily the descendants of the early immigrants from the province of Fujian in China. The ancestors of these people were laborers that crossed the Taiwan Strait to work on plantations for the Dutch. It is believed that some of these male laborers married aborigine women, creating a new small ethnic group of mixed people. In 1683, the Qing Empire, which controlled China, conquered Taiwan. The Qing ceded Taiwan to the Japanese in 1895.\n\nJapan took control of Taiwan when China, then under the control of the Qing Dynasty since its conquest in 1683, lost the First Sino-Japanese War. The Japanese rule of Taiwan lasted from 1895 until 1945, when Japan was defeated by the allied forces at the end of World War II. Taiwanese perceptions of the Japanese are significantly more favorable than perceptions in other parts of East Asia, partly because during its 50 years (1895‚Äì1945) of Japanese rule Japan developed Taiwan's economy and raised the standard of living for most Taiwanese citizens, building up Taiwan as a supply base for the Japanese main islands. Later Taiwanese also adopted Japanese names and practice Shinto, while the schools instilled a sense of \"Japanese spirit\" in students. By the time of World War II began, many ethnic Taiwanese were proficient in both Japanese and Hokkien, while keeping their unique identity. Many Taiwanese were conscripted by the Japanese army to aid in their military campaigns against China. Many Taiwanese units, alongside the regular Japanese army, took part in some of the most noteworthy campaigns of that time against China, including the Nanking Massacre.\n\nTowards the last decade of the Japanese rule, the occupation force started a systematic campaign of to instill the to assimilate ethnic Taiwanese into imperial subjects of the Japanese empire. This process was stopped when Japan was defeated at the end of World War II, ending efforts on the part of the Japanese forces, to integrate Taiwan, as with Okinawa and Hokkaid≈ç, into the Japanese empire. During this last decade, Taiwanese were encouraged to adopt Japanese names. Many older generation Taiwanese have fond memories of the Japanese rule in comparison to the later KMT occupation.\n\nAfter the Republic of China relocated its capital to Taipei in 1949, Chiang Kai-shek intended to eventually return to Mainland China and retake control of it. In order to do this, the KMT attempted to \"sinicize\" the Taiwanese people. KMT's Taiwan Garrison Commander Chen Yi stated that after 50 years of Japanese rule, \"Taiwanese customs, thought, and language would have to gradually return to that of the Chinese people\". The KMT believed that a centrally controlled curriculum would forge a unified national sentiment in Taiwan. They also believed education would help build a martial spirit and stimulate enough military, economic, political, and cultural strength not only to survive, but also to recover the mainland. However, the Korean War in 1950, during which the PRC fought United States soldiers, changed this situation. It indeed pushed the US to conclude a mutual security treaty with the ROC since they did not want the Communists to take over the island. Thus protected by the US, the people on Taiwan continued developing their own identity, separate from mainland China.\n\nIn 1979, diplomatic relationships between the US and the ROC broke down, and more and more governments started to view the PRC as the sole government of China. Thus, the ROC's political focus gradually shifted its attention from mainland China to the island of Taiwan, and many citizens started to consider themselves as part of a nation, separate from mainland China. The first transition of power from the KMT occurred in 2000 when Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party won the presidential election. His efforts favoring Taiwan independence included advocacy of One Country on Each Side; referendums on Cross-Strait relations, transitional justice, and United Nations membership for Taiwan; along with the abolishment of the National Unification Council. In recent years, there has been a trend, known as Taiwanization, to emphasize the importance of Taiwan's culture rather than to regard Taiwanese as solely an appendage of China. The movement stems from the continued hostility displayed by the People's Republic of China towards Taiwan independence and the memory of the Chinese-controlled Kuomintang occupation. This involves the teaching of history of Taiwan, geography, and culture from a Taiwan-centric perspective, as well as promoting languages locally established in Taiwan, including Taiwanese, Hakka and aboriginal languages.\n\nThe place of Taiwanese identity (Âè∞ÁÅ£‰∫∫) in relation to the Chinese identity (ËèØ‰∫∫) has been a matter of intense debate. While pro-unification Taiwanese (Êµ∑Â§ñËèØ‰∫∫) prefer to think of the Taiwanese identity as a subset of the Chinese national identity, and instead describe the Taiwanese identity as a component of the Chinese diaspora (Êµ∑Â§ñËèØ‰∫∫ or ËèØË£î), pro-independence Taiwanese place the Taiwanese identity outside the Chinese national identity, and instead describe the Taiwanese identity as (Êµ∑Â§ñÂè∞ÁÅ£‰∫∫ or Âè∞Ë£î).\n\nWhile the concept of Taiwanese identity was originally limited of the Taiwan independence movement, it is now endorsed by some supporters of Cross-Strait unification on Taiwan in a rejection of a monolithic officially sponsored Han Chinese identity in favor of one rooted in a unique, Taiwan-centric culture.\n\nA new term, known as \"Republic of China People\" (‰∏≠ËèØÊ∞ëÂúã‰∫∫Ôºâis used to resolve the national identity crisis (pertaining to the diverse ethnic groups living in Taiwan, as well as Penghu, Kinmen and other minor islands, as well as overseas Taiwanese/Chinese who are still holding the Republic of China citizenship). It appeared particularly during the 2011 celebration of the 100th Anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China.\n\nPolls conducted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) in 2001 found that 70% of Taiwanese would support a name change of the country to Taiwan if the island could no longer be referred to as the Republic of China.\n\nIn recent years, especially after the 1990s, there has been a growth in the number of people identifying themselves as Taiwanese. In polls conducted by the National Chengchi University back in 1991, only 13.6% of respondents identified themselves as Taiwanese. This figure rose to 45.7% in 2004. In contrast, the number of respondents that identified themselves as Chinese was 43.9% in 1991 and fell to just 6.3% in 2004. Half of respondents responded with dual-identity, both Chinese and Taiwanese, and the statistic has remained steady with just a slight decline from 49.7% in 1992 to 45.4% in 2004.\n\nThe Academia Sinica conducted a survey between 1992 and 2004 to further explore the identity issue by asking questions such as whether people would support independence if it wouldn't result in war, and whether Taiwan should unite with China if there were no political, economic or social differences between the two sides. Results showed that a third of respondents maintained \"double-identities\" over the years whilst a similar number of respondents were \"Taiwanese nationalists\" (those that would never support unification with China even if there were no differences with China). This number doubled as a result of provocation from the PRC in the 1996 missile crisis. There has been a sharp decline in \"Chinese nationalist\" (those that would support unification with China if the social conditions were the same as Taiwan) from 40% to 15%. The opinion of Taiwanese continues to change, reflecting the problem of national identity which is easily affected by political, social and economic circumstances.\n\nIn a poll dated June 2009, 52.1% of Taiwan's population consider themselves to be only Taiwanese while 39.2% consider themselves to be both Taiwanese and Chinese and only 4.4% consider themselves to be Chinese only..\n\nIn a poll dated 2016 about 78% see themselves as Taiwanese only, 20% as both and only 2% see themselves as Chinese only.\n\nDuring the period of Martial Law, when the Kuomintang (KMT) was the only authorised party to govern Taiwan, the KMT government has \"modified\" Taiwan's history from a Greater China perspective and lump the pre-existing Hoklo and Hakka with the Mainlanders as \"Chinese\", who came to Taiwan and forced aboriginal communities into the mountains. The early Hoklo and Hakka who arrived in Taiwan have intermarried with lowland aborigines in Taiwan. Also, due to several government factions that ruled Taiwan prior to Japanese rule, many lowland aborigines were forcefully assimilated, and it was in their incentives to \"pass\" as Hoklo.\n\nWithin the Taiwanese Han Hoklo community itself, differences in culture indicate the degree to which mixture with aboriginals took place, with most pure Hoklo Han in Northern Taiwan having almost no Aboriginal admixture, which is limited to Hoklo Han in Southern Taiwan. Plains aboriginals who were mixed and assimilated into the Hoklo Han population at different stages were differentiated by the historian Melissa J. Brown between \"short-route\" and \"long-route\". The ethnic identity of assimilated Plains Aboriginals in the immediate vicinity of Tainan was still known since a pure Hoklo Taiwanese girl was warned by her mother to stay away from them. The insulting name \"fan\" was used against Plains Aborigines by the Taiwanese, and the Hoklo Taiwanese speech was forced upon Aborigines like the Pazeh. Hoklo Taiwanese has repalced Pazeh and driven it to near extinction. Aboriginal status has been requested by Plains Aboriginals.\n\nThe deep-rooted hostility between Taiwanese aborigines and (Taiwanese) Hoklo, and the Aboriginal communities' effective KMT networks contribute to Aboriginal skepticism against the DPP and the Aboriginals tendency to vote for the KMT. But since 2016, Aboriginals started to vote for the DPP instead of the KMT.\n\nSupporters of Taiwan Independence recognize themselves to be Taiwanese only and reject the designation \"Zhongguoren ‰∏≠Âúã‰∫∫\" (Chinese national or Chinese). In particular, they have emphasized that, politically and legally, they are not Chinese. A portion of Taiwanese feel that the country's official name Republic of China has legally imposed upon them the identity of Chinese national, and therefore are discontent to a certain degree, thus wishing to seek Taiwan Independence. However, the majority of the supporters of Taiwan Independence do not deny themselves as \"huaren ËèØ‰∫∫\" (ethnic Chinese) or \"huayi ËèØË£î\" (person of Chinese descent), meaning that they seek more of a political and legal separation from the Chinese national identity, rather than one based on a cultural or ancestral separation. This forms part of the Taiwanese nationalism ideology.\n\nBefore the 1990s, more than half of Taiwanese population recognized themselves as \"Zhongguoren ‰∏≠Âúã‰∫∫' (Chinese national or Chinese) or \"both Taiwanese and Chinese\". However, with the increasing exchange of information between mainland China and Taiwan, particularly with the rise of the Chinese internet, which has inclined more in favor of the People's Republic of China, the Taiwanese have strengthened the Taiwan localization movement as a response and rejection of the unification propaganda war from the People's Republic of China. Thus, by 2008, the proportion identifying themselves as Chinese has dropped while the proportion identifying as \"Taiwanese but not Chinese\" has increased.\n\nSince the term \"China\" has become identified with the People's Republic of China, Taiwanese who hate Chinese nationalism do not recognize themselves as Chinese nationals. The negative image of the Fenqing (angry youth) from the People's Republic of China on the internet who have pursued aggressive Chinese nationalism, and their threats to freedom, human rights, and democracy in Taiwan are the main reasons many Taiwanese do not identify themselves as Chinese nationals or Chinese. In response, Taiwanese Fenqing or angry youth have resorted to pursuing aggressive Taiwanese nationalism in retaliation against the Fenqing from the PRC on the internet.\n\nIn a 2009 \"Global Views Monthly\"(ÈÅ†Ë¶ãÈõúË™å) poll, Taiwanese who recognized themselves as \"Chinese national\" (Zhongguoren ‰∏≠Âúã‰∫∫) constitute 46%, \"Huaren ËèØ‰∫∫\" (ethnic Chinese) or \"Zhonghua minzu\" (‰∏≠ËèØÊ∞ëÊóè; Chinese race) constitute 70%. In a poll conducted by TVBS in 2008, given the choice of only one between the two identities (and not both), \"Taiwanese\" or \"Chinese\", 68% chose Taiwanese, while only 18% chose Chinese.\n\nMany Taiwanese wish to change the state's official name from Republic of China to Republic of Taiwan, in order to separate the identity and conceptual link between the two sides of the strait. However, this viewpoint has been strongly opposed by supporters of Chinese nationalism from the Pan-Blue Coalition.\n\n"}
{"id": "297678", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=297678", "title": "Tanistry", "text": "Tanistry\n\nTanistry is a Gaelic system for passing on titles and lands. In this system the Tanist (; ; ) is the office of heir-apparent, or second-in-command, among the (royal) Gaelic patrilineal dynasties of Ireland, Scotland and Mann, to succeed to the chieftainship or to the kingship.\n\nHistorically the Tanist was chosen from among the heads of the \"roydammna\" or \"righdamhna\" (literally, those of \"kingly material\") or, alternatively, among all males of the \"sept\", and elected by them in full assembly. The eligibility was based on patrilineal relationship, which meant the electing body and the eligibles were agnates with each other. The composition and the governance of the clan were built upon male-line descent from a similar ancestor. The office was noted from the beginning of recorded history in Ireland, and probably pre-dates it. A story about Cormac mac Airt refers to his eldest son as his Tanist. Following his murder by a member of the Deisi, another \"roydammna\", Eochaid Gonnat, succeeded as king.\n\nIn Ireland, the tanistry continued among the dominant dynasties, as well as lesser lords and chieftains, until the mid-16th/early 17th century when it was replaced by English common law. When in 1943 Ireland appointed its first new Chief Herald, it did not reintroduce tanistry. The state granted courtesy recognition to Irish chiefs based on primogeniture from the last known chief.\n\nThe Gaels exported tanistry and other customs to those parts of Scotland which they controlled after 400 CE. The Picts (the other indigenous people of today's Scotland), did not share the succession principles of their neighbours of Ireland and Scottish Gaels. No female succession, or male succession via female lines, is allowed in the Irish and Gaelic succession model. By contrast, Pictish succession often used links through females (maternal grandson was apparently preferred heir to grandfather; and/or maternal nephew to uncle in Pictish custom).\n\nThe royal succession in Celtic Scotland was limited to the elective agnatic or male line of the \"Siol Alpein\" (House of Alpin) until the accession of King Malcolm II in 1005. This monarch was the first to introduce the concept of hereditary monarchy in Scotland. He did so to try to eliminate the strife caused by the elective law, which encouraged rival claimants to fight for the Throne. Since Malcolm had only daughters, he also introduced the right of female-line succession in Scotland. This gave rise to conflict by competitors for generations thereafter. The Irish monarchies never at any stage allowed for female line succession, a position which is maintained to the present day.\n\nThe Tanist held office for life and was required by custom to be of full age, in possession of all his faculties and without any remarkable blemish of mind or body. At the same time, and subject to the same conditions, a tanist or next heir to the Monarchy was elected, who if the king died or became disqualified, at once became king. Most usually a former king's son became tanist (sometimes the son of the king simultaneously elected, however perhaps more often a son of a rival branch of the dynasty), but not because the system of primogeniture was in any way recognised; indeed, the only principle adopted was that the dignity of chieftainship should descend to the eldest and most worthy of the same male-line blood of the clan.\nThe usual rules for qualification as a \"roydammna\" was that a candidate had to be a member of the \"\"Derbfhine\"\", a kindred all descended in the male line from a common ancestor (usually a great-grandfather). This is recalled in the coats of arms of representatives of the many clans and septs descended from the U√≠ N√©ill royal dynasty, many of which feature the Red Hand. The joints in the fingers, the fingernails, and the hand, represented the four/five generations that qualified for inclusion within the \"Derbfhine\". This meant that the group became highly exclusive, keeping the kingship within the dynasty. Many in the wider clan might be reduced to gentry or peasant status (though they might share the surname). These features make tanistry an agnatic succession mode, and a succession by appointment, as it was an elective monarchy. Tanistry evades the basic requirement of the hereditary monarchy, i.e. that the outcome of the succession is predictable, up to the identity of successor and next heirs, by genealogy.\n\nThe downside of the large group of eligibles was that increases in \"roydammna\" in each generation might lead to internecine dynastic civil war. Such was the case among the descendants of King and High King Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair (1088‚Äì1156). His dynasty, the \"Sil Muirdeag\" (who took the surname hUa Conchobhair/O'Connor), had successfully ruled as Kings of Connacht since at least the mid-5th century. Their increasing consolidation via the annexation of the Kingdoms of Mide and Dublin, plus suborning neighboring states and lordships to vassalage, led to Tairrdelbach becoming the first of his dynasty to become High King.\n\nCompetition between Tairrdelbach's many sons caused corrosive warfare among at least four competing main lines, in addition to allied lordships' and kingdoms' striving for the main chance. Coupled with the incursions of the Normans from 1169 onwards, this fragmented √ì Conchobhar rule. By the early 16th century, they were reduced to ruling a fraction of their former patrimony.\n\nAnother example of \"Derbfhine\" or \"Roydammna\" proliferation comes from the \"Annals of Connacht\". It states that at the Second Battle of Athenry in August 1316, in addition to King Tadc √ì Cellaig of U√≠ Maine, \"there fell with him ... twenty-eight men who were entitled to succeed to the kingship of U√≠ Maine.\"\n\nThis system often led to rotation among the most prominent branches of the clan or the reigning house, particularly in the Middle Ages. Tanistry, though not necessarily intended to be so, was perceived to create balance between branches of family. A quite usual pattern was that the chief (king, lord) was succeeded by his Tanist, elected earlier and from another branch than that which the incumbent chief belonged to. Perhaps simultaneously upon that succession, a Tanist was elected from another branch, to fill the position vacated by the one now risen to chieftainship. He may have come from the branch to which the deceased belonged. The next vacancy would be handled in a similar way. If a chieftain attempted to have his own son (or brother) chosen over a representative of another branch, the electors were outraged, as they feared subjugation to one branch.\n\nIn 1296, the Bruce candidate to inherit the crown of Scotland pleaded the traditional tanistry in his favor. In terms of primogeniture, he was from a cadet branch of the old royal descent, and thus would not have succeeded. The idea of rotation and balance (and his seniority in physical age and experience) made him a credible competitor. A Pictish aspect was that both the House of Balliol and Bruce descended through female lines from the royal house, and were allowed to present candidacy. Bruce also claimed tanistry through a female line. (This may be an indication that in Scotland, Pictish and Gaelic succession rules were intermingled. The judicial resolution of the succession quarrel, directed by the English king, favoured the Balliols on the basis of primogeniture. Subsequent political events reverted that result to a more \"clannish-tradition\" direction. Robert the Bruce, grandson of the candidate who argued for tanistry, ascended the throne despite descending from a rather junior cadet line of the original Royal House. All future monarchs of Scotland after that succeeded by the rights of the Bruce.)\n\nTanistry as the system of succession left the headship open to the ambitious. It was a frequent source of strife both in families and between the clans, but it was conversely quasi-democratic. Tanistry was abolished by a legal decision during the reign of James VI of Scotland, who later was named James I of England and Ireland. The English land law was substituted.\n\nThe rules of succession of the House of Alpin of Scottish monarchs (a dynasty legendarily of mixed Pictish and Gaelic origin) and their successors, abided by tanistry rules until at least 1034. They also used them in certain successions in the 1090s, and tanistry was used as an argument in succession litigation as late as the 1290s. A similar system operated in Wales, where under Welsh law any of the sons or brothers of the king could be chosen as the \"edling\" or heir to the kingdom.\n\nThe word is preserved in the government of the Republic of Ireland, where the prime minister is the \"Taoiseach\" while the deputy prime minister is the \"T√°naiste\".\n\n\nBlood tanistry is the principle that \"the most talented male member of the royal dynasty should inherit the throne, commonly by murder and war\". It is also used to describe the practical ramifications of the Turco-Mongol, as well as other Central Asian steppe nomad, principles of inheritance and succession. Because all male members of the royal clan are considered to have equally legitimate claims on power, the ruler is the individual who eliminates competitors and re-subjugates the rest of the state formation. The structure may be determined by bonds of personal loyalty to the ruler, which are considered to be dissolved on the ruler's death.\n\n\n"}

It is contrasted to unicameralism and bicameralism, which are far more common, and tricameralism, which is rarely used in government. No state currently has a tetracameral system.\n\nMedieval Scandinavian deliberative assemblies were traditionally tetracameral, with four estates; the nobility, the clergy, the burghers and the peasants. The Swedish and Finnish Riksdag of the Estates maintained this tradition the longest, having four separate legislative bodies. Finland, as a part of Imperial Russia used the tetracameral Diet of Finland until 1906, when it was replaced by the unicameral Parliament.\n"}
{"id": "208784", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=208784", "title": "Thirty-year rule", "text": "Thirty-year rule\n\nThe \"thirty-year rule\" is the informal name given to laws in the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, and the Commonwealth of Australia that provide that certain government documents will be released publicly thirty years after they were created. Other countries' national archives also adhere to a thirty-year rule for the release of government documents.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Public Records Act 1958 stated that \"Public records...other than those to which members of the public have had access before their transfer...shall not be available for public inspection until they have been in existence for fifty years or such other period...as the Lord Chancellor may...for the time being prescribe as respects any particular class of public records\"; the closure period was reduced from fifty to thirty years by an amending act of 1967, passed during Harold Wilson's government. Among those who had repeatedly urged the scrapping of the fifty-year rule was the historian A. J. P. Taylor.\n\nThere were two elements to the rule: the first required that records be transferred from government departments to the Public Record Office (now The National Archives) after thirty years unless specific exemptions were given (by the Lord Chancellor's Advisory Council on Public Records); the second that they would be opened to public access at the same time unless their release was deemed likely to cause \"damage to the country's image, national security or foreign relations\".\n\nSignificant changes were made to the rules as a consequence of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA) (which came into full effect on 1 January 2005). FOIA essentially removed the second of the thirty-year rules (the access one), and replaced it with provisions allowing citizens to request a wide range of information before any time limit has expired; and also removed some of the exemptions which had previously applied at the thirty-year point. After thirty years, records are transferred to The National Archives, and are reviewed under FOIA to see if they should be opened. The only rationale for keeping them closed within The National Archives is if a FOIA exemption applies.\n\nAs a result of this change, releases now happen monthly, rather than annually, and include more recent events, rather than only those over thirty years old.\n\nAn independent inquiry chaired by Paul Dacre, editor of the \"Daily Mail\", recommended in January 2009 that the last restrictions on the release of information, such as Cabinet minutes, should be reduced to a fifteen-year embargo and phased in over a 15-year period.\n\nUnder the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010, the UK Government started moving towards a twenty-year rule. Files from 1983 were released in August 2013 rather than January 2014 as would previously have been the case, and files from 1984 in January 2014. There will continue to be two releases per year until 2022 when the National Archives will receive the files from 2001 and 2002, having caught up with the transition.\n\nIn Australia, the thirty-year rule applied to Commonwealth (federal) government records, except for Cabinet handbooks (closed for fifty years) and raw census records (closed for 99 years). These periods were set out in the \"Archives Act 1983\".\n\nIn 2009, the Archives Act was amended to reduce the closed period from thirty to twenty years, with Cabinet notebooks reduced from fifty to thirty years. Census records remain closed for 99 years to protect the privacy of individuals.\n\nCabinet papers for a full year are released on 1 January each year. From 2011, two years of cabinet papers and three years of cabinet notebooks are released together until 2020 when the new periods are reached.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada has recognized that Cabinet confidentiality is essential to good government. In the decision \"Babcock v AG Canada\" the Court explained the reason as:\n\nTo preserve this rule of confidentiality, subsection 70(1) of the Privacy Act provides that the Act does not apply to confidences of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada. Other notable cases that expand upon the doctrine of cabinet confidentiality include \"Canada (Minister of Environment) v. Canada (Information Commissioner), 2003 FCA 68\" and \"Quinn v. Canada (Prime Minister), 2011 FC 379\". As of 2013, after a time lag of 20 years Canadians can submit access-to-information requests for cabinet records through the Privy Council Office, but this comes at a cost of $5 per request and can take months to process. In May 2018, it was disclosed that the Supreme Court of Canada under Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin had placed a \"50-year from the time they rule on a case\" embargo on public access to files related to the deliberations of the judges.\n\nAccording to Archivist Michael Dufresne, it was not until 1940 and the advent of the Second World War that Cabinet kept an agenda and minutes of its deliberations. From 1867 to 1940, a succession of six men served as Clerk of the Privy Council, and their duties included serving as the only institutional memory bank of the Government of Canada. The appointment in 1940 of Arnold Danforth Patrick Heeney as Clerk and as first Secretary to the Cabinet changed the format of memory bank from biological to scriptural. Heeney was surprised upon arrival by the informal ways in which important business was conducted:\nOrder-in-Council PC 1940-1121 of March 25, 1940 ushered in a significant change in the documentation of government. The Order-in-Council read, in part:\nHeeney established procedures and for the first time recorded the minutes and conclusions of a cabinet body - the Cabinet War Committee. In 1942, the Statutory Orders and Regulations Division was set up under PC 7992, 4 September 1942. Also under PC 7992, a registry for maintaining orders and minutes of council, Treasury Board Minutes and other government orders was established. It was not until 1944 that the formal collection of \"Cabinet Conclusions\" was created.\n\nIn the early 1980s, the PCO began a voluntary transfer of cabinet records, which had been declassified after a 30-year holding period, to the National Archives (which became Library and Archives Canada in 2004) where they became publicly available, under the label \"Cabinet Conclusions\". After an initial document dump that included records dated from 1937 to 1952, the PCO released the records on an annual basis.\n\nIn 2008, two years after Prime Minister Stephen Harper was elected, the tradition of annual voluntary releases of Cabinet Conclusions stopped.\n\nIn September 2013 while the Harper government was in power, PCO spokesman Raymond Rivet told a news organisation that the office was ‚Äúcommitted‚Äù to making government documents and information accessible but that ‚ÄúProcessing these records requires a significant investment of resources. We will continue to process and release records as resources permit.‚Äù\n\nIn May 2017, it came to light that the Government of Canada was under no obligation to release documentary records after a number of years. NDP MP Murray Rankin, a legal scholar, said at the time:\n\nIsrael adopted the British model of a thirty-year rule as the basis for reviewing and declassifying its foreign policy documents. Israeli declassification policy is based on the Archives law of 1955. The principle of the law is that all material is to be released after thirty years, subject to limitations based on damage to state security, foreign policy or personal privacy. In practice this means that declassification of documents are fixed at different periods based on type of material and date of production.\n\nThe original law has been modified and updated a number of times. Following a 2010 update of the legislation, the office of the Prime Minister released as statement explaining that \"the new regulations shorten the period after which non-security-related material may be viewed, from 30 to 15 years, while lengthening the confidentiality period of certain defense-related documents to 70 years in cases in which Israel's security conditions require it\".\n\nThe German Federal Archives generally makes its holdings available after 30 years. Exceptions are for personnel files, which are opened only 10 years after the death of the individual or 100 years after the person's birth if the date of death is unknown, and records dealing with taxation, credit, and banking, which are sealed for 60 years. \n\nAdditionally, Federal Archives holdings originating with the Communist Party and communist organizations of the former German Democratic Republic (East Germany) have been available for decades with almost no limitations. The Federal Archives has also worked to make East German government records available with a minimum of time limitation. In any event, in October 2020, 30 years will have passed since the dissolution of the GDR.\n\n\n"}

For example, someone could use blackmail to induce a contractor into breaking a contract or they could obstruct someone's ability to honor a contract with a client by deliberately refusing to deliver necessary goods.\n\nA tort of negligent interference occurs when one party's negligence damages the contractual or business relationship between others, causing economic harm, such as, by blocking a waterway or causing a blackout that prevents the utility company from being able to uphold its existing contracts with consumers.\n\nTortious interference with contract rights can occur when one party convinces another to breach its contract with a third party (e.g., using blackmail, threats, influence, etc.) or where someone knowingly interferes with a contractor's ability to perform his contractual obligations, preventing the client from receiving the services or goods promised (e.g., by refusing to deliver goods). The tortfeasor is the person who interferes with the contractual relationship between others. When a tortfeasor is aware of an existing contract and deliberately induces a breach by one of the contract holders, it is termed, \"tortious inducement of breach of contract\".\n\nTortious interference with business relationships occurs where the tortfeasor intentionally acts to prevent someone from successfully establishing or maintaining business relationships with others. This tort may occur when one party knowingly takes an action that causes a second party not to enter into a business relationship with a third party that otherwise would probably have occurred. An example is when a tortfeasor offers to sell a property to someone below market value knowing they were in the final stages of a sale with a third party pending the upcoming settlement date to formalize the sale writing. Such conduct is termed \"tortious interference with a business expectancy\".\n\nThe above situation are actionable only if someone with actual knowledge of, and intent to interfere with, an existing contract or expectancy between other parties, acts improperly with malicious intent and actually interferes with the contract/expectancy, causing economic harm. Historically, there has not been actionable cause if the interference was merely . However, for some jurisdictions recognize such claims, although many do not. A tort of negligent interference occurs when one party's negligence damages the contractual or business relationship between others causing economic harm, such as, by blocking a waterway or causing a blackout preventing the utility company from being able to uphold its existing contracts with consumers.\n\nAn early, perhaps the earliest, instance of recognition of this tort occurred in \"Garret v Taylor\", 79 Eng. Rep. 485 (K.B. 1620). In that case, the defendant drove customers away from the plaintiff‚Äôs quarry by threatening them with mayhem and also threatening to ‚Äúvex [them] with suits.‚Äù The King's Bench court said that ‚Äúthe defendant threatened violence to the extent of committing an assault upon ... customers of the plaintiff ... whereupon ‚Äòthey all desisted from buying.‚Äô‚Äô The court therefore upheld a judgment for the plaintiff.\n\nIn a similar case, \"Tarleton v McGawley\", 170 Eng. Rep. 153 (K.B. 1793), the defendant shot from its ship Othello off the coast of Africa upon natives while ‚Äúcontriving and maliciously intending to hinder and deter the natives from trading with‚Äù plaintiff‚Äôs rival trading ship Bannister. This action caused the natives (plaintiff‚Äôs prospective customers) to flee the scene, depriving the plaintiff of their potential business. The King's Bench court held the conduct actionable. The defendant claimed, by way of justification, that the local native ruler had given it an exclusive franchise to trade with his subjects, but the court rejected this defense.\n\nThe tort was described in the case of \"Keeble v Hickeringill\", (1707) 103 Eng. Rep. 1127, styled as a \"trespass on the case\". In that case, the defendant had used a shotgun to drive ducks away from a pond that the plaintiff had built for the purpose of capturing ducks. Thus, unlike the foregoing cases, here the actionable conduct was not directly driving the prospective customers away, but rather eliminating the subject matter of the prospective business. Although the ducks had not yet been captured, the Justice Holt wrote for the court that \"where a violent or malicious act is done to a man's occupation, profession, or way of getting a livelihood, there an action lies in all cases.\" The court noted that the defendant would have the right to draw away ducks to a pond of his own, raising as a comparison a 1410 case in which the court deemed that no cause of action would lie where a schoolmaster opened a new school that drew students away from an old school.\n\nThe application of the above has since been modified in UK law. In OBG v Allan \"et al.\" 2008 1AC 1\n\nWrongful interference: the unified theory which treated causing loss by unlawful means as an extension of the tort of inducing a breach of contract was abandoned; inducing breach of contract and causing loss by unlawful means were two separate torts.\ninducing a breach of contract was a tort of accessory liability, and an intention to cause a breach of contract was a necessary and sufficient requirement for liability; a person had to know that he was inducing a breach of contract and to intend to do; that a conscious decision not to inquire into the existence of a fact could be treated as knowledge for the purposes of the tort; that a person who knowingly induced a breach of contract as a means to an end had the necessary intent even if he was not motivated by malice but had acted with the motive of securing an economic advantage for himself; that, however, a breach of contract which was neither an end in itself nor a means to an end but was merely a foreseeable consequence of a person‚Äôs acts did not give rise to liability; and that there could be no secondary liability without primary liability, and therefore a person could not be liable for inducing a breach of contract unless there had in fact been a breach by the contracting party.\n\nCausing loss by unlawful means: acts against a third party counted as unlawful means only if they were actionable by that third party if he had suffered loss; that unlawful means consisted of acts intended to cause loss to the claimant by interfering with the freedom of a third party in a way which was unlawful as against that third party and which was intended to cause loss to the claimant, but did not include acts which might be unlawful against a third party but which did not affect his freedom to deal with the claimant. Strict liability for conversion applied only to an interest in chattels and not to chooses in action; this was too radical to impose liability for pure economic loss on receivers who had been appointed and had acted in good faith. This also left open the position where they breached the duty of good faith.\n\n\nAlthough the specific elements required to prove a claim of tortious interference vary from one jurisdiction to another, they typically include the following:\n\n\nThe first element may, in employment-at-will jurisdictions, be held fulfilled in regards to a previously unterminated employer/employee relationship.\n\nIn California, these are the elements of negligent interference with prospective economic advantage, which the plaintiff must establish:\n\n\nSome cases add that a defendant acts negligently only if \"the defendant owes the plaintiff a duty of care.\"\n\nCalifornia and most jurisdictions hold that there is a privilege to compete for business. ‚ÄúUnder the privilege of free competition, a competitor is free to divert business to himself as long as he uses fair and reasonable means. Thus, the plaintiff must present facts indicating the defendant‚Äôs interference is somehow wrongful‚Äîi.e., based on facts that take the defendant‚Äôs actions out of the realm of legitimate business transactions.‚Äù \"[T]he competition privilege is defeated only where the defendant engages in unlawful or illegitimate means.\" \"\n\"Wrongful\" in this context means ‚Äúindependently wrongful‚Äù‚Äîthat is, \"blameworthy\" or \" independently wrongful apart from the interference itself.\" This may be termed use of improper means. ‚ÄúCommonly included among improper means are actions which are independently actionable, violations of federal or state law or unethical business practices, e.g., violence, misrepresentation, unfounded litigation, defamation, trade libel or trade mark infringement.‚Äù Other examples of \"wrongful conduct\" are \"fraud, misrepresentation, intimidation, coercion, obstruction or molestation of the rival or his servants or workmen.\"\n\nTypical legal damages for tortious interference include economic losses, if they can be proven with certainty, and mental distress. Additionally punitive damages may be awarded if malice on the part of the wrongdoer can be established.\n\nEquitable remedies may include injunctive relief in the form of a negative injunction that would be used to prevent the wrongdoer from benefiting from any contractual relationship that may arise out of the interference, i.e., the performance of a singer who was originally contracted with the plaintiff to perform at the same time.\n\nTortious interference with an expected inheritance - One who, by fraud, duress or other tortious means intentionally prevents another from receiving from a third person an inheritance or gift that he would otherwise have received, is subject to liability to the other for loss of the inheritance or gift.\n\n\n"}

It was only shortly advertised with limited details. The reserve price was fixed without the guidance of a qualified valuer at $1.2m. There was only one bid. It was Mrs Wong. She was acting on behalf of the company owned by Mr Wong and his family. They had apparently had a board meeting before resolving that they would bid up to a maximum of $1.2m.\n\nThe trial Judge found that $1.2m was not a proper price, but refused to set the sale aside because of the borrower‚Äôs delay in pursuing the counterclaim. He awarded damages instead. The Court of Appeal set aside the judge‚Äôs award.\n\nThe Privy Council restored the judge‚Äôs award, holding that although the sale could not be set aside, given that too long was taken, damages could be awarded. There was a clear conflict of interest here, importing a necessity to show that reasonable precautions had been taken to get the best price. The Board advised that although the respondent was free to sell to a company in which he was interested, he had failed to demonstrate he had taken reasonable care in the conduct of the sale. An auction was not necessarily the most appropriate mode of sale. Expert advice should have been sought for valuing and the sale mode. Lord Templeman said:\n\n"}

A webcast may either be distributed live or on demand. Essentially, webcasting is \"broadcasting\" over the Internet.\n\nThe largest \"webcasters\" include existing radio and TV stations, who \"simulcast\" their output through online TV or online radio streaming, as well as a multitude of Internet only \"stations\". Webcasting usually consists of providing non-interactive linear streams or events. Rights and licensing bodies offer specific \"webcasting licenses\" to those wishing to carry out Internet broadcasting using copyrighted material.\n\nWebcasting is used extensively in the commercial sector for investor relations presentations (such as annual general meetings), in e-learning (to transmit seminars), and for related communications activities. However, webcasting does not bear much, if any, relationship to web conferencing, which is designed for many-to-many interaction.\n\nThe ability to webcast using cheap/accessible technology has allowed independent media to flourish. There are many notable independent shows that broadcast regularly online. Often produced by average citizens in their homes they cover many interests and topics. Webcasts relating to computers, technology, and news are particularly popular and many new shows are added regularly.\n\nWebcasting differs from podcasting in that webcasting refers to live streaming while podcasting simply refers to media files placed on the Internet.\n\nWebcasting is the distribution of media files through the internet.\n\nThe earliest graphically-oriented web broadcasts were not streaming video, but were in fact still frames which were photographed with a web camera every few minutes while they were being broadcast live over the Internet. One of the earliest instances of sequential live image broadcasting was in 1991 when a camera was set up next to the Trojan Room in the computer laboratory of the University of Cambridge. It provided a live picture every few minutes of the office coffee pot to all desktop computers on that office's network. A couple of years later its broadcasts went to the Internet, became known as the Trojan Room Coffee Pot webcam, and gained international notoriety as a feature of the fledgling World Wide Web. \n\nLater in 1996 an American college student and conceptual artist, Jenny Ringley, set up a web camera similar to the Trojan Room Coffee Pot's webcam in her dorm room. That webcam photographed her every few minutes while it broadcast those images live over the Internet upon a site called \"JenniCam\". Ringley wanted to portray all aspects of her lifestyle and the camera captured her doing almost everything¬†‚Äì brushing her teeth, doing her laundry, and even having sex with her boyfriend. Her website generated millions of hits upon the Internet, became a pay site in 1998, and spawned hundreds of female imitators who would then use streaming video to create a new billion dollar industry called \"camming\", and brand themselves as camgirls or webcam models.\n\nOne of the earliest webcast equivalent of an online concert and one of the earliest examples of webcasting itself was by Apple Computer's Webcasting Group in partnership with the entrepreneurs Michael Dorf and Andrew Rasiej. Together with David B. Pakman from Apple, they launched the Macintosh New York Music Festival from July 17‚Äì22, 1995. This event audio webcast concerts from more than 15 clubs in New York City. Apple later webcast a concert by Metallica on June 10, 1996 live from Slim's in San Francisco.\n\nIn 1995, Benford E. Standley produced one of the first audio/video webcasts in history.\n\nOn October 31, 1996, UK rock band Caduseus broadcast their one-hour concert from 11pm to 12midnight (UT) at Celtica in Machynlleth, Wales, UK¬†‚Äì the first live streamed audio and simultaneous live streamed video multicast¬†‚Äì around the globe to more than twenty direct \"mirrors\" in more than twenty countries.\n\nIn September 1997, Nebraska Public Television started webcasting Big Red Wrap Up from Lincoln, Nebraska which combined highlights from every Cornhusker football game, coverage of the coaches' weekly press conferences, analysis with Nebraska sportswriters, appearances by special guests and questions and answers with viewers.\n\nOn August 13, 1998, it is generally believed the first webcast wedding took place, between Alan K'necht and Carrie Silverman in Toronto Canada.\n\nOn October 22, 1998, the first Billy Graham Crusade was broadcast live to a worldwide audience from the Raymond James Stadium in Tampa Florida courtesy of Dale Ficken and the WebcastCenter in Pennsylvania. The live signal was broadcast via satellite to PA, then encoded and streamed via the BGEA website.\n\nThe first teleconferenced/webcast wedding to date is believed to have occurred on December 31, 1998. Dale Ficken and Lorrie Scarangella wed on this date as they stood in a church in Pennsylvania, and were married by Jerry Falwell while he sat in his office in Lynchburg, Virginia.\n\nVirtually all major broadcasters now have a webcast of their output, from the BBC to CNN to Al Jazeera to UNTV in television to Radio China, Vatican Radio, United Nations Radio and the World Service in radio.\n\nOn November 4, 1994, Stef van der Ziel distributed the first live video images over the web from the Simplon venue in Groningen. On November 7, 1994, WXYC, the college radio station of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill became the first radio station in the world to broadcast its signal over the internet.\n\nTranslated versions including Subtitling are now possible using SMIL Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language.\n\nA wedcast is a webcast of a wedding. It allows family and friends of the couple to watch the wedding in real time on the Internet. It is sometimes used for weddings in exotic locations, such as Cancun and the Riviera Maya, Hawaii or the Caribbean, for which it is very expensive or difficult for people to travel to see the wedding in person.\n\nWebcasting a funeral is also a service provided by some funeral homes. Although it has been around for a decade, cheaper broadband, the financial strain of travel, and deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan have all led to a recent increase in this phenomenon.\n\n"}

{"id": "43209058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43209058", "title": "Zero-rating", "text": "Zero-rating\n\nZero-rating is the practice of providing Internet access without financial cost under certain conditions, such as by only permitting access to certain websites or by subsidizing the service with advertising. Commentators discussing zero rating often present it as a subtopic of net neutrality. While most sources report that use of zero-rating is contrary to the principle of net neutrality, there are mixed opinions among advocates of net neutrality about the extent to which people can benefit from zero-rating programs while retaining net neutrality protections. Supporters of zero-rating argue that it enables consumers to make choices to access more data and leads to more people using online services, but critics believe zero-rating exploits the poor, creates opportunities for censorship, and disrupts the free market.\n\nInternet services like Facebook, Wikipedia and Google have built special programs to use zero-rating as means to provide their service more broadly into developing markets. The benefit for these new customers, who will mostly have to rely on mobile networks to connect to the Internet, would be a subsidised access to services from these service providers. The results of these efforts have been mixed, with adoption in a number of markets, sometimes overestimated expectations and perceived lack of benefits for mobile network operators. In Chile, the national telecom regulator ruled that this practice violated net neutrality laws and had to end by June 1, 2014. The Federal Communications Commission did not ban zero-rating programs, but it \"acknowledged that they could violate the spirit of net neutrality\".\n\nSince June 2014, U.S. mobile provider T-Mobile US has offered zero-rated access to participating music streaming services to its mobile internet customers. T-Mobile launched its plan called ‚ÄúMusic Freedom‚Äù which would exempt users of T-Mobile from having to pay premium prices for access to music content; additionally, this content access would not count as part of an individual's cap, which is the limit they can reach before they are charged for data.\n\nIn November 2015, they expanded zero-rated access to video streaming services. In January 2016, Verizon joined AT&T by creating its own sponsored data program, FreeBee Data, which \"enables content providers to pay a wireless provider to allow its subscribers to engage with or consume a piece of content without it counting against the customers' monthly allotments\". Sponsored data on behalf of content providers through AT&T or Verizon covers the costs for the viewers and attracts more consumers. Some people have characterized this as ISPs having created a toll-free service for online users.\n\nAdvocates of net neutrality state that sponsored data \"allows well-heeled content providers to pay for placement to the disadvantage of smaller companies that can't afford the same luxury\". Verizon's FreeBee Data program which allows its own customers to access certain content, like ESPN and its video streaming service, for free along with any other relevant app access and the data will not count against their monthly caps. In this way, big ISPs discriminate against data and content from those who do not pay to have their content included in the FreeBee or other sponsored programs.\n\nSimilarly, mobile network operators are also able to use the underlying classification technology like deep packet inspection to redirect enterprise-related data charges for employees using their private tablets or smartphones to their employer. This has the benefit of Toll-free / zero-rated applications allowing employees to participate in \"bring your own device (BYOD)\" programs.\n\nZero-rating certain services, \"fast lanes\" and \"sponsored data\" have been criticised as anti-competitive and limiting open markets. It enables internet providers to gain a significant advantage in the promotion of in-house services over competing independent companies, especially in data-heavy markets like video-streaming. A service provider, who is offering unlimited access to their service, will naturally seem more favourable to consumers over one where usage is limited. If the first provider is the one restricting access, they are creating a considerable advantage for themselves over their competition, thereby restricting the freedom of the market. As many new internet and content services are launched targeting primarily mobile usage, and further adoption of internet connectivity globally (including broadband in rural areas of developed countries) relies heavily on mobile, zero-rating has also been regarded as a threat to the open internet, which is typically available via fixed line networks with unlimited usage tariffs or flat rates. Facebook and the Wikimedia Foundation have been specifically criticized for their zero-rating programs, to further strengthen incumbent mobile network operators and limit consumer rights to an open internet.\n\nThe concern raised about how zero-rating can violate net neutrality is that when companies pay large ISP‚Äôs, then that ISP will prioritize that given platform over others. This gives companies who are able to pay a large sum of money to an ISP an advantage over others who did not pay the premium cost. This idea violates net neutrality as it gives large companies a leg up in comparison to their smaller, less known counterparts. Net neutrality is centered on the idea that all ISP‚Äôs treat data contents equally, yet with T-Mobile‚Äôs example of ‚ÄúMusic Freedom‚Äù, net neutrality is no longer viable.\n\nThe United States has not officially made a decision on the regulation of zero-rating providers; instead, adopting a ‚Äúwait-and-see‚Äù approach to the matter. The FCC has therefore elected to examine on a case-by-case basis under a ‚Äúgeneral conduct rule‚Äù that ‚Äúprohibits unreasonable interference with end users‚Äô ability to select content and content providers‚Äô ability to reach end users‚Äù. Days before the Trump inauguration, the Obama Administration FCC issued a report expressing concerns with T-Mobile, Verizon and AT&T and their sponsored data programs. The FCC‚Äôs Wireless Telecommunications Bureau found issues in wireless broadband services that vertically integrate their own affiliated programming, along with service providers allowing unaffiliated content providers to sponsor data. The report concluded that vertically affiliated broadband providers that zero-rate affiliated content most likely violate the general conduct rule.\n\nIn the EU, specific cases such as those of Portugal were under scrutiny by national and EU regulators as of 2017, following the BEREC regulation on net neutrality. \n\nIn addition to commercial interests, governments with a cultural agenda may support zero-rating for local content.\n\nDevelopments in data protocols have made many Zero-rating practices ineffective, depending on how the website is accessed. For example, if HTTPS is used, it is impossible for an ISP to inject additional advertisements into the web page. If the user is using a VPN, it would be impossible for the ISP to restrict what sites the user has access to, as only the VPN provider can see the user's activity.\n\nThe following countries and telecommunications carriers currently offer these notable instances of zero-rated services.\n\n"}
