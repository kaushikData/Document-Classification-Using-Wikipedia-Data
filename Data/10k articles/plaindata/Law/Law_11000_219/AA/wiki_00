The changes were ultimately rejected by a majority of over 4,000 votes.\n\nThere were a total of 34 or 39 proposed amendments to the Constitution.\n\nAt a Constitutional convention in the middle of 2010, the subject of autonomy for American Samoa was discussed, with the issue being raised by the territory's non-voting member in the United States House of Representatives, Eni Faleomavaega. Resulting from this, the proposed Constitution replaced all mentions of \"Government of American Samoa\" with \"American Samoa Government\". Additionally, a paragraph in the preamble to the Constitution was proposed to be changed to reflect that American Samoans should \"have and enjoy certain rights ... including the right to local self-government\". Furthermore, if the changes were accepted, any federal American law seen as being harmful to the economy of the territory or the welfare of American Samoans could be blocked by the Fono.\n\nOther proposed changes to the Constitution included expanding the American Samoa House of Representatives from 20 members (plus one non-voting member from Swains Island) to 25 (plus one), and the American Samoa Senate from 18 to 22 members.\n\nThe power of the Governor of American Samoa's veto would have changed with the introduction of veto override into the Constitution, whereby a bill passed by a two-thirds majority by both houses of the American Samoa Fono within 14 months of an original veto will become law immediately. As the referendum failed, any vetoed law re-passed by the Fono still requires further approval by the Governor or the United States Secretary of the Interior. A prior referendum on the issue in 2008 failed by 112 votes, after original results showed a mere 22-vote margin.\n\nThe revised draft included a proposal to effect an order of succession should the office of Governor or Lieutenant Governor of American Samoa be vacant.\n\nThe new Constitution would have also provided a Samoan language curriculum in the territory's educational system, and introduced a system for post-secondary education to American Samoa. Additionally, it would have established a Public Utilities and Services Commission for the territory, and mandated the enforcement of immigration laws \"in order to protect the Samoan culture, lands and way of life\".\n\nDespite there being between 30 and 40 different proposed changes to the Constitution which had been approved at the Constitutional convention, all the changes were put to the polls together in a single-question referendum. Voters only had the choice to approve all or reject all the proposals, and could not vote on each one individually, resulting in criticism from voters.\n\nGovernor Togiola Tulafono was accused of presenting it as a single question in the poll because he wanted approval for all the changes, a charge he denied. The decision to put all the changes on the ballot as a single question had been made by the chief elections officer, who claimed it was \"the simplest way to put the question to voters.\"\n\nLimited public campaigning took place on the issue of rejecting the constitutional referendum. In Tualauta County in the Western District, the most heavily populated county in American Samoa, there was reportedly concentrated lobbying against the referendum, which was defeated by 609 votes.\n\nThe only other public campaigning occurred in Utulei and Tafuna, where a number of residents campaigned against the vote with an advertisement which centered around the decision of the chief elections officer to group all the proposed changes together. The advertisement complained that the amendments \"should have been separated, item by item and placed individually on the ballot; they weren't\".\n\nThe ballot contained the following sole question, printed in both English and Samoan in bold, block letters: \"Do you approve the 2010 amendments to the Revised Constitution of American Samoa?\" Voters had a choice of voting \"yes\" or \"no\".\n\nVoters rejected the amendments to the Constitution in all 17 electoral districts of American Samoa as well as in the absentee ballot poll.\n\n\n"}

United States, 568 U.S. 186 (2013), was a United States Supreme Court case concerning search and seizure. A 6–3 decision reversed the weapons conviction of a Long Island man who had been detained when police followed his vehicle after he left his apartment just before it was to be searched. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the majority opinion, and Antonin Scalia filed a concurrence. Stephen Breyer dissented.\n\nThe Second Circuit Court of Appeals had upheld the conviction. It accepted the government's argument that the Court's 1981 holding in \"Michigan v. Summers\" that persons in the immediate vicinity of a search can be detained while the search was being executed was broad enough to cover the pursuit and detention of a defendant who had left the scene in a vehicle. Kennedy's opinion held that it did not, since once Bailey had driven away none of the law-enforcement interests the earlier holding identified were involved. Scalia said that the only thing that mattered was that the vehicle was no longer in the immediate vicinity, and that balancing tests created confusion. Breyer argued that the police did, in fact, have those interests despite Bailey's departure by vehicle.\n\nOn Thursday, July 28, 2005 officers of the Suffolk County, New York, police department obtained a warrant to search the basement apartment of a house for a .380-caliber handgun. The warrant was obtained based on a tip by a confidential informant who told police officers that he had seen the gun on a previous weekend when purchasing drugs at the apartment from a man named \"Polo.\"\n\nBefore executing the search warrant, two officers surveilling the apartment observed two men exit the apartment complex, both of whom matched the description provided by the confidential informant. The officers watched the men get into a car and drive away.\n\nThe officers followed the two individuals for approximately 5 minutes or one mile, and then pulled the men over. They ordered the men out of the car and conducted a pat down search, which turned no weapons or contraband. The officers then seized the driver's keys and handcuffed both men. The officers told them men that they were not under arrest, but were being detained incident to the execution of the search warrant.\n\nThe officers drove the two men back to the apartment, which by then had been secured and searched by other officers. The search turned up multiple guns, ammunition, drugs and drug paraphernalia. Both men were then formally placed under arrest.\n\nChunon L. Bailey, one of the two men arrested, was charged with possessing cocaine with the intent to distribute and possessing a firearm as a felon. He moved to suppress the evidence based on his unlawful detention after he had already left his apartment. The trial court rejected that motion, holding that the detention was justified under \"Michigan v. Summers\". The defendant was convicted and, on appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit agreed.\n\nIn \"Michigan v. Summers\", 452 U.S. 692 (1981), the Court adopted the categorical rule that officers executing a search warrant for contraband may detain the occupants of the premises while the search is conducted. In the ruling, three justifications were identified for detaining occupants while executing a search warrant: (1) the legitimate law enforcement interest in preventing flight in the event that incriminating evidence is found, (2) the interest in minimizing the risk of harm to the officers, and (3) the orderly completion of the search, which may be facilitated if the occupants of the premises are present. This case presents the question whether the rule of Summers extends to the detention of a former occupant who has left the immediate vicinity of the premises before the warrant is executed.\n\nMultiple scholars have questioned the efficacy of applying \"Michigan v. Summers\" to individuals who have departed the premises being searched.  One commentator, in examining the application of \"Michigan v. Summers\" over the course of thirty years, acknowledged the lack of clarity in the Supreme Court's original decision as to whether the categorical rule that occupants may be detained applies to \"recent occupants\":\n\nHe argues that this is one way in which the rule from \"Michigan v. Summers\" has been \"extended well beyond what the Court’s initial rationale should reasonably allow\" and, as a result, has \"put at risk the very liberty interests that it was designed to protect.\"\n\nIn a 6–3 decision, the Court reversed and remanded the Second Circuit Court's ruling, stating that it was an unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment. Writing for the majority, Justice Kennedy agreed that the\" Michigan v. Summers \"ruling was broad enough to cover the pursuit and detention of a suspect who had left the scene. However, because none of the law-enforcement interests the earlier holding identified were involved, officers did not have probable cause in this case to detain the suspects a mile away from the scene before the apartment was searched, and it thus added an additional level of intrusiveness: \"As demonstrated here, detention beyond the immediate vicinity can involve an initial detention away from the scene and a second detention at the residence. In between, the individual will suffer the additional indignity of a compelled transfer back to the premises\".\n\nJustice Scalia concurred in the judgment. Joined by Justices Ginsburg and Kagan, he however argued that once suspects leave the immediate vicinity, the scope and balancing tests of the \"Michigan v. Summers\" ruling should no longer apply because ordinary law enforcement interests would then take over: \"The Summers exception is appropriately predicated only on law enforcement's interest in carrying out the search unimpeded by violence or other disruptions ... Preventing flight is not a special governmental interest—it is indistinguishable from the ordinary interest in apprehending suspects. Similarly, the interest in inducing residents to open locked doors or containers [to facilitate the orderly completion of the search] is nothing more than the ordinary interest in investigating crime\".\n\nJustice Breyer, joined with Justices Thomas and Alito, filed a dissenting opinion. Breyer argued that officers did, in fact, have those law-enforcement interests, but also had reasonable justifications for stopping the suspects away from their apartment. \"Considerations related to the risks of flight, of evidence destruction, and of physical danger overcome any administrative advantages. Consider why the officers here waited until the occupants had left the block to stop them: They did so because the occupants might have been armed\".\n"}

The draft constitution was rejected, eventually culminating in a coup d'état.\n\nThe country we now know as the Netherlands had declared independence as the Republic of the Seven United Provinces () in 1581. This independence was officially recognized in the Peace of Westphalia of 1648. As the name indicates, the country was a federation of seven autonomous provinces: the duchy of Gelre, the counties of Holland and Zeeland, the former bishopric of Utrecht, the lordship of Overijssel and the free provinces of Friesland and Groningen. Each province was governed by the Provincial States; the main executive official was a stadtholder (\"stadhouder\" in Dutch). Over the years, these stadtholderships were concentrated among the descendants of William the Silent.\n\nThis led to a friction with the \"regenten\", the wealthy merchant class, who were mainly based in Amsterdam. They saw the central position of the House of Orange-Nassau in Dutch politics as a threat to their own power. The infighting between the regents and the Orangists was one of the causes of the downturn of the Netherlands as a global economic and military power throughout the 18th century.\n\nIn the 1780s, the tensions came to a head in the Batavian Revolution, a struggle between republican Patriots and royalist Orangists. The Patriots, aided by French troops, eventually managed to drive stadtholder William V out of the country in late 1794. A few weeks later, on January 19, 1795, the Batavian Republic was proclaimed.\n\nThe \"Nationale Vergadering\" (National Assembly) subsequently went through two years of discussions. On May 10, 1797, a final draft constitution was formed. The constitution was a compromise between two groups: those who felt that the \"gewesten\" (regions) in the Republic should maintain their historic autonomy, and those who felt that the Republic should become a unitary state.\n\nThe draft constitution had been rejected by almost eighty percent, which meant that a new Constitution would have to be drafted. In the elections for the National Assembly a few months later, the supporters of a unitary state won the majority, but the supporters of a federal state retained the majority in the constitutional commission. Meanwhile, in France, the radicalists led by Pierre Augereau had seized power. With French help, the radical unitarists staged a coup d'état in January 1798. A new constitution, establishing a unitary republic, was quickly adopted in the National Assembly. This draft constitution was approved in a referendum on April 23, 1798.\n"}

It has been attributed to John le Breton, bishop of Hereford, on the authority of a passage found in some MSS. of the history of Matthew of Westminster; there are difficulties, however, involved in this theory, inasmuch as the bishop of Hereford died in 1275, whereas allusions are made in \"Britton\" to several statutes passed after that time, and more particularly to the well-known statute \"Quia emptores\", which was passed in 1290. It was the opinion of John Selden that the book derived its title from Henry de Bracton, the last of the chief justiciaries, whose name is sometimes spelled in the fine rolls \"Bratton\" and \"Bretton\", and that it was a royal abridgment of Bracton's great work on the customs and laws of England, with the addition of certain subsequent statutes. The arrangement, however, of the two works is different, and but a small proportion of Bracton's work is incorporated in \"Britton\". The work is entitled in an early manuscript of the 14th century, which was once in the possession of Selden, and is now in the Cambridge University Library, \"Summa de legibus Anglie que vocatur Bretone\"; and it is described as \"a book called Bretoun\" in the will of Andrew Horn, the learned chamberlain of the City of London, who bequeathed it to the chamber of the Guildhall in 1329, together with another book called \"Mirroir des Justices\".\n\n\"Britton\" was first printed in London by Robert Redman, without a date, probably about the year 1530. Another edition of it was printed in 1640, corrected by Edmund Wingate. A third edition of it, with an English translation, was published at the University Press, Oxford, 1865, by F. M. Nichol. An English translation of the work without the French text had been previously published by Robert Kelham in 1762.\n\n"}

The 142nd episode of the series overall, it first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 5, 2006. It is the first part of a two-episode story-arc, which concludes with \"Cartoon Wars Part II\". In the episode, it is announced that a \"Family Guy\" episode will air with the Muslim prophet Muhammad as a character, leaving the whole of the United States fearing for their lives. Cartman apparently believes that the episode is offensive to Muslims and decides to go to Hollywood to try to get the episode pulled.\n\nThe episode was written by series co-creator Trey Parker. Parker and fellow series co-creator Matt Stone originally planned for this episode to be the first of season ten, but disagreements with Comedy Central regarding the depiction of Muhammad forced them to postpone it until later in the season. Once production on the episode began, the dispute still had not been resolved, so it was decided that the story would be split into two separate episodes to allow for more negotiations between the two sides. A similar story-arc was used in the season fourteen episodes \"200\" and \"201\".\n\nThe townspeople of South Park are in a panic late one night when they discover that a cartoon is going to show an episode featuring Muhammad as a character. Everyone hides in the Community Center for fear of an Islamic terrorist attack and Randy announces that the cartoon is \"Family Guy\". The next morning, everyone is thrilled to find out that there was no attack and that Fox censored the image of Muhammad.\n\nIt is later announced that the \"Family Guy\" episode was just part one of a two-parter, and that part two will air the following week—without censorship. Cartman believes that this is insulting to Muslims, declaring that Fox was right to censor Muhammad. Kyle, who likes \"Family Guy\", thinks that he is faking, but, when Cartman gives an impassioned speech about keeping people from getting hurt, Kyle is guilt-ridden and believes him. Kyle agrees to go with Cartman to Hollywood to get the \"Family Guy\" episode pulled.\n\nThe people of South Park, meanwhile, decide to literally bury their heads in the sand, so as to show Islamists that they have no part in the insult. On the way to Hollywood, Kyle discovers that Cartman only wants to get \"Family Guy\" cancelled and does not care about the Muslims. Cartman decides to go at it alone, but Kyle insists he will not let that happen. The two start racing one another on their Big Wheels, until Cartman successfully loses Kyle.\n\nU.S. President George W. Bush meets with the Fox executives. The Fox president says that there is something secret about the \"Family Guy\" writers that Bush needs to know. At this point, it is revealed this is a two-part episode and that the conclusion will be given in the next episode.\n\nIn the DVD commentaries for season ten, series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone spoke about how they experienced difficulties with Comedy Central during the production of \"Cartoon Wars Part I\" and \"Cartoon Wars Part II\". They originally wanted to open season ten with these episodes, but were forced to postpone them until later in the season, due to Comedy Central not approving of the depiction of Muhammad. Instead, the season opened with \"The Return of Chef\", after one of the show's former actors, Isaac Hayes, released a statement bad-mouthing \"South Park\" over a previous dispute. Even as Parker and Stone continued to work on \"Cartoon Wars\", the dispute between them and the network had still not been resolved. As a result, the plot was developed into a two-part story-arc to allow for more negotiations between the two sides.\n\nParker and Stone also clarified their opinions on \"Family Guy\"; Parker stated: \"we do hate it [...] we understand that people love it [...] we certainly don't think it should be taken off the air [...] we just don't respect it in terms of writing\". The two later referred to the writers behind the show as \"smart\" but emphatically criticized their overuse of \"gag-humor\". After \"Cartoon Wars Part I\" aired, Parker and Stone said that they were contacted by the staff of \"The Simpsons\" and \"King of the Hill\", who both gave praise for lampooning \"Family Guy\". Parker said that the staff of \"The Simpsons\" hate \"Family Guy\" more than they do, and that \"King of the Hill\"s staff said to them, \"you're doing God's work\". The depictions of Bart Simpson and \"King of the Hill\"s writing staff in \"Cartoon Wars Part II\" were influenced by the two shows contacting \"South Park\". Parker and Stone also expressed a level of disappointment with how the episode was received. They felt that people ignored the scope of the Muhammad plot elements and found that more trivial aspects of the show received more attention than they deserved.\n\nThe season fourteen episodes \"200\" and \"201\" also feature a story-arc involving depictions of Muhammad and censorship in general. Like \"Cartoon Wars Part I\" and \"Cartoon Wars Part II\", \"200\" and particularly \"201\" caused a large amount of controversy.\n\nEric Goldman of \"IGN\" gave the episode a 7.0 out of 10, praising the depiction of \"Family Guy\" and the cliffhanger ending. In an article apart of a series analyzing television episodes that \"exemplify the spirit of [their] time and the properties that make television a unique medium\", \"The A.V. Club\"s Noel Murray praised the episode, citing it and \"Cartoon Wars Part II\" as a good example of Parker and Stone's ability to satirize various forms of media and still be able to write quality episodes despite a large amount of controversy. Seth MacFarlane, creator of \"Family Guy\", called the episode \"funny and accurate.\"\n\n\"Cartoon Wars Part I\", along with the fourteen other episodes from \"South Park\"s tenth season, was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on August 21, 2007. The set includes brief audio commentaries by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone for each episode.\n\n\n"}

The 1902 Franchise Act set uniform national franchise criteria, establishing the voting age at 21 years and women's suffrage at the national level, also a right to stand for election to the Parliament. That Act also disqualified from voting a number of categories of people, including Indigenous peoples from Australian, Asia, Africa and the Pacific Islands (except New Zealand Maori), even if citizens of the British Empire. A plurality voting system (\"first-past-the-post\") was established. The 1902 Act also made it clear that no person could vote more than once at each election. The 1902 Act was amended in 1906 to allow postal voting. In 1908, a permanent electoral roll was established and in 1911 it became compulsory for eligible voters to enrol. Compulsory enrolment led to a large increase in voter turnout, even though voting was still voluntary. From 1912, elections have been held on Saturdays.\n\nThe 1918 Act was introduced by the Nationalist Party of Billy Hughes, the main purpose of which was to replace first-past-the-post voting with instant-runoff voting (\"preferential voting\") for the House of Representatives and the Senate. It continues to be the core legislation governing the conduct of elections in Australia, having been amended on numerous occasions since 1918.\n\nThe 1918 Act replaced the \"Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902\" and the \"Commonwealth Electoral Act\" 1902. It replaced first-past-the-post voting with instant-runoff voting (\"preferential voting\") for the House of Representatives and the Senate. (Preferential voting had been pioneered by Queensland in 1892.) The voting system was changed by the anti-Labor Hughes after the 1918 Swan by-election, which saw the Labor candidate win with 34% of the vote due to a split in the anti-Labor vote between the Nationalist and Country Party candidates, with 29.6% and 31.4% respectively.\n\nThe Act also repeated the special jurisdiction of the High Court of Australia as the Court of Disputed Returns in federal election matters, initially established by Part XVI of the \"Commonwealth Electoral Act 1902\".\n\nIn 1921, the Act was amended to disqualify anyone standing for federal parliament who \"has resigned from the Parliament of a State and has the right, under the law of the State, if not elected to the Parliament of the Commonwealth, to be re-elected to the Parliament of the State without the holding of a poll\". This amendment was made specifically to overrule an act passed by the Queensland state government, which allowed state MPs to automatically return to parliament without a by-election if they ran unsuccessfully for federal parliament. The Queensland government reportedly passed the legislation primarily for the benefit of Frank Forde, a future prime minister.\n\nCompulsory voting at federal elections was introduced in 1924, as a condition of the Country Party agreeing to form an alliance with the then minority Nationalist Party. Compulsory voting saw voter turnout increasing from 59.36% to 91.39% at the 1925 federal election. \n\nThe Chifley Government amended the Electoral Act in 1949, in time for the 1949 federal election, as follows:\nAlthough in 1948 (effective in 1949) Australian nationality law had been altered to create an Australian citizenship, the nationality criterion for the franchise remained that of being a British subject.\n\nIn 1962, the Menzies Government extended the franchise to Indigenous Australians at federal elections, though enrolment was voluntary.\n\nChanges to the Electoral Act in 1973 by the Whitlam Government included:\n\nChanges to the Electoral Act in 1984 by the Hawke Government included:\n\nIn 2016 the registered preference part of the Senate group ticket voting system was abolished, to avoid undue influence of preference deals experienced in 2013, and especially cascading preference deals (which are unlikely to be obvious to most voters).\n\n"}
{"id": "1221389", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1221389", "title": "Customary international law", "text": "Customary international law\n\nCustomary international law is an aspect of international law involving the principle of custom. Along with general principles of law and treaties, custom is considered by the International Court of Justice, jurists, the United Nations, and its member states to be among the primary sources of international law.\n\nMany governments accept in principle the existence of customary international law, although there are differing opinions as to what rules are contained in it.\n\nIn 1950, the International Law Commission listed the following sources as forms of evidence to customary international law: treaties, decisions of national and international courts, national legislation, opinions of national legal advisors, diplomatic correspondence, and practice of international organizations.\n\nThe International Court of Justice Statute defines customary international law in Article 38(1)(b) as \"a general practice accepted as law.\" This is generally determined through two factors: the general practice of states and what states have accepted as law.\n\nThere are several kinds of customary international laws recognized by states. Some customary international laws rise to the level of \"jus cogens\" through acceptance by the international community as non-derogable rights, while other customary international law may simply be followed by a small group of states. States are typically bound by customary international law regardless of whether the states have codified these laws domestically or through treaties.\n\n\"See jus cogens.\"\n\nA peremptory norm (also called \"jus cogens\", Latin for \"compelling law\") is a fundamental principle of international law which is accepted by the international community of states as a norm from which no derogation is ever permitted. These norms rooted from Natural Law principles, and any laws conflicting with it should be considered null and void.\nExamples include various international crimes; a state violates customary international law if it permits or engages in slavery, torture, genocide, war of aggression, or crimes against humanity \n\n\"Jus cogens\" and customary international law are not interchangeable. All \"jus cogens\" are customary international law through their adoption by states, but not all customary international laws rise to the level of peremptory norms. States can deviate from customary international law by enacting treaties and conflicting laws, but \"jus cogens\" are non-derogable.\n\nSome international customary laws have been codified through treaties and domestic laws, while others are recognized only as customary law.\n\nThe laws of war, also known as \"jus in bello\", were long a matter of customary law before they were codified in the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, Geneva Conventions, and other treaties. However, these conventions do not purport to govern all legal matters that may arise during war. Instead, Article 1(2) of Additional Protocol I dictates that customary international law governs legal matters concerning armed conflict not covered by other agreements.\n\nGenerally, sovereign nations must consent in order to be bound by a particular treaty or legal norm. However, international customary laws are norms that have become pervasive enough internationally that countries need not consent in order to be bound. In these cases, all that is needed is that the state has not objected to the law. However, states that object to customary international law may not be bound by them unless these laws are deemed to be \"jus cogens\". However, in a dispute with any nation that has not affirmed the \"silence implies consent\" principle, any invocation of the \"silence implies consent\" principle involves an appeal to custom, such that if that nation does not espouse the broader premise of acknowledging the existence of customary international law, such an appeal will depend on circular reasoning (\"customary international law is binding because silence implies consent, and silence implies consent because the fact that silence implies consent is one aspect of customary international law\").\n\nConsent and International Customary Law\n\nIt is commonly said that the international community is ‘anarchical’, in that there is no layer of higher government with absolute power to treat states like citizens. This is in a way unsurprising, since most states could (if pressed) rely solely on themselves for survival. States are thus in a position, unlike individual humans, to refuse the benefits and reciprocal responsibilities of participating in a community under law.\n\nIn recognition of this reality, it has long been a tenet of international law that a state must expressly consent to a rule (by, for example, signing a treaty) before it can be legally bound by the rule. Customary international law not only upsets this idea of consent, it does it by stealth.\n\nThe Statute of the International Court of Justice acknowledges the existence of customary international law in Article 38(1)(b), incorporated into the United Nations Charter by Article 92: \"The Court, whose function is to decide in accordance with international law such disputes as are submitted to it, shall apply...international custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law.\"\n\nCustomary international law \"... consists of rules of law derived from the consistent conduct of States acting out of the belief that the law required them to act that way.\" It follows that customary international law can be discerned by a \"widespread repetition by States of similar international acts over time (State practice); Acts must occur out of sense of obligation (\"opinio juris\"); Acts must be taken by a significant number of States and not be rejected by a significant number of States.\" A marker of customary international law is consensus among states exhibited both by widespread conduct and a discernible sense of obligation.\n\nThe two essential elements of customary international law are state practice and \"opinio juris\", as confirmed by the International Court of Justice in the \"Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons\".\n\nIn relation to the psychological element that is \"opinio juris\", the International Court of Justice further held in \"North Sea Continental Shelf\", that \"not only must the acts concerned amount to a settle practice, but they must also be such, or be carried out in such a way, as to be evidence of a belief that this practice is rendered obligatory by the existence of a rule of law requiring it... The States concerned must therefore feel that they are conforming to what amounts to a legal obligation.\". The Court emphasised the need to prove a \"sense of legal duty\" as distinct from \"acts motivated by considerations of courtesy, convenience or tradition\". This was subsequently confirmed in \"Nicaragua v. United States of America\".\n\nThe recognition of different customary laws can range from simple bilateral recognition of customary laws to worldwide multilateral recognition. Regional customs can become customary international law in their respective regions, but do not become customary international law for nations outside the region. The existence of bilateral customary law was recognized by the International Court of Justice in the \"Right of Passage Over Indian Territory\" case between Portugal and India, in which the court found \"no reason why long continued practice between the two states accepted by them as regulating their relations should not form the basis of mutual rights and obligations between the two states.\"\n\nOther examples accepted or claimed as customary international law include the principle of non-refoulement and immunity of visiting foreign heads of state. United Nations Security Council in 1993 adopted Geneva conventions as customary international law because since the time being it has transformed itself into customary international law. If any treaty or law has been called as customary international law then parties which have not ratified said treaty will be bound to observe its provisions in good faith.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25037165", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25037165", "title": "Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act", "text": "Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act\n\nThe Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (, , commonly referred to as Dodd–Frank) was signed into United States federal law by US President Barack Obama on July 21, 2010.\nPassed in response to the 2008 global financial crisis, the Act brought the most significant changes to financial regulation in the nation since the regulatory reform that came following the Great Recession. It made changes in the American financial regulatory environment affecting all federal financial regulatory agencies and almost every part of the nation's financial services industry.\n\nThe law was initially proposed by the Obama administration in June 2009, when the White House sent several proposed bills to Congress. The legislation was introduced in the House in July 2009. On December 2, 2009, revised versions of the bill were introduced in the House of Representatives by then-Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank, and in the Senate Banking Committee by former Chairman Chris Dodd. Dodd and Frank were both involved with the bill; the conference committee that reported on June 25, 2010 voted to name the bill after both men.\n\nStudies have found the Dodd–Frank Act has improved financial stability and consumer protection, although there has been debate regarding its economic effects. The Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which from inception to April 2017 had \"returned almost $12 billion to 29 million consumers and imposed about $600 million in civil penalties.\"\n\nOn June 8, 2017, the Republican-led House passed the Financial CHOICE Act which, if enacted, would roll back many of the provisions of Dodd–Frank. In June 2017, the Senate was crafting its own reform bill.\n\nOn March 14, 2018, the US Senate passed a bill by a 67 to 31 vote, easing financial regulations and reducing oversight for banks with assets below $250 billion. The law passed the House of Representatives on May 22, 2018 in a 258–159 vote. The legislation was then signed into law by US President Donald Trump on May 24, 2018.\n\nThe financial crisis of 2007–2010 led to widespread calls for changes in the regulatory system. In June 2009, President Obama introduced a proposal for a \"sweeping overhaul of the United States financial regulatory system, a transformation on a scale not seen since the reforms that followed the Great Depression\".\n\nAs the finalized bill emerged from conference, President Obama said that it included 90 percent of the reforms he had proposed. Major components of Obama's original proposal, listed by the order in which they appear in the \"A New Foundation\" outline, include:\n\nAt President Obama's request, Congress later added the Volcker Rule to this proposal in January 2010.\n\nThe bills that came after Obama's proposal were largely consistent with the proposal, but contained some additional provisions and differences in implementation.\n\nThe Volcker Rule was not included in Obama's initial June 2009 proposal, but Obama proposed the rule later in January 2010, after the House bill had passed. The rule, which prohibits depository banks from proprietary trading (similar to the prohibition of combined investment and commercial banking in the Glass–Steagall Act), was passed only in the Senate bill, and the conference committee enacted the rule in a weakened form, Section 619 of the bill, that allowed banks to invest up to 3% of their Tier 1 capital in private equity and hedge funds as well as trade for hedging purposes.\n\nThe initial version of the bill passed the House largely along party lines in December by a vote of 223–202, and passed the Senate with amendments in May 2010 with a vote of 59–39 again largely along party lines. The bill then moved to conference committee, where the Senate bill was used as the base text although a few House provisions were included in the bill's base text.\n\nOne provision on which the White House did not take a position and remained in the final bill allows the SEC to rule on \"proxy access\" – meaning that qualifying shareholders, including groups, can modify the corporate proxy statement sent to shareholders to include their own director nominees, with the rules set by the SEC. This rule was unsuccessfully challenged in conference committee by Chris Dodd, who – under pressure from the White House – submitted an amendment limiting that access and ability to nominate directors only to single shareholders who have over 5% of the company and have held the stock for at least two years.\n\nThe \"Durbin amendment\" is a provision in the final bill aimed at reducing debit card interchange fees for merchants and increasing competition in payment processing. The provision was not in the House bill; it began as an amendment to the Senate bill from Dick Durbin and led to lobbying against it.\n\nThe \"New York Times\" published a comparison of the two bills prior to their reconciliation. On June 25, 2010, conferees finished reconciling the House and Senate versions of the bills and four days later filed a conference report. The conference committee changed the name of the Act from the \"Restoring American Financial Stability Act of 2010\". The House passed the conference report, 237–192 on June 30, 2010. On July 15, the Senate passed the Act, 60–39. President Obama signed the bill into law on July 21, 2010.\n\nOn June 9, 2017, The Financial Choice Act, legislation that would \"undo significant parts\" of Dodd-Frank, passed the House 233–186.\n\nThe Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is categorized into sixteen titles and, by one law firm's count, it requires that regulators create 243 rules, conduct 67 studies, and issue 22 periodic reports.\n\nThe stated aim of the legislation is:\n\nThe Act changes the existing regulatory structure, by creating a number of new agencies (while merging and removing others) in an effort to streamline the regulatory process, increasing oversight of specific institutions regarded as a systemic risk, amending the Federal Reserve Act, promoting transparency, and additional changes. The Act's intentions are to provide rigorous standards and supervision to protect the economy and American consumers, investors and businesses; end taxpayer-funded bailouts of financial institutions; provide for an advanced warning system on the stability of the economy; create new rules on executive compensation and corporate governance; and eliminate certain loopholes that led to the 2008 economic recession. The new agencies are either granted explicit power over a particular aspect of financial regulation, or that power is transferred from an existing agency. All of the new agencies, and some existing ones that are not currently required to do so, are also compelled to report to Congress on an annual (or biannual) basis, to present the results of current plans and explain future goals. Important new agencies created include the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the Office of Financial Research, and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.\n\nOf the existing agencies, changes are proposed, ranging from new powers to the transfer of powers in an effort to enhance the regulatory system. The institutions affected by these changes include most of the regulatory agencies currently involved in monitoring the financial system (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Federal Reserve (the \"Fed\"), the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), etc.), and the final elimination of the Office of Thrift Supervision (further described in Title III – Transfer of Powers to the Comptroller, the FDIC, and the FED).\n\nAs a practical matter, prior to the passage of Dodd–Frank, investment advisers were not required to register with the SEC if the investment adviser had fewer than 15 clients during the previous 12 months and did not hold itself out generally to the public as an investment adviser. The act eliminates that exemption, thereby rendering numerous additional investment advisers, hedge funds, and private equity firms subject to new registration requirements.\n\nCertain non-bank financial institutions and their subsidiaries will be supervised by the Fed in the same manner and to the same extent as if they were a bank holding company.\n\nTo the extent that the Act affects all federal financial regulatory agencies, eliminating one (the Office of Thrift Supervision) and creating two (Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Office of Financial Research) in addition to several consumer protection agencies, including the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, this legislation in many ways represents a change in the way America's financial markets will operate in the future. Few provisions of the Act became effective when the bill was signed.\n\nTitle I, or the \"Financial Stability Act of 2010\", outlines two new agencies tasked to monitor systemic risk and research the state of the economy and clarifies the comprehensive supervision of bank holding companies by the Federal Reserve.\n\nTitle I creates the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and the Office of Financial Research (OFR) in the U.S. Treasury Department. These two agencies are designed to work closely together. The Council is formed of 10 voting members, 9 of whom are federal regulators and 5 non-voting supporting members, to encourage interagency collaboration and knowledge transfer. The Treasury Secretary is Chair of the Council, and the Head of the Financial Research Office is appointed by the President with confirmation from the Senate.\n\nTitle I introduced the ability to impose stricter regulations on certain institutions by classifying them as SIFI's (systemically important financial institutions); according to Paul Krugman, this has allowed institutions to reduce risk-taking so they could to avoid such classification.\n\nUnder section 165d, certain institutions must prepare resolution plans (so-called \"living wills\"), the first round of which was rejected by the Federal Reserve System in 2014.\nThe process can be seen as a way to regulate and reduce shadow banking activities by banking institutions.\n\nThe Financial Stability Oversight Council is tasked to identify threats to the financial stability of the United States, promote market discipline, and respond to emerging risks in order to stabilize the United States financial system. At a minimum, it must meet quarterly.\n\nThe Council is required to report to Congress on the state of the financial system, and may direct the Office of Financial Research to conduct research. Notable powers include:\n\nThe Office of Financial Research is designed to support the Financial Stability Oversight Council through data collection and research. The Director has subpoena power and may require from any financial institution (bank or non-bank) any data needed to carry out the functions of the office. The Office can also issue guidelines to standardizing the way data is reported, constituent agencies have three years to implement data standardization guidelines.\n\nIt is intended to be self-funded through the Financial Research Fund within 2 years of enactment, with the Federal Reserve providing funding in the initial interim period.\n\nIn many ways, the Office of Financial Research is to be operated without the constraints of the Civil Service system. For example, it does not need to follow federal pay scale guidelines (see above), and it is mandated that the office have workforce development plans that are designed to ensure that it can attract and retain technical talent, which it is required to report about Congressional committees for its first 5 years.\n\nBefore Dodd–Frank, federal laws to handle the liquidation and receivership of federally regulated banks existed for supervised banks, insured depository institutions, and securities companies by the FDIC or Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). Dodd–Frank expanded these laws to potentially handle insurance companies and non-bank financial companies, and changed these liquidation laws in certain ways. Once it is determined that a financial company satisfied the criteria for liquidation, if the financial company's board of directors does not agree, provisions are made for judicial appeal. Depending on the type of financial institution, different regulatory organizations may jointly or independently, by 2/3 vote, determine whether a receiver should be appointed for a financial company:\n\nProvided that the Secretary of Treasury, in consultation with the President, may also determine to appoint a receiver for a financial company. Also, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) shall review and report to Congress about the Secretary's decision.\n\nWhen a financial institution is placed into receivership under these provisions, within 24 hours, the Secretary shall report to Congress. Also, within 60 days, there shall be a report to the general public. The report on recommending to place a financial company into receivership shall contain various details on the state of the company, the impact of its default on the company, and the proposed action.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, the FDIC is the liquidator for financial institutions who are not banking members (like the SIPC) nor insurance companies (such as the FDIC). In taking action under this title, the FDIC shall comply with various requirements:\n\nTo the extent that the Act expanded the scope of financial firms that may be liquidated by the federal government, beyond the existing authorities of the FDIC and SIPC, there had to be an additional source of funds, independent of the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund, used in case of a non-bank or non-security financial company's liquidation. The Orderly Liquidation Fund is to be an FDIC-managed fund, to be used by the FDIC in the event of a covered financial company's liquidation that is not covered by FDIC or SIPC.\n\nInitially, the Fund is to be capitalized over a period no shorter than five years, but no longer than ten; however, in the event the FDIC must make use of the Fund before it is fully capitalized, the Secretary of the Treasury and the FDIC are permitted to extend the period as determined necessary. The method of capitalization is by collecting risk-based assessment fees on any \"eligible financial company\" – which is defined as \"[...] any bank holding company with total consolidated assets equal to or greater than $50 billion and any nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors\". The severity of the assessment fees can be adjusted on an as-needed basis (depending on economic conditions and other similar factors) and the relative size and value of a firm is to play a role in determining the fees to be assessed. The eligibility of a financial company to be subject to the fees is periodically reevaluated; or, in other words, a company that does not qualify for fees in the present, will be subject to the fees in the future if they cross the 50 billion line, or become subject to Federal Reserve scrutiny.\n\nTo the extent that a covered financial company has a negative net worth and its liquidation creates an obligation to the FDIC as its liquidator, the FDIC shall charge one or more risk-based assessment such that the obligation will be paid off within 60 months (5 years) of the issuance of the obligation. The assessments will be charged to any bank holding company with consolidated assets greater than $50 billion and any nonbank financial company supervised by the Federal Reserve. Under certain conditions, the assessment may be extended to regulated banks and other financial institutions.\n\nAssessments will be implemented according to a matrix that the Financial Stability Oversight Council recommends to the FDIC. The matrix shall take into account:\n\nWhen liquidating a financial company under this title (as opposed to FDIC or SIPD) there is a maximum limit of the Government's liquidation obligation, i.e., the Government's obligation can not exceed:\n\nIn the event that the Fund and other sources of capital are insufficient, the FDIC is authorized to buy and sell securities on behalf of the company (or companies) in receivership to raise additional capital. Taxpayers shall bear no losses from liquidating any financial company under this title and any losses shall be the responsibility of the financial sector, recovered through assessments:\n\nEstablished inside the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, the Panel is tasked with evaluating the conclusion of the Secretary of Treasury that a company is in (or in danger of) default. The Panel consists of three bankruptcy judges drawn from the District of Delaware, all of whom are appointed by the Chief Judge of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. In his appointments, the Chief Judge is instructed to weigh the financial expertise of the candidates. If the Panel concurs with the Secretary, the company in question is permitted to be placed into receivership; if they do not concur, the Secretary has an opportunity to amend and refile his or her petition. In the event that a Panel decision is appealed, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has jurisdiction; in the event of further appeal, a writ of certiorari may be filed with the U.S. Supreme Court. In all appellate events, the scope of review is limited to whether the decision of the Secretary that a company is in (or in danger of) default is supported by substantial evidence.\n\nTitle III, or the \"Enhancing Financial Institution Safety and Soundness Act of 2010\", is designed to streamline banking regulation. Also, it is intended to reduce competition and overlaps between different regulators by abolishing the Office of Thrift Supervision and transferring its power over the appropriate holding companies to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, state savings associations to the FDIC, and other thrifts to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The thrift charter is to remain, although weakened. Additional changes include:\n\nTitle IV, or the \"Private Fund Investment Advisers Registration Act of 2010\", requires certain previously exempt investment advisers to register as investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Most notably, it requires many hedge fund managers and private equity fund managers to register as advisers for the first time. Also, the act increases the reporting requirements of investment advisors as well as limiting these advisors' ability to exclude information in reporting to many of the federal government agencies.\n\nTitle V - Insurance is split into two subtitles: A.) Federal Insurance Office, and B.) State-Based Insurance Reform.\n\nSubtitle A, also called the \"Federal Insurance Office Act of 2010\", establishes the Federal Insurance Office within the Treasury Department, which is tasked with:\n\nThe Office is headed by a director appointed for a career-reserved term by the Secretary of the Treasury.\n\nGenerally, the Insurance Office may require any insurer company to submit such data as may be reasonably required in carrying out the functions of the Office.\n\nA state insurance measure shall be preempted if, and only to the extent that the Director determines that the measure results in a less favorable treatment of a non-US insurer whose parent corporation is located in a nation with an agreement or treaty with the US.\n\nSubtitle B, also called the \"Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act of 2010\" applies to nonadmitted insurance and reinsurance. Regarding to nonadmitted insurance, the Act provides that the placement of nonadmitted insurance will only be subject to the statutory and regulatory requirements of the insured's home state, and that no state, other than the insured's home state, may require a surplus lines broker to be licensed to sell, solicit, or negotiate nonadmitted insurance respecting the insured. The Act also provides that no state, other than the insured's home state, may require any premium tax payment for nonadmitted insurance. However, states may enter into a compact or otherwise establish procedures to allocate among the states the premium taxes paid to an insured's home state. A state may not collect any fees in relation to the licensing of an individual or entity as a surplus lines broker in the state unless that state has in effect by July 21, 2012 laws or regulations providing for participation by the state in the NAIC's national insurance producer database, or any other equivalent uniform national database, for the licensure of surplus lines brokers and the renewal of these licenses.\n\nTitle VI, or the \"Bank and Savings Association Holding Company and Depository Institution Regulatory Improvements Act of 2010\", introduces the so-called \"Volcker Rule\" after former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker by amending the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. With aiming to reduce the amount of speculative investments on the balance sheets of large firms, it limits banking entities to owning no more than 3% in a hedge fund or private equity fund of the total ownership interest. All of the banking entity's interests in hedge funds or private equity funds cannot exceed 3% of the banking entity's Tier 1 capital. Furthermore, no bank with a direct or indirect relationship with a hedge fund or private equity fund \"may enter into a transaction with the fund, or with any other hedge fund or private equity fund that is controlled by such fund\" without disclosing the relationship's full extent to the regulating entity, and assuring that there is no conflict of interest. \"Banking entity\" includes an insured depository institution, any company controlling an insured depository institution, and such a company's affiliates and subsidiaries. Also, it must comply with the Act within two years of its passing, although it may apply for time extensions. Responding to the Volcker Rule and anticipating of its ultimate impact, several commercial banks and investment banks operating as bank holding companies have already begun downsizing or disposing their proprietary trading desks.\n\nThe rule distinguishes transactions by banking entities from transactions by nonbank financial companies supervised by the Federal Reserve Board. The rule states that generally, \"an insured depository institution may not purchase an asset from, or sell an asset to, an executive officer, director, or principal shareholder of the insured depository institution, or any related interest of such person ... unless— the transaction is on market terms; and if the transaction represents more than 10 percent of the capital stock and surplus of the insured depository institution, the transaction has been approved in advance by a majority of the members of the board of directors of the insured depository institution who do not have an interest in the transaction.\" Providing for the regulation of capital, the Volcker Rule says that regulators are required to impose upon institutions capital requirements that are \"countercyclical, so that the amount of capital required to be maintained by a company increases in times of economic expansion and decreases in times of economic contraction\", to ensure the safety and soundness of the organization. The rule also provides that an insured state bank may engage in a derivative transaction only if the law with respect to lending limits of the state in which the insured state bank is chartered takes into consideration credit exposure to derivative transactions. The title provides for a three-year moratorium on approving FDIC deposit insurance received after November 23, 2009, for an industrial bank, a credit card bank, or a trust bank either directly or indirectly owned or controlled by a commercial firm.\n\nIn accordance with section 1075 of the law, payment card networks must allow merchants to establish a minimum dollar amount for customers using payment cards, as long as the minimum is no higher than $10.\n\nThe Volcker Rule was first publicly endorsed by President Obama on January 21, 2010. The final version of the Act prepared by the conference committee included a strengthened Volcker rule by containing language by Senators Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, and Carl Levin, D-Michigan, covering a greater range of proprietary trading than originally proposed by the administration, expect notably for trading in U.S. government securities and bonds issued by government-backed entities. The rule also bans conflict of interest trading. The rule seeks to ensure that banking organizations are both well capitalized and well managed. The proposed draft form of the Volcker Rule was presented by regulators for public comment on October 11, 2011, with the rule due to go into effect on July 21, 2012.\n\nTitle VII, also called the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010, concerns regulation of over the counter swaps markets. This section includes the credit default swaps and credit derivative that were the subject of several bank failures c. 2007. Financial instruments have the means given the terms in section 1a of the Commodity Exchange Act (). On a broader level, the Act requires that various derivatives known as swaps, which are traded over the counter, must be cleared through either exchanges or clearinghouses.\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) both regulate derivatives known as swaps under the Act, but the SEC has authority over \"security-based swaps\". The Act repeals exemption from regulation for security-based swaps under the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act The regulators are required to consult with each other before implementing any rule-making or issuing orders regarding several different types of security swaps. The CFTC and SEC, consultating with the Federal Reserve, are charged with further defining swap related terms that appear in Commodity Exchange Act () and section 3(a)(78) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ().\n\nThe title provides that, \"Except as provided otherwise, no Federal assistance may be provided to any swaps entity with respect to any swap, security-based swap, or other activity of the swaps entity.\" An \"Interagency Group\" is constituted to handle the oversight of existing and prospective carbon markets to ensure an efficient, secure, and transparent carbon market, including oversight of spot markets and derivative markets.\n\nTitle VIII, called the \"Payment, Clearing, and Settlement Supervision Act of 2010\", aims to mitigate systemic risk within and promote stability in the financial system by tasking the Federal Reserve to create uniform standards for the management of risks by systemically important financial organizations and institutions by providing the Fed with an \"enhanced role in the supervision of risk management standards for systemically important financial market utilities; strengthening the liquidity of systemically important financial market utilities; and providing the Board of Governors an enhanced role in the supervision of risk management standards for systemically important payment, clearing, and settlement activities by financial institutions.\"\n\nTitle IX, sections 901 to 991, known as the \"Investor Protections and Improvements to the Regulation of Securities\", revises the Securities and Exchange Commission's powers and structure, as well as credit rating organizations and the relationships between customers and broker-dealers or investment advisers. This title calls for various studies and reports from the SEC and Government Accountability Office (GAO). This title contains ten subtitles, lettered A through J.\n\nSubtitle A contains provisions:\n\nSubtitle A provides authority for the SEC to impose regulations requiring \"fiduciary duty\" by broker-dealers to their customers. Although the Act does not create such a duty immediately, it does authorize the SEC to establish a standard. It also requires the SEC to study the standards of care that broker-dealers and investment advisers apply to their customers and to report to Congress on the results within 6 months. Under the law, commission and limited product range would not violate the duty and broker-dealers would not have a continuing duty after receiving the investment advice.\n\nSubtitle B gives the SEC further powers of enforcement, including a \"whistleblower bounty program\" which is partially based upon the successful \"qui tam\" provisions of the 1986 Amendments to the False Claims Act as well as an IRS whistleblower reward program Congress created in 2006. The SEC program rewards individuals providing information resulting in an SEC enforcement action in which more than $1 million in sanctions is ordered. Whistleblower rewards range from 10-30% of the recovery. The law also provides job protections for SEC whistleblowers and promises confidentiality for them.\n\nSection 921I controversially limited FOIA's applicability to the SEC, a change partially repealed a few months later. The SEC had previously used a narrower existing exemption for trade secrets when refusing Freedom of Information Requests.\n\nRecognizing credit ratings that credit rating agencies had issued, including nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSROs), are matters of national public interest, that credit rating agencies are critical \"gatekeepers\" in the debt market central to capital formation, investor confidence, and the efficient performance of the United States economy, Congress expanded regulation of credit rating agencies.\n\nSubtitle C cites findings of conflicts of interest and inaccuracies during the recent financial crisis contributed significantly to the mismanagement of risks by financial institutions and investors, which in turn adversely impacted the US economy as factors necessitating increased accountability and transparency by credit rating agencies.\n\nSubtitle C mandates the creation by the SEC of an Office of Credit Ratings (OCR) to provide oversight over NRSROs and enhanced regulation of such entities.\n\nEnhanced regulations of nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSROs) include:\n\nSubtitle C grants the Commission some authority to either temporarily suspend or permanently revoke the registration of an NRSRO respecting a particular class or subclass of securities if after noticing and hearing that the NRSRO lacks the resources to produce credit ratings with integrity. Additional key provisions of the Act are:\n\nMoreover, Subtitle C requires the SEC to conduct a study on strengthening the NRSRO's independence, and it recommends the organization to utilize its rulemaking authority to establish guidelines preventing improper conflicts of interest arising from the performance of services unrelated to the issuance of credit ratings such as consulting, advisory, and other services. The Act requires the Comptroller General of the United States to conduct a study on alternative business models for compensating NRSROs\n\nIn Subtitle D, the term \"Asset-Backed Security\" is defined as a fixed-income or other security collateralized by any self-liquidating financial asset, such as a loan, lease, mortgage, allowing the owner of the Asset-Backed Security to receive payments depending on the cash flow of the (ex.) loan. For regulation purposes, Asset-Backed Securities include (but are not limited to):\n\nThe law required credit risk retention regulations (where 5% of the risk was retained) within nine months of enactment. Proposals had been highly criticized due to restrictive definitions on \"qualified residential mortgages\" with restrictive down-payment and debt-to-income requirements. In the August 2013 proposal, the 20% down-payment requirement was dropped. In October 2014, six federal agencies (Fed, OCC, FDIC, SEC, FHFA, and HUD) finalized their joint asset-backed securities rule.\n\nRegulations for assets that are:\n\nSpecifically, securitizers are:\n\nThe regulations are to prescribe several asset classes with separate rules for securitizers, including (but are not limited to) residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, commercial loans, and auto loans. Both the SEC and the federal banking agencies may jointly issue exemptions, exceptions, and adjustments to the rules issues provided that they:\nAdditionally, the following institutions and programs are exempt:\n\nThe SEC may classify issuers and prescribe requirements appropriate for each class of issuers of asset-backed securities. The SEC must also adopt regulations requiring each issuer of an asset-backed security to disclose, for each tranche or class of security, information that will help identify each asset backing that security. Within six months of enactment, the SEC must issue regulations prescribing representations and warranties in the marketing of asset-backed securities:\n\nThe SEC shall also prescribe a Due Diligence analysis/review of the assets underlying the security, and a disclosure of that analysis.\n\nWithin one year of enactment, the SEC must issue rules directing the national securities exchanges and associations to prohibit the listing of any security of an issuer not in compliance of the requirements of the compensation sections. At least once every three years, a public corporation is required to submit the approval of executive compensation to a shareholder vote. And once every six years, there should be a submitted to shareholder vote whether the required approval of executive compensation should be usually that once every three years. Shareholders may disapprove any Golden Parachute compensation to executives via a non-binding vote. Shareholders must be informed of the relationship between executive compensation actually paid and the financial performance of the issuer, taking into account any change in the value of the shares of stock and dividends of the issuer and any distributions as well as:\n\nThe company must also disclose to shareholders whether any employee or member of the board of directors is permitted to purchase financial instruments designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of equity securities that are part of a compensation package. Members of the Board of Director's Compensation Committee have to be independent in the board of directors, a compensation consultant or legal counsel, as provided by rules issued by the SEC. Within 9 months of enacting this legislation, federal regulators shall proscribe regulations that a covered company must disclose to the appropriate Federal regulator, all incentive-based compensation arrangements with sufficient information such that the regulator may determine:\n\nSubtitle F contains various managerial changes intended to increase and implement the agency's efficiency, including reports on internal controls, a triennial report on personnel management by the head of the GAO (the Comptroller General of the United States), a hotline for employees to report problems in the agency, a report by the GAO on the oversight of National Securities Associations, and a report by a consultant on reform of the SEC. Under Subtitle J, the SEC will be funded through \"match funding\", which will in effect mean that its budget will be funded through filing fees.\n\nSubtitle G provides the SEC to issue rules and regulations including a requirement permitting a shareholder to use a company's proxy solicitation materials for nominating individuals to membership on the board of directors. The company is also required to inform investors regarding why the same person is to serve as the board of directors' chairman and its chief executive officer (CEO), or the reason that different individuals must serve as the board's chairman or CEO.\n\nThis provision of the statute creates a guarantee of trust correlating a municipal advisor (who provide advice to state and local governments regarding investments) with any municipal bodies providing services. Also, it alters the make-up of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (\"MSRB\") and mandates that the Comptroller General conducts studies in relation to municipal disclosure and municipal markets. The new MSRB will be composed of fifteen individuals. Also, it will have the authority to regulate municipal advisors and will be permitted to charge fees regarding trade information. Furthermore, it is mandated that the Comptroller General makes several recommendations, which must be submitted to Congress within 24 months of enacting the law.\n\nSubtitle I is concerned with establishing a Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (or PCAOB). The PCAOB has the authority to establish oversight of certified public accounting firms. Its provision allows the SEC to authorize necessary rules respecting securities for borrowing. The SEC shall, as deemed appropriate, exercise transparency within this sector of the financial industry. A council of Inspectors General On Financial Oversight, composed of several members of federal agencies (such as the United States Department of the Treasury, the FDIC, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency) will be established. The council will more easily allow the sharing of data with inspectors general (which includes members by proxy or in person from the SEC and CFTC) with a focus on dealings that may be applicable to the general financial sector largely focusing on the financial oversight's improvement.\n\nSubtitle J provides adjustments to Section 31 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 regarding the \"Recovery Cost of Annual Appropriation\", the \"Registration of Fees\" and the \"Authorization of Appropriations\" provisions of the Act.\n\nTitle X, or the \"Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010\", establishes the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. The new Bureau regulates consumer financial products and services in compliance with federal law. The Bureau is headed by a director appointed by the President, with advice and consent from the Senate, for five-year term. The Bureau is subject to financial audit by the GAO, and must report to the Senate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee bi-annually. The Financial Stability Oversight Council may issue a \"stay\" to the Bureau with an appealable 2/3 of the vote. The Bureau is not placed within the Fed, but it operates independently. The Fed is prohibited from interfering with matters before the Director, directing any employee of the Bureau, modifying the Bureau's functions and responsibilities or impeding an order of the Bureau. The Bureau is separated into six divisions:\n\nWithin the Bureau, a new Consumer Advisory Board assists the Bureau and informs it of emerging market trends. This Board is appointed by the Bureau's Director, with at least six members recommended by regional Fed Presidents. Elizabeth Warren was the first appointee of the President as an adviser to get the Bureau operating. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau can be found on the web.\n\nThe Bureau was formally established when Dodd–Frank was enacted, on July 21, 2010. After a one-year \"stand up\" period, the Bureau obtained enforcement authority and began most activities on July 21, 2011.\n\nThe Durbin Amendment targeting interchange fees is also in Title X, under Subtitle G, section 1075.\n\nA new position is created on the Board of Governors, the \"Vice Chairman for Supervision\", to advise the Board in several areas and:\n\nAdditionally, the GAO is now required to perform several different audits of the Fed:\n\nThe Fed is required to establish prudent standards for the institutions they supervise that include:\nThe Fed may establish additional standards that include, but are not limited to:\nThe Fed may require supervised companies to \"maintain a minimum amount of contingent capital that is convertible to equity in times of financial stress\".\n\nTitle XI requires companies supervised by the Fed to periodically provide additional plans and reports, including:\"\n\nThe title requires that in determining capital requirements for regulated organizations, off-balance-sheet activities shall be taken into consideration, being those things that create an accounting liability such as, but not limited to:\"\n\nTitle XII, known as the \"Improving Access to Mainstream Financial Institutions Act of 2010\", provides incentives that encourage low- and medium-income people to participate in the financial systems. Organizations that are eligible to provide these incentives are 501(c)(3) and tax exempt organizations, federally insured depository institutions, community development financial institutions, State, local or tribal governments. Multi-year programs for grants, cooperative agreements, etc. are also available.\n\nTitle XIII, or the \"Pay It Back Act\", amends the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 to limit the Troubled Asset Relief Program, by reducing the funds available by $225 billion (from $700 billion to $475 billion) and further mandating that unused funds cannot be used for any new programs.\n\nAmendments to the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 and other sections of the federal code to specify that any proceeds from the sale of securities purchased to help stabilize the financial system shall be:\nThe same conditions apply for any funds not used by the state under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 by December 31, 2012, provided that the President may waive these requirements if it is determined to be in the best interest of the nation.\n\nTitle XIV, or the \"Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act\", whose subtitles A, B, C, and E are designated as Enumerated Consumer Law, which will be administered by the new Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. The section focuses on standardizing data collection for underwriting and imposes obligations on mortgage originators to only lend to borrowers who are likely to repay their loans.\n\nA \"Residential Mortgage Originator\" is defined as any person who either receives compensation for or represents to the public that they will take a residential loan application, assist a consumer in obtaining a loan, or negotiate terms for a loan. A residential Mortgage Originator is not a person who provides financing to an individual for the purchase of 3 or less properties in a year, or a licensed real estate broker/associate. All Mortgage Originators are to include on all loan documents any unique identifier of the mortgage originator provided by the Registry described in the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008\n\nFor any residential mortgage loan, no mortgage originator may receive compensation that varies based on the term of the loan, other than the principal amount. In general, the mortgage originator can only receive payment from the consumer, except as provided in rules that may be established by the Board. Additionally, the mortgage originator must verify the consumer's ability to pay. A violation of the \"ability to repay\" standard, or a mortgage that has excessive fees or abusive terms, may be raised as a foreclosure defense by a borrower against a lender without regard to any statute of limitations. The Act bans the payment of yield spread premiums or other originator compensation that is based on the interest rate or other terms of the loans.\n\nIn effect, this section of the Act establishes national underwriting standards for residential loans. It is not the intent of this section to establish rules or regulations that would require a loan to be made that would not be regarded as acceptable or prudential by the appropriate regulator of the financial institution. However, the loan originator shall make a reasonable and good faith effort based on verified and documented information that \"at the time the loan is consummated, the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the loan, according to the terms, and all applicable taxes, insurance (including mortgage guarantee insurance), and other assessments\". Also included in these calculations should be any payments for a second mortgage or other subordinate loans. Income verification is mandated for residential mortgages. Certain loan provisions, including prepayment penalties on some loans, and mandatory arbitration on all residential loans, are prohibited.\n\nThis section also defined a \"Qualified Mortgage\" as any residential mortgage loan that the regular periodic payments for the loan does not increase the principal balance or allow the consumer to defer repayment of principal (with some exceptions), and has points and fees being less than 3% of the loan amount. The Qualified Mortgage terms are important to the extent that the loan terms plus an \"Ability to Pay\" presumption create a safe harbor situation concerning certain technical provisions related to foreclosure.\n\nA \"High-Cost Mortgage\" as well as a reverse mortgage are sometimes referred to as \"certain home mortgage transactions\" in the Fed's Regulation Z (the regulation used to implement various sections of the Truth in Lending Act) High-Cost Mortgage is redefined as a \"consumer credit transaction that is secured by the consumer's principal dwelling\" (excluding reverse mortgages that are covered in separate sections), which include:\nNew provisions for calculating adjustable rates as well as definitions for points and fees are also included.\n\nWhen receiving a High-Cost mortgage, the consumer must obtain pre-loan counseling from a certified counselor. The Act also stipulates there are additional \"Requirements to Existing Residential Mortgages\". The changes to existing contracts are:\n\nSubtitle D, known as the Expand and Preserve Home Ownership Through Counseling Act, creates a new Office of Housing Counseling, within the department of Housing and Urban Development. The director reports to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. The Director shall have primary responsibility within the Department for consumer oriented homeownership and rental housing counseling. To advise the Director, the Secretary shall appoint an advisory committee of not more than 12 individuals, equally representing mortgage and real estate industries, and including consumers and housing counseling agencies. Council members are appointed to 3-year terms. This department will coordinate media efforts to educate the general public in home ownership and home finance topics.\n\nThe Secretary of Housing and Urban Development is authorized to provide grants to HUD-approved housing counseling agencies and state Housing Finance Agencies to provide education assistance to various groups in home ownership. The Secretary is also instructed, in consultation with other federal agencies responsible for financial and banking regulation, to establish a database to track foreclosures and defaults on mortgage loans for 1 through 4 unit residential properties.\n\nSubtitle E concerns jumbo rules concerning escrow and settlement procedures for people who are in trouble repaying their mortgages, and also makes amendments to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974. In general, in connection with a residential mortgage there should be an established escrow or impound account for the payment of taxes, hazard insurance, and (if applicable) flood insurance, mortgage insurance, ground rents, and any other required periodic payments. Lender shall disclose to borrower at least three business days before closing the specifics of the amount required to be in the escrow account and the subsequent uses of the funds. If an escrow, impound, or trust account is not established, or the consumer chooses to close the account, the servicer shall provide a timely and clearly written disclosure to the consumer that advises the consumer of the responsibilities of the consumer and implications for the consumer in the absence of any such account. The amendments to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (or RESPA) change how a Mortgage servicer (those who administer loans held by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, etc.) should interact with consumers.\n\nA creditor may not extend credit for a higher-risk mortgage to a consumer without first obtaining a written appraisal of the property with the following components:\n\nA \"certified or licensed appraiser\" is defined as someone who:\n\nThe Fed, Comptroller of the Currency, FDIC, National Credit Union Administration Board, Federal Housing Finance Agency and Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (created in this law) shall jointly prescribe regulations.\n\nThe use of Automated Valuation Models to be used to estimate collateral value for mortgage lending purposes.\n\nAutomated valuation models shall adhere to quality control standards designed to,\n\nThe Fed, the Comptroller of the Currency, the FDIC, the National Credit Union Administration Board, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, in consultation with the staff of the Appraisal Subcommittee and the Appraisal Standards Board of The Appraisal Foundation, shall promulgate regulations to implement the quality control standards required under this section that devises Automated Valuation Models.\n\nResidential and 1-to-4 unit single family residential real estate are enforced by: Federal Trade Commission, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, and a state attorney general. Commercial enforcement is by the Financial regulatory agency that supervised the financial institution originating the loan.\n\nBroker Price Opinions may not be used as the primary basis to determine the value of a consumer's principal dwelling; but valuation generated by an automated valuation model is not considered a Broker Price Opinion.\n\nThe standard settlement form (commonly known as the HUD 1) may include, in the case of an appraisal coordinated by an appraisal management company, a clear disclosure of:\n\nWithin one year, the Government Accountability Office shall conduct a study on the effectiveness and impact of various appraisal methods, valuation models and distribution channels, and on the home valuation code of conduct and the appraisal subcommittee.\n\nThe Secretary of Housing and Urban Development is charged with developing a program to ensure protection of current and future tenants and at-risk multifamily (5 or more units) properties. The Secretary may coordinate the program development with the Secretary of the Treasury, the FDIC, the Fed, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and any other federal government agency deemed appropriate. The criteria may include:\n\nPreviously the Treasury Department has created the Home Affordable Modification Program, set up to help eligible home owners with loan modifications on their home mortgage debt. This section requires every mortgage servicer participating in the program and denies a re-modification request to provide the borrower with any data used in a net present value (NPV) analysis. The Secretary of the Treasury is also directed to establish a Web-based site that explains NPV calculations.\n\nThe Secretary of the Treasury is instructed to develop a Web-based site to explain the Home Affordable Modification Program and associated programs, that also provides an evaluation of the impact of the program on home loan modifications.\n\n\nThe following sections have been added to the Act:\n\nThe US Executive Director at the International Monetary Fund is instructed to evaluate any loan to a country if\n\n\nRequires the SEC to report on mine safety by gathering information on violations of health or safety standards, citations and orders issued to mine operators, number of flagrant violations, value of fines, number of mining-related fatalities, etc., to determine whether there is a pattern of violations.\n\nThe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended to require disclosure of payments relating to the acquisition of licenses for exploration, production, etc., where \"payment\" includes fees, production entitlements, bonuses, and other material benefits. The act states in SEC. 1504 (3) that these documents will be made available online to the public.\n\nThe Comptroller General is commissioned to assess the relative independence, effectiveness, and expertise of presidentially appointed inspectors general and inspectors general of federal entities.\n\nThe FDIC is instructed to conduct a study to evaluate:\n\nA Section 1256 Contract refers to a section of the that described tax treatment for any regulated futures contract, foreign currency contract or non-equity option. To calculate capital gains or losses, these trades have traditionally been marked to market on the last business day of the year. A \"section 1256 contract\" shall not include:\n\nSenator Chris Dodd, who co-proposed the legislation, has classified the legislation as \"sweeping, bold, comprehensive, [and] long overdue\". In regards to the Fed and what he regarded as their failure to protect consumers, Dodd voiced his opinion that \"[...] I really want the Federal Reserve to get back to its core enterprises [...] We saw over the last number of years when they took on consumer protection responsibilities and the regulation of bank holding companies, it was an abysmal failure. So the idea that we're going to go back and expand those roles and functions at the expense of the vitality of the core functions that they're designed to perform is going in the wrong way.\" However, Dodd pointed out that the transfer of powers from the Fed to other agencies should not be construed as criticism of Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, but rather that \"[i]t's about putting together an architecture that works\".\n\nWith regards to the lack of bipartisan input on the legislation, Dodd alleged that had he put together a \"[...] bipartisan compromise, I think you make a huge mistake by doing that. You're given very few moments in history to make this kind of a difference, and we're trying to do that.\" Put another way, Dodd construed the lack of Republican amendments as a sign \"[...] that the bill is a strong one\".\n\nRichard Shelby, the top-ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee and the one who proposed the changes to the Fed governance, voiced his reasons for why he felt the changes needed to be made: \"It's an obvious conflict of interest [...] It's basically a case where the banks are choosing or having a big voice in choosing their regulator. It's unheard of.\" Democratic Senator Jack Reed agreed, saying \"The whole governance and operation of the Federal Reserve has to be reviewed and should be reviewed. I don't think we can just assume, you know, business as usual.\"\n\nBarney Frank, who in 2003 told auditors warning him of the risk caused by government subsidies in the mortgage market, \"I want to roll the dice a little bit more in this situation toward subsidized housing\" proposed his own legislative package of financial reforms in the House, did not comment on the Stability Act directly, but rather indicated that he was pleased that reform efforts were happening at all – \"Obviously the bills aren't going to be identical, but it confirms that we are moving in the same direction and reaffirms my confidence that we are going to be able to get an appropriate, effective reform package passed very soon.\"\n\nDuring a Senate Republican press conference on April 21, 2010, Richard Shelby reported that he and Dodd were meeting \"every day\", and were attempting to forge a bipartisan bill. Shelby also expressed his optimism that a \"good bill\" will be reached, and that \"we're closer than ever\". Saxby Chambliss echoed Shelby's sentiments, saying \"I feel exactly as Senator Shelby does about the Banking Committee negotiations.\", but voiced his concern about maintaining an active derivatives market and not driving financial firms overseas. Kay Bailey Hutchison indicated her desire to see state banks have access to the Fed, while Orrin Hatch had concerns over transparency, and the lack of Fannie and Freddy reform.\n\nEd Yingling, president of the American Bankers Association, regarded the reforms as haphazard and dangerous, saying \"To some degree, it looks like they're just blowing up everything for the sake of change [...] [i]f this were to happen, the regulatory system would be in chaos for years. You have to look at the real-world impact of this.\"\n\nThe Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) — the \"top Wall Street lobby\" — has expressed support for the law, and has urged Congress not to change or repeal it in order to prevent a stronger law from passing.\n\nA survey by RIMES of senior investment banking figures in the US and UK showed that 86% expect that Dodd–Frank will significantly increase the cost of their data operations.\n\nContinental European scholars have also discussed the necessity of far-reaching banking reforms in light of the current crisis of confidence, recommending the adoption of binding regulations that would go further than Dodd–Frank—notably in France where SFAF and banking experts have argued that, beyond national legislations, such rules should be adopted and implemented within the broader context of separation of powers in European Union law. This perspective has gained ground after the unraveling of the Libor scandal in July 2012, with mainstream opinion leaders such as the Financial Times editorialists calling for the adoption of an EU-wide \"Glass Steagall II\".\n\nAn editorial in the Wall Street Journal speculated that the law would make it more expensive for startups to raise capital and create new jobs; other opinion pieces suggest that such an impact would be due to a reduction in fraud or other misconduct.\n\nThe Dodd–Frank Act has several provisions that call upon the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to implement several new rules and regulations that will affect corporate governance issues surrounding public corporations in the United States. Many of the provisions put in place by Dodd–Frank require the SEC to implement new regulations, but intentionally do not give specifics as to when regulations should be adopted or exactly what the regulations should be. This will allow the SEC to implement new regulations over several years and make adjustments as it analyzes the environment. Public companies will have to work to adopt new policies in order to adapt to the changing regulatory environment they will face over the coming years.\n\nSection 951 of Dodd–Frank deals with executive compensation. The provisions require the SEC to implement rules that require proxy statements for shareholder meetings to include a vote for shareholders to approve executive compensation by voting on \"say on pay\" and \"golden parachutes.\" SEC regulations require that at least once every three years shareholders have a non-binding say-on-pay vote on executive compensation. While shareholder are required to have a say-on-pay vote at least every three years, they can also elect to vote annually, every two years, or every third year. The regulations also require that shareholders have a vote at least every six years to decide how often they would like to have say-on-pay votes. In addition, companies are required to disclose any golden parachute compensation that may be paid out to executives in the case of a merger, acquisition, or sale of major assets. Proxy statements must also give shareholders the chance to cast a non-binding vote to approve golden parachute policies. Although these votes are non-binding and do not take precedence over the decisions of the board, failure to give the results of votes due consideration can cause negative shareholder reactions. Regulations covering these requirements were implemented in January 2011 and took effect in April 2011.\n\nSection 952 of Dodd–Frank deals with independent compensation committees as well as their advisors and legal teams. These provisions require the SEC to make national stock exchanges set standards for the compensation committees of publicly traded companies listed on these exchanges. Under these standards national stock exchanges are prohibited from listing public companies that do not have an independent compensation committee. To insure that compensation committees remain independent, the SEC is required to identify any areas that may create a potential conflict of interest and work to define exactly what requirements must be met for the committee to be considered independent. Some of the areas examined for conflicts of interest include other services provided by advisors, personal relationships between advisors and shareholders, advisor fees as a percentage of their company's revenue, and advisors' stock holdings. These provisions also cover advisors and legal teams serving compensation committees by requiring proxy statements to disclose any compensation consultants and include a review of each to ensure no conflicts of interest exist. Compensation committees are fully responsible for selecting advisors and determining their compensation. Final regulations covering issues surrounding compensation committees were implemented in June 2012 by the SEC and took effect in July 2012. Under these regulations the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ also added their own rules regarding the retention of committee advisors. These regulations were approved by the SEC in 2013 and took full effect in early 2014.\n\nSection 953 of Dodd–Frank deals with pay for performance policies to determine executive compensation. Provisions from this section require the SEC to make regulations regarding the disclosure of executive compensation as well as regulations on how executive compensation is determined. New regulations require that compensation paid to executives be directly linked to financial performance including consideration of any changes in the value of the company's stock price or value of dividends paid out. The compensation of executives and the financial performance justifying it are both required to be disclosed. In addition, regulations require that CEO compensation be disclosed alongside the median employee compensation excluding CEO compensation, along with ratios comparing levels of compensation between the two. Regulations regarding pay for performance were proposed by the SEC in September 2013 and were adopted in August 2015.\n\nSection 954 of Dodd–Frank deals with clawback of compensation policies, which work to ensure that executives do not profit from inaccurate financial reporting. These provisions require the SEC to create regulations that must be adopted by national stock exchanges, which in turn require publicly traded companies who wish to be listed on the exchange to have clawback policies. These policies require executives to return inappropriately awarded compensation, as set forth in section 953 regarding pay for performance, in the case of an accounting restatement due to noncompliance with reporting requirements. If an accounting restatement is made then the company must recover any compensation paid to current or former executives associated with the company the three years prior to the restatement. The SEC proposed regulations dealing with clawback of compensation in July 2015.\n\nSection 955 of Dodd–Frank deals with employees' and directors' hedging practices. These provisions stipulate that the SEC must implement rules requiring public companies to disclose in proxy statements whether or not employees and directors of the company are permitted to hold a short position on any equity shares of the company. This applies to both employees and directors who are compensated with company stock as well as those who are simply owners of company stock. The SEC proposed rules regarding hedging in February 2015.\n\nSection 957 deals with broker voting and relates to section 951 dealing with executive compensation. While section 951 requires say on pay and golden parachute votes from shareholders, section 957 requires national exchanges to prohibit brokers from voting on executive compensation. In addition, the provisions in this section prevent brokers from voting on any major corporate governance issue as determined by the SEC including the election of board members. This gives shareholders more influence on important issues since brokers tend to vote shares in favor of executives. Brokers may only vote shares if they are directly instructed to do so by shareholders associated with the shares. The SEC approved the listing rules set forth by the NYSE and NASDAQ regarding provisions from section 957 in September 2010.\n\nAdditional provisions set forth by Dodd–Frank in section 972 require public companies to disclose in proxy statements reasons for why the current CEO and chairman of the board hold their positions. The same rule applies to new appointments for CEO or chairman of the board. Public companies must find reasons supporting their decisions to retain an existing chairman of the board or CEO or reasons for selecting new ones to keep shareholders informed.\n\nProvisions from Dodd–Frank found in section 922 also address whistle blower protection. Under new regulations any whistle blowers who voluntarily expose inappropriate behavior in public corporations can be rewarded with substantial compensation and will have their jobs protected. Regulations entitle whistle blowers to between ten and thirty percent of any monetary sanctions put on the corporation above one million dollars. These provisions also enact anti-retaliation rules that entitle whistle blowers the right to have a jury trial if they feel they have been wrongfully terminated as a result of whistle blowing. If the jury finds that whistle blowers have been wrongfully terminated, then they must be reinstated to their positions and receive compensation for any back-pay and legal fees. This rule also applies to any private subsidiaries of public corporations. The SEC put these regulations in place in May 2011.\n\nSection 971 of Dodd–Frank deals with proxy access and shareholders' ability to nominate candidates for director positions in public companies. Provisions in the section allow shareholders to use proxy materials to contact and form groups with other shareholders in order to nominate new potential directors. In the past, activist investors had to pay to have materials prepared and mailed to other investors in order to solicit their help on issues. Any shareholder group that has held at least three percent of voting shares for a period of at least three years is entitled to make director nominations. However, shareholder groups may not nominate more than twenty five percent of a company's board and may always nominate at least one member even if that one nomination would represent over twenty five percent of the board. If multiple shareholder groups make nominations then the nominations from groups with the most voting power will be considered first with additional nominations being considered up to the twenty five percent cap.\n\nOn July 12, 2012, the Competitive Enterprise Institute joined the State National Bank of Big Spring, Texas, and the 60 Plus Association as plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, challenging the constitutionality of provisions of Dodd–Frank. The complaint asked the court to invalidate the law, arguing that it gives the federal government unprecedented, unchecked power. The lawsuit was amended on September 20, 2012, to include the states of Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Michigan as plaintiffs. The states asked the court to review the constitutionality of the Orderly Liquidation Authority established under Title II of Dodd–Frank.\n\nIn February 2013 Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt announced that Kansas along with Alabama, Georgia, Ohio, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Michigan, Montana, South Carolina, Texas and West Virginia would join the lawsuit. The second amended complaint included those new states as plaintiffs.\n\nOn August 1, 2013, U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle dismissed the lawsuit for lack of standing. In July 2015, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that the bank, but not the states that later joined the lawsuit, had standing to challenge the law, and returned the case to Huvelle for further proceedings.\n\nOn April 21, 2010, the CBO released a cost-estimate of enacting the legislation. In its introduction, the CBO briefly discussed the legislation and then went on to generally state that it is unable to assess the cost of financial crises under current law, and added that estimating the cost of similar crises under this legislation (or other proposed ideas) is equally (and inherently) difficult: \"[...] CBO has not determined whether the estimated costs under the Act would be smaller or larger than the costs of alternative approaches to addressing future financial crises and the risks they pose to the economy as a whole.\"\n\nIn terms of the impact on the federal budget, the CBO estimates that deficits would reduce between 2011–2020, but in part due to the risk-based assessment fees levied to initially capitalize the Orderly Liquidation Fund; after which, the majority of revenue for the fund would be drawn primarily from interest payments. Due to this, the CBO projects that eventually the money being paid into the Fund (in the form of fees) would be exceeded by the expenses of the Fund itself. Additionally, the CBO points out that the reclassification of collected fees by various government agencies has the effect of boosting revenue.\n\nThe cost estimate also raises questions about the time-frame of capitalizing the Fund – their estimate took the projected value of fees collected for the Fund (and interest collected on the Fund) weighed against the expected expense of having to deal with corporate default(s) until 2020. Their conclusion was it would take longer than 10 years to fully capitalize the Fund (at which point they estimated it would be approximately 45 billion), although no specifics beyond that were expressed.\n\nThe projection was a $5 billion or more deficit increase in at least one of the ten-year periods starting in 2021.\n\nAssociated Press reported that in response to the costs that the legislation places on banks, some banks have ended the practice of giving their customers free checking. Small banks have been forced to end some businesses such as mortgages and car loans in response to the new regulations. The size of regulatory compliance teams has grown. The Heritage Foundation, calling attention to the new ability of borrowers to sue lenders for misjudging their ability to repay a loan, predicted that smaller lenders would be forced to exit the mortgage market due to increased risk. One study has shown that smaller banks have been hurt by the regulations of the Dodd–Frank Act. Community banks' share of the US banking assets and lending market fell from over 40% in 1994 to around 20% today, although this is a misleading at best but highly likely inaccurate number considering the Dodd-Frank was implemented 16 years later than 1994. These experts believe that regulatory barriers fall most heavily on small banks, even though legislators intended to target large financial institutions.\n\nComplying with the statute seems to have resulted in job shifting or job creation in the business of fulfilling reporting requirements, while making it more difficult to fire employees who report criminal violations. Opponents of the Dodd–Frank Law believe that it will affect job creation, in a sense that because of stricter regulation unemployment will increase significantly. However, the Office of Management and Budget attempts to \"monetize\" benefits versus costs to prove the contrary. The result is a positive relationship where benefits exceed costs: \"During a 10-year period OMB reviewed 106 major regulations for which cost and benefit data were available [...] $136 billion to $651 billion in annual benefits versus $44 billion to $62 billion in annual costs\" (Shapiro and Irons, 2011, p. 8).\n\nAccording to Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen in August 2017, \"The balance of research suggests that the core reforms we have put in place have substantially boosted resilience without unduly limiting credit availability or economic growth.\"\n\nSome experts have argued that Dodd–Frank does not protect consumers adequately and does not end too big to fail.\n\nLaw professor and bankruptcy expert David Skeel concluded that the law has two major themes: \"government partnership with the largest Wall Street banks and financial institutions\" and \"a system of ad hoc interventions by regulators that are divorced from basic rule-of-law constraints\". While he states that \"the overall pattern of the legislation is disturbing\", he also concludes that some are clearly helpful, such as the derivatives exchanges and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nRegarding the Republican-led rollback of some provisions of Dodd-Frank in 2018, this move from increased regulation after a crisis to deregulation during an economic boom has been a recurrent feature in the United States.\n\nThe SEC's 2017 annual report on the Dodd-Frank whistleblower program stated: \"Since the program’s inception, the SEC has ordered wrongdoers in enforcement matters involving whistleblower information to pay over $975 million in total monetary sanctions, including more than $671 million in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and interest, the majority of which has been...returned to harmed investors.\" Whistleblowers receive 10-30% of this amount under the Act.\n\nThe Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has the mission of protecting consumers in the financial markets. Then-CFPB Director Richard Cordray testified on April 5, 2017 that: \"Over the past five years, we have returned almost $12 billion to 29 million consumers and imposed about $600 million in civil penalties.\" The CFPB publishes a semi-annual report on its activities.\n\nOn March 14, 2018, the US Senate passed the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act exempting dozens of US banks from the Dodd-Frank Act's banking regulations.

She was arrested for murder and fraud, and was sent to trial in one of the most famous cases in the Victorian-era.\n\nEmma Cunningham was a young woman in New York City when she married a widower, George Cunningham in 1835. When he died in 1852 his life insurance policy amounted to $10,000, a tidy sum. As an attractive widow, she met Dr. Harvey Burdell, a prosperous dentist and rented a suite of rooms in his mansion as did other tenants, such as John J. Eckel (later to be accused as an accessory). It was intimated that Cunningham was sexually involved with both of these men.\n\nDr. Burdell resided and practiced dentistry at his townhouse on 31 Bond Street in New York City, one of the most affluent blocks in pre-Civil War New York. This area declined rapidly in the mid-century and only a few traces of the thirty-five Greek Revival homes remain. Burdell, like his neighbors, was very wealthy, although his reputation was far from sterling as he was accused of embezzlement, reneging on debts and causing a scandal on his wedding day by demanding money from the bride's father who was enraged and canceled the wedding.\n\nOn the morning of January 31, 1857, Dr. Burdell's servants discovered his body in his office, at 31 Bond Street, covered with blood, brutally stabbed multiple times and strangled. Upon police interrogation, some of the servants testified that they heard angry words between the victim and his assailant the night before. The police determined that Dr. Burdell had been stabbed at least 15 times by an assailant who was left-handed. Since Emma Cunningham was left-handed, she was an immediate suspect and was arrested for Burdell's murder and imprisoned for trial.\n\nThe trial, at its time, was as notorious as the O.J. Simpson trial was in the 1990s and was accompanied by a media circus akin to such trials today. A reputed 8,000 people tried to cram into the church for the funeral and Cunningham reportedly threw herself dramatically on Burdell's casket.\n\nDuring the first evening of the Coroner's investigation, on January 31, 1857, Mrs. Cunningham produced a certificate of marriage revealing that she and Dr. Burdell had been married on October 28, 1856. This gave the prosecutor a suspected motive for murder, for as wife, she would inherit his fortune. Dr. Burdell's estate was estimated at $100,000, which included the townhouse where he was murdered, and various other real estate. All the members of the household, including servants and Emma Cunningham and her family were placed under house arrest by Coroner Edward Connery, as was custom at the time. After a fourteen-day coroner's investigation, which took place in the parlor of 31 Bond Street, the case was delivered to a grand jury, where Emma Cunningham was indicted for the murder of Dr. Burdell. She was placed in jail awaiting her trial. The top defense attorney, Henry Lauren Clinton, represented Emma Cunningham. The New York City District Attorney, Abraham Oakey Hall was the prosecutor. Hall later became Mayor of New York City in 1869.\n\nAt the murder trial, which began in May 1857, there was much testimony from all sides. Cunningham did not testify. One of Burdell's maids testified that she had called him a bad man who was not fit to live. A man named John Eckels, a boarder at the home of Dr. Burdell, was labeled an accessory to the murder, but testimony to his actions was not heard during Cunningham's trial. Also, all testimony to the marriage certificate was not heard, as its validity was being tested in the Surrogate's Court. Burdell's widely known unsavory reputation made accusation against Cunningham difficult for the prosecutor to make credible. On May 9, 1857, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty and Cunningham was free to go.\n\nAfter Emma Cunningham's acquittal, she was permitted to return to the townhouse on 31 Bond Street, pending a hearing and decision of the Surrogate's Court to determine if in fact her marriage to Dr. Harvey Burdell was valid, and if that entitled her to his house and other property. At the time, marriage was conducted by a clergyman, and witnessed, but was not registered with any office of the state to make it legal and valid. The marriage certificate in question was signed by a clergyman, both parties and two witnesses. The clergyman recalled the event. The only way to invalidate the marriage was to prove that it was an imposter and not Dr. Burdell himself who appeared to be married. The Surrogate's decision on the matter of the marriage and the inheritance was scheduled for August 1857.\n\nPrior to that decision, a scandal erupted involving Emma Cunningham. It was purported by District Attorney Oakey Hall that Cunningham had \"procured\" a baby by paying $1000 to declare a false heir, with the father as Dr. Burdell. This would entitle her to all of Dr. Burdell's fortune, instead of just her widow's share. The prosecutor and chief of police raided her home and removed Cunningham, who was delirious and under the influence of drugs. Also present was a doctor and a baby that had been marked under the arms with acid, as it had been prepared by the district attorney prior to the sting. The \"baby scam\" had been engineered by the district attorney, and the doctor who testified to the events was his close associate, Dr. de la Montagnie, who was also the godfather of Hall's daughter. Emma Cunningham was briefly taken to the Tombs, the New York City jail, where she had already spent two months while awaiting the murder trial. \n\nHer defense attorney, Henry Clinton, had the charges swiftly dismissed based on lack of evidence of a crime, and due to entrapment. Cunningham was again released. To this day it is unclear if the 'baby scam' was fabricated and engineered by the district attorney or if Emma Cunningham was delusional and engaged in the act of attempting to buy an heir. It would be an unlikely move for her to attempt when she was already in line to split a significant fortune with Burdell's relatives. All of the testimony and reportage of her claimed pregnancy was after-the-fact hearsay and never verified as fact. However, the judge in the Surrogate's case was negatively influenced by the incident, and ruled that Emma Cunningham, although acquitted of any wrongdoing, would not inherit any money or property from Burdell's estate.\n\nFrom August 1857 onward, Emma Cunningham was a free woman; however her reputation was forever tainted, as she would always be suspected of being involved in the infamous murder. By the end of that year, she was penniless and eventually moved to the West Coast. She returned to New York City in 1887, where she died at the home of a cousin; she was 69. Her death was reported in the \"New York Times\" on September 18, 1887. \n\nDuring the following century, many of the accounts of the murder repeated the disproved or uncorroborated hearsay that had, at the time of the trial, been eliminated from the court proceedings as hearsay or corrected in the press. Over time, there were several unverified confessions to the murder. The murder was never solved.\n\nIn contrast to the trial of Judith Catchpole in 1636 in which an all-female jury was empaneled to inspect her body and determine if she had been pregnant and given birth, Victorian morality prevented such a direct approach. Without proper medical evidence of her condition, there was not a way to prove during the trial that she was not pregnant.\n\nEmma's story was featured a season 1 episode of \"Monumental Mysteries\". According to the series, Cunningham is buried at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. Her gray-granite tombstone reads, Emma Augusta Hempstead Cunningham 1818-1887 – \"May God Rest Her Troubled Soul\" and depicts a beautiful tree etched into the stone. And in a twist of fate, Burdell's grave is only a hundred yards away from hers. Burdell’s gray-granite tombstone is etched with a weeping willow reads, Harvey Burdell 1811-1857 – \"We humbly beseech thee, O father, to raise us from the life of righteousness; that when we shall depart this life we may rest in him.\"\n\n"}

It may include sustainable energy sources such as solar or geothermal, and be sited to take maximum advantage of natural features such as sunlight and tree cover to improve energy efficiency.\n\nNo government standards define what constitutes a green remodel, beyond non-profit certification. In general, a green home is a house that is built or remodeled in order to conserve \"energy or water; improve indoor air quality; use sustainable, recycled or used materials; and produce less waste in the process.\" This may include buying more energy-efficient appliances or employing building materials that are more efficient in managing temperature.\n\nIn the United States, the green building movement began in the 1970s, after the price of oil began to increase sharply. In response, researchers began to look into more energy efficient systems. Many organizations were founded in the 1990s to promote green buildings. Some organizations worked to improve consumer knowledge so that they could have more green homes. The International Code Council and the National Association of Home Builders began working in 2006 to create a \"voluntary green home building standard\".\n\nThe Energy Policy Act was enacted in 2005, which allowed tax reductions for homeowners who could show the use of energy efficient changes to their homes, such as solar panels and other solar-powered devices.\n\nVarious types of certifications certify a home as a green home. The U.S. Green Building Council is an example of an organization that gives out green home certifications. Its certification is titled as Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design. The factors that it considers include \"the site location, use of energy and water, incorporation of healthier building and insulation materials, recycling, use of renewable energy, and protection of natural resources\".\n\nThe US National Association of Home Builders independently created its Model Green Home Building Guidelines as a type of certification, along with programs for utilities.\n\nThe Indian Green Building Council (IGBC), part of the Confederation of Indian Industry was formed in the year 2001.

Although the case was the third decision on the practice, it was actually the first case brought to the European Court by the Slovak feminist organization Center for Civil and Human Rights already in 2004.\n\nThe case concerned three Romani women - I.G., R.K. and M.K., who were forcibly sterilized in Krompachy Hospital in Eastern Slovakia. Applicants I.G. and M.K were underage minors at the time of the interventions. I.G. was sterilized in 2000, during the delivery of her second child. She was not informed about the intervention at the time and found out about it only three years later, after she examined her medical records in the Hospital. M.K. was sterilized in 1999, also during the delivery of her second child. She and her parents found about the intervention only after it was already performed on her. The applicant R.H. was sterilized in 2002 without her informed consent\n\nSince 2003, all applicants were trying to obtain damages at the Slovak courts, including the Constitutional Court. They also acted as injured parties in the criminal proceedings, led by the Slovak police and prosecutors from 2003 onwards. Only M.K. received compensations from the District Court in Spišská Nová Ves in amount of EUR 1,593. The European Court, however, did not find this compensation adequate in the light of the seriousness of the violations.\n\nThe case was lodged to the European Court already in 2004, claiming violations of several provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights. In its decision from 13 November 2012, the European Court ruled in favor of I.G. and M.K. Since, R.K., died during the course of the proceedings, the European Court did not consider her complaint.\n\nThe European Court declared that the sterilization without informed consent of their legal guardians violated the Slovak legislation valid at the time of the interventions. As such, it violated their right to be free from inhuman and degrading treatment, guaranteed by\nArticle 3 of the Convention. Yet again, the European Court found that Slovakia also violated the positive obligation under Article 8 of the Convention to provide effective protection of reproductive right of Romani women, who are particularly vulnerable group in the population.\n\nImportantly, the decision differs from the previous cases on the matter in the fact that for the first time, the Court also found that the investigation led by the Slovak authorities into the case did not meet the standards of effective investigation guaranteed by the Convention (procedural aspect of Article 3).\n\nApart of the violation of Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention, the Court ordered the Slovak Government to pay the compensations to the applicants in amount of 28,500 EUR and 27,000 EUR respectively and the reimbursement of their legal costs\n\n"}

He is the Director of the recently founded Sydney Democracy Network.\n\nKeane was born in southern Australia and educated at the Universities of Adelaide, Toronto and Cambridge.\n\nIn recent years, he has held the Karl Deutsch Professorship in Berlin, co-directed a European Commission-funded project on the future of civil society and citizenship, and served as a Fellow of the London-based think tank the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR).

Following the protests that took place at the University of Sydney, IHDR reversed its decision on the invitation.\n\nThe term \"monitory democracy\" is introduced in Keane's \"The Life and Death of Democracy\" (2009). It claims that from around 1945 democracy entered a new historical phase. In the age of 'monitory democracy', the language and ideals and institutions of democracy undergo many changes. For the first time in its history, democracy has grown familiar to people living within most regions of the earth, regardless of their language, nationality, religion or civilisation. This process of 'indigenisation' helps explain why, again for the first time, there is an explosion of many different understandings of democracy (for many people, especially in poorer countries, it becomes synonymous with justice, electricity, sanitation and other public goods); and why there are references to 'global democracy' and much talk of democracy as a universal ideal. Democracy becomes globally accepted as the political governing form par excellence. For the first time as well, racial prejudice is said to be incompatible with the ideals of democracy. In contrast to the age of representative democracy, which ended just prior to World War Two, many democrats consequently feel embarrassed or angered by talk of 'naturally inferior', or 'backward' or 'uncivilised' peoples.\n\nIn the age of monitory democracy, less obviously, there are indications that the theory and practice of democracy are mutating, that its significance is changing because its institutions are being stretched into areas of life in which democracy in any form was previously excluded, or played only a limited role. Once seen as the rule of the people, by the people and for the people, democracy is viewed more pragmatically, as a vital weapon for guaranteeing political equality against concentrations of publicly unaccountable power. That is what monitory democracy means: the ongoing public scrutiny and public control of decision makers, whether they operate in the field of government or inter-governmental institutions, or within so-called non-governmental or civil society organisations, such as businesses, trade unions, sports associations and charities.\n\nIn the age of monitory democracy, in contrast to the earlier eras of assembly democracy and representative democracy in territorial state form, many new mechanisms are mixed and combined with new ways of publicly monitoring and controlling the exercise of power. Representative forms of government do not simply wither, or disappear. Elections remain important and representative democracy within the framework of territorial states often survives, and in some countries it even thrives, sometimes (as in Mongolia, Taiwan and South Africa) for the first time ever. Efforts to renew representative government are commonplace, as in the civic involvement and clean-up schemes (\"machizukuri\") in Japanese cities such as Yokohama and Kawasaki during the past several decades. But, for a variety of reasons that are related to Public Pressure and the need to reduce corruption and the abuse of power, conventional representative forms of democracy are coming to be supplemented (and hence complicated) by a variety of democratic innovations that are applied to organisations underneath and beyond governments. Others include public integrity mechanisms, congresses, blogging and other new forms of media scrutiny, as well as cross-border parliaments and open methods of co-ordination, of the kind practised in the European Union. These inventions are unique to the age of monitory democracy, and they fundamentally alter both the political geometry and dynamics of democracy. Democracy becomes nothing less but much more than electoral democracy. According to Keane, although its future is by no means guaranteed, monitory democracy is the most intricate, complex and dynamic form of democracy, a type of post-electoral democracy that has long-term consequences and disorientating effects upon political parties, parliaments, politicians and governments. He concludes that in the age of public monitoring of power, democracy can no longer be seen as a done deal, or as already achieved. Monitory democracy is an unfinished experiment that both thrives on imperfection and requires fresh ways of thinking about democracy's virtues and its imperfections and failures.\n\n"}

The full name of the treaty is Joint Declaration of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Portuguese Republic on the question of Macao. Signed on 26 March, 1987 the Declaration established the process and conditions of the transfer of the territory from Portuguese rule to the People's Republic of China. The Joint Declaration served also as the main source of fundamental rights that were implemented in the Macau Special Administrative Region Basic Law. The process was similar to the transfer of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty by the United Kingdom in 1997.\n\nBy the 17th century, Portugal had established colonial rule over Macau after gaining concessions from various Chinese governments. In 1887, Portugal and the Qing dynasty signed the Sino-Portuguese Draft Minutes and the Sino–Portuguese Treaty of Peking, in which China ceded to Portugal the right to \"perpetual occupation and government of Macau\"; conversely, Portugal pledged to seek China's approval before transferring Macau to another country. Colonial rule continued until 1974, when the Carnation revolution installed a democratic regime in Portugal that sought to end colonialism. Bilateral talks between China and Portugal led to the status of Macau being established as Chinese territory under Portuguese administration. The full framework of transfer of sovereignty was decided in 1987 with the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration.\n\nThe \"Declaração\" provided for Portuguese administration to officially end on 20 December, 1999. Although it would become a full part of the People's Republic of China, Macau would enjoy the status of a Special Administrative Region (SAR), with full autonomy and self-governance in domestic affairs, economic policy and internal security. The system of \"One country, two systems\" would be established, exempting Macau from the Socialist system and several laws decreed by the central government in Beijing. The capitalist, legal system and liberal society enjoyed by Macau would remain unchanged for a minimum of 50 years after the transfer. The Chinese government would not levy taxes on Macau nor make laws pertaining to Macau's governance. The Macau SAR would enjoy a great degree of autonomy in all but foreign affairs and defence, which would remain under Chinese control. Bearing the name of \"Macau, China,\" Macau would enjoy the right to conclude agreements and arrangements with Portugal and international organisations for its own development. The Chinese National People's Congress would enact a \"Basic Law\" that would formalise the respecting of some basic principles of Chinese government in Macau, but leaving other areas untouched.\n\n"}

The judgment summons cites the defendant to appear personally in court, and be examined on oath as to the means he has, or has had, since the date of the order or judgment made against him, to pay the same, and to show cause why he should not be committed to prison for his default. An order of commitment obtained in a judgment summons remains in force for a year only, and the extreme term of imprisonment is six weeks, dating from the time of lodging in prison.\n\nWhen a debtor has once been imprisoned, although for a period of less than six weeks, no second order of commitment can be made against him in respect of the same debt. But if the judgment be for payment by instalments a power of committal arises on default of payment for each instalment.\n\nHowever, if an order of commitment has never been executed, or becomes inoperative through lapse of time, a fresh commitment may be made.\n\nImprisonment does not operate as a satisfaction or extinguishment of a debt, or deprive a person of a right of execution against the land or goods of the person imprisoned in the same manner as there had been no imprisonment. In this regard the judgement summons procedure may be seen as a more extreme—because of the threat of imprisonment—version of the procedure under the Civil Procedure Rules procedure to obtain information from judgment debtors.\n\nA judgment summons may now be served by post in keeping with other Civil Procedure Rules actions but, if this option is chosen, then a commitment order cannot be obtained unless: (a) he appears at the hearing; or (b) it is made under section 110(2) of the Act.\n\nApplications for these are now made under County Court rules Order 28.

The title may or may not be linked to a particular cabinet or ministerial office. This is most often the case today, but in the past the role was often a distinct and important job.\n\nThe official Keeper of the Great Seal of Canada is the Governor General. At his or her installation, the governor general swears three oaths, one of which is the oath of the office of keeper of the great seal. The seal is also presented to the Governor General who entrusts it back to the registrar general for safekeeping. The seal is actually kept with the Registrar General of Canada, a title which since 1995 has been linked to the office of Minister of Industry.\n\nEach province since 1869 has its own seal and their keepers are the provincial Lieutenant Governors. As the Registrar General actually keeps the Great seal of Canada, so the provincial Great Seals are placed by the lieutenant-governors of the provinces into the keeping of the provincial Attorneys-General.\n\nThe French \"Keeper of the Seals\" (\"Garde des Sceaux\") is a title held by the Minister of Justice. Formerly, as Keeper of the Seals of France, this title belonged to the Chancellor, the \"ancien régime\" counterpart of the minister of justice. The title is nowadays often used interchangeably with \"Minister of Justice of France.\"\n\nThe Minister of Justice guards the Great Seal of France, dating from 1848, in his or her office, as well as the stamping press. The Seal was used in 1958 to seal the Constitution of France and has since been used to seal certain constitutional amendments.\n\nIn Italy, the Minister of Justice assumes the duties of Guardasigilli (Keeper of the Seals).\n\nAs \"Guardasigilli\", the Minister of Justice countersigns all laws and decrees signed by the president and the decrees issued by other ministries. The Minister of Justice is also the editor of the \"Gazzetta Ufficiale della Repubblica Italiana\", the official bulletin of the Italian Republic.\n\nIn the Netherlands, custody of the great seal is held ex-officio by the Minister of Justice.\n\nThe Governor-General of New Zealand has custody of the Seal of New Zealand. However, responsibility for the seal is delegated to the Clerk of the Executive Council. The seal is affixed to various instruments that require it.\n\nIn medieval and Renaissance times the Papal \"Piombatore\" (\"Keeper of the Lead\") was an important and well-paid office, always held by a friar. The painter Sebastiano del Piombo held it from 1531 until his death in 1546, and the nickname he is known by came from his job-title. He had to take holy orders for the purpose, despite having a wife and two sons. The position was usually awarded for life, and in the Renaissance was often given to artists who worked on papal projects. The important architect Bramante had been appointed in 1513, but died the next year, when Mariano Fetti succeeded. He was already a friar, and a sort of court jester, but also an intimate friend to the Medici Pope Leo X. He held the role under three popes until his death in 1531, when Sebastiano succeeded him.\n\nSeveral British officials have titles connected to the keeping of seals.\n\n\nThe United States Secretary of State is the official keeper of the Great Seal of the United States, and the seal may only be affixed to instruments as provided by law or by authorization of the President. Unlike the Great Seals listed above, the Great Seal of the United States is the primary graphical emblem of the United States and is used equivalently to a coat of arms.\n\nThe seals of individual U.S. states are typically the responsibility of the State Secretary of State.\n"}

Florida Board of Regents, 528 U.S. 62 (2000), was a United States Supreme Court case that determined that the Congress's enforcement powers under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution did not extend to the abrogation of state sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment where the discrimination complained of was rationally based on age.\n\nEmployees of Florida State University and Florida International University, including J. Daniel Kimel, Jr., sued under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (the ADEA) because failure to adjust pay had a disparate impact on older employees. Wellington Dickson sued his employer, the Florida Department of Corrections, for not promoting him because of his age. Roderick MacPherson and Marvin Narz, who were associate professors at the University of Montevallo in Alabama, sued under the ADEA law alleging an evaluation system that discriminated against the elderly. The cases of Kimel, Dickson, MacPherson and Narz were consolidated on appeal to the Eleventh Circuit, and remained consolidated when the Supreme Court granted certiorari.\n\n\"Kimel\" invalidated the ADEA insofar as it allowed plaintiffs to sue states for money damages.\n\n\"Kimel\" concerned the ability of Congress to override the states' \"sovereign immunity\" using its power under the Fourteenth Amendment. Sovereign immunity is a principle that originally comes from English law and referred to the immunity of the English monarch from suit. Sovereign immunity, according to the Supreme Court in \"Hans v. Louisiana\" (1890), normally prevents a state from being sued by its own citizens in federal court. This bar against suit, the Court said, came from the Eleventh Amendment, even though the express terms of that amendment provide only that citizens of one state cannot sue another state.\n\nIn \"Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer\" (1976), however, the Court made an exception to that usual rule. \"Fitzpatrick\" held that Congress could use its power under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment—which allows Congress to enforce the substantive terms of the Fourteenth Amendment, including the Equal Protection Clause, by positive legislation—to override state sovereign immunity. But in 1997, in \"City of Boerne v. Flores\", the Court limited congressional power to override state sovereign immunity using the Fourteenth Amendment, and for the first time required \"congruence and proportionality\" between the constitutional wrong and the congressionally enacted remedy to protect constitutional rights. \"Boerne\" held that it was the Court, and only the Court, that could determine what constituted a constitutional wrong, and that Congress could not permissibly increase the level of constitutional protection beyond that which the Court had recognized. Specifically, \"Boerne\" interpreted the scope of section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which states, \"The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.\"\n\nThe Court in \"Kimel\" based its decision in large part on \"Boerne\". The importance of \"Kimel\" was the strict limits it placed on the ability of Congress to abrogate the states' sovereign immunity under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nJustice O'Connor, writing for the majority, stated that Congress in enacting the ADEA had properly declared its intent to subject states to suits for money damages by private individuals. The Court then noted that under the Court's equal protection jurisprudence, \"age is not a suspect classification,\" and laws which classify on the basis of age need only pass the Court's \"rational basis review\" test, as opposed to legal classifications based on race or gender, where a \"history of purposeful unequal treatment\" leads the Court to apply strict scrutiny to such laws. The Court then contrasted rational basis review with the ADEA, which prohibits \"all\" employment discrimination on the basis of age, except where age is a \"bona fide occupational qualification.\" The ADEA, the Court concluded, \"prohibits substantially more state employment decisions and practices than would likely be held unconstitutional under the applicable equal protection, rational basis standard.\" Therefore, the ADEA's remedy failed the \"congruence and proportionality\" test required by \"Boerne\" and so was not \"a valid exercise of constitutional authority\" under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nIn explaining the application of rational basis review to classifications based on age, the majority stated:\n\nJustice Stevens's dissenting opinion said, \"There is not a word in the text of the Constitution supporting the Court's conclusion that the judge-made doctrine of sovereign immunity limits Congress' power to authorize private parties, as well as federal agencies, to enforce federal law against the States.\" Justice Stevens referred to the doctrine of sovereign immunity as expanded by \"Seminole Tribe v. Florida\" and \"Alden v. Maine\" as \"judicial activism.\"\n\n"}

Largely modeled on the Constitution of the United States, it remained in effect from its adoption on 26 July 1847 until its suspension by the People's Redemption Council on 12 April 1980.\n\nThe Constitution created a unitary state governed by three branches of government: the executive, legislative and judicial branches. The executive branch was led by the President of Liberia, elected by popular vote of all land-owning citizens to a two-year term. Legislative power was held by the Legislature of Liberia, a bicameral body made up of a House of Representatives and a Senate. The judicial branch consisted of the Supreme Court of Liberia, made up of a chief justice and four associate justices, and circuit courts created by the Legislature. Article One of the Constitution enshrined civil liberties similar to those protected by the Bill of Rights in the United States Constitution.\n\nApproved in a referendum on 27 September 1847, the Constitution was amended several times from 1847 to 1980. Among these amendments, the term length of the president was extended to four years in 1908, and to eight years in 1934.\n"}

In response, opponents began organizing campaigns to place measures on their local ballots to repeal these anti-discrimination laws. The repeal movement found a national spokesperson in Anita Bryant, who helped found—and served as president of—Save Our Children. Save Our Children organized in Florida in 1977 in response to the passage by the Dade County Commission of an anti-discrimination ordinance. Bryant's campaign was successful; the Miami-Dade ordinance was repealed by a greater than two-to-one margin. Repeal campaigns, building on this success, spread nationally and several other ordinances were repealed. In California in 1978, conservative state senator John Briggs sponsored Proposition 6, which would have barred gay and lesbian people from working in a public school. The defeat of this measure, and of an ordinance repeal measure in Seattle, Washington the same day, stalled the momentum of the repeal forces.\n\nThe mid-1980s and early 1990s saw a resurgence in ballot initiatives, culminating in proposed state constitutional amendments in Oregon and Colorado not only to repeal existing anti-discrimination ordinances but to proactively prohibit the state and any local unit of government within the state from ever passing such an ordinance. Oregon's Measure 9, sponsored by the Oregon Citizens Alliance, failed, but Colorado's Amendment 2 passed. Amendment 2 was declared unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court in its 1996 \"Romer v. Evans\" decision. Oregon and two other states, Idaho and Maine, had initiatives between the passage of Amendment 2 and the Court decision; all three were defeated but many municipalities within Oregon passed local measures.\n\nAs the question of same-sex marriage has risen to greater prominence, opponents of such marriages have turned their attention to passing constitutional amendments barring individual states from legalizing same-sex marriages or recognizing such marriages performed in other jurisdictions. These amendments are listed here. Before the marriage issue arose, some jurisdictions had begun providing limited rights and benefits to same-sex domestic partners. These ordinances also became targets of repeal efforts, with repeal supporters meeting with less success.\n\nSince the 2015 US Supreme Court ruling in the case of \"Obergefell v. Hodges\", the prominence of LGBT anti-discrimination laws became the top priority of LGBT rights activists. One of the most controversial, recent, and largest repeal effort was Proposition 1 in Houston, Texas.\n\nThe mid-1980s and early 1990s saw a resurgence in ballot initiatives, culminating in proposed state constitutional amendments in Oregon and Colorado not only to repeal existing anti-discrimination ordinances but to proactively prohibit the state and any local unit of government within the state from ever passing such an ordinance.

Oregon and two other states, Idaho and Maine, had initiatives between the passage of Amendment 2 and the Court decision; all three were defeated but many municipalities within Oregon passed local measures.\n\nAfter failing to pass Measure 9 in 1992, OCA turned its attention to passing anti-discrimination bans at the county and municipal level. Couching the debate in terms of forbidding LGBT people from receiving so-called \"special rights\", OCA sought not only to block ordinances in these communities but to bar them from spending money to \"promote homosexuality\". OCA was successful in passing over two dozen initiatives. However, in 1993 the Oregon Legislative Assembly passed a law prohibiting local governments from considering LGBT rights measures so the ordinances had no legal force. The Oregon Court of Appeals upheld the state law in 1995. Two weeks after the United States Supreme Court ruled in \"Romer\", OCA suspended its efforts for a third statewide ballot initiative.\n\n"}

He served as a judge on the Federal Shariat Court of Pakistan from 1981 to 1982 and the \"Shariat Appellate Bench\" of the Supreme Court of Pakistan between 1982 and 2002. He is an expert in the fields of Islamic Jurisprudence (fiqh), economics, Tasawwuf, and hadith. He also held a number of positions on the Shariah Boards of prestigious Islamic institutions, and was instrumental in the writing of the Hudood Ordinances under General Zia ul-Haq. He is the brother of Islamic scholars Muhammad Rafi Usmani, Muhammad Wali Razi, and Muhammad Razi Usmani, as well as of the Urdu poet Muhammad Zaki Kaifi. He has written translations of the Qur'an in both English and Urdu. He was given the title of Shaykh al-Islām by his teacher Mawlana Sahban Mahmood.\n\nMuhammad Taqi Usmani was born on 5 October 1943 (5 Shawwal 1362 AH) in Deoband, a city in the Saharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh, India.\n\nIn 1958, Usmani passed the Fazil-e-Arabi (Arabic language examination) with distinction, administered by the Punjab Board. In 1959 he graduated from the `Alim course at Darul Uloom Karachi. He then specialised in \"fiqh\" (Islamic jurisprudence) under the guidance of his father, the Mufti of Darul Uloom Karachi, Muhammad Shafi, receiving his \"Takhassus\" degree (equivalent to a PhD) in \"fiqh\" and \"ifta\" (issuance of Islamic legal opinions) from Darul Uloom Karachi in 1961, earning the title of \"Mufti\". He graduated from the University of Karachi with a Bachelor of Arts in 1964, then received a Bachelor of Laws with distinction from the University of Karachi in 1967. He received a Master of Arts in Arabic literature, with distinction, from the University of Punjab in 1970.\n\nUsmani received \"ijaza\" to teach hadith from Islamic scholars including Muhammad Shafi, Muhammad Idris Kandhlawi, Qari Muhammad Tayyib, Saleemullah Khan, Mufti Rashid Ahmad Ludhianvi, Sahban Mahmud, Zafar Ahmad Usmani, Muhammad Zakariya Kandhalvi, Hasan al-Mahshat, Abd al-Fattah Abu Ghuddah, Abi Al-Faid Ash-Shafi'i, and others.\n\nHis Teachers also include Mufti Wali Hasan Tonki, the Grand Mufti of Jami' ul Uloom Al-Islamiyyah. He admired the academic methods of Mufti Abd al-Fattah Abu Ghuddah, of whom he wrote an Orbituary to after his demise in his Nuqoosh-e-Raftghaan. He is very close friends with his teacher's nephew Dr. 'Abdu-s-Sattar Abu Ghuddah.\n\nIn tradition to the scholars of Deoband, recognising the importance of Tasawwuf, he traversed the path under the guidance of his Shaikh Dr. Abdul Hai Arifi and Maulana Muhammad Masihullah Khan both khulafa of Hakeemul Ummat Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanwi. He is authorized by both of his mentors in Silsila e Ashrafia: Chistiyyah, Naqshbandiyah, Qadiriyah and Suharwardiyah. In addition to his busy schedule he is himself a mentor to numerous spiritual aspirants all over the world, such as Moulana Sheikh Mohammad Luqman Sahib Ji of the renowned Abu Bakr Trust in Walsall, England.\n\nUsmani pioneered the concept of Islamic banking in Pakistan when he established the Meezan Bank. Usmani has authored a number of books in Arabic, Urdu, and English on Islamic topics in addition to a large number of articles on Islamic banking and finance published in a number of journals and magazines. According to \"The Muslim 500\" website, he is a leading scholar of Islamic Finance, \"Usmani's chief influence comes from his position as a global authority on the issue of Islamic finance.\"\n\nIn March 2004, United Arab Emirates Vice President and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum presented an award to Taqi Usmani in recognition of his lifetime service and achievement in Islamic finance during the annual \"International Islamic Finance Forum\" (IIFF) in Dubai.\n\nIn accordance with the tradition of the scholars of Deoband and recognising the importance of \"tasawwuf\", Usmani's \"bay'ah\" was accepted by Abdul Hai Arifi and Muhammad Masihullah Khan.

He was a key member of a team of scholars which helped declare Ahmadis non-Muslims by Pakistan's National Assembly during the era of former Pakistani president, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, in the 1970s. During the presidency of General Zia ul Haq, he was instrumental in drafting laws pertaining to \"Hudood\", \"Qisas\" meaning \"retaliation in kind\" or (eye for an eye, and \"Diyya\" (blood money).\n\nUsmani strongly opposes elements of modernity, which he describes as engulfing\n\n\"the whole world in the tornado of nudity and obscenity, and has provided an excuse for fornication, and more so it has led under thunder claps to the passage of a bill in the British House of Commons to legalize homosexuality. It is in the shadow of the same modernity that Western women are openly displaying banners on the streets demanding legalization of abortion ...\n\nHe also strongly supports Pakistan's Hudood Ordinances he helped write and strongly opposed the Women's Protection Bill, which he believes violates the injunctions of Quran and Sunnah. He thinks it will not provide a great relief to countless women.\n\nAt a religious conference in 1984 he urged a more \"dynamic attitude\" towards the practice of \"ijtihad\", arguing there is no shortage of fine minds capable of interpreting the sharia, but warning against the contamination of sharia by Western ideas such as the elimination of hudood penalties such as amputation and stoning.\n\nMuhammad Taqi Usmani has been called \"a leading scholar of Islamic jurisprudence\" and \"one of the most successful of the Islamic revivalist initiatives of the past century\", by \"The Muslim 500\" website, which lists him among the 500 \"most influential Muslims\" in the world; and \"one of the leading religious experts on Islamic finance and much sought after person by Islamic financial institutions for their Shari'ah Boards,\" by M.O.Farooq.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArabic\n * Muqaddimah (2017) (26 pages)\n\nUrdu\n\nEnglish\n\n\nMany of these books are available online.

Its mission is to use DNA testing to investigate, litigate and exonerate those in prison who were wrongfully convicted. The chapter was founded in 2005 by a group of volunteers who were inspired by the work of Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld, founders of the Innocence Project in 1992.\n\nA group of volunteers including an Iowa attorney formed the Iowa/Nebraska Innocence Project in 2005 after meeting the founders of the Innocence Project, Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld, and several exonerated people at a national conference. Their goal was to form a local version of the project. By 2007 the Iowa/Nebraska Innocent Project became the Nebraska Innocence Project. The organization is part of the Innocence Network, which is a group of 40 innocence projects across the nation, all working to provide accessible information, consultation on cases, and media resources pro-bono.\n\nThe Nebraska Innocence Project works primarily with cases involving DNA testing. According to the New York Innocence Project, more than 75% of people who have been exonerated in the United States through DNA testing, have served in prison on the basis of faulty eyewitness accounts. Meanwhile, a recent change to Nebraska state law will allow the project to look at cases not involving DNA such as arson cases, Shaken Baby Syndrome, bite marks, and show print-analysis. The Nebraska Innocence Project relies on the work of volunteers and essentially works without a budget. A partnership between the Nebraska chapter and the Midwest Innocence Project, which launched in October 2015, allows Nebraska to take advantage of the Midwest Innocence Project's paid administration, which they intend to do by hiring a paid legal director. To exonerate wrongfully convicted prisoners, the Nebraska Innocence Project sends requests to the Midwest Innocence Project, based in Kansas City, Missouri who prepares the cases and sends them back to Nebraska for investigation and possible litigation. Legal director, Tricia Bushnell assists the Nebraska chapter by organizing cases and finding experts who could help the case.\n\nCommonly referred to the Beatrice 6, a 1985 case in Gage County involved the rape and murder of 68-year-old woman, Helen Wilson, in her apartment. Six people, three men and three women were found guilty of committing the crime. After surfacing evidence that their conviction was based on coerced confessions and the malpractice of forensics, DNA testing of the original evidence proved their innocence. The DNA evidence was the first to be used as means to exonerate someone in the state of Nebraska. The six were awarded between $35,000-$500,00 by the state of Nebraska for their wrongful conviction under the Wrongful Conviction Act.\n\nIn 1975 Juneal Pratt was convicted of rape, sexual assault and robbery of two sisters from Iowa in an Omaha motel. At 19 he was arrested and was picked from a lineup by the two sisters months later despite witnesses who claimed he was at home at the time of the crime. He was sentenced to 32 to 90 years in prison. Pratt has since maintained his innocence and requested DNA testing after a 2001 Nebraska law was passed that allows convicted felons to request DNA testing of preserved evidence if such technology was unavailable during their trial.\n\n\n"}

The main net neutrality provision of this law requires that \"Providers of public electronic communication networks used to provide Internet access services as well as providers of Internet access services will not hinder or slow down services or applications on the Internet\".\n\nThe 2009 EU Telecoms Package left much leeway for member states to implement their own net neutrality directives. The first proposal by the Minister of Economic Affairs, Agriculture and Innovation was submitted to the House of Representatives on November 3, 2010.\n\nIn April 2011, Dutch telecommunications company KPN announced that it would start to block services such as VoIP and instant messaging unless customers paid a fee. Later that week, Vodafone said it was already blocking those services. During an investors meeting in May, KPN admitted to using deep packet inspection. These events accelerated the implementation of net neutrality, as a house majority was against the blocking of specific Internet services.\n\nOn June 22, 2011, the house voted for the amendment of the Telecommunications Act with net neutrality regulations. The Labour Party mistakenly voted for an amendment supported by the Christian parties SGP, CU and CDA that would allow filtering by ISPs for ideological reasons. A rectification was later plugged into an unrelated amendment.\n\nThe amendment was passed by the Senate in 2012, and with the publication of the amendment and the rectification in the official journal of the Netherlands on June 4 and June 5, respectively, network neutrality became the law.\n\nArticle 7.4a of the Telecommunications Act prohibits the hindrance or slowing down of services or applications on the Internet by ISPs and network owners. Deviation from this rule is only allowed:\n\n\nAlso, it is prohibited for ISPs to charge end-users differently for the use of different types of Internet services or applications. Finally, future executive orders can institute minimum quality requirements to prevent the deterioration, hindrance, or slowing down of network communications.\n\nThe director of the former Independent Post and Telecommunications Authority ( \"OPTA\"), now part of the Consumer and Markets Authority, has criticized the current implementation of net neutrality by the Netherlands. He questions whether the consumer actually benefits from the regulations, since it has become very hard for providers to offer a variety of services because of the restrictions posed on providers. He favors transparency and competition instead of strict regulation.\n\nNeelie Kroes, a Dutch politician and the former European Commissioner for Digital Agenda, also supported consumer choice: \"If consumers want to obtain discounts because they only plan to use limited online services, why stand in their way?\" She recognized a need for greater transparency in what services providers do and do not provide, and what limitations there are: \"consumers also need to know if they are getting Champagne or lesser sparkling wine. If it is not full Internet, it shouldn't be marketed as such; perhaps it shouldn't be marketed as 'Internet' at all, at least not without any upfront qualification.\" She also criticized uncoordinated country-by-country legislation, because it slows down the creation of a \"Digital Single Market\".\n\nThe Dutch approach to net neutrality received large attention in Brazil and served as an important reference during the negotiations of the Marco Civil da Internet, the country's Internet Civil Rights Law, approved by the Chamber of Deputies' in March, 2014.\n\nOn April 3, 2014, upon strong support of Commissioner Kroes, the European Parliament voted in favor of maintaining net neutrality throughout European networks. The position might become law, if approved by the European Commission in the upcoming months.\n\nAs of September 2017, Ziggo and XS4All are once again ordered to block The Pirate Bay, this time by the Dutch Court. If the Supreme Court orders this block to stay permanent, it could possibly lead to other sites being blocked thus nullifying the status of Net Neutrality in the Netherlands.\n\n"}

The term is used with contempt for transient workers, based on the derogatory name for the Romani people. Also called a \"jumper\", nuclear gypsies move from one temporary assignment to another nuclear power plant.\n\nThese are \"construction workers, truck drivers, and unemployed men ... [s]ome ... recruited from day-labor centers where jobless people gather hoping to find work.\" About a hundred subcontractors employ about 3,000 workers, compared to about 400 workers directly employed by TEPCO.\nThese temporary workers often have several motives for working under dangerous conditions, which may be high in radioactivity: most often cited are \"high wages and a sense of duty\", but they also do not comprehend the grave risks involved. For example, one worker interviewed by \"The Guardian\" worked temporarily to assist his mother financially, which paid more than truck driving, but he did not realise until after the project completed that he'd been exposed to twice the radiation dose allowed by law. Like all those who depend on casual work for survival, some workers may have alcohol abuse or have other personal issues that make them unsuitable for permanent work. After a 1992 recession, some workers jumped for scarce work at the Fukushima nuclear power plant. In 2011, they were paid the equivalent of $127 per day—much more than many other unskilled labor jobs, but a fraction of what the TEPCO staff earned.\n\nOther hassles are the heat, stifling uniforms, and poor food served in the company mess. There had been insufficient \"rest areas ... water coolers, and ... coolant vests to prevent heatstroke,\" but those problems now are being remedied.\n\n\n"}

The German root \"-fried-\" shares the Proto-Germanic root \"frijaz\" as the archaic English frith , meaning \"peace, tranquility\", \"security, refuge” , modern English \"free\", old German terms for \"fence\" or \"guard\", and the modern German word for \"peace\" \"Friede\". Likewise, the Old English term fredum, a fine paid for \"breaking the peace\" is sometimes still used in legal circles.\n\nAncient Romans used the Latin \"pax\" \"peace\" for domestic peace, international peace, and \"peace with the gods\". All three were implied by the ideology of \"Pax Romana\" in the Roman Empire era.\nMaintenance of the Queen's peace is one of the duties of the Crown, carried out via the Royal Prerogative. Though this power remains the Crown's, through convention it is exercised by the Queen-in-Council; that is, the executive, or, the sovereign acting on the advice of her ministers of the Crown.\n\nThe Crown can be held responsible should it fail in upholding its duty to maintain peace; this was the justification for the Riot Act and subsequent legislation throughout the British Empire. Where civil authorities had declared the Queen's peace as breached (i.e. there was a state of riot), there was a change in the rules: the authorities (whether police, army, or militia providing military aid to the civil power) could shoot and kill the leaders of the riot, and generally take severe action against anyone who was rioting. The counterbalance was that the Crown was responsible for damage caused by the riot, having failed in its duty to preserve the peace. Into the present day, the criminal offence of rioting can only be prosecuted as such with the consent of the Attorney-General (the Queen's legal officer). If disorder does occur but is not prosecuted as rioting, it is officially called a \"civil disturbance\", as deeming it a riot transfers the liability of insurers for any damages or injury occurring from such an event to the local police, which, as they are officers of the Crown, makes the Crown liable to pay.\n\nOfficers of the Queen's peace have the right to detain a person who is creating a \"breach of the peace\". This is not a criminal or civil offence; it exists as a legal oddity created by the Royal Prerogative. Persons so detained must be taken before a magistrate (a Justice of the Peace), who will bind them over to keep the peace, whereafter the person may not disturb the peace again for the appointed time, under threat of imprisonment. The police will frequently use this power to break up difficult situations or minor fights; often, a perpetrator will be detained only briefly, until the officers are satisfied that the fight is over. Alternatively, if alcohol is present, for instance, the offender can be held until sober enough to face the magistrate. Because a breach of the Queen's peace is not a criminal offence, people found to have broken it will not have the charge marked on their criminal record.\n\nMurder remains a common law offence, defined as \"When a man of sound memory and of the age of discretion unlawfully kills any reasonable creature in being and under the King's peace, with malice aforethought, either expressed or implied by law, the death taking place within a year and a day.\" (Russell on Crime, 12th Edition, 1964) However, the Queen's peace excludes killing of the enemy during a war.\n\nHistorically, and in particular before the founding of the police and the modern legal system, the concept of the Queen's peace was much more important. Knights of the Peace were appointed in each shire, and it was their duty to maintain the Queen's peace. These Knights of the Peace later became known as \"Justices of the Peace\", or \"JPs\", and subsequently as magistrates. In the United Kingdom, paid magistrates are now called \"District Judges\", and are drawn from the ranks of local solicitors and barristers. Unpaid magistrates are volunteers from the communitythe requirements are that they must be of good character and local residence.\n\nIn the United States, arrest warrants and charging documents, such as indictments, are often constitutionally required to make reference to an offense having occurred \"against the peace and dignity of\" the respective state or commonwealth.\n\nIn the county palatine areas of the United Kingdomthe Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall, and the County Palatine of Durhamoffences such as murder were deemed to be against the respective bishop's or duke's peace (the Duke of Lancaster being merged with the Crown, but nevertheless a separate office, and the Duke of Cornwall being the Heir to the Throne). This, however, was altered in 1536.\n\n"}

Its base of operations is the port of Vigo. The Pescanova group operates in 24 countries with approximately 12,400 employees. The group includes such companies as:\n\nIn April 2013, the company filed for bankruptcy due to liquidity problems.\n\nPescanova was founded in 1960 by José Fernández López, who established the company in Vigo. From its beginnings Pescanova introduced cutting-edge technology for the complete activity of fish processing, best defined by the factory ship which was not common in Spain at the time. The business model worked and allowed a continued growth making it one of the biggest firms in the fishing industry.\n\nIn 1980 Manuel Fernández de Sousa-Faro, the son of the founder, took over the presidency and, after a period of restructuring, Pescanova became a multinational empire. In 1985 it joined Madrid Stock Exchange.\n\nWith more than 120 fishing boats and 150,000 tons of fish products sold into the global market every year, Pescanova is among the top 5 companies in its sector. Besides the Spanish facilities, the company has production plants in 21 countries, amongst which are Portugal, Nicaragua, Namibia and Honduras. It had in 2013 approximately 3,400 employees.\n\nOn 15 April 2013, Pescanova filed in Spanish court for bankruptcy protection. The insolvency filing mentions debts of 1.5bn euros, but financial sources who have had dealings with the company say total debt is probably more than double that amount, potentially making it the country's third-largest bankruptcy. The court accepted the filing and said it would name independent administrators to replace the board. Pescanova revealed only on the day of the insolvency filing that Fernandez Sousa had sold half his 14.4 percent stake in the company in the months leading up to the filing without telling regulators, as required by law.\n\nThe multinational empire had by January 2014 an accumulated debt of $5.8bn euros, according to Spain's National Securities Market Commission (CNMV). In January 2014, three multinational investment funds were interested to refloat the bankrupt company with approximately 300m euros. The company operated under court protection while arrangements were made. The interested investors are consortia of\n\nThe current board and management were opposed by minority shareholders. A director of Pescanova, Luis Angel Sanchez Merlo, resigned on 14 January 2014.\n\nSimultaneously, negotiations were under way to separate Pesca Chile from the others through an offer by Cooke Aquaculture of Canada and Econsult of Philadelphia.\n\nOn 17 February 2014, Pescanova disclosed a new set of over 2bn euros outstanding loans to its restructuring committee.\nThe loans are trading at about 12 cents on the euro while 160mn euros of its convertible bonds are quoted at about 14 cents. Lenders were willing to accept losses of 60 percent on the debt in exchange for a 90 percent stake in the Pontevedra, Spain-based business.\n\nOn 2 May 2014, the major domestic creditor banks agreed to lift the bankruptcy, and the company remained as one of the Galician multinationals. Damm and Luxempart were sidelined, and as a result, Jose Carceller of Damm and Francois Tesch of Luxempart resigned from the board of directors.\n\nOn 23 May 2014, Pescanova exited bankruptcy proceedings after 403 days. The restructuring plan had received support from 65% of its major domestic creditor banks. The company was to continue under administration by Deloitte, until the subsequent shareholders’ meeting. On 22 May 22, Deloitte reported to the Spanish financial regulator CNMV the resignation of Juan Manuel Urgoiti, who had been chairman of the Spanish multinational since September 2013.\n\nOn 8 January 2015, Manuel Fernandez Sousa-Faro was chastised because of his failure to report a number of properties to the Court, which had fined him for his role in the collapse of Pescanova. In January 2014, Fernandez had been condemned, along with colleagues Carlos Turci, Alfonso Garcia and Angel Gonzales, Alfonso Paz-Andrade, Fernando Fernandez, Robert Albert Williams, Antonio Taboas, Joaquin Vina, Alfredo Lopez and ICS Holding Limited, for their contributions to the collapse of the firm.\n\nOn 2 February 2015, the company reported profits of 1.6bn euros, which contrasted with losses one year earlier that totalled 718mn euros. By 6 February 2015, New York-based hedge fund Broadbill Investment Partners had acquired 3.69% of Pescanova, according to records of the Spanish financial regulator CNMV. The financial regulator showed Pescanova's former chairman Manuel Fernandez de Sousa as the company's largest shareholder with 7.5% of shares, followed by the Spanish heiress Carolina Herrero Masaveu, with 7.1% and Spanish brewery Damm, which lost its bid to control the fishing giant the previous year, with 6.2%.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6998695", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6998695", "title": "Phase I environmental site assessment", "text": "Phase I environmental site assessment\n\nIn the United States, an environmental site assessment is a report prepared for a real estate holding that identifies potential or existing environmental contamination liabilities. The analysis, often called an ESA, typically addresses both the underlying land as well as physical improvements to the property. A proportion of contaminated sites are \"brownfield sites.\" In severe cases, brownfield sites may be added to the National Priorities List where they will be subject to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Superfund program. \nThe actual sampling of soil, air, groundwater and/or building materials is typically not conducted during a Phase I ESA. The Phase I ESA is generally considered the first step in the process of environmental due diligence. Standards for performing a Phase I site assessment have been promulgated by the US EPA and are based in part on ASTM in Standard E1527-13.\n\nIf a site is considered contaminated, a Phase II environmental site assessment may be conducted, ASTM test E1903, a more detailed investigation involving chemical analysis for hazardous substances and/or petroleum hydrocarbons.\n\nAs early as the 1970s specific property purchasers in the United States undertook studies resembling current Phase I ESAs, to assess risks of ownership of commercial properties which had a high degree of risk from prior toxic chemical use or disposal. Many times these studies were preparatory to understanding the nature of cleanup costs if the property was being considered for redevelopment or change of land use.\n\nIn the United States of America demand increased dramatically for this type of study in the 1980s following judicial decisions related to liability of property owners to effect site cleanup. Interpreting the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), the U.S. courts have held that a buyer, lessor, or lender may be held responsible for remediation of hazardous substance residues, even if a prior owner caused the contamination; performance of a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, according to the courts' reasoning, creates a safe harbor, known as the 'Innocent Landowner Defense'.\n\nIn 1998 the necessity of performing a Phase I ESA was underscored by congressional action in passing the Superfund Cleanup Acceleration Act of 1998. This act requires purchasers of commercial property to perform a Phase I study meeting the specific standard of ASTM E1527: Standard Practice for Environmental Site Assessments: Phase I Environmental Site Assessment Process.\n\nThe most recent standard is \"Standards and Practices for All Appropriate Inquiries\" 40 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 312 which drew heavily from ASTM E1527-13, which is the ASTM Standard for conducting 'All Appropriate Inquiry' (AAI) for the environmental assessment of a real property. Previous guidances regarding the ASTM E1527 standard were ASTM E1527-97, ASTM E1527-00, and ASTM E1527-05.\n\nResidential property purchasers need only conduct a site inspection and chain of title survey.\n\nA variety of reasons for a Phase I study to be performed exist, the most common being:\n\n\nScrutiny of the land includes examination of potential soil contamination, groundwater quality, surface water quality and sometimes issues related to hazardous substance uptake by biota. The examination of a site may include: definition of any chemical residues within structures; identification of possible asbestos containing building materials; inventory of hazardous substances stored or used on site; assessment of mold and mildew; and evaluation of other indoor air quality parameters.\n\nDepending upon precise protocols utilized, there are a number of variations in the scope of a Phase I study. The tasks listed here are common to almost all Phase I ESAs:\n\nIn most cases, the public file searches, historical research and chain-of-title examinations are outsourced to information services that specialize in such activities. Non-Scope Items in a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment can include visual inspections or records review searches for:\n\n\nOften a multi-disciplinary approach is taken in compiling all the components of a Phase I study, since skills in chemistry, atmospheric physics, geology, microbiology and even botany are frequently required. Many of the preparers are environmental scientists who have been trained to integrate these diverse disciplines. Many states have professional registrations which are applicable to the preparers of Phase I ESAs; for example, the state of California had a registration entitled \"California Registered Environmental Assessor Class I or Class II\" until July 2012, when it removed this REA certification program due to budget cuts.\n\nUnder ASTM E 1527-13 parameters were set forth as to who is qualified to perform Phase I ESAs. An Environmental Professional is someone with \n\nA person not meeting one or more of those qualifications may assist in the conduct of a Phase I ESA if the individual is under the supervision or responsible charge of a person meeting the definition of an Environmental Professional when concluding such activities.\n\nMost site assessments are conducted by private companies independent of the owner or potential purchaser of the land.\n\nWhile there are myriad sites that have been analyzed to date within the United States, the following list will serve as examples of the subject matter:\n\n\nIn Japan, with the passage of the 2003 \"Soil Contamination Countermeasures Law\", there is a strong movement to conduct Phase I studies more routinely. At least one jurisdiction in Canada (Ontario) now requires the completion of a Phase I prior to the transfer of some types of industrial properties. Some parts of Europe began to conduct Phase I studies on selected properties in the 1990s, but still lack the comprehensive attention given to virtually all major real estate transactions in the USA.\n\nIn the United Kingdom contaminated land regulation is outlined in the Environment Act 1995. The Environment Agency of England and Wales have produced a set of guidance; CLEA a standardized approach to the assessment of land contamination. A Phase 1 Desktop Study is often required in support of a planning application. In the UK these reports must be assembled by a \"competent person\".\n\nThere are several other report types that have some resemblance in name or degree of detail to the Phase I Environmental Site Assessment:\n\nPhase II Environmental Site Assessment is an \"intrusive\" investigation which collects original samples of soil, groundwater or building materials to analyze for quantitative values of various contaminants. This investigation is normally undertaken when a Phase I ESA determines a likelihood of site contamination. The most frequent substances tested are petroleum hydrocarbons, heavy metals, pesticides, solvents, asbestos and mold.\n\nPhase III Environmental Site Assessment is an investigation involving remediation of a site. Phase III investigations aim to delineate the physical extent of contamination based on recommendations made in Phase II assessments. Phase III investigations may involve intensive testing, sampling, and monitoring, \"fate and transport\" studies and other modeling, and the design of feasibility studies for remediation and remedial plans. This study normally involves assessment of alternative cleanup methods, costs and logistics. The associated reportage details the steps taken to perform site cleanup and the follow-up monitoring for residual contaminants.\n\nLimited Phase I Environmental Site Assessment is a truncated Phase I ESA, normally omitting one or more work segments such as the site visit or certain of the file searches. When the field visit component is deleted the study is sometimes called a Transaction Screen.\n\nEnvironmental Assessment has little to do with the subject of hazardous substance liability, but rather is a study preliminary to an Environmental Impact Statement, which identifies environmental impacts of a land development action and analyzes a broad set of parameters including biodiversity, environmental noise, water pollution, air pollution, traffic, geotechnical risks, visual impacts, public safety issues and also hazardous substance issues.\n\nSBA Phase I Environmental Site Assessment means properties purchased through the United States Small Business Administration's 504 Fixed Asset Financing Program require specific and often higher due diligence requirements than regular Real Estate transactions. Due diligence requirements are determined according to the NAICS codes associated with the prior business use of the property. There are 58 specific NAICS codes that require Phase I Investigations. These include, but are not limited to: Funeral Homes, Dry Cleaners, and Gas Stations. The SBA also requires Phase II Environmental Site Assessment to be performed on any Gas Station that has been in operation for more than 5 years. The additional cost to perform this assessment cannot be included in the amount requested in the loan and adds significant costs to the borrower.\n\nFreddie Mac/Fannie Mae Phase I Environmental Site Assessments are two specialized types of Phase I ESAs that are required when a loan is financed through Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. The scopes of work are based on the ASTM E1527-05 Standard but have specific requirements including the following: the percent and scope of the property inspection; requirements for radon testing; asbestos and lead-based paint testing and operations-and-maintenance (O&M) plans to manage the hazards in place; lead in drinking water; and mold inspection. For condominiums, Fannie Mae requires a Phase I ESA anytime the initial underwriting analysis indicates environmental concerns.\n\nHUD Phase I Environmental Site Assessment\nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development also requires a Phase I ESA for any condominium under construction that wishes to offer an FHA insured loan to potential buyers.\n\n"}

As of 2012 PPL collected royalties for 65,000 performers and 10,000 record companies.\n\nIts field of operation is distinct from the Performing Right Society, now called PRS for Music, founded in 1914, which originally collected fees for live performance of sheet music.\n\nPPL was formed in May 1934 by the record companies EMI and Decca Records, following a ground-breaking court case against a coffee shop in Bristol.\n\nThe coffee shop, Stephen Carwardine & Co, had been entertaining its customers by playing records. EMI, then called The Gramophone Company, argued it was against the law to play the record in public without first receiving the permission of the copyright owners. The judge agreed, establishing this as a legal principle. EMI and Decca formed Phonographic Performance Ltd (PPL) to carry out this licensing role and opened the first office in London.\n\nThe Copyright Act 1956 led to the expansion of PPL's role to also cover the licensing of broadcasters that played recorded music. Further copyright law changes in 1988 strengthened PPL's licensing position.\n\nIn 1996, performers were given the rights to receive 'equitable remuneration' where recordings of their performances were played in public or broadcast – leading to PPL paying them royalties directly for the first time. Performer organisations PAMRA and AURA merged with PPL in 2006, leading to an annual meeting and dedicated board specifically for performers.\n\nVPL, created in 1984, is PPL's sister company and specifically deals with the licensing of music videos when they are played in public or broadcast on TV. VPL distributes the fees as royalties to its rights holder members. Although technically a separate company, VPL operates under the same management as PPL. All activities relating to music videos are conducted as VPL business.\n\n\nAny business that plays recorded music within PPL’s repertoire in public, such as a shop, bar, office, restaurant, gym, community building, not-for-profit organisation, or activities such as dance classes will need to have a PPL licence. One exception being a hotel, guest house or B&B that has fewer than 25 rooms and does not have any areas that are open to non-residents (such as a bar or restaurant).\n\nA PPL licence is required when recorded music, within PPL’s repertoire, including radio and TV, is played in public. There is no statutory definition of 'playing in public' (also sometimes referred to as 'public performance') but the UK courts have given guidance on its meaning and ruled that it is any playing of music outside of a domestic setting. So, for example, playing recorded music at a workplace, public event or in the course of any business activities is considered to be 'playing in public. No licence is required for listening on headphones. \nIn contrast, any recorded music being played as part of domestic home life or when there is an audience entirely of friends and/or family (such as at a private family party) does not require a PPL licence.\n\nA PPL licence gives the licence holder the permission to play recorded music from PPL's repertoire (the vast majority of commercially released music in the UK). Playing music that is outside of its copyright term or freely licensed does not require a PPL licence.\n\n\nPPL licenses radio stations based in the UK, Isle of Man and Channel Islands to use recorded music within its repertoire in all forms of radio, from traditional FM/AM broadcasting to satellite and online radio streaming.\n\n\nWith the relevant PPL music licence, broadcasters can use recorded music within PPL’s repertoire and/or music videos in their programming with the permission of the performer and copyright owner.\n\nApplications for music licences can be made online at ppluk.com\n\nAfter administration costs, and certain contributions to anti-piracy activities and music industry charities (all of which are agreed by the membership at the Annual General Meeting), all revenue generated from PPL licence fees is passed onto its registered members as royalties for the use of their recorded music. PPL members range from session musicians and emerging artists to major record labels and globally successful performers. It is free to join PPL as a member.\n\n\nAnyone who owns, or holds an exclusive licence to, the rights for when recorded music is broadcast or played in public in the UK can join PPL as a recording rights holder member. This can include major record labels, independent labels, self-releasing artists or companies that have simply purchased the relevant rights.\n\n\nAnyone who has performed on recorded music can join PPL as a performer member. If an audible contribution has been made to a recorded music track, the performer could be eligible for royalties. This means anybody, from lead singers to choir members rock drummers to classical musicians, who has contributed to a recording could be eligible for PPL royalties. In addition, certain inaudible contributions (such as a conductor) are also eligible.\n\nA licence is required from PPL whenever recorded music within its repertoire is played in public or broadcast. PPL’s repertoire includes all recorded music owned or controlled by its direct members or by members of any of the overseas collective management organisations with which PPL has a reciprocal agreement. PPL’s repertoire covers the vast majority of recorded music commercially available in the UK.\n\nPPL and PRS for Music are two separate independent companies and in most instances a licence is required from both organisations to play recorded music legally in public. While both companies licence the use of music and collect royalties for the music industry, they represent different rights holders and have separate licences, terms, and conditions.\n\nPPL collects and distributes money for the use of recorded music on behalf of record companies and performers. PRS for Music collects and distributes money for the use of the musical composition and lyrics on behalf of authors, songwriters, composers, and publishers.\n\nIn 2018, PPL and PRS for Music formed a jointly owned subsidiary, PPL PRS Ltd, to collect all licence fees for public performances. PPL PRS Ltd is based in Leicester, England,\n\nPPL offers an additional optional service to both record company and performer members to collect revenue due to the members from collective management organisations in numerous countries.\n\n"}

In economic jargon, it is an agreement between more than two countries, but not a great many, which would be multilateral agreement.\n\nThe term \"plurilateral agreement\" is used in the World Trade Organization. A plurilateral agreement implies that WTO member countries would be given the choice to agree to new rules on a voluntary basis. This contrasts with the multilateral WTO agreement, where all WTO members are party to the agreement. The Agreement on Government Procurement is typical plurilateral agreement.\n\nA plurilateral treaty is a special type of multilateral treaty. A plurilateral treaty is a treaty between a limited number of states with a particular interest in the subject of the treaty. The primary difference between a plurilateral treaty and other multilateral treaties is that the availability of reservations is more limited under a plurilateral treaty. Due to the limited nature of a plurilateral treaty, the full cooperation of the parties to the treaty is required in order for the object of the treaty to be met. As a result, reservations to plurilateral treaties are not allowed without the consent of all other parties to the treaty. This principle is codified in international law by article 20(2) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties:\nWhen it appears from the limited number of the negotiating states and the object and purpose of a treaty that the application of the treaty in its entirety between all the parties is an essential condition of the consent of each one to be bound by the treaty, a reservation requires acceptance by all the parties.\n"}

The movement also chose a complete rejection of the nihilist, classical liberal and Marxist movements of the time. Their primary focus was to change Russian society by the humbling of the self and social reform through the Russian Orthodox Church rather than the radical implementations of the intelligentsia. \n\nThe major differences between the Slavophiles and the movement were that the former detested the Westernization policies of Peter the Great, but the latter praised what were seen as the benefits of the notorious ruler but maintained a strong patriotic mentality for the Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality. Another major difference was that many of the movement's leaders and supporters adopted a militantly anti-Protestant, anti-Catholic and anti-Semitic stance.\n\nThe concept had its roots in the works of the German philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder, who focused primarily on emphasizing the differences among people and regional cultures. In addition it rejected the universalism of the Enlightenment period. The most prominent Russian intellectuals who founded the ideology were Nikolay Strakhov, Nikolay Danilevsky and Konstantin Leontyev.\n\nFyodor Dostoyevsky also held such views, as he expressed in his novel \"Demons\".

According to the US Justice Department, Razor 1911 is the oldest software cracking group that is still active on the internet.\n\nThe group was founded as \"Razor 2992\" by Doctor No, Insane TTM and Sector9 in Norway in October 1985 as a Commodore 64 software cracking group. Shortly after, they changed from 2992 to 1911 which translates to 777 in\nhexadecimal.\n\nBetween 1987 and 1988 the group began to move away from the Commodore 64 and migrated to a new hardware platform, coding demos and cracking games for the Amiga. In the very early 1990s Razor 1911 made another transition, this time to the IBM PC, foremost as a cracking group, but still continuing to release cracktro loaders, demos and music.\n\nRazor was a supply group on diskette from 1992 until diskettes were abandoned for CD-ROMs. Throughout the 1990s Razor faced competition from many different groups, ranging from groups such as Tristar & Red Sector inc. (TRSi), International Network of Crackers (INC), The Dream Team (TDT) and Fairlight (FLT) in 1994 to Prestige, Hybrid (HBD), and others in 1995. Razor was revitalised by new members gained from another group, Nexus, who brought with them some UK suppliers and the leaders The Speed Racer (TSR), Hot Tuna and The Gecko. Razor had a handful of others throughout the 1990s, such as Zodact, The Renegade Chemist (TRC), The WiTcH KiNG, Butcher, SwiTch, Marauder, and Randall Flagg.\nIn 1995 diskette releases were rapidly being supplanted by CD-ROMs, and Razor 1911 moved into the CD-ripping scene. The crew that led Razor into this new chapter included members such as TSR, Pharaoh, Fatal Error, GRIZZLY, Suspicious Image, Third Son, Hot Tuna, Beowulf, Pitbull, Bunter, Manhunter, Niteman, Vitas, Mausioso and The Punisher.\n\nRazor once again took on a new challenge when the ISO scene was formed. Razor 1911 began to release ISOs when they became the standard of the day, led most significantly by The Punisher. He was instrumental in Razor's recovery and its solid performance in the ISO scene. Following The Punisher's retirement, Razor was led by various different people and underwent some internal problems in the form of leadership challenges. This was solved when Pitbull, an old Razor member from the 1990s, took over the leadership role. The FBI claimed him to still be the leader of Razor at the time when \"Operation Buccaneer\", an international anti-piracy operation which led to raids at the homes of over 60 piracy suspects worldwide in 2001, was carried out even though NFOs and scene activity at the time points out The Renegade Chemist as actual leader of the group.\n\nOn June 22, 2006, Razor 1911 started releasing games again. They have been releasing games fairly consistently ever since, and as of 2010 are among the most prolific groups at cracking new releases.\n\nOn April 22, 2011, Razor 1911's demo division won the public choice award during the Scene.org Awards ceremony at The Gathering for their 64k intro \"Insert No Coins\" coded by Rez with music from Dubmood.\n\n\n"}

Peña Nieto has set up a number of conceptual and organizational changes from the past regime policy, and one of the biggest contrasts is the focus on lowering murder rates, kidnappings, and extortions, as opposed to arresting or killing the country's most-wanted drug lords and intercepting their drug shipments. The government of Calderón, however, has justified its position by stating that the current violence in the country is a necessary stage in Mexico's drug war, as weakening criminal groups fight for territorial control against one another and the government. Moreover, part of Peña Nieto's strategy also consists on the creation of a national police made up of 40,000 members, known as a \"gendarmerie.\" He also proposed on centralizing the sub-federal police forces under one command. The president-elect emphasized that he does not support the involvement or presence of armed U.S. agents in Mexico, but considers allowing the United States to instruct Mexico's military training in counterinsurgency tactics. Beyond that, Peña Nieto promised that no other measures will be taken by the U.S. in Mexico. While campaigning, Peña Nieto appointed a former general of the National Police of Colombia as his external advisor for public security, and boldly promised to reduce 50% of the murder rates in Mexico by the end of his six-year term.\n\nCritics of Peña Nieto's security strategy, however, say that he has offered \"little sense\" in exactly \"how\" he will reduce the violence. During the three-month campaign, Peña Nieto was not explicit on his anti-crime strategy, and many analysts wonder whether Peña Nieto is holding back politically sensitive details in his security strategy or simply does not know yet how he will squelch the violence and carry out the next stage in Mexico's drug war. Moreover, U.S. officials are worried that the return of Peña Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) after ruling Mexico for 71 years may mean returning to the old PRI tactics of \"corruption [and] backroom deals\" with the cartels in exchange for bribes and relative peace. Peña Nieto denies that he will negotiate with the cartels.\n\nThroughout the administration of Felipe Calderón, the Mexican government argued that the arrests of the top leaders in the drug trafficking organizations did not lead to violence. In a new public campaign, the government released 10 videos that explained the \"myths\" behind Mexico's drug war, one of them including the so-called \"kingpin strategy,\" which focuses on taking down the drug lords and leaders of the drug cartels. The government's counterargument against critiques was that killing or arresting drug kingpins had no effect on the already rising murder rates in an area. In some cases, however, the government argued that violence went down after a drug kingpin was taken out. The most common critique against the kingpin strategy is that arresting or killing leaders in criminal organizations leaves a leadership void, fracturing the cartels and allowing rival groups to take over the assets of the cartel. The theory is used to explain why violence has spiked in the states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo León, where the arrest of the Gulf cartel's leader – Osiel Cárdenas Guillén – led to the split of the two groups that composed the organization: the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas. Back in 2010, the state of Chihuahua lived a similar phenomenon with the rupture of the Sinaloa Cartel and the Beltrán Leyva cartel after the military gunned down Arturo Beltrán Leyva, a top leader in the Beltrán Leyva cartel. Calderón has a different interpretation of the situation, however. He argues that taking down the kingpins does not increase the violence in states that are already among the most dangerous in Mexico. By this theory, the army was sent in to restore order in states already plagued with violence; hence, their presence is a product, not a cause, of the rising murder rates.\n\nPeña Nieto, however, said in a news conference that he can ease the waves of violence in Mexican Drug War by redirecting the focus of the military approach carried out by Mexico's current president, Felipe Calderón. Instead of focusing primarily on taking down the heads of the criminal organizations and the most-wanted drug lords of the cartels, he proposes to use government resources to put down homicides, kidnappings, and extortions—crimes that do the most damage to the Mexican people—by flooding troops and police into places with the highest rates of violence crimes. Peña Nieto, however, said that his proposal does not mean that the government will not tackle other crimes nor prevent drug trafficking, but rather noted that arresting drug bosses will no longer be the focus of his administration. Opponents of Peña Nieto have said that the PRI's return will mean the going back to the \"old PRI model\" of making deals with the cartels. Nonetheless, the presidential candidate has praised Calderón's decision of sending in troops to fight the cartels, and has emphasized plans to increase the military presence in areas most effected by drug-related violence, like Monterrey and Veracruz. The security policy of Peña Nieto does not say that it will stop fighting the drug cartels; it proposes that it will simply shift away from targeting the heads of the cartels. This redirection is a response to the criticism made by critics to Calderón for targeting a few main cartels and splitting them up into smaller and more violent factions. Peña Nieto's strategy would align with a new strain of thinking for the general public, which calls for law enforcement in both the United States and Mexico to make the reduction of violence, kidnappings, and extortion their overwhelming focus in the War on Drugs. According to Reuters, other experts argue that Mexico's criminal groups do not have to be provoked and often ambush Mexico's security forces when they are on patrol, and that the cartels have become so violent that the Mexican government will have no other option but to keep battling them – whether they want to or not.\n\nNonetheless, Eric Olson, a U.S.-Mexico security co-operation scholar from the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, advocates a similar strategy for the reduction of violence. Olson acknowledged that the government should slow down its attacks against cartels that are less violent than others, and focus on Mexico's \"biggest problem, the violence that is terrorizing the population and undermining the legitimacy of the state.\" Olson said that crime will always exist, but one can make it less harmful by getting it out of people's lives as much as possible. He concluded by saying that this proposal is not a \"de facto negotiation\" with the cartels—but rather a question of what comes first. Some U.S. officials, however, are concerned that Peña Nieto's strategy will mean the return to the old and corrupt practices of the PRI regime, where the government made deals and turned a blind eye on the cartels in exchange for peace. After all, they worry that Mexico's drug war, which has cost over 50,000 lives, will make Mexicans question on why they should \"pay the price for a US drug habit.\" Peña Nieto denies, however, that his party will tolerate corruption and stated he will not make deals with the cartels. On 1 July 2012, the day of the election, the president-elect said the following:\nPeña Nieto has repeated throughout his campaign that he will build a new 40,000-member paramilitary police that will be dispatched to the areas plagued by drug-violence. The creation of the \"national gendarmerie\" is planned to be bigger than the size of the Federal police, with added patrols, greater intelligence, and made up by soldiers already deployed during the \"sexenio\" of Felipe Calderón. His aim in the creation of this new police, besides reducing the violence, is supporting the municipalities with major institutional weakness, since he said that some municipalities in Mexico lack a police force. The success of the new gendarmerie is largely going to be reflected on its funding level; for years, Mexico has reorganized, renamed, and created new security organizations because the past agencies have proven to be inefficient and corrupt. The funding capacity of the government will therefore be crucial for the success of the gendarmerie, because if it is poorly funded it will most likely be infiltrated by the drug trafficking organizations and be doomed to failure.\n\nThe new gendarmerie will be deployed mostly to rural areas, but security experts have mentioned that moving security resources out of the urban areas may be troubling for cities. The idea of such a force appears to be a response to the assuaging critics of Felipe Calderón's overwhelming dependence on the Mexican Armed Forces to confront the drug cartels. Human rights advocates and policy experts said that the use of the troops brought human rights violations, and emphasized the building of a capable civilian police force. Peña Nieto's new gendarmerie, however, will be composed of ranks from the Mexican military, raising doubts on whether or not his proposal will simply be a repackaging of Calderón's military-led strategy. In addition, Alejandro Hope, a security expert and former member of the CISEN, Mexico's intelligence agency, wrote on May 2012 about the unanswered questions regarding the creation of the new gendarmerie. In one case, he wrote that the creation of Peña Nieto's new police force will not be much different from keeping the current troops under a military command. As Hope points out, \"unless the [new gendarmerie] is magic,\" the scenario will be the same people performing the same duties and with the same equipment. In a second scenario, Hope wrote how the military will actively support the gendarmerie in problem areas. Consequently, he pointed out that this scenario will eliminate the only advantage of having a gendarmerie: lacking any involvement or command from a military unit. The final critique of Hope was the idea that the new gendarmerie will be made up of ex-military members. He points out that the two largest pools to get these kind of people would be from retired or deserters of the Armed Forces, neither which Hope considers desirable members in a gendarmerie. According to InSight Crime, the gendarmerie proposal issued by Peña Nieto gives critics an opening to suggest that he is \"playing to the frustrations of the Mexican people\" and suggesting police reforms simply for the sake of changing Calderón's strategy, even if it does not improve the security measures throughout Mexico.\n\nThe force's impact would also depend on \"how\" it is used. If Peña Nieto decides to shift the gendarmerie from hotspot to hotspot and not allow the force to pave its continuity in a given area, it may have little impact in putting down the violence. Nonetheless, if Peña Nieto decides to focus the gendarmerie to target certain cells within the cartels that are involved extortions and kidnappings, it may be successful.\n\nAccording to a 2013 report published by the Washington Office on Latin America looking at the first year of Peña Nieto's administration, the gendarmerie, originally advertised as a 40,000-member paramilitary police force, will be reduced to 5,000 civilian members within the Federal Police, and will not be operational until July 2014.\n\nPeña Nieto promised that if he was voted in, he would appoint Óscar Naranjo as his security advisor, a prominent Colombian police general. Naranjo is highly qualified for the job, having already lived the transformation of a discredited police force in Colombia. In the 1980s, when Naranjo was a young officer, Colombia's police force had very similar problem to the one in Mexico: almost all the police was under the payroll and service of the drug lords. Today, the National Police of Colombia is a model of reform in Latin America and often train police forces around the hemisphere. As head of the police force, Naranjo's \"single greatest achievement\" was Colombia's creation of the most effective and sophisticated intelligence agency in the region. According to InSight Crime, Naranjo has worked closely with several corrupt officials, and accused on more than one occasion of being corrupt himself. But although rarely acknowledged, working on a regular basis with officials one cannot trust and gently discharging them with minimal harm like Naranjo did is essential to reform efforts. \"CS Monitor\" alleges that Naranjo knew how to marginalize corrupt officials and maximize the use of his honest personnel. Nonetheless, Naranjo will be working in Mexico, a country with twice the population of Colombia, and with many of the police forces working at a municipal and state level and out of the federal control. The bureaucratic and political challenges that Naranjo will face in Mexico may stifle his attempts to reform the country's police force. Naranjo will also be handling a different organizational structure, which may perpetuate \"political battles\" between the SPP, the Secretariat of National Defense, and the Attorney General of Mexico over who keeps certain resources, information, and prestige.\n\nPeña Nieto promises that Naranjo's incorporation will bring Mexico into a robust focus on the financial networks of the cartels, just like the strategy that was implemented in Colombia. Nonetheless, it is still unclear whether attacking the financial sectors of the drug cartels will bring down the violence. According to \"The Huffington Post\", Naranjo said that the new gendarmerie will not just target major drug traffickers, but mid-level and lower-level cartel hitmen as a way of reducing the violence. He also mentioned that Peña Nieto might fulfill his promise of bringing down the number of murders and kidnappings by 50% during his six years as president. The tactic used by Naranjo in Colombia has generated questions whether that strategy could produce similar results in a different country. In addition, according to InSight Crime, it is highly unlikely that Peña Nieto will bring such a drop in the murder rate with his security policies alone. However, there are tentative signs as of 2012 that the violence in Mexico is already peaking and that the cartels are opting for policies of more cautiousness and lower visibility, which could mean that it could begin to decline significantly during Peña Nieto's administration.\n\nDuring an interview with \"PBS NewsHour\" as president-elect, Peña Nieto said that Mexico – along with Latin America and the United States – should have a debate about drug legalization and the regulation of drug sales in the country, an approach advocated by some Latin American leaders who want to reduce the revenues of the drug trafficking organizations by legalizing marijuana. He insisted, however that he is not in favor of legalizing narcotics, but is in favor of opening a new debate to fight drug trafficking. According to Peña Nieto, the War on Drugs has not provided positive results because it has not reduced drug consumption nor drug trafficking, which means that the policy is \"not moving in the right direction.\" Peña Nieto also spoke with Fareed Zakaria in an airing interview through CNN where he called for a \"new debate\" on the drug war, saying the U.S. should play a major role in the discussion and stating:\nBy arguing that the legalization debate should be discussed, Peña Nieto is echoing that Mexico is prepared to move in the direction that several leaders in Latin America have openly debated. During the 6th Summit of the Americas on April 2012, for the first time, many leaders in the Latin American world debated at the summit – although behind closed doors – whether they should stop following the \"U.S.-sponsored-and-dictated\" War on Drugs, partially legalize drugs, or regulate the drug trade. According to \"The Huffington Post\", the debate reached President Barack Obama, but coverage of the debate by the U.S. media was lessened because of competition from an embarrassing sex scandal involving the U.S. Secret Service and some prostitutes. Nevertheless, the message from the Latin America leaders was clear: \"[they] no longer accept the American line on drug policy.\"\n\nPeña Nieto wants to expand Mexico's drug war partnership with the United States, but discarded the presence of armed U.S. agents in Mexico. Moreover, the president-elect supported hosting U.S military training on Mexican soil, but only for training purposes and to help the Mexican Armed Forces benefit from the U.S. counterinsurgency tactics learned in the Iraq War and in the War in Afghanistan. He also approved the continuation of flights by U.S. surveillance drones to gather information on drug trafficking, but stated that further missions would be handled by the Mexican authorities with assistance and technology from the United States. Moreover, the incorporation of the former Colombian police general Óscar Naranjo signals that Peña Nieto will be a solid partner with the U.S., since Naranjo is close to the U.S. military and law-enforcement agencies.\n\nUnlike countries like Honduras, Guatemala, and Colombia, where the U.S. combats drug trafficking side-by-side with local police and the military, Peña Nieto resisted similar joint operations by claiming that they would violate Mexico's sovereignty and its written Constitution. There are no U.S. military bases in Mexico; and by law, American-law enforcement agents are not allowed to carry any weapons in Mexico, even for personal protection.\n\nA report issued by the United States Senate on July 2012 concluded that the deployment of the military to fight against organized crime in Mexico has largely been \"ineffective\" and has increased the homicide rates in the country. It was written to help guide Congress towards the new strategy of Peña Nieto, who suggested that his regime will focus on bringing down the violence rather than arresting and killing top drug barons and carrying out drug seizures heading to the world's largest drug consumer, the United States. Rather than giving away billions of dollars in equipment to Mexico, the report urges for a policy change towards teaching and training Mexico's police, who are outgunned and corrupted by the criminal groups. Overall, the report offers an assessment that may take years, perhaps even a whole generation, to materialize. In the report, a statement concluded the following:\nIn response to the report, the Federal government of Mexico rejected the claims of the U.S. Senate and stated that the government has worked extensively to disband the criminal groups, reform its courts and judicial system, improve its Federal Police, and strengthen the capacity of the Mexican Armed Forces. They also warned that their actions will be worthless and insufficient if the United States does not assume responsibility in stopping the flow of weapons to Mexico, combating money laundering, and reducing drug consumption.\n\nFar from only being receiving accusations of spreading fake news, the Mexican government of EPN has also been accused of violence towards news journalists, and of spying on them, and also towards civil right leaders and their families. During his tenure as president, Peña Nieto has been accused of failing to protect news journalists, whose deaths are speculated to be politically triggered, by politicians attempting to prevent them from covering political scandals. The New York Times published a news report on the matter titled, \"In Mexico it's easy to kill a journalist\", on it mentioning how during EPN's government, Mexico became one of the worst countries in which to be a journalist. The assassination of journalist Javier Valdez on May 23, 2017 received national coverage, with multiple news journalists asking for \"real protection\", as well as freedom of speech. The president announced to be \"deeply wounded\" by such death, Despite this Mexican citizens, as well as political party of opposition perceived the presidential words as hypocritical, and the outlook does not look favorable with Mexico already leading as the country most journalist killed in 2017, with 5 assassinations.\n\nOn June 19, 2017, \"The New York Times\" in conjunction with news reporter Carmen Aristegui, and even backed by a Televisa news reporter Carlos Loret de Mola, reported that the Mexican Government uses a spyware software known as Pegasus, to spy on targets such as Mexican News reporters (and their families) and Civil Rights Leaders (and their families) using text messages as lures. Since 2011, the Mexican Government invested $80 million worth of spyware. Pegasus spyware infiltrates a persons cellphone and reports every detail of their messages, e-mails, contacts and calendars. After the revelation, the Israeli manufacturer of the Pegasus spyware, NSO Group, re-stated it only sold such technology to governments with an 'explicit agreement', that such technology was meant 'only to combat organized crime' by spying on it; although once it sells the software it cannot control who they use it against and basically leaves the government's on their own to monitor themselves on not abusing the software. The New York Times and independent forensic analysts analyzed the data of 'dozens of messages', multiple times before proving their accusation, and commented of such espionage towards news journalists and civil rights leaders, as 'an effort from the Mexican Government to thwart the battle against corruption infecting every limb of Mexican Society', and how highly unlikely it would be for such espionage it to receive 'Judicial Approval'. Edward Snowden who worked for US government's NSA before revealing it to spy on its citizens, also said all evidence points to the Mexican government being the spy, and on twitter said it is \"a crime to the public\".\n\nThe hacking attempts were 'highly personalized' for each target, they would consist of sending text messages with an attached link, and for the spyware to enter a users smartphone, all it needed was for the smartphone owner to click on the link. The news reporter Carmen Aristegui, whom previously in 2014, had revealed a conflict of interest regarding the president ownership of a Mexican \"Casa Blanca (White House)\" and was unfairly fired from her job for airing such investigation, herself, received 22 hacking attempts, the most for any journalist who has been found targeted, one of those attempts disguised as a message sent by an American Embassy in Mexico, trying to help her with a problem with her Visa; additionally Aristegui's son Emilio Aristegui received attempts for 23 months despite being an under-age 16-year-old teen. News media perceived attempts at Aristegui as revenge from the Mexican government. News reporter Carlos Loret de Mora received 8 attempts. While, Juan E. Pardinas, the director of the \"Mexican Institute of Competitiveness\", also received multiple attempts where he was told men with guns were outside his house and another where a contact not on his list invited him to his father's funeral because saying he was a \"close friend\", the attempt on his wife went as far as claiming Padilla was having an extramarital affair, but she could only see the evidence if she clicked the link. Also, most of the parents, protesters and the major leaders of the investigations of the \"Ayotzinapa, 43 Students Massacre\" received spyware messages, so did the \"Women of Atenco\" (a scandal directly tied to Enrique Peña Nieto's time as Governor of the State of Mexico).The New York Times article contained a picture of EPN.\n\nOn June 20, 2017, the day after. The opposition political party, National Action Party (PAN) denounced the Mexican government to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights for suspicions of violations towards human rights and requested them, to lead an investigation citing such spying causes violations towards the article 16th of the Mexican Constitution, as well as violating article 11th of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. While, in response to the accusations, Peña Nieto made public that such technology was bought and indeed used by the Mexican government, but he denied misuses, and stated that it was only used to protect Mexicans by searching for criminal by saying he \"also felt spied upon, but there was nothing more fake than blaming the (Mexican) government\", and that there was \"no proof\"; saying he ordered the PGR an investigation and that he hoped \"under the law, it can be applied against those that have raised false accusations against the government.\", with the last part of the quote making journalist hacking victims feel threatened. Which forced the Mexican president to call writer of the article Azam Ahmed to tell him, he was not menacing him. However, due to his previous presidential scandals, Peña Nieto words lacked credibility to most Mexicans, with journalists like Jorge Ramos complaining about how Enrique Peña Nieto remains in power despite his illegal actions. Later on the day political rival Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO) who competed for the presidency against EPN in 2012 and intends to compete again in 2018 as the candidate from the MORENA political party, was also revealed to be among the hacking targets, with his son also as a target. On June 23, 2017, the National Human Rights Commission (Mexico) opened a case regarding the government espionage.\n\nIn November 2017, Aristegui Noticias reported that \"the PRI and their allies were seeking to approve the \"Ley de Seguridad Interior (Law of Internal Security)\". Whom the Mexican National Human Rights Commission (CNDH) had previously said, that it violated Human Rights, because it favors the discretional usage of the army forces. Endangering citizens by giving a blank check to the army\" and the president, to order an attack towards any group of people they consider a danger without requiring an explanation. This could include people such as social activists. Enrique Peña Nieto signed off the law in approval, while CNDH decided to demand the Mexican government until the law fits a criteria that does not violate human rights.\n\nNew York Times published an article of December 2017, describing accusations towards EPN's government blocking its own investigations against corruption in the Mexican government, with a commissioner saying the Mexican government preventing the establishment of an impartial leader in the FEPADE in charge of investigating political corruption. Previously mentioned 22 ex-governors all members of the PRI political party are investigated for corruption with only five jailed.\n\nBy March 2018 in the dawn of the next presidential election, the PGR made official an investigation regarding PAN's candidate Ricardo Anaya laundering money. Ex-chief of FEPADE (the Mexican government's branch focused on political crimes), Santiago Nieto, whom the previous October had been controversially removed from his job as chief of FEPADE, coincidentally right after starting an investigation regarding illicit campaign money from the 2012 presidential campaign, received by EPN and would be president of Pemex, Emilio Lozoya from the Brazilian conglomerate Odebrecht. The ex-chief of FEPADE, said that the accusations towards Anaya were minor in comparison to Odebretch and EPN scandal, adding also the same opinion about the money lost by SEDESOL, to corrupt governors from the PRI such as Javier Duarte and Cesar Duarte, all while PRI's presidential candidate Jose Antonio Meade was the man in charge of SEDESOL (the scandal is known as \"La Estafa Maestra (The Master Robbery)\" and about $435 million pesos were lost). The same week the PRI legislators were criticized for voting towards stopping the investigation of Odebretch against the wishes of Mexican people and organizations against corruption such as \"Mexicanos contra la corrupcion (Mexicans against Corruption)\". The investigation about Odebretch against Pemex leader at the time Lozoya, was legally stopped after, a judge controversially ordered it days after. Satiago Nieto said that the PGR was being used as tool by EPN's government to tamper elections and benefit Meade by removing Anaya from the race, complaining that it was not neutral the manner in whom the law enforcing organizations had made more effort to investigate Anaya in a month than towards investigating EPN's Odebretch money and Meade's SEDESOL lost money in the last six years. Going as far as saying the PGR and FEPADE were only attacking the rivals of the PRI, and saying the organizations were not being neutral.\n\nJavier Duarte went to jail in 2017, though, Cesar Duarte despite the overwhelming evidence against him, in March 2018, the PGR found him innocent of any crime. The successor governor Javier Corral from the PAN, who previously fought against the Televisa law, gave a similar opinion to Santiago Nieto, saying the PGR was being used to protect the allies of EPN and the PRI, and attack their rivals. AMLO said that not preceding towards Duarte, is one of the main reasons Mexicans lost their faith in the PRI, saying the few ex-governors declared criminals were only to simulate they care.\n\nIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Santiago Nieto would later reveal that EPN's government tried to bribe him to keep him silent, which he refused saying “Sorry, but I can’t receive any money from Peña Nieto.”, he received menaces through phone messages with the words \"Death follows you\" and \"Words of advice: stay out of Trouble\", as a consequence he revealed to fear for the life of himself and his family.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3749079", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3749079", "title": "Self-defence (Australia)", "text": "Self-defence (Australia)\n\nIn the criminal law of Australia, self-defence is a legal defence to a charge of causing injury or death in defence of the person or, to a limited extent, property, or a partial defence to murder if the degree of force used was excessive.\n\nIn \"Viro v The Queen\", Justice Mason formulated six propositions on the law of self-defence in murder trials. Thus, a full acquittal is achieved if the jury finds that an accused reasonably believed they were threatened with death or serious bodily harm and, if so, that the force used was reasonably proportionate to the perceived danger.\nIn \"Zecevic v Director of Public Prosecutions\", the victim rented a unit from the defendant. The defendant became increasingly annoyed with the victim who kept leaving the security gates of the unit unlocked. After one heated exchange, the defendant was stabbed by the tenant. The defendant, fearing that the tenant was about to get a gun from his car, rushed off and got his shotgun. The defendant returned, and shot and killed the tenant. The majority of the High Court said at 661: \n\nThe New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in \"R v Burgess; R v Saunders\" held that 'the concept of self-defence only arises where the actions of the accused by way of self-defence are directly taken against the person threatening the accused or another’s being or property.'\n\nIn \"R v Conlon\" the accused used a shotgun to repel two trespassers whom he believed to be stealing his cannabis plants. His belief was affected by drunkenness and a schizoid personality disorder which were relevant to determine whether the Crown had proved that he had not acted in self defence: specifically whether he believed that it was necessary to do what he did and whether that was a reasonable belief. This question seems advantageous to the defence because it tests whether the belief is reasonable to the accused (a subjective test), not reasonable to the reasonable person (objective test).\n\nIn NSW, ss 418-423 of the \"Crimes Act 1900\" now govern the law relating to self-defence and excessive self-defence (see below).\n\nUnder South Australian law, the general defence appears in s15(1) Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA) for defending a person's life, and s15A(1) for defending property, subject to a hybrid test, i.e. the defendant honestly believed the threat to be imminent and made an objectively reasonable and proportionate response to the circumstances as the accused subjectively perceived them.\n\nIn July 2003, the Rann Government (SA) introduced laws allowing householders to use \"whatever force they deem necessary\" when confronted with a home invader. \nHouseholders who kill or injure a home invader escape prosecution provided they can prove they had a genuine belief that it was necessary to do so to protect themselves or their family. The law was strongly opposed by then-Director of Public Prosecutions Paul Rofe, , and lawyer Marie Shaw, who is now a District Court Judge.\n\nThe rationale of the defence recognises that the degree of culpability normally associated with murder may be missing. In the High Court case of \"Viro v The Queen\", Aickin J said:\n\nThe defence was first recognised in the common law in \"R v McKay\", where a farmer shot and fatally wounded a chicken thief, and confirmed in \"R v Howe\" where Mayo J held at 121-122:\nThis mitigatory defence was abolished in \"Zecevic v Director of Public Prosecutions\" which expressed the view that provocation should be the alternative considered. The defence was re-introduced in statutory form in South Australia in 1991, revised in 1997. The Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA) s15 now reads:\ns15A extends the partial defence to circumstances where the accused had applied excessive force in killing the deceased but had genuinely\nbelieved the force to be necessary and reasonable:\nIn 2002, New South Wales reintroduced excessive self defence as s421 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Section 421 states:\notherwise criminally responsible for manslaughter.\n\nUnlike South Australian law, s420 of the NSW Crimes Act explicitly states that self-defence is \"not\" available as a defence to murder if death is inflicted to prevent criminal trespass.\n\nIn November 2005, pursuant to recommendations from the Law Reform Commission for Victoria, the Victorian legislature introduced new laws regarding self defence. Among them, a new offence of defensive homicide was created: where the accused's belief in the need for the force applied in self-defence was unreasonable, s/he may be convicted of an offence less serious than murder. However, defensive homicide was abolished in November 2014.\n\n"}

The latter is called a concurrent site license.\n\nThe term \"site\" may not necessarily refer to a physical site or geographic location. It is simply defines a limitation on the user's access rights. The usage of the term dates back to 1950s, when mainframes limited to a specific sites were being used.

Vendors may insert clauses that would allow representatives to visit the site and verify that the software usage confirms to the license. Site licenses are sometimes called multiseat licenses in implied distinction from individual (single-seat) licenses; this usage parallels the terminology of multiseat configurations for mainframes, with the same figurative analogy of multiple workers each seated in front of an instance (one terminal or one copy of the application). The cost of the license can then be analyzed in terms of cost per installed seat, with the idea being that such cost must be lower if site licensing is to be advantageous over individual licensing.\n\nAnother usage of the \"site licensing\" term refers to the deals made by large institutions, like universities, with software firms so that affiliated persons can buy the software at discounted prices. \n"}

It went through about 20 editions between its first edition in 1618 and the last in 1746. With its roots in Crompton, Fitzherbert and Lambard, the book offers advice on a wide range of issues including levying customs, highways, prisons, riots, soldiers, murder, felonies, rogues, vagabonds, wool and high treason. The alphabetical listing of topics was groundbreaking and was a model for the structure of other books that came later.\n\nThe Country Justice was one of many, but perhaps the most influential, of legal handbooks through which English common law entered into the legal system of early settlement in New England. Dalton was a justice of the peace in Cambridge and wrote this handbook to guide local justices of the peace who had no formal legal training. The simple, direct writing style contributed to the popularity of the book both in England and in the colonies. There was an earlier handbook, also alphabetized, written by William Lambarde, called the Eirenarcha. By 1619 Lambarde’s book had already seen 13 editions.\n\nIncluded among the many issues dealt with in The Country Justice were guidelines to deal with witchcraft and witches.

On successful completion of the training contract, the trainee will qualify and be admitted as a solicitor.\n\nTrainee solicitors and training contracts were formerly known as articled clerks and articles of clerkship, respectively.\n\nIn Scotland the system is similar to that in England and Wales. In order to become a trainee solicitor, the student must complete an undergraduate degree in law, or complete the Law Society of Scotland examinations, before undertaking a one-year Diploma in Legal Practice. This qualifies the graduate to receive an Entrance Certificate and begin a traineeship.\n\nTraineeships are obtained through the open job market and there is no guarantee that a graduate will secure one.

It created the dole (weekly cash unemployment benefits) system of payments to unemployed workers. The Act passed at a time of very little unemployment, when the Conservatives dominated Parliament. It set up the dole system that provided 15 weeks of unemployment benefits to over 11 million workers--practically the entire civilian working population except domestic service, farm workers, railway workers, and civil servants. Funded in part by weekly contributions from both employers and employed, it provided weekly payments of 15s for unemployed men and 12s for unemployed women. Historian Charles Loch Mowat calls this legislation \"Socialism by the back door,\" and notes how surprised politicians were when the costs to the Treasury soared during the high unemployment of 1921.\n\n"}

The convention aims to prohibit the military or other hostile use of environmental modification techniques that have widespread, long-lasting, or severe effects. The convention entered into force on 5 October 1978.\n\nAccording to the historical narrative of the U.S. Department of State, \"although the use of environmental modification techniques for hostile purposes does not play a major role in military planning at the present time,\" the U.S. Government sought that such techniques might be developed in the future and \"would pose a threat of serious damage unless action was taken to prohibit their use.\" Accordingly, in July 1972, the U.S. Government renounced the use of climate modification techniques for hostile purposes, even if their development were proved to be feasible in the future. The following year, they called for international agreement to avoid the military use of environmental and geophysical modifications and, after exploring the possible uses, reached out to the former Soviet Union (USSR). In 1974 and 1975, U.S. President Richard Nixon and Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev held three sets of discussions on the issue. In 1975, the two nations began negotiating specific terms at the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament (CCD). Finalized in 1976, the agreed text was sent to the UN General Assembly for consideration during the fall session. On 10 December 1976, the resolution was approved with 96 to 8 votes, 30 abstaining.\nIn the treaty text \"Environmental Modification Technique\" is defined as follows:\n\n"}

The act was based on model legislation written by Harry H. Laughlin and challenged by the Supreme Court decision of Buck v. Bell. The Supreme Court upheld the law; consequentially, proving that it was constitutional and making it model law for sterilization laws in other states. Justice Holmes wrote that a patient may be sterilized \"on complying with the very careful provisions by which the act protects the patients from possible abuse.\" Between 1924 and 1979, Virginia sterilized over 7,000 individuals under the act. The act was never declared unconstitutional; however, in 2001, the Virginia General Assembly passed a joint resolution apologizing for the misuse of \"a respectable, 'scientific' veneer to cover activities of those who held blatantly racist views.\" In 2015, the Assembly agreed to compensate individuals sterilized under the act.\n\nDuring the early 20th century, Harry H. Laughlin, director of the Eugenics Record Office at Cold Spring Harbor, New York, became concerned that states were not enforcing their eugenics laws. In 1922, he published his book, \"Eugenical Sterilization in the United States\", which included a \"MODEL EUGENICAL STERILIZATION LAW\" in Chapter XV.\n\nBy 1924, 15 states had enacted similar legislation; however, unlike Virginia, many or most or all of those states failed to rigidly enforce their laws requiring specific qualities in all persons seeking to marry. Forced sterilization, however, was much more common. By 1956, twenty-four states had laws providing for involuntary sterilization on their books. These states collectively reported having forcibly sterilized 59,000 people over the preceding 50 years.\n\nVirginia implemented Laughlin's \"Model Eugenical Sterilization Law\" with little modification two years after it was published.\n\nAn act, passed by the General Assembly of Virginia in 1988 and amended in 2013, provides the procedural requirements necessary for a physician to lawfully sterilize a patient capable of giving informed consent and incapable of giving informed consent. A physician may perform a sterilization procedure on a patient if the patient is capable of giving informed consent, the patient consents to the procedure in writing, and the physician explains the consequences of the procedure and alternative methods of contraception. A court may authorize a physician to perform a sterilization on a mentally incompetent adult or child after the procedural requirements are met and the court finds with clear and convincing evidence the patient is or is likely to engage sexual activity, no other contraceptive is reasonably available, the patient's mental disability renders the patient permanently unable to care for a child, and the procedure conforms with medical standards.\n\nIn February 2001, the Virginia General Assembly passed a joint resolution, introduced by Mitchell Van Yahres, expressing regret for Virginia's experience with eugenics. In the 2002 session, Van Yahres introduced a joint resolution honoring the memory of Carrie Buck. This joint resolution was passed by the House and Senate in February 2002. In same year, Bob Marshall, introduced a joint resolution referencing the 2001 eugenics resolution and calling for the establishment of a subcommittee to study issues related to stem cell research; however, this resolution did not pass the Rules committee. In 2013 and 2014, Marshall introduced the Justice for Victims of Sterilization Act to give compensation for up to $50,000 per person; however, the bill did not get past the Appropriations committee in either year. In 2015, Patrick A. Hope reintroduced the Justice for Victims of Sterilization Act, and although the Act did not get past the Appropriations committee, an amendment was added to the budget bill to give compensation of up to $25,000 per person who was \"involuntarily sterilized pursuant to the Virginia Eugenical Sterilization Act.\"\n\nThe legislature authorized compensation of up to $25,000 per claim to provide compensation for individuals sterilized \"pursuant to the Virginia Eugenical Sterilization Act and who were living as of February 1, 2015.\" If the person died on or after February 1, 2015, a claim may be submitted by the estate or personal representative of the person who died.\n\nLewis Reynolds, a United States Marine Corps veteran sterilized for epilepsy, said that he would be happy to get $25,000 dollars, but he would have preferred to get \n$50,000, the amount given under North Carolina's eugenics compensation program. Mark Bold, CEO of the Christian Law Institute, stated that the language the legislature developed was overly broad and allowed social workers and communities to target individuals for sterilization for even trivial reasons.\n\n"}

On June 12, 2012, state officials announced that enough signatures in favor of the referendum had been submitted and scheduled the referendum to appear on the ballot in the November 6 general election. The law was upheld by voters in the November 6, 2012 election by a final margin of 7.4% (53.7% approve, 46.3% reject) and the result was certified on December 5.\n\nThe ballot title read as follows:\n\nThe ballot measure was accompanied by the following summary:\n\nTitle 26 of the Revised Code of Washington, entitled \"domestic relations\", governs marriage in Washington state. A 2012 bill, Senate Bill 6239, would legalize same-sex marriage and convert into a marriage on June 30, 2014, any undissolved state registered domestic partnership that does not involve at least one party aged 62 years or older. It also would add language at Section 26.04.010 exempting religious organizations from any requirement to \"provide accommodations, facilities, advantages, privileges, services, or goods related to the solemnization or celebration of a marriage\". Governor Christine Gregoire signed the engrossed bill on February 13. The bill was scheduled to take effect June 7 – 90 days after the end of the legislative session — but opponents submitted on June 6 the necessary signatures to suspend the bill and require a statewide voter referendum. On June 12, the Washington secretary of state announced that enough signatures had been submitted to place the referendum on the ballot for the November general election.\n\nStatements for and against the bill are available online as part of the official online voter's guide for the referendum. Per Section 42.17A on \"campaign disclosure and contribution\", the Washington state Public Disclosure Commission posted campaign information online, including information for referenda and initiatives, showing seven groups registered for approval of the bill and one against. Of these, Washington United for Marriage (WUM) and Preserve Marriage Washington were the most active, for and against the bill respectively.\n\nWUM lists \"a coalition of more than 500 organizations and businesses\" on its website. Amazon's Jeff Bezos and his wife pledged $2.5 million in support of the same-sex marriage law. Steve Ballmer of Microsoft and co-founder Bill Gates each donated $100,000 to the campaign in support as well. Starbucks, Nike, Inc., REI, Alcoa, Expedia, Inc., T-Mobile, Nordstrom, the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, and dozens of other businesses also supported the bill. United States President Barack Obama encouraged support as well.\n\nOpposition to the bill was coordinated largely by the National Organization for Marriage (NOM) and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Seattle, which encouraged support for rejecting the bill among all parishes. Parishes planned \"in-pew donations as part of what it is calling Preserve Marriage month\" and NOM was expected to bring in additional money from outside the state.\n\nSeveral newspapers in Washington state supported the bill, with the \"Seattle Times\" also launching an interactive social media campaign to encourage readers to support the bill publicly. Other endorsements included the \"Tacoma News-Tribune\", Spokane's \"The Spokesman-Review\", Vancouver's \"The Columbian\", \"Yakima Herald-Republic\", \"Tri-City Herald\", Everett's \"The Herald\", \"The Olympian\", \"The Wenatchee World\", and the \"Walla Walla Union-Bulletin\".\n\nReferendum 74 generated a large number of individual donations which may have surpassed the 2008 record of 13,500 for the Washington Death with Dignity Act. As of July 3, 2012, Referendum 74 sponsor Preserve Marriage Washington (seeking \"rejection\" votes) had reportedly raised $132,000, while Washington United for Marriage (seeking \"approval\" votes) raised $1.9 million. As of August, campaign-financing proponents showed a 13-to-1 fundraising advantage for same-sex marriage, but a National Organization for Marriage campaign director was confident that $4 million would appear as needed. A Public Disclosure Commission complaint has been filed, accusing both Preserve Marriage Washington and the National Organization for Marriage of having failed to report donations as required by law. As of October 5, 2012, proponents of Referendum 74 Washington United for Marriage have raised $9.4 million in donations and opponents Preserve Marriage Washington have raised about $1 million.\n\nVarious public opinion surveys of Washington residents asked questions regarding same-sex marriage. The questions vary, with some surveys referring directly to Referendum 74 and others asking more general questions. A post-election poll indicated much stronger support for such marriage among women than men across several categories.\n\nUpon certification, Secretary of State Sam Reed partially credited the referendum for encouraging voter turnout of 81%, the highest in the nation. County offices in King and Thurston counties opened at 12:01 a.m. after the measure was certified, with celebrations in support outside of several government offices, with various same-sex weddings scheduled, free of charge, beginning just after midnight on December 9, just after the mandatory three-day waiting period applying to all Washington weddings.\n\n\n\n"}

There has been an increase in women in the law field from the 1970s to 2010, but the increase has been seen in entry level jobs. In the United States, 60% of attorneys are women; however, the percent of female equity partners is 15%. Women of color are even more underrepresented in the legal profession. In private practice law firms, women make up just 4% of managing partners in the 200 biggest law firms. In 2014 in Fortune 500 corporations, 21% of the general counsels were women, of which only 10.5% were African-American, 5.7% were Hispanic, 1.9% were Asian-American/Pacific Islanders, and 0% were Middle Eastern. In 2009, 21.6% of law school Deans were women. Women held 27.1% of all federal and state judge positions in 2012. In the US, \"[w]omen of color were more likely than any other group to experience exclusion from other employees, racial and gender stereotyping.\" There are few women law school deans; the list includes Joan Mahoney, Barbara Aronstein Black at Columbia Law School, Elena Kagan at Harvard Law School, Kathleen Sullivan at Stanford Law School, and the Hon. Kristin Booth Glenn and Michelle J. Anderson at the City University of New York School of Law.\n\nIn Canada, while 37.1% of lawyers are women, \"50% ...said they felt their [law] firms were doing \"poorly\" or \"very poorly\" in their provision of flexible work arrangements.\" As well, \"...racialized women accounted for 16% of all lawyers under 30\" in 2006 in Ontario and women Aboriginal lawyers accounted for 1%.\n\nThe American Bar Association reported that in 2014, women made up 34% of the legal profession and men made up 66%. In private practice law firms, women make up 20.2% of partners, 17% of equity partners and 4% of managing partners in the 200 biggest law firms. At the junior level of the profession, women make up 44.8% of associates and 45.3% of summer associates. In 2014 in Fortune 500 corporations, 21% of the general counsels were women and 79% were men. Of these 21% of women general counsels, 81.9% were Caucasian, 10.5% were African-American, 5.7% were Hispanic, 1.9% were Asian-American/Pacific Islanders, and 0% were Middle Eastern. In 2009, women were 21.6% of law school Deans, 45.7% of Associate, Vice-Deans or Deputy Deans and 66.2% of Assistant Deans. Women have better representation on law school Law Reviews. In the top 50 schools as ranked by \"US World and News Reports\" in 2012-2013, women made up 46% of leadership positions and 38% of editor-in-chief positions.\n\nIn 2012, women held 27.1% of all federal and state judge positions, while men held 73.9%. In 2014, three of nine Supreme Court justices were women (33%), 33% of Circuit Court of Appeals judges and 24% of federal court judges. Women held 27% of all state judge positions.\n\nDuring the 2012-2013 academic year, women made up 47% of Juris Doctor (JD) students, people of color made up 25.8% of JD students. In 2009 in the US, women made up 20.6% of law school deans. In the US in 2014, 32.9% of all lawyers were women. 44.8% of law firm associates were women in 2013. In the 50 \"best law firms for women\" in the US, \"19% of the equity partners were women,\n29% of the nonequity partners were women, and 42% of... counsels were women.\n\nA survey indicates that 96% of US law firms state that their highest paid partner is male. \n\"Only 24.1% of all federal judgeships were held by women, and only 27.5% of state judgeships were held by women.: Women lawyers' salaries were \"83% of men lawyers’ salaries in 2014\".\n\nIn 2010 in Canada, \"there were 22,261 practicing women lawyers and 37,617 practicing men lawyers.\" Canadian studies show that \"50% of lawyers said they felt their firms were doing \"poorly\" or \"very poorly\" in their provision of flexible work arrangements.\" More women lawyers found it \"difficult to manage the demands of work and personal/family life\" than men, with 75% of women reporting these challenges versus 66% of men associates. A 2010 report about Ontario lawyers from 1971 to 2006 indicates that \"...racialized women accounted for 16% of all lawyers under 30, compared to 5% of lawyers 30 and older in 2006. Visible minority lawyers accounted for 11.5% of all lawyers in 2006. Aboriginal lawyers accounted for 1.0% of all lawyers in 2006.\n\nThe National Association for Law Placement (NALP) found that every year since 2009 there has been a decline of African-American associates—“from 4.66 percent to 3.95 percent.\" According to a November 2015 NALP press release, at just 2.55 percent of partners, minority women remain the most underrepresented group at partnership level.\n\nIn a 2008 survey, by the National Association of Women Lawyers (NAWL), the report found that women of color view their workplace as racially/ethnically stereotypical and exclusionary as a result. Women of color also felt that law firms were not taking enough action to increase diversity and when actions were taken they were not executed effectively. The America Bar Association Commission on Women in the Profession released a report which was a culmination of a study meant to address the decline of women of color in the legal profession. In the study, women of color were given the opportunity to express concern over the negative effects they faced in the workplace and how those effects carried into their personal life. Women of color reported feelings of exclusion, isolation, and as though they were receiving more unwanted critical attention than their counterparts. The American Bar Association Commission on Women in the Profession when looking at reports on the treatment of women of color in the legal profession were disappointed with the patterns they noticed which led the American Bar Association Commission on Women in the Profession to undertake their own research in 2003, the Women of Color Research Initiative. In both law firms and corporate legal departments the findings were that women of color “receive less compensation than men and white women; are denied equal access to significant assignments, mentoring and sponsorship opportunities; receive fewer promotions; and have the highest rate of attrition.” There is a ripple effect within the treatment of women of color. Women of color are put at a disadvantage early on making “the ultimate result that women of color miss opportunities to get better work assignments, more client contact, and more billable hours.” Women of color’s treatment within the legal profession and their feelings about this treatment have affected the retention of women of color in the legal profession. Women of color leave law firms at a high rate, “nearly 75 percent leave by their fifth year, and nearly 86 percent leave before their seventh year.\" These women are leaving because they feel the only way to escape exclusion in the workplace is to leave the workplace.\n\nABA's Commission on Women in the Profession released a report aimed at identifying challenges faced by women of color in law firms and found that “to overcome systemic discrimination against women of color, firms must recognize that the experiences of women of color are different from those of other groups; implementing changes to reflect this difference is necessary for retention. Firms and corporations must initiate active mentorship programs and encourage organization-wide discussions about issues concerning women of color, and constructive feedback is required.” After the release of this report, several law firms have attempted the recommendations set forth by the report. Law firms began initiatives that focus on recruiting women of color as well as ensuring the retention of women of color as well. Recruiting of minority women has been increased through law firms finding summer associates by doing interviews “at the Southeast Minority Career Fair, MCCA/Vault Career Fair, Specialty Bar Association, Lavender Law Career Fair, and at schools such as Howard University School of Law and North Carolina Central School of Law.”\n\nThe Center for Women in Law is a US organization set up and funded by women, says it is \"devoted to the success of the entire spectrum of women in law ... serves as a national resource to convene leaders, generate ideas, and lead change\". It combines theory with practice, addressing issues facing individuals and the profession as a whole. The Center is a Vision 2020 National Ally. The Center was founded in 2008 by a group of women, many of whom were alumnae of The University of Texas School of Law, and many of whom graduated from law school in earlier decades when it was not common for women to pursue law as a career. The group began discussing the issues faced by women lawyers and became determined to understand fully and address effectively the underlying causes of the barriers to advancement faced by women lawyers. The Austin Manifesto calls for specific, concrete steps to tackle the obstacles facing women in the legal profession today. The center holds summits and meetings on issues affecting women in the legal profession.\n\nThe National Women's Law Center (NWLC) is a United States non-profit organization founded in 1972 and based in Washington, D.C. The Center advocates for women's rights through litigation and policy initiatives. It began when female administrative staff and law students at the Center for Law and Social Policy demanded that their pay be improved, that the center hire female lawyers, that they no longer be expected to serve coffee, and that the center create a women's program. Marcia Greenberger was hired in 1972 to start the program and Nancy Duff Campbell joined her in 1978. In 1981, the two decided to turn the program into the separate National Women's Law Center.\n\nWomen's Legal Education and Action Fund, referred to by the acronym LEAF, is the \"...only national organization in Canada that exists to ensure the equality rights of women and girls under the law.\". Established on April 19, 1985, LEAF was formed in response to the enactment of Section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to ensure that there was fair and unbiased interpretation of women’s Charter rights by the courts. LEAF performs legal research and intervenes in appellate and Supreme Court of Canada cases on women's issues . LEAF has been an intervener in many significant decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada, particularly cases involving section 15 Charter challenges. In addition to its legal work, LEAF also organizes speaking engagements and projects that allow lawyers interested in women’s rights to educate one another, to educate the public, and to create collective responses to legal issues related to women’s equality. LEAF was created by founding mother Doris Anderson and other women.\n\nWomen in Law and Litigation (WILL) was formed in India in 2014 by women lawyers, judges and legal professionals to deal with gender discrimination faced by women in the field of law. The litigating public prefers to deal with male lawyers. The society was formed under the supervision of Supreme Court of India and the justice of Supreme Court of India, Ranjana Desai. WILL was formed to provide professional support, advocacy skills, and a platform for discussion on ways for development of women lawyers. \nJustice Hima Kohli of the High Court (Delhi) defined WILL as the society would be a \"way to give back to the system for senior lawyers and legal practitioners who have \"reached high positions\".\n\nFeminist legal theory, also known as feminist jurisprudence, is based on the belief that the law has been fundamental in women's historical subordination. The project of feminist legal theory is twofold. First, feminist jurisprudence seeks to explain ways in which the law played a role in women's former subordinate status. Second, it is dedicated to changing women's status through a reworking of the law and its approach to gender. In 1984 Martha Fineman founded the Feminism and Legal Theory Project at the University of Wisconsin Law School to explore the relationships between feminist theory, practice, and law, which has been instrumental in the development of feminist legal theory.\n\nThe liberal model of equality under the law operates from within the liberal legal paradigm and generally embraces liberal values and the rights-based approach to law, though it takes issue with how the liberal framework has operated in practice. The difference model emphasizes the significance of gender differences and holds that these differences should not be obscured by the law, but should be taken into account by it. The dominance model views the legal system as a mechanism for the perpetuation of male dominance. Feminists from the postmodern camp have deconstructed the notions of objectivity and neutrality, claiming that every perspective is socially situated. See equality feminism, difference feminism, radical feminism, and postmodern feminism for context.\n\nNotable scholars include:\n\nFeminist philosophy of law \"...identifies the pervasive influence of patriarchy on legal structures, demonstrates its effects on the material condition of women and girls, and develops reforms to correct gender injustice, exploitation, or restriction.\" Feminist philosophy of law uses approaches drawn from \"...feminist epistemology, relational metaphysics, feminist political theory, and other developments in feminist philosophy to understand how legal institutions enforce dominant masculinist norms.\" In the contemporary era, feminist philosophy of law also takes account of approaches such as \"...human rights theory, postcolonial theory, critical legal studies, critical race theory, queer theory, and disability studies.\" As with feminism in general, there are many subtypes of feminist philosophy of law, including \"...radical, socialist and Marxist, relational, cultural, postmodern, dominance, difference, pragmatist, and liberal approaches.\" Feminist philosophers of law argue that \"... law makes systemic bias (as opposed to personal biases of particular individuals) invisible, normal, entrenched, and thus difficult to identify and to oppose.\" Feminist philosophers of law view laws as \"...patriarchal, reflecting ancient and almost universal presumptions of gender inequality.\" Some of the legal issues analyzed by feminist philosophers of law include marriage, reproductive rights (e.g., pertaining to laws on abortion), the \"commodification of the body\" (as in sex work) and violence against women.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the first woman to pass a law degree was Eliza Orme, who graduated from University College London in 1888. She was not allowed to qualify to practice as either a solicitor or a barrister. It was not until 1919, with the passage of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 that women could enter the legal profession. This had been challenged in 1914 in a case known as \"Bebb v Law Society\", in which the Court of Appeal found that women did not fall within the legal definition of \"persons\" and so could not become lawyers. The 1919 Act also allowed women to serve on juries for the first time.\n\n\n\nAt the end of the nineteenth century, Canadian women were barred from participation in, let alone any influence on or control over, the legal system–women could not become lawyers, magistrates, judges, jurors, voters or legislators. Clara Brett Martin (1874 – 1923) became the first female lawyer in the British Empire in 1897 after a lengthy debate in which the Law Society of Upper Canada tried to prevent her from joining the legal profession. After graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1891, Martin submitted a petition to the Law Society to become a member. Her petition was rejected by the Society after contentious debate, with the Society ruling that only men could be admitted to the practice of law, because the Society's statute stated that only a \"person\" could become a lawyer. At that time, women were not considered to be \"persons\" in Canada, from a legal perspective. W.D. Balfour sponsored a bill that provided that the word \"person\" in the Law Society's statute should be interpreted to include females as well as males. Martin’s cause was also supported by prominent women of the day including Emily Stowe and Lady Aberdeen. With the support of the Premier, Oliver Mowat, legislation was passed on April 13, 1892, which permitted the admission of women as solicitors.\n\nHelen Kinnear (1894 – 1970) was a Canadian lawyer who was the first federally appointed woman judge in Canada. She was the first woman in the British Commonwealth to be created a King's Counsel and the first in the Commonwealth appointed to a county-court bench and the first female lawyer in Canada to appear as counsel before the Supreme Court in Canada in 1935. Marie-Claire Kirkland-Casgrain (born 1924) is a Quebec lawyer, judge and politician who was the first woman elected to the Legislative Assembly of Quebec, the first woman appointed a Cabinet minister in Quebec, the first woman appointed acting premier, and the first woman judge to serve in the Quebec Provincial Court. Marlys Edwardh CM (born 1950) is a Canadian litigation and civil rights lawyer who was one of the first women to practice criminal law in Canada. Roberta Jamieson C.M. is a Canadian lawyer and First Nations activist who was the first Aboriginal woman ever to earn a law degree in Canada, the first non-Parliamentarian to be appointed an \"ex officio\" member of a House of Commons committee and the first woman appointed as Ontario Ombudsman. Delia Opekokew is a Cree woman from the Canoe Lake First Nation in Saskatchewan, who was the first First Nations lawyer admitted to the law societies in Ontario and in Saskatchewan as well as the first woman ever to run for the leadership of the Assembly of First Nations. Opekokew graduated from Osgoode Hall in 1977, and was admitted to the Bar of Ontario in 1979 and to the Bar of Saskatchewan in 1983.\n\nBeverley McLachlin (born 1943) is the 17th and current Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada, the first woman to hold this position, and the longest serving Chief Justice in Canadian history. In her role as Chief Justice, she also serves as a Deputy of the Governor General of Canada. When Governor General Adrienne Clarkson was hospitalized for a cardiac pacemaker operation on 8 July 2005, Chief Justice McLachlin served as the Deputy of the Governor General of Canada and performed the duties of the Governor General as the Administrator of Canada. In her role as Administrator, she gave royal assent to the \"Civil Marriage Act\", effectively legalizing same-sex marriage in Canada.\n\nSome Canadian lawyers have become notable for their achievements in politics, including Kim Campbell, Mélanie Joly, Anne McLellan, Rachel Notley and Jody Wilson-Raybould.\n\nNotable Canadian legal professionals include:\n\n\n\n\n"}
