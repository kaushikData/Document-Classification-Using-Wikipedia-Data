It was previously based at Chennai.\n\nThe Animal Welfare Board of India was established in 1962 under Section 4 of The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act,1960. Well-known humanitarian Rukmini Devi Arundale was instrumental in setting up the board and was its first chair. The Board consists of 28 Members, who serve for a period of 3 years. Its headquarters was in Chennai, which moved to Ballabhgarh of Faridabad district in Haryana state in early 2018.\n\nThe Board was initially within the jurisdiction of the Government of India's Ministry of Food and Agriculture. In 1990, the subject of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was transferred to the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate change, where it now resides.\n\nConcerned about the abuse of animals in research, in the Board's early history, it recommended that the government create the Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA). The Committee was created, and the Board's representative Dr. S. Chinny Krishna deposed twice before the Committee about \"the dismal state of laboratories in India.\" \n\nA number of years passed before the subject was \"taken up effectively by the Government.\" In 2001, the government passed Rules covering the breeding and experimentation on animals.\n\nAnother early concern of the Board was the cruelty involved when animals were used in entertainment. In 1964, the Board published the booklet, \"Circuses - Amusement for the Uncivilised\". In 2001, the government passed the Performing Animals Rules, which were amended in 2005. In 2012, the Board reported that the Rules were being implemented in an effective way.\n\nSome of the functions of the Board include:\n\nThe Board oversees Animal Welfare Organisations (AWOs) by granting recognition to them if they meet its guidelines. The organisation must submit paperwork; agree to nominate a representative of the Animal Welfare Board of India on its Executive Committee; and to submit to regular inspections. After meeting the requirements and an inspection, the organisation is considered for grant of recognition. The AWBI also appoints key people to the positions of (Hon) Animal Welfare Officers, who serve as the key point of contact between the people, the government and law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe Board provides financial assistance to recognised Animal Welfare Organisations (AWOs), who submit applications to the Board. Categories of grants include Regular Grant, Cattle Rescue Grant, Provision of Shelter House for looking after the Animals, Animal Birth Control (ABC) Programme, Provision of Ambulance for the animals in distress and Natural Calamity grant.\nThe Board suggests changes to laws and rules about animal welfare issues. In 2011, a new draft Animal Welfare Act was published for comment. Guidance is also offered to organisations and officials such as police to help them interpret and apply the laws.\n\nThe Board issues publications to raise awareness of various animal welfare issues. The Board's Education Team gives talks on animal welfare subjects, and trains members of the community to be Board Certified Animal Welfare Educators.\n\n\n"}

In a broad sense it refers to the anti-monopoly legal system of China, including not only the AML, the post-AML ancillary legislative, and legal documents for the purpose of enforcing the AML, but also all pre-AML legislative and administrative documents with an anti-monopoly nature, as well as regulatory or administrative enforcement, private enforcement and judicial procedures. The definition used here refers to its broad meaning.\n\nIt is commonly recognized that the legislation of the anti-monopoly law in China was initiated in August 1987 when an AML drafting team was set up by the former Legal Affairs Bureau of the State Council to formally proceed to draft the AML. Prior to this, however, and following the economic reforms and opening in China, the State Council had already promulgated The Provisional Rules on Expediting Economic Alliance as early as 1 July 1980, aiming to “break down... territorial blockades and departmental barriers.” This was followed by The State Council Provisional Rules on the Launching and Protecting the Socialist Competition on 17 October 1980, aiming to “step by step reform the existing economic management system and actively promote and protect... smooth competition;\" a third document, the State Council Rules on Further Expediting and Protecting Socialist Competition, was released on 23 March 1986. These three documents served as the earliest form of anti-monopoly law and were intended to break down the historical planning of economic monopolies in the pre-1980’s era and to promote the initial and basic market economy and competition.\n\nSince August 1987 onward, the significant milestones of anti-monopoly law legislation in China are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe basic structure and framework of the anti-monopoly law of China up to date include the following legislations and the implementing legal documents (the box at the top contains the post-AML ancillary legal documents, the box in the middle contains the pre-AML laws and legal documents which are still in force, while the box at the bottom contains those laws and legal documents that are still in the processes of either drafting or soliciting opinion):\n\nThe doctrines of “\"illegal per se rule\"” (“\"per se rule\"”) and the “\"rule of reason\"” are two landmark and the most important legal theories in the history and development of the anti-trust law not only in its country of origin but also in many other countries and jurisdictions all over the world. The doctrines make a clear and straight definition in legal theory and can be efficiently and effectively implemented in practical enforcement. The fact that the doctrines in the United States have directly, effectively and successfully regulated the market situation and competitive practices, protected and promoted the market competition, and the anti-trust legal theory and practice have been consistently evolving and developing to cope with the market, economic and competition development, makes the doctrines significantly influential in the competition law legislation and enforcement in other countries and jurisdictions.\n\nLiterally, the doctrines of “per se rule” and the “rule of reason” can be found in the AML context as well as in the Supreme Court Judicial Opinion on one hand, but it is found otherwise in several court judgement on the other hand.\n\nDuring the processes of the AML legislation, the AML drafting team had not only studied and referenced to the greatest extent the statues of the EU competition law legislation as a result the basic structure and contents of the AML are as close and similar as the EU competition law, but had also studied the US antitrust legal theory and cases and consulted the US antitrust law experts. As such, the spirit of the doctrines of “\"per se rule\"” and the “\"rule of reason\"” indeed exists or influences the creation of the AML.\n\nIn the legislation, as far as the literal provisions of the AML is concerned, it is found that Articles 13 (horizontal agreement), 14 (vertical Agreement) and 17(1) (abuse of dominant market position) as one category using the literal word \"prohibit\" without any pre condition, while there is a condition of \"reasonable cause\" for the \"prohibition\" in Articles 17(2) to (6) (abuse of dominant market position without justifiable cause) as another category, as a result making literal difference that there should be different legislative purposes and intents as well as different legal meanings in the AML between the above two categories: with regard to the unconditional prohibition in the first category on one hand, any agreement or conduct breaching unconditional prohibition will then constitute a violation of law without regard to the result or effect caused by the violation, as such these unconditional prohibitions can be treated or argued to have the nature or character of \"\"illegal per se\" and accordingly it is an alternative expression of \"illegal per se rule\"\" in the AML; while with regard to Articles 17(2) to (6), on the other hand, the literal words \"reasonable cause\", given its obvious literal meaning, will then be an alternative expression of the \"\"rule of reason\".\n\nIn the judicial opinion, however, unlike the EU Court of First Instance in Case T-112/99 M6 and Others v Commission has expressly denied the existence of \"rule of reason\" in the EU competition law, China Supreme Court by far has yet clearly clarified and it has been hesitating in its Judicial Opinions on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Law in Proceeding Civil Cases Caused by Monopolistic Conducts (Fa Shi [2012] No. 5) (hereinafter the “SCJO”) if the \"illegal per se rule\" and the \"rule of reason\" exists in the anti-monopoly legal system of China or can be invoked in the practical enforcement cases or not, in other words, it still remains unclear if Articles 13, 14 and 17(1) as one category would have the nature of \"illegal per se\" and only Articles 17(2) to (6) as another category subject to the \"rule of reason\"\", or if there is any different legislative purpose and intent and different legal meaning or not between the two categories. As a result, also unlike the EU Court of First Instance in the same Case T-112/99 that has clearly stated that the pro- or anti-competition aspects should be examined within the scope of Article 85(3) of the EU Treaty, otherwise “Article 85(3) of the Treaty would lose much of its effectiveness if such an examination had to be carried out already under Article 85(1) of the Treaty”, China Supreme Court has further left unclear if the \"reasonable cause\" provided in Articles 17(2) to (6) is limited to the pre-set scope in Article 15 or all relevant pro- or anti-competition aspects of undertaking and the relevant market can be taken into account and examined according to the doctrine of \"\"rule of reason\"\".\n\nIn the Supreme Court Judicial Oipnions on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Law in Proceeding Anti-Monopoly Civil Dispute Cases (Soliciting Comment Version) Circulated by the China Supreme Court on 25 April 2011 (hereinafter the “SCJO SCV”), unlike in the literal provisions of the AML, it seems to draw no distinction as between Articles 13, 14 and 17(1) as one category Articles 17(2) to (6) as another category as initially drafted as in Article 8 of the SCJO : “The victims of the monopoly agreements shall have burden of proof against the alleged monopoly agreements for the effects of the exclusion or restriction of competition. The victims shall not have burden of proof against such monopoly agreements for the effects of the exclusion or restriction of competition if the monopoly agreements fall within the scope of \"Articles 13(1) to (5)\" or \"Articles 14(1) and (2)\", except for if the alleged undertakings to the said monopoly agreements are able to prove otherwise by the contrary evidence.” which could be read as that both Articles 13(1) to (5) or Articles 14(1) and (2) are subject to effect examination (\"rule of reason\").\n\nIn the official SCJO, however, Article 7 of the SCJO merely provides that “the defendant shall have burden of proof for no effect of exclusion and restriction of competition for acts falling within the monopoly agreements under Articles 13(1) to (5)”, which draws an obvious distinction between the formally equal Article 13, per se illegal unless defendant proves otherwise, and Article 14, subject to plaintiff’s burden of proof on effect (or rule of reason) examination. Article 8 of the SCJO also seems to have drawn an unclear distinguish on burden of proof between Article 17(1) from Articles 17(2) to (6) by saying “plaintiff shall [only] have burden of proof for the dominant position, and the abuse of such dominant position by the defendant in the relevant market”, alleged defendant monopoly conduct will be justified unless plaintiff proves illegal by effect examination (or rule of reason); this Article 8 seems to make AML Article 17(1) equal to Articles 17(2) to (6) that both are subject to the effect examination.\n\nThis topic, especially as to if there is any difference between Articles 13 and 14, remained unclear until the Ruibang vs. J&J case that Shanghai High Court made a very judgement on 1 August 2013 in which including an analysis on the interrelations between AML Articles 13 and 14. Shanghai High Court examined and concluded that “the effects of exclusion and restriction of competition are the constitutive and necessary factors in the examination of monopoly agreement with clause of restricting the minimum resale price as referred to in Article 14 of the AML”. From this ruling and the position that Shanghai High Court allowed both plaintiff and defendant to submit and cross examine the reports prepared by the economic experts on the relevant markets, J&J’s products and its market share, the effects of pro- and anti-competition of the alleged vertical agreement in question with restriction on the minimum resale price, etc., it appears that Shanghai High Court is rather in favour of agreeing to conduct a comprehensive examination of all related aspects in particular of the pro- and anti-competition effects of \"Article 14 agreements\" in accordance with the doctrine of the “rule of reason”.\n\nNonetheless the above, however, in the administrative enforcement, it appears that the NDRC is rather apt to apply the doctrine of “illegal per se rule” directly to the first category (i.e., AML Articles 13, 14 and 17(1)) because of the low difficulty and costs and easy proceeding to apply the “per se rule” in the administrative enforcement of the AML. This is evidenced by the most recent four major cases that NDRC announced during January to August 2013 because neither examination nor analysis on the “reason” or “reasonable cause” had ever been made to the effects of restriction or exclusion of competition by the alleged monopolistic conducts. Albeit this has been questioned, NDRC appears to follow and carry on the strategy and tactics that were adopted in the US in the early stage of the enforcement of Sherman Act at the turn of 19th and 20th centuries to put a direct “\"illegal per se\"” effect to the AML Articles 13 and 14. This makes very important sense because it is drawing a boundary line as between the “\"illegal per se\"” conducts and agreement and those conducts and agreement with “reasonable cause”.\n\nIn a summary, until the Supreme Court clearly interprets this important issue by further judicial opinions or rulings, whether or not the unconditional prohibition in Articles 13 and 14 would equally have similar nature of \"illegal per se\" and how to distinguish Articles 13 and 14 them from the \"reasonable cause\" in Articles 17(2) to (6), still remain an open topic in the anti-monopoly legal system in China.\n\nThe AML adopts in Article 15 the same doctrine of “legal applicable exceptions” as in Article 81(3) of the EU Treaty. Unlike the EU competition law that the EU Commission has promulgated and implemented various specific regulations for the purpose of implementing and enforcing Article 81(3), however, several fundamental issues such as the specific contents and criteria of the “legal exceptions”, who has the authority or being authorized to stipulate the implementing rules, by the NPC Standing Committee, the State Council, or the NDRC or SAIC, still remain unclear in the anti-monopoly legal system. In private enforcement, the contents and criteria of the proof of evidences for “reasonable cause” and whether the assessment and comparison between pro-competition vs. anti-competition are limited within the preset scope of AML Article 15 only or can include all reasonable causes in all relevant aspects or elements beyond AML Article 15, also remain unclear.\n\nThere is no precedent case law in China. The judgements, especially those methodological or judicial examinations in the judicial rulings or opinions made by the high court or the Supreme Court in the landmark cases, are commonly studied by law practitioners, academic researchers and sometimes indirectly as a principle or guideline invoked by other courts in the subsequent cases.\n\nIn 2011, Huawei brought two separate litigations against the same group of defendants of Inter Digital Corporation, Inc. and its affiliated companies (IDC). The first case was brought to Shenzhen Intermediate Court for the judicial ruling on the royalty rate by Huawei to IDC for certain patent licenses ([2011] Shen Zhong Fa Zhi Min Chu Zi No. 857, Case 857) and the second on was also brought to Shenzhen Intermediate Court for damages caused by IDC’s abuse of dominant market position ([2011] Shen Zhong Fa Zhi Min Chu Zi No. 858, Case 858). Both cases were appealed to the Guangdong Provincial High Court.Guangdong Provincial High Court made the final judgement on the first Huawei v. IDC case (Case No. 857) On 16 October 2013 ([2013] Yue Gao Fa Min San Zhong Zi No 305, Judgement 305) and on the second one (Case 858) on 21 October 2013 ([2013] Yue Gao Fa Min San Zhong Zi No 306, Judgement 306). Upon the petition of both Huawei and IDC, both cases were not publicly heard due to the large amount of sensitive commercial and technical information and dada.\n\nThe two judgements made by Guangdong High Court are published in which all sensitive information and data are redacted. Both cases and the two judgements, usually treated as one combined case by Huawei against IDC, have been appraised by the China Courts as one of the best 10 AML cases by then, while commented by the public as very controversial. The following can be considered:\n\n(1) In Judgement 305 (Case 857): there is an extremely lack of (1) judicial analysis to justify and support the ruling on choices of Chinese law and the forum jurisdiction of the China court in a royalty rate case arising from, or at least substantially depending on the interpretation of, royalty policy and rules of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute ETSI, which is organized and governed by French law; (2) legal grounds under the current Chinese law on the [discretionary] right of the court in determining a non-tort (or infringement), non-breach of contract, but a pure commercial term as well as its other judicial rulings.\n\n(2) On 14 April 2014, IDC filed a petition to the China Supreme Court for retrial and seeking a dismissal of this judgement or at least a higher, market-based royalty rate. It is currently pending with China Supreme Court.\n\n(3) In Judgement 306 (Case 858), this is rather an “abuse of intellectual property right” case under AML Article 55 than an “abuse of dominant market position” case under AML Article 17, Guangdong High Court finally upheld the initial judgement to judge IDC to compensate Huawei RMB20 millions. this final Ruling covered two AML aspects both of which are not only jurisprudence important but also leading edge. The first aspect is the “extraterritoriality” under AML Article 2, while the second aspect is that the Ruling appears to make use of the “abuse of dominant market position” under AML Article 17 for the “abuse of intellectual property right” case under AML Article 55. (1) AML Article 2 is itself too general and vague which merely empowers the right and offers possibility to apply “extraterritorial jurisdiction”. As to how to apply such “extraterritorial jurisdiction”, the detailed rules, conditions and criteria in the application, neither AML nor the Supreme Court has yet made any clear implementing regulations, interpretation or guideline, but would rather merely rely on the discretionary power of the competent court. Taking these into account in conjunction with the complicated factors of either or both private and public international laws that may be associated with the application of “extraterritorial jurisdiction” as well as that many other courts may possibly follow after this Ruling to apply the “extraterritorial jurisdiction” in other cases, it appears to be desirable and urgent for the Supreme Court to make judicial ruling as to how to appropriately and delicately apply the “extraterritorial jurisdiction”. (2) Because this Ruling may be a modeling precedent of making use of the “abuse of dominant market position” under AML Article 17 for the “abuse of intellectual property right” case under AML Article 55 or even it is merely an “abuse of dominant market position” case involving intellectual property right elements, how to treat and balance the prohibition of “abuse of intellectual property right” verse the lawful proprietary, exclusive or monopolistic right of the intellectual property right as well as verse the legal exception of application of the AML provided in the same AML Article 55, and how to treat the anti-monopoly provisions provided by the AML verse the lawful proprietary, exclusive or monopolistic right of the intellectual property right provided by intellectual property laws such as Patent Law, all of such complicated and delicate issues remain unclear and uncertain pending the Supreme Court judicial opinion, in order to not only protect competition and prohibit monopoly but also to protect the intellectual property right as well as its lawful proprietary, exclusive or monopolistic right.\n\nNDRC, upon Huawei’s petition (or informant), launched the formal AML investigation against IDC in June 2013. With the high pressure from the NDRC, IDC eventually reached a private settlement with NDRC by making certain commitments leading to NDRC withdrawing the investigation in May 2014. It is widely believed that both courts (of Shenzhen Municipality and Guangdong Province) and NDRC played both judicial and administrative sticks against IDC to support Huawei’s launching and development in the US market.\n\nThis is the first judicial case and judgement of vertical monopoly agreement under AML Article 14.2, as well as the first case that the High Court (of appeal) overruled the judgement in favour of the defendant made by the Intermediate Court (of first instance).\n\nThe fact of the case is simple and straightforward: Ruibang Yonghe Technology Co., Ltd. (\"Ruibang\"), the plaintiff in this case, is an authorized distributor of Johnson & Johnson (Shanghai) Medical Equipment Co., Ltd. and Johnson & Johnson (China) Medical Equipment Co., Ltd. (\"J&J\"), the defendants in the case, in the authorized territory under a distribution agreement. Ruibang sued J&J to the Shanghai Pudong New District Court for J&J's partially withdraw of Ruibang's distributorship, taking off Ruibang's distributor deposit and eventually refusing to supply by reason of Ruibang's breach of lowest re-sell price in the unauthorized territory. Both courts (of first instance and appeal) made similar judicial analysis in term of AML Article 14.2, Shanghai New District Court made a judgement on 18 May 2012 (Judgement (2010) Hu Yi Zhong Min Wu (Zhi) Chi Zi No 169) in favour of J&J on the ground of plaintiff's insufficient evidence. Ruibang appealed to the Shanghai High Court and submitted a very comprehensive expert affidavit made by a professor of China Foreign Economic and Trade University, as a defending fight back J&J also submitted the a comprehensive expert affidavit made by a professor of Shanghai Finance and Economic University. The Shanghai High Court conclusively made a judgement on 1 August 2013 (Judgement (2012) Hu Gao Min San (Zhi) Zhong Zi No 63) that overruled the judgement made by the Shanghai Pudong New District Court ruling that J&J had violated AML Article 14.2 and be liable for the judged damages.\n\nThis case and its final judgement offer some observation:\n\n(1) Under the AML, the vertical agreement is subject to “rule of reason”, namely, it is not “per se illegal” but very likely “per se challengeable” and “effect” test is necessary to assess if a vertical agreement breaches the AML, or not.\n\n(2) Four elements in the “effect” test: (1) sufficient competition, (2) market position, (3) motivation, and (4) effects of competition restriction and competition promotion.\n\n(3) The application of the doctrine of maxim semper necessitas probandi incumbit ei qui agit in the AML private enforcement case.\n\nThis is a case of the “abuse of dominant market position”, the first AML private enforcement case that was initially brought to and examined by the provincial High Court, then appealed to and finally judged by the Supreme Court, and by far, the Supreme Court’s written judgement is the best and most professional, both judicially and technically, judicial judgement of its kind ever amongst all AML cases in China. Given the judicial power and nature of the Supreme Court, this judgement established and reaffirmed several very important judicial rules with precedent case law effect insofar as the private enforcement of AML is concerned.\n\nThese important judicial rules include:\n\n(1) reaafirms the doctrine of semper necessitas probandi incumbit ei qui agit (he who alleges must prove) with regard to the allocation of onus probandi (burden of proof) in the AML judicial case\n\n(2) defining relevant market is not a purpose but instead rather a methodology in assessing the relevant undertaking’s market power and the influence power of the alleged monopoly conduct on to the competition, as such it is not compulsory to specifically and exactly define the relevant market in every AML litigation of abuse of dominant market position\n\n(3) an HMT (hypothetical monopoly test) based on tools of SSNIP (small but significant and non-transitory increase in price) or SSNDQ (small but significant and non-transitory decrease in quality) may be conducted in defining the relevant market but should be conducted carefully with cautious\n\n(4) the related market situation and technology development trend post the litigation may be taken into consideration in defining the relevant market\n\n(5) market share is not the only one element in concluding dominant market position\n\n(6) multi elements should be comprehensively evaluated in defining the dominant market position, including but not limited to: (1) the market share of the undertaking in question and the competition situation of the said market; (2) the control ability of the undertaking in question in the said market; (3) the financial and technical status of the undertaking in question; (4) the degree of dependence of other undertakings on the undertaking in question; and (5) the degree of difficulty to access to the relevant markey by other undertakings\n\n(7) if the relevant market is clearly defined and the alleged undertaking does not have dominant market position, normally it is not necessary to conduct an abuse behavior analysis and it can be directly concluded that such undertaking did not have abuse behavior; however, if neither the boundary of the relevant market nor the dominant market position of the alleged undertaking is clear or if the alleged undertaking had dominant market position, “effect examination” may be carried out so as to determine if the alleged conduct was lawful or not\n\n(8) the “tie-in” under the AML is illegal if it meets all of these criteria: (1) the base product and the “tie-in” product are independent to each other, (2) the undertaking has dominant market position in the base product market, (3) certain enforcement implemented upon the buyer who became lack of other options but to accept the tie-in product, (4) the tie-in could not be justified, was contrary to the commercial or consumer practice or ignored the functionalities of the products, and (5) the tie-in gave rise to negative effect to the competition\n\n(9) if an undertaking successfully proved the alleged monopoly conduct was justifiable under AML does not mean such undertaking has automatically and same successfully proved the monopoly conduct has not caused negative effect of exclusion or restriction of competition.\n\n7.1 It is commonly known and recognized that the investment by foreign investors in the form of M&A (including concentration of undertakings) is subject to the government approval in China which is mainly compromising of the following three parts in accordance with the relevant PRC laws and regulations:\n\n7.2 In which the thresholds and roadmap for the AML Notification and Review insofar as related to the concentration of undertakings can be summarized as follows:\n7.3 As far as the security review is concerned, according to the related laws and regulations concerning security review, such review may be a separate procedure with regard to the foreign investment in China, but may also be a part of or post-AML notification and review procedures for the foreign investment in China. The procedures and roadmap of the security review can be summarized as follows:\n\n7.4 The Legal Liabilities for the violation of the AML concerning the concentration of undertakings are summarized as follows:\n\n8.1 Under the AML, the hierarchy of the China anti monopoly enforcement and regulatory authorities is as follows:\n\n8.2 In accordance with the State Council General Office Notice regarding the State Council Anti Monopoly Committee’s Key Responsibilities and Members (Guo Ban Fa [2008] No 104), The State Council Anti Monopoly Committee was established on 28 July 2008, whose key responsibilities include: research and draft competition policy, organizing to investigate and evaluate the general market competition situation and publish the evaluation report, produce and promulgate ant monopoly guidelines, coordinate the anti monopoly enforcement, as well as other duties stipulated by the State Council.

A divided Court (5-4) held that it was not.\n\nBauer & Cie, a German company, was the assignee of U.S. Patent No. 601,995, covering Sanatogen, a water-soluble drug product (patent medicine), advertised as the \"King of Tonics\" and a strength-giving \"concentrated scientific food.\" Bauer sold the patented product in the United States through its exclusive sales agent, Hehmeyer, under a license agreement. Sanatogen was sold with this notice on each bag:\nNotice to the Retailer.\nThis size package of Sanatogen is licensed by us for sale and use at a price not less than one dollar ($1.00).

The Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia certified the case to the Supreme Court with this question:\n\nDid the Acts of the appellee [O'Donnell] in retailing at less than the price fixed in said notice on original packages of \"Sanatogen\" purchased of jobbers, as aforesaid, constitute infringement of appellants' patent?\n\nJustice William R. Day delivered the majority opinion, joined by Justices White, Hughes, Lamar, Pitney. Justices McKenna, Holmes, Lurton, and Van Devanter dissented without opinion.\n\nThe Court restated the question before it as:\nThe question therefore now before this Court for judicial determination, is: may a patentee, by notice, limit the price at which future retail sales of the patented article may be made, such article being in the hands of a retailer by purchase from a jobber who has paid to the agent of the patentee the full price asked for the article sold?\n\nThe patentee argued that the purpose of the restrictive notice was \"to prevent ruinous competition by the cutting of prices in sales of the patented article.\" Day responded, however, that absent a patent the Court had held resale price fixing unlawful in \"Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park & Sons Co.\" And Congress could, if it had wanted to, have conferred on patentees the right to impose such restrictions. He then asked:\n\nHas it done so? The question has not been determined in any previous case in this Court, so far as we are aware. It was dealt with under the copyright statute, however, in the case of \"Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus\".\n\nIn the \"Bobbs-Merrill\" case the Court held that the copyright was exhausted by the first sale, and:\n\n[I]t was not the purpose of the law to grant the further right to qualify the title of future purchasers by means of the printed notice affixed to the book, and that to give such right would extend the statute beyond its fair meaning and secure privileges not intended to be covered by the Act of Congress.\n\nThe Court recognized that \"there are differences between the copyright statute and the patent statute, and the purpose to decide the question now before us was expressly disclaimed\" in \"Bobbs–Merrill\". Nonetheless, \"it is apparent that, in the respect involved in the present inquiry, there is a strong similarity between and identity of purpose in the two statutes.\" Both statutes grant an exclusive right to \"vend.\" There is no difference of importance in the respective legal rights to vend books and vend products:\n\nSo far as the use of the terms \"vend\" and \"vending\" is concerned, the protection intended to be secured is substantially identical. The sale of a patented article is not essentially different from the sale of a book. In each case, to vend is to part with the thing for a consideration.\n\nThe patentee here insists that the purpose of notices fixing resale prices, specifically \"keeping up prices and preventing competition\"—is more essential to the protection of patented goods than of copyrighted books. The Court expressed doubt that this was so, but in any case it was more likely that \"Congress had no intention to use the term 'vend' in one sense in the patent act and . . . in another in the copyright law.\" Congress intended to provide \"[p}rotection in the exclusive right to sell . . . in both instances, and the terms used in the statutes are to all intents the same.\"\nThe only significant difference is that patent law gives an exclusive right to use and copyright law does not. The Supreme Court decision involving a post-sale restraint on which the patentee places chief reliance here is \"Henry v. A.B. Dick Co.\" But that decision was based on the exclusive \"use\" right:\n\n[T]he restriction was sustained because of the right to \"use\" the machine granted in the patent statute, distinguishing in that respect the patent from the copyright act. In that case, a patented mimeograph had been sold which bore an inscription in the form of a notice that the machine was sold with the license restriction that it might only be \"used\" with stencil, ink, and other supplies made by the A. B. Dick Company, the owners of the patent. The alleged infringer sold to the purchaser of the mimeograph a can of ink suitable for \"use\" with machine, with full knowledge of the restriction, and with the expectation that the ink sold would be \"used\" in connection with the machine.\n\nHere, the patentee has argued \"that the notice in this case deals with the use of the invention, because the notice states that the package is licensed 'for sale and use at a price not less than $1,' [and] that a purchase is an acceptance of the conditions. . .\" But, the Court insisted:\n\n[I]t is a perversion of terms to call the transaction in any sense a license to use the invention. The jobber from whom the appellee [O'Donnell] purchased had previously bought, at a price which must be deemed to have been satisfactory, the packages of Sanatogen afterwards sold to the appellee. The patentee had no interest in the proceeds of the subsequent sales, no right to any royalty thereon, or to participation in the profits thereof. The packages were sold with as full and complete title as any article could have when sold in the open market, excepting only the attempt to limit the sale or use when sold for not less than $1. In other words, the title transferred was full and complete, with an attempt to reserve the right to fix the price at which subsequent sales could be made. . . There was no transfer of a limited right to use this invention, and to call the sale a license to use is a mere play upon words.\n\nAs in \"Bobbs-Merrill Co v. Straus\", with copyright, the Court ruled, restrictions could not be extended beyond the terms of the statute, which grants an exclusive right to vend but grants no \"privilege to keep up prices and prevent competition by notices restricting the price at which the article may be resold.\" When the right to vend is exercised, patent rights are exhausted:\n\nThis being so, the case is brought within that line of cases in which this Court, from the beginning, has held that a patentee who has parted with a patented machine by passing title to a purchaser has placed the article beyond the limits of the monopoly secured by the patent act. [As in] \"Adams v. Burke\", . . . in the essential nature of things, when the patentee, or the person having his rights, sells a machine or instrument whose sole value is in its use, he receives the consideration for its use and he parts with the right to restrict that use. The article, in the language of the court, passes without the limit of the monopoly.\n\n● A contemporary Note in the \"Michigan Law Review\" said the case \"was of vital importance to a large number of manufacturers,\" as was \"evidenced by the various ingenious methods and devices which have since been adopted by numerous manufacturers to avoid the operation and application of the principles set forth in the decision,\" such as leasing and agency. The writer was surprised that \"The tendency of the Supreme Court seems to be to take the view that the monopoly enjoyed by the patentee was not meant by Congress to be without limitation, and consequently to make it practically impossible for the patentee to control the retail price.\"\n\nThe writer maintains: \"This decision by the Supreme Court was unquestionably a very great surprise to many, as it is not only directly in conflict with an almost unbroken line of decisions of the inferior federal courts,\" beginning with the \"Button-Fastener\" case, and \"it is also nearly impossible to reconcile this decision\" with \"Henry v. A. B. Dick Co.\" As for the \"Dick\" case, the writer continues, \"It was generally thought that in the \"Dick\" case the Supreme Court had expressly committed itself to the doctrine that the patentee could require the user to comply with any conditions which he might choose to impose.\" He considers the distinction drawn with that case to be flimsy and not \"clear, sound, or convincing.\"\n\n● A contemporary Note in the \"California Law Review\" also observed that in light of the \"A.B. Dick\" decision it was natural \"that some slight surprise should be occasioned by the decision of the Supreme Court in the so-called Sanatogen case which holds that a patentee is without right to make or enforce a resale price stipulation.\" More accurately than the Michigan note, this note attributed the see-sawing in recent years to the changes in the personnel of a closely divided Court and successive replacements by new Roosevelt, Taft, and Wilson appointees:\n\nIt is of decided interest to note that the four justices who constituted the majority of the court in the \"Dick\" case, dissented from the decision of the \"Sanatogen\" case. Of the five justices who formed the majority in the latter decision, three had vigorously dissented in \"Henry v. Dick Company\"; the other two justices took no part in the determination of the earlier case. Whether there be a valid ground of distinction between the two cases or not, the results reached would seem to be best accounted for by the difference in the personnel of the court. The law on this and other simiIar questions in regard to a patentee's rights is apparently in a state of some uncertainty, and the presence or absence of certain justices would seem to be an important factor in the determination of any case which might arise in the future.\n\n● Granville Munson, in a 1917 article on post-sale restraints, found the \"A.B. Dick\" and \"Bauer\" cases irreconcilable: \"It is submitted the \"Sanatogen\" case and the \"Dick\" case cannot both be upheld, although the court professes to distinguish the latter.\" He i9nsisted that the exclusive right to \"vend\" must include the right to set terms and conditions on which the patented article will be vended, and not just the right to sell or not sell: \"If the word, \"vend,\" is to have any particular meaning in the patent law, it is submitted it must be taken to refer to the conditions which may be imposed on subsales.\" Munson therefore concludes that \"the decision in \"Bauer & Cie v. O'Donnell\" should not be supported.\"\n\n● Charles Miller was critical of the Court's decision to suppress Bauer's resale price fixing:\n\nThe principal argument of those opposed to price maintenance among retailers, in legislative committees, and on the bench, is that after one has parted with title to an article, he should not be allowed further to control it. That idea seems to underlie the recent enunciations of the Supreme Court . . . The fallacy in this argument is that the manufacturer's interest in his product does not end with the transfer of title to the dealer, but follows the article into the hands of the ultimate consumer or user. His business life is dependent upon the public's being able to buy his article everywhere at a uniform price, and always of the same quality. Cut price sales will speedily and surely decrease the sale of his product; and if he is able to survive the loss of business, the manufacturer will be forced to reduce the quality of his article. One dealer advertising a so-called \"cut price\" sale invariably causes other dealers to cut below him in retaliation, with the result that all dealers in the community are forced to sell the particular article at a price which yields no profit. It hardly need be said they will not long continue to handle an article at a loss; so the market for the article is killed in that community, not because the people want the \"just-as-good\" substitute, nor because the quality of the article has been lowered, nor because the standard price is exorbitant, but because a business parasite used the good name of a popular article to deceive the. public into believing he sold everything below cost.\n\nHe added:\n\nThe price cutter is not a philanthropist, lie is a robber, stealing the advertising and filching the good will of another's product; and like all thieves he does not share his booty with the public. \"I cannot believe\", said Mr. Justice Holmes in his strong dissent in the \"Dr. Miles Case,\" \"that in the long run the public will profit by this court permitting knaves to cut reasonable prices for some ulterior purpose of their own, and thus to impair, if not destroy, the production and sale of articles which it is assumed to be desirable that the public should be able to get.\"\n\n\n"}

Blue Ridge Rural Electric Cooperative, Inc.\n\nByrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Electric Cooperative, Inc., 356 U.S. 525 (1958), decided on May 19, 1958, was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States that refined the doctrine regarding in what instances courts were required to follow state law.\n\nElectric power utility company Blue Ridge Rural Electric Cooperative, Inc., the defendant in this case, provided electric power to subscribers in rural South Carolina. James Earl Byrd, the plaintiff, was employed by R. H. Bouligny, Inc., an independent contractor. Bouligny had a $334,300 contract with Blue Ridge to construct 24 miles of new power lines, the reconversion to higher capacities of about 88 miles of existing lines, and the construction of two new substations and a breaker station. Byrd touched a live wire and suffered injuries while connecting power lines to one of the new substations. He brought a claim against his employer, Bouligny, and collected workmen's compensation, his guaranteed but only remedy for work-related injuries under state law. Byrd then proceeded to bring an action in diversity against Blue Ridge in the District Court for the Western District of South Carolina. Byrd was a resident of the state of North Carolina and Blue Ridge was a South Carolina corporation. Byrd sought damages for injuries allegedly caused by Blue Ridge's negligence. At issue was South Carolina's Workmen's Compensation Act that held that the employees of subcontractors are considered employees of the contractor for the purposes of the Act if, but only if, they perform work that is part of the contractor's trade or business. Additionally, the local judicial interpretation of the Act held that it was a question of law, not fact whether a workman was an employee under the statute, thus to be decided by a judge, not a jury. Byrd argued that the work that Bouligny, Inc. was performing (building electric substations) was not part of Blue Ridge's \"trade or business.\" At trial the judge entered judgment for Byrd (agreeing with the plaintiff that substations are not a part of trade or business, as the use of the substations was purely internal, and trade or business required work for someone else). The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed and directed judgment for Blue Ridge. The Supreme Court granted certiorari.\n\nThe question is whether the cause of action brought by the plaintiff is covered by the South Carolina Workmen's Compensation Act and therefore whether the plaintiff is barred from any other remedy against his employer in connection with the events at issue in this case. The Court, in a majority opinion by Justice William Brennan, first discussed whether the issue should be decided by a jury or by a court, as is the practice (and common law) in South Carolina. The Court notes that while in South Carolina the court decided the question, the rule is not bound up with the definitions and rights of the parties, being purely a practical consideration with irrelevant historic causes, a custom. The Court then addressed the outcome determinative test of York. The Court reasoned that if reaching the same outcome were the only consideration then the federal court would have to follow state practice. However, in addition to the outcome-determinative test of York the federal courts should consider any countervailing federal policies. In this case, following the state practice would disrupt the federal system of allocating functions between judges and juries and go against \"the influence - if not the command - of the Seventh Amendment\" (that guarantees the right of a trial by jury in suits at common law). Thus the Court found that the possibility of a different outcome was less important than perverting the judge-jury function allocations in the American federal system. Brennan concluded that there is no certainty or even a strong possibility that a different outcome would necessarily result if the issue is decided by a jury, mentioning numerous powers federal judges have (including making judgments notwithstanding the verdict.)\n\n\"There was considerable difficulty in applying the Byrd test.. [that] stem[med] from the fact that there is no scale to say with assurance in a particular case that the federal interest asserted is more or less important than the interest in preserving uniformity of result with the state court.\" C. Wright & M. Kane, The Law of Federal Courts.\n\n\"The [Byrd] opinion exhibits a confusion that exceeds even that normally surrounding a balancing test, and lower courts understandably experienced considerable difficulty in applying it.\" J. Ely, The Irrepressible Myth of Erie, 87 Harv. L. Rev. 693\n\n\n"}
{"id": "32160021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32160021", "title": "Center for Women's Justice", "text": "Center for Women's Justice\n\nThe Center for Women's Justice (, \"Merkaz Tzedek LeNashim\") is a public interest law firm devoted to advancing and protecting the rights of women to justice, equality and dignity under Jewish law in Israel. CWJ is a member organization of ICAR, the International Coalition for Agunah Rights.\n\nThe Center for Women's Justice (CWJ) was founded in Jerusalem in 2004, by attorney Susan Weiss. CWJ initiated the practice of suing recalcitrant husbands (men who refuse to divorce their wives under the authority of Jewish law) for financial damages (torts) in Israel's civil courts. CWJ has stated that they intend to file as many claims for \"get\" abuse as possible across the country. Their declared goal is to make it an established legal certainty in Israeli courts that get refusal is no longer understood as a religious right, but rather as a civil wrong requiring the awarding of financial damages. \n\nIn 2007 CWJ sued the Israeli Justice Ministry for NIS 4.5 million on behalf of an Israeli woman who had been denied a divorce from her husband for 18 years. The suit alleged that the Supreme Rabbinical Court was guilty of criminal negligence for having assisted the husband in extorting the wife in exchange for a divorce. In 2010 CWJ was one of a number of organizations who filed suit against Israeli Justice Minister Yaakov Neeman to repeal an Israeli law which prevents women from applying for the position of the executive director of the Rabbinical court. CWJ currently provides professional training for attorneys, legal advocacy and education about harmful rabbinic practices. They are funded by a variety of foundations including the New Israel Fund, the Hadassah Foundation and the National Council of Jewish Women.\n\nCWJ became involved in conversion issues in Israel when they took on a client whose Jewish status had come into question during a standard divorce case. In the process of divorce proceedings the Rabbinic judge began to question the religious observance of the wife, a convert to Judaism. Instead of receiving a divorce, the Rabbinic courts revoked the conversion—an unheard of decision—as according to Jewish tradition a conversion once completed is irrevocable. The original decision not only revoked the woman and her children's Jewish status, but also brought into question all of the conversions done under the authority of Rabbi Haim Drukman, the head of the Conversion Authority within the Israeli Prime Minister's office. CWJ was joined in the suit by several organizations including Na'amat, WIZO and Emunah.\n\nIn May 2009, the Israeli High Court of Justice gave the \"dayanim\" of the Supreme Rabbinical Court 90 days to justify their decision to revoke the conversions done under the auspices of Rabbi Haim Druckman's conversion court. One of the petitioners was represented by CWJ. Shimon Ya'acobi, attorney for the Rabbinic courts argued that the matter rested solely under the jurisdiction of the religious courts and the secular courts had no authority to rule on the matter. Druckman's special conversion court, while dealing exclusively with religious conversion, operated out of the Prime Minister's office and was not under the jurisdiction of the Rabbinical courts.\n\nCWJ's educational efforts include a series of YouTube videos. These videos feature a fictional character known as Savta Bikorta (\"lit.\" Grandmother Criticism) who narrates the stories of some of CWJ's real-life court cases in a highly sarcastic tone. In the summer of 2011, CWJ introduced a blog. Blog posts feature CWJ staff, volunteers and interns grappling with the issues they encounter in their daily work with the organization. CWJ Social Awareness Coordinator Rivkah Lubitch has a regular column on Ynet, a major Israeli news site, in which she discusses issues of religion, state and gender as experienced in her work with CWJ.\n\n"}

Founding members and architects were Jiří Němec, Václav Benda, Ladislav Hejdánek, Václav Havel, Jan Patočka, Zdeněk Mlynář, Jiří Hájek, Martin Palouš, Pavel Kohout and Ladislav Lis. Spreading the text of the document was considered a political crime by the communist regime. After the 1989 Velvet Revolution, many of its members played important roles in Czech and Slovak politics.\n\nMotivated in part by the arrest of members of the psychedelic band Plastic People of the Universe, the text of Charter 77 was prepared in 1976. In December 1976, the first signatures were collected. The charter was published on 6 January 1977, along with the names of the first 242 signatories, which represented various occupations, political viewpoints, and religions. Although Václav Havel, Ludvík Vaculík and Pavel Landovský were detained while trying to bring the charter to the Federal Assembly and the Czechoslovak government, and the original document was confiscated, copies circulated as samizdat and on 7 January were published in several western newspapers (including Le Monde, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, The Times and The New York Times) and transmitted to Czechoslovakia by Czechoslovak-banned radio broadcasters like Radio Free Europe and Voice of America.\n\nCharter 77 criticized the government for failing to implement human rights provisions of a number of documents it had signed, including the 1960 Constitution of Czechoslovakia, the Final Act of the 1975 Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (Basket III of the Helsinki Accords), and 1966 United Nations covenants on political, civil, economic, and cultural rights. The document also described the signatories as a \"loose, informal, and open association of people . . . united by the will to strive individually and collectively for respect for human and civil rights in our country and throughout the world.\" It emphasized that Charter 77 is not an organization, has no statutes or permanent organs, and \"does not form the basis for any oppositional political activity.\" This final stipulation was a careful effort to stay within the bounds of Czechoslovak law, which made organized opposition illegal.\n\nMany of the organization's activists and members gathered on 29 March 2007 at the Orange Tree Theatre in Richmond, London, to observe the movement's 30th anniversary and to discuss the historical impact their movement generated in modern European politics.\n\nThe government's reaction to the appearance of Charter 77 was harsh. The official press described the manifesto as \"an anti-state, anti-socialist, and demagogic, abusive piece of writing,\" and individual signatories were variously described as \"traitors and renegades,\" \"a loyal servant and agent of imperialism,\" \"a bankrupt politician,\" and \"an international adventurer.\" As it was considered to be an illegal document, the full text of Charter 77 was never published in the official press. However an official group of artists and writers was mobilized into an \"anti-charter\" movement which included Czechoslovakia's foremost singer Karel Gott as well as prominent comedic writer Jan Werich who later claimed he had no idea of what he was doing whilst signing the anti-charter. \n\nSeveral means of retaliation were used against the signatories, including dismissal from work, denial of educational opportunities for their children, suspension of drivers' licenses, forced exile, loss of citizenship, and detention, trial, and imprisonment. Many members were forced to collaborate with the communist secret service (the StB, Czech: Státní bezpečnost).\n\nThe treatment of Charter 77 signatories prompted the creation in April 1978 of a support group, the Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Prosecuted (\"Výbor na obranu nespravedlivě stíhaných\" – VONS), to publicize the fate of those associated with the charter. In October 1979 six leaders of this support group, including Václav Havel, were tried for subversion and sentenced to prison terms of up to five years.\n\nRepression of Charter 77 and VONS members continued during the 1980s. Despite unrelenting harassment and arrests, however, the groups continued to issue reports on the government's violations of human rights. Until the Velvet Revolution, Charter 77 had approximately 1,900 signatories.\n\nUnder the dictatorship, the influence of Charter 77 remained limited and only 1,065 people ever signed the document. It didn't reach wide groups of people and most of its members were from Prague. The majority of Czechoslovak citizens knew of the organization only because of the government's campaign against it.\n\nIn the late 1980s, as the Eastern Bloc regimes weakened, members of Charter 77 saw their opportunity and became more involved in organizing opposition against the regime in power. During the days of the Velvet Revolution, members of the group negotiated the smooth transfer of political power from dictatorship to democracy. Many were elevated into high positions in the government (e.g. Václav Havel became the President of Czechoslovakia) but since most had no experience in active politics (such as skills in diplomacy or knowledge of capitalism) they met with mixed success. \n\nCharter 77 included people who had a wide range of opinions and, after reaching their common goal, the group's presence faded. An attempt to make the group the focal point of an all-encompassing political party (the Civic Forum) failed and in 1992 the organization was officially dissolved.\n\nIn 1984 Charter 77 was awarded the first Andrei Sakharov Freedom Award.\n\n\nText of the Charter\n\nFurther reading\n"}

Created by the Polish communists in the Polish People's Republic, it was based on the 1936 Soviet Constitution (also known as Stalin Constitution), and it superseded the post-war provisional Small Constitution of 1947 which, in its turn, had declared null and void the pre-war April Constitution of Poland passed by the Polish Sejm in 1935. The Russian text of the Constitution was reviewed and 'corrected' by Joseph Stalin himself, and later translated into Polish. It legalized the communist legislature and practices as they had been introduced to Poland with the Polish Committee of National Liberation in the wake of Red Army progress in 1944.\n\nThe constitution of 1952 broke the tradition of separation of powers, and introduced instead the Soviet concept of \"unity of the state's power\". While the ultimate power was reserved for the dictatorship of the proletariat, expressed as \"the working people of the towns and villages\", the Sejm, the legislative branch of the government, had the paramount authority in government as per the 'will of the people', and oversaw both the judicial and executive branches of the government. But as Warsaw law professor Rozmaryn expressed it, there is a big difference between the \"law in books\" and the \"law in action, explaining that from 1952 through at least 1956 the Sejm exercised no real power, while the State Council (the executive committee of the Sejm) exercised it all instead.\nThe constitution was amended twenty-four times, with the most contentious amendment being that of 10 February 1976. Following the revolutions of 1989 it was significantly amended between 1989 and 1992, and after 29 December 1989 it was known simply as the Constitution of the Republic of Poland. It was superseded by the new Polish constitution on 2 April 1997.\n\nIn the Polish people's referendum, 1946 the Senate of Poland had been abolished with the Sejm remaining the sole legislative body in Poland. Under the 1952 constitution the Sejm officially became the \"supreme organ of state power\" under article 20.\n\nThe Sejm of the People's Republic of Poland started with 425 members in 1952, set so that one deputy represented 60,000 citizens. However, as the population grew the number of deputies expanded, so that by 1960 the constitution was amended, dropping the calculation and stabilizing the Sejm at 460 deputies. An article in the constitution stated that deputies were responsible to the people and could be recalled by the people, although this article was never used. Instead of the five-point electoral law, a four-point version was used (not proportional).\n\nLegislation was passed by majority vote. The Sejm voted on the budget and national plans as proposed by the executive. The Sejm deliberated in sessions, but the sessions were called by the State Council.\n\nThe Sejm would also choose a 'Prezydium' body from its members, with the marshal of the Sejm always being a member of the United People's Party. During its first session the Sejm would also nominate the Prime Minister together with other ministers (Council of Ministers) and members of the State Council. The Sejm would also choose many other government officials, including the head of the Supreme Chamber of Control (\"Najwyższa Izba Kotroli, NIK\"), members of the State Tribunal (\"Trybunał Stanu\") and Constitutional Tribunal (\"Trybunał Konstytucjny\") as well as the Ombudsman (\"Rzecznik Praw Obywatelskich\") (the latter three institutions were created in the 1980s).\n\nIn practice, like its counterparts in other Communist regimes, the Sejm did little more than rubber-stamp decisions already made by the PZPR.\n\nExecutive power was held by the Council of Ministers and State Council. The State Council replaced the previous Polish head of the state, the president of Poland (the last one being Bolesław Bierut).\n\nArticle 29 provided that State Council members were elected at the first session of the Sejm for the term of the Sejm (established at four years by Article 28), and could be composed of both deputies and non-deputies; they were usually chosen from the dominant party (that party being the Polish United Workers' Party) although occasionally it contained non-party members. The council acted as the Head of State (in practice usually through the Chairmen of the Council of State). Article 30 of the constitution set out the authority of the State Council, including representing the Polish People's Republic in foreign relations and the ratification of international treaties. The Council also had the vote in matters related to the military. It granted citizenship and could invoke pardon. The council not only had legislative initiative under Article 25, but could issue administrative decrees under Article 31. However, those decrees had to be confirmed by the Sejm in its next session. The council also defined the interpretation of laws, which in many countries is reserved to the judiciary.\n\nThe deputies of the Council of Ministers also had legislative initiative under Article 25. The composition of the Council of Ministers was set forth at Article 39. The Council of Ministers developed the state budget and the socio-economic plans and presented them to the Sejm for approval. After approval the Council of Ministers oversaw the execution of the plans and the budget.\n\nThe Supreme Court was the overseer of all other courts, which were divided into regional, voivodeship and particular (administrative and military). In 1980, the Supreme Administrative Court was introduced, and in 1982, the State Tribunal (which also existed in the Second Polish Republic), Constitutional Tribunal and the Ombudsman were introduced.\n\nDuring its forty-five years of service, the Constitution of the Polish People's Republic was subject to many changes, with its text amended 24 times.\n\nThe most known amendment was that of 10 February 1976. First suggested by the government in 1975, the amendment declared that Poland was a socialist country, the PZPR was the leading force in the building of socialism and Poland shared \"unshakable fraternal bonds\" with the Soviet Union. This amendment caused the protest resulting in the Letter of 59 asking for inclusion of human rights as stated in the Helsinki Accords. The government backed off somewhat, and the final amendment deleted the phrase \"citizens' right depend upon fulfillment of civic duties\", changed \"unshakable fraternal bonds\" to \"strengthen friendship\" and made other conciliatory changes, but after the revised amendment passed there were still protests from the Catholic church and intellectuals.\n\nThe constitution was heavily amended in the years after the Revolutions of 1989. The amendments purged the document of its Communist character. Among the more important changes: \n\nAs in most other communist countries, the constitution was based on the 1936 Soviet Constitution and thus failed to regulate the main source of power - the communist party, which was the Polish United Workers' Party in the case of Poland. See also the statute of the Polish United Workers' Party. The constitution also served as a propaganda tool proclaiming the \"People's Republic of Poland\", and in theory establishing human rights.\n\n\n"}

It is a judicial body which is separate and independent from the executive, the legislative and the judiciary. It is responsible for supervising the constitutionality of laws and other legislative instruments. The law of constitutional court of Armenia is defined both in Armenian constitution and in law. \n\nIt was established in 1995. The president of the Constitutional Court is Hrayr Tovmasyan.\n\nIn December 1988, a Constitutional Control Committee was set up under an amendment to the Constitution of the Soviet Union. The Law of the Union relating to this Committee also provided for creating a Constitutional Control Committee in each Republic of the Union, which never actually happened. \n\nIn 1991, the Armenian legislature considered setting up a Constitutional Court, although it never actually did so (two laws, namely the Law on the President of the Republic of 1 October 1991 and the Law on the Supreme Council of the Republic of Armenia of 19 November 1991, simply alluded to such a Constitutional Court). However, no law or amendment to the Constitution of the Armenian SSR was ever adopted to put this declaration of intention into effect.\n\nThe new Constitution promulgated by referendum on 5 July 1995 finally set up the Armenian Constitutional Court. The Law on the Constitutional Court was adopted by the Armenian National Assembly on 20 November 1995 and signed by the President of the Republic Levon Ter-Petrosyan on 6 December 1995. On 5 and 6 February 1996 the members of the Constitutional Court were appointed and the Court began operating on 6 February 1996, when its members were sworn in before the National Assembly. \n\nIn 2005 Constitutional reforms took place in Armenia. On November 27, 2005, the text of the RA Constitution (with the Amendments) was adopted by referendum. The amendments addressed the system of constitutional justice. Article 93 of the Constitution enshrined: “The Constitutional Court shall administer the constitutional justice in the Republic of Armenia.” According to Article 94 of the Constitution “The powers, the procedures of formation and activities of the courts shall be defined by the Constitution and laws.\" As a result of the Constitutional Amendments the scope of the persons applying to the Constitutional Court, as well as the scope of the objects of the constitutional control, was substantially extended, the Institute of the Individual Constitutional Complaint was established in the Republic of Armenia (Article 100 Point 6 of the RA Constitution).\n\nThe Constitutional Court comprises nine members. Membership of the Constitutional Court is open to any citizen of the Republic aged 35 or over. The members (including the President) discharge their duties until the age of 65 (according to transitional provisions, namely Article 117, Paragraph 13 of the RA Constitution, the incumbent members of the Constitutional Court shall continue to remain in office until the age of 70 years). The National Assembly and the President of the Republic are jointly empowered to appoint members of the Constitutional Court. Five members of the Constitutional Court are elected by the National Assembly upon the recommendation of the Chairman of the National Assembly. The other four members are appointed by the President of the Republic, at his/her discretion. The President of the Constitutional Court is not elected by the members of the Constitutional Court. He/she is appointed from the Court membership by the National Assembly on a nomination from the Chairman of the Assembly. \nHowever, if the National Assembly fails to appoint the President of the Constitutional Court within 30 days after the office of the President of the Constitutional Court is vacant the President of the Republic must do so in its place. \nPersons fulfilling the following conditions are eligible for membership of the Constitutional Court: \n• citizens of the Republic aged at least 35 who holds electoral rights and does not have citizenship of any other country; \n• higher legal education qualifications or an academic degree in Constitutional Law at least 10 years of legal work experience; \n• command of the Armenian language. \nMembers of the Constitutional Court may not be engaged in any entrepreneurial activity nor shall he/she hold any office in state or local self-government bodies not related to his/her duties, hold any position in commercial organizations, as well as engage in any other paid occupation, except for scientific, educational and creative work, which shall not hinder from fulfilling the duties of the Member of the Constitutional Court. \nThe constitutional principle is that a member of the Court Constitutional Court cannot be dismissed. Decisions to dismiss a Court members must be taken by the person or body (i.e. the President of the Republic or the National Assembly; in the latter case, by a majority vote of the total number of Deputies) having appointed the member in question. Where such a question has been raised, the Constitutional Court must consider the case in the member’s absence, and must issue a conclusion- on the termination of the member’s office by a majority of at least two thirds of the Court membership (i.e. 6 out of 9). Once the conclusion has been issued, the actual decision on the Constitutional Court member’s dismissal must be taken by the authority having appointed him or her (although in fact no member of the Constitutional Court has ever been dismissed since its inauguration). The independence of the members of the Constitutional Court is guaranteed by their submission to the Constitution and the Law on the Constitutional Court. It is prohibited to influence a member of the Constitutional Court, and anyone attempting to do so is liable to prosecution.\n\nA court member ceases to discharge his/her functions when she/he: \n1) Has reached the age of 65\n2) Has died\n3) Has had his/her citizenship withdrawn or has been granted a foreign citizenship\n4) Has applied in writing to the body that has appointed him/her, requesting to terminate his powers and has informed the Constitutional Court of that appeal and at least in 10 days has reiterated his/her resignation. \n5) Is determined by a Court of Law to be unable to work, missing or dead\n6) Has been found guilty by a Court of Law\n7) Has been appointed with a violation of Constitution, which was proved by a Court of Law.\n\nOn a conclusion from the Constitutional Court, members of the Court must be dismissed if they:\n1) Have been absent for three times within one year from the sessions of the Court without an excuse\n2) Have been unable to fulfill his/her powers as the Constitutional Court for six months member because of some temporary disability or other lawful reason\n3) Violate the rules of incompatibility related to the Constitutional Court Member that are prescribed by this Law. \n4) Express an opinion in advance on the case being reviewed by the Constitutional Law or otherwise raised suspicion in his/her impartiality or released information on the process of the closed door consultation or broke the oath of the Constitutional Court Member in any other way. \n5) Are affected by a physical disease or illness, which affected the fulfilment of the duties of a Constitutional Court Member.\n\nThe Constitutional Court shall, in conformity with the procedure defined by law: \n\nSince the first year of its formation the RA Constitutional Court has become a member of the European Commission \"For Democracy through Law\" of the Council of Europe (Venice Commission). One year later, in October 1997, the International Organization \"Conference of the organs of constitutional control of the countries of young democracy\" has been established, the activity of which is coordinated by the RA Constitutional Court. And in 2000, when Armenia was not a member of the Council of Europe yet, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Armenia was elected as a full member of an international organization \"Conference of European Constitutional Courts\". Yves Guena, President of the Constitutional Council of France, estimated this unprecedented fact very specifically: \"The RA Constitutional Court is already a successful institution and it has become the full member of the Conference due to its active participation and numerous interesting and real proposals\".\n\nThe organization of the Annual Yerevan International Conference, in cooperation with the European Commission \"For Democracy through Law\" of the Council of Europe (Venice Commission), has become a new tradition. Each conference was differing from the previous one by its actual topic and the large number of participants. And so, a large number of well-known and authoritative lawyers and constitutionalists participated in 15th Yerevan International Conference. \nAll presented reports, discussions and analyses of the topics of the Conference have been published in the four-language International Almanac \"Constitutional Justice in the new millennium\" and are placed on the RA Constitutional Court web-site, which, by the way, is recognized as one of the best in the world. \nA special compact disk has been prepared by the Constitutional Court, where the Constitutions of 150 countries and their comparative analysis are included. The International Association of Constitutional Law recognized it as an important program and placed it on the web-site of the International Association. This unique program package translated into Russian and English is a concise material for constitutionalists and constitutional courts.\n\nThe RA Constitutional Court has elaborated a complex program of comparative analysis of the international official documents, where 1500 documents adopted by the United Nations and all international European institutions are included (in Russian and English). The studying, analyzing and decision forwarding processes of the experience of the European Court and the materials of the European Convention on Human Rights have already finished.\n\n\nOn 1 November 2013, the President of the Constitutional Court of Armenia, Mr Gagik Harutyunyan, in his quality of coordinator of the Professional Commission for Constitutional Reforms (hereinafter “the Commission”), and on behalf of the President of the Republic of Armenia, requested the assistance of the Venice Commission in the process of revision of the Constitution of Armenia.\nA Specialized Commission on Constitutional Reforms was formed by the Decree of the President of the Republic of Armenia as of 4 September 2013 based on the necessity for implementing the principle of the rule of law, guaranteeing the basic human rights and freedoms, for ensuring the complete balancing of powers and increasing the efficiency of public administration. Having analyzed the historic process of constitutional developments in the Republic of Armenia within the framework of systemic integrity, as well as its key peculiarities and the existing problems, the Specialized Commission on Constitutional Reforms considers it necessary to highlight the following main stages in terms of conceptual approaches.\nIn view of the international constitutional developments and the Armenian constitutional culture, we have still not found safeguards for ensuring stable development of constitutional legal relations. As a constant and continuous process, constitutional developments have taken place in the international practice in line with the developments of society in the following main ways:\n\nAccording to a 2008 source, the 2004 Law Republic of the Republic of Armenia requires bar admission in order for attorneys to practice law. Prior to 2004, there was no requirement for a unified nationwide bar. In 1998, following the passage of the first law on advocacy, the following bar associations were created: Union of Advocates of the Republic of Armenia (the latest incarnation of the Collegium of Advocates), International Bar Union, and the International Union of Armenian Advocates. The International Bar Union and the International Union of Armenian Advocates would merge into a single organization.\n\nThe library of the Constitutional Court was formed in 1996. The library is rich with juridical, scientific, and media materials, and is envisaged not only for the members and staff of the Constitutional Court but also for the students and all those who are interested in jurisprudence. \nIn the library there are dictionaries, textbooks, collection of laws, books on the elections of state books on the elections of state and local power organs, on criminal, criminal procedural, civil, civil procedural, administrative law of the Republic of Armenia, Russian Federation, publications on human rights protection, history and theory of state and law of Armenia and foreign countries. Besides the juridical literature, in the Library of the Constitutional Court there are also books concerning politics, economics, culture, philosophy, sociology, as well as fiction. \nIn the library the constitutions, laws on constitutional courts, and materials on judiciary and constitutional justice system of more than 60 countries exist. The library is periodically filled with new books and periodical press from Russian Federation and other countries. The remarkable literary fund of library makes the literature dedicated to the history of the Armenian Church and to the Genocide, as well as Parliament protocols of 1918–1920. The library has more than 5000 books in Armenian, Russian, English, French and other languages. In the library the alphabetical and systematic databases, subject card files are formed, the bibliographic work is done. \nThe Centre of Constitutional Law has partially taken the work on preparation of text-books on legal topics, special methodical handbooks have been prepared for teachers, simultaneously, a handbook \"Constitutional Review\" of G. Harutyunyan has been published for students. Annually organizing the traditional Republican Students and pupils Olympiad \"Constitution and Law\" is the one of effective methods for a new generation to get acquainted with the principles of constitutional justice. 3 collections of the best pupils works dedicated to the human rights protection have been published. The Council of Young Researchers has been established in the RA Centre of Constitutional Law and library with the rich and newer literature has been established in the RA Constitutional Court. Close relationships have been formed with the numerous schools, thematic meetings have been organized. \n55 monographs and 191 scientific articles have been published by the Constitutional Court members and the staff members, 48 reports have been made during International Conferences, and 17 International Conferences have been invited (with participation of around 155 members of constitutional courts of different countries and 52 international experts). \n72 volumes of the gazette \"Constitutional Court\", 63 editions and 8 appendixes of the International Bulletin \"Constitutional justice\", 12 editions of the International Almanac \"Constitutional justice in a new millennium\" (published in four languages) have been published and forwarded to more than 50 countries.\n\n\n \n"}

In 1952, the year before the Convention was adopted, women's suffrage had been granted in less than 100 countries worldwide.\n\nThe main impetus for the legislation, and much of its drafting, came from the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women. The Commission sent a survey about women's political rights to its member states; the resulting replies became the basis for the Convention.\n\nThe Convention was adopted on 31 March 1953.\n\nThe preamble of the Convention reiterates the principles set out in article 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which declares that all people have the right to participate in the government of their country, and to access public services. The \"Convention on the Political Rights of Women\" specifically protects this right for women.\n\nThe first three articles of the Convention assert the rights of women to vote (Article I), to be eligible for election (II), and to hold public office (III), with each article ending with the specification: \"all on equal terms with men, without any discrimination.\" The remaining articles cover the mechanics of the legislation itself, specifying how and when it will come into force (Articles IV–XI).\n\nThe Convention entered into force on 7 July 1954. As of August 2015, it has 123 state parties, comprising 122 United Nations member states plus the State of Palestine.\n\nThe Convention was the first international legislation protecting the equal status of women to exercise political rights. Moreover, it was the first international treaty to obligate its states to protect citizens' political rights. The Convention was one of the United Nations' several efforts in the postwar period to set standards of nondiscrimination against women; others were the Convention on the Nationality of Married Women and the Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage and Registration of Marriages, brought into force in 1958 and 1964, respectively.\n\nThe rights outlined by the Convention were incorporated into the later, more substantial Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. This later Convention, a wider-reaching and more straightforward legislation for nondiscrimination, was approved by unanimous vote in 1967.\n\n\n"}

The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution adopting the convention on 9 December 1994.\n\nParties to the convention agree to criminalise the commission of murders or kidnappings of UN or association personnel as well as violent attacks against the equipment, official premises, private accommodation, or means of transport of such persons. Parties to the convention also agree to criminalise the attempted commission or threatened commission of such acts. \"UN personnel\" refers to individuals engaged or deployed by the UN Secretary-General as members of the military, police, or civilian components of a UN operation; it also includes officials of the UN specialized agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency. \"Associated personnel\" includes other personnel—such as members of non-governmental organizations—assigned to act in an official capacity by UN personnel.\n\nA central provision of the convention is the principle of \"aut dedere aut judicare\"—that a party to the treaty must either (1) prosecute a person who commits an offence against UN or associated personnel or (2) send the person to another state that requests his or her extradition for prosecution of the same crime.\n\nThe convention states that the military and police components of a UN operation—including vehicles, aircraft, and vessels—shall bear distinctive UN identification and that all UN and associated personnel shall carry appropriate identification. The treaty also states that the UN and associated personnel shall respect and abide by the domestic laws of the host state.\n\nBy the end of 1995, the convention had been signed by 43 states and it came into force on 15 January 1999 after it had been ratified by 22 states. As of June 2016, the treaty has been ratified by 93 states, which includes 92 UN member states plus the State of Palestine. The states that signed the convention but have not yet ratified it are Haiti, Honduras, Malta, Pakistan, Sierra Leone, and the United States.\n\nOn 8 December 2005, the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel was adopted by the UN General Assembly. The Optional Protocol simply expands the scope of what constitutes a \"UN operation\" to include \"delivering humanitarian, political or development assistance in peacebuilding\" and \"delivering emergency humanitarian assistance\". The Optional Protocol was signed by 34 states, came into force on 19 August 2010, and as of June 2016 has been ratified by 30 states.\n\n\n\n"}

The decrees are numbered with letters of the Latin alphabet, starting with \"Coptos Decree a\" and ending with \"Coptos Decree r\". The earliest of the series were issued by Pepi I and Pepi II Neferkare to favor the clergy of the temple of Min, while the others are datable to the reign of various kings of the Eighth Dynasty, and concern various favors granted to an important official from Coptos named Shemay and to his family members. The decrees reflect the waning of the power of the pharaoh in the early First Intermediate Period.\n\nThe Coptos decrees should not be confused with the \"Coptos Decree of Nubkheperre Intef\", a unique document datable to the much later 17th Dynasty.\n\nTen of the decrees were discovered during the 1910–1911 excavations of the temple of Min at Coptos by Adolphe Reinach and Raymond Weill, working for the Société française des fouilles archéologiques. The decrees had been carefully stowed under the ruins of a Roman mudbrick structure. The remaining decrees originate either from the same excavations or from illegal operations by local people that were sold in Luxor in 1914 to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nThe decrees are inscribed on limestone slabs thick, long and high which were intended to be set in the mudbrick wall of a gateway or vestibule inside the temple of Min. As time passed, the space available on the temple walls diminished and the Coptos decrees were dismounted and put away to make space for newer decrees which explains their find spot.\n\nThe decrees are symptomatic of the powers held by the nomarchs at the very end of the Old Kingdom and beginning of the First Intermediate Period. Decrees \"g\" to \"r\" are addressed to Shemay, his son Idy and one of Idy's brothers. Shemay, already the nomarch of Coptos, is promoted first to governor of Upper Egypt and then to vizier of Upper Egypt, while his son Idy takes his place after him.\n\nAlan H. Gardiner and William C. Hayes find decree \"r\" particularly remarkable because, while it is emitted by the pharaoh, the decree is solely concerned with the welfare and properties of the vizier Idy. For Hayes this reflects the fact that at the end of the 8th Dynasty, royal power had diminished so much that it owed its survival to puissant nomarchs, upon whom it could only bestow titles and honours. The nomarch of Coptos would have been particularly cherished by the Memphite rulers who were threatened by the nomarchs of Middle Egypt, especially those of Herakleopolis, who would soon overthrow them and found the 9th Dynasty.\n\nThe discovery of the decrees was initially considered by Kurt Sethe to support the hypothesis of the existence of a \"Dynasty of Coptos\", a local lineage of more or less independent rulers during the First Intermediate Period, to be identified with the issuers of the decrees subsequent to the 6th Dynasty. This hypothesis is nowadays considered implausible as was shown by Hayes and others, in particular it is highly unlikely that a king reigning from Coptos would appoint a vizier over the same area.\n\nThe following complete list is based on William C. Hayes's 1946 publication \"Royal decrees from the temple of Min at Coptus\":\n\n"}

The broadly-based comparative research resulted in the drafting of “Principles of European Tort Law”, which provide a foundation for discussing a future harmonisation of the law of tort in the European Union. Further, the \"Principles\" shall form a stimulus for both academics and practitioners and could serve as a guideline for national legal systems, thereby leading to gradual legal harmonisation. Finally, the present isolated tort law regulations, which are at times themselves contradictory, require a uniform concept from the European Union.\n\nThe European Group on Tort Law spent more than a decade on preparatory works for the \"Principles\". These studies have been published in the series \"Principles of European Tort Law\". The “Principles of European Tort Law” themselves have also already been released in print, accompanied by a commentary and several translations. The online version of the \"Principles\" in several languages can be found on the Group's website at [www.egtl.org.]\n\nIn addition to the \"Principles\", ECTIL has also undertaken several projects of its own. The topics range from fundamental questions, e.g. non-pecuniary or pure economic loss, to the relationship between tort law and related schemes such as liability insurance or social security, from several studies in the health-care sector to compensation for victims of terrorism.\n\nThe results are published in ECTIL's series \"Tort and Insurance Law\". Most projects are also discussed at international conferences at various European locations.\n\nDue to the international nature of the research undertaken by ECTIL, close bonds have been formed with both academics and practitioners whose contributions are vital to the study of the respective legal system. While ECTIL co-operates with several other European research institutions, its closest partner is the Institute for European Tort Law (ETL), founded in 2002 as a Research Unit of the Austrian Academy of Sciences and converted into an Academy Institute in 2008. Not only do both institutions share offices and library, but they also draw from their mutual network of researchers built up over the years. ECTIL and ETL have thereby established a think tank of more than 160 researchers in over 40 countries, including all jurisdictions of the European Union, as well as Norway, Switzerland, Israel, South Africa, Japan and the United States of America.\n\nThe Annual Conference on European Tort Law (ACET) is held in Vienna every year and provides both practitioners and academics with the opportunity to learn of the most significant recent developments in tort law within Europe in each calendar year preceding the conference.\n\nExperts from all over Europe present the highlights of their contributions to the European Tort Law Yearbook, which is published after each conference. The reporters provide a comprehensive overview of the previous year's court practice and legislation in the respective jurisdictions. Furthermore, an overview of the developments in the field of EU law is provided. A comparative analysis reviews the essential aspects of all reports.

It states that \"the right of expatriation is a natural and inherent right of all people\" and \"that any declaration, instruction, opinion, order, or decision of any officers of this government which restricts, impairs, or questions the right of expatriation, is hereby declared inconsistent with the fundamental principles of this government\". Its intent was to counter other countries' claims that U.S. citizens owed them allegiance; it was an explicit rejection of the feudal common law principle of perpetual allegiance.\n\nThe Expatriation Act of 1868 was codified at 25 Rev. Stat. § 1999, and then by 1940 had been re-enacted at . It is now the last note to .\n\nThe United States had, since its early days, implicitly denied the doctrine of perpetual allegiance through its naturalization laws. President Thomas Jefferson wrote to Treasury Secretary Albert Gallatin that \"I hold the right of expatriation to be inherent in every man by the laws of nature … the individual may [exercise such right] by any effectual and unequivocal act or declaration\". Other countries, however, did not recognise this position; indeed, the British Royal Navy's impressment of American sailors was one of the \"casus belli\" provoking the U.S. to join the War of 1812. Those countries' non-recognition of renunciation of their citizenship continued to cause problems for naturalized Americans during the course of the century. In the 1860s, France as well as various German and Scandinavian states attempted to conscript their natives who had become U.S. citizens when they went back to their homelands for short visits. France, Italy, and Switzerland however at least had procedures for abjuring one's original allegiance; Greece, Russia, and the Ottoman Empire did not have such procedures at all, and even sometimes punished their natives for acquiring U.S. citizenship.\n\nIn response to this, President Andrew Johnson called on Congress in his Second Annual Message in December 1866 to assert \"the principle so long maintained by the executive department that naturalization by one state fully exempts the native-born subject of any other state from the performance of military service under any foreign government\". The problem was illustrated more acutely the following year when Britain charged naturalized Americans John Warren and Augustine Costello of the Fenian Brotherhood under the Treason Felony Act 1848. Johnson used this example to illustrate the urgency of the problem in his Third Annual Message in December 1867, stating that it \"perplexes the public mind concerning the rights of naturalized citizens and impairs the national authority abroad\".\n\nIn January 1868, the month after Johnson's Third Annual Message, the House Committee on Foreign Affairs issued a report on nationality issues; their report argued against the doctrine of perpetual allegiance, stating that countries which permitted emigration implicitly recognized the right to renounce one's citizenship as well. Nathaniel P. Banks, head of the Committee, introduced the bill that would become the Expatriation Act on that same day. One of the bill's major proponents was Frederick E. Woodbridge of Vermont. The initial version of the bill had harsh provisions for retaliation against the countries which refused to recognize the right to renounce one's citizenship; for example, if an American was arrested by his native country, the bill would have given the President the power to order the arrest of any of the subjects of that country living in the United States. An amendment added the preamble; the bill as amended was adopted in the House by a vote of 104 to 4. The bill then came before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations; the major amendment in the Senate was to ensure that the retaliatory measures taken by the President would be limited to those \"not amounting to acts of war\". The Senate passed the amended bill 39-7; the amended bill was concurred in by the House.\n\nThe Expatriation Act came into law one day before the Fourteenth Amendment, which introduced the principle of birthright citizenship into the Constitution. The attitude towards emigration and loss of citizenship expressed in the Expatriation Act of 1868 was echoed by the contemporaneous Burlingame Treaty between the United States and China's Qing Dynasty, which stated that both signatory parties recognized \"the inherent and inalienable right of man to change his home and allegiance, and also the mutual advantage of ... free migration and emigration ... for purposes of curiosity, of trade, or as permanent residents\". Other migrant-sending countries also moved towards the principle of recognition of renunciation of citizenship as well, for example through the Bancroft Treaties. By the late nineteenth century, the doctrine of perpetual allegiance had died a \"surprisingly speedy and unlamented death\".\n\nThe Expatriation Act of 1868 did not explicitly create any procedure by which a U.S. citizen might exercise his or her right to give up citizenship. Existing law — namely, the Enrollment Act of 1865 § 21 — provided only two grounds for loss of citizenship, those being draft evasion and desertion. The Bancroft Treaties also had provisions that naturalized U.S. citizens would be deemed to have renounced their U.S. citizenship and resumed their original citizenship if they returned to their native countries and remained there for a certain period of time. Finally, in 1873, Attorney-General George Henry Williams wrote that \"the affirmation by Congress, that the right of expatriation is 'a natural and inherent right in all people' includes citizens of the United States as well as others, and the executive should give to it that comprehensive effect.\" However, William's statement was mostly used to justify the denaturalization of naturalized U.S. citizens. In general, a naturalized American who took up a position in the government or military of his native country was considered to have given up his U.S. citizenship and resumed his original one; however, naturalized Americans who did these same acts in other countries which were not their native countries were seen as having given up their right to U.S. protection, but not to U.S. citizenship itself. In particular, the State Department did not consider that mere establishment of non-U.S. domicile was sufficient grounds for revoking U.S. citizenship. \n\nThere would be no legislation regarding grounds for loss of U.S. citizenship by native-born citizens until the Expatriation Act of 1907 (). Before then, the State Department and the courts seemed to agree that the only act which would cause a native-born citizen to lose U.S. citizenship was voluntary acquisition of citizen or subject status in a foreign state. Even foreign military service was not necessarily held to result in loss of U.S. citizenship; the precedent pointed out by Thomas F. Bayard, Secretary of State during the late 1880s, was that the U.S. did not consider the French who joined the American Revolution to have thus acquired U.S. citizenship. Similarly, voting in a foreign election was not held as definitive evidence of intent to give up citizenship, in the absence of an express acquisition of foreign citizenship and renunciation of the U.S. one. However, the Expatriation Act of 1907 and subsequent legislation would thenceforth broaden the number of actions which, if undertaken voluntarily, would be considered by the U.S. government to prove the intent to lose U.S. citizenship.\n\nIn the 1950 case \"Savorgnan v. United States\", the Supreme Court held that a woman who applied for Italian citizenship by virtue of her marriage to her husband had voluntarily given up her U.S. citizenship. Associate Justice Harold Hitz Burton wrote that:\n\nAnd, in his footnote:\n\nIn the 1957 case \"Briehl v. Dulles\", the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit held that the Department of State could lawfully deny issuance of a United States passport to an applicant who refused to execute an affidavit regarding his political affiliations. However, in a dissenting opinion, Judge David L. Bazelon argued that \"[s]ince expatriation is today impossible without leaving the country, the policy expressed by Congress in 1868 and never repealed precludes a reading of the passport and travel control statutes which would permit the Secretary of State to prevent citizens from leaving\". Chief Judge Henry White Edgerton concurred with Bazelon's opinion.\n\nCongress's power to legislate for implicit expatriation of Americans was later heavily restricted by the 1967 case \"Afroyim v. Rusk\", which concluded that natural-born Americans cannot be deprived of citizenship by any means except a voluntary renunciation in the presence of a consular official. Associate Justice Hugo Black's majority opinion extensively discussed the Expatriation Act of 1868, including the history of proposed amendments to it.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "383021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=383021", "title": "Frank Hague", "text": "Frank Hague\n\nFrank Hague (January 17, 1876 – January 1, 1956) was an American Democratic Party politician who served as the Mayor of Jersey City, New Jersey from 1917 to 1947, Democratic National Committeeman from New Jersey from 1922 until 1949, and Vice-Chairman of the Democratic National Committee from 1924 until 1949.\n\nHague has a widely known reputation for corruption and bossism and has been called \"the grandaddy of Jersey bosses.\" By the time he left office in 1947, he enjoyed palatial homes, European vacations, and a private suite at the Plaza Hotel. His wealth has been estimated to have been over $10 million at the time of his death, although his City salary never exceeded $8,500 per year and he had no other legitimate source of income. His desk, according to legend, had a specially designed lap drawer which could be pushed outward towards the person with whom he was meeting. This allowed his \"guests\" to discreetly deliver bribes in the form of envelopes containing large amounts of cash. However, according to New Jersey preservationist John Hallanan, the drawers were a traditional feature of 19th century partners desks and that \"[t]he last thing [Hague] would need to do is take a bribe personally.\" As of September 2013, the desk was in storage awaiting restoration.\n\nDuring the height of his power Hague's political machine, known as \"the organization,\" was one of the most powerful in the United States controlling politics on local, county, and state levels. Hague's personal influence extended to the national level, influencing federal patronage and presidential campaigns.\n\nFrancis \"Frank\" Hague, born in Jersey City, was the fourth of eight children to John D. and Margaret Hague (née Fagen), immigrants from County Cavan, Ireland. He was raised in Jersey City's Second ward, an area known as The Horseshoe due to its shape which wrapped around a railroad loop. The ward was created when the Republican-controlled legislature gerrymandered a district within Jersey City in 1871 to concentrate and isolate Democratic, and mostly Catholic, votes.\n\nBy age 14, Hague was expelled from school prior to completing the sixth grade for poor attendance and unacceptable behavior. He worked briefly as a blacksmith's apprentice for the Erie Railroad. While training at a local gym for his own potential debut as a prizefighter, he arranged to become manager for Joe Craig, a professional lightweight boxer. Craig was successful enough to allow Hague to buy a few suits that made him appear successful. In 1896, Hague's apparent prosperity gained him the attention of local tavern owner \"Nat\" Kenny who was seeking a candidate for constable in the upcoming primary to run against the candidate of a rival tavern owner. Kenny provided Hague with $75 to \"spread around\", and Frank Hague quickly won his first election by a ratio of three-to-one.\n\nHague's victory in the Constable election brought him to the attention of Hudson County Democratic political boss \"Little Bob\" Davis, and Davis asked Hague to help get out Democratic votes for the upcoming 1897 Mayoral election. Hague's efforts were credited with generating large voter turnout in the Second Ward for the 1897 and 1899 elections. As a reward for his work, Hague was appointed as a Deputy Sheriff at a salary of $25 per week. Over this time, Hague took a leadership role in the Second Ward Democratic club.\n\nIn the 1901 Mayoral election, Republican Mark M. Fagan was elected. Hague's second ward was one of only two that voted Democratic. Hague survived a Republican challenge for a third term as Constable the following year.\n\nAs a ward leader, Hague was approached by a woman to provide assistance for her son, who had been arrested for passing a forged check. The son, Red Dugan, had been a classmate of Hague's in school. According to the \"Boston Evening Transcript\" of October 4, 1904, Dugan had deposited a forged check for $955 in the Peoples Bank of Roxbury, Massachusetts, and convinced the bank manager to let him withdraw $500. Hague ignored a subpoena to testify in Hudson County Court and traveled to Massachusetts to provide an alibi for Dugan. Hague and another deputy sheriff, Thomas \"Skidder\" Madigan, claimed that they had seen Dugan in Jersey City on the day of the alleged offense. Both were threatened with perjury charges.\n\nUpon returning to Jersey City, Hague was found guilty of contempt of court for ignoring the subpoena. He was fined $100 and stripped of his duties as Deputy Sheriff.\n\nIn spite of the resulting press coverage of the event, Hague was more deeply embraced by his constituency. Thomas Smith wrote: \"But to the residents of the Horseshoe, Frank Hague had gone out of his way to help a friend - had practically given his livelihood to aid a brother.\" In the succeeding municipal election of 1905, which saw the return of incumbent Fagan to the office of mayor, Hague was elected to a fourth term as constable.\n\nHague rose through the Democratic machinery of Hudson County, which drew much of its strength by providing newly arrived immigrants with the rudimentary social services. Hague took a job as a collector for a local brewery, leaving him with time to spend in the streets and the local taverns which were hubs of political activity. He also spent his time cleaning up the loose ends of the Second Ward's south-end Democratic Club to consolidate his power.\n\nAs a reward for his efforts in turning out votes in the 1905 election, Bob Davis named Hague as the party leader for the Second Ward and arranged for Hague to be appointed as Sergeant at Arms for the New Jersey State Assembly.\n\nHague broke ties with \"Boss\" Davis in 1906 over a difference of opinion on a candidate for appointment to the city Street and Water Board. As a result, Hague supported H. Otto Wittpenn for mayor in the 1907 election. Wittpenn was a reformer who opposed the control Davis held over Hudson County politics. Over the objections of Davis, newly elected Mayor Wittpenn appointed Hague as chief custodian of City Hall - a \"cushy\" job with plenty of patronage opportunities. During the Wittpenn administration, Hague also became friendly with Wittpenn's secretary - a Presbyterian Sunday school teacher named A. Harry Moore.\n\nThe resulting battle for control of the Hudson County Democratic machine would ironically result in one of the greatest boosts to Hague's rise to power - the Walsh Act of 1911. In 1909 Davis, seeing support for Hague increasing, supported Wittpenn's re-election against former mayor Fagan. Hague's second ward produced the largest plurality of Wittpenn votes of any of Jersey City's 12 wards. Davis then arranged the appointment of Fagan to the Hudson County Tax Board. When Wittpenn's administration began facing troubles, including Fagan's discovery of a Pennsylvania Railroad property that had paid no taxes for four years, Wittpenn blamed Davis.\n\nSeeking to curb the influence of Davis, Wittpenn announced his candidacy for Governor, stating \"I have endured the machine as long as possible, but patience is no longer a virtue.\" Davis, in turn, prevailed upon Woodrow Wilson, then President of Princeton University, to oppose Wittpenn's candidacy. Wilson's victory was overwhelming even in Hague's ward, despite heavy-handed tactics used there. \"The Jersey Journal\" wrote: \"Cops on duty were using clubs and blackjacks to assist Mayor Wittpenn and Frank Hague defeat the Davis men.\"\n\nWilson's reform-minded term as Governor saw the establishment of Presidential primary elections, introduced workers' compensation, and brought about passage of the Walsh Act which provided for a non-partisan commission form of municipal government that was greatly reflective of his academic writings in \"Congressional Government\".\n\n\"Little Bob\" Davis died of cancer shortly after the 1910 gubernatorial election leaving a vacuum in the power structure of the Hudson County Democrats. Wittpenn quickly endorsed the idea of converting Jersey City to a commission form of government, but was opposed by forces, including Hague, attempting to take control of the party. Hague campaigned heavily against the idea in the Horseshoe, claiming that such a system of citywide elected commissioners would erode the influence of the working-class and consolidate power among the city's elite. Wittpenn's opponents successfully petitioned for a change in the date of the vote on the charter change, moving it from September to mid-July, and the proposal was defeated. As a result of this campaign, Hague came under the scrutiny of \"The Jersey Journal\", which had supported the proposed charter change. It was reported that Hague's older brother, a battalion chief on the city fire department, had been on \"sick leave\" for three years at full pay.\n\nHague reconciled with Wittpenn to support his re-election in 1911. Wittpenn then supported Hague's nomination for Commissioner of Streets and Water. Both were elected. The new position greatly expanded Hague's patronage authority. While City Hall employed a few dozen custodians, there were hundreds of workers in the Street and Water Department. Hague's work as head of the Department of Street Cleaners even convinced \"The Jersey Journal\" to endorse him as a \"reform candidate\" in the next election.\n\nIn the spring of 1913, having gained confidence in his own ability to assure himself a place on the commission, Hague supported the renewed effort to change the Jersey City government from the Mayor-Council model to a commission model under the recently adopted Walsh Act. This act would place all executive and legislative powers in a five-man commission, each of whom would head a city department. The five commissioners would choose one of their colleagues to be mayor. The vote for charter change passed, and the stage was set for Frank Hague's rise to power.\n\nIn 1913, the first election for the city commission saw 91 men on the ballot competing for five available seats on the commission. Hague finished fourth with 17,390 votes and was elected to the five-man commission. The only Wittpenn-supported candidate, A. Harry Moore, was also elected. As a result of having garnered the most votes (21,419) former mayor Fagan became the first mayor under this new form of government, and the only Republican to hold that title in Jersey City for the following 75 years. Hague was named public safety commissioner, with control over the police and fire departments. In the same year, Hague cemented his control of the Hudson County political machine by securing for himself the leadership of the Hudson County Democratic Organization Executive Committee.\nHague immediately set about reshaping the corrupt Jersey City police force with tough Horsehoe recruits. Hague spearheaded crackdowns on prostitution and narcotics trafficking, earning him favor with religious leaders. These enforcement acts went as far as Hague himself marching across local Vaudeville stages personally directing the shut down of \"girlie shows.\" At the heart of this change was an inner cadre of officers known as the Zeppelin Squad or \"zepps\" who were personally loyal to Hague alone. The \"zepps\" would spy on, and report back to Hague about other members of the department. Eventually, Jersey City had one patrolman for every 3,000 residents, causing a marked decline in the city's once-astronomical crime rate.\n\nHague took steps to curb the police department's lackadaisical work ethic, punishing offenses that had gone unpunished for years. He also made much-needed improvements to the fire department; at the time he took office Jersey City's fire insurance rates were among the highest in the nation.\n\nUpon discovering in early 1916 that millions of pounds of munitions were being stockpiled on the Jersey City waterfront, Hague travelled to Washington, D.C. to register concerns for the safety of his constituents. His meetings with Congressmen resulted in no action, Congress having decided that Jersey City was an \"appropriate port.\" Hague's concerns were shown to be valid in July 1916 when the Black Tom explosion sent shrapnel flying across the city.\n\nIn 1917, Hague, with his reputation as the man who cleaned up the police force, ran for reelection. He put together a commission ticket called \"The Unbossed.\" The ticket consisted of him, Parks Commissioner Moore, Revenue Commissioner George Brensinger, ex-judge Charles F.X. O’Brien and City Clerk Michael I. Fagan. It swept all five spots on the commission. Moore topped the poll, and traditional practice called for him to be appointed mayor. However, when the commission met for the first time on May 11, Hague was chosen as the new mayor.\n\nTechnically, Hague's only responsibility as mayor was to appoint the school board. Otherwise, he was merely first among equals, with no powers over and above the other four commissioners. However, soon after taking office, he wrested control of the Hudson County Democratic Party from Wittpenn. This allowed him to significantly influence the makeup of the commission in this overwhelmingly Democratic city. He soon built the organization into one of the most powerful political machines in the country. Hague himself became very wealthy, owning a $125,000 summer home in Deal, living in a large apartment in the best building in the city, and able to give a $50,000 altar to a local Catholic church.\n\nHe also had the support of a significant faction of Republicans which dated to his initial election as mayor, when he cut a deal with then-Governor Walter Edge in which Edge effectively ceded North Jersey to Hague in return for keeping South Jersey for himself. Also, as public safety commissioner (a post he held throughout his entire tenure), he controlled the two departments with the most patronage appointments in the city. This post also placed responsibility for maintaining public order in his hands.\n\nHague soon extended his influence statewide by helping to elect his \"puppets\" as governor. In the 1919 gubernatorial election, Hague endorsed State Senator Edward I. Edwards and aggressively campaigned for him. Edwards carried Hudson County by 50,000 votes, which was enough for him to win statewide by just under 15,000 votes. Hague proclaimed himself leader of the New Jersey Democratic Party, and Edwards allowed him to recommend dozens of appointments to high state offices. Democrats won five out of eight gubernatorial races between 1919 and 1940, more often than not due to massive landslides in Hudson County. However, he was never able to extend his dominance to the state legislature.\n\nHague was able to stay in power despite a nearly constant effort to turn him out of office from 1921 onward. He was also able to avoid prosecution despite numerous federal and state investigations in part due to the fact he took most of his kickbacks in cash. However, from the early 1940s onward, many of the older ethnic groups started moving to the suburbs. They were replaced by Poles, Italians, Eastern Europeans and African-Americans. Hague never adapted his methods to the new groups.\n\nHague had little tolerance for those who dared oppose him publicly. He relied on two ordinances of dubious constitutionality to muzzle critics. A 1920 ordinance effectively required people making political speeches to obtain clearance from the chief of police. A 1930 ordinance gave the public safety commissioner—Hague himself—the power to turn down permits for meetings if he felt it necessary to prevent \"riots, disturbances or disorderly assemblage.\" The latter ordinance was struck down as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States, but continued to be enforced for several years after that decision. The police were also allowed to stop and search anyone without probable cause or a warrant after 9 pm.\n\nIn 1932, Hague, a friend of Al Smith, backed Smith against Franklin D. Roosevelt during the race for the Democratic nomination. When Roosevelt won the nomination, Hague offered to organize the biggest political rally anyone had ever seen if Roosevelt would launch his presidential campaign in New Jersey. When Roosevelt formally began his campaign with an event at the Jersey Shore town of Sea Girt, Hague's machine made sure there were several thousand Hudson County voters looking on and cheering. Hague’s support was rewarded with funding for a massive medical center complex complete with a maternity hospital named after his mother, Margaret Hague. During the 1936 campaign Hague provided 150,000 adults and children to cheer Roosevelt during a visit.\n\nHague's use of voter fraud is the stuff of legend. In 1937, for instance, Jersey City had 160,050 registered voters, but only 147,000 people who were at least 21 years old—the legal voting age.\n\nIn 1932, Governor Moore appointed a lawyer named Thomas J. Brogan, who had served as Hague's personal attorney in corruption hearings, to an associate Justice seat on the state's Supreme Court. Less than a year later Brogan was named as Chief Justice. In at least two instances of alleged voting fraud in the 1930s \"(Ferguson v. Brogan, 112 N.J.L. 471; Clee v. Moore, 119 N.J.L. 215; In re Clee, 119 N.J.L. 310)\", Brogan's court issued extraordinary rulings in favor of the Democratic machine, in one case asserting that the district superintendent of elections had no authority to open ballot boxes, and in another case ruling that the boxes could be opened, but no one had the right to look inside. Brogan also assigned himself to the Hudson County jurisdiction, thereby controlling the local grand jury process and squelching other election fraud cases.\n\nAlthough Hague, like other political bosses of the time, was not above outright fraud at the polls, the keys to Hague's success were his matchless organizational skills and demand for complete loyalty from his subordinates. His command over the Democratic voters of Hudson County, a densely populated urban area in a state that was still mostly rural, made him a man to reckon with among state Democrats and Republicans alike. He was a close friend of Al Smith, the New York governor who would become the first Irish-American presidential candidate in 1928. In addition, Hague’s support of Roosevelt for President was rewarded with a steady stream of perks that sustained Hague's organization throughout the Depression.\nThe beginning of the end for Hague came in 1943, when former governor Walter Edge was returned to office. Edge's attorney general, Walter Van Riper, initiated several prosecutions of Hague cronies. Hague retaliated by having his handpicked U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey bring federal indictments against Van Riper, but Van Riper was acquitted. Edge also initiated reforms in the civil service, freeing it from Hague's control.\n\nEdge's successor, fellow Republican Alfred Driscoll, succeeded in further curbing Hague's power over state government. He led the effort to implement a new constitution, which streamlined state government and made it less vulnerable to control by locally based bosses like Hague. For example, county prosecutors were now directly accountable to the state attorney general. It also set up a new state Supreme Court, which was given supervision over the state's judges. As the first Chief Justice, Driscoll appointed an old Hague foe, Arthur T. Vanderbilt. Driscoll also installed voting machines throughout the state, which made it harder for corrupt politicians to steal elections.\n\nSeeing the writing on the wall, Hague abruptly announced his retirement in 1947. However, he was able to have his nephew, Frank Hague Eggers, chosen as his successor. It was generally understood that Hague still held the real power. This ended in 1949 when John V. Kenny, a former Hague ward leader alienated by the appointment of Eggers, put together his own commission ticket. Due to the presence of a \"third ticket,\" Kenny's ticket was able to oust the Hague/Eggers ticket from power, ending Hague's 32-year rule. Kenny soon set up a machine which proved every bit as corrupt as Hague's, but far less efficient at providing services.\n\nHague was accommodating to labor unions during the first half of his mayoral career. For instance, Jersey City police were known for turning back strikebreakers, something unheard of during the 1920s. However, he became a savage opponent of labor organizers in the 1930s. The turnaround came about during a dispute with labor boss and former supporter Theodore \"Teddy\" Brandle, whose attempts to organize the work crews on the Pulaski Skyway construction project (1930–32) touched off a labor war so intense that local newspapers called it \"the war of the meadows.\"\n\nThe rise of the CIO in the mid-1930s represented a threat to Hague's policy of guaranteeing labor peace to the sweatshop type industries that might otherwise have fled Jersey City's high property taxes. When Socialist presidential candidate Norman Thomas came to speak on behalf of the CIO during a May Day rally in Journal Square, Hague's police swept Thomas and his wife into a car, took them to the Pavonia ferry and sent them back to New York. Hague spent much of the decade inveighing against Communists and labor unions, and his attempts to suppress the CIO's activities in Jersey City led to a U.S. Supreme Court decision, Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization 307 U.S. 496 (1939), that is a cornerstone of law concerning public expression of political views on public property.\n\nHague died on New Year's Day in 1956 at his 480 Park Avenue duplex apartment in Manhattan, New York City. While hundreds gathered to see the casket depart the funeral home, only four men were seen to remove their hats for the passing of the coffin. One woman present held an American Flag and a sign that read, \"God have mercy on his sinful, greedy soul.\"\n\nHague was interred in a large mausoleum at Holy Name Cemetery in Jersey City.\n\nHague's pride and joy was the Jersey City Medical Center, which he began creating almost as soon as he became mayor. By the 1940s it had grown into a 10-building complex that provided virtually free medical care to Jersey City residents. At the time of its completion, the Medical Center was one of the biggest medical facilities in the country and included the Medical Center Hospital, Pollak Chest Diseases Hospital, Murdoch Hall, and Margaret Hague Maternity Hospital, named in honor of Hague's mother. The buildings, funded in part through federal funds obtained by Hague, are known for their Art Deco details, including marble walls, terrazzo floors, etched glass, and decorative moldings. Even at the time the Medical Center was too large to operate cost-effectively. In 2005 the 14 acre complex (much of which had fallen into disuse) was sold to a private developer who began converting two towers into a luxury condominium complex called the Beacon.\n\n\"We hear about constitutional rights, free speech and the free press.

The concept of food additives being \"generally recognized as safe\" was first described in the Food Additives Amendment of 1958, and all additives introduced after this time had to be evaluated by new standards.\n\nOn January 1, 1958, the FDA established the Food Additives Amendment of 1958, with a list of 700 food substances that were exempt from the then new requirement that manufacturers test food additives before putting them on the market. On August 31, 1960, William W. Goodrich, assistant general counsel of the FDA, addressed the annual meeting (16 Bus. Law. 107 -1960-1961) of the FFDCA. The purpose of the meeting was the forthcoming March 6, 1961, effective date of the enforcement provisions of the \"Food Additives Amendment of 1958\", referred to as GRAS.\n\nA GRAS determination can be self-affirmed or the FDA can be notified of a determination of GRAS by qualified non-governmental experts:\n\nFor substances used in food prior to January 1, 1958, a grandfather clause allows experience based on common use in food to be used in asserting they are safe under the conditions of their intended use.\n\nThe FDA can also explicitly withdraw the GRAS classification, as it did for trans fat in 2015.\n\nThe Code of Federal Regulations, Revised , includes (CFR) title 21 170.30(b) that provides general recognition of safety through scientific procedures requires the same quantity and quality of scientific evidence as is required to obtain approval of the substance as a food additive and ordinarily is based upon published studies, which may be corroborated by unpublished studies and other data and information.\n\nThe substance must be shown to be \"generally recognized\" as safe under the conditions of its intended use. The proponent of the exemption has the burden of proving that the use of the substance is \"generally recognized\" as safe. To establish such recognition, the proponent must show that there is a consensus of expert opinion regarding the safety of the use of the substance. The existence of a severe conflict among experts regarding the safety of a substance precludes a finding of general recognition.\n\nWhen a use of a substance does not qualify for the GRAS exemption, that use of the substance is subject to the premarket approval mandated by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. In such circumstances, the FDA can take enforcement action to stop distribution of the food substance and foods containing it on the grounds that such foods are or contain an unlawful food additive.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "14364381", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14364381", "title": "Gun legislation in Germany", "text": "Gun legislation in Germany\n\nGun legislation in Germany is regulated by the German Weapons Act () which adheres to the European Firearms Directive, first enacted in 1972, and superseded by the law of 2003, in force . This federal statute regulates the handling of knives, firearms and ammunition as well as acquisition, storage, commerce and maintenance of weapons. It also defines certain forbidden items, including nunchucks, switchblade knives and brass knuckles, and bans their possession and distribution.\n\nIn a recent debate on guns in Germany after a school shooting that killed 15, one weapons expert said that Germany's weapons laws were among the world's strictest, and sufficient for safety. Others argued that more control was needed. While gun ownership is widespread, and associations and ranges for shooting sports and the use of historical guns and weapons in festivals are not forbidden, the use of guns for private self-defence is restricted. The German Ministry of the Interior estimated in 2009 that the number of firearms in circulation, legally and illegally, could be up to 45 million. Germany's National Gun Registry, introduced at the end of 2012, counted 5.5 million firearms in use, which are legally owned by 1.4 million people in the country. About 1.5 Million sport shooters in several thousand Schützenvereinen own and use guns for sport, about 400,000 hunters have a licensed gun, about 300,000 collect guns and about 900,000 own an inherited gun.\n\n\"The Ewige Landfriede\" (Perpetual Public Peace) ruling of 1495 banned the medieval right of vendetta (\"Fehderecht\") in the Holy Roman Empire (which encompassed what is now Germany). It passed at the Diet of Worms and was enacted by the German king and emperor Maximilian I. In the Holy Roman Empire claims were henceforth no longer to be decided in battle, but through legal process. It established a certain monopoly of the state in the use of organized armed force. The German nationalist movement asked for \"Volksbewaffnung,\" a militia system according to the Swiss role model, but failed with those requests in the German revolutions of 1848–49. However, possession of guns and weapons was not generally restricted, but regulations about carrying arms in public came into use.\n\nThe general disarming of citizens and a generic gun law was imposed by the Allies after World War I. The law was introduced by the Weimar Republic; actual enforcement was not stringent, and there was no general disarmament immediately after the war. After incidents including the 1920 Kapp Putsch and the 1922 assassination of Walther Rathenau, the law was enforced more strictly. The Weimar Republic saw various \"Freikorps\" and paramilitary forces like the Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold, the Stahlhelm and the Nazi SA.\n\nThe requirement for \"trustworthiness\" of the owner and \"need\" for the special purpose of the user (e.g. hunting, sport or self-defence) has been included in German gun laws since then.\n\nThe Treaty of Versailles included firearm reducing stipulations. Article 169 targeted the state: \"Within two months from the coming into force of the present Treaty, German arms, munitions, and war material, including anti-aircraft material, existing in Germany in excess of the quantities allowed, must be surrendered to the Governments of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers to be destroyed or rendered useless.\"\n\nIn 1919 the German government passed the \"Regulations on Weapons Ownership\", which declared that \"all firearms, as well as all kinds of firearms ammunition, are to be surrendered immediately.\" Under the regulations, anyone found in possession of a firearm or ammunition was subject to five years' imprisonment and a fine of 100,000 marks.\n\nOn August 7, 1920, rising fears whether or not Germany could have rebellions prompted the government to enact a second gun-regulation law called the \"Law on the Disarmament of the People.\" It put into effect the provisions of the Versailles Treaty in regard to the limit on military-type weapons.\n\nIn 1928 the \"Law on Firearms and Ammunition\" was enacted. It relaxed gun restrictions and put into effect a strict firearm licensing scheme. Under this scheme, Germans could possess firearms, but were required to have separate permits to do the following: own or sell firearms, carry firearms (including handguns), manufacture firearms, and professionally deal in firearms and ammunition. Furthermore, the law restricted ownership of firearms to \"... persons whose trustworthiness is not in question and who can show a need for a (gun) permit.\" \n\nEspecially car associations lobbied for an easy gun permit for car owners which was granted by the government for drivers traveling often in the countryside.\n\nThe 1938 \"German Weapons Act\", the precursor of the current weapons law, superseded the 1928 law. As under the 1928 law, citizens were required to have a permit to carry a firearm and a separate permit to acquire a firearm. \nBut under the new law:\n\nUnder both the 1928 and 1938 acts, gun manufacturers and dealers were required to maintain records about purchasers of guns, with serial numbers. These records were to be delivered to a police authority for inspection at the end of each year.\n\nThe 1938 \"Regulations Against Jews' Possession of Weapons\", which came into force the day after Kristallnacht, effectively deprived all Jews living under the Third Reich within the occupied Sudetenland and Austria of the right to possess any form of weapons, including truncheons, knives, firearms and ammunition. Exceptions were made for Jews and Poles who were foreign nationals under §3 of the act. Before that, some police forces used the pre-existing \"trustworthiness\" clause to disarm Jews on the basis that \"the Jewish population 'cannot be regarded as trustworthy'\".\n\nAfter 1945, even German police officers were initially not allowed to carry firearms. Private ownership of firearms was not allowed until 1956. The legal status returned essentially to that of the \"Law on Firearms and Ammunition\" of 1928. The law was thoroughly revised in 1972, when the new restrictive Federal Weapons Act (\"Bundeswaffengesetz\") became effective, partly as a reaction to the terror of the Red Army Faction. It was developed in the Federal Weapons Act of 2002 and by amendments in 2008 and 2009. These laws were the result of a chain of school shootings in Erfurt, Emsdetten and Winnenden. They led to a public debate, in which blame was attributed to various elements of youth culture and society, including violent computer games, television programs, rock music and private gun ownership.\n\nThe Weapons Act of 2002 increased the age requirements for licensed hunters and competition shooters. It also introduced the requirement of a psychological evaluation for persons under the age of 25 to fulfil the requirement of personal adequacy for large-bore firearms.\n\nThe first amendment became effective on April 1, 2008. The intention of that amendment was to ban certain kinds of weapons like airsoft-guns, tasers, imitation firearms (\"Anscheinswaffen\") and knives with blades longer than 12 cm from public places. They may still be carried in sealed wrappings and for professional or ceremonial purposes. Their use on private premises and in non-public places like gun clubs is not restricted.\n\nThe second amendment became effective on July 17, 2009. It introduced routine verifications of safe firearms storage by local firearms control offices at the homes of licensees. It also tightened the conditions for continuous necessity. A constitutional complaint (\"Verfassungsbeschwerde\") was launched against the law, alleging a violation of the inviolability of the home, guaranteed by Art. 13 of the German constitution.\n\nThe weapons law does not apply to military use of weapons within the Bundeswehr or to the police. The identity cards of German troops and police officers contain a term allowing them to carry weapons. Nonetheless – within the military – issuance of guns and especially ammunition is very strictly controlled.\n\nIn Germany the possession of any firearm with a muzzle energy exceeding 7.5 Joule (~5.5 ft·lb; for comparison, a .22LR cartridge has a muzzle energy of 159 J) requires a valid firearms ownership license for any particular weapon. The current Federal Weapons Act adopts a two-tiered approach to firearms licensing.\n\nThe law on possession of suppressors follows the firearms they are designed for; if a firearm does not require a license, neither does its suppressor.\n\nThe only restriction on magazines for firearms in Germany applies to sports shooters: it is unlawful to \"use\" a magazine that can hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition when sports shooting with long weapons in Germany. The \"acquisition\" and \"possession\" of any magazine of any size for any firearm is legal without a license.\n\nA firearms ownership license (\"Waffenbesitzkarte\" or \"WBK\"), or an entry to an existing WBK, is mandatory for each weapon purchased. It entitles owners to purchase firearms and handle them on their own property and any private property with the property owner's consent. On public premises, a licensed firearm must be transported unloaded and in a stable, fully enclosing, locked container. A weapons ownership license does not entitle the owner to shoot the weapon or carry it on public premises without the prescribed container. Owners must obtain mandatory insurance and a means to securely store the weapon on their premises (a weapons locker). Blanket ownership licenses are issued to arms dealers, firearms experts and – with limitations – to collectors. In 2010 there were about four million legal private gun owners.\n\nA number of criteria must be met before a firearms ownership license is issued:\n\nInheritors of legal firearms can obtain a permit without having to demonstrate expert knowledge or necessity, but without them the firearm has to be blocked by an arms dealer (§ 20 WaffG). An inheritor's license does not include the right to acquire or handle ammunition.\n\nPersons who\nare barred from obtaining a firearms ownership license.\n\nFirearms ownership licenses are issued in three color-coded varieties, depending on the applicants' necessity. While self-defence is usually not accepted as a reasonable grounds for such a license, the following ones are:\n\n\nThe following firearms are banned from sporting use in Germany, and may not be purchased with a license issued for sporting use, but are allowed on hunters' and collectors' licenses:\n\n\nFor persons over 18 years of age, a license is not required to own a single-shot percussion firearm developed before January 1, 1871, or to own and carry any muzzle-loader with a flintlock or earlier design. However, the purchase of black powder or similar in order to actually use the firearms requires a license.\n\nFirearms that are prohibited in Germany may not be owned by anyone except with a special license from the Federal Criminal Police Office, which is only given to manufacturers, exporters, and, on rare occasions, collectors. The most important ones are:\n\n\nFirearms carry permits (\"Waffenschein\") entitle licensees to publicly carry legally owned weapons, whether concealed or not. A mandatory legal and safety class and shooting proficiency tests are required to obtain such a permit. Carry permits are usually only issued to persons with a particular need for carrying a firearm. This includes some private security personnel and persons living under a raised threat level like celebrities and politicians. They are valid up to three years and can be extended. Carrying at public events is prohibited. Licensed hunters do not need a permit to carry loaded weapons while hunting, and unloaded weapons while directly traveling to and from such an activity.\n\nA small firearms carry permit (\"Kleiner Waffenschein\") was introduced in 2002. It can be obtained without having to demonstrate expert knowledge, necessity or a mandatory insurance. The only requirements are that the applicant be of legal age, trustworthy and personally adequate. It entitles the licensee to publicly carry gas pistols (both of the blank and irritant kind) and flare guns. These types of firearms are freely available to adults; only the actual carrying on public property requires the permit. Similar to the full permit, carrying at public events is prohibited.\n\n"}

Brown\n\nHarold Pitney Brown (September 16, 1857, Janesville, Wisconsin – 1944 Volusia, Florida) was an American electrical engineer and inventor known for his activism in the late 1880s against the use of alternating current for electric lighting in New York City and around the country (during the \"War of Currents\").\n\nBrown was mostly self-educated, working for several companies in the fledgling electrical field before striking out on his own, working on his own inventions as well as hiring himself out as a consultant.\n\nAfter several deaths were caused by alternating current arc lighting lines in New York City, Brown came to prominence in June 1888, claiming in the press and then in public meetings that AC was more deadly than direct current and that the arc lighting companies were cutting corners and using AC to save money at the cost of public safety. He conducted public demonstrations (electrocuting animals with AC) then lobbied around the country trying to limit AC transmission line voltages to 300 volts, tactics which had him using the press to directly attack the country's largest AC equipment manufacturer, Westinghouse Electric. He also pushed to have the first electric chair, which was being developed by the state of New York, be powered with AC current, provided by Westinghouse generators he had surreptitiously acquired. His involvement in these events is controversial since he was working parallel with (some documents show colluded with) Thomas Edison, showing a preference for Edison's direct current power system and advocating for severe restrictions on AC power systems that would put Edison's competitors at a disadvantage.\n\nHarold P Brown was born in Janesville, Wisconsin on September 16, 1857, the son of General Theodore F. Brown and Frances Brown. His father was in the American Civil War and received an honorary rank of brigadier general for his role in the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain.\n\nHarold Brown graduated Chicago High School in 1876 and prepared to enroll in mining engineering courses at Harvard but was unable to since the great Chicago fire of 1871 had left his family in reduced circumstances. After high school he was employed at the Western Electric Manufacturing Company of Chicago working on development and manufacturing of electrical devices, including Edison's electric pen duplicating machine, from 1876 to 1879. From 1879 to 1884 he worked for Brush Electric Company in charge of designing and installing their arc lighting systems. From 1884 to 1887 he operated his own electrical consulting business, Brown Electric Company, where he worked in inventing improved arc lighting equipment.\n\nBrown moved to New York in 1887 and worked as consultant for the New York and Westchester Railroad, Edison General Electric, and consulted on the development of the electric chair with Governor David B. Hill and the State of New York. He also did consulting work for the City of Newark, Dayton Ohio Buffalo Electric Rail Line, and the Louisville Electric Rail Line. Up through 1912 he invented and manufactured a plastic rail bond electric contact alloy and went on to invent and manufactured a method of applying concrete with compressed air or steam.\n\nBrown was awarded the Edward Longstreth Medal of the Franklin Institute in 1899.\n\nAfter a series of deaths in New York caused by the tangle of pole mounted high voltage (up to 6000 volt) alternating current lines Brown came to public prominence when he wrote a letter to the \"New York Post\" on June 5, 1888 describing the overhead lines as a public menace stating:\n\nThe only excuse for the use of the fatal alternating current is that it saves the company operating it [AC] from spending a larger sum of money for the heavier copper wires which are required by the safe incandescent systems. That is, the public must submit to constant danger from sudden death, in order that a corporation may pay a little larger dividend.\n\nHis crusade brought him to the attention of inventor Thomas Edison who was becoming engaged in a propaganda campaign against alternating current companies including Westinghouse Electric Company in what would come to be called the War of currents. Edison lent Brown the uses of his West Orange, New Jersey laboratory to prove his claims against alternating current.\n\nAfter much experimentation killing a series of dogs, Brown held a public demonstration on July 30 in a lecture room at Columbia College where he demonstrated that up to 1000 volts of DC would not kill a dog while 300 volts of AC would kill. He went on to support legislation to control and severely limit AC installations and voltages (to the point of making it an ineffective power delivery system). The legislation was unsuccessful but another bill to move AC lines underground in New York City, put forward before Brown's campaign, passed in 1889 after a further series of highly publicized deaths that year caused by alternating current.\n\nAt the same time that Brown was campaigning against alternating current a New York state bill replacing hanging with electrocution was signed into law (June 4, 1888) and set to go into effect on January 1, 1889. A Buffalo, New York dentist named Alfred P. Southwick had been developing a method using a device similar to a dental chair, an execution device referred to as the electric chair. The law did not specify the type of current to use, or the means, so the New York Medico-Legal Society, an informal society composed of doctors and lawyers, was given the task of working out the details. Committee head Frederick Peterson, a neurologist who had assisted in the dog electrocutions at Columbia College, enlisted Brown's services as a consultant. Brown set up an experiment at Edison's West Orange laboratory on December 5, 1888 with members of the press, members of the Medico-Legal Society, the chairman of the death penalty commission, and Thomas Edison looking on. Brown used alternating current for all of his tests on animals larger than a human, including 4 calves and a lame horse, all dispatched with 750 volts of AC. Based on these results the Medico-Legal Society recommended the use of 1000-1500 volts of alternating current for executions and newspapers noted the AC used was half the voltage used in the power lines over the streets of American cities.\n\nWestinghouse criticized this test as a skewed self-serving demonstration by Brown, who was again accused of being in the employ of Edison. Brown refuted the claims and even challenged Westinghouse to an electrical \"duel,\" with Brown agreeing to be shocked by ever increasing amounts of DC power if Westinghouse would submit himself to the same amount of increasing AC power (first to quit loses). Westinghouse declined the offer.\n\nNeither Edison, Westinghouse, nor Westinghouse's chief AC rival, Thomson-Houston Electric Company, wanted their equipment to be used in an execution but Brown colluded with Edison Electric and Thomson-Houston to surreptitiously acquire three Westinghouse AC generators to power the first electric chair.\n\nBrown would continually claim he had no actual association with Edison although an August 1889 \"New York Sun\" story published letters stolen from Brown's office that seemed to show Brown was receiving directions from, and being paid by, the Edison company as well as Thomson-Houston, including the story on the acquisition of the Westinghouse AC generators.\n\n\n"}

He was arrested for violating his federal probation in December 2012, when he left the Eastern District of the state of Pennsylvania without permission. He allegedly drove to Connecticut and impersonated the uncle of Adam Lanza, the shooter in the Sandy Hook Elementary School incident.\n\nSince January 8, 2006, he has filed over 2600 lawsuits in federal district courts across the country, some of which have received considerable press attention. Among the more famous defendants of his lawsuits are New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick, former President of the United States George W.

He also sued the late Benazir Bhutto, Pervez Musharraf, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service on November 7, 2007, to prevent him from being deported to Pakistan and tortured upon his release from prison in March 2012. There is no evidence beyond this lawsuit of any attempt to deport Riches.\n\nOn April 9, 2008, Riches filed a request for a temporary restraining order in a US District Court against \"Grand Theft Auto\" publisher Take-Two, developer Rockstar Games, FCI Williamsburg, and \"Grand Theft Auto\" itself, claiming that the defendants \"put me in prison.\" The inmate stated, \"Defendants contributed to Plaintiff committing identity theft.

Willis Hunt, the U.S. District Court Judge who dismissed Riches' suit against Vick as \"farcical,\" opined that his lawsuits were clearly self-promotional. As per 28 U.S. Code § 1915(g), he is barred from proceeding in forma pauperis.\n\nIn July 2018, Riches was indicted by a federal grand jury in Arizona.

Such a person can work as an academic, legal writer or law lecturer. In the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and in many other Commonwealth countries, the word \"jurist\" sometimes refers to a barrister, whereas in the United States of America and Canada it often refers to a judge. \n\nThus a \"jurist\", someone who studies, analyses and comments on law, stands in contrast with a \"lawyer\", someone who applies law on behalf of clients and thinks about it in practical terms.\n\nThere is a fundamental difference between the work of a lawyer and that of a jurist. Many legal scholars and authors have explained that a person may be both a lawyer and a jurist, but a jurist is not necessarily a lawyer, nor a lawyer necessarily a jurist. Both must possess an acquaintance with the term \"law\". The work of the jurist is the study, analysis and arrangement of the law—work which can be done wholly in the seclusion of the library. The work of the lawyer is the satisfaction of the wishes of particular human beings for legal assistance—work which requires dealing to some extent therefore with people in the office, in the court room, or in the market-place.\n\nThe term \"jurist \"has another sense, which is wider, synonymous with \"legal professional\", i.e. anyone professionally involved with law and justice.

{"id": "1332341", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1332341", "title": "Natural building", "text": "Natural building\n\nA natural building involves a range of building systems and materials that place major emphasis on sustainability. Ways of achieving sustainability through natural building focus on durability and the use of minimally processed, plentiful or renewable resources, as well as those that, while recycled or salvaged, produce healthy living environments and maintain indoor air quality. Natural building tends to rely on human labor, more than technology. As Michael G. Smith observes, it depends on \"local ecology, geology and climate; on the character of the particular building site, and on the needs and personalities of the builders and users.\"\n\nThe basis of natural building is the need to lessen the environmental impact of buildings and other supporting systems, without sacrificing comfort or health. To be more sustainable, natural building uses primarily abundantly available, renewable, reused or recycled materials. The use of rapidly renewable materials is increasingly a focus. In addition to relying on natural building materials, the emphasis on the architectural design is heightened. The orientation of a building, the utilization of local climate and site conditions, the emphasis on natural ventilation through design, fundamentally lessen operational costs and positively impact the environment. Building compactly and minimizing the ecological footprint is common, as are on-site handling of energy acquisition, on-site water capture, alternate sewage treatment and water reuse.\nThe materials common to many types of natural building are clay and sand. When mixed with water and, usually, straw or another fiber, the mixture may form \"cob\" or \"adobe\" (clay blocks). Other materials commonly used in natural building are: earth (as rammed earth or earth bag), wood (cordwood or timber frame/post-and-beam), straw, rice-hulls, bamboo and stone. A wide variety of reused or recycled non-toxic materials are common in natural building, including urbanite (salvaged chunks of used concrete), vehicle windscreens and other recycled glass.\n\nOther materials are avoided by practitioners of this building approach, due to their major negative environmental or health impacts. These include unsustainably harvested wood, toxic wood-preservatives, portland cement-based mixes and derived products such as Autoclaved aerated concrete, paints and other coatings that off-gas volatile organic compounds (VOCs), steel, waste materials such as rubber tires in regions where they are recycled, and some plastics; particularly polyvinyl chloride (PVC or \"vinyl\") and those containing harmful plasticizers or hormone-mimicking formulations.\n\nMany traditional techniques and materials are now experiencing a resurgence of popularity. This differs around the world based on climate appropriate building design and the availability of local materials.\n\nOne of the oldest building methods, adobe is simply clay and sand mixed with water. Often, chopped straw or other fibers are added for strength. The mixture is then allowed to dry in the desired shape. Usually adobe is shaped into bricks that can be stacked to form walls.\n\nVarious claims are made about the optimal proportions of clay and sand (or larger aggregate). Some say that the best adobe soil contains 15% - 30% clay to bind the material together. Others say equal proportions of clay and sand are best to prevent cracking or fragmenting of the bricks. The blocks can either be poured into molds and dried, or pressed into blocks. Adobe colored with clay and polished with natural oil makes an attractive and resilient floor.\n\nTo protect the walls and reduce maintenance, adobe buildings usually have large overhanging eaves and sizeable foundations. Adobe can be plastered over with cob or lime-based mixes for both appearance and protection. Adobe has good thermal mass, meaning that it is slow to transmit heat or cold. It is not a good insulator, however, so insulation can be added (preferably on the outside), or a double wall built with airspace or insulation in between. The traditional thick, un-insulated adobe has proven to perform best in regions without harsh winters or where daily sun is predictably available during those cold periods.\n\nThe term \"cob\" is used to describe a monolithic building system based on a mixture of clay, sand, straw and earth. The construction uses no forms, bricks or wooden framework; it is built from the ground up. Various forms of \"mud\" building have been used in many parts of the world for centuries, under a variety of names, and date from at least 10,000 years ago. Cob building began use in England prior to the 13th century, and fell out of favor after World War I, although it is seeing a resurgence today. Cob is one of the simplest and least expensive building techniques available, though it is typically very labor-intensive. Cob's other great advantage is versatility; It can easily be shaped into any form. While cob building was falling out of favor in England by the late 19th century, thousands of cob structures have endured to the present (20,000 in Devon, England alone). It is estimated that from one third to one half of the world's population lives in earthen dwellings today. Although typically associated with \"low-rise\" structures, in Yemen and other Middle-Eastern countries it has, for centuries, been used in \"apartment\" buildings of eight stories and more.\n\nCob-like mixes are also used as plaster or filler in several methods of natural building, such as adobe, earth bags, timber frames, cordwood, and straw bales. Earth is thus a primary ingredient of natural building.\n\nCordwood construction is a term used for a natural building method in which \"cordwood\" or short lengths of pieces of debarked tree are laid up crosswise with masonry or cob mixtures to build a wall. The cordwood, thus, becomes infill for the walls, usually between posts in a timber frame structure. Cordwood masonry can be combined with other methods (e.g., rammed earth, cob or light clay) to produce attractive combinations. Cordwood masonry construction provides a relatively high thermal mass, which helps to minimise fluctuations in temperature.\n\nEarth is the most typical fill material used in bag-wall construction techniques. This building method utilizes stacked polypropylene or natural-fiber (burlap) bags filled with earth or other mixes without a stabilizer, other than clay, to form footings, foundations, walls and even vaulted or domed roofs. In recent years, building with earth bags has become one of the increasingly practiced techniques in natural building. It facilitates self-contained, often free-form rammed-earth structures. Its growing popularity relates to its use of an abundant and readily available often site-available material (earth) in a potentially inexpensive building technique that is flexible, and easy to learn and use. However, because earth is a poor insulator, in more extreme climates other filler variations are now being explored, substituting pumice, rice-hulls or another material with better insulating value for all or part of the earth (\"see also\" Rice-hull bagwall construction).\n\nHempcrete or Hemplime is bio-composite material, a mixture of hemp hurds (shives) and lime (possibly including natural hydraulic lime, sand, pozzolans) used as a material for construction and insulation. It is marketed under names like Hempcrete, Canobiote, Canosmose, and Isochanvre. Hempcrete is easier to work with than traditional lime mixes and acts as an insulator and moisture regulator. It lacks the brittleness of concrete and consequently does not need expansion joints. The result is a lightweight insulating material ideal for most climates as it combines insulation and thermal mass.\n\nLike other plant products, hemp absorbs CO from the atmosphere as it grows, retaining the carbon and releasing the oxygen. Theoretically 165 kg of carbon can be absorbed and locked up by 1 m of hempcrete wall during manufacture. Furthermore the carbonation of the lime during curing adds to this effect as lime turns to limestone.\n\nThe typical compressive strength is around 1 MPa, around 1/20 that of residential grade concrete. It is a low density material and resistant to crack under movement thus making it highly suitable for use in earthquake-prone areas. Hempcrete walls must be used together with a frame of another material that supports the vertical load in building construction, as hempcrete's density is 15% that of traditional concrete.\n\nRammed earth is a wall system made of compacted earth, or another material that is compacted. It is extremely strong and durable. Quality rammed earth walls are dense, solid, and stone-like with great environmental benefits and superior low maintenance characteristics. As an option depending on climate rigid insulation can be placed inside the wall. Similarly, depending on seismic concerns bamboo or other tensile natural materials can be used to reinforce the wall.\n\nRammed earth has been used for around 10,000 years in all types of buildings from low rise to high-rise and from small huts to palaces.\n\nRammed earth walls are formed in place by pounding damp sub-soil (containing sand, clay and sometimes gravel) into movable, reusable forms with manual or machine-powered tampers. In traditional rammed earth, a mixture of around 70% aggregate (gravel,sand) and 30% clay is optimal. Pigmentation may be added in the mix to achieve the desired color. Around 5-10 inches of mixed damp sub-soil are placed inside the forms and pounded to total compaction and the process is repeated until the desired height is achieved. What is left after the forms are removed is a wall that is structural and can last over 1000 years.\n\nStone has been used as a building material for thousands of years. It has long been recognized as a material of great durability. The pyramids in Giza, burial chambers in the UK and temples in Malta were all built from stone over 4000 years ago and are still standing. The earliest form of stone construction is known as dry stone, or dry stacking. These are freestanding structures such as field walls, bridges and buildings that use irregularly shaped stones carefully selected and placed so that they fit closely together without slipping. Structures are typically wider at the base and taper in as height increases. They do not require any special tools, only the skill of the craftsman in choosing and placing the stones.\n\nTraditional stone masonry evolved from dry stone stacking. Stone blocks are laid in rows of even (courses) or uneven (un-coursed) height, and fixed in place with lime mortar pasted between the stones. Traditional stone masonry is rarely used today because stone is expensive to quarry, cut and transport, and the building process is labor and skill-intensive. \n\nStone is a highly durable, low maintenance building material with high thermal mass. It is versatile, available in many shapes, sizes, colors and textures, and can be used for floors, walls, arches and roofs. Stone blends well with the natural landscape, and can easily be recycled for other building purposes.\n\nAlthough grasses and straw have been in use in a range of ways in building since pre-history around the world, their incorporation in machine-manufactured modular bales seems to date back to the early 20th century in the midwestern United States, particularly the sand-hills of Nebraska, where grass was plentiful and other building materials (even quality sods) were not. Straw bale building typically consists of stacking a series of rows of bales (often in running-bond) on a raised footing or foundation, with a moisture barrier between. Bale walls are often tied together with pins of bamboo or wood (internal to the bales or on their faces), or with surface wire meshes, and then stuccoed or plastered using either lime-based formulations or earth/clay renders. Bale buildings can either have a structural frame of other materials, with bales between (simply serving as insulation and stucco substrate), referred to as \"infill\", or the bales may actually provide the support for openings and roof, referred to as \"load-bearing\" or \"Nebraska-style\", or a combination of framing and load-bearing may be employed, referred to a \"hybrid\" straw bale.\n\nTypically, bales created on farms with mobile machinery have been used (\"field-bales\"), but recently higher-density \"recompressed\" bales (or \"straw-blocks\") are increasing the loads that may be supported; where field bales might support around 600 pounds per linear foot of wall, the high density bales bear up to 4,000 lb./lin.ft.\n\nThe basic elements of timber frame building—joined timbers, clay walls and thatch roofs were in place in Europe and Asia by the 9th century. It remained the common mode of house construction in northern cultures until the 19th century. Craftsmanship was, and is, an important value in timber frame building. The oldest timber frame structures (for example, the timber framed stave churches of Scandinavia) show both craftsmanship and a strong grasp of the technical aspects of structural design, as do such structures in Japan.\n\nTimber framing typically uses a \"bent.\" A bent is a structural support, like a truss, consisting of two posts, a tie beam and two rafters. These are connected into a framework through joinery. To practice the craft, one must understand the basic structural aspects of the bent. This, along with a knowledge of joinery, are the basis of timber frame building.\n\nTimber framing is now a modern method of construction, Ideally suited to mass house building as well as public buildings. In conjunction with a number of natural insulations and timber cladding or modern lime renders, it is possible to quickly construct a high performance, sustainable building, using completely natural products. The benefits are many—the building performs better over its lifespan, waste is reduced (much can be re-cycled, composted or used as fuel). Timber frame structures are frequently used in combination with other natural building techniques, such as cob, straw bale, or cordwood/masonry.\n\n\n\n"}

Nominative use may be considered to be either related to, or a type of \"trademark fair use\" (sometimes called \"classic fair use\" or \"statutory fair use\"). All \"trademark fair use\" doctrines, however classified, are distinct from the fair use doctrine in copyright law. However, the fair use of a trademark may be protected under copyright laws depending on the complexity or creativity of the mark as a design logo.\n\nThe nominative use test essentially states that one party may use or refer to the trademark of another if:\n\n\nFurthermore, if a use is found to be nominative, then by the definition of non-trademark uses, it can not dilute the trademark.\n\nNominative use does \"not\" require that ownership of the trademark be acknowledged, for example by use of a sentence such as \"UNIX is a registered trademark of The Open Group\". Such statements may, however, be required by the terms of a license agreement between the parties, and they may be prudent (and courteous) as a way of preventing misunderstandings or allegations of passing off.\n\nThe nominative use doctrine was first enunciated in 1992 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in \"New Kids on the Block v. News America Publishing, Inc.\". In \"New Kids on the Block\", the court had examined a \"New Kids on the Block survey\" performed by the defendant, and found that there was no way to ask people their opinion of the band without using its name. For instance, one could refer to the Minnesota Twins as \"that professional baseball team from Minnesota,\" but it is much more acceptable to just refer to them by their trade name.\n\nITn \"Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Welles\", where Playboy Playmate Terri Welles was sued for using the trademarked term \"Playmate of the Year\" in a meta keyword within the HTML code of her website. The court found that Welles had to use the term to completely describe herself, as she had been given that title by the trademark holder. In other words, individuals are not compelled by trademark law to use \"absurd turns of phrase\" simply to avoid trademark liability. \n\nIn \"New Kids\" and in \"Playboy v. Welles\", the courts examined older cases, identifying a unifying principle that they then named \"nominative use\". Among the older cases cited by the Court in \"Playboy v. Welles\" was \"Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. Church\", in which the Ninth Circuit had ruled that an independent auto repair shop that specialized in repairing Volkswagen cars and mentioned that fact in their advertising was not liable for trademark infringement so long as they did not claim or imply that they had any business relationship with the Volkswagen company. In the case of \"Yue v. MSC Software Corporation\",\nthe Northern District of California held that the nominative fair use defense is a burden-shifting defense properly decided at the summary judgment stage and would be premature to raise in a motion to dismiss.\n\n"}

The \"post-\" may refer to after the end of secularism or after the beginning of secularism.\n\nThe term “postsecular” has been used in sociology, political theory, religious studies, art studies, literary studies, education and other fields. Jürgen Habermas is widely credited for popularizing the term, to refer to current times in which the idea of modernity is perceived as failing and, at times, morally unsuccessful, so that, rather than a stratification or separation, a new peaceful dialogue and tolerant coexistence between the spheres of faith and reason must be sought in order to learn mutually. In this sense, Habermas insists that both religious people and secularist people should not exclude each other, but to learn from one another and coexist tolerantly. Massimo Rosati says that in a post secular society, religious and secular perspectives are on even ground, meaning that the two theoretically share equal importance. Modern societies that have considered themselves fully secular until recently have to change their value systems accordingly as to properly accommodate this co-existence.\n\nCharles Taylor’s \"A Secular Age\" is also frequently invoked as describing the postsecular, though there is sometimes disagreement over what each author meant with the term. Particularly contested is the question of whether “postsecular” refers to a new sociological phenomenon or to a new awareness of an existing phenomenon—that is, whether society was secular and now is becoming post-secular or whether society was never and is not now becoming secular even though many people had thought it was or thought it was going to be. Some suggest that the term is so conflicted as to be of little use. Others suggest that the flexibility of the term is one of its strengths.\n\nIn literary studies, the term has been used to indicate a sort of postmodern religious or spiritual sensibility in certain contemporary texts.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "37730674", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37730674", "title": "Revolt of the Lash", "text": "Revolt of the Lash\n\nThe Revolt of the Lash () was a naval mutiny in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in late November 1910. It was the direct result of the use of whips (\"lashes\") by white naval officers when punishing Afro-Brazilian and mulatto enlisted sailors.\n\nIn 1888, Brazil became the last country in the Western Hemisphere to abolish slavery. The move was opposed by Brazilian elites, and they led a successful \"coup d'état\" in 1889. The resulting instability contributed to several revolts and rebellions, but at the beginning of the new century rising demand for coffee and rubber enabled Brazilian politicians to begin plotting the country's transformation into an international power. A key part of this would come from modernizing the Brazilian Navy, which had been neglected since the revolution, by purchasing battleships of the new \"dreadnought\" type. While enormously expensive, these two dreadnoughts garnered before their delivery in 1910.\n\nSocial conditions in the Brazilian Navy, however, were not keeping pace with the new technology. Elite white officers were in charge of mostly black and mulatto crews, many of whom had been forced into the navy on long-term contracts. These officers frequently utilized corporal punishment on their crewmen for even minor offenses, something that had been banned in most other countries and in the rest of Brazil. In response, sailors used the new warships for a carefully planned and executed mutiny on 22 November 1910. They took control of both new dreadnoughts, one of the cruisers and an older warship—a total that gave the mutineers the kind of firepower that dwarfed the rest of the Brazilian Navy. Led by João Cândido Felisberto, the mutineers sent a letter to the government that demanded an end to what they called the \"slavery\" being practiced by the navy.\n\nWhile the executive branch of the Brazilian government plotted to retake or sink the rebelling warships, they were hampered by personnel distrust and equipment problems; historians have since cast doubt on their chances of successfully accomplishing either. At the same time, Congress—led by Rui Barbosa, a senator—pursued a route of amnesty, appointing a former navy captain as their liaison to the rebels. This latter route was successful, and a bill granting amnesty to all involved and ending the use of corporal punishment passed the lower house by a veto-proof margin. However, many of the sailors were quickly discharged from the navy, and after an unrelated second rebellion took place a few weeks later, many of the original mutineers were rounded up and thrown into jail or sent to work camps on the rubber plantations to the north.\n\nIn the years preceding the revolt, the Brazilian populace saw frequent changes in the country's political, economic, and social climate. For example, in May 1888, slavery in Brazil was abolished with the enactment into law of the \"Lei Áurea\", a law vehemently opposed by the Brazilian upper class and plantation owners. This discontent among the upper parts of society directly led to a peaceful \"coup d'état\" spearheaded by the army and led by Benjamin Constant and Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca. Pedro II and his family were quickly and quietly sent into exile in Europe; they were replaced with a titular republic with Fonseca as president.\n\nThe next decade was marked by several rebellions against the new political order, including naval revolts (1891, 1893–94), the Federalist Rebellion (1893–95), the War of Canudos (1896–97), and the Vaccine Revolt (1904), during which the quality of the Brazilian Navy severely declined relative to its neighbors thanks to an Argentine–Chilean naval arms race. By the turn of the twentieth century, an antiquated Brazilian naval fleet with just forty-five percent of its authorized personnel (in 1896) and only two modern armored warships could be faced by Argentine and Chilean navies filled with ships ordered in the last decade.\n\nAlso at the dawn of the new century, however, rising demand for coffee and rubber gave the Brazilian government an influx of revenue. Contemporary writers estimated that seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's coffee supply was grown in Brazil. Prominent Brazilian politicians, most notably Pinheiro Machado and the Baron of Rio Branco, moved to have the country recognized as an international power, as they believed that the short-term windfall would continue. A strong navy was seen as crucial to this goal. The National Congress of Brazil drew up and passed a large naval acquisition program in late 1904, but it was two years before any ships were ordered. While they first ordered three small battleships, the launch of the revolutionary British \"Dreadnought\"—which heralded a new and powerful type of warship—caused the Brazilians to cancel their order in favor of two dreadnoughts. These ships would be named and , and would be accompanied by two smaller cruisers, and , and ten destroyers of the \"Pará\" class.\n\nThis technological modernization in the Brazilian Navy was not matched by social change, and tensions between the Brazilian Navy's officer core versus the regular crewmembers kindled much unrest. A quote from the Baron of Rio Branco, the esteemed politician and professional diplomat, shows one of the sources of tension: \"For the recruitment of marines and enlisted men, we bring aboard the dregs of our urban centers, the most worthless lumpen, without preparation of any sort. Ex-slaves and the sons of slaves make up our ships' crews, most of them dark-skinned or dark-skinned mulattos.\" Racial differences in the Brazilian Navy would have been immediately apparent to an observer at the time: the officers in charge of the ship were nearly all white, while the crews were heavily black or, to a lesser extent, mulatto. The visual differences belied deeper distinctions: darker-skinned crewmen, who by the time of the revolt would have been older slaves freed under the \"Lei Áurea\" (or sons born free under the 1871 Law of the Free Womb), were almost universally less educated than their white overseers.\n\nThe navy, along with other military branches, served as dumping grounds for thousands of young, poverty-stricken, sometimes orphaned black individuals who were stuck in the 'dregs' of Brazil's cities. Many had committed or were suspected of committing crimes—though those not in legal trouble were far from safe, as some recruits were seized off the streets or simply on the losing end of settling a personal score. Such measures served as a \"perfect marriage of punishment and reform\": people who had or were likely to commit crimes would be removed from society and trained in skills that would benefit the country. These men were commonly sent to the navy, apprenticed around the age of 14, and bound to the navy for fifteen years. João Cândido Felisberto, a leader in the later Revolt of the Lash, was apprenticed at age 13 and joined the navy at 16. Individuals forced into the navy served for twelve years. Volunteers, who perhaps unsurprisingly made up a very low percentage of recruits, signed on for nine years.\n\nAnother point of contention came from the navy's heavy use of corporal punishment for even minor offenses. While such measures had been banned in the general population since the Imperial Constitution of 1824 and in the army since 1874, the navy was only affected in November 1889, when the new republic's legislature forbade such discipline. They rescinded the law less than a year later amid widespread noncompliance. Instead, corporal punishment would only be allowed in a \"Companhia Correcional\" (Correctional Company). The legislature envisioned this as a curb on the practice, as only sailors with violent or subversive histories would face the lash. The reality was very different: because the companies existed anywhere on the ships, any sailor could be theoretically transferred to the \"Companhia Correcional\" but not have any change in their daily routines.\n\nMost of the Brazilian Navy's officer corps believed that corporal punishment was an essential tool in maintaining discipline on their ships. An anonymous Brazilian admiral, representative of his time, wrote in 1961 that \"... our seamen of that time, lacking the moral and intellectual requirements for appreciating the debasing aspects of the punishment [whipping], accepted it naturally, as an opportunity to show their physical and moral superiority. ... All this is ... understandable in the face of the backward mentality and ignorance of the personnel that composed the ship's crews.\"\n\nCrewmen aboard \"Minas Geraes\" began planning for a revolt years before 1910, according to João Cândido Felisberto, an experienced sailor who would later become the leader of the Revolt of the Lash. The conspirators were motivated by the treatment of enlisted men in the Brazilian Navy, extending beyond the lash to even their substandard food, which led to not-uncommon outbreaks of beriberi. Some had formed a committee and had been meeting secretly for years in Rio de Janeiro. This semi-formal organization was only expanded when they were sent to Newcastle in the United Kingdom for training—the operation of such large and complex warships required specific skills. When interviewed years after the mutiny, Felisberto said that they \"maintained the committees in the very hotels where we were residing, awaiting the construction of the ships. Almost two years paid by the Brazilian government, we sent messengers to sound out the situation here [in Brazil]. We did this so that when we arrive, we would be prepared to act\"—they were just \"waiting for a date and for power,\" referring to the brand-new warships.\n\nThe experience of these crewmen in the UK was such that historian Zachary Morgan believes that it was a pivotal formative period in shaping the later mutiny. The sailors were paid on time, in cash, and received extra money because they had to buy their own meals; because of the vital role these sailors played in Newcastle's local economy, they faced comparatively little racism; and the Armstrong shipyard workers unionized and even successfully went on strike during this time, delaying the completion of the new Brazilian warships. Moreover, they were able to observe their British Royal Navy counterparts—an experience that Morgan says would have been \"jarring\" because these sailors \"were no longer impressed, no longer lashed, [and] were accepted as citizens.\"\n\nThe revolt started shortly after the brutal 250 lashes given to Marcelino Rodrigues Menezes, a regular Afro-Brazilian enlisted sailor, for deliberately injuring a fellow seaman with a shaving razor. There is some scholarly disagreement on if this number is correct and exactly when this sentence was carried out, but all agree that it was the immediate catalyst. A later Brazilian government observer, former navy captain José Carlos de Carvalho, told the president of Brazil that Menezes' back looked like \"a mullet sliced open for salting.\"\n\nA significant percentage of the naval crewmen stationed in Rio de Janeiro, perhaps 1,500 to 2,000 out of 4,000, revolted at around 10 pm on 22 November. They began aboard \"Minas Geraes\", where the ship's commander and several loyal crewmen were killed, and the gunfire on board the dreadnought alerted the other ships in the harbor that the revolt had begun. By midnight, the rebels had \"São Paulo\", the new cruiser \"Bahia\", and the coast-defense ship all under control, with the \"Admiral\" João Cândido Felisberto in overall command.\n\nThe crews aboard the smaller minelayer , the training ship , and the torpedo boats and all revolted as well, but they made up only two percent of the overall mutineers. The majority of \"República\"s crew left to bolster \"São Paulo\" and \"Deodoro\"; those aboard the other ships either joined with the rebels or fled ashore.\n\nWhile officers were typically allowed to leave their ships—with two notable exceptions—civilian technicians (some of them British), machinists, and other integral crewmen were not given the same opportunity. These exceptions came on \"Minas Geraes\", whose officers were surprised but had time to draw their weapons and defend themselves. The ship's captain, , was killed in the fighting along with several loyal and rebel crewmen. Any other bloodshed was much more limited: on the cruiser \"Bahia\", the only officer aboard was killed after he shot a rebel crewman, and one lieutenant on \"São Paulo\" killed himself.\n\nBy the end of the evening, key warships that remained in government hands included \"Bahia\"s sister , the aging cruiser , and the new destroyers of the \"Pará\" class. Their potential power, however, was dwarfed by the dreadnoughts—each of which outgunned all of the warships alone—and was severely tempered by personnel issues. First, naval officers were suspicious of even the enlisted men who remained loyal to the government. Officers took over all of the positions that would be involved in direct combat, and the numbers of enlisted men were reduced wherever possible. Further complicating matters were missing weapon components, such as the destroyer's torpedoes, which could not be fired without firing caps, yet the caps were not where they were supposed to be. When caps were finally located and delivered, they did not fit the newer torpedoes carried by the destroyers. The correct caps were fitted only two days after the rebellion began.\n\nBefore midnight on 22 November, the rebels sent a telegraph to the president, reading \"We do not want the return of the \"chibata\" [lash]. This we ask the President of the republic and the Minister of the Navy. We want an immediate response. If we do not receive such a response, we will destroy the city and the ships that are not revolting.\" Fonseca, however, refused to allow any direct contact between himself and the mutineers. Instead, the rebel force moved to Ilha do Viana at 1 am on 23 November to coal and take on supplies to guard against the possibility of an extended siege. After the sun rose, the bodies of the dead sailors from \"Minas Geraes\" were sent on a launch to Ilha das Cobras, along with a letter from João Cândido Felisberto—who was in command of the rebel armada—and his fellow sailors to the Brazilian president Hermes da Fonseca, the nephew of the first president who had been in office for only one week. It included a demand for the end of the 'slavery' being practiced by the navy—most notably the continued use of the lash despite its ban in every other Western nation:\n\nDuring the same morning, the rebel ships fired on several army forts located around Guanabara Bay, along with the naval arsenal and bases on Ilha das Cobras and Villegagnon Island, Niterói, and the presidential palace. One shell hit a home on Castello Hill, killing two children; while there may have been other casualties, the deaths of these children clearly weighed on the rebels' consciences. Felisberto still remembered them decades later, where in an interview he stated that he and his crewmen collected money from their \"miserable pay\" to pay to bury the children.\n\nBroadly speaking, however, it appears that the ships were well-handled and commanded. Contemporary observers were surprised to note that the crewmen, despite lacking white officers, had complete control of their warships and were able to stay in good formation as they circled around the bay. The rebels favored firing over the city or around government-controlled military targets rather than outright destruction, something that Zachary Morgan believes was motivated by either humanitarian concerns or (at the very least) pragmatism—by limiting the actual damage, they could gain support among legislators, the press, and general population. This has, however, caused a historiographical argument among scholars that persists to this day.\n\nOnshore, civilians woke on the morning of 23 November to find that the most powerful ships in their navy, crewed by the lowest of the underclass, were firing on the city. Thousands quickly fled, although nearly all were unable to. The press initially stoked these peoples' fears, although they later flipped to lionizing the rebels, portraying them as heroes.\n\nFonseca and the navy's high command were faced with two extremely unpalatable choices. They could use the government-controlled ships to attack and possibly destroy the rebel ships, but doing so would mean destroying three incredibly expensive ships that had received significant global attention and were—in their eyes—a crucial part of refashioning Brazil as a serious international power. Worse, there was a significant chance that the remaining Brazilian ships, all of which were smaller and much older than the ships controlled by the mutineers, would lose if it came to open combat. But by folding and giving into the rebel's list of demands—that is, demands from the underclass and broadly black naval crews—the elites would suffer an incredible embarrassment.\n\nFonseca chose both. First, the Brazilian Congress began negotiating with the mutineers, although this was not Fonseca's preferred solution—he and the Minister of the Navy Marques Leão began plotting a military solution. At the behest of Congress, José Carlos de Carvalho was appointed as a liaison to the rebels. Carvalho, a federal deputy and former naval captain, talked with the crew on all four ships and reported to Congress that the rebels were well led and organized—and their main armament was fully functional. His report showed that the sailor's complaints, especially about the lash, were well-justified and that a military option would be unlikely to succeed. By the afternoon on 23 November, the Brazilian Congress had begun work on a bill that would grant amnesty to all involved and end the use of corporal punishment in the navy.\nPressed by his navy minister, Forseca did not yet give up on the military option. On the same afternoon, the rebels received an illicit telegram warning from the government-held destroyer that they were planning to attack. In response, the rebels moved outside of the bay for the evening in an attempt to make any torpedo-led assault more difficult. They returned on 24 November at 10 am, a day where \"Correio da Manhã\" was the first press source to refer to Felisberto as the \"admiral\" of the rebel fleet. They later noted:\n\nIn Congress, the influential senator and losing presidential candidate Rui Barbosa championed the rebels' cause. Barbosa used the navy official's rhetoric against them in arguing for a diplomatic solution, noting that if the new dreadnoughts were as unsinkable as they claimed, the remaining warships in government hands would certainly not be able to force a military victory. Furthermore, he argued, if such an attack had the support of Congress and failed, any resulting destruction of Rio de Janeiro would be held at fault. These arguments won Barbosa much support in the Senate, so much so that the body began working on an amnesty that would absolve the mutineers of all criminal charges once the ships were turned back over to the government. After hours of debate, the bill was passed unanimously that day and sent to the lower Chamber of Deputies on 25 November.\n\nNaval leaders disagreed and continued planning for a military confrontation. Zachary Morgan writes that \"naval leaders believed that only a military confrontation with the rebels would restore their lost honor,\" and that any such action would have to take place before an amnesty was approved. That left very little time. The aforementioned armament and personnel problems handicapped the government ships; an attempt to procure the necessary torpedoes were foiled by \"Deodoro\"s guns. When night fell on 23 November, radio messages about available torpedoes to the government destroyers, huddled for protection, did not reach the ships. They were only able to obtain these weapons on 24 November, and during that night, Fonseca ordered them to attack the rebel ships. However, they were not given the chance to attack, as the rebel armada did not return to Guanabara Bay until the amnesty was passed by Congress. It is not known if the rebels were warned or were simply taking defensive precautions.\n\nThe amnesty was passed by the Chamber of Deputies by a vote of 125–23. Under the threat of having a veto overridden, Fonseca signed the amnesty. The rebels returned on 26 November after a short period of consternation—additional demands, such as an increase in salary, had yet to be proposed in Congress, much less passed—with their ships in formation, \"Minas Geraes\" leading \"São Paulo\", with \"Bahia\" and \"Deodoro\" to each side. By 7 pm, the mutineers officially accepted the amnesty provisions.\n\nIn the aftermath of the revolt, the two Brazilian dreadnoughts were disarmed by the removal of their guns' breechblocks. The revolt and consequent state of the navy, which was essentially unable to operate for fear of another rebellion, caused many leading Brazilians, including the president, prominent politicians like Barbosa and the Baron of Rio Branco, and the editor of the most respected newspaper in Brazil, \"Jornal do Commercio\", to question the use of the new ships and support their sale to a foreign country. The British ambassador to Brazil, W.H.D. Haggard, was ecstatic at Rio Branco's about-face, saying \"This is indeed a wonderful surrender on the part of the man who was answerable for the purchase and who looked upon them as the most cherished offspring of his policy.\" Rui Barbosa was emphatic in his opposition to the ships in a speech given shortly before the vote on the amnesty bill:\n\nIn the end, the president and cabinet decided against selling the ships because of a fear of a consequent negative effect in domestic politics—even though they agreed that the ships should be disposed of, possibly to fund smaller warships capable of traversing Brazil's many rivers. The executive's apprehension was heightened by Barbosa's speech given before the revolt's end, as he also used the occasion to attack the government—what he called the \"brutal militaristic regime.\" Still, the Brazilians ordered Armstrong to cease working towards laying down a third \"Minas Geraes\"-class dreadnought, which induced the Argentine government to not pick up their contractual option for a third dreadnought. The United States' ambassador to Brazil cabled home to state that the Brazilian desire for naval preeminence in Latin America was quelled, although this proved to be short-lived.\n\nMeanwhile, the decision to extend an amnesty to the mutineer sailors engendered much criticism from Brazil's upper classes. As historian Zachary Morgan put it, \"for the elite, the intention of the naval renovation itself was to fix their institution, propelling Brazil to the front of a South American arms race, and to make their navy competitive with that of any Western nation. Instead, enlisted men had used those very ships to humiliate the naval elite. The ships were saved, but at what cost?\" These sailors were given shore leave on the day the revolt ended (26 November). In the next days, the ships were disarmed to prevent a recurrence of events, and the rebels were discharged from the navy as threats to the service's discipline—nearly 1,300 of them, a drop so drastic that the Brazilian Navy was forced to pay for Portuguese merchant crewmen to fill the gaps. The government later claimed that over 1,000 of the dismissed sailors were given tickets to their home states to get them out of the capital.\n\nThese rapid changes raised tensions between officers and their charges, and over thirty sailors were arrested in early December and accused of planning a new rebellion—which led to that feared second rebellion. On 9 December, crewmen onboard \"Rio Grande do Sul\", the only one of Brazil's major new warships to not take part in the Revolt of the Lash, mutinied but did not gain enough traction to take the ship. Shortly after, the marine infantry battalion at the naval facilities on Ilha das Cobras revolted. The government acted quickly and put down both rebellions, but they caused the Brazilian Congress to declare that Rio de Janeiro was in a state of siege, thereby giving President Fonseca a suite of tools to combat the unrest. The vote was nearly unanimous; the only vote against came from Rui Barbosa.\n\nHistorians now hold that there was likely no cross-pollination between the Revolt of the Lash and these subsequent revolts. The formerly mutinous \"Minas Geraes\", under the command of João Cândido after the officers abandoned the ship, used a hidden-away gun (as the ship had otherwise been disarmed after the Revolt of the Lash) to fire on the marine infantry and demonstrate their loyalty. Even so, the government and navy, fueled by anger over their lost honor, used this opportunity to round up the remaining amnestied sailors and put them in prison.\n\nSailors that did not escape, over 600 of them, were imprisoned on Ilha das Cobras, where João Cândido and seventeen others were transferred to an isolation cell. Of the eighteen, only two were left alive the next morning—the victim of a heat-producing chemical reaction between quicklime, used to disinfect the cell, and carbon dioxide. On the same day, a steamship named \"Satelite\" left Rio de Janeiro for the rubber plantations in the Amazon with over a hundred former sailors and nearly three hundred \"vagabonds\" on board. Nine were executed by the crew along the way, and many of the rest died shortly after while working in the hot tropical climate, conditions described by Rui Barbosa as \"a place where one only dies.\" Meanwhile, João Cândido—stricken by hallucinations from his traumatic night—was sentenced to a mental hospital. It took eighteen months before he and nine sailors faced trial for their supposed anti-government actions taken during the December 9–10 revolts; the judges found them not guilty, and all were discharged from the navy.\n\nFor the sailors that remained in or were joining the navy, conditions did not immediately change. Training programs had been instituted, especially in the maligned naval apprenticeship schools, that had started graduating literate sailors—a large step above previous practices. But these did not include the sailors already in the navy. An ambitious program was planned in 1911, not long after the revolt, but it was shelved when a new administration was put into place in 1912. The navy was instead left to fall into disrepair, not unlike what had happened in 1893. \"Rather than starting over by raising the level of sailors and officers to that of their technically advanced warships,\" Morgan writes, \"the ships that offered the promise of modernity to the Brazilian nation were allowed to deteriorate—as did the navy alongside them.\"\n\n\nBooks\n\nOther\n\n"}
{"id": "46466101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46466101", "title": "Right to personal identity", "text": "Right to personal identity\n\nThe right to personal identity is recognised in international law through a range of declarations and conventions. From as early as birth, an individual’s identity is formed and preserved by registration or being bestowed with a name. However, personal identity becomes more complex as an individual develops a conscience. But human rights exist to defend and protect individuality, as quoted by Professor Jill Marshall: \"Human rights law exist to ensure that individual lifestyle choices are protected from majoritarian or populist infringement.\" Despite the complexity of personal identity, it is preserved and encouraged through privacy, personality rights and the right to self-expression.\n\nThe right to personal identity begins with the right to life. It is only through existing that individuals can cultivate their identity. Nevertheless, since ancient Greek philosophy, humans have been recognised with a \"soul\", making them more than physical bone and flesh. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was created to preserve the biological and philosophical elements of human beings since its establishment in 1948. Therefore, the notion of individual identity and personality has been encouraged and preserved from the birth of human rights. However, throughout the years there have been developments towards the protection of personal identity through avenues that manifest identity such as private life, expression rights, personality rights and the right to know your biological origin.\n\nArticle 8 of the European Court of Human Rights has been interpreted to include \"personal identity\" within the meaning of \"private life.\" Article 8 protects against unwanted intrusion and provides for the respect of an individual's private space. Professor Marshall explains that this is important to be uninterrupted and to \"think reflectively without interference is to be in control of one’s own faculties,\" as Macklem puts it: \"independence of mind.\" This protection of inner privacy allows individuals to develop and cultivate their personal identity. \"Private life\" has also be interpreted to protect the development of relationships.The ECHR highlighted in the case of \"Bruggemann and Scheuten v Germany Yearbook\" the significance of relationships concerning the \"emotional field\" and \"the development of one’s own personality.\"\n\nWith respect of privacy comes respect for personal autonomy, which Article 8 has also been interpreted to protect. The ECHR Online states that the scope of Article 8 is to \"embrace personal autonomy\" and the freedom to make choices without the interference of the state to develop one’s own personal life. As illustrated by the Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy, through protecting a person’s autonomy, a person’s identity is also protected, as both are integral to each other.\n\nThe Declaration of Human Rights Article 19 and Article 10 of the ECHR give everyone the right to freedom of opinion and expression. Macklem explains that \"freedom of expression is not merely the freedom to communicate one’s voice to others. It is more importantly the freedom to develop a distinctive voice of one’s own.\" Therefore, Articles 19 and 10 encourage the manifestation of personal identity. In the case of \"Handyside v UK\" the court stated \"Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of such a society, one of the basic conditions for its progress and for the development of every man.\" Freedom of expression not only endorses individuals to participate and contribute to public life but it also gives them the opportunity to discover who they personally are.\n\nArticle 9 of the ECHR also provides the right to freedom (and the manifestation) of thought, conscience and religion. According to Locke, thought and consciousness establish personal identity, for these are the foundations of who a person is. In addition, a person’s beliefs also contribute to internal and external identity. For example, some believe women who have freely chosen to wear the Islamic headscarf or full-face veil are expressing their religious beliefs and personal identity. This has led to much debate and controversy within states which have banned the wearing of full-face veils in public.\n\nAs of 2011, both Belgium and France have banned the full-face Islamic veil in public places. The ban occurred under the administration of President Sarkozy, who stated that veils oppressed women and were \"not welcome\" in France. But Marshall highlights that the ban is disproportionate and it is not government's place to determine what women should wear especially when it misrecognises her and disrespects her identity and personality. While France explains that the intentions of the ban were to promote public order and secularism, \"Arslan v Turkey\" held that Article 9 had been violated and that France has failed to recognise the intrinsic worth of women who freely choose to wear such veils. As illustrated under Article 1 of the Declaration of Human Rights, all beings are born equal and therefore have equal worth. Finally, Amnesty International has repeatedly urged France not to impose the ban, saying it violates European human rights law.\n\nThe issue of the full-face veil ban in France and Belgium illustrates the extent of legal protection an individual has on their personal identity. Being empowered to make self-determined choices, such as freely choosing to wear a full-face veil to illustrate beliefs, Marshall believes, is an interpreted concept of human dignity and human freedom, allowing each woman's identity to be legally recognised. The enjoyment of these rights and freedoms in the ECHR are protected under Article 14, and \"shall be secured without discrimination regardless of sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.\"\n\nHowever, these are the opinions of only some scholars. This is a contested issue and others believe that the banning of full-face veils is about liberating females to express their sexuality and providing them the opportunity to show the world who they truly are. These aspects also promote and encourage personal identity.\n\nThe right to have and develop a personality is addressed in Article 22 of the UDHR: \"Everyone is entitled to the realisation of the rights needed for one’s dignity and the free development of their personality.\" Article 29 also protects the right to develop one’s personality: \"[e]veryone has duties to the community in which alone the free and full development of his personality is possible.\" Manuc explains that personality rights can be defined as those expressing the quintessence of the human person, and are intrinsic to being human. These rights recognise the \"spirit\" within an individual and have developed from the issues of privacy. Personality rights emerged from the German legal system in the late twentieth century to seek distance from the horrors of Naziism. It was also a mechanism to improve tort law surrounding privacy, as illustrated in the \"Criminal Diary\" case.\n\nThe case concerned the issue of personality structure and having the right to determine oneself. Ederle explained this as a right individuals have to choose how to be related in the world. Through the help of the German Constitutional Court, an individual can actively seek and create an intimate sphere so his personality can develop and be protected. Some states see no need for a specific law to personality, as their system of law possesses a different foundation for personality protection. For example, France, South Africa and England have an all-embracing law that protects an individual’s interest concerning physical integrity, feelings, dignity and privacy and identity. However, in addition to substantial protection to personality through privacy, the Netherlands and Austria also recognise a general right to personality.\n\nThe UN Convention on the Rights of the Child stresses the value and importance of a child’s identity. Giroux and De Lorenzi separate the understanding of identity into two parts: static and dynamic. The static aspects of identity concern attributes that make one visible to the outside world, for example, physical features, sex, name, genetics, and nationality. Dynamic aspects include morals and religious and cultural characteristics. Under Article 7, a child has a right to have a \"legal\" identity by being registered, and has a right to a name and a nationality. These protect mainly the static aspects of identity. However, Article 8 protects and encourages the child’s dynamic aspects of identity through preserving his or her identity in relation to nationality, name and family relations. Article 8 illustrates the state’s duty to protect this right, both passively and actively.\n\nArticles 7 and 8 developed to confront the issues of children in political struggles and disappearances. For example, \"Gelman v Urugnay\" concerned the kidnapping of Maria Gelman which prevented her from developing relationships with her parents and concealing her true identity from her. 193 states have ratified the convention, making it the most-ratified convention in history, including all United Nation members except the United States, Somalia and South Sudan.\n\nIdentity is also within people's genes as evidenced by debates concerning anonymity for gamete donation. Since 2005, in the UK, donor-received people can contact their donor once over 18 to find out where they have come from and prevent genealogical bewilderment. However, there are global differences towards the debate; for example, in Canada and the United States there are no regulations, whereas in Switzerland the donor must be willing to be identified, and in France, anonymity is forced.\n\nThere are some scholars who believe the right to identity must be treated with caution. Rosemary Coombe expressed her concerns of personal identity becoming property as there is the belief that through marginalising identity, it could be accepted as private and exclusive property. Lionel Bently is also concerned with this idea and highlights his worry through a quote from the \"Du Boulay\" case: \"Property rights in 'identity'… have the potential to curtail the liberties of those who wish to build their own identities, in whatever way, and for whatever reason.\" Other scholars believe that enshrining personal identity into the law is restricting people's choices and flexibility to transform and change who they are. However, human rights can also perform the contrary and protect individuals' choices on personal identity. While developing personal identity comes down to the individual to manifest character and work out 'who they are,' Marshall highlights that jurisprudence has evolved to create a positive obligation on states to provide social conditions such as private and personality rights to be respected, demonstrating that the international audience acknowledges that legal recognition is necessary to allow individuals to choose how they want to live and who they are.\n\n"}

{"id": "23375124", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23375124", "title": "Sherman Antitrust Act (federal preemption)", "text": "Sherman Antitrust Act (federal preemption)\n\nTo determine whether the Sherman Antitrust Act preempts a state law, courts will engage in a two-step analysis, as set forth by the Supreme Court in Rice v. Norman Williams Co..\n\nThe antitrust laws allow coincident state regulation of competition. The Supreme Court enunciated the test for determining when a state statute is in irreconcilable conflict with Section 1 of the Sherman Act in Rice v. Norman Williams Co.. Different standards apply depending on whether a statute is attacked on its face or for its effects.\n\nRice sets out guidelines to aid in preemption analysis. Preemption should not occur \"simply because in a hypothetical situation a private party's compliance with the statute might cause him to violate the antitrust laws.\" This language suggests that preemption occurs only if economic analysis determines that the statutory requirements create \"an unacceptable and unnecessary risk of anticompetitive effect,\" and does not occur simply because it is possible to use the statute in an anticompetitive manner. It should not mean that preemption is impossible whenever both procompetitive and anticompetitive results are conceivable. The per se rule \"reflects the judgment that such cases are not sufficiently common or important to justify the time and expense necessary to identify them.\"\n\nAnother important, yet, in the context of Rice, ambiguous guideline regarding preemption by Section 1 is the Court's statement that a \"state statute is not preempted by the federal antitrust laws simply because the state scheme might have an anticompetitive effect.\" The meaning of this statement is clarified by examining the three cases cited in Rice to support the statement.\n\nRice v. Norman Williams Co. supports this misuse limitation on preemption. Rice states that while particular conduct or arrangements by private parties would be subject to per se or rule of reason analysis to determine liability, \"[t]here is no basis . . . for condemning the statute itself by force of the Sherman Act.\"\n\nThus, when a state requires conduct analyzed under the rule of reason, a court must carefully distinguish rule of reason analysis for preemption purposes from the analysis for liability purposes. To analyze whether preemption occurs, the court must determine whether the inevitable effects of a statutory restraint unreasonably restrain trade. If they do, preemption is warranted unless the statute passes the appropriate state action tests. But, when the statutory conduct combines with other practices in a larger conspiracy to restrain trade, or when the statute is used to violate the antitrust laws in a market in which such a use is not compelled by the state statute, the private party might be subjected to antitrust liability without preemption of the statute.\n\nThe Act was not intended to regulate existing state statutes regulating commerce within state borders. The House committee, in reporting the bill which was adopted without change, declared:\nNo attempt is made to invade the legislative authority of the several States or even to occupy doubtful grounds. No system of laws can be devised by Congress alone which would effectually protect the people of the [322 U.S. 533, 575] United States against the evils and oppression of trusts and monopolies. Congress has no authority to deal, generally, with the subject within the States, and the States have no authority to legislate in respect of commerce between the several States or with foreign nations.\n\nSee also the statement on the floor of the House by Mr. Culberson, in charge of the bill,\nThere is no attempt to exercise any doubtful authority on this subject, but the bill is confined strictly and alone to subjects over which, confessedly, there is no question about the legislative power of Congress. ... \n\nAnd see the statement of Senator Edmunds, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee which reported out the bill in the form in which it passed, that in drafting that bill the committee thought that \"we would frame a bill that should be clearly within our constitutional power, that we would make its definition out of terms that were well known to the law already, and would leave it to the courts in the first instance to say how far they could carry it or its particular definitions as applicable to each particular case as the occasion might arise.\" \n\nSimilarly Senator Hoar, a member of that committee who with Senator Edmunds was in charge of the bill, stated\nNow we are dealing with an offense against interstate or international commerce, which the State cannot regulate by penal enactment, and we find the United States without any common law. The great thing that this bill does, except affording a remedy, is to extend the common-law principles, which protected fair competition in trade in old times in England, to international and interstate commerce in the United States.\n"}
{"id": "29260994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29260994", "title": "Sound trademark", "text": "Sound trademark\n\nA sound trademark is a trademark where sound is used to perform the trademark function of uniquely identifying the commercial origin of products or services.\n\nIn recent times, sounds have been increasingly used as trademarks in the marketplace. However, it has traditionally been difficult to protect sounds as trademarks through registration, as a sound was not considered to be a 'trademark'. This issue was addressed by the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, which broadened the legal definition of trademark to encompass \"any sign...capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertaking\" (article 15(1)).\n\nDespite the recognition which must be accorded to sound trademarks in most countries, the \"graphical representation\" of such marks sometimes constitutes a problem for trademark owners seeking to protect their marks, and different countries have different methods for dealing with this issue.\n\n\"Sound branding\" (also known as \"audio branding\", \"music branding\", \"sonic branding\", \"acoustic branding\") is “the strategic use of sound … in positively differentiating a product or service, enhancing recall, creating preference, building trust, and even increasing sales.” Audio branding can tell you whether the brand is romantic and sensual, family-friendly and everyday, indulgent and luxurious, without ever hearing a word or seeing a picture. And it gives a brand an additional way to break through audiences’ shortened attention spans. \n\nThe sound logo (or audio mnemonic) is one of the tools of sound branding, along with the jingle, brand music, and brand theme. A sound logo (or audio logo or sonic logo) is a short distinctive melody or other sequence of sound, mostly positioned at the beginning or ending of a commercial. It can be seen as the acoustic equivalent of a visual logo. Often a combination of both types of logo is used to enforce the recognition of a brand. An example is the T-Mobile logo and ringtone composed by Lance Massey, the Intel logo composed by Walter Werzowa, or the Michelin logo composed by Sixième Son. \n\nThe sound logo leads to learning effects on consumer's perception of a certain product. A melody is the most memorable sequence of sound, since, when a melody starts, the human brain automatically expects the ending. However, some brands realize the importance the sound their brand can make and attempt to capitalize on its own uniqueness. A good example is the motorcycle brand Harley-Davidson, which, in 1994, filed a sound trademark application for its distinctive V-twin engine sound. It realized that if it could capture its own sound, it could distinguish the brand at every point of customer interaction. Just like a visual logo, the most essential qualities of a sound logo are uniqueness, memorability, and relevancy to the brand promise.\n\nSome widely known examples include:\n\n\nRadio and television stations create their own audio identities using melodic themes to strengthen their brand. Notable examples include the short variations of the BBC Radio 2 or Classic FM jingles. In recent years, television station idents have also introduced their own audio identities to strengthen their brand recognitions.\n\nThere are typically fours to six steps involved in creating a sound logo: \n\n\nOnce completed, the audio elements should be managed just like the rest of a company’s brand assets.\n\nCreating a brand experience using sound is also within the area of sound branding. The opportunities for creating a sound branding experience that conveys a brand essence and soul is possible. Bentley Motors, for instance, recently looked to create a unique brand experience by replacing all interior mechanical sounds with sound that had been created for their Continental GT car. Roland Garros, home of the French Open created an audio identity that is used in its facilities and played during award ceremonies as well as opening and closing ceremonies. \n\nIn a retail environments, sound branding extends to the use of sound in order to enhance the consumer experience and influence behavior . “For instance, an academic study that took place in a Scotland supermarket found that sales of wines displayed side-by-side and priced similarly responded to music. On days when French music played, French wines outsold German wines. German wines, however, outsold French ones on days when typical German music was playing.\n\nBritish department store chain Selfridges is one of the notable brands to have enjoyed success with this approach, creating distinct consumer ‘zones’ within its stores, which change visually and sonically so customers know they have passed into a new department. These zones are often tailored to suit a particular product, customer profile, season or even times of the day and week. The Swedish Mall, Emporia, has also found success using soundscapes to help guide customers. Unibail Rodamco upscale malls have an audio identity that is adapted to their parking lots, entryways, walkways, even chairs and plant walls and extends into their advertising.\n\nSound design for mobile phones, ATMs, laptop computers, PDAs, and countless other devices can improve the user experience by making tasks easier and more enjoyable. These sounds can also reveal something about the company that created the experience (and, in the case of personalized ringtones, something about the user him/herself). \n\nSound branding also encompasses the use of targeted audio messages by organizations to communicate with customers over the telephone, known as on-hold marketing or on-hold messaging. These messages are typically deployed on an organizations interactive voice response (IVR) switchboard system or when customers are placed on hold and incorporate short, informative voice messages often accompanied by music.\n\nA study commissioned by audio branding specialist PHMG provided insight into consumer perceptions of on-hold marketing. It revealed 70% of consumers are put on hold for more than 50% of their calls and 68% of consumers are put on hold for longer than one minute. When on hold, 73% of callers want to hear something other than beeps or silence and 76% preferred to hear something other than muzak.\n\nSound branding encompasses many other tactics intended to convey organizational or product identity (who an organization is and what it stands for); enhance consumers' experience of a product or service; or extend an organization's relationship with its audience.\nAnother form of sound branding involves an organization's public association with or sponsorship of a musical enterprise—a non-profit music organization, for instance, or perhaps a music artist or group of artists. For example, some companies completely unrelated to music offer free music downloads on their websites. Ostensibly intended to demonstrate the sponsoring organization's good will from a cultural patronage stand point, practices like these also brand the organization by calling public attention to its beliefs, its values, and its aesthetic sensibilities. \n\nIt's arguable that sound branding is now using ‘subliminal’ brand placement in pop song lyrics to echo a corporate slogan, a company’s ‘Unique Selling Point’ or ‘brand values’ (rather than the ‘old fashioned’ mentioning of brands / products directly). An example of this would be Pharrell Williams’ 2005 song ‘Can I Have It Like That’ (featuring Gwen Stefani), with the chorus which echoed the Burger King advertising slogan \"Have It Your Way”. \n\nAudio marketing, also known as on-hold marketing or on-hold messaging, is increasingly being seen as an important element of audio branding. It involves the creation of brand-congruent voice and music tracks, which are used by companies to communicate marketing messages to customers over the telephone. Typically, these messages are played while a customer is waiting on hold or while they are being transferred. They are also frequently used as part of interactive voice response systems designed to handle large volumes of calls.\n\nDifferent attributes of voice and music, including tempo, tone, pitch and volume, are all taken into account in order to create messaging that reinforce the values conveyed through a company's visual branding.\n\nChanges in consumer perceptions towards audio marketing have played a large part in its adoption. Negative perceptions were traditionally attached to on-hold marketing but a more recent survey conducted by CNN found that 70% of callers in the United States who are made to hold the line in silence will hang up within 60 seconds, while further research by PHMG found 73% of consumers want to hear something more than beeps or silence on hold.\n\n“Sixième Son’s work for SNCF indicate that an audio brand can become a significant asset for a company. With SNCF, for instance, they found that 92% of listeners can correctly identify the audio brand in testing — “and that 88% of these listeners correctly identified the brand upon hearing just two notes. And perhaps more significantly, 71% of them now see the brand as being ‘attractive’ or ‘very attractive,’ and SNCF has experienced an 18% increase in the perception of leadership.” \n\nIn Australia, sound trademarks are generally acceptable if they can be represented by musical notation. According to the Australian trademarks Office, an application for a sound trademark which cannot be graphically represented with musical notation must include the following requirements.\n\n\nOther requirements are set out in the \"trademarks Office Manual of Practice and Procedure\" issued by IP Australia.\n\nIn the European Union, Article 4 of \"Council Regulation (EC) No. 40-94\" of 20 December 1993 (\"signs of which a Community trademark may consist\") relevantly states that any CTM may consist of \"any signs capable of being represented graphically...provided that such signs are capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings\". In Shield Mark BV vs Joost Kist (case C-283/01) the EcJ basically repeats the criteria from Sieckmann v German Patent Office (case C-273/00) that graphical representation, preferably means by images, lines or characters, and that the representation must be clear, precise, self-contained, easily accessible, intelligible, durable and objective.\n\nThis definition generally encompasses sound marks, and therefore an applicant for a CTM may use musical notation to graphically represent their trademark. A piece of music—a tune, or a ring tone on a telephone—can be easily registered as a trademark (provided, of course, that it meets the Community trademark tests for registrability and distinctiveness). While tunes are capable of registration, before 2005 noises were not. The sound of a dog barking or the crash of surf cannot be recorded in musical notation and sonagrams were not accepted by the OHIM trademark registry. A change in legislation occurred in 2005 so that now the Office accepts sonograms as a graphical representation of a trademark if they are accompanied by an MP3 sound file when filing a trademark electronically.\n\nIn the United States, the test for whether a sound can serve as a trademark \"depends on [the] aural perception of the listener which may be as fleeting as the sound itself unless, of course, the sound is so inherently different or distinctive that it attaches to the subliminal mind of the listener to be awakened when heard and to be associated with the source or event with which it struck\".\n\nThis was the fairly strict test applied by the US Trademark Trial and Appeal Board in the case of General Electric Broadcasting Co., 199 USPQ 560, in relation to the timed toll of a ship's bell clock.\n\nMore famously, Harley-Davidson attempted to register as a trademark the distinctive \"chug\" of a Harley-Davidson motorcycle engine. On February 1, 1994, the company filed its application with the following description: \"The mark consists of the exhaust sound of applicant's motorcycles, produced by V-twin, common crankpin motorcycle engines when the goods are in use.\" Nine of Harley-Davidson's competitors filed oppositions against the application, arguing that cruiser-style motorcycles of various brands use the same crankpin V-twin engine which produces the same sound. After six years of litigation, with no end in sight, in early 2000, Harley-Davidson withdrew their application.\n\nOther companies have been more successful in registering their distinctive sounds: MGM and their lion's roar; the NBC chimes; famous basketball team the Harlem Globetrotters and their theme song \"Sweet Georgia Brown\"; Intel and the three-second chord sequence used with the Pentium processor; THX and its \"Deep Note\"; Federal Signal Corporation and the sound of their \"Q2B\" fire truck siren; AT&T and the spoken letters \"AT&T\" accompanied by music; RKO with a combined moving image and sound mark depicting the RKO Pictures radio tower transmitting a Morse-code like signal; and 20th Century Fox with the very famous fanfare composed by Alfred Newman.\n\n\n\n"}

In the United Kingdom and Europe, this type of status offense may be termed a regulatory offense.\n\nDefinitions of status offense vary. A neutral definition may be \"[a] type of crime that is not based upon prohibited action or inaction but rests on the fact that the offender has a certain personal condition or is of a specified character.\" The Federal Sentencing Guidelines states that a juvenile status offense is a crime which cannot be committed by an adult. For example, possession of a firearm \"by a minor\", by definition, cannot be done by an adult. In some states the term \"status offense\" does not apply to adults at all; according to Wyoming law, status offenses can be committed only by people under 18 years of age.\n\nJuvenile status offenders are distinguished from juvenile delinquent offenders in that status offenders have not committed an act that would be considered a crime if it were committed by an adult, whereas delinquent youths have committed such an act.\n\nHowever, some sexting laws and broadly interpreted child pornography laws have effectively made sexting by a minor into a status offense, but it is treated by the legal system as a criminal offense, punishable by long prison terms and large fines. It is de facto a status offense since an adult is allowed to possess a nude image of themselves but a minor is not allowed to possess or distribute a nude image of themselves.\n\nStatus offenses may include consumption of alcohol, truancy, and running away from home. These acts may be illegal for persons under a certain age, while remaining legal for all others, which makes them status offenses.\n\nStatus offense may also apply to other classes, including laws forbidding ownership of firearms by felons, where such ownership is otherwise legal.\n\nLaws that prohibit certain actions to certain persons based on their sex, race, nationality, religion, etc., are also status offenses. A law that prohibits men from using public toilets intended for women, as well as a law that sets a curfew for people below a certain age, are examples of status offenses.\n\nStatus offenses from the past that are no longer operative include:\n\n"}

For example, a straw donor may contribute to a political campaign before being reimbursed by another, who is using that person as a conduit to exceed the limits on campaign contributions under the laws of a jurisdiction.\n\nIn federal elections in the United States, straw donor schemes are illegal under 52 U.S.C. § 30122, which states:\nNo person shall make a contribution in the name of another person or knowingly permit his name to be used to effect such a contribution, and no person shall knowingly accept a contribution made by one person in the name of another person.\nThis section was enacted as part of the Federal Election Campaign Act in 1971.\n\nA Massachusetts law firm, Thornton Law, has been accused of funneling funds to the Democrats through a massive and illegal straw-donor scheme.\n\nLaw firm partners donated nearly $1.6 million to mostly Democratic candidates and committees between 2010 through 2014.

The act repealed the Royal Marriages Act 1772, replacing male-preference primogeniture with absolute primogeniture for those born in the line of succession after 28 October 2011, which meant the eldest child, regardless of sex, would precede his or her brothers and sisters. The act also ended the historical disqualification of a person who married a Roman Catholic from the line of succession, and removed the requirement of those outside the first six persons in line to the throne to seek the Sovereign's approval to marry. It came into force on 26 March 2015, at the same time as the other Commonwealth realms implemented the Perth Agreement in their own laws.\n\nUnder the Act of Settlement 1701 the throne of the Kingdom of England was settled on the Electress Sophia of Hanover and the \"heirs of her body\", this phrase being understood under English common law to imply male-preference primogeniture, meaning that brothers would precede sisters in the line of succession. The Act also prevented a \"papist\" (Roman Catholic) from inheriting the English throne and removed those who had married Roman Catholics from the line of succession.\n\nThe treaties that created the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707 and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801 specifically applied these provisions to the new British throne. Article II of the Acts of Union 1707 stated that the \"Succession of the Monarchy\" is settled by the Act of Settlement 1701, and the ban of \"Papists\" from inheriting the throne was to continue according to that Act. Article 2 of Acts of Union 1801, again maintained that the succession rules in place in the new United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland should be \"continued limited and settled in the same manner\".\n\nSince the Acts of Union 1707, male preference primogeniture has operated twice to displace a female by a younger brother: when Princess Augusta's younger brother became King George III on the death of their grandfather King George II (1760); and when Princess Victoria's younger brother became King Edward VII on the death of their mother Queen Victoria (1901).\n\nPrincess Anne is the younger sister of the heir apparent, Prince Charles. Her place in the line of succession is not affected by the provisions of the Act relating to male preference, in that she remains head of the line following those headed by her younger brothers, whose lines continue to precede hers under male preference.\n\nIn December 2011 the Statement of Friday 28 October 2011 issued at Perth was published in a House of Commons committee report. It stated that the prime ministers of the sixteen Commonwealth nations \"of whom Her Majesty the Queen is Head of State\" had \"agreed in principle to work together towards a common approach to amending the rules on the succession to their respective Crowns\", and that they would wish \"unanimously to advise The Queen of their views and seek her agreement.\" The statement continued:\n\nIn a letter to the other realms' heads of government, prior to the Perth Agreement, British Prime Minister David Cameron had additionally proposed to limit the requirement to obtain the monarch's permission to marry to the first six people in line to the throne.\n\nOn 4 December 2012, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg announced:\nThe bill was published on 13 December 2012, and after passing both Houses of Parliament it received royal assent on 25 April 2013, immediately before the prorogation of Parliament that day. \n\nThe purpose of the Succession to the Crown Act is to give effect in the United Kingdom to the Perth agreement. The British government announced that the Act's provisions were not intended to come into force before the appropriate domestic arrangements were in place in the other Commonwealth realms.\n\nMales born after 28 October 2011 no longer precede their elder sisters in the line of succession. The first people in the line of succession to be affected by the changes on the date they came into force were the children of Lady Davina Lewis, her son Tāne (born 2012) and her daughter Senna (born 2010), who were reversed in the order of succession, becoming 29th and 28th in line respectively.\n\nWhen the Act came into force, the Duchess of Cambridge was expecting Princess Charlotte, upon whom the Act had no immediate practical effect; from her birth on 2 May 2015 she was fourth in line to the Throne, after Prince George of Cambridge and ahead of Prince Harry, just as she would have been had the Act not been passed. However, due to the provisions of the Act, she has retained her place in the succession ahead of Prince Louis of Cambridge, her younger brother.\n\nMarrying a Roman Catholic no longer disqualifies a person from succeeding to the Crown. The explanation published when the bill had been introduced mentioned that those who had lost their places in the line of succession by marrying a Roman Catholic would regain their places, but that those \"with a realistic prospect of succeeding to the Throne\" would not be affected. The first person in the new line of succession to be affected by this change when it came into effect was George Windsor, Earl of St Andrews, who had married a Roman Catholic in 1988, and was restored to the line of succession in 34th place, after his father the Duke of Kent. The provision of the Act of Settlement requiring the monarch to be a Protestant continues, as the monarch remains the Supreme Governor of the Church of England.\n\nThe Royal Marriages Act 1772 is repealed. Instead, only the first six persons in line to the throne require the Sovereign's approval to marry. Marriage without the Sovereign's consent would disqualify the person and the person's descendants from the marriage from succeeding to the Crown. However, the marriage would still be legally valid.\n\nMarriages legally void under the Royal Marriages Act 1772 will be treated as never having been void, except for purposes relating to the succession to the Crown, provided all the following conditions are met:\n\nProvisions in the Acts of Union 1707, between England and Scotland, and in the Acts of Union 1800, between Great Britain and Ireland, that involve the Crown are \"subject to provisions of\" the Act, several sections in the Bill of Rights 1689 and the Act of Settlement 1701 involving marriages with \"papists\" (Catholics) were repealed. Any references to provisions relating to \"the succession to, or possession of, the Crown\" also include, by reference, the provisions of this act.\n\nHowever, the sections that ban Catholic succession were not repealed. Catholics are still officially termed as being \"naturally dead and deemed to be dead\" in terms of succession. This distinction was first legislated in the Bill of Rights 1689. Jacob Rees-Mogg (Con) also confirmed \"the Act of Settlement deems somebody who has been a Catholic for a minute to be 'dead' in terms of the succession, and it passes over them 'as if they were dead'. It is an absolute. If at any moment in their whole life they were in communion with Rome, they are excluded from the throne, deemed to be dead.\" Mark Durkan (SDLP) tried to make an incorrect comparison of this with McCarthyism, \"In effect, it is the McCarthyite question: 'Are you now or have you ever been a Catholic?'”. He then went on with a summary of the proviso that was more accurate, “For anybody who has ever been a Catholic in any shape or form, that is it, they are out; they count as dead for these purposes.\" The ban continues, although it is not only a ban on Catholics but on any religion other than Protestant, since the Acts of Union 1707 require the monarch to be a Protestant.\n\nAs the monarch's eldest son will no longer automatically be heir apparent, the Treason Act 1351 was also amended, so that encompassing the death of the monarch's eldest son is now extended to murdering the heir apparent, whatever the sex. Another amendment to the Treason Act is that, whereas it had been treason to \"violate\" the monarch's eldest son's wife, it is now only treason if the eldest son is also the eldest child.\n\nThe Regency Act 1937 was amended to require the regent to be a person who had not been disqualified from the succession by marrying without the monarch's permission under the 2013 Act.\n\nNone of the provisions of the act altering the law, including those which will or may affect any direct or collateral line of succession to the British throne, were to come into force until a day appointed for it by a commencement order made by the Lord President of the Council. When publishing the bill the government had announced that it was expecting to bring the provisions into force at the same time as the other realms would be bringing into force any changes to their legislation or other changes necessary for them to implement the Perth Agreement. This was done on 26 March 2015.\nThe legislation passed in the realms of Australia, Barbados, and Canada make reference to the United Kingdom legislation in different ways. The Succession to the Crown Act 2015, passed by the parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, is expressed to be for changing \"the law relating to the effect of gender and marriage on royal succession, consistently with changes made to that law in the United Kingdom, so that the Sovereign of Australia is the same person as the Sovereign of the United Kingdom\". The Succession to the Throne Act, 2013, passed by the parliament of Canada, refers to the bill (not the act): \"The alteration in the law touching the Succession to the Throne set out in the bill laid before the Parliament of the United Kingdom and entitled A Bill to Make succession to the Crown not depend on gender; to make provision about Royal Marriages; and for connected purposes is assented to.\" The parliament of Barbados' Succession to the Throne Act, 2013, uses similar wording to Canada's law: \"The Parliament of Barbados acquiesces to the alteration in the law relating to the Succession to the Throne set out in the Bill laid before the\nParliament of the United Kingdom and entitled A Bill to make succession to the Crown not depend on gender; to make provision about Royal Marriages; and for connected purposes.\"\n\nOn 6 January 2013, the \"Daily Mail\" reported that the Prince of Wales had \"serious concerns\" about the proposed legislation:\n\nA spokesman for the Cabinet Office and a spokesman for the Prince declined to comment on the \"Daily Mail\" report. On 9 January 2013, Prime Minister David Cameron said in regard to the proposals that \"there has been very thorough contact between No. 10 Downing Street and the palace, and all the issues are settled and agreed\".\n\nOn 21 January 2013, the Church of England published a briefing endorsing the bill's provisions and stating, \"The use of fast-tracking procedures [for the bill] is acceptable.\" The same day, the \"Telegraph\" reported that the Church of England had written to MPs to express its official backing for the proposed changes.\n\nA report on the rules of royal succession was prepared by the Political and Constitutional Reform Select Committee of the House of Commons, chaired by Graham Allen, and was published in December 2011. The report welcomed the proposals, but drew attention to \"connected issues that may be raised when the proposals are debated, depending on the scope of the bill, especially the future role of the Crown in the Church of England, and the continued ineligibility of women to succeed to the majority of hereditary peerages, which remains a matter of public interest for as long as it has an impact on gender balance in the House of Lords\".\n\nOn 9 September 2012, the British government published a response to the report, reiterating that it intended to implement the Perth Agreement but had no plans to change the laws of succession to peerages or the established status of the Church of England.\n\nOn 21 January 2013, the House of Lords Constitution Committee published a report opposing the Government's plan to fast-track the bill, citing the legislation's \"constitutional significance\" and \"possible unintended consequences\".\n\nIn response, the Government expanded the time allocated for the bill's debate in the House of Commons from one day to two days, and it decided not to fast-track the bill in the House of Lords, where the normal time limits were observed.\n\nThe first reading (introduction) of the bill in the House of Commons took place on 13 December 2012. Passage of an Allocation of Time motion, the second reading, and the committee stage (in the form of a Committee of the Whole House) took place on 22 January 2013. The report stage and third reading (passage) took place on 28 January 2013. The only amendment made in the House of Commons was to insert the words \"from the marriage\" after the word \"descendants\" in section 3(3), which was passed without debate.\n\nThe first reading of the bill in the House of Lords took place on 29 January 2013. The bill passed second reading on 14 February 2013 and was reviewed by committee on 28 February 2013. The report stage was on 13 March 2013. The bill was passed at the third reading on 22 April. No amendments were made to the bill in the House of Lords, and it received the Royal Assent on 25 April 2013.\n\nConsents for marriages under the Act appear in the Privy Council Orders. The first person in line of succession to receive consent under the new law is Prince Harry. \n\n"}

Often, the series of cases is referred to as the “antibiotics litigation.”\n\nThe focal point of the case was the two companies’ settlement of an interference proceeding before the PTO (the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office) over the priority of their respective applications for tetracycline. Under the settlement, American Cyanamid, which had acquired Heyden Chemicals‘s pending tetracycline application, conceded the priority of Pfizer’s application, withdrew its own application and exchanged cross licenses with Pfizer. According to the indictment of American Cyanamid, Bristol Myers, Pfizer, and Cyanamid knew that tetracycline represented a threat to the continuation of their dominant positions and unreasonably high profits. To keep that threat in check, the indictment alleges, Cyanamid bought out Heyden's rights to the development and agreed to help Pfizer get the tetracycline patent. In return, charges the Justice Department. Pfizer licensed Cyanamid to produce the drug. Later, to avoid a court fight that might have nullified the patent, Pfizer and Cyanamid let Bristol-Myers in. \n\nThe Federal Trade Commission found that the cross-license, combined with the fact that Pfizer had withheld information that it knew or should have known was relevant to the patentability of tetracycline, constituted an attempt by Pfizer and American Cyanamid to share in an unlawful monopoly.

It had no revenue, but was initially valued at $1 billion on account of it highly desirable customer base (social media fanatics, smart phone users) and its attractive industry niche (smart phone space).\n\nSeveral other high-profile tech companies have had a valuation based on MPM including: Google's purchase of Snapseed and Money Supermarket's purchase of MoneySavingExpert.com ($120million).\n"}

The earliest known use of a vehicle-ramming attack took place in 1973 in Prague, former Czechoslovakia, when Olga Hepnarová killed 8 people. According to Stratfor Global Intelligence analysts, this attack represented a new militant tactic which is less lethal but could prove more difficult to prevent than suicide bombings.\n\nDeliberate vehicle-ramming into crowd of people is a tactic used by terrorists, becoming a major terrorist tactic in the 2010s because it requires little skill to perpetrate and has the potential to cause significant casualties. Deliberate vehicle-ramming has also been carried out in the course of other types of crimes, including road rage incidents. Deliberate vehicle-ramming incidents have also sometimes been ascribed to the driver's psychiatric disorder.\n\nVehicles have also been used by attackers to breach buildings with locked gates, before detonating explosives, as in the Saint-Quentin-Fallavier attack.\n\nAccording to the American Federal Bureau of Investigation, the tactic has gained popularity because \"Vehicle ramming offers terrorists with limited access to explosives or weapons an opportunity to conduct a homeland attack with minimal prior training or experience.\" Counterterrorism researcher Daveed Gartenstein-Ross of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies told \"Slate\" that the tactic has been on the rise in Israel because, \"the security barrier is fairly effective, which makes it hard to get bombs into the country.\" In 2010, \"Inspire\", the online, English-language magazine produced by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula urged mujahideen to choose \"pedestrian only\" locations and make sure to gain speed before ramming their vehicles into the crowd in order to \"achieve maximum carnage\".\n\nVehicle attacks can be carried out by lone-wolf terrorists who are inspired by an ideology, but who are not actually working within a specific political movement or group. Writing for \"The Daily Beast\", Jacob Siegel suggests that the perpetrator of the 2014 Couture-Rouleau attack may be \"the kind of terrorist the West could be seeing a lot more of in the future\", a kind that he describes, following Brian Jenkins of the Rand Corporation, as \"stray dogs\", rather than lone wolves, characterizing them as \"misfits\" who are \"moved from seething anger to spontaneous deadly action\" by exposure to Islamist propaganda. A 2014 propaganda video by ISIL encouraged French sympathizers to use cars to run down civilians.\n\nAccording to Clint Watts, of the Foreign Policy Research Institute, where he is a senior fellow and expert on terrorism, the older model where members of groups like al-Qaeda would \"plan and train together before going to carry out an attack, became defunct around 2005\", due to increased surveillance by Western security agencies. Watts says that Anwar al-Awlaki, the American born al-Qaeda imam, as a key figure in this shift, addressing English-speakers in their own language and urging them to \"Do your own terrorism and stay in place.\"\n\nJamie Bartlett, who heads the Violence and Extremism Program at Demos, a British think tank, explains that \"the internet in the last few years has both increased the possibilities and the likelihood of lone-wolf terrorism,\" supplying isolated individuals with ideological motivation and technique. For authorities in Western countries, the difficulty is that even in a case like that of the perpetrator of the 2014 Couture-Rouleau attack, where Canadian police had identified the attacker, taken away his passport, and were working with his family and community to steer him away from jihad, vehicle attacks can be hard to prevent because, \"it's very difficult to know exactly what an individual is planning to do before a crime is committed. We cannot arrest someone for thinking radical thoughts; it's not a crime in Canada.\"\n\nAccording to Stratfor, the American global intelligence firm, \"while not thus far as deadly as suicide bombing\", this tactic could prove more difficult to prevent. No single group has claimed responsibility for the incidents. Experts see a sort of saving grace in the ignorance and incompetence of most lone wolf terrorists, who often manage to murder very few people.\n\nVehicular ramming has sometimes been advocated as a means to deal with protesters who block public roadways in the United States. Two police officers were suspended and fired in January and June 2016, respectively, for tweeting such advice in relation to Black Lives Matter rallies, which have sometimes been broken up by cars. North Dakota state legislator Keith Kempenich tried and failed to pass a law granting civil immunity to drivers who accidentally hit activists, after his mother-in-law was stopped by Dakota Access Pipeline protesters, and Tennessee Senator Bill Ketron did likewise after a man hit an anti-Trump group. Similar legislation has been introduced in Florida and Texas. After the white supremacist Unite the Right rally, in which a anti-fascist protestor was killed in a vehicle ramming attack, conservative media outlets Fox News and The Daily Caller deleted videos which encouraged driving through crowds of protestors.\n\nOn 23 October 2014, the US National Institute of Building Sciences updated its Building Design Guideline on \"Crash- and Attack-Resistant Models\" of bollards, a guideline written to help professionals design bollards to protect facilities from vehicle operators, \"who plan or carry out acts of property destruction, incite terrorism, or cause the deaths of civilian, industrial or military populations\". The American Bar Association recommends bollards as effective protection against car ramming attacks.\n\nSecurity bollards are credited with minimizing damage and casualties in the 2007 Glasgow Airport attack, and with preventing ramming in the 2014 Alon Shvut stabbing attack, leading the assailant to abandon his car and attack pedestrians waiting at a bus stop with a knife, after his effort to run them over was thwarted. However, Berlin's police chief, Klaus Kandt, argued that bollards would not have prevented the 2016 Berlin attack, and that the required security measures would be \"varied, complex, and far from a panacea\".\n\nThe city of Münster has been planning to install security bollards in public areas in response to vehicle-ramming attacks in European cities, including the 2016 Berlin attack. While only selected locations can be protected this way, tight bends and restricted-width streets may also prevent a large vehicle getting speed before reaching a barrier.\n\nModern Internet-connected drive-by-wire cars can potentially be hacked remotely and used for such attacks. In 2015, hackers remotely carjacked a Jeep from 10 miles away and drove it into a ditch. Measures for cybersecurity of automobiles to prevent such are often criticized as to being insufficient.\n\nIn chronological order:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
