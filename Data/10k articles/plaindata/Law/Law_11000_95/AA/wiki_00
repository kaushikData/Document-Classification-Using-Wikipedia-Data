While a boulder may be small enough to move or roll manually, others are extremely massive. \nIn common usage, a boulder is too large for a person to move.

{"id": "965259", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=965259", "title": "Cable modem termination system", "text": "Cable modem termination system\n\nA cable modem termination system or CMTS is a piece of equipment, typically located in a cable company's headend or hubsite, which is used to provide high speed data services, such as cable Internet or Voice over Internet Protocol, to cable subscribers. A CMTS provides many of the same functions provided by the DSLAM in a DSL system.\n\nIn order to provide high speed data services, a cable company will connect its headend to the Internet via very high capacity data links to a network service provider. On the subscriber side of the headend, the CMTS enables the communication with subscribers' cable modems. Different CMTSs are capable of serving different cable modem population sizes—ranging from 4,000 cable modems to 150,000 or more, depending in part on traffic. A given headend may have between 1-12 CMTSs to service the cable modem population served by that headend or HFC hub.\n\nOne way to think of a CMTS is to imagine a router with Ethernet interfaces (connections) on one side and coaxial cable RF interfaces on the other side. The RF/coax interfaces carry RF signals to and from the subscriber's cable modem.\n\nIn fact, most CMTSs have both Ethernet interfaces (or other more traditional high-speed data interfaces like SONET) as well as RF interfaces. In this way, traffic that is coming from the Internet can be routed (or bridged) through the Ethernet interface, through the CMTS and then onto the RF interfaces that are connected to the cable company's hybrid fiber coax (HFC). The traffic winds its way through the HFC to end up at the cable modem in the subscriber's home. Traffic from a subscriber's home system goes through the cable modem and out to the Internet in the opposite direction.\n\nCMTSs typically carry only IP traffic. Traffic destined for the cable modem from the Internet, known as downstream traffic, is carried in IP packets encapsulated according to DOCSIS standard. These packets are carried on data streams that are typically modulated onto a TV channel using either 64-QAM or 256-QAM versions of quadrature amplitude modulation.\n\nUpstream data (data from cable modems to the headend or Internet) is carried in Ethernet frames encapsulated inside DOCSIS frames modulated with QPSK, 16-QAM, 32-QAM, 64-QAM or 128-QAM using TDMA, ATDMA or S-CDMA frequency sharing mechanisms. This is done at the \"subband\" or \"return\" portion of the cable TV spectrum (also known as the \"T\" channels), a much lower part of the frequency spectrum than the downstream signal, usually 5 - 42 MHz in DOCSIS 2.0 or 5 - 60 MHz in EuroDOCSIS.\n\nA typical CMTS allows a subscriber's computer to obtain an IP address by forwarding DHCP requests to the relevant servers. This DHCP server returns, for the most part, what looks like a typical response including an assigned IP address for the computer, gateway/router addresses to use, DNS servers, etc.\n\nThe CMTS may also implement some basic filtering to protect against unauthorized users and various attacks. Traffic shaping is sometimes performed to prioritize application traffic, perhaps based upon subscribed plan or download usage and also to provide guaranteed Quality of service (QoS) for the cable operator's own PacketCable-based VOIP service. However, the function of traffic shaping is more likely done by a Cable Modem or policy traffic switch. A CMTS may also act as a bridge or router.\n\nA customer's cable modem cannot communicate directly with other modems on the line. In general, cable modem traffic is routed to other cable modems or to the Internet through a series of CMTSs and traditional routers. However, a route could conceivably pass through a single CMTS.\n\nA CMTS can be broken down into two different architectures, Integrated CMTS (I-CMTS) or Modular (M-CMTS). There are both pros and cons to each type of architecture.\n\nThe I-CMTS architecture consists of all components housed in a single chassis. The RF interface and IP Networking components are all integrated in a single device. This makes for much simpler RF combining in the headend. The benefits of an all-in-one solution are less single points of failure, lower costs and ease of deployment.\n\nIn an M-CMTS solution the architecture is broken up into two components. The first part is the Physical Downstream component (PHY) which is known as the Edge QAM (EQAM). The second part is the IP networking and DOCSIS MAC Component which is referred to as the M-CMTS Core. There are also several new protocols and components introduced with this type of architecture. One is the DOCSIS Timing Interface, which provides a reference frequency between the EQAM and M-CMTS Core via a DTI Server. The second is the Downstream External PHY Interface (DEPI). The DEPI protocol controls the delivery of DOCSIS\nframes from the M-CMTS Core to the EQAM devices Some of the challenges that entail an M-CMTS platform are increased complexity in RF combining and an increase in the number of failure points. One of the benefits of an M-CMTS architecture is that it is extremely scalable to larger numbers of downstream channels.\n\n\n\n"}

Cancell is available in tablet and liquid form. Originally called Entelev, the formula was developed by biochemist James V. Sheridan. Sheridan sought to target the primarily anaerobic cell metabolism of cancer cells (following the theories of Otto Warburg), claiming to lower cell potential leading to the destruction of cancer cells. The Cancell formula was tested by the National Cancer Institute and found to be ineffective against cancer, though Cancell continues to be marketed as a dietary supplement in the US.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has listed the components as inositol, nitric acid, sodium sulfite, potassium hydroxide, sulfuric acid, and catechol. Precise formulation varies by manufacturer, and may include crocinic acid and various minerals and vitamins.\n\nResearchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) tested the constituents of Cancell in animal experiments in 1978 and 1980 and \"in vitro\" on human tumors in 1990 and 1991. They concluded that the compounds comprising Cancell could not be taken in doses high enough to kill cancer cells in the body, and that further study was not warranted. No peer-reviewed clinical or animal trials of Cancell have demonstrated any positive effect; claims for Cancell's efficacy are limited to anecdotal reports and testimonials. The American Cancer Society and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center recommend against the use of CanCell, as there is no evidence that it is effective in treating any disease, and its proposed method of action is not consistent with modern science.\n\nInjunction proceedings were instigated by the FDA in June 1987 for manufacturing compliance violations and failure to maintain complaints files. A complaint for permanent injunction was filed February 21, 1989 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan to enjoin Sheridan and Edward J. Sopcak from distributing CanCell. At a hearing in November 1992, the Court found Sopcak to be in civil contempt and ordered him to comply with the injunction immediately.\n\nCancell is currently distributed as a dietary supplement under the names \"Protocel\" and \"Entelev\", and is not approved by the FDA for use as a cancer treatment or for any other purpose. Since it is marketed as a dietary supplement with no health claims attached, its regulation falls under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1693165", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1693165", "title": "Concurrent estate", "text": "Concurrent estate\n\nA concurrent estate or co-tenancy is a concept in property law which describes the various ways in which property is owned by more than one person at a time. If more than one person owns the same property, they are commonly referred to as co-owners. Legal terminology for co-owners of real estate is either co-tenants or joint tenants, with the latter phrase signifying a right of survivorship. Most common law jurisdictions recognize tenancies in common and joint tenancies, and some also recognize tenancies by the entirety, which is a joint tenancy between married persons. Many jurisdictions refer to a joint tenancy as a joint tenancy with right of survivorship, but they are the same, as every joint tenancy includes a right of survivorship. In contrast, a tenancy in common does not include a right of survivorship.\n\nThe type of co-ownership does not affect the right of co-owners to sell their fractional interest in the property to others during their lifetimes, but it does affect their power to will the property upon death to their devisees in the case of joint tenants. However, any joint tenant can change this by severing the joint tenancy. This occurs whenever a joint tenant transfers his or her fractional interest in the property.\n\nLaw can vary from place to place, and the following general discussion will not be applicable in its entirety to all jurisdictions.\n\nUnder the common law, Co-owners share a number of rights by default:\n\n\nCo-owners generally do not have any obligation to contribute to any costs of \"improving\" the property. If one co-owner adds a feature that enhances the value of the property, that co-owner has no right to demand that any others share the cost of adding that feature even if other co-owners reap greater profits from the property because of it. However, at partition, a co-owner is entitled to recover the value added by his or her improvements of the property if the \"improvements\" resulted in an increase in property value. Conversely, if the co-owner's \"improvements\" decrease the value of the property, the co-owner is responsible for the decrease. In an Australian case, the High Court said that the costs of repairing by one co-owner must be taken into account on the partition or final distribution (i.e. sale) of the property.\n\nFurthermore, each co-owner can independently encumber the co-owner's own share in the property by taking out a mortgage on that share (although this may effectively convert a joint tenancy to a tenancy in common, as described below); other co-owners have no obligation to help pay a mortgage that only runs to another owner's share of the property, and the mortgagee can only foreclose on that mortgagor's share. Bank loans secured by mortgages on individual shares of co-owned property are one of the most rapidly expanding areas in the mortgage lending industry.\n\nFinally, co-owners owe one another a duty of fair dealing. Because of this, any co-owner who acquires a mortgage claim against the property must give his co-owners a reasonable opportunity to purchase proportionate shares in that claim.\n\nTenancy in common is a form of concurrent estate in which each owner, referred to as a tenant in common, is regarded by the law as owning separate and distinct shares of the same property. By default, all co-owners own equal shares, but their interests may differ in size.\n\nTIC owners own percentages in an undivided property rather than particular units or apartments, and their deeds show only their ownership percentages. The right of a particular TIC owner to use a particular dwelling comes from a written contract signed by all co-owners (often called a \"Tenancy In Common Agreement\"), not from a deed, map or other document recorded in county records. This form of ownership is most common where the co-owners are not married or have contributed different amounts to the purchase of the property. The assets of a joint commercial partnership might be held as a tenancy in common.\n\nTenants in common have no right of survivorship, meaning that if one tenant in common dies, that tenant's interest in the property will be part of his or her estate and pass by inheritance to that owner's devisees or heirs, either by will, or by intestate succession. Also, as each tenant in common has an interest in the property, they may, in the absence of any restriction agreed to between all the tenants in common, sell or otherwise deal with the interest in the property (e.g. mortgage it) during their lifetime, like any other property interest.\n\nWhere any party to a tenancy in common wishes to terminate (usually termed \"destroy\") the joint interest, he or she may obtain a \"partition of the property\". This is a division of the land into distinctly owned lots, if such division is legally permitted under zoning and other local land use restrictions. Where such division is not permitted, a forced sale of the property is the only alternative, followed by a division of the proceeds. (This paragraph is not the case in the law of England and Wales)\n\nIf the parties are unable to agree to a partition, any or all of them may seek the ruling of a court to determine how the land should be divided physically division between the joint owners (partition in kind), leaving each with ownership of a portion of the property representing their share. Courts may also order a partition by sale in which the property is sold and the proceeds are distributed to the owners. Where local law does not permit physical division, the court must order a partition by sale.\n\nEach co-owner is entitled to partition as a matter of right, meaning that the court will order a partition at the request of any of the co-owners. The only exception to this general rule is where the co-owners have agreed, either expressly or impliedly, to waive the right of partition. The right may be waived either permanently, for a specific period of time, or under certain conditions. The court, however, will likely not enforce this waiver because it is a restraint on the alienability of property.\n\nA joint tenancy or joint tenancy with right of survivorship (JTROS, JTWROS or JT TEN WROS) is a type of concurrent estate in which co-owners have a \"right of survivorship\", meaning that if one owner dies, that owner's interest in the property will pass to the surviving owner or owners by operation of law, and avoiding probate. The deceased owner's interest in the property simply evaporates and cannot be inherited by his or her heirs. Under this type of ownership, the last owner living owns all the property, and on his or her death the property will form part of their estate. Unlike a tenancy in common, where co-owners may have unequal interests in a property, joint co-owners have an equal share in the property.\n\nIt is important to note, however, that creditors' claims against the deceased owner's estate may, under certain circumstances, be satisfied by the portion of ownership previously owned by the deceased, but now owned by the survivor or survivors. In other words, the deceased's liabilities can sometimes remain attached to the property.\n\nThis form of ownership is common between spouses, parent and child, and in any other situation where parties want ownership to pass immediately and automatically to the survivor. For bank and brokerage accounts held in this fashion, the acronym JTWROS is commonly appended to the account name as evidence of the owners' intent.\n\nTo create a joint tenancy, clear language indicating that intent must be used e.g. \"to AB and CD as joint tenants with right of survivorship, and not as tenants in common\". This long form of wording may be especially appropriate in those jurisdictions which use the phrase \"joint tenancy\" as synonymous with a tenancy in common. Shorter forms such as \"to AB and CD as joint tenants\" or \"to AB and CD jointly\" can be used in most jurisdictions. Words to that effect may be used by the parties in the deed of conveyance or other instrument of transfer of title, or by a testator in a will, or in an inter vivos trust deed.\n\nIf a testator leaves property in a will to several beneficiaries \"jointly\" and one or more of those named beneficiaries dies before the will takes effect, then the survivors of those named beneficiaries will inherit the whole property on a joint tenancy basis. But if these named beneficiaries had been bequeathed the property on a tenancy in common basis, but died before the will took effect, then those beneficiaries' heirs would in turn inherit their share immediately (the named beneficiary being deceased).\n\nTo create a joint tenancy, the co-owners must share \"four unities\":\n\n\nIf any of these elements is missing, the joint tenancy is ineffective, and the joint tenancy will be treated as a tenancy in common in equal shares.\n\nIf any joint co-owner deals in any way with a property inconsistent with a joint tenancy, that co-owner will be treated as having terminated (sometimes called \"breaking\") the joint tenancy. The remaining co-owners maintain joint ownership of the remaining interest. The dealing may be a conveyance or sale of the co-owner's share in the property. The position in relation to a mortgage is more doubtful (see below). For example, if one of three joint co-owners conveys his or her share in the property to a third party, the third party owns a 1/3 share on a tenancy in common basis, while the other two original joint co-owners continue to hold the remaining 2/3s on a joint tenancy basis. This result arises because the \"unity of time\" is broken: that is, because on the transfer the timing of the new interest is different from the original one. If it is desired to continue to maintain a joint tenancy, then the three original joint co-owners would need to transfer, in the one instrument, the joint interest to the two remaining joint co-owners and the new joint co-owner.\n\nA joint co-owner may break a joint tenancy and maintain an interest in the property. Most jurisdictions permit a joint owner to break a joint tenancy by the execution of a document to that effect. In those jurisdictions which retain the old common law requirements, an actual exchange with a \"straw man\" is required. This requires another person to \"buy\" the property from the joint co-owner for some nominal consideration, followed immediately by a sale-back to the co-owner at the same price. In either case, the joint tenancy will revert to a tenancy in common as to that owner's interest in the property.\n\nA significant issue can arise with the simple document execution method. In the \"straw man\" approach, there are witnesses to the transfer. With the document, there may not be witnesses. With either method, as soon as the break occurs, it works both ways. Because there may not be witnesses, the party with the document could take advantage of that fact and hide the document when the other party dies.\n\nIf one joint co-owner takes out a mortgage on jointly owned property, in some jurisdictions this may terminate the joint tenancy. Jurisdictions which use a \"title theory\" in this situation treat a mortgage as an actual conveyance of title until the mortgage is repaid, if not permanently. In such jurisdictions, the taking of a mortgage by one owner terminates the joint tenancy as to that co-owner. There are exceptions, and the law in the State of Georgia is a notable exception.\n\nIn Georgia, joint tenancy is commonly conveyed in a deed as \"Joint Tenants with Rights of Survivorship\". The legal effect of this type of tenancy is a \"life estate\" with a \"contingent remainder\". Translated, this means that the interest of each joint tenant can be thought of in two parts: the \"present\" interest while the parties are both alive and what happens in the \"future\" when one of the tenants dies. Viewed separately, the interest of each independent co-tenant is only \"temporary\" interest while they both co-tenants are alive and neither owns a \"full\" interest. The \"full\" interest is determined by who outlives the other and vests automatically in the survivor at, and only at, the time of death. In the case of a mortgage executed by only one of the living joint tenants, the mortgage does not sever the tenancy. Instead, the mortgage is interpreted as conveying whatever interest the debtor holds. In this example, that would be the debtor's life (or \"temporary\") estate only, since both parties are still living, but the lender would also be entitled to the full estate, but only if the debtor were to outlive the other joint-tenant. Consequently, if the debtor dies first, the co-tenant, who is not party to the mortgage, would take full ownership interest of the property free and clear of the mortgage. However, just because a surviving co-tenant isn't liable on the mortgage does not mean that the mortgage is extinguished or that the property is not subject to foreclosure if the mortgage isn't paid. The Georgia Supreme Court decision of Manders v. King, 284 Ga. 338, 339, 667 S.E.2d 59, 60 (2008) is instructive. \"Georgia is one of several states adhering to the common-law doctrine of exoneration, which provides that, unless a will specifically provides otherwise, an heir or devisee of real property may look to the decedent's personal property for satisfaction of liens on devised real property, at the expense of the residuary legatees or distributees of the decedent's personal estate.\" J. Kraut, Annotation, Right of Heir or Devisee to Have Realty Exonerated from Lien Thereon at Expense of Personal Estate, 4 A.L.R.3d 1023, § 3. See Raines v. Shipley, 197 Ga. 448, 458, 29 S.E.2d 588 (1944) (“[U]nder the general law it was the duty of the executors to discharge this particular mortgage debt [on devised real property] from the personal property of the testatrix, if any she had...”). See also Killingsworth v. First Nat. Bank of Columbus, 237 Ga. 544, 546, 228 S.E.2d 901 (1976) (estate required to exonerate devised real property by paying balance of mortgage liens so long as the liens were debts of the testator and not an assumption of debts of a predecessor in title). Id. In Manders, the Court held “a surviving joint tenant does not qualify for exoneration of a mortgage on joint tenancy property unless there is language in the decedent's will clearly expressing an intention that the mortgage debt be paid.” In re Estate of Young, supra; In re Estate of Dolley, supra, 265 Cal.App.2d at 72.2. In short, if there is a mortgage on a property that was executed by only one joint-tenant and that joint-tenant dies, unless there is a specific provision in the Will of the deceased joint-tenant that estate assets should be used to pay the outstanding mortgage, then surviving joint-tenant is not exonerated from the mortgage and the property is subject to foreclosure if the mortgage goes into default.\n\nIn sum, under Georgia law, execution of a mortgage (called a \"Deed to Secure Debt\" or \"Security Deed\") by one co-tenant does not sever the joint tenancy.\n\nHowever, in jurisdictions which use the \"lien theory\", the mortgage merely places a lien on the property, leaving the joint tenancy undisturbed. As a lien is not enough to terminate a joint tenancy, if the debtor dies before the creditor sues, the creditor is left with no claim against the property, as the debtor's interest in the property evaporates and automatically vests in the other surviving co-owners.\n\nA co-owner of a joint tenancy with rights of survivorship deed may sever the joint tenancy by filing a petition to partition. A petition to partition is a legal right, so usually there is no way to stop such an action. When a court grants a partition action for a joint tenants with rights of survivorship deed, the property is either physically broken into parts and each owner is given a part of equal value OR the property is sold and the proceeds are distributed equally between the co-owners regardless of contribution to purchase price. No credits would be issued to any tenant who may have made a superior contribution toward purchase price.\n\nSome states allow a co-owner the option of buying out the other co-owners to avoid a public sale of the property. Some states also allow multiple co-owners to join their shares together to claim a majority ownership to avoid public sale of the property and to have the property awarded to the majority owners. If the property is sold publicly, the usual method is a public auction.\n\nDuring a partition process, credits may be granted to co-tenants who have paid property expenses in excess of their share, such as utilities and property maintenance. Credit may be given for improvements done to the property if the improvements have increased the value of the property. No credit would be given for excess contribution to purchase price, as joint tenancy with rights of survivorship deeds are taken in equal shares as a matter of law.\n\nPennsylvania partition case example:\nIn D’Arcy v. Buckley, 71 Bucks Co. L. Rep. 167 (August 21, 1998), two persons purchased property as joint tenants with right of survivorship. The Plaintiff contributed five times more than the Defendant toward the purchase price. In a partition action, the Plaintiff sought credit for the full amount of his superior contributions. The Court held that, in the absence of fraud, the working of the deed operated to convey a one-half interest to each of the two joint tenants. The decision relies the authorities of Masgai v. Masgai, 460 Pa. 453, 333 A.2d 861 (1975) and DeLoatch v. Murphy, 369 Pa. Super. 255, 535 A.2d 146 (1987). The Plaintiff argued, to no avail, that he did not intend to make a lifetime gift to defendant.\n\nA tenancy by the entirety (sometimes called a tenancy by the entireties) is a type of concurrent estate formerly available only to married couples, where ownership of property is treated as though the couple were a single legal person. (In the State of Hawaii, the option of Tenants by the Entirety ownership is also available to domestic partners in a registered \"Reciprocal Beneficiary Relationship\"; Vermont's Civil Union statute qualifies parties to a civil union for tenancy by the entirety.) Like a Joint Tenancy with Rights of Survivorship, the tenancy by the entirety also encompasses a right of survivorship, so if one spouse dies, the entire interest in the property is said to \"ripen\" in the survivor so that sole control of the property ripens, or passes in the ordinary sense, to the surviving spouse without going through probate.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, to create a tenancy by the entirety the parties must specify in the deed that the property is being conveyed to the couple \"as tenants by the entirety,\" while in others, a conveyance to a married couple is presumed to create a tenancy by the entirety unless the deed specifies otherwise. (see also Sociedad de gananciales) Also, besides sharing the four unities necessary to create a joint tenancy with right of survivorship time, title, interest, and possession there must also be the fifth unity of marriage. However, unlike a JTWROS, neither party in a tenancy by the entirety has a unilateral right to sever the tenancy. The termination of the tenancy or any dealing with any part of the property requires the consent of both spouses. A divorce breaks the unity of marriage, leaving the default tenancy, which may be a tenancy in common in equal shares. Many US jurisdictions no longer recognize tenancies by the entirety. Where it is recognized, benefits can include the ability to shield the property from creditors of only one spouse, as well as the ability to partially shield the property where only one spouse is filing a petition for bankruptcy relief. If a non-debtor spouse in a tenancy by the entirety survives a debtor spouse, the lien can never be enforced against the property. On the other hand, if a debtor spouse survives a non-debtor spouse, the lien may be enforced against the whole property, not merely the debtor spouse's original half-interest.\n\nIn many states, tenancy by the entireties is recognized as a valid form of ownership for bank accounts and financial assets. One must be careful to ensure that the tenancy by the entireties designation is chosen as opposed to other forms of joint ownership such as joint tenancy with rights of survivorship, so that the benefits of tenancy by the entireties status is not lost. For example, under Florida law, if a bank account titling document allows for tenancy by the entireties and joint tenancy with rights of survivorship, if the account is opened as a joint tenancy with rights of survivorship account, the benefits of tenancy by entireties will not attach.\n\nKurtz, Hovenkamp.

Lowell Five Cents Savings Bank\", 415 Mass. 145, 612 N.E. 2d 650.\n\nThere is nothing in the laws of Massachusetts, or New York as stated in \"Coraccio\", to prevent one tenant by the entirety from conveying her own or his own interest in the property, subject to the continuing rights of the other. While it is generally believed that one tenant by the entirety cannot convey their interest because the tenancy cannot be severed, rather it is the survivorship rights of the other that cannot be severed. Thus, if a husband conveyed his interest in the property held as tenants by the entirety to his brother, the husband no longer owns an interest in the property. The brother takes his (the husband's) place within the tenancy. Here is the tricky part: if the wife dies then the husband's brother acquires all interest in the real estate. If the husband dies before the wife then it all goes to her free and clear and the husband's brother has nothing. Some conveyancers have treated deeds by one tenant by the entirety as null. However, such a deed conveys the interest of the grantor in the property subject to the survivorship rights of the other co-tenant.\n\nTenancy By the Entirety at Common Law/effect of a conveyance by one:\n\n"}

{"id": "3186008", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3186008", "title": "Esquilache Riots", "text": "Esquilache Riots\n\nThe Esquilache Riots (\"Motín de Esquilache\") occurred in March 1766 during the rule of Charles III of Spain. Caused mostly by the growing discontent in Madrid about the rising costs of bread and other staples, they were sparked off by a series of measures regarding Spaniards' apparel that had been enacted by Leopoldo de Gregorio, Marqués de Esquilache, a Neapolitan minister whom Charles favored.\n\nEsquilache's plan was to terminate the wearing of long capes and broad-brimmed hats (\"chambergos\") by male \"madrileños\", replacing these traditional garments with French-style short capes and three-cornered hats. This reform was intended to modernize the appearance of conservative Spanish society and improve public safety, since the long capes were supposedly thought to facilitate the concealment of weapons, while the large hats were thought to conceal a person's face, a safeguard for criminals.\n\nThe new policies did not immediately catch the attention of the populace, as more pressing issues fanned the flames of popular discontent, namely the rising prices in bread, oil, coal, and cured meat, caused in part by Esquilache's liberalization of the grain trade. Moreover, these measures at first were only applied to the royal household and staff (January 21, 1766).\n\nUnder pain of arrest, these royal functionaries adopted the measures en masse. Having applied these initial measures, Esquilache proceeded to impose them on the general population. The writer and government official Pedro Rodríguez de Campomanes and the body known as the \"Council of Castile\" warned him that the confiscation of hats and cloaks would cause resentment amongst the people.\n\nEsquilache nevertheless went ahead with these measures, and on March 10, 1766 placards appeared in Madrid prohibiting the wearing of these garments. Popular reaction was immediate: the placards were torn off the walls. Soldiers were mobilized and local authorities were attacked by the populace. Rioters shouted \"Long Live Spain! Death to Esquilache!\"\n\nOn Palm Sunday, around 4 o'clock in the afternoon, two townsmen, dressed in the forbidden long capes and \"chambergos\", provocatively crossed the little square of Antón Martín. Several soldiers on guard duty stopped them to inquire about their garments. Insults were exchanged and the soldiers tried to detain them. One of the townsmen unsheathed a sword and whistled. A band of townspeople appeared and the soldiers fled. The rioters quickly took over Plaza de los Inválidos where muskets and sabers were stored. 2,000 rioters marched on the Calle Atocha to the Plaza Mayor, yelling insults against Esquilache. They ran into Luis Antonio Fernández de Córdoba y Spínola, the 11th Duke of Medinaceli, whom they surrounded, and they forced him to approach the king with a series of petitions.\n\nThe duke reported to the king, who remained calm, unaware of the seriousness of the situation. The rioters meanwhile had destroyed many of the 5,000 lampposts that had been erected throughout the city by order of the king as another well-intended modernization policy. The rioters' petition had included the demand that the unpopular \"Guardia Valona\" (Walloon Guard) be disbanded. This regiment of the Royal Guard was recruited in the Austrian Netherlands and formed part of the permanent garrison of Madrid. A servant attached to Esquilache's household was knifed when the rioters made their way to the minister's mansion, which they sacked. They also stoned the mansion of the Grimaldi and approached the mansion of the Sabatini. That night, a portrait of Esquilache was burned in the Plaza Mayor. The king still had done nothing.\n\nOn March 24, the situation worsened. The rioters, much strengthened in numbers and in confidence, marched towards where the king was residing, in the Arco de la Armería de Palacio, which was defended by Spanish troops alongside the Walloons.\n\nThe Walloon troops fired and killed a woman, increasing the number of rioters. A priest who made himself the rioters' representative managed to make his way to Charles and present him with the petitions. The priest's tone was ominous, and he promised to reduce the king's palace to rubble within two hours if the demands were not met. The rioters' demands included:\n\n\nThe king was inclined to accept the demands, despite being counselled not do so by several of his ministers. Those ministers who believed he should accept the rioters' demands emphasized that the riots were not a challenge against royal authority, but that they could develop into such should the demands be ignored. Charles appeared on the palace balcony. The rioters once again presented their demands. Charles calmly acceded to their demands. He and his Walloon Guard retired to the palace.\n\nThis act temporarily calmed the populace. However, fearing for his own safety, Charles then decided to retreat to Aranjuez with the rest of his family and his ministers, including Esquilache.\n\nA military junta took measures to restore order. The city remained calm. However, upon hearing that Charles had left secretly for Aranjuez, anger spread that the king had simply accepted the demands in order to make his subsequent escape. There were also fears that a large force of royal troops would approach Madrid and crush the revolt.\n\nIn reaction to these fears, some 30,000 people, including men, women, and children, surrounded the house of Diego Rojas Contreras, bishop of Cartagena and president of the Council of Castile. The bishop was instructed to inform the king of the popular mood and to draw up a series of demands. An emissary was sent to Aranjuez and the bishop remained trapped. Meanwhile, the townspeople had begun to sack military buildings and stores, releasing prisoners. The king replied with a letter that stated that he sincerely promised to comply with the demands of his people, and asked for calm and order.\n\nThis calmed the populace once again. Esquilache was also dismissed, a move that both Charles and Esquilache lamented. Esquilache felt that his modernizing reforms had deserved a statue, and would comment that he had cleaned and paved the city streets and had created boulevards and had nevertheless been dismissed. He was given the ambassadorship to Venice, where he subsequently died.\n\nStill fearing for his own safety, Charles remained at Aranjuez, leaving the government in the hands of his minister Pedro Pablo Abarca de Bolea, Count of Aranda. Doing so damaged his reputation. The king remained at Aranjuez as Aranda and troops were sent there to protect him. Aranda's arrival calmed Charles down but the king remained in the city until mid-April.\n\nIn Madrid, Aranda meanwhile had convinced the populace to adopt the French-style short capes and three-cornered hats, first meeting with the members of Madrid's five major guilds (\"Gremios Mayores\") and 53 minor guilds (\"Gremios Menores\"). Aranda managed to convince these members that the \"chambergo\" and the long cape was nothing but the apparel of \"el verdugo\" –the hated hangman or executioner- and that no respectable person would wear such a thing. The populace thus gradually and peacefully adopted more modern apparel.\n\nCharles III's advisers blamed the riots as a plot organized by the Jesuits. The riots thus helped seal the fate of the Jesuits, already not in favor in Charles III's court. One scholar states that \"Charles III would never had dared to expel the Jesuits had he not been assured of the support of an influential party within the Spanish Church.\" The Spanish Crown expelled the Jesuits in January 1767 and dismantled the Jesuit missions of the Americas.\n\nDespite the near-insurrection of the populace, Charles would continue his program of reforms. The painter Francisco de Goya, an eyewitness to these events, would paint his \"Motín de Esquilache\" around 1766-7.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7942340", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7942340", "title": "First tithe", "text": "First tithe\n\nThe first tithe (Hebrew: \"ma'aser rishon\" מעשר ראשון) is a positive commandment in the Torah requiring the giving of one tenth of agricultural produce, after the giving of the standard \"terumah,\" to the Kohen (Jewish priest) (or Levite). This giving is required to be free of both monetary and servicial compensation.\n\nHistorically, during the First Temple period, the first tithe was given to the Levite. Approximately at the beginning of the Second Temple construction, Ezra and his Beth din implemented its giving to the kohanim.\n\nThe tithe gift is discussed in the Hebrew Bible (Numbers ) according to which a tenth of the produce was to be presented to a Levite who then gave a tenth of the first tithe to a kohen (Numbers ). Tithing was seen as performing a mitzvah done in joyful obedience to God. Giving tithe would open oneself up to receipt of divine blessing.\n\nThe Torah instructs that the tithe should be of the \"five grains\", wine, olive oil, fruit, and cattle (Leviticus ). The time for taking such tithes was at the finished stage of processing the produce (Numbers ). Unlike \"terumah\" given to the Kohen, the \"ma'aser rishon\" was not regarded as sacred, and as a result did not have to be ritually pure, neither was it required to be eaten in any particular state (such as the Temple in Jerusalem). Once received by the Levite, it was regarded simply as ordinary property, and they could pass it on to non-Levites, or sell it, as they wished.\n\nTraditionally tithes were calculated for the produce of each whole year, however Chazalic Literature indicates that there was a debate between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel as to when this tithing year should begin and end. Tithing years had different starts and ends depending on the particular crop in question; land crops began their tithe year on the first of Tishrei (Rosh Hashanah); according to Eleazar ben Shammua and Simeon bar Yohai the first of Tishri was also the start of the tithe year for cattle, but according to Rabbi Meir it was the first of Elul that held this honour. The followers of Hillel argued that the tithe year for fruit from trees began on the fifteenth of Shevat, but the followers of Shammai, his rival, argued that it began on the first of Shevat; the view of Hillel's followers eventually became the majority view and the \"new year for trees\" — Tu Bishvat — is now held at the date which they considered appropriate.\n\nIn classical rabbinical literature, according to which the entire Torah was principally written by Moses, the first tithe is contrasted with the poor tithe, and second tithe, as entirely different tithes from each other, and for this reason gave the tithes the distinct names they possess; these latter tithes, which are mentioned by the Deuteronomic Code, differ by not covering cattle or fruit, and rather than just going to the Levites, are in one case shared among the poor and other charitable destinations, and in the other go to the food producer themselves. According to some secular scholars, the poor tithe and the second tithe, when taken together, are a conflicting version of the same single tithe as the first tithe; the poor tithe and second tithe together being the Deuteronomist's version and the first time being the version of the priestly source.\n\nAlthough such scholars speculate that the deuteronomist is a later author than the priestly source, scholars believe that much of the Deuteronomic Code was a reaction against the regulations introduced by the Priestly Code, and that here it reflects the earlier situation. In the Book of Ezekiel, which some scholars believe predates the Priestly Code, meaning that according to their view the Priestly Code must post-date the Babylonian Exile, there is no mention whatever of a tithe appointed for the Levites, and in the Deuteronomic Code, though Levites have a share of the \"ma'aser sheni\", their share is seemingly voluntary, and it can alternatively be given to strangers, widows, and/or paternal orphans; in the Priestly Code, however, donation of the tithe to the Levites is compulsory. Of course, if the \"ma'aser sheni\" tithe, also mentioned in Leviticus, were originally different from \"ma'aser rishon\", there is a simpler explanation for the variation.\n\nThe clear differentiation between the kohens (the \"priests\") and the other Levites, in the regulations given by the Priestly Code for the \"ma'aser rishon\", is a distinction scholars attribute to the pro-Aaronid political bias of the \"priestly source\"; according to the Biblical revisionists' worldview, all Levites can be legitimate priests, which is likely to be why the Deuteronomist does not mention a \"tithe of the tithe\" (the portion of the tithe which is given to the priests rather than other Levites), since it would be somewhat meaningless. On the other hand, it raises a question about the distinction between \"ma'aser\" and \"terumah\". In the Priestly Code it is stated that the \"ma'aser rishon\" existed as the source of sustenance for the Levites, since they had no territory, and hence nowhere to keep livestock or perform agriculture (Numbers ). but this seemingly neglects the existence of a number of scattered Levite cities; scholars believe that the tithe (i.e. the tithe of which the \"ma'sar ani\" and \"ma'aser rishon\" are conflicting versions) actually arose as a generic heave offering, given to priests at the sanctuaries for their sustenance, and only became distinct when the Aaronids began to position themselves as the only Levites that could be legitimate priests. This view neglects the fact that cities are not agricultural centers and the tithing laws focus on agricultural produce. According to a holistic view of the Torah, the Levites had no portion in the fields. The Book of Amos, cited by some scholars for support of their proposition, admonishes the Israelites about their rebellious offerings to idols by mentioning practices that would be acceptable to idolatry but not Torah Law. Thus, Amos sarcastically remarks that they bring \"for three days your tithes\", as well as saying that they should offer their \"todah\" offerings of leaven (which was forbidden, see Lev. ). Amos . The text itself does not bear out such scholars identification between \"ma'aser rishon\" and \"ma'sar ani\". First, the text clearly does not state \"three years,\" it states \"three days\". Second, the text expressly proposes deviant practices as forms of rebellion. Finally, the owner of the produce was not required to bring \"ma'sar ani\" to the Temple; but, rather to the poor, no matter where there were. Likewise, this confused story does not clearly demonstrate how \"ma'aser sheni\" developed into a system where the owner separated the tithe for himself and had nothing to do with kings or priests.\n\nOrthodox Judaism regards the tithe as still being required for any produce grown within the historic boundaries of the ancient Kingdoms of Israel and of Judah, covering the modern territories of the state of Israel, West Bank, Gaza Strip, Golan Heights, and portions of western Jordan. However, because \"ma'aser rishon\" has no inherent sanctity, consistent with Numbers (Levite tithes are wages), after \"terumat ma'aser\" has been removed, it is governed by the monetary civil laws which put the proof of a claim for monetary compensation on the person making the demand (the plaintiff). Since the lineage of the Levites is currently uncertain, there is no obligation to provide \"ma'aser rishon\" to a questionable Levi, whereas there is no rabbinic prohibition by doing so.\n\nContemporary practice, after designating and setting aside \"terumah\", is to make a formal declaration that the portion set aside is \"ma'aser rishon\". Afterwards, \"terumat ma'aser\" is designated and set aside. Finally, depending on the year, \"ma'aser sheni\" or \"ma'sar ani\" are designated and tithed in the appropriate manner.\n\nWhile tithes from produce may not be given to a Kohen or Levite, they may be fed to their animals.\n\n\n"}

The then Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown commissioned Andrew Gowers to lead the review in December 2005. The Review was published on 6 December 2006 as part of the Chancellor's annual pre-budget report. The review concludes that the UK's intellectual property system is fundamentally strong but made 54 recommendations for improvements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe review coincided with a 2006 survey carried out on behalf of the National Consumer Council, which indicated that over half of British adults infringe copyright law by duplicating and ripping music CDs. Following the review, in January 2008 the government initiated a public consultation period on proposals to legalise personal copying.\n\nOn November 27, 2006, it was reported that Gowers would not recommend for the copyright term of recorded music to be extended from the current 50 years after the date of recording. The British Phonographic Industry and prominent musicians, such as Cliff Richard and Ian Anderson, had lobbied for an extension to 95 years, matching the length of copyright provided in the United States; other musicians, such as Dave Rowntree of Blur provided counteropinions. The Gowers Review found that the UK, compared with the USA, suffers no apparent impediment to creativity due to this disparity. To coincide with the publication of the review on the 6 December a full-page advertisement entitled Fair play for musicians, was taken in the \"Financial Times\" of December 7, stating \"We call upon the UK Government to support the extension of copyright on sound recordings\", and was signed by over 4,500 musicians, including a few dead ones.\n\nRichard Sargeant, a civil servant who wrote large amounts of the Review, was later hired by Google. In January 2009, as Google's \"public policy manager\", he called for reforms to incorporate exemptions similar to the United States' fair use doctrine into UK and Europe copyright law.\n\n"}
{"id": "719613", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=719613", "title": "Gun laws in Finland", "text": "Gun laws in Finland\n\nGun laws in Finland incorporates the political and regulatory aspects of firearms usage in the country. Both hunting and shooting sports are common hobbies among Finns. There are approximately 300,000 people with hunting permits and 34,000 people belong to sport shooting clubs. Over 1500 people are licensed weapons collectors. Additionally, many reservists practice their skills using semi-automatic rifles and pistols after the military service.\n\nLegal firearms in Finland must be registered and licensed on a per-gun basis. There are approximately 1.5 million registered small firearms in the country. Out of those, 226,000 are short firearms (pistols, revolvers) with the rest being long firearms (rifles, shotguns). There are approximately 650,000 people with at least one permit which means 12% of Finns own a firearm. Overall, legal gun ownership rate is similar to countries such as Sweden, France, Canada and Germany. Estimates place the number of illegal, unregistered firearms between some tens of thousands and upwards of a million. A large portion of these are thought to be weapons hidden during the aftermath of World War II.\n\nThe current Firearms Act of 1998 is a near full rewrite of the earlier, 1933 law. The law was revised to comply with the European Firearms Directive after Finland joined the European Union. Following the school shooting incidents in 2007 and 2008 in which the perpetrators used .22 caliber semi-automatic pistols, legislation regarding short firearms was considerably tightened in 2011. Nevertheless, no types of firearms are outright banned, and in principle a person can apply for a licence for any type of gun.\n\nThe ownership and use of firearms is regulated by the Firearms Act of 1998. A license is always needed for possession of a firearm and all firearms are registered. Firearms may only be carried while they are being used for a specific purpose (e.g. hunting, shooting at the range). When transporting a firearm to or from such activity, the firearm must be unloaded and stored in a case or pouch. The owner of a firearm is responsible for making sure that firearms and ammunition do not end up in unauthorized hands. The exact requirements regarding storage of firearms depends on their type and quantity.\n\nAir guns up to 6.35 mm (0.25 inch) in caliber are not regulated regardless of their muzzle energy. Larger bore air weapons need a permit, unless the person already holds a firearms licence. Bows and crossbows are not regulated items in Finland, while pepper spray is. Suppressors are considered firearm components, but can be used with without requiring any separate licensing. Magazine capacity is not restricted nor is there regulation regarding other firearm accessories.\n\nAn unlicensed person may use firearms only under direct supervision. Simple unlawful possession of a firearm is punishable by fine or up to two years in prison, although more severe punishments may apply e.g. in the case of fully automatic weapons or when used to commit other crime. However, an unlicensed firearm may always be turned in without repercussions, provided this happens at the initiative of the person in possession of the firearm.\n\nCertain types of ammunition, such as expanding pistol rounds or incendiary rounds, require special authorization (in addition to a firearms licence) to purchase. The amount of ammunition a person may possess is not limited by the Firearms Act. However, legislation related to the safe storage of explosive materials does apply. Ordinarily, this means a maximum of 20,000 rounds of ammunition (including loose primers) and 2 kg of gunpowder per household, with larger quantities requiring separate storage.\n\nCurrently, work is underway to streamline the license application process in straightforward cases. An applicant who already has existing permits and has a proven track-record with responsible ownership would be able to apply for further permits more easily.\n\nIn 2017, the EU adopted changes to the Firearms Directive that became known as the \"EU Gun Ban\". The changes will need to be implemented in local legislation.\n\nWhen applying for a licence to purchase a firearm, the applicant must fill in a form with information such as the type and mode of operation of firearm, and the intended purpose of use (although one can use any firearm for any legal purpose regardless of the original application, e.g. a range gun for hunting or vice versa). According to the law, the firearm must be appropriate for the stated purpose, but evaluating this is largely left to the discretion of the police. For example, while an AR-15 is suitable for practical shooting, the police may consider one inappropriate for hunting.\n\nValid reasons for obtaining a firearms license are:\n\nThe application process includes a check of criminal records, the police interviewing the applicant and in some cases a computer-based personality test or a medical health certificate. Any significant history with violence or other crime, substance abuse or mental health issues will cause the application to be rejected. Membership in a hunting or shooting club or other appropriate organization is considered a positive, though membership can not be legally required as the Constitution of Finland guarantees freedom of association.\n\nIf the application is approved, an acquisition permit is mailed to the applicant. A dealer (or private person) may only sell a firearm if the buyer has the appropriate paperwork to show. There is no waiting period as such, but in practice processing an application takes a minimum of several days, usually a few weeks. Licences can be valid either until further notice or for a fixed term, which is sometimes the case for a people applying for their first license, and always with the first pistol license. A licence-holder may also borrow other firearms from the same or lesser category (e.g. a rifle licence is valid for borrowing shotguns and small-caliber rifles, but not pistols) and purchase ammunition for any firearm he owns or is permitted to borrow.\n\nClassification of firearms\n\nFor legal purposes, firearms are divided into 12 different types:\n\nFirearms are further divided into four modes of operation:\n\nSub-compact pistols\n\nA pistol is considered sub-compact or a \"pocket gun\" if it fits in a rectangular box of 180 x 130 mm, as is a revolver that fits in a box of 190 x 140 mm. Special legislation applies to these easily concealed firearms and they are not licensed for sporting purposes. Some common pistols such as Glock 19 fall under this description, and are therefore generally unavailable to e.g. IPSC shooters in Finland.\n\nSpecially dangerous weapons\n\nSome types of weapons are considered \"specially dangerous\". Licences for such weapons can only be granted on a very limited basis and are essentially for recognized collectors and filming purposes only. A weapon is considered specially dangerous if:\n\n\nShort-barreled rifles and carbines\n\nShort-barreled rifles and pistol carbines fall under the any other firearm category and, while not restricted by law, are more difficult to get a licence for. The primary concern is again that, being easy to conceal, they are particularly dangerous should they be stolen and fall into criminal hands.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s roughly 7% of firearm licenses were granted for the purpose of personal protection. Since 1998 new licences have not been granted on that basis, although existing permits remain valid. It is still possible to obtain a licence for pepper spray for the purpose of self-defense if a concrete threat exists. Carrying a firearm licensed for hunting or sporting use outside of that specific activity is not allowed. One can nevertheless legally defend himself by any means available, including firearms. Any use of force must always be proportional to the threat.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2015, firearms were used in 15% of all homicides. In 73% of these the firearm was illegally possessed by the perpetrator.\n\nThe two school shootings in Jokela in 2007 and Kauhajoki in 2008 are by far the worst mass murders in Finland, with 8 and 10 victims, respectively. In both cases the perpetrator was armed with a .22 rimfire pistol licensed only shortly before. In the case of Pekka-Eric Auvinen, the original application was for a 9 mm pistol, but this was rejected. In the aftermath police were blamed for being too lax in issuing licences, as neither perpetrator had any significant history with sports shooting. Police defended their decision, stating that nothing suspicious had come up with the information available, so there was no reason to reject the application. Legislation was revised in 2011 and now pistol licenses can only be issued following a two-year period of documented, active pistol shooting hobby, and only to persons 20 years old or older.\n\nIn 2013, firearms (both legally and illegally held) were used in 18% of suicides. Some consider this a problem and would like to see stricter firearms legislation. Others point out that the number of suicides is already steadily going down, while the number of firearms has remained constant. \n\nMilitary service guns are stored by the Finnish Defence Forces, and are only given out during reservist training or mobilization. At present, a strong political consensus exists that military weapons should not be stored by individuals, even if they are reservists in first-line, quick response units.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "57836368", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57836368", "title": "Hybrid Access Networks", "text": "Hybrid Access Networks\n\nHybrid Access Networks refer to a special architecture for broadband access networks where two different network technologies are combined to improve bandwidth. A frequent motivation for such Hybrid Access Networks is to combine one xDSL network with a wireless network such as LTE. The technology is generic and can be applied to combine different types of access networks such as DOCIS, WiMAX, 5G or satellite networks. The Broadband Forum has specified an architecture for the deployment of such networks.\n\nOne of the main motivations for such Hybrid Access Networks is to provide faster Internet services in rural areas where it is not always cost effective to deploy faster xDSL technologies such as G.Fast or VDSL2 that cannot cover long distances between the street cabinet and the home. Several governments, notably in Europe, require network operators to provide fast Internet services to all inhabitants with a minimum of 30 Mbps by 2020.\n\nA second use case is to improve the reliability of the access link given that it is unlikely that both the xDSL network and the wireless network will fail at the same time.\n\nA third motivation is the fast service turnup. The customer can immediately install the hybrid network access and use the wireless leg while the network operator is installing the wired part.\n\nSeveral techniques are defined by the Broadband Forum to create Hybrid Access Networks. To illustrate them, we assume that the enduser has an hybrid CPE router that is attached to both a wired access network such as xDSL and a wireless on such as LTE. Other deployments are possible, e.g. the enduser might have two different access routers that are linked together by a cable instead of a single hybrid CPE router.\n\nThe first deployment scenario is where the network operator provides a hybrid CPE router to each subscriber but no specialised equipment in the operator's network. There are two possible configurations for IP addresses. A first deployment scenario is to allocate different IP addresses to the wired and wireless interfaces. In this case, the hybrid CPE router needs to load-balance intelligently the packets over the two networks. In particular, it must ensure that all packets belonging to a given TCP connection are sent over the same interface. A second deployment scenario is to allocate the same IP address to both the wired and the wireless networks and configure the routing in these networks to ensure that packets or correctly routed.\n\nThe second deployment scenario is where the network operator provides a hybrid CPE router to each subscriber and installs a Hybrid Aggregation Gateway inside its access networks. The Hybrid Aggregation Gateway plays an important role in balancing the packets sent by and destined to the hybrid CPE router over the two access networks. Two technologies have been defined and deployed to enable hybrid CPE routers to interact with Hybrid Aggregation Gateways. The main objective of these technologies is to efficiently use the two access links even if they have different delay and bandwidth. One technical difficulty that occurs when distributing packets over such heterogeneous links is to accurately detect congestion, notably on the wireless network whose bandwidth can vary quickly, and cope the reordering which is caused by the delay difference. One approach uses GRE tunnels to hide the two links to the upper layer protocol. Both the hybrid CPE and the HAG need to reorder the received packets to ensure that TCP receives in-sequence packets. The second approach uses Multipath TCP, a recent TCP extension that has been designed to precisely enable the transmission of the packets that belong to a single connection to different links. More precisely, Multipath TCP proxies are installed on both the hybrid CPE router and on the Hybrid Aggregation Gateway. When a client behind the hybrid CPE router initiates a TCP connection, this connection is automatically converted in a Multipath TCP connection which is proxied by the Hybrid Aggregation Gateway before being forwarded to the final server. This approach leverages the ability of Multipath TCP to efficiently handle congestion and cope with reordering on the heterogeneous access links. Two approaches have been defined for the interactions between the hybrid CPE router and the Hybrid Aggregation Gateway. The transparent mode is used when the Hybrid Aggregation Gateway is placed on the path of all packets sent by the hybrid CPE router. Otherwise, the Hybrid Aggregation Gateway includes a TCP converter as defined in \n\nSeveral deployments of Hybrid Access Networks have already been documented.\n\n"}

{"id": "5254035", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5254035", "title": "Inherent jurisdiction", "text": "Inherent jurisdiction\n\nInherent jurisdiction is a doctrine of the English common law that a superior court has the jurisdiction to hear any matter that comes before it, unless a statute or rule limits that authority or grants exclusive jurisdiction to some other court or tribunal. The term is also used when a governmental institution derives its jurisdiction from a fundamental governing instrument such as a constitution. In the English case of \"Bremer Vulkan Schiffbau und Maschinenfabrik v. South India Shipping Corporation Ltd\", Lord Diplock described the court's inherent jurisdiction as a general power to control its own procedure so as to prevent its being used to achieve injustice. \n\nInherent jurisdiction appears to apply to an almost limitless set of circumstances. There are four general categories for use of the court's inherent jurisdiction:\n\n\nAs such, the exercise of inherent jurisdiction is a broad doctrine allowing a court to control its own processes and to control the procedures before it. The power stems not from any particular statute or legislation, but rather from inherent powers invested in a court to control the proceedings brought before it.\n\nAccording to the case law in Canada, the key restriction on the application of inherent jurisdiction is that the doctrine cannot be used to override an existing statute or rule. The clearest articulation of such restriction is set out in the Supreme Court of Canada decision in \"College Housing Co-operative Ltd. v Baxter Student Housing Ltd. (1976)\" which was a case dealing with whether a judge had exceeded jurisdiction in determining the mortgagee should have priority over other charges and encumbrances. The Supreme Court of Canada stated that a court cannot negate the unambiguous expression of legislative will and further held that:\nInherent jurisdiction cannot, of course, be exercised so as to conflict with statute or rule. Moreover, because it is a special and extraordinary power, it should be exercised only sparingly and in a clear case.\nAnother restriction on the application of the doctrine of inherent jurisdiction appears to be that inherent jurisdiction cannot be used to create new rules of substantive law.\n\nThe rules of civil procedure in various provinces in Canada have varying relationships with the inherent jurisdiction of their courts. In Ontario the Rules of Civil Procedure are considered to be regulations of the Courts of Justice Act, and thus an expression of legislative will. They are created and amended by a \"Civil Rules Committee\" which consists of fourteen judges and thirteen other persons involved in the legal community including the Attorney General or his representative. The rules are subject to the approval of the Lieutenant Governor in Council. The judges of the Court obviously have a part in the making of the rules, but the rules are regulations under the Act. Inherent jurisdiction cannot be used to conflict with the unambiguous expression of the Rules.\n\nIn Nova Scotia, on the other hand, the Rules of Civil Procedure are made by the judges of the Superior Court and the Court of Appeal pursuant to s.46 of the Judicature Act. The Attorney General does not have a hand in their creation, and they are not subject to approval by the Lieutenant Governor in Council. The Court of Appeal for Nova Scotia has taken the position that a single judge of the court may use the inherent jurisdiction of the court to manage its own procedures.\n\n"}

Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 (1905), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld the authority of states to enforce compulsory vaccination laws. The Court's decision articulated the view that the freedom of the individual must sometimes be subordinated to the common welfare and is subject to the police power of the state.\n\nPastor Henning Jacobson already lived through an era of mandatory vaccinations back in his original home in Sweden. The national law made vaccination mandatory and when he was a child, he was vaccinated for smallpox. Although the efforts to eradicate smallpox were successful in Sweden, he did not agree with the methods. He said vaccination caused him \"great and extreme suffering\" that he would have to endure for the rest of his life. One of his sons \"suffered adverse effects\" after being vaccinated as a child. Jacobson and his wife were thus resistant when it came to mandatory vaccinations in Massachusetts. \n\nA leader in his community, Jacobson was one of the few who resisted mandatory vaccinations for smallpox in the early 20th century in Cambridge, Massachusetts. While many were pleased to hear about a vaccine for smallpox, others were alarmed by the idea of being stabbed by a needle and having cowpox injected inside of them. Jacobson was distraught by this and took his case against mandatory vaccinations to the Supreme Court in 1905. He refused the vaccine stating it was an \"invasion of his liberty\", and was prosecuted. The penalty for vaccination refusal was a $5 monetary fine (). Pastor Jacobson refused vaccination saying that \"he and his son had had bad reactions to earlier vaccinations\". Because of his refusal to get vaccinated, Jacobson was fined $5 and appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment was brought up during the case on individual liberty. The case showed that the State was \"restricting one aspect of liberty\" by forcing people to get vaccinated. In its ruling in support of the Massachusetts law, the Supreme Court identified two primary rationales. One was that \"the state may be justified in restricting individual liberty... under the pressure of great dangers\" to the safety of the \"general public\". By identifying the ongoing smallpox epidemic as a danger to the general public, the court ruled that individual rights and liberty were subordinate to the state's obligation to eradicate the disease. Jacobson had also argued that the law requiring vaccination was \"arbitrary or oppressive\". The Court rejected the argument stating that mandatory immunization in the face of epidemic was not arbitrary or oppressive, but a measure for \"getting to their goal of eradicating smallpox\". Massachusetts was one of only 11 states that had compulsory vaccination laws.\n\nJustice John Marshall Harlan delivered the decision for a 7-2 majority. He rejected Jacobson's claim that the Fourteenth Amendment gave him the right to refuse vaccination.\nHarlan deemed that the Massachusetts state punishment of a fine or imprisonment on those who refused vaccines was acceptable, but those individuals could not be forcibly vaccinated. At the end of his decision, he acknowledged that for certain individuals, the requirement of vaccination would be cruel and inhumane and therefore an overreach of government power. That created a medical exemption for adults under the Massachusetts health law, but Harlan denied that Henning Jacobson deserved exemption.\n\nHarlan ruled that personal liberties could be suspended when \"the safety of the general public may demand\" for example during a smallpox outbreak. He compared the smallpox outbreak to the American Civil War (in which three out of nine Justices at the term served) by saying that a community has the right to protect itself from both disease and military invasion.\n\nMore broadly, Harlan ruled that Massachusetts was justified in mandating vaccination: \"there are manifold restraints to which each person is necessarily subject for the common good\". While Harlan supported such restraints, he also warned that if the state targeted specific individuals or populations to unnecessary restrictions, the court might have to step in to protect them.\n\nThat was a few years after \"Wong Wai v. Williamson\" in which a federal circuit court injunction in San Francisco was overturned. It required all Chinese residents of San Francisco to get a dangerous bubonic plague inoculation if they wished to leave the city, which Judge William Morrow ruled was \"boldly directed against the Asiatic or Mongolian race as a class\".\n\nHarlan's decision supported both police power and limits on the power, and his decision would be invoked to support both in later cases. He stated his nuanced opinion on the limits of government power by saying that \"general terms should be so limited in their application as not to lead to injustice, oppression or absurd consequence\". \n\nThe anti-vaccine movement mobilized following the decision and the Anti-Vaccination League of America was founded three years later in Philadelphia to promote the principle that \"health is nature's greatest safeguard against disease and that therefore no State has the right to demand of anyone the impairment of his or her health.\" The League warned about what it believed to be the dangers of vaccination and the dangers of allowing the intrusion of government and science into private life, part of the broader process identified with the Progressive Movement. The League asked, \"We have repudiated \"religious\" tyranny; we have rejected \"political\" tyranny; shall we now submit to \"medical\" tyranny?\"\n\nThe Supreme Court reaffirmed its decision in \"Jacobson\" in \"Zucht v. King\" (1922), which held that a school system could refuse admission to a student who failed to receive a required vaccination.\n\n\n"}

The Constitution of Denmark does not expressly authorise the courts to review statutes, but the courts have inferred the right from its provisions.\n\nAs the constitution does not mention whether the courts can overturn legislative acts, it has been debated in Danish legal theory whether the courts are able to do this. However the courts have assumed this right which has been accepted by the government as well as parliament.\n\nThere have been little debate whether the courts were able to examine whether the formal constitutional procedures connected to the creation of a law has been followed. The courts have done this in a few cases but have never ruled a law unconstitutional due to non-compliance with formal procedure.\n\nPreviously it has been debated whether the courts were able to examine whether a law was in compliance with the material provisions of the constitution. However there is a consensus in recent legal theory that the courts have this power, citing a longstanding precedence. In 1912 the supreme court assumed that it had the power to try the constitutionality of tithe abolition laws. In 1921 the supreme court came close to declare a land reform law unconstitutional; and it was only because a judge changed his vote that the law was considered constitutional.\n\nThe first time a law was declared unconstitutional was in 1971 when a law demanded that a foundation under the University of Copenhagen was to transfer its collection of Icelandic manuscripts and its capital to the University of Iceland without compensation. The foundation contested that this was violating the constitutional ban on expropriation without compensation. The supreme court ruled that the foundation was to transfer the manuscripts without compensation but not its capital.\n\nThe second time a law was declared unconstitutional was in a 1980 case concerning whether a law banning private shipping companies from transporting goods to and from Greenland. In reality there was only one company affected by the law and the eastern high court ruled that the law expropriated the business of that shipping company and awarded the company a compensation.\nThe third and most recent case where a law was ruled unconstitutional is from 1999, where several named individual schools from the Tvind network was cut off from government funding. The law was passed because the schools were suspected of receiving funding based on forged numbers of students. To avoid a lot of lawsuits a law was passed cutting the Tvind schools from government funding and barring them from suing the government over the lost funding. The supreme court declared this to be a violation of the separation of powers and declared the law unconstitutional.\n\nAs the Danish courts are formally only able to decide in concrete cases an unconstitutional law is technically still in force. However a court ruling that a law is unconstitutional means that authorities will not again try to apply the law as they would expect to be met with a lawsuit they are guaranteed to lose. There has been several cases on the constitutionality of Danish membership of the European Union. It is unclear what the political response would be if a law on accession to an EU treaty was found unconstitutional.\n\nSince the courts are only competent to rule in concrete disputes not everyone can sue the state for passing an unconstitutional law. To do this the plaintiff has to have a legal interest in the case. However in 1996 the supreme court ruled that a group of citizens had legal interest in suing the prime minister over the law on accession to the European Union. The supreme court found that accession to the European Union was affecting the entire population in many substantial areas and that every Danish citizen thus had legal interest in the constitutionality of Danish accession to the EU.\n\nDenmark has no specialised constitutional court and thus the question on the constitutionality of a law is to be contested before the ordinary courts. All courts are able to rule on the constitutionality of a law but in practice such highly political cases would be appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\nAs for judicial review of acts of the administration rather than pieces of legislation, Article 63 of the Danish constitution provides that the judiciary is entitled to try any question relating to the limits to the executive's powers. This is traditionally construed to mean that beyond the sphere of criminal procedure, unless otherwise provided for by legislation, the judiciary may try any question of fact and of law, whereas courts traditionally do not review discretion exercised by the administration. In certain areas, however, such as tax law, courts exercise a wider review, as well as in cases concerning just reparation for expropriation of property, as provided for by Article 73(3) of the Danish constitution. Other areas where the standard of scrutiny may traditionally be less extensive include, inter alia, cases of royal prerogative, such as foreign policy actions of the executive.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "943115", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=943115", "title": "Lee v. Weisman", "text": "Lee v. Weisman\n\nLee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577 (1992), was a United States Supreme Court decision regarding school prayer. It was the first major school prayer case decided by the Rehnquist Court. It ruled that schools may not sponsor clerics to conduct even non-denominational prayer. The Court followed a broad interpretation of the Establishment Clause that had been standard for decades at the nation's highest court, a reaffirmation of the principles of such landmark cases as \"Engel v. Vitale\" and \"Abington v. Schempp\".\n\nRobert E. Lee was the principal of Nathan Bishop Middle School in Providence, Rhode Island. He invited a rabbi to deliver a prayer at the 1989 graduation ceremony, but the parents of student Deborah Weisman requested a temporary injunction to bar the rabbi from speaking. The question being reviewed was whether or not this was constitutional. The Rhode Island district court denied the Weismans' motion. The family did attend the graduation ceremony, and the rabbi did deliver the benediction. \n\nThe Weismans continued their litigation after the graduation and won a victory at the First Circuit Court of Appeals. The school district appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that the prayer was nonsectarian and was doubly voluntary: Deborah was free not to stand for the prayer and because participation in the ceremony itself was not required. Arguments were heard on November 6, 1991. Justice Anthony Kennedy had been critical of the Court's decisions on school prayer, and many court watchers thought that he would provide the crucial fifth vote to reverse the lower court's ruling and deal a major blow to the twin separationist pillars of \"Engel\" and \"Abington\".\n\nThe 5–4 decision was announced on June 24, 1992. It was somewhat surprising as a victory for the Weismans and a defeat for the school district. Justice Kennedy wrote the majority opinion, which maintained previous Supreme Court precedents sharply limiting the place of religion within the nation's public schools—far from joining those who favored curtailing restrictions on school prayers. The Blackmun papers reveal that Kennedy switched his vote during the deliberations, as he also did in \"Planned Parenthood v. Casey\", saying that his draft majority opinion upholding the prayer exercise \"looked quite wrong.\" Instead, Kennedy wrote an opinion that repudiated the school district's main arguments. He found fault with Principal Lee's decision to give the rabbi who was planning to offer the graduation invocation a pamphlet on composing prayers for civic occasions:\n\nKennedy also noted that the nonsectarian nature of the prayer was no defense, as the Establishment Clause forbade coerced prayers in public schools, not just those representing a specific religious tradition. He addressed the State's contention that attendance was voluntary at the graduation exercises:\n\nFinally, Kennedy formulated what is now known as the coercion test in answering the argument that participation in the prayer was voluntary:\n\nJustice Blackmun's concurrence stressed that \"our decisions have gone beyond prohibiting coercion, however, because the Court has recognized that 'the fullest possible scope of religious liberty,' entails more than freedom from coercion.\" Blackmun emphasized that the government was without power to place its imprimatur on any religious activity, even if no one was compelled to participate in a state-sponsored religious exercise, directly or indirectly.\n\nJustice Souter devoted his concurring opinion to a historical analysis, rebutting the contention that the government could endorse nonsectarian prayers. He cited the writings of James Madison and pointed to the changing versions of the First Amendment that the First Congress considered, as opposed to the version which was eventually adopted. Souter, too, took issue with the school district's defense of non-coercive religious exercises, dismissing the position as without precedential authority.\n\nJustice Scalia's dissent argued against the coercion test:\n\nScalia pointed to several historical examples of calling on divine guidance by American Presidents, including Washington's proclamation of the Thanksgiving holiday in 1789 and the inaugural addresses of both Madison and Thomas Jefferson. He disputed the Court's contention that attendance at high school graduation ceremonies was effectively required as part of social norms, and also the conclusion that students were subtly coerced to stand for the rabbi's invocation. In Scalia's view, only official penalties for refusing to support or adhere to a particular religion created an Establishment Clause violation.\n\nThe coercion test is now used to determine the constitutionality of certain government actions under the Establishment Clause, along with the Lemon test and Justice O'Connor's \"endorsement or disapproval\" test. The test \"seeks to determine whether the state has applied coercive pressure on an individual to support or participate in religion.\"\n\nA broad reading of the Establishment Clause won out, but it seems to have its greatest current application in a public school context. The Court has ruled against the separationist position in several key funding cases since \"Lee\", including the school voucher case \"Zelman v. Simmons-Harris\". However, a majority of the Court continues to maintain a strict ban on most forms of state-sponsored religious exercises in schools themselves, as evidenced by the 6–3 ruling in \"Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe\", which struck down student-led prayers before public school football games.\n\n\n"}

Many scholars have also concluded that those who meet the legal requirements for U.S. citizenship \"at the moment of birth\", regardless of place of birth, are also natural-born citizens. Every president to date was either a citizen at the adoption of the Constitution in 1789 or was born in the United States; of these there have been seven that had at least one parent who was not born on U.S. soil.\n\nThe natural-born-citizen clause has been mentioned in passing in several decisions of the United States Supreme Court, and by some lower courts that have addressed eligibility challenges, but the Supreme Court has never directly addressed the question of a specific presidential or vice-presidential candidate's eligibility as a natural-born citizen. Many eligibility lawsuits from the 2008, 2012, and 2016 election cycles were dismissed in lower courts due to the challengers' difficulty in showing that they had standing to raise legal objections. Additionally, some experts have suggested that the precise meaning of the natural-born-citizen clause may never be decided by the courts because, in the end, presidential eligibility may be determined to be a non-justiciable political question that can be decided only by Congress rather than by the judicial branch of government.\n\nSection 1 of of the United States Constitution sets forth the eligibility requirements for serving as president of the United States, under clause 5 (emphasis added):\n\nThe Twelfth Amendment states, \"No person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.\" The Fourteenth Amendment does not use the phrase \"natural-born citizen\". It does provide, \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\"\n\nUnder Article One, representatives and senators are required to be U.S. citizens, but there is no requirement that they be natural born.\n\nThe use of the term \"natural born\" was not without precedent. An early recorded mention was in Calvin's Case (1608), in terms of birth within the jurisdiction of the sovereignty of the King. Statutes in Britain prior to American independence used the phrase \"natural born subject\". For example, clause III of the Foreign Protestants Naturalization Act 1708 provided:\n\nThe Act was repealed (except for the quoted clause III regarding foreign-born children) by the Tories in 1711 by the statute 10 Anne c. 5.\n\nSubsequently, the British Nationality Act 1730 provided:\n\nfor the explaining the said recited Clause in the said Act . . . [t]hat all Children born out of the Ligeance of the Crown of England, or of Great Britain, or which shall hereafter be born out of such Ligeance, whose Fathers were or shall be natural-born Subjects of the Crown of England, or of Great Britain, at the Time of the Birth of such Children respectively ... are hereby declared to be natural-born Subjects of the Crown of Great Britain, to all Intents, Constructions and Purposes whatsoever.\n\nAnother use is in the Plantation Act 1740:\n\nJurist William Blackstone wrote in 1765 that \"Natural-born subjects are such as are born within the dominions of the crown of England\". Blackstone added that offspring who are not inhabitants may also be natural born subjects:\n\nIn 1775, however, Blackstone reversed his opinion and explained that the children \"are now deemed to be natural-born subjects\" rather than \"are now natural-born subjects.\" Similarly, Francis Plowden initially explained that an early English statute made foreign-born children of English parents \"in fact and law . . . true native subjects\" and that the eighteenth-century British statutes made persons natural-born subjects by statute law just as others were natural-born subjects by the common law. However, after further consideration he also reversed his opinion and concluded in 1785 that the statutes did not make the children natural born subjects—rather, there remained a \"relict of alienage in them.\" Prior to Blackstone, Edward Coke offered a narrower opinion in \"Calvin's Case\". According to Coke: \"[I]f any of the King's ambassadors in foreign nations, have children there of their wives, being English women, by the common laws of England they are natural-born subjects, and yet they are born out-of the King's dominions.\"\n\nThe term \"natural born\" has often been used synonymously with \"native born\". The English lexicographer Samuel Johnson wrote in 1756 that the word \"natural\" means \"native,\" and that the word \"native\" may mean either an \"inhabitant\" or an \"offspring\".\n\nFrom the Declaration of Independence (1776) to the ratification of the Constitution (1789), the thirteen states were independent of Britain, and during much of this time the Articles of Confederation tied together the country. The phrase \"natural born citizen\" was sometimes used during this period. An example occurred in 1784 when the Maryland General Assembly conferred citizenship on the (French-born) Marquis de Lafayette:\n\nThe Constitution does not explain the meaning of \"natural born\". On June 18, 1787, Alexander Hamilton submitted to the Convention a sketch of a plan of government. The sketch provided for an executive \"Governour\" but had no eligibility requirements. At the close of the Convention, Hamilton conveyed a paper to James Madison he said delineated the Constitution that he wished had been proposed by the Convention; he had stated its principles during the deliberations. Max Farrand wrote that it \"was not submitted to the Convention and has no further value than attaches to the personal opinions of Hamilton.\" Article IX, section 1 of Hamilton's draft constitution provided: \"No person shall be eligible to the office of President of the United States unless he be now a Citizen of one of the States, or hereafter be born a Citizen of the United States.\"\n\nOn July 25, 1787, John Jay wrote to George Washington, presiding officer of the Convention:\n\nPermit me to hint, whether it would not be wise and seasonable to provide a strong check to the admission of Foreigners into the administration of our national Government, and to declare expressly that the Command in chief of the American army shall not be given to, nor devolve on, any but a natural Citizen.\n\nWhile the Committee of Detail originally proposed that the President must be merely a citizen, as well as a resident for 21 years, the Committee of Eleven changed \"citizen\" to \"natural born citizen\", and the residency requirement to 14 years, without recorded explanation after receiving Jay's letter. The Convention accepted the change without further recorded debate.\n\nIn 2012, Abdul Karim Hassan filed several unsuccessful lawsuits that claimed the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment had superseded the natural-born-citizen clause; he had argued natural-born citizenship was a form of discrimination based on national origin.\n\nMore than two dozen proposed constitutional amendments have been introduced in Congress to relax the restriction. Two of the more well known were introduced by Representative Jonathan Bingham in 1974, with the intent to allow German-born Secretary of State Henry Kissinger (otherwise fourth in the line of succession) to become eligible, and the Equal Opportunity to Govern Amendment by Senator Orrin Hatch in 2003, intending to allow eligibility for Austrian-born Arnold Schwarzenegger. The Bingham amendment would have also made clear the eligibility of those born abroad to U.S. parents, while the Hatch one would have allowed those who have been naturalized citizens for twenty years to be eligible.\n\nBut all these proposed articles of amendment have failed in the Congresses, and thus none have ever been submitted to the states for ratification; thus the restriction that the clause imposes remains unrelaxed.\n\nSt. George Tucker, an early federal judge, wrote in his 1803 edition of William Blackstone's \"Commentaries on the Laws of England\", perhaps the leading authority for the delegates to the Constitutional Convention for the terms used in the Constitution, that the natural-born-citizen clause is \"a happy means of security against foreign influence\" and that \"[t]he admission of foreigners into our councils, consequently, cannot be too much guarded against.\" In a footnote, Tucker wrote that naturalized citizens have the same rights as the natural-born except \"they are forever incapable of being chosen to the office of president of the United States.\"\n\nIn a speech before the Senate, delegate Charles Cotesworth Pinckney gave the rationale, \"to insure experience and attachment to the country.\"\n\nProfessor Akhil Amar of Yale Law School claimed that there had been a concern on the part of those drafting the U.S. Constitution that a member of the European aristocracy might immigrate and attempt to buy his way into power and that it made sense in this light to include a provision in the Constitution that would exclude immigrants from the presidency.\n\nBecause of the large number of Framers who went on to serve in Congress, laws passed by the early sessions of Congress have often been looked to as evidence of the Framers' intent. The Naturalization Act of 1790 stated that \"the children of citizens of the United States, that may be born beyond sea, or out of the limits of the United States, shall be considered as natural born citizens: Provided, That the right of citizenship shall not descend to persons whose fathers have never been resident in the United States.\" This act was repealed by the Naturalization Act of 1795, which removed the characterization of such children as \"natural born\", stating that \"the children of citizens of the United States, born out of the limits and jurisdiction of the United States, shall be considered as citizens of the United States\" while retaining the same residency restrictions as the 1790 act.\n\nAlthough eligibility for the Presidency was not an issue in any 19th-century litigation, there have been a few cases that shed light on the definitions of \"natural born\" and \"native born\" citizen. The leading case, \"Lynch v. Clarke\" of 1844, indicated that citizens born \"within the dominions and allegiance of the United States\" are citizens regardless of parental citizenship. This case dealt with a New York law (similar to laws of other states at that time) that only a U.S. citizen could inherit real estate. The plaintiff, Julia Lynch, had been born in New York while her parents, both British, were briefly visiting the U.S., and shortly thereafter all three left for Britain and never returned to the U.S. The New York Chancery Court determined that, under common law and prevailing statutes, she was a U.S. citizen by birth and nothing had deprived her of that citizenship, notwithstanding that both her parents were not U.S. citizens or that British law might also claim her through her parents' nationality. In the course of the decision, the court cited the Constitutional provision and said:\n\nSuppose a person should be elected president who was native born, but of alien parents; could there be any reasonable doubt that he was eligible under the Constitution? I think not. The position would be decisive in his favor, that by the rule of the common law, in force when the Constitution was adopted, he is a citizen.\n\nAnd further:\n\nUpon principle, therefore, I can entertain no doubt, but that by the law of the United States, every person born within the dominions and allegiance of the United States, whatever the situation of his parents, is a natural born citizen. It is surprising that there has been no judicial decision upon this question.\n\nThe decision in \"Lynch\" was cited as persuasive or authoritative precedent in numerous subsequent cases, and reinforced the interpretation that \"natural born citizen\" meant born \"within the dominions and allegiance of the United States\" regardless of parental citizenship. For example, in an 1884 case, \"In re Look Tin Singg\", the federal court held, that despite laws preventing naturalization of Chinese visitors, Chinese persons born in the United States were citizens by birth, and remained such despite any long stay in China. Citing \"Lynch\", Justice Stephen J. Field wrote:\n\nAfter an exhaustive examination of the law, the Vice-Chancellor said that he entertained no doubt that every person born within the dominions and allegiance of the United States, whatever the situation of his parents, was a natural-born citizen, and added that this was the general understanding of the legal profession, and the universal impression of the public mind.\n\nThe \"Lynch\" case was also cited as a leading precedent in the U.S. Supreme Court decision in \"United States v. Wong Kim Ark\" (1898), which similarly held a child born in the United States of two Chinese parents became \"at the time of his birth a citizen of the United States\". Similarly, in a 1999 Circuit Court decision, the U.S.-born children of two non-citizen parents were spoken of as \"natural born citizens\".\n\nHowever, in 1875, Chief Justice Waite, in Minor v. Happersett, stated: \"The Constitution does not, in words, say who shall be natural-born citizens. Resort must be had elsewhere to ascertain that. At common-law, with the nomenclature of which the framers of the Constitution were familiar, it was never doubted that all children born in a country of parents who were its citizens became themselves, upon their birth, citizens also. These were natives, or natural-born citizens,as distinguished from aliens or foreigners. Some authorities go further and include as citizens children born within the jurisdiction without reference to the citizenship of their parents. As to this class there have been doubts, but never as to the first.\"\n\nConsistent with the earlier decisions, in 1939, the U.S. Supreme Court stated in its decision in \"Perkins v. Elg\" that a person born in America and raised in another country was a natural born citizen, and specifically stated that they could \"become President of the United States\". The case was regarding a young woman, born in New York a year after her father became a naturalized U.S. citizen. However, when she was about four her parents returned to Sweden taking her with them, and they stayed in Sweden. At age 20, she contacted the American embassy in Sweden and, shortly after her 21st birthday, returned to the United States on a U.S. passport and was admitted as a U.S. citizen. Years later, while she was still in America, her father in Sweden relinquished his American citizenship, and, because of that, the Department of Labor (then the location of the Immigration & Naturalization Service) declared her a non-citizen and tried to deport her. The young woman filed suit for a declaratory judgment that she was an American citizen by birth. She won at the trial level, and at the circuit court—where she was repeatedly described as \"a natural born citizen\" — and finally in the U.S. Supreme Court, where the court decision quoted at length from the U.S. Attorney General's opinion in \"Steinkauler's Case\" (mentioned in the next section #Government_officials'_interpretations) including the comment that a person born in America and raised in another country could yet \"become President of the United States\".\n\nSome federal cases argued for a narrow reading of the Fourteenth Amendment, according to which U.S. citizens were necessarily either born or naturalized in the United States, and any citizen who was not born in the United States must have been naturalized by operation of law, even if such naturalization was \"automatic\" at birth. In this view, such a person should not be considered a natural born citizen, but rather a \"naturalized\" citizen who is not eligible for the Presidency.\n\nIn 1951, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit noted in \"Zimmer v. Acheson\" that \"[t]here are only two classes of citizens of the United States, native-born citizens and naturalized citizens\", quoting a dictum by Justice Gray from United States v. Wong Kim Ark and Elk v. Wilkins. The court ruled that Zimmer, who was born abroad in 1905 to a U.S. citizen father and a noncitizen mother, was himself a citizen under the nationality law in force at the time of his birth, but \"his status as a citizen was that of a naturalized citizen and not a native-born citizen\". In the 1956 case of \"Wong Kam Wo v. Dulles\", the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit quoted \"Zimmer v. Acheson\" and \"United States v. Wong Kim Ark\" in support of a ruling that the statute that was in effect prior to 1940 granting citizenship to foreign-born children of U.S. citizens was a naturalization law rather than a provision for nationality at birth. In 1940, the Nationality Act of 1940 (), explicitly defined \"naturalization\" as conferring nationality \"after\" birth.\n\nIn 1961, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in \"Montana v. Kennedy\" that an individual who was born in 1906 in Italy to a U.S. citizen mother and a noncitizen father was not a U.S. citizen by birth under the nationality laws in force at the time of his birth. It observed that automatic citizenship was granted to children of U.S. citizen fathers and noncitizen mothers by an 1855 act of Congress, but the reverse situation was only addressed, non-retroactively, in 1934. In 1971, the Court encountered a similar situation in \"Rogers v. Bellei\", where the individual in question was born after 1934 and so was granted automatic U.S. citizenship, though subject to residence requirements and was subject to expatriation. The Court \"appeared to assume or imply that such persons became citizens at birth by way of naturalization\".\n\nMore recent cases, particularly \"Nguyen v. INS\" and \"Robinson v. Bowen\", relaxed this view, suggesting that the Fourteenth Amendment merely establishes a \"floor\" for birthright citizenship, and this category may be expanded by Congress.\n\nIn 2009 in \"Ankeny v. Governor\", the Indiana Court of Appeals reaffirmed that persons born within the borders of the United States are \"natural born Citizens\", regardless of the citizenship of their parents. The court referred to the case of Wong Kim Ark, and provides a compilation of the arguments pertaining to this topic.\n\nA clarification to this interpretation was made in 2010, where a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that natural born citizens can lose their citizenship if their territory of birth later ceases to be U.S. territory. The case involved a Philippine-born litigant who could not claim U.S. citizenship on the basis of his parents, who lived all their lives in the Philippines, because they were born while the Philippines was U.S. territory prior to being given its independence. The Courts for the Second, Third, and Ninth Circuits have also held that birth in the Philippines at a time when the country was a territory of the United States does not constitute birth \"in the United States\" under the Citizenship Clause, and thus did not give rise to United States citizenship.\n\nIn a 2012 New York case, \"Strunk v. N.Y. State Board of Elections\", the \"pro se\" plaintiff challenged Barack Obama's presence on the presidential ballot, based on his own interpretation that \"natural born citizen\" required the president \"to have been born on United States soil \"and\" have \"two\" United States \"born\" parents\" (emphasis added). To this the Court responded, \"Article II, section 1, clause 5 does not state this. No legal authority has ever stated that the Natural Born Citizen clause means what plaintiff Strunk claims it says. ... Moreover, President Obama is the sixth U.S. President to have had one or both of his parents not born on U.S. soil\". The opinion then listed Andrew Jackson, James Buchanan, Chester A. Arthur, Woodrow Wilson, and Herbert Hoover.\n\nJohn Bingham, an American lawyer and politician, held to the belief that natural born should be interpreted as born in the United States. In 1862, in the House of Representatives he stated:\nThe Constitution leaves no room for doubt upon this subject. The words \"natural born citizen of the United States\" appear in it, and the other provision appears in it that, \"Congress shall have power to pass a uniform system of naturalization.\" To naturalize a person is to admit him to citizenship. Who are \"natural born citizens\" but those born within the Republic? Those born within the Republic, whether black or white, are citizens by birth—natural born citizens.\n\nHe reiterated his statement in 1866:\nEvery human being born within the jurisdiction of the United States of parents not owing allegiance to any foreign sovereignty is, in the language of your Constitution itself, a natural-born citizen; but, sir, I may be allowed to say further that I deny that the Congress of the United States ever had the power, or color of power to say that any man born within the jurisdiction of the United States, not owing a foreign allegiance, is not and shall not be a citizen of the United States. Citizenship is his birthright and neither the Congress nor the States can justly or lawfully take it from him.\n\nEdward Bates also held to the belief that \"natural born\" should be interpreted as \"born in the United States\". He also indicated that those born in the United States to alien parents, even if they reside elsewhere, are still considered natural born. In 1862, Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase sent a query to Attorney General Edward Bates asking whether or not \"colored men\" can be citizens of the United States. The question arose because the Coast Guard had detained a schooner commanded by a free \"colored man\" who claimed he was a citizen of the United States. If he were a U.S. citizen the boat could be released, but otherwise—the Civil War then being fought—it would be confiscated. No information about the man's birth or parentage was provided. Bates responded on November 29, 1862, with a 27-page opinion — considered of such importance that the government published it not only in the official volumes of Attorney-General opinions but also as a separate booklet — concluding,\n\nIn the course of that opinion, Bates commented at some length on the nature of citizenship, and wrote,\n\n... our constitution, in speaking of \"natural born citizens\", uses no affirmative language to make them such, but only recognizes and reaffirms the universal principle, common to all nations, and as old as political society, that the people born in a country do constitute the nation, and, as individuals, are \"natural\" members of the body politic. [italics in original]\n\nIn another opinion, dated September 1, 1862, Bates dealt with a question from the Secretary of State, of whether a person born in the U.S. to two non-citizens, who is taken with them back to their country, could, years later, re-enter the United States as of right, as a U.S. citizen. Bates wrote:\n\nI am quite clear in the opinion that children born in the United States of alien parents, who have never been naturalized, are native-born citizens of the United States, and, of course, do not require the formality of naturalization to entitle them to the rights and privileges of such citizenship. I might sustain this opinion by a reference to the well-settled principle of the common law of England on this subject; to the writings of many of the earlier and later commentators on our Constitution and laws; ... and lastly to the dicta and decisions of many of our national and state tribunals. But all this has been well done by Assistant Vice Chancellor Sandford, in the case of \"Lynch vs. Clarke\", and I forbear. I refer to his opinion for a full and clear statement of the principle, and of the reasons and authorities for its support. \n\nUnlike Edward Bates, U.S. Secretary of State William Learned Marcy was equivocal about whether those born in the country of alien parents and who reside elsewhere are still considered citizens. In 1854 Marcy wrote John Y. Mason, the U.S. Minister to France:\n\nIn reply to the inquiry ... whether \"the children of foreign parents \"born in the United States\", but brought to the country of which the father is a subject, and continuing to reside within the jurisdiction of their father's country, are entitled to protection as citizens of the United States\", I have to observe that it is presumed that, according to the common law, any person born in the United States, unless he be born in one of the foreign legations therein, may be considered a citizen thereof until he formally renounces his citizenship. There is not, however any United States statute containing a provision upon this subject, nor, so far as I am aware, has there been any judicial decision in regard to it.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Edwards Pierrepont, however, shared Edward Bates' opinion that those born in the country of alien parents and who reside elsewhere are still considered citizens, and he added that they should be entitled to be president of the United States, if elected. In 1875 Pierrepont was presented with a query from the Secretary of State, Hamilton Fish. A young man, named Arthur Steinkauler, had been born in Missouri in 1855, a year after his father was naturalized a U.S. citizen. When he was four years old, his father returned to Germany with him and both had stayed there ever since. The father had relinquished his U.S. citizenship and the young man was now 20 years old and about to be drafted into the Imperial German army. The question was asked \"What was this young man's situation as a native-born American citizen?\" After studying the relevant legal authorities, Pierrepont wrote:\n\nUnder the treaty [of 1868 with Germany], and in harmony with American doctrine, it is clear that Steinkauler the father abandoned his naturalization in America and became a German subject (his son being yet a minor), and that by virtue of German laws the son acquired German nationality. It is equally clear that the son, by birth, has American nationality, and hence he has two nationalities, one natural, the other acquired ... Young Steinkauler is a native-born American citizen. There is no law of the United States under which his father or any other person can deprive him of his birthright. He can return to America at the age of 21, and in due time, if the people elect, he can become President of the United States. ... I am of opinion that when he reaches the age of 21 years he can then elect whether he will return and take the nationality of his birth, with its duties and privileges, or retain the nationality acquired by the act of his father.\n\nFrederick van Dyne, the Assistant Solicitor of the U.S. Department of State (1900–1907) indicated that children of citizens born outside the United States are also considered citizens. In 1904, he published a textbook, \"Citizenship of the United States\", in which he wrote:\n\nThere is no uniform rule of international law covering the subject of citizenship. Every nation determines for itself who shall, and who shall not, be its citizens. ... By the law of the United States, citizenship depends, generally, on the place of birth; nevertheless the children of citizens, born out of the jurisdiction of the United States, are also citizens. ... The Constitution of the United States, while it recognized citizenship of the United States in prescribing the qualifications of the President, Senators, and Representatives, contained no definition of citizenship until the adoption of the 14th Amendment, in 1868; nor did Congress attempt to define it until the passage of the civil rights act, in 1866. ... Prior to this time the subject of citizenship by birth was generally held to be regulated by the common law, by which all persons born within the limits and allegiance of the United States were deemed natural-born citizens.\n\nIt appears to have been assumed by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of \"Murray v. The Charming Betsy\" (1804) 2 Cranch (6 U.S.) 64, 119, 2 L.Ed. 208, 226, that all persons born in the United States were citizens thereof. ... In \"M'Creery v. Somerville\" (1824) 9 Wheat. (22 U.S.) 354, 6 L.Ed. 109, which concerned the title to land in the state of Maryland, it was assumed that children born in that state to an alien were native-born citizens of the United States. ... The Federal courts have almost uniformly held that birth in the United States, of itself, confers citizenship.\n\nWilliam Rawle, formerly the U.S. Attorney for Pennsylvania (1791–1799) defined \"natural born citizen\" as every person born within the United States, regardless of the citizenship of their parents. In an 1825 treatise, \"A View of the Constitution of the United States of America\", he wrote:\n\nThe citizens of each state constituted the citizens of the United States when the Constitution was adopted. ... [He] who was subsequently born the citizen of a State, became at the moment of his birth a citizen of the United States. Therefore every person born within the United States, its territories or districts, whether the parents are citizens or aliens, is a natural born citizen in the sense of the Constitution, and entitled to all the rights and privileges appertaining to that capacity. ... Under our Constitution the question is settled by its express language, and when we are informed ... no person is eligible to the office of President unless he is a natural born citizen, the principle that the place of birth creates the relative quality is established as to us.\n\nJames F. Wilson agreed with Rawle's opinion, but added the exclusion of visiting foreign diplomats. During an 1866 House debate, he quoted Rawle's opinion, and also referred to the \"general law relating to subjects and citizens recognized by all nations\", saying:\n\n... and that must lead us to the conclusion that every person born in the United States is a natural-born citizen of such States, except it may be that children born on our soil to temporary sojourners or representatives of foreign Governments, are native-born citizens of the United States.\n\nSupreme Court Justice Peter Vivian Daniel disagreed with this position and considered \"natural born citizen\" as every person born of citizen parents within the United States. In 1857, in a concurring opinion in \"Dred Scott v. Sandford\", he quoted an English-language translation of Emerich de Vattel's 1758 treatise \"The Law of Nations\" (\"Le Droit des gens\"), stating that \"The natives, or natural-born citizens, are those born in the country of parents who are citizens\".\n\nThis was quoted again in 1898 by Chief Justice Melville Fuller in his dissenting opinion in \"United States v. Wong Kim Ark\". However, two paragraphs later, Justice Vattel disagrees and states, \"§ 214. ... there are states, as, for instance, England, where the single circumstance of being born in the country naturalizes the children of a foreigner.\"\n\nJoseph Story, an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, believed that the term \"native citizen\" is synonymous with natural born citizen, though he does not define either term. In his 1840 guidebook to the Constitution, \"A Familiar Exposition of the Constitution of the United States\", about the natural-born-citizen clause he wrote \"It is not too much to say that no one, but a native citizen, ought ordinarily to be [e]ntrusted with an office so vital to the safety and liberties of the people.\" This same wording also appeared in his 1834 work \"The constitutional class book: being a brief exposition of the Constitution of the United States: Designed for the use of the higher classes in common schools\".\n\nAlexander Porter Morse, the lawyer who represented Louisiana in \"Plessy v. Ferguson\", considered this connection between \"native born\" and \"natural born\" to signify that only a child of citizens should be allowed to run for President. In the \"Albany Law Journal\", he wrote:\n\nIf it was intended that anybody who was a citizen by birth should be eligible, it would only have been necessary to say, \"no person, except a native-born citizen\"; but the framers thought it wise, in view of the probable influx of European immigration, to provide that the president should at least be the child of citizens owing allegiance to the United States at the time of his birth. It may be observed in passing that the current phrase \"native-born citizen\" is well understood; but it is pleonasm and should be discarded; and the correct designation, \"native citizen\" should be substituted in all constitutional and statutory enactments, in judicial decisions and in legal discussions where accuracy and precise language are essential to intelligent discussion.\n\n\"Black's Law Dictionary\" (9th Edition) defines \"Natural Born Citizen\" as \"A person born within the jurisdiction of a national government\".\n\nIn 2000, the Congressional Research Service (CRS), in one of its reports, wrote that most constitutional scholars interpret the natural-born-citizen clause to include citizens born outside the United States to parents who are U.S. citizens. This same CRS report also asserts that citizens born in the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, are legally defined as \"natural born\" citizens and are, therefore, also eligible to be elected president.\n\nThis opinion was reaffirmed in a 2009 CRS report, which stated:\nConsidering the history of the constitutional qualifications provision, the common use and meaning of the phrase \"natural-born subject\" in England and in the Colonies in the 1700s, the clause's apparent intent, the subsequent action of the first Congress in enacting the Naturalization Act of 1790 (expressly defining the term \"natural born citizen\" to include a person born abroad to parents who are United States citizens), as well as subsequent Supreme Court dicta, it appears that the most logical inferences would indicate that the phrase \"natural born Citizen\" would mean a person who is entitled to U.S. citizenship \"at birth\" or \"by birth\".\n\nThe interpretation of natural born being the equivalent of a citizen at birth was repeated in a 2011 CRS report and a 2016 CRS report. The 2011 report stated:\nThe weight of legal and historical authority indicates that the term \"natural born\" citizen would mean a person who is entitled to U.S. citizenship \"by birth\" or \"at birth,\" either by being born \"in\" the United States and under its jurisdiction, even those born to alien parents; by being born abroad to U.S. citizen-parents; or by being born in other situations meeting legal requirements for U.S. citizenship \"at birth\". Such term, however, would not include a person who was not a U.S. citizen by birth or at birth, and who was thus born an \"alien\" required to go through the legal process of \"naturalization\" to become a U.S. citizen.\n\nThe 2016 report similarly stated:\nAlthough the eligibility of U.S. born citizens has been settled law for more than a century, there have been legitimate legal issues raised concerning those born \"outside\" of the country to U.S. citizens. From historical material and case law, it appears that the common understanding of the term \"natural born\" in England and in the American colonies in the 1700s included both the strict common law meaning as born in the territory (\"jus soli\"), as well as the \"statutory\" laws adopted in England since at least 1350, which included children born abroad to British fathers (\"jus sanguinis\", the law of descent). Legal scholars in the field of citizenship have asserted that this common understanding and legal meaning in England and in the American colonies was incorporated into the usage and intent of the term in the U.S. Constitution to include those who are citizens at birth.\n\nGabriel J. Chin, Professor of Law at UC Davis School of Law, held the opinion that the term \"natural born\" is ambiguous and citizenship-granting authority has changed over the years. He notes that persons born outside the United States to U.S.-citizen parents have not always been born citizens. For example, foreign-born children of persons who became citizens between April 14, 1802 and 1854 were aliens. He also believed that children born in the Panama Canal Zone to at least one U.S. then-citizen before August 4, 1937, when Congress granted citizenship to all such persons, were born without American citizenship. \nIn 2009, G. Edward \"Ted\" White, Professor of Law at the University of Virginia, stated the term refers to anyone born on U.S. soil \"or\" anyone born on foreign soil to American citizen parents.\n\nUnlike Chin and White, Mary McManamon, Professor of Law at Widener University School of Law, has argued in the \"Catholic University Law Review\" that, aside from children born to foreign ambassadors or to hostile soldiers on U.S. territory, both of whom owe allegiance to a different sovereign, a natural born citizen must be born in the United States. She claims that common law provides an exception for the children of U.S. ambassadors born abroad and the children of American soldiers while engaged in hostilities. Thus, with these two limited exceptions, she equates \"natural born\" with \"native born\".\n\nProfessor Einer Elhauge of Harvard Law School agrees with Professor McManamon that \"natural born\" means \"native born\" and therefore the wording of the Constitution \"does not permit his candidacy,\" referring to a candidate who was born in Canada to one U.S. citizen parent. Professor Robert Clinton at the Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law at Arizona State University is also of the opinion that \"natural born citizen\" means \"born in the United States.\" University of Chicago Professor Eric Posner also concludes that \"natural born citizen\" means a \"person born in the (United States)\". Former Chief Justice of the New York Court of Appeals, Sol Wachtler, concludes the same. Their conclusion is consistent with the position that the eighteenth century legal usage of the term \"shall be considered as natural born\" in the Naturalization Act of 1790 merely naturalized persons or granted them limited rights of the natural born.\n\nThere is consensus among academics that those born on American soil, except children born to foreign ambassadors or to hostile soldiers on U.S. territory, both of whom owe allegiance to a different sovereign, are natural born citizens, or \"jus soli\", regardless of parental citizenship status.\n\nIn a 2008 article published by the \"Michigan Law Review\", Lawrence Solum, Professor of Law at the University of Illinois, stated that \"there is general agreement on the core of [the] meaning [of the Presidential Eligibility Clause]. Anyone born on American soil whose parents are citizens of the United States is a 'natural born citizen. In April 2010, Solum republished the same article as an online draft, in which he clarified his original statement so that it would not be misunderstood as excluding the children of one citizen parent. In a footnote he explained, \"based on my reading of the historical sources, there is no credible case that a person born on American soil with one American parent was clearly not a 'natural born citizen'.\" He further extended natural born citizenship to all cases of \"jus soli\" as the \"conventional view\". Although Solum stated elsewhere that the two-citizen-parents arguments were not \"crazy\", he believes \"the much stronger argument suggests that if you were born on American soil that you would be considered a natural born citizen.\"\n\nRonald Rotunda, Professor of Law at Chapman University, has remarked \"There's [\"sic\"] some people who say that both parents need to be citizens. That's never been the law.\"\n\nPolly Price, Professor of Law at Emory University, has commented \"It's a little confusing, but most scholars think it's a pretty unusual position for anyone to think the natural born citizen clause would exclude someone born in the U.S.\"\n\nChin concurred with that assessment, stating, \"there is agreement that 'natural born citizens' include those made citizens by birth under the 14th Amendment.\"\n\nSimilarly, Eugene Volokh, Professor of Law at UCLA, found \"quite persuasive\" the reasoning employed by the Indiana Court of Appeals, which had concluded \"that persons born within the borders of the United States are 'natural born Citizens' for Article II, Section 1 purposes, regardless of the citizenship of their parents\".\n\nDaniel Tokaji, Professor of Law at Ohio State University, agrees the citizenship status of a U.S.-born candidate's parents is irrelevant.\n\nIn a 2006 John Marshall Law Review article, Paul A. Clark argues that the Fifth Amendment should be read as implicitly repealing the requirement that the U.S. President needs to be a natural-born U.S. citizen. Clark points out that, starting from the 1954 case Bolling v. Sharpe, courts have held that the Fifth Amendment contains an implicit equal protection clause whose scope is identical to the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause and that federal discrimination against naturalized U.S. citizens (or, more specifically, federal discrimination based on national origin) would be struck down by the courts as being in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Since the requirement that the U.S. President needs to be a natural-born U.S. citizen is a form of discrimination based on national origin, Clark argues that the courts should strike down this requirement.\n\nSo far, Clark's argument in regards to this has not attracted wide support among the U.S. legal academy (though Professor Josh Blackman asked a question about a similar topic in 2015--specifically about the Fourteenth Amendment nullifying the natural-born citizen clause).\n\nSeveral courts have ruled that private citizens do not have standing to challenge the eligibility of candidates to appear on a presidential election ballot. Alternatively, there is a statutory method by which the eligibility of the president-elect of the United States to take office may be challenged in Congress. Some legal scholars assert that, even if eligibility challenges are nonjusticiable in federal courts, and are not undertaken in Congress, there are other avenues for adjudication, such as an action in state court in regard to ballot access.\n\nEvery president to date was either a citizen at the adoption of the Constitution in 1789 or born in the United States; of the former group, all except one had two parents with citizenship in what would become the U.S. (Andrew Jackson). Of those in the latter group, every president except two (Chester A. Arthur and Barack Obama) had two U.S.-citizen parents. Further, four additional U.S. Presidents had one or both of his U.S.-citizen parents not born on U.S. soil (James Buchanan, Woodrow Wilson, Herbert Hoover and Donald Trump).\n\nSome presidential candidates were not born in a U.S. state or lacked two U.S.-citizen parents. In addition, one U.S. vice president (Al Gore) was born in Washington, D.C., and another (Charles Curtis) was born in the Kansas Territory. This does not necessarily mean that these officeholders or candidates were ineligible, only that there was some controversy about their eligibility, which may have been resolved in favor of eligibility.\n\nChester A. Arthur, who was sworn in as president when James A. Garfield died after being shot, was rumored to have been born in Canada.\n\nChester A. Arthur was born in Vermont on October 5, 1829 to a Vermont-born mother and a father from Ireland (who later became a U.S. citizen, 14 years after Chester A. Arthur was born). His mother, Malvina Stone Arthur, was a native of Berkshire, Vermont, who moved with her family to Quebec, where she met and married the future president's father, William Arthur, on April 12, 1821. After the family had settled in Fairfield, Vermont, somewhere between 1822 and 1824, William Arthur traveled with his eldest daughter to East Stanbridge, Canada, in October 1830 and commuted to Fairfield on Sundays to preach. \"It appears that he traveled regularly between the two villages, both of which were close to the Canada–US border, for about eighteen months, holding two jobs\", which may well explain the confusion about Chester A. Arthur's place of birth, as perhaps did the fact that he was born in Franklin County, and thus within a day's walk of the Vermont–Quebec border. Moreover, Chester A. Arthur himself added a bit of confusion into the record by sometimes reporting his birth year as 1830.\n\nNo evidence of his having been born in Canada was ever demonstrated by his Democratic opponents, although Arthur Hinman, an attorney who had investigated Chester A. Arthur's family history, raised the allegation as an objection during his vice-presidential campaign and, after the end of his presidency, published a book on the subject.\n\nChristopher Schürmann (born in New York City) entered the Labor primaries during the 1896 presidential election. His eligibility was questioned in a \"New York Tribune\" article, because he was born to parents of German nationality. It was stated that \"various Attorney-Generals [\"sic\"] of the United States have expressed the opinion that a child born in this country of alien parents, who have not been naturalized, is, by the fact of birth, a native-born citizen entitled to all rights and privileges as such.\" But due to a lack of any statute on the subject, Schürmann's eligibility was \"at best an open question, and one which should have made [his] nomination under any circumstances an impossibility\", because questions concerning his eligibility could have been raised after the election.\n\nThe eligibility of Charles Evans Hughes was questioned in an article written by Breckinridge Long, one of Woodrow Wilson's campaign workers, and published on December 7, 1916 in the \"Chicago Legal News\" — a full month \"after\" the U.S. presidential election of 1916, in which Hughes was narrowly defeated by Woodrow Wilson. Long claimed that Hughes was ineligible because his father was not yet naturalized at the time of his birth and was still a British citizen (in fact, both his parents were British citizens and never became U.S. citizens). Observing that Hughes, although born in the United States, was also (according to British law) a British subject and therefore \"enjoy[ed] a dual nationality and owe[d] a double allegiance\", Long argued that a \"native born\" citizen was not \"natural born\" without a unity of U.S. citizenship and allegiance and stated: \"Now if, by any possible construction, a person at the instant of birth, and for any period of time thereafter, owes, or may owe, allegiance to any sovereign but the United States, he is not a 'natural-born' citizen of the United States.\" \n\nBarry Goldwater was born in Phoenix, in what was then the incorporated Arizona Territory of the United States. During his presidential campaign in 1964, there was a minor controversy over Goldwater's having been born in Arizona three years before it became a state.\n\nGeorge W. Romney, who ran for the Republican party presidential nomination in 1968, was born in Mexico to U.S. parents. Romney's grandfather, a member of the LDS Church, had emigrated to Mexico in 1886 with his three wives and their children, after the U.S. federal government outlawed polygamy. However Romney's parents (monogamous under new church doctrine) retained their U.S. citizenship and returned to the United States with him and his siblings in 1912. Romney's eligibility for President became moot when Richard Nixon was nominated as the Republican presidential candidate.\n\nLowell P. Weicker entered the race for the Republican party nomination of 1980 but dropped out before voting in the primaries began; he was also suggested as a possible vice-presidential nominee in 1976, to replace retiring Vice President Nelson Rockefeller under the Republican ticket of incumbent President Gerald Ford. However Senator Bob Dole from Kansas was later chosen as the nominee. He was born in Paris, France, to parents who were U.S. citizens. His father was an executive for E. R. Squibb & Sons and his mother was born in India, the daughter of a British general.\n\nJohn McCain was born in 1936 at Coco Solo, Naval Air Station in the Panama Canal Zone. McCain's eligibility was not challenged during his 2000 campaign, but it was challenged during his 2008 campaign.\n\nMcCain never released his birth certificate to the press or independent fact-checking organizations, but in 2008 one was shown to \"Washington Post\" reporter Michael Dobbs, who wrote, \"[A] senior official of the McCain campaign showed me a copy of [McCain's] birth certificate issued by the 'family hospital' in the Coco Solo submarine base.\" A lawsuit filed by Fred Hollander in 2008 alleged McCain was actually born in a civilian hospital in Colón, Panama. Dobbs wrote that in his autobiography, \"Faith of My Fathers\", McCain wrote that he was born \"in the Canal Zone\" at the U.S. Naval Air Station in Coco Solo, which was under the command of his grandfather, John S. McCain Sr. \"The senator's father, John S. McCain Jr., was an executive officer on a submarine, also based in Coco Solo. His mother, Roberta McCain, has said that she has vivid memories of lying in bed listening to raucous celebrations of her son's birth from the nearby officers' club. The birth was announced days later in the English-language Panamanian American newspaper.\"\n\nThe former unincorporated territory of the Panama Canal Zone and its related military facilities were not regarded as United States territory at the time, but , which became law in 1937, retroactively conferred citizenship on individuals born within the Canal Zone on or after February 26, 1904, and on individuals born in the Republic of Panama on or after that date who had at least one U.S. citizen parent employed by the U.S. government or the Panama Railway Company; was cited in Judge William Alsup's 2008 ruling, described below. A March 2008 paper by former Solicitor General Ted Olson and Harvard Law Professor Laurence H. Tribe opined that McCain was eligible for the Presidency. In April 2008, the U.S. Senate approved a non-binding resolution recognizing McCain's status as a natural-born citizen. In September 2008, U.S. District Judge William Alsup stated \"obiter\" in his ruling that it is \"highly probable\" that McCain is a natural-born citizen from birth by virtue of , although he acknowledged the alternative possibility that McCain became a natural-born citizen retroactively, by way of .\n\nThese views have been criticized by Chin, who argues that McCain was at birth a citizen of Panama and was only retroactively declared a born citizen under , because at the time of his birth and with regard to the Canal Zone the Supreme Court's Insular Cases overruled the Naturalization Act of 1795, which would otherwise have declared McCain a U.S. citizen immediately at birth. The U.S. State Department's \"Foreign Affairs Manual\" states that children born in the Panama Canal Zone at certain times became U.S. nationals without citizenship. In \"Rogers v. Bellei\", the Supreme Court ruled that children \"born abroad of American parents\" are not citizens within the citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment but did not elaborate on their \"natural-born\" status. Similarly, legal scholar Lawrence Solum concluded in an article on the \"natural born citizen\" clause that the question of McCain's eligibility could not be answered with certainty, and that it would depend on the particular approach of \"constitutional construction\". The urban legend fact checking website Snopes.com considers McCain's eligibility \"undetermined\".\n\nArguments over McCain's eligibility became moot after he lost the United States presidential election in 2008.\n\nBarack Obama was born in 1961 in Honolulu, Hawaii (which had become a U.S. state in 1959). His mother was a U.S. citizen and his father was a British subject from British Kenya.\n\nBefore and after the 2008 presidential election, arguments were made that Obama was not a natural-born citizen. On June 12, 2008, the Obama presidential campaign launched a website to counter what it described as a smear campaign by his opponents, including conspiracy theories challenging his eligibility. The most prominent issue raised against Obama was the claim made in several lawsuits that he was not actually born in Hawaii. The Supreme Court declined without comment to hear two lawsuits in which the plaintiffs argued it was irrelevant whether Obama was born in Hawaii. Most of the cases were dismissed because of the plaintiff's lack of standing; however, several courts have given guidance on the question.\n\nIn \"Ankeny v. Governor\", a three-member Indiana Court of Appeals stated,\nBased upon the language of Article II, Section 1, Clause 4 and the guidance provided by \"Wong Kim Ark\", we conclude that persons born within the borders of the United States are 'natural born Citizens' for Article II, Section 1 purposes, regardless of the citizenship of their parents.\n\nAdministrative Law Judge Michael Malihi in Georgia decided a group of eligibility challenge cases by saying, \"The Indiana Court rejected the argument that Mr. Obama was ineligible, stating that the children born within the United States are natural born citizens, regardless of the citizenship of their parents. ... This Court finds the decision and analysis of \"Ankeny\" persuasive.\" Federal District Judge John A. Gibney, Jr. wrote in his decision in the case of \"Tisdale v. Obama\":\n\nThe eligibility requirements to be President of the United States are such that the individual must be a \"natural born citizen\" of the United States ... It is well settled that those born in the United States are considered natural born citizens. See, e.g. \"United States v. Ark\" [sic] ...\n\nOn October 31, 2008, Hawaii Health Director Chiyome Fukino issued a statement saying,\n\nI ... have personally seen and verified that the Hawai'i State Department of Health has Sen. Obama's original birth certificate on record in accordance with state policies and procedures.\n\nOn July 27, 2009, Fukino issued an additional statement:\nI ... have seen the original vital records maintained on file by the Hawaii State Department of Health verifying Barack Hussein Obama was born in Hawaii and is a natural-born American citizen.\n\nAttempts to prevent Obama from participating in the 2012 Democratic primary election in several states failed.\n\nTed Cruz announced on March 22, 2015, that he was running for the Republican Party's nomination for president in the 2016 election. Cruz was born in Calgary, Canada. Cruz's mother was a U.S. citizen and his father was born in Cuba, but his father eventually became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2005. This gave Cruz dual Canadian-American citizenship, as he was granted U.S. citizenship at the time of his birth by the virtue of his mother's citizenship, and Canada grants birthright citizenship to every person born in Canada. Cruz applied to formally renounce his Canadian citizenship and ceased being a citizen of Canada on May 14, 2014.\n\nFormer Solicitor General Paul Clement, former Acting Solicitor General Neal Katyal, University of California, Irvine School of Law Dean Erwin Chemerinsky, Professor Chin (see above), Temple University Law School Professor Peter Spiro, Professor Akhil Amar, Georgetown University Law Center Professor Randy Barnett, Yale Law School Professor Jack Balkin, and University of San Diego Professor Michael Ramsey believe Cruz meets the constitutional requirements to be eligible for the presidency. Similarly, Bryan Garner, the editor of Black's Law Dictionary, believes the U.S. Supreme Court would find Cruz to be eligible, and Case Western Reserve University School of Law professor Jonathan H. Adler agrees that no court will rule against Cruz's eligibility.\n\nLaurence Tribe of Harvard, however, described Cruz's eligibility as \"murky and unsettled\". Harvard Law Professor Cass Sunstein believes that Cruz is eligible, but agrees with Ramsey that Cruz's eligibility is not \"an easy question\". Sunstein believes concerns over standing and the political-question doctrine make it unlikely that courts would rule against Cruz.\n\nMary McManamon (see above) writing in the \"Catholic University Law Review\" believes that Cruz is not eligible because he was not born in the United States. Professor Einer Elhauge of Harvard, Professor Robert Clinton of Arizona State University, University of Chicago Professor Eric Posner, former Chief Justice of the New York Court of Appeals Sol Wachtler, and Professor Victor Williams of Catholic University of America's law school agree that Cruz is not eligible. Alan Grayson, a Democratic Member of Congress from Florida, does not believe Cruz is a natural-born citizen, and stated he would have filed a lawsuit if Cruz had become the Republican nominee. Orly Taitz, Larry Klayman, and Mario Apuzzo, who each filed multiple lawsuits challenging Obama's eligibility, have also asserted that Cruz is not eligible.\n\nCruz's eligibility was questioned by some of his primary opponents, including Donald Trump, Mike Huckabee, Rick Santorum, Carly Fiorina, and Rand Paul. Marco Rubio, however, believes Cruz is eligible.\n\nTwo November 2015 ballot challenges in New Hampshire alleging that Cruz was not a natural-born citizen were unsuccessful. In December, a similar lawsuit was filed in Vermont, and an unsuccessful lawsuit was filed in Florida. In January 2016, similar lawsuits were unsuccessfully filed in Texas and Utah, and two similar unsuccessful ballot challenges were filed in Illinois. In February, two similar unsuccessful lawsuits were filed in Pennsylvania and one was filed in Arkansas; a similar lawsuit was filed in Alabama; similar unsuccessful ballot challenges were filed in Indiana; and similar ballot challenges and an unsuccessful similar lawsuit were also filed in New York. In March, a similar lawsuit was filed in New York. In April, a similar ballot challenge was unsuccessfully filed in New Jersey.\n\nNo lawsuit or challenge has been successful, and in February 2016, the Illinois Board of Elections ruled in Cruz's favor, stating, \"The candidate is a natural born citizen by virtue of being born in Canada to his mother who was a U.S. citizen at the time of his birth.\"\n\nThe question of Cruz's eligibility became moot when he suspended his campaign on May 3, 2016.\n\nMarco Rubio and Bobby Jindal both announced in 2015 that they were running for the Republican Party's nomination for president in the 2016 election. Taitz and Apuzzo each have claimed neither Rubio nor Jindal is eligible because both were born (albeit in the United States) to parents who were not U.S. citizens at the time of their respective births.\n\nThe question of Jindal's eligibility became moot when he suspended his presidential campaign in November 2015. Nonetheless, a lawsuit filed in December 2015 in Vermont and a ballot challenge filed in February 2016 in New York challenged Jindal's eligibility.\n\nA November 2015 ballot challenge in New Hampshire alleging that Rubio was not a natural-born citizen was unsuccessful. In December, a similar lawsuit was filed in Vermont, and an unsuccessful lawsuit was filed in Florida. In January 2016, a similar unsuccessful ballot challenge was filed in Illinois. In February, a similar unsuccessful lawsuit was filed in Arkansas; a similar ballot challenge was filed in New York; and an unsuccessful ballot challenge was filed in Indiana.\n\nThe question of Rubio's eligibility became moot when he suspended his presidential campaign in March 2016.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger was reported as considering challenging the prevailing interpretation of the clause. In 2003, Senator Orrin Hatch unsuccessfully put forth the Equal Opportunity to Govern Amendment, intending to allow eligibility for Arnold Schwarzenegger. In October 2013, the \"New York Post\" reported that Schwarzenegger—who is originally from Austria and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1983, also retaining Austrian citizenship—was exploring a future run for the American presidency. He reportedly lobbied legislators about a possible constitutional change, or filing a legal challenge to the provision. Cornell University law professor Michael C. Dorf observed that Schwarzenegger's possible lawsuit could ultimately win him the right to run for the office, noting, \"The law is very clear, but it’s not 100 percent clear that the courts would enforce that law rather than leave it to the political process\". Schwarzenegger subsequently denied that he was running.\n\n\n"}

The area included a couple of villages around Junik and the Highlands of Djakovica along the Kosovo border with Albania (back then part of the Prefecture of Kosovo). The zone consisted of the villages Junik, Mulliq/Molić, Batushë/Batusa, Brovinë/Brovina, Ponoshec/Ponosevac, Babaj i Bokës/Babaj Boks, Popoc/Popovc, Shishman/Šišman, and Koshare/Košare. Beside Junik, the rest correspond today to border villages of the District of Gjakova. \n\nThe area was practically autonomous, ruled by local bayraktars and the Kanun only.\n<br>Despite the intention, the area served as a buffer zone for the kachak guerrillas and was a starting point for consecutive Albanian rebellions organized from 1921 to 1924 in Kosovo. Many \"chetas\" settled around Junik and launched offensives against the Serbian armies starting from there. Azem Galica and his man settled there, and a little later even Hasan Prishtina joined. Beside attacks on the Serbian army, the Committee for the National Defence of Kosovo organized insurgencies against the Zog-controlled governments of Tirana, the latest being a sworn enemy of the Committee of Kosovo and Kosovar irredentists. The Committee of Kosovo leaders as Hasan Prishtina, Bajram and Hysni Curri, and Azem Galica initiated more than once attacks against the Albanian armies and authorities stationed nearby. Two main ones were the Albanian Rebellion of 1922, and the other tentative in January 1923. During the last attempt, Beqir Vokshi, a former member of the Committee who was recently enlisted as an officer of the Albanian army got killed by Galica's men. Vokshi was trying to persuade the Junik population not to support the recent guerrillas attacks upon the Krumë and Tropojë regions.\n\nIn early January 1923, the rebels had taken an offensive over Tropojë, followed by a broader one on Has District. They had surrounded Krumë (center of the Prefecture of Kosovo), attacked the gendarme stations in Nikaj-Mërtur and arrived by the Drin river. The most severe fighting took place near Krumë town, which was attacked from two sides by the guerrillas of Azem Galica and Sadik Rama.\n<br>Following the events, Ahmet Zogu ordered a major offensive. After pushing the insurgents back to the Neutral Zone, in late January 1923 the Albanian army entered Junik. The Kachaks left the area and went inside Kosovo. Later, the area was handed over to the Yugoslavs, and a joint-border patrolling was established. The Yugoslav army burned down the houses which had served as kachak basis and executed around 60 people.By February 1923, the Neutral Zone stopped existing.\n"}

It is a major case dealing with the separation of powers in Australian law.\n\nThe High Court had consistently held that the judicial power of the Commonwealth could not be exercised by any body except a court established under Chapter III of the Constitution or a state court invested with federal jurisdiction. This was because the separation of judicial and other powers was a fundamental principle of the Constitution.\n\nThe High Court had held that the separation of powers did not prevent a Federal court or Federal judge from discharging other functions. Latham CJ stated that:\nThus, in my opinion, it is not possible to rely upon any doctrine of absolute separation of powers for the purpose of establishing a universal proposition that no court or person who discharges Federal judicial functions can lawfully discharge any other function which has been entrusted to him by statute. This proposition, however, does not involve the further proposition that any powers or duties, of any description whatsoever, may be conferred or imposed upon Federal courts or Federal judges. If a power or duty were in its nature such as to be inconsistent with the co-existence of judicial power, it might well be held that a statutory provision purporting to confer or impose such a power or duty could not stand with the creation of the judicial tribunal or the appointment of a person to act as a member of it.\n\nThe power of the Arbitration Court was contained in the \"Conciliation and Arbitration Act\" 1904 which relevantly provided that:\n29. The Court shall have power-\n(b) to order compliance with an order or award proved to the satisfaction of the Court to have been broken or not observed\n(c) by order, to enjoin an organization or person from committing or continuing a contravention of this Act or a breach or non-observance of an order or award;\n29A (1) The Court has the same power to punish contempts of its power and authority, whether in relation to its judicial powers and functions or otherwise, as is possessed by the High Court in respect of contempts of the High Court.\n\nThe Metal Trades Award was made by a conciliation commissioner on 16 January 1952 and included a prohibition on industrial action as follows:\n(ii) An organization shall be deemed to commit a new and separate breach of the above sub-clause on each and every day in which it is directly or indirectly a party to such ban, limitation or restriction.\n\nMembers of the Federated Ironworkers Association (FIA) at the Morts Dock at Balmain, including FIA delegate Nick Origlass, went on strike from 16 February 1955 seeking an increase in pay of A£1 per week. Other workers were supporting the strikers by paying a levy of 8 shillings per week. The strike was portrayed by the Communist Party of Australia, as a contest between the union members and the National Secretary of the , Laurie Short, who was a grouper, part of the informal Industrial Groups set up by the Labor Party within trade unions to counter the perceived threat of Communist Party influence.\n\nThe Arbitration Court made orders against the requiring it to comply with the Metal Trades Award. The strike continued and on 20 May 1955 the FIA was found to be contempt of court despite genuine attempts to have the employees return to work. No fine was imposed however the FIA had to pay legal costs of 160 guineas.\n\nMembers of the Boilermakers Society of Australia were among those supporting the strikers by paying the levy of 8 shillings per week. They also put a ban on repair work on the cargo ship Poul Carl. and the Metal Trades Employers Association sought an order requiring the Boilermakers to comply with the Metal Trades Award. On 21 May 1955 the Arbitration Court, Kirby, Dunphy and Ashburner JJ, held that it had no alternative but to make the orders. The Boilermakers were subsequently found to be in contempt of court by permitting its members to contribute \"strike pay\", thereby actively subsidiing the strike and prolonging it. The Boilermakers were fined A£500 and ordered to pay the employers legal costs.\n\nThe Boilermakers applied to the High Court for a writ of prohibition compelling Kirby, Dunphy and Ashburner and the Metal Trades Employers Association, to appear before the High Court to show cause why they should not be prohibited from further proceeding on orders. The Boilermakers challenged the orders on the grounds that sections of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act were invalid in that the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration was given non-judicial powers (administrative, arbitral, executive and legislative powers) as well as judicial powers and the separation of powers in Chapter III of the Constitution meant that the same body could not exercise judicial and non-judicial powers. Eggleston appeared for the Boilermakers. Menzies appeared for the Arbitration Court and the Attorney-General. Macfarlan appeared for the Metal Trades Employers Association.\n\nThe High Court held that the judicial power of the Commonwealth could not be vested in a tribunal that also exercised non-judicial functions. It is a major case dealing with the separation of powers in Australian law.\n\nDixon CJ, McTiernan, Fullagar and Kitto JJ held that is was:\nimpossible to escape the conviction that Chap. III does not allow the exercise of a jurisdiction which of its very nature belongs to the judicial power of the Commonwealth by a body established for purposes foreign to the judicial power, notwithstanding that it is organized as a court and in a manner which might otherwise satisfy ss. 71 and 72, and that Chap. III does not allow a combination with judicial power of functions which are not ancillary or incidental to its exercise but are foreign to it.\n\nThere were three key elements to the majority decision\n\nEach of the dissenting judges took a slightly different approach. Williams J agreed that only a court could exercise judicial power, but held that there was no express prohibition on a court exercising non-judicial powers, rejecting an \"implication in the Constitution arising from the vague concept of the separation of powers\". Webb J held that the Constitution should be interpreted liberally and the previous decisions of the High Court should be followed. Taylor J saw difficulties in defining or identifying judicial functions, including the overlapping powers or functions that could not be clearly defined as exclusively legislative, executive or judicial.\n\nThe majority, Dixon CJ, McTiernan, Fullagar and Kitto JJ, held simply that the Arbitration Court was \"a tribunal established and equipped primarily and predominantly for the work of industrial conciliation and arbitration\" and thus held it was the attachment of powers of judicial enforcement that were invalid.\n\nWilliams J held that if the combination of powers was not permissible, it would be the arbitral functions that would be invalid. Webb J took a different approach, holding that while judicial power could only be exercised by judges, the arbitral functions could be exercised by anyone, including by individuals who happened to be judges, referred to as persona designata. Taylor J did not address this issue.\n\nOn 1 June 1956 the Attorney General obtained leave to appeal to the Privy Council, and was represented by the Solicitor-General, Bailey . The Boilermakers filed submissions by Eggleston , however they did not appear at the hearing.\n\nThe advice of the Privy Council was delivered by Viscount Simonds. The Privy Council largely followed the reasoning of the majority of the High Court.\n\nThe question in whatever for it is stated is whether and how far judicial and non-judicial power can be united in the same body. Their Lordships do not doubt that the decision of the High Court is right and that there is nothing in Chap. III, to which alone recourse can be had, which justifies such a union.\nThe Privy Council concluded that \"The true criterion is not what powers are expressly or by implication excluded from the scope of Chapter III but what powers are expressly or by implication included in it\".\n\nThe significance of the case was that it restricted the use of judicial power only to Chapter III courts (under the Australian Constitution), as well as establishing that these courts could exercise no other power. In this way, it clarified the separation of powers doctrine in Australia.\n\nThe decision led to the abolition of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration and the creation of two new Australian industrial relations bodies: the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission (later known as the Australian Industrial Relations Commission), whose limited-term members could create industrial awards and settle interstate industrial disputes, and the Commonwealth Industrial Court, whose judges could interpret and enforce awards made by the Commission.\n\nThere are few Privy Council decisions about the Australian Constitution that are cited in the High Court. While the decision in Boilermakers is often cited, it is High Court decision that is cited, with the notation that it was affirmed by the Privy Council.\n"}

The library holds around a million items, with about a quarter of the holdings on display in the reading rooms and the rest held in storage. It is one of the busiest libraries in Oxford, with just over 120,000 visits by approximately 16,000 individuals, and 272,000 items checked out or renewed, in 2008/9.\n\nThe scientific books housed in the Radcliffe Camera were transferred to the Oxford University Museum of Natural History in 1861. On land next to the museum (on the corner of Parks Road and South Parks Road) a new library building opened in 1901, the Radcliffe Library. Like a number of other buildings in Oxford, the library was named after John Radcliffe, a major benefactor of the University.\n\nIn 1927, the library lost its independence, for financial efficiency becoming part of the Bodleian Library. The library took on its current name, the Radcliffe Science Library, and gained the right as a legal deposit library to receive a copy of all new British scientific publications.\n\nThe library has doors with relief wood carvings by Don Potter, undertaken while he was studying with the sculptor Eric Gill.\n\nWith the construction of a basement in the 1970s, part of the building was used to form The Hooke Library, a (separate) science lending library for undergraduates, which was named after Robert Hooke, a scientist who worked in Oxford. The Hooke Library housed its collection in the ground floor of the Abbot's Kitchen which was originally part of the University Museum and on the staircase at the eastern end of the Jackson Wing of the RSL. The area which housed the Hooke Library collection is now part of the RSL with the ground floor of the Abbot's Kitchen transformed into a refreshment area and a training room.\n\nUntil 2007, the library was a reference library rather than a lending library. During 2007 the building and collection of the Hooke Library was integrated into the RSL.\n\nThe RSL building consists of three parts, developed as expansion of the library was necessary:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2319031", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2319031", "title": "Standard of care", "text": "Standard of care\n\nIn tort law, the standard of care is the only degree of prudence and caution required of an individual who is under a duty of care.\n\nThe requirements of the standard are closely dependent on circumstances. Whether the standard of care has been breached is determined by the trier of fact, and is usually phrased in terms of the reasonable person. It was famously described in \"Vaughn v. Menlove\" (1837) as whether the individual \"proceed[ed] with such reasonable caution as a prudent man would have exercised under such circumstances\".\n\nIn certain industries and professions, the standard of care is determined by the standard that would be exercised by the reasonably prudent manufacturer of a product, or the reasonably prudent professional in that line of work. Such a test (known as the \"Bolam Test\") is used to determine whether a doctor is liable for medical malpractice. The standard of care is important because it determines the level of negligence required to state a valid cause of action. In the business world the standard of care taken can be described as Due Diligence or performing a Channel Check.\n\nA standard of care is a medical or psychological treatment guideline, and can be general or specific. It specifies appropriate treatment based on scientific evidence and collaboration between medical and/or psychological professionals involved in the treatment of a given condition.\n\nSome common examples:\n\n1. Diagnostic and treatment process that a clinician should follow for a certain type of patient, illness, or clinical circumstance. Adjuvant chemotherapy for lung cancer is \"a new standard of care, but not necessarily the only standard of care\". (\"New England Journal of Medicine\", 2004)\n\n2. In legal terms, the level at which an ordinary, prudent professional with the same training and experience in good standing in a same or similar community would practice under the same or similar circumstances. An \"average\" standard would not apply because in that case at least half of any group of practitioners would not qualify. The medical malpractice plaintiff must establish the appropriate standard of care and demonstrate that the standard of care has been breached, with expert testimony.\n\n3. A physician also has a \"duty to inform\" a patient of any material risks or fiduciary interests of the physician that might cause the patient to reconsider a procedure, and may be liable if injury occurs due to the undisclosed risk, and the patient can prove that if he had been informed he would not have gone through with the procedure, without benefit of hindsight. (Informed Consent Rule.) Full disclosure of all material risks incident to treatment must be fully disclosed, unless doing so would impair urgent treatment. As it relates to mental health professionals standard of care, the California Supreme Court, held that these professionals have \"duty to protect\" \nindividuals who are specifically threatened by a patient. [\"Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California\", 17 Cal. 3d 425, 551 P.2d 334, 131 Cal. Rptr. 14 (Cal. 1976)].\n\n4. A recipient of \"pro bono\" (free) services (either legal or medical) is entitled to expect the same standard of care as a person who pays for the same services, to prevent an indigent person from being entitled to only substandard care.\n\nMedical standards of care exist for many conditions, including diabetes, some cancers, and sexual abuse.\n\nA special standard of care also applies to children, who, in a majority of jurisdictions, are held to the behavior that is reasonable for a child of similar age, experience, and intelligence under like circumstances. (Restatement (Second) of Torts §283A; \"Cleveland Rolling-Mill Co. v. Corrigan\", 46 Ohio St. 283, 20 N.E. 466 (1889).) In some cases it means that more may be required of a child of superior intelligence. (Compare \"Jones v. Fireman's Insurance Co. of Newark, New Jersey\", 240 So.2d 780 [La.App. 1970] with \"Robinson v. Travis\", 393 So.2d 304 (La.App. 1980). An exception is for children engaged in \"adult activity.\" \"Dellwo v. Pearson\", 107 N.W.2d 859 (Minn 1961) \"Nicholsen v. Brown\", 232 Or. 426, 374 P.2d 896 (1962) (automobile); \"Daniels v. Evans\", 102 N.H. 407, 224 A. 2d 63 (1966) (motor scooter); \"Neumann. v. Shlansky\", 58 Misc. 2d 128, 294 N.Y.S.2d 628 (1968 (playing golf)) What constitutes an \"adult standard\" may depend on local statute, and some have arbitrary age distinctions. Another exception is if the child is engaged in an \"inherently dangerous activity.\" It is up to the trier of fact to decide if the activity is inherently dangerous. If they find that it is, the child must be held to an adult standard of care. \"Robinson v. Lindsay\", 92 Wash.2d 410, 598 P.2d 2392 (1979) (snowmobile);\n\nA person with a disability is held to the same standard of care that an ordinary reasonable person would observe if he suffered from that same disability. (\"Roberts v. State of Louisiana\", 396 So.2d 566 (1981) (blind postal employee)) However, courts do not recognize a person with a \"mental\" disability to be subject to any such special standard, and are held to the \"reasonable prudent person\" standard, except when the onset of mental illness is unforeseeable and sudden (e.g., \"Breunig v. American Family Insurance Co\"., 45 Wis.2d 536, 173 N.W.2d 619 (1970) (sudden hallucinations while driving).) In some situations, this could work an injustice. Physical handicaps and infirmities, such as blindness,\ndeafness, short stature, or a club foot, or the weaknesses of age or sex, are treated merely\nas part of the “circumstances” under which a reasonable man must act.\n\nA person engaged in a special and potentially dangerous activity must know or inquire of possible hazards or of any special duties and responsibilities inherent in that activity that might affect their ability to exercise reasonable prudent caution (\"cf, Delair v. McAdoo\", 324 Pa. 392, 188 A. 181 (1936) (driving on worn tires).) Custom and practice of usage may be useful evidence for determining the usual standard, but not determinative of what a reasonable prudent person \"ought\" to be required to do or know (cf., \"Trimarco v. Klein\", 58 N.Y. 2d 98 (1982) (showerdoor glass).) As Justice Holmes classic statement expresses it, \"What usually is done may be evidence of what ought to be done, but what ought to be done is fixed by a standard of reasonable prudence, whether it is complied with or not.\"\n\nA person of substandard intelligence is held under common law to the same standard of a reasonable prudent person, to encourage them to exert a decreased effort of responsibility to their community, in light of their handicap, and as a result of the practical difficulty of proving what reduced standard should apply (\"Vaughn v. Menlove\", 3 Bing. (N.C.) 468, 432 Eng.Rep.490 (1837).) Restatement (Second) of Torts, § 289 cmt. n (noting that the “reasonable person” standard makes allowances for age and physical disability but not “attention, perception, memory, knowledge of other pertinent matters, intelligence, and judgment. Oliver Wendell Holmes, The Common Law, 108 (Little, Brown, & Co. 1881): “The standards of the law are standards of general application. The law takes no account of the infinite varieties of temperament, intellect, and education which make the internal character of a given act so different in different men.”\n\nAn attorney is held to the standard that any reasonable attorney in possession of the same knowledge and skill that an ordinary member of his or her profession possesses, as long as he is acting with reasonable care and diligence, in good faith and honest belief that his advice and acts are well founded at the time. Here, mere errors in judgment are excusable (Best Judgment Rule) and cannot be judged solely with the gift of hindsight without substantial injustice. He or she is required to exercise ordinary care and caution (diligence) in the use of that skill (Due Care Rule), and procedural and technical failures are held to be the most common breaches. (cf, \"Hodges v. Carter\", 239 N.C. 517, 80 S.E.2d 144 (1954). (failed service of process).)\n\nIn \"Cordas v. Peerless Taxi Company\", 27 N.Y.S.2d 198 (1941), Justice Carlin held that a taxicab driver hijacked at gunpoint by a fleeing mugger in New York City may be excused from negligence for jumping out of the moving taxicab to save his own life, leaving the cab on an unguided trajectory towards bystanders. While some persons might choose to be singularly heroic, that standard is not one that is required for an ordinary prudent person. Such a person is held excused from liability, even if such failure might endanger others. An ordinary prudent person is not under any obligation to undertake a heroic duty at the risk of his own life. \"The first duty in an emergency is to one's own self, as long as that person did not contribute to or cause the emergency.\" (Emergency Doctrine.)\n\nWhen a state criminal statute is violated in the course of performing an assertedly negligent act, under certain circumstances a court may adopt the statute as establishing a standard of care for tortious liability as well. This is negligence \"per se\". It follows the reasoning that if a legislature reached findings of public interest in enacting the statute, these same considerations could arguably apply in cases of negligence. There is no negligence \"per se\" doctrine in federal law.\n\nFour elements are deemed necessary for a statute to apply in a negligence case. First the person harmed must be a member of the class of persons which the law was intended to protect. Second, the danger or harm must be one that the law was intended to prevent. Thirdly, there must be some causal relationship established between the breach of the statute and the harm caused. Fourthly, the criminal statute must be concrete, specific and measurable enough to clearly establish a standard of breach. Courts are reluctant to create new torts out of criminal statutes. (See Restatement (Second) of Torts, sections 297, 288.)\n\nHowever, there are five valid excuses that are available for a defendant to defeat a standard of negligence \"per se\". (Restatement (Second) of Torts section 288.1(2).) First, the defendant may not know of the breach due to incompetence. Secondly, he might either lack knowledge or reason to know of the breach or duty. Furthermore, for some explainable reason, he may be unable to comply, despite diligence. The breach may be due to a sudden emergency not of one’s own making. And lastly, in special situations it may be safer to not comply than to comply. In cases where these defenses are applied, negligence \"per se\" doctrine creates no more than a rebuttable presumption of negligence that shifts the burden of proof from the plaintiff to the defendant.\n\nIn balancing risks to establish a reasonable person's standard of ordinary care, the calculus of negligence establishes that the probability of the harm potentially caused (P) must be balanced along with the gravity of the harm which could result (G), against the burden of conforming to a new and less dangerous course of action (B) along with the utility of maintaining the same course of action as it was (U). This is sometimes noted in shorthand as P+G v. B+U, deriving from a formulation expressed by Judge Learned Hand. (\"United States v. Carroll Towing Co.\", 159 F.2d 169 (1947).)\n\nIn the Hospitailty industries, the standard of care is higher, as the Innkeeper is expected to seek out potential danger and prevent it. \" Innkeeper/Common Carrier - very high degree of care - liable for slight negligence\" \n\n"}
{"id": "99302", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=99302", "title": "Stockton, California", "text": "Stockton, California\n\nStockton is a city in and the county seat of San Joaquin County in the Central Valley of the U.S. state of California. Stockton was founded by Captain Charles Maria Weber in 1849 after he acquired Rancho Campo de los Franceses. The city is named after Robert F. Stockton, and it was the first community in California to have a name not of Spanish or Native American origin. The city is located on the San Joaquin River in the northern San Joaquin Valley and had an estimated population of 320,554 by the California Department of Finance for 2017. Stockton is the 13th largest city in California and the 63rd largest city in the United States. It was named an All-America City in 1999, 2004, 2015 and again in 2017.\n\nBuilt during the California Gold Rush, Stockton's seaport serves as a gateway to the Central Valley and beyond. It provided easy access for trade and transportation to the southern gold mines. The University of the Pacific (UOP), chartered in 1851, is the oldest university in California, and has been located in Stockton since 1923. As a result of the 2008 financial crisis, Stockton was the second largest city in the United States to file for bankruptcy protection. Stockton successfully exited bankruptcy in February 2015.\n\nStockton is situated amidst the farmland of California's San Joaquin Valley, a subregion of the Central Valley. In and around Stockton are thousands of miles of waterways, which make up the California Delta.\n\nInterstate 5 and State Route 99, inland California's major north-south highways, pass through the city. State Route 4 and the dredged San Joaquin River connect the city with the San Francisco Bay Area to its west. Stockton and Sacramento are California's only inland sea ports.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city occupies a total area of , of which is land and (4.76%) is water.\n\nWhen Europeans first visited the Stockton area, the Yatchicumne, a branch of the Northern Valley Yokuts Indians, occupied the Stockton area. They built their villages on low mounds to keep their homes above regular floods. A Yokuts village named Pasasimas was located on a mound between Edison and Harrison Streets on what is now the Stockton Channel in downtown Stockton.\n\nThe Siskiyou Trail began in the northern San Joaquin Valley. It was a centuries-old Native American footpath that lead through the Sacramento Valley over the Cascades and into present-day Oregon.\n\n\nCaptain Charles Maria Weber, a German, immigrated to America in 1836. After spending time in Texas, he came overland from Missouri to California with the Bartleson-Bidwell Party in 1841. Shortly after his arrival, Karl called himself Charles. Weber went to work for John Sutter who vouched for \"Carlos Maria Weber\" to the Mexican authorities. In 1842, Weber settled in the Pueblo of San José and became a business partner of Guillermo (William) Gulnac.\n\nAs an alien, Weber could not secure a land grant directly, so he formed a partnership with William Gulnac. Born in New York, Gulnac had married a Mexican woman and sworn allegiance to Mexico, which then ruled California. He applied in Weber's place for Rancho Campo de los Franceses a land grant of eleven square leagues on the east side of the San Joaquin River.\n\nGulnac and Weber dissolved their partnership in 1843. Gulnac's attempts to settle the Rancho Campo de los Franceses failed, and Weber acquired the Rancho Campo de los Franceses from Gulnac in 1845. In 1846, Weber had induced a number of settlers to locate on the rancho, when the Mexican–American War broke out. Considered a Californio, Weber was offered the position of captaincy by Mexican General José Castro, which he declined, and he later accepted the position of Captain in the Cavalry of the United States. Captain Weber's decision to change sides lost him a great deal of the trust he had built up among his Mexican business partners. As a result, Weber moved to the grant in 1847 and sold his business in San Jose in 1849.\n\n\nAt the start of the California Gold Rush in 1848, Europeans and Americans started to arrive in the area of Webers rancho on their way to the goldfeilds. When Captain Charles Maria Weber, a German immigrant, decided to try his hand at gold mining in late 1848, he soon found selling supplies to gold-seekers was more profitable.\n\nAs the head of navigation on the San Joaquin River, a city grew rapidly as a miners' supply point during the California Gold Rush. Weber built the first permanent residence in the San Joaquin Valley on a piece of land now known as Weber Point. During the California Gold Rush, the location of what is now Stockton developed as a river port, the hub of roads to the gold settlements in the San Joaquin Valley and northern terminus of the Stockton - Los Angeles Road. During its early years, Stockton was known by several names, including \"Weberville,\" \"Fat City,\" \"Mudville,\" and \"California's Sunrise Seaport.\" In 1849, Weber laid out a town, which he named \"Tuleburg,\" but soon decided on \"Stockton\" in honor of Commodore Robert F. Stockton. Stockton was the first community in California to have a name that was neither Spanish nor Native American in origin.\n\n\nThousands of Chinese came to Stockton from the Kwangtung province of China during the 1850s due to a combination of political and economic unrest in China and the discovery of gold in California. After the gold rush, many worked for the railroads and land reclamation projects in the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta and remained in Stockton. By 1880, Stockton was home to the third-largest Chinese community in California. Discriminatory laws, in particular the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, restricted immigration and prevented the Chinese from buying property. The Lincoln Hotel, built in 1920 by the Wong brothers on South El Dorado Street, was considered one of Stockton's finest hotels of the time. Only after the Magnuson Act was repealed in 1962, were American-born Chinese allowed to buy property and own buildings.\n\n\nThe city was officially incorporated on July 23, 1850, by the county court, and the first city election was held on July 31, 1850. In 1851, the City of Stockton received its charter from the State of California. Early settlers included gold seekers from Asia, Africa, Australia, Europe, the Pacific Islands, Mexico and Canada. The historical population diversity is reflected in Stockton street names, architecture, numerous ethnic festivals, and in the faces and heritage of a majority of its citizens. In 1870, the Census Bureau reported Stockton's population as 87.6% white and 10.7% Asian. Many Chinese were immigrating to California as workers in these years, especially for the Transcontinental Railroad.\n\nBenjamin Holt settled in Stockton in 1883 and with his three brothers founded the Stockton Wheel Co., and later the Holt Manufacturing Company. On Thanksgiving Day, Nov. 24, 1904, Holt successfully tested the first workable track-laying machine, plowing soggy San Joaquin Valley Delta farmland. Company photographer Charles Clements was reported to have observed that the tractor crawled like a caterpillar, and Holt seized on the metaphor. \"Caterpillar it is. That's the name for it.\" \n\nOn April 22, 1918 British Army officer Colonel Ernest Dunlop Swinton visited Stockton while on a tour of the United States. The British and French armies were using many hundreds of Holt tractors to haul heavy guns and supplies during World War I, and Swinton publicly thanked Holt and his workforce for their contribution to the war effort. During 1914 and 1915, Swinton had advocated basing some sort of armored fighting vehicle on Holt's caterpillar tractors, but without success. (Although Britain did develop tanks, they came from a separate source and were not directly derived from Holt machines). After the appearance of tanks on the battlefield, Holt built a prototype, the gas-electric tank, but it did not enter production.\n\nThe extensive network of waterways in and around Stockton was fished and navigated by Miwok Indians for centuries. During the California Gold Rush, the San Joaquin River was navigable by ocean-going vessels, making Stockton a natural inland seaport and point of supply and departure for prospective gold-miners. From the mid-19th century onward, Stockton became the region's transportation hub, dealing mainly with agricultural products. By 1931 the Stockton Electric Railroad Company operated forty streetcars over 28 miles of track.\n\nStockton is the site of the first Sikh temple in the United States; Gurdwara Sahib Stockton opened on October 24, 1912. It was founded by Baba Jawala Singh and Baba Wasakha Singh, successful Punjabi immigrants who farmed and owned on the Holt River.\n\nIn 1933, the port was modernized, and the Stockton Deepwater Channel, which improved water passage to San Francisco Bay, was deepened and completed. This created commercial opportunities that fueled the city's growth. Ruff and Ready Island Naval Supply Depot was established, placing Stockton in a strategic position during the Cold War. During the Great Depression, the town's canning industry became the battleground of a labor dispute resulting in the Spinach Riot of 1937.\n\nDuring World War II, the Stockton Assembly Center was built on the San Joaquin County Fairgrounds, a few blocks from what was then the city center. One of fifteen temporary detention sites run by the Wartime Civilian Control Administration, the center held some 4,200 Japanese Americans removed from their West Coast homes under Executive Order 9066, while they waited for transfer to more permanent and isolated camps in the interior of the country. The center opened on May 10, 1942 and operated until October 17, when the majority of its population was sent to Rohwer, Arkansas. The former incarceration site was named a California Historical Landmark in 1980, and in 1984 a marker was erected at the entrance to the fairgrounds.\n\nIn September 1996, the Base Realignment and Closure Commission announced the final closure of Stockton's Naval Reserve Center on Rough and Ready Island. Formerly known as Ruff and Ready Island Naval Supply Depot, the island's facilities had served as a major communications outpost for submarine activities in the Pacific during the Cold War. The site is slowly being redeveloped as commercial property.\n\nHistorically an agricultural community, Stockton's economy has since diversified into other industries, which include telecommunications and manufacturing.\n\nStockton's central location, relative to both San Francisco and Sacramento, as well as its proximity to the state and interstate freeway system, together with its comparatively inexpensive land costs, have prompted several companies base their regional operations in the city.\n\nBeginning in the late 1990s, under the mayorship of Gary Podesto, Stockton had commenced some revitalization projects. Newly built or renovated buildings include the Bob Hope Theater, Regal City Centre Cinemas and IMAX, San Joaquin RTD Downtown Transit Center, Lexington Plaza Waterfront Hotel, Hotel Stockton, Stockton Arena, San Joaquin County Administration Building, and the Stockton Ballpark.\n\nThe \"sunken parking lot\" in front of the Hotel Stockton was transformed in the late 1990s into a public space named \"Dean DeCarli Waterfront Square.\" The area is designed to include a variety of spaces and flexible uses: a sunken plaza, shade structure, numerous trees and planters, stadia seating, bench seating, viewing platforms, a weir at the west end, and a cascading waterfall at the east end. DeCarli Square has become a popular urban place hosting music, art and religious events, festivals, farmers' markets, and social gatherings.\n\nA new downtown marina and adjacent Joan Darah Promenade were added along the south shore of the Stockton Deep Water Channel during 2009. Various public art projects were also installed throughout the area (see Stockton's public art section).\n\nOther projects under consideration by the city council as of January 2009 include South Shore housing, the revitalization of the Robert J. Cabral Train Station neighborhood, bridges across the Stockton Deep Water Channel, and a new San Joaquin County Court House.\n\nIn the summer 2018 the major of Stockton will test a Universal Basic Income.\n\nThe Stockton real estate market was disproportionately affected by the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis, and the city led the United States in foreclosures for that year, with one of every 30 homes posted for foreclosure. From September 2006 to September 2007, the value of a median-priced house in Stockton declined by 44%.\n\nStockton's Weston Ranch neighborhood, a subdivision of modest tract homes built in the mid-1990s, had the worst foreclosure rate in the area according to ACORN, a now defunct national advocacy group for low and moderate-income families. Stockton found itself squarely at the center of the United States' speculative housing bubble in the 2000s. Real estate in Stockton more than tripled in value between 1998 and 2005, but when the bubble burst in 2007, the ensuing financial crisis made Stockton one of the hardest-hit cities in United States.\n\nStockton housing prices fell 39% in the 2008 fiscal year, and the city had the country's highest foreclosure rate (9.5%) as well. Because of the shrinking economy, Stockton also had an unemployment rate of 13.3% in 2008, one of the highest in the United States. Stockton was rated by Forbes in 2009 as America's fifth most dangerous city because of its crime rate. In 2010, mainly due to the aforementioned factors, Forbes named it one of the three worst places to live.\n\nFollowing regional losses to the economy due to the 2008 financial crisis, in July 2012, Stockton became the largest city in U.S. history to file for bankruptcy protection. It was surpassed by Detroit in July 2013. The city approved of a plan to exit bankruptcy in October 2013, and voters approved a sales tax on November 5, 2013 to help fund the exit.\n\nThe collapse in real estate valuations had a negative effect on the city's revenue base. On June 28, 2012, Stockton filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy. On April 1, 2013, a federal judge accepted the bankruptcy application. On April 1, 2013, judge Christopher M. Klein, United States Bankruptcy Court Easter District of California, Sacramento Division, ruled that Stockton was eligible for bankruptcy protection.\n\nThe Stockton bankruptcy case lasted more than two years and received nationwide attention. While there were many possible factors that led to the Chapter 9 filing including the real estate crash and failed city projects, Stockton was watched along with Detroit to see whether a federal judge will override state law and rule that pensions for municipal employees could be at risk. At issue were the contractual obligations to CalPERS that cities throughout California have undertaken. Pensions in California are protected by the so-called \"California Rule,\" which says that public workers are guaranteed the pension in place the day they were hired.\n\nOn October 4, 2013, Stockton City Council approved a bankruptcy exit plan by a six-zero vote to be filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Eastern District of California, Sacramento. Voters approved a 3/4-cent sales tax, which would help fund the bankruptcy exit, on November 5, 2013.\n\nIf federal courts rule on this aspect of the bankruptcy exit plan it could set a precedent for a state with one of the largest municipal bond markets in the country. According to the US Constitution and laws passed by the US Congress all bankruptcies in the US are administered by federal courts according to federal law with some allowances for state law.\n\nOn October 30, 2014, a federal bankruptcy judge approved the city's bankruptcy recovery plan, thus allowing the city to continue with the planned pension payments to retired workers.\n\nThe city exited from Chapter 9 bankruptcy on February 25, 2015.\n\nStockton has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: \"Csa\"), with hot, dry summers and mild winters. In an average year, about eighty percent of the of precipitation falls from October through April. Located in the Central Valley, the temperatures range is much greater than in the nearby Bay Area. Tule fog blankets the area during some winter days. Stockton lies in the fertile heart of the California Mediterranean climate prairie delta, about equidistant from the Pacific Ocean and the Sierra Nevada. The intermediate climate between the coast and the central valley gives a similar climate to Badajoz, Spain.\n\nAt the airport, the highest recorded temperature was on July 23, 2006, and the lowest was on January 11, 1949. There are an average of 82 afternoons annually with high temperatures of or higher, and 18 of or above; 19 mornings see low temperatures at or below freezing.

The first chief of police was City Marshal W. W. Willoughby. The city marshal was authorized to hire no more than 20 men as day and night policemen. He was required to structure his department with a police captain, an assistant captain and two sergeants. The first station house was located on the corner of Center Street and Market Street. In February 1861, the city council created the position of Chief of Police. His annual salary was $900 and the chief would be elected by the public. On May 6, 1862, George E. Taber was elected the first Chief of Police for the city of Stockton.\n\nIn 1886 Stockton police officers were required to wear blue uniforms and a six-point star badge.

In 2012, the City of Stockton was the 10th most dangerous city in America, reporting 1,417 violent crimes per 100,000 persons, well above the national average, and 22 murders per 100,000 (above the average of 4.7). In 2013, violent crime lessened to 1,230.3 crimes per 100,000 population, making it 19th on the list of the most dangerous cities. Stockton has experienced a high rate of violent crime, reaching a record high of 71 homicides in 2012 before dropping to 32 for all of 2013.\n\nStockton Police Chief Eric Jones credited 2013's drop in the murder rate to Operation Ceasefire, a gun violence intervention strategy pioneered in Boston and implemented in Stockton in 2012, combined with a federal gun and narcotics operation.\n\n\nOn January 17, 1989, the Stockton Police Department received a threat against Cleveland Elementary School from an unknown person.

In 2005, all 13 of the city's stations met the National Fire Protection Association standard of a 5-minute response time. In 2009, it had 13 fire stations and over 275 career personnel. Due in part to staffing levels that placed five staff on ladder companies and four staff on engines, it was one of only 57 departments among 44,000 to receive the Class 1 rating in 2010.\n\nThe department maintained this rating until 2011, when during the city's Chapter 9 bankruptcy proceedings and following a Civil Grand Jury investigation, the city reduced staffing levels from 220 full-time staff to 177, and the 2011 budget from $59 million to $40 million. The department was cut by 30%. The bankruptcy was due in part to a 1996 decision made by the city to provide firefighters with free health care after retirement, which they later expanded to all city employees. The benefit gradually grew into a $417 million liability.\n\n, the department consists of 12 firehouses that house 12 Engine Companies and three Truck Companies.

Stockton had placed second in this listing in 2008.\n\nStockton was home to the world's first radio disc jockey, Ray Newby. In 1909, at 16 years of age, Newby began regularly playing records on a small transmitter while a student at Herrold College of Engineering and Wireless, located in San Jose, California, under the authority of radio pioneer Charles \"Doc\" Herrold.\n\nNick and Nate Diaz, who are MMA fighters fighting under the UFC promotional banner, are also famously from the \"209\" Stockton, California. They are known to promote themselves using Stockton almost like N.W.A. used Compton. They also wear fight clothes with 209 on them. They can be seen shouting \"Stockton 209 motherfucker\" in numerous interviews and press conferences. Their team, which includes other MMA fighters such as Gilbert Melendez, Jake Shields, Nick Diaz, Daniel Roberts, Nate Diaz and David Terrell under the leadership of Cesar Gracie, are known as the Stockton Skrap Pack and have been involved in several infamous brawls in and outside the Octagon.\n\nJose M. Hernandez, a famous NASA astronaut and engineer also refers to Stockton as his hometown. Akiko Billings, a notable womens engineer and advocate born in Fiji, considers Stockton her American home.\n\nStockton has seven sister cities:\n\nIn 2013 the City of Stockton released a nearly 1 billion dollar 5 year capital improvement plan. However, the capital improvement plan was still inadequate to address ongoing maintenance and upkeep of Stockton's public infrastructure. In April 2016, City Public Works Director Gordon Mackay estimated maintenance funding shortfalls for roads, parks, and city trees.\n\n\n"}

It alone undertakes the judicial control in respect of the constitutionality of the laws and regulations and shall undertake the interpretation of the legislative texts in the manner prescribed by law. In addition, the court is empowered to settle competence disputes between the judicial and the administrative courts.\n\nThe establishment of the Supreme Constitutional Court goes back to the argument which was raised over the right of courts or any judicial bodies to pronounce on the constitutionality of the laws issued by the Legislative power. Such a judicial argument has been advocated in arguing that considering the issue of the constitutionality of laws is included in the competence of the courts. Therefore, it does not prejudice in any way the principle of separation of powers. The argument of such a party was, however, based on a basic assertion that discussing this issue is but a sheer legal act as the core and crux of this matter is represented in interpreting the laws which were appealed against as unconstitutional, a matter of a legal nature in the first place. Indeed, the Egyptian legislator adopted this approach when the court was established in 1969 and was then called the \"Supreme Court\" entrusted to censoring the laws' constitutionality. The aforementioned court was existent till its replacement with the SCC in 1979.\n\nThe establishment of the Court has been stipulated in the body of the Egyptian Constitution in 1971. Judges are appointed for life by the president, with mandatory retirement at the age of 70. Articles from 174 to 178 talked about this court, its competences and its staff. And, according to Article 174, the Court is an independent judicial authority whose headquarters is in Cairo. The SCC is alone responsible for censoring the constitutionality of the laws and regulations and it assumes interpreting legislative texts. By virtue of constitutional provisions, the law No. 48/1979, known as that of the Supreme Court, has been issued. Article No. 25 of this law has specified the competences of this court as follows:\n\nThe SCC can, in all cases, judge on the unconstitutionality of any provision in a law or a regulation being presented to it when assuming its competences and connected to the dispute presented before it.\n\nThe president of the Supreme Court was the head of the Presidential Election Commission that supervised and ran the country's first multi-candidate presidential elections in 2005.\n\nThe new building (completed in the year 2000) was designed by Ahmed Mito, a young Egyptian architect. It is an unusual contemporary instance of Egyptian Revival architecture, a style more popular in the nineteenth century. Covering 4000 m, it also includes counseling halls, a multi purpose hall for 450 people, offices, a library, a museum, 33 consultants' offices and a large atrium that rises up to 18 meters and is covered by a dome.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "34183901", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34183901", "title": "Surrogacy laws by country", "text": "Surrogacy laws by country\n\nThe legal aspects of surrogacy in any particular jurisdiction tend to hinge on a few central questions:\n\nLaws differ widely from one jurisdiction to another.\n\nIn Australia, all jurisdictions except the Northern Territory allow altruistic surrogacy; with commercial surrogacy being a criminal offense. The Northern Territory has no legislation governing surrogacy. In New South Wales, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory it is an offence to enter into international commercial surrogacy arrangements with potential penalties extending to imprisonment for up to one year in Australian Capital Territory, up to two years imprisonment in New South Wales and up to three years imprisonment in Queensland.\n\nIn 2004, the Australian Capital Territory made only altruistic surrogacy legal.\n\nIn 2006, Australian senator Stephen Conroy and his wife Paula Benson announced that they had arranged for a child to be born through egg donation and gestational surrogacy. Unusually, Conroy was put on the birth certificate as the father of the child. Previously, couples who used to make surrogacy arrangements in Australia had to adopt the child after it was registered as born to the natural mother; rather than being recognized as birth parents, however now that surrogacy is more regular practice for childless parents; most states have switched to such arrangements to give the intended parents proper rights.\nAfter the announcement, Victoria passed the \"Assisted Reproductive Treatment Act 2008\", effective since 1 January 2010 to make only altruistic surrogacy legal.\n\nIn 2009, Western Australia passed a law to allow only altruistic surrogacy for couples of the opposite-sex only, and to prohibit it for single people and same-sex couples. In 2010, Queensland made only altruistic surrogacy legal, as did New South Wales, and Tasmania did the same in 2013 with the \"Surrogacy Act No 34\" and the \"Surrogacy (Consequential Amendments) Act No 31\"\n\nIn 2017, South Australia passed a bill to allow gay couples equal access to both surrogacy and IVF. The bill received royal assent on 15 March 2017 and went into effect on 21 March 2017.\n\nA Medicare rebate is not available for IVF treatment for surrogacy.\n\nAltrustic surrogacy is legal in Belgium. \n\nThe Assisted Human Reproduction Act (AHRC) permits only altruistic surrogacy: surrogate mothers may be reimbursed for approved expenses but payment of any other consideration or fee is illegal. Quebec law, however, does not recognize surrogacy arrangements, whether commercial or altruistic.\n\nThe Quebec Civil Code renders all surrogacy contracts, whether commercial or altruistic, unenforceable.\n\nThere are no clear rules in Colombia as of today regarding surrogacy and a loophole persists. The current laws applied are those from a natural childbirth. This means the child must be registered with the surnames of the surrogate mother and her partner or spouse, if she has any. Only through a challenging paternity lawsuit before a judge may the commissioning parents be recognized as legal parents, and it may include genetic tests.\n\nIn July 2016, a right wing political party, Democratic Center, has introduced for the second time a bill in order to determine the concept of surrogacy and to forbid any types of it.\n\nSurrogacy is not legally regulated in the Czech Republic and so is generally considered legal. The only mention of the phrase \"surrogate motherhood\" can be found in § 804 of the law n. 89/2012, where the law designates an exception to the ban of adoption by siblings for siblings carried by a surrogate mother.\n\nAltruistic surrogacy is legal in Denmark.\n\nAll surrogacy arrangements (both commercial and altruistic) have been illegal since 2007. Commercial surrogacy arrangements were illegal even before 2007.\n\nIn France, since 1994, any surrogacy arrangement that is commercial or altruistic, is illegal or unlawful and is not sanctioned by the law (art 16-7 of the Code Civil).\nThe French Court of Cassation already took this point of view in 1991. It held that if any couple makes an agreement or arranges with another person that she is to bear the husband's child and surrender it on birth to the couple, and that she is choosing that she will not keep the child, the couple making such an agreement or arrangement is not allowed to adopt the child. In its judgement the court held that such an agreement is illegal on the basis of articles 6, 353 and 1128 of the Code Civil. In 2018, France government plans to allow surrogacy in France.\n\nAll surrogacy arrangements (both commercial and altruistic) are illegal. German party FDP wants to allow altruistic surrogacy.\n\nSurrogacy, along with ovum and sperm donation, has been legal in the country of Georgia since 1992. A donor or surrogate mother has no parental rights over such a child.\n\nLaw 3305/2005 (“Enforcement of Medically Assisted Reproduction”)\nSurrogacy in Greece is fully legal and is only one of a handful of countries in the world to give legal protection to intended parents. Intended parents must meet certain qualifications, and will go before a family judge before starting their journey. As long as they meet the qualifications, the court appearance is procedural and will be granted their application. At present, intended parents must be in a heterosexual partnership or be a single female. Females must be able to prove there is a medical indication they cannot carry and be no older than 50 at the time of the contract. As in all jurisdictions, surrogates must pass medical and psychological tests so they can prove to the court that they are medically and mentally fit. What is unique about Greece is that it is the only country in Europe, and one of only countries in the world where the surrogate then has no rights over the child. The intended parents become the legal parents from conception and there is no mention of the surrogate mother anywhere on hospital or birth documents. The intended parent(s) are listed as the parents. This even applies if an egg or sperm donor is used by one of the partners.\nAn added advantage for Europeans is that, due to the Schengen Treaty, they can freely travel home as soon as the baby is born and deal with citizenship issues at that time, as opposed to applying at their own embassy in Greece.\nThe old regime (pursuant to art. 8 of Law 3089/2002), one of the prerequisites for granting the judicial permission for surrogacy was also the fact that the surrogate mother and the commissioning parents should be Greek citizens or permanent residents.\nHowever, the law has recently (in July 2014) changed and the new provisions of L. 4272/2014 foresee now that the surrogacy is allowed to applicants or surrogate mothers who have their permanent or temporary residence in Greece.\nWith this new law Greece becomes the only EU country with a comprehensive framework to regulate, facilitate and enforce surrogacy, as according to the explanatory statement of the art. 17 of the L. 4272/2014: “The possibility is now extending also to applicants or surrogate mothers who have their permanent residence outside Greece”.\n\nCommercial surrogacy is criminal under the Human Reproductive Technology Ordinance 2000. The law is phrased in a manner that no one can pay a surrogate, no surrogate can receive money, and no one can arrange a commercial surrogacy (the same applies to the supply of gametes), no matter within or outside Hong Kong. Normally only the gametes of the intended parents can be used.\n\nIn October 2010, Peter Lee, the eldest son and one of the presumed heirs of billionnaire Lee Shau Kee obtained three sons through a surrogate mother, reportedly from California. Since the junior Lee is single, the news attracted criticism on both moral and legal grounds. A vicar general of the territory's Roman Catholic diocese was critical. In December the case was reportedly referred to police after questions were asked in Legco.\n\nCommercial surrogacy is illegal in Hungary.\n\nAll surrogacy arrangements (both commercial and altruistic) are illegal.\n\nAs of November 4, 2015 commercial surrogacy is not legal in India. Those commissioned before 11/4/2015 are reviewed on case by case situation; however, no new surrogacies will be started.\n\nBefore 2015, commercial surrogacy was legal in India. India was a desitination for surrogacy-related fertility tourism because of the relatively low cost. Including the costs of flight tickets, medical procedures, and hotels, it was roughly a third of the price compared with going through the procedure in the UK. In the case of Balaz v. Union of India the Honorable Supreme Court of India has given the verdict that the citizenship of the child born through this process will have the citizenship of its surrogate mother. Surrogacy was regulated by the Indian Council of Medical Research guidelines, 2005.\n\nThere is no law in Ireland governing surrogacy. In 2005 a Government appointed Commission published a very comprehensive report on Assisted Human Reproduction, which made many recommendations on the broader area of assisted human reproduction. In relation to surrogacy it recommended that the commissioning couple would under Irish law be regarded as the parents of the child. Despite the publication there has been no legislation published and the area essentially remains unregulated. Due to mounting pressure from Irish citizens going abroad to have children through surrogacy, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence published guidelines for them on 21 February 2012.\n\nIn March 1996, the Israeli government legalized gestational surrogacy under the \"Embryo Carrying Agreements Law.\" This law made Israel the first country in the world to implement a form of state-controlled surrogacy in which each and every contract must be approved directly by the state. A state-appointed committee permits surrogacy arrangements to be filed only by Israeli citizens who share the same religion.\nThe numerous restrictions on surrogacy under Israeli law have prompted some intended parents to turn to surrogates outside of the country. Same-sex couples can enter a surrogacy arrangement outside of Israel and have their legal parenthood recognized within Israel.\n\nAll surrogacy arrangements (both commercial and altruistic) are legal and popular. Many couples from middle east do the surrogacy in Iran due to the legal easiness.\n\nAll surrogacy arrangements (both commercial and altruistic) are illegal.\n\nIn March 2008, the Science Council of Japan proposed a ban on surrogacy and said that doctors, agents and their clients should be punished for commercial surrogacy arrangements.\n\nAltruistic surrogacy is legal in the Netherlands. Only commercial surrogacy is illegal in Belgium and the Netherlands. Although altrustic surrogacy is legal, there is only one hospital taking in couples and there are extremely strict rules to get in. This makes a lot of couples seek their treatment outside the Netherlands or Belgium.\n\nAltruistic surrogacy is legal.\n\nGestational surrogacy is currently practiced in Nigeria by a few IVF clinics. The guidelines are as approved by the practice guidelines of the Association of Fertility and Reproductive Health (AFRH) of Nigeria. The ART regulation that is currently being considered by the Senate permits surrogacy and allows some inducement to be paid for transport and other expenses.\n\nSurrogacy is illegal in Pakistan.\n\nSurrogacy is mostly unregulated in Poland. A 2015 news report estimated there are likely dozens surrogate mothers in Poland.\n\nIn 2016, Gestational surrogacy was legalized in Portugal. Discussions on the adoption of this law lasted more than 3 years. The first version of the law was adopted May 13, 2016, but the president vetoed it. He demanded that the law contained rights and obligations of all participants in the process of surrogacy. As a result, the text of the law has been updated, and now surrogacy is legalized and regulated by law in Portugal.\n\nThe basic rules of the law on surrogacy in Portugal\nUse the surrogacy services can only those couples, where the woman can not carry and give birth to a child for medical reasons. This should be documentally confirmed.\nSurrogate motherhood should be altruistic, the woman who agrees to carry and give birth to a child, shouldn’t pay for services.\nThe written agreement must be necessarily issued between the surrogate mother and the genetic parents. The rights and obligations of the parties as well as their actions in cases of force majeure should be included in it.\nAfter the birth, parental rights over the child belong to the genetic parents.\nAccording to the law, the surrogate mother is a woman of child-bearing age who agrees to carry and give birth to a child for the genetic parents, and she doesn’t lay claim to be his mother.\n\nTraditional surrogacy is illegal in Portugal except for some situations that give the right for a surrogate mother to be genetic (for example, if the future adoptive mother is completely barren).\n\nAdoption of the law caused some debate within several Portuguese Christian Churches, though not among the once dominant Roman Catholic Church. Representatives of Brazilian and US based evangelical and Pentecostal churches condemn surrogacy and suggest that infertile couples can/must (depending on the Church) pursue conventional adoption (national or transnational even though the later is banned by law).\n\nHeterosexual and Lesbian Couples can become parents via surrogacy in Portugal as by 2016 all the risks of the program are provided and regulated by law (for example, the occurrence of developmental defects of the baby, miscarriage or abortion). Male Homosexual couples and single men and women of any sexual orientation have not yet been included, but they are not addressed specifically by the law which leaves an opening for a future revision in a more encompassing way. One such revision is on the current manifestos of several parties: the [Left Bloc (B.E)], [People–Animals–Nature (PAN)-and [(Ecologist Party \"The Greens\" (Os Verdes - The Greens)]. They can count on the repeated opposition of the populist right party CDS – People's Party (PP-CDS) and the Social Democratic Party (PPD-PSD), the most socially conservative parties in parliament. The Communist Party (P.C.P) voted against the first proposal, because it was against the recommendations of the National Ethics Counsil, this was also President's argument to decline its approval. \nMost of the Socialist Party voted favourably, as well. By now, this means that gay couples are banned from altruistic surrogacy within Portugal and since the Constitution of Portugal explicitly bans discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, this could be unconstitutional, which is being discussed by the Portuguese Constitutional Court.\n\nGestational surrogacy, even commercial, is legal in Russia, being available to practically all adults willing to be parents. There must be one of several medical indications for surrogacy: absence of uterus, deformity of the uterine cavity or cervix, uterine cavity synechia, somatic diseases contraindicating child bearing, or repeated failure of IVF despite high-quality embryos.\n\nThe first surrogacy program in Russia was successfully implemented in 1995 at the IVF centre of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Institute in St. Petersburg. Public opinion in general is surrogacy-friendly; recent cases of a famous singer and a well-known businesswoman who openly used services of gestational surrogates received positive news coverage. Meanwhile, the Russian Orthodox Church has officially condemned surrogacy. As regards the baptism of the children born through surrogacy, the Russian Orthodox Church holds that a \"child born with the assistance of “surrogate motherhood” can be Baptized according to the wishes of the party that will be raising it, if such are either its “biological parents” or its “surrogate mother,” only after they have recognized that, from the Christian point of view, such reproductive technology is morally reprehensible and have borne ecclesial repentance – regardless of whither they ignored the Church’s position consciously or unconsciously\".\n\nA few Russian women, such as Ekaterina Zakharova, Natalija Klimova, and Lamara Kelesheva, became grandmothers through post-mortem gestational surrogacy programs, their surrogate grandsons being conceived posthumously after the deaths of their sons.\n\nRegistration of children born through surrogacy is regulated by the Family Code of Russia (art. 51-52) and the Law on Acts on Civil Status (art. 16). A surrogate’s consent is needed for that. Apart from that consent, no adoption nor court decision is required. The surrogate’s name is never listed on the birth certificate.\nThere is no requirement for the child to be genetically related to at least one of the commissioning parents.\n\nChildren born to heterosexual couples who are not officially married or single intended parents through gestational surrogacy are registered in accordance to analogy of jus (art. 5 of the Family Code). A court decision may be needed in that case. On 5 August 2009 a St. Petersburg court definitely resolved a dispute as to whether single women could apply for surrogacy and obliged the State Registration Authority to register a 35-year=old single intended mother, Nataliya Gorskaya, as the mother of her surrogate son.\n\nOn 4 August 2010 a Moscow court ruled that a single man who applied for gestational surrogacy (using donor eggs) could be registered as the only parent of his son, becoming the first man in Russia to defend his right to become a father through court proceedings. The surrogate mother’s name was not listed on the birth certificate; the father was listed as the only parent. After that a few more identical decisions concerning single men who became fathers through surrogacy were issued by different courts in Russia, listing men as the only parents of their surrogate children and confirming that prospective single parents, regardless of their sex or sexual orientation, can exercise their right to parenthood through surrogacy in Russia.\n\nLiberal legislation makes Russia attractive for \"reproductive tourists\" looking for techniques not available in their countries. Intended parents go there for oocyte donation because of advanced age or marital status (single women and single men) and when surrogacy is considered. Foreigners have the same rights for assisted reproduction as Russian citizens. Within 3 days after the birth, the commissioning parents obtain a Russian birth certificate with both their names on it. Genetic relation to the child (in case of donation) does not matter.\n\nReligious authorities in Saudi Arabia do not allow the use of surrogate mothers, instead suggesting medical procedures to restore fertility and ability to deliver.\n\nAll surrogacy arrangements (both commercial and altruistic) are illegal. A draft of the new civil law is said to allow surogacy mother, but Serbian Assembly still did not adopt this law yet. On April 21, 2017, the Serbian Assembly started a discussion a legislation on assisted reproductive technology that bans all forms of surrogacy. (The legislation is being discussed.)\n\nThe South Africa Children's Act of 2005 (which came fully into force in 2010) enabled the \"commissioning parents\" and the surrogate to have their surrogacy agreement validated by the High Court even before fertilization. This allows the commissioning parents to be recognized as legal parents from the outset of the process and helps prevent uncertainty - although if the surrogate mother is the genetic mother she has until 60 days after the birth of the child to change her mind. The law permits single people and gay couples to be commissioning parents. However, only those domiciled in South Africa benefit from the protection of the law, no non-validated agreements will be enforced, and agreements must be altruistic rather than commercial. If there is only one commissioning parent, s/he must be genetically related to the child. If there are two, they must both be genetically related to the child unless that is physically impossible due to infertility or sex (as in the case of a same sex couple). The Commissioning parent or parents must be physically unable to birth a child independently. The surrogate mother must have had at least one pregnancy and viable delivery and have at least one living child. The surrogate mother has the right to unilaterally terminate the pregnancy, but she must consult with and inform the commissioning parents, and if she is terminating for a non-medical reason, may be obliged to refund any medical reimbursements she had received.\n\nAs of mid-2010s, surrogacy was available and mostly unregulated in South Korea. The practice is often morally stigmatized. Surrogacy has declined since mid-2000s, as some aspects of commercial surrogacy became illegal.\n\nWhereas surrogacy is not legal in Spain (the biological mother's renouncement contract is not legally valid), it is legal to perform the surrogacy in a country where it is legal, having the mother the nationality from that same country.\n\nSurrogacy is not clearly regulated in Swedish law. The legal procedure most equivalent to it is making an adoption of the child from the surrogate mother. However, the surrogate mother has the right to keep the child if she changes her mind before the adoption. The biological father may nevertheless claim the right to the child.\n\nIt is illegal for Swedish fertility clinics to make surrogate arrangements. As an alternative, Sweden sanctioned the world's first uterus transplant in an infertile woman. The woman was 36 years old.\n\nSurrogacy is regulated in the \"Bundesgesetz über die medizinisch unterstützte Fortpflanzung (Fortpflanzungsmedizingesetz, FMedG) vom 18. Dezember 1998\" and illegal in Switzerland. Art. 4 forbids surrogacy, Art. 31 regulates the punishment of clinicians who apply in vitro fertilisation for surrogacy or persons who arrange surrogacy. The surrogate mother is not punished by law. She will be the legal mother of the child.\n\nOn 24 August 2014, the Administrative Court of the Canton of St. Gallen granted parentship to two men of a child born in the USA.\n\nIn response to the controversial Baby Gammy incident in 2014, Thailand since July 30, 2015, has banned foreign people travelling to Thailand, to have commercial surrogacy contract arrangement, under the \"Protection of Children Born from Assisted Reproductive Technologies Act\". Only opposite-sex married couples as Thailand residents are allowed to have a commercial surrogacy contract arrangement. In the past Thailand was a popular destination for couples seeking surrogate mothers.\n\nSince 2002, surrogacy and surrogacy in combination with egg/sperm donation has been absolutely legal in Ukraine. According to the law a donor or a surrogate mother has no parental rights over the child born and the child born is legally the child of the prospective parents.\n\nIn Ukraine the start of introduction of methods of supporting reproductive medicine was given in eighties of the preceding century. It was Kharkov where the extracorporeal fertilization method was for the first time successfully applied in Ukraine, and in 1991 a girl named Katy was born. Kharkiv was also the first city in CIS countries to realize surrogacy. Many clinics dealing with surrogacy have been opened in Kiev and Lviv.\n\nUkrainian surrogacy laws are very favorable and fully support the individual's reproductive rights. Surrogacy is officially regulated by Clause 123 of the Family Code of Ukraine and the order of the Ministry of health of Ukraine \"On approval of the application of assisted reproductive technologies in Ukraine\" from 09.09.2013 № 787. You can choose between Gestational Surrogacy, Egg/sperm Donation, special Embryo adoption programs and their combinations. No specific permission from any regulatory body is required for that. A written informed consent of all parties (intended parents and surrogate) participating in the surrogacy program is mandatory.\n\nUkrainian legislation allows intended parents to carry on a surrogacy program and their names will be on Birth certificate of the child born as a result of the surrogacy program from the very beginning. The child is considered to be legally \"belonging\" to the prospective parents from the very moment of conception. The surrogate’s name is never listed on the birth certificate. The surrogate can't keep the child after the birth. Even if a donation program took place and there is no biological relation between the child and the intended mother, their names will be on Birth certificate (Clause 3 of article 123 of the Family Code of Ukraine).\n\nEmbryo research is also allowed, gamete and embryo donation permitted on a commercial level. Single women can be treated by known or anonymous donor insemination. Gestational surrogacy is an option for officially married couples only (a man and a woman). Surrogacy in Ukraine is not regulated in law as commercial, it is more close to altruistic, as the so-called \"payment\" is not performed to the surrogate mother, it is called a compensation and is not under obligation to pay taxes.\n\nCommercial surrogacy arrangements are not legal in the United Kingdom. Such arrangements were prohibited by the Surrogacy Arrangements Act 1985. Whilst it is illegal in the UK to pay more than expenses for a surrogacy, the relationship is recognised under section 30 of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. Regardless of contractual or financial consideration for expenses, surrogacy arrangements are not legally enforceable so a surrogate mother maintains the legal right of determination for the child, even if they are genetically unrelated. Unless a parental order or adoption order is made, the surrogate mother remains the legal mother of the child.\n\nSurrogacy and its attendant legal issues fall under state jurisdiction and the legal situation for surrogacy varies greatly from state to state. Some states have written legislation, while others have developed common law regimes for dealing with surrogacy issues. Some states facilitate surrogacy and surrogacy contracts, others simply refuse to enforce them, and some penalize commercial surrogacy. Surrogacy friendly states tend to enforce both commercial and altruistic surrogacy contracts and facilitate straightforward ways for the intended parents to be recognized as the child's legal parents. Some relatively surrogacy friendly states only offer support for married heterosexual couples. Generally, only gestational surrogacy is supported and traditional surrogacy finds little to no legal support.\n\nStates generally considered to be surrogacy friendly include California, Illinois, Arkansas, Maryland, Washington D.C., Oregon, and New Hampshire among others. Both New Jersey and Washington State commercial surrogacy laws become effective from 1/1/2019.\n\nFor legal purposes, key factors are where the contract is completed, where the surrogate mother resides, and where the birth takes place. Therefore, individuals living in a non-friendly state can still benefit from the policies of surrogacy friendly states by working with a surrogate who lives and will give birth in a friendly state.\n\nArkansas was one of the first states to enact surrogacy friendly laws. In 1989, under then Governor Bill Clinton, it passed Act 647, which states that in a surrogacy arrangement, the biological father and his wife will be recognized as the child's legal parents from birth, even if his wife is not genetically related to the child (i.e., in a traditional surrogacy arrangement). If he is unmarried, he alone will be recognized as the legal parent. A woman may also be recognized as the legal mother of the surrogate birth mother's genetic child as long as that child was conceived with anonymous donor sperm. On the other hand, it is unclear how or whether same sex couples could benefit these laws, since the 2008 ballot measure that made it illegal for unmarried, cohabiting individuals to adopt or provide foster care to minors. On June 26, 2015, the 2008 ballot issue is moot because of Obergefell v. Hodges.\n\nCalifornia is known to be a surrogacy-friendly state. It permits commercial surrogacy, regularly enforces gestational surrogacy contracts, and makes it possible for all intended parents, regardless of marital status or sexual orientation, to establish their legal parentage prior to the birth and without adoption proceedings (pre-birth orders).\n\nMichigan forbids absolutely all surrogacy agreements. It is a felony to enter into such an agreement, punishable by a fine of up to $50,000 and up to five years in prison. The law makes surrogacy agreements unenforceable.\n\nSince 2014, New Hampshire is recognized as a surrogacy friendly state, with laws in place to protect all parties to a surrogacy arrangement. All intended parents, irrespective of marital status, sexual orientation, or a genetic connection to the child, are able to establish their legal parental rights through pre-birth orders placing their names directly on the child's initial birth certificate. Reasonable compensation to the surrogate is permitted by statute.\n\nNew York law holds that commercial surrogacy contracts contravene public policy and provides for civil penalties for those who participate in or facilitate a commercial surrogacy contract in New York. Altruistic surrogacy contracts are not penalized, but neither are they enforced. New York does recognize pre-birth orders from other states, and has provided a post-birth adoption alternative for altruistic surrogate parents via orders of maternal and paternal filiation.\n\nBaby M: New Jersey 1988. The surrogate mother in a gestational surrogacy arrangement decided to keep the resulting child. The intended parents sued to have themselves recognized as the legal parents. The New Jersey Supreme Court found that the surrogacy contract was invalid as a matter of New Jersey public policy. However, the intended parents were given custody of the child because the courts thought they would provide a better home for the baby than the surrogate mother, who was instead given visitation rights.\n\nSurrogacy for humanitarian purposes have been allowed in Vietnam from 2015 after The amended Family and Marriage Law passed with nearly 60 percent of votes from the National Assembly.\n\nUnder the new law, surrogacy will only be allowed among married couples, who do not have any common child, after doctors confirm the wife can not give birth even with technical support. The surrogate must be a relative of either the husband or wife, and have already given birth successfully. A woman is only allowed to be a surrogate once in her life and must produce her husband’s approval if she’s married. The embryo must be created by the intended parents' sperm and ovum. The process must be voluntary and follow in-vitro fertilization regulations.\n"}
{"id": "1503724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1503724", "title": "Tax refund", "text": "Tax refund\n\nA tax refund or tax rebate is a refund on taxes when the tax liability is less than the taxes paid. Taxpayers can often get a tax refund on their income tax if the tax they owe is less than the sum of the total amount of the withholding taxes and estimated taxes that they paid, plus the refundable tax credits that they claim. (Tax refunds are often paid after the end of the tax year.)\n\nAccording to the Internal Revenue Service, 77% of tax returns filed in 2004 resulted in a refund check, with the average refund check being $2,100. In 2011, the average tax refund was $2,913. Taxpayers may choose to have their refund directly deposited into their bank account, have a check mailed to them, or have their refund applied to the following year's income tax. As of 2006, tax filers may split their tax refund with direct deposit in up to three separate accounts with three different financial institutions. This has given taxpayers an opportunity to save and spend some of their refund (rather than only spend their refund). Every year, a number of U.S. taxpayers around the country get tax refunds even if they owe zero income tax. This is due to withholding calculations and the earned income tax credit. Because withholding is calculated on an annualized basis, an individual just entering the work force or unemployed for a long period of time will have more tax than is owed withheld. Refund anticipation loans are a common means to receive a tax refund early, but at the expense of high fees that can reach over 200% annual interest. In the 1990s, refunds could take as long as twelve weeks to come back to the taxpayer; however, the average time for a refund is now six weeks, with refunds from electronically filed returns coming in three weeks.\n\nSome people believe that getting a large tax refund is not as desirable as more accurate withholding throughout the year, as a large refund represents a loan paid back by the government interest-free. Optimally, a return should result in a payment owed of just less than the amount that would cause a penalty charge, which is 100% of the prior year's tax (110% for high income individuals), 90% of the current year's tax, or $1,000 for individuals who have direct withholding and do not pay estimated tax. In order to decrease the amount of the tax refund which has to be received by taxpayers, they can turn to one or several of the following methods:\n\nHowever, some people use the tax refund as a simple \"savings plan\" to get money back each year (even though it is excess money that they paid earlier in the year). Another argument is that it is better to get a refund rather than to owe money, because in the latter case one might find oneself without sufficient funds to make the necessary payment. When properly filled out, the Form W-4 will withhold approximately the correct amount of tax to eliminate a refund or amount owed, assuming the W-4 was filled out at the beginning of the tax year.\n\nA U.S. federal law signed in 1996 contained a provision that required the federal government to make electronic payments by 1999. In 2008, the U.S. Treasury Department paired with Comerica Bank to offer the Direct Express Debit MasterCard prepaid debit card. The card is used to make payments to federal benefit recipients who do not have a bank account. Tax refunds, however, are exempt from the electronic payments requirement. However, many U.S. states send tax refunds in the form of prepaid debit cards to people who do not have bank accounts.\n\nIn New Zealand, income tax is deducted by the employer under the PAYE (Pay As You Earn) tax system. This information is collected and held by the Inland Revenue Department (New Zealand) (IRD) and is not automatically processed. However individual earners can request a summary of earnings to see if they have overpaid or underpaid their tax for each given financial year. To claim a tax refund, a personal tax summary must be filed; this can be done by dealing with the IRD directly or through a Tax Agent. If a personal tax summary is requested in a situation where tax would be owing, a debt is created, so correct calculations prior to this request are important, and these core services are offered by third party Tax Agents. Tax Agents in New Zealand are largely self-regulating, with the Online Tax Association of New Zealand (OTANZ) providing guidance and governing rules for New Zealand's largest 4 tax refund agencies whom serve most of the market for personal tax refunds.\n\nIn India, there is a provision of refund of excess tax along with interest. For claiming a refund one has to file the income tax return within a specified period. However, under Sections 237 and 119(2)(b) of the Income Tax Act, the Chief Commissioner or Commissioner of Income Tax are empowered to condone a delay in the claim of a refund.\n\nProvisions of refund of duty exists in indirect taxation. In Section 11 B of the Central Excises Act, 1944 which is also applicable in the cases of Service Tax (Finance Act, 1994).\n\nIn the United Kingdom, income tax is deducted by the employer under the PAYE (Pay As You Earn) tax system via HMRC. Some refunds such as those due to changing tax codes or similar circumstances will be automatically processed via a P800 form. A change of circumstances, such as a change of employment or second job, sometimes results in overpaid tax which can be claimed back . It is also possible to make more complex claims under both PAYE and self-employment circumstances, for example if employed by the Ministry of Defence or Construction Industry Scheme used by construction trade subcontractors. In such cases tax refunds for various work related expenses can also be claimed for up to the last four tax years; common examples include costs for accommodation (for example for offshore workers staying overnight before transport to a rig), food purchased while travelling between workplaces, or the purchase or hire or specialist equipment.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, income tax is deducted by the employer under the PAYE (Pay As You Earn) tax system. If incorrect tax credits are applied by the employer, then a refund of tax is due. Tax refunds may also be due for income deductions that are applied after the tax year has ended, if one finishes working prior to the year end, or for joint assessment of taxes for a married couple. Tax refunds must be claimed within four years of the end of the tax year if the one is assessed under the PAYE tax system.\n"}

{"id": "10448817", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10448817", "title": "Timber recycling", "text": "Timber recycling\n\nTimber recycling or wood recycling is the process of turning waste timber into usable products. Recycling timber is a practice that was popularized in the early 1990s as issues such as deforestation and climate change prompted both timber suppliers and consumers to turn to a more sustainable timber source. Recycling timber is the environmentally friendliest form of timber production and is very common in countries such as Australia and New Zealand where supplies of old wooden structures are plentiful. Timber can be chipped down into wood chips which can be used to power homes or power plants.\n\nRecycling timber has become popular due to its image as an environmentally friendly product. Common belief among consumers is that by purchasing recycled wood, the demand for \"green timber\" will fall and ultimately benefit the environment. Greenpeace also view recycled timber as an environmentally friendly product, citing it as the most preferable timber source on their website. The arrival of recycled timber as a construction product has been important in both raising industry and consumer awareness towards deforestation and promoting timber mills to adopt more environmentally friendly practices.\n\nRecycling one ton of wood can save 18,000,000 btus of energy \n\nSome hurdles facing the widespread adoption of recycled timber: sometimes the ends of wall studs need to be trimmed off to stop decay and cracking, thus resulting in a shorter piece of wood; this trimming may result in pieces of wood that do not meet building codes. Though the price may be less than for new wood, the process of selecting usable pieces of salvaged wood, pulling out nails, and refinishing for a new use can be laborious and time-consuming. Demolition must happen in such a way as to preserve as much of the timber as possible in a building, which means more time spent dismantling a building rather than just tearing it down quickly. The trade in recycled timber is not well-established everywhere, so a reliable supply of usable wood may be hard to come by for builders. There may be a stigma associated with using \"used\" or \"cheap\" wood that is perceived to be of not as high quality as \"new\" wood. Not all pieces of wood in a dismantled building will fit in a new building, and it may be cheaper and easier, from a design and labor perspective, to simply get new wood (ex: wood from a 6-foot (1.8 m) deck being used in a 7-foot (2.1 m) deck). Of course, none of these issues are insurmountable, and they are issues of convenience and logistics rather than structural integrity, but many builders find it easier and less time-consuming to simply get new wood in standard uniform sizes. \n\nRecycled timber most commonly comes from old buildings, bridges and wharfs, where it is carefully stripped out and put aside by demolishers. At the same time any usable dimension stone is set aside for reuse. The demolishers then sell the salvaged timber to merchants who then re-mill the timber by manually scanning it with a metal detector, which allows the timber to be de-nailed and sawn to size. Once re-milled the timber is commonly sold to consumers in the form of timber flooring, beams and decking.\n\nUse of recycling timber is not new. As early as 1948, the 100 metre tall tower of Golm transmitter near Potsdam, Germany was built from recycled timber. It stood for 31 years.\nIt was common to reuse wood of dismantled radio towers in the 1930s in Germany, e.g. the former tower of Koblenz radio transmitter was built of wood from a dismantled tower, which carried a T-antenna at Transmitter Muehlacker. The upper parts of the 157-metre-tall wood tower of Ismaning radio transmitter, which stood for 49 years, were built of wood from a smaller radio tower dismantled in 1934.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a law which is usually ignored by law enforcement, therefore such laws have no consequences. Some people have criticized such laws claiming that it indicates sometimes the law means what it says, sometimes it doesn't.\n\nThe law may be put in place simply for symbolic reasons, but without actual prosecutions taking place. For example speeding is illegal, but patrol officers usually ignore motorists who are 5-10 miles an hour over the legal limit. Automate ticketing systems like computerized cameras will still issue fines in these circumstances in some but not all US states.\n\nAlthough incest is illegal in many European countries, it is generally not enforced if between two consenting adults. \n\nLaws that are symbolic typically attempt to persuade rather than enforce, punish or prevent. An example was adultery in the US state of Colorado, where it was prohibited by law (since repealed), but was not punishable in any way. In Maryland adultery is prohibited by law with just a $10 fine, but not punishable by imprisonment.\n\n"}

American Bell Telephone Co.\n\nUnited States v. Bell Telephone Co., 167 U.S. 224 (1897), is an 1897 decision of the United States Supreme Court that held that the United States lacked standing to challenge the validity of its issued patents “on the mere ground of error of judgment” in issuing them. The United States had standing to seek to invalidate patents, however, on grounds of fraudulent procurement and also as a defense to a charge of patent infringement. The decision operated for many decades as a bar to government efforts to seek invalidation of patents that it considered spurious until the Supreme Court limited \"Bell Telephone\", first to a limited extent in \"United States v. United States Gypsum Co.\", and then more broadly in \"United States v. Glaxo Group Ltd.\"\n\nOn February 1, 1893, the United States filed in the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Massachusetts a bill in equity against the American Bell Telephone Company and Emile Berliner, praying a decree to set aside and cancel U.S. patent No. 463,569, issued on November 17, 1891, to Bell as assignee of the inventor Berliner. According to the opinion in the case:\nThe application by Berliner was made on June 4, 1877, he having filed a caveat on April 14, 1877. In 1878, and prior to October 23, the telephone company purchased Berliner's invention, and on November 17, 1891, a patent was issued to the telephone company, as assignee of Berliner. The application was therefore pending in the department fourteen years, during thirteen of which the invention was the property of the telephone company.\nThe government made two allegations on which the circuit court passed:\n\nUpon amended pleadings and proofs, the circuit court on January 3, 1895, 65 F. 86, entered a decree as prayed for in favor of the United States. On appeal to the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, this decree was on May 18, 1895, reversed, and a decree entered directing a dismissal of the bill. 68 F. 542. Thereupon the United States took an appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Court's majority opinion, by Justice Brewer, began by noting that this was the first case by the United States \"to set aside a patent for an invention as wrongfully issued.\" There were prior cases as to land patents, however, and the Court looked to them for guidance. \nThese cases required \"clear, convincing, and unambiguous\" evidence from the government to overcome \"the presumption that all the preceding steps required by the law had been observed before its issue, [given] the immense importance and necessity of the stability of titles dependent upon these official instruments.\"\n\nApplying this principle to the government's first argument, the Court asked what caused the thirteen years of delay—\"It may have been caused either by the negligent or wrongful action of the officers of the department, and without any connivance, assistance, or concurrence on the part of the applicant, or it may have been brought about by the applicant, either through its corruption of the public officers or through other misconduct on its part.\" The Court said that the burden was on the government to prove bribery or other misconduct to cause delay, and no evidence of that was in the record. The government's only evidence was of \"the supine submission of the company to such extraordinary delay.\" The Court said that the patent officials could have acted more expeditiously, but there is no evidence that \"they acted wrongfully, and [that] their action was induced by or at the instance of the defendants.\" Therefore, the government's first argument failed.\n\nAs for the second argument—double patenting—the Court said the patent office had made a determination on that point that \"was adverse to the [present] contention of the government, and such judgment cannot be reviewed in this suit.\" The reason was the government lacked standing to litigate that issue:\n\n[W]hen it has no proprietary or pecuniary result in the setting aside of the patent, is not seeking to discharge its obligations to the public, when it has brought the suit simply to help an individual, making itself, as it were, the instrument by which the right of that individual against the patentee can be established—then it becomes subject to the rules governing like suits between private litigants.\n\nTo be sure: \"Doubtless the removal from the public of the burden of a monopoly charged to have been wrongfully created was also one of the objects, and perhaps the principal object.\" But the patent law gives the patent office exclusive power to determine whether to issue a patent. \"[T]he argument is a forcible one that such determination[s] should be held conclusive upon the government.\" The United States may sue to cancel a patent procured by fraud, but this is not such a case. \"Least of all was it intended . . . that the courts of the United States, sitting as courts of equity, could entertain jurisdiction of a suit by the United States to set aside a patent for an invention on the mere ground of error of judgment on the part of the patent officials.\"\n\nJustice Harlan dissented without opinion.\n\nIn \"United States v. United States Gypsum Co.\", the Supreme Court recognized that \"Bell Telephone\" held that the United States was \"without standing to bring a suit in equity to cancel a patent on the ground of invalidity,\" but went on to declare that, to vindicate the public interest in enjoining violations of the Sherman Act, the United States is entitled to attack the validity of patents relied upon to justify anticompetitive conduct otherwise violative of the law. Specifically, if a patentee defended price-fixing on the ground that it was permissible under the 1926 \"General Electric\" case, the government could overcome that defense by showing the patent was invalid.\n\nIn \"United States v. Glaxo Group Ltd.\", the government showed that the defendants used their patent power to secure restrictive patent licenses that violated the antitrust laws. Then, the government sought a declaration that the patents were invalid and as relief compulsory licensing of the patents and mandatory sales of the patented product, on reasonable terms. The district court refused the relief, accepting the defendants' arguments that the government would \"deny defendants an essential ingredient of their rights under the patent system,\" and that there was no warrant for \"such a drastic forfeiture of their rights.\" The district court cited \"Bell Telephone\" as authority for the government's lack of standing to challenge patent validity. The Supreme Court reversed. Whether the patents were valid or invalid could significantly affect what remedies were appropriate. It held:\nIn this context, where the court would necessarily be dealing with the future enforceability of the patents, we think it would have been appropriate, if it appeared that the Government's claims for further relief were substantial, for the court to have also entertained the Government's challenge to the validity of those patents.\n"}

Ninety-Five Barrels Alleged Apple Cider Vinegar\n\nUnited States v. Ninety-Five Barrels Alleged Apple Cider Vinegar, 265 U.S. 438 (1924), was an \"in rem\" case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that apple cider vinegar is mislabeled when that vinegar is made from dried apples. The label at issue indicated that the vinegar was made from \"selected\" apples. Douglas Packing Company, the manufacturer, admitted to dehydrating fresh apples and then re-hydrating the apples with pure water to produce vinegar.\n\nAdditional chemicals were used in the manufacturing process for vinegar made from dried apples, but neither party alleged that this affected the vinegar. Other than this and the difference in apples, the manufacturing process was the same. The trial judge, who tried samples of the vinegar at issue and apple cider vinegar made from fresh apples, concluded that there were only slight differences in appearance and taste. Chemical comparison yielded similar results for both liquids.\n\nThere was no claim that vinegar from dried apples was of inferior quality. However, the court found first that the dried apple vinegar was not identical to vinegar as commonly understood—that produced from fresh ingredients. Second, fresh apples contain the apple juice that is normally used in the production of apple cider vinegar, whereas Douglas Packing used water as a substitute ingredient. Finally, the court found that \"made from selected apples\" misled the reader into thinking that the apples were fresh instead of dried. These three issues—an imitation under the same name, false or misleading ingredient listing, and misleading labelling—were all a part of the Pure Food and Drug Act section defining \"misbranded\". For this reason, the Supreme Court found that the apple cider was misbranded under the statute.\n\n\n"}

Kilroy-Silk served as party leader from formation, through the 2005 General Election, until his resignation in July that year. He was succeeded by Patrick Eston, who resigned the leadership on 15 June 2008 citing frustrations of his efforts to reform the party. The party merged into the English Democrats in June 2015.\n\nVeritas had no representation in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, although it had members serve in the European Parliament and the London Assembly, elected as UKIP members and defecting upon Veritas' formation. At the time of its merger, the party had not put forward General Election candidates since 2005.\n\nRobert Kilroy-Silk, a former Labour shadow cabinet member and television presenter, was elected as a UKIP Member of the European Parliament in the 2004 European Parliament election for the East Midlands region. His ambition to attain the leadership of that party was announced in October 2004, but it proved very unpopular within the party. Instead of risking disciplinary action for continuing this action, Kilroy-Silk resigned the party whip, while remaining a full member and asserting his continued challenge. The plan ultimately failed, and Kilroy-Silk finally resigned from the party – as had been long expected – on 20 January 2005. Rumours circulated immediately that Kilroy-Silk was set to form his own party, fuelled by the registration of the domain name \"veritasparty.com\" a month earlier. An earlier rumour suggested that he had been in negotiations with the English Democrats to join and lead their party.\n\n\"Veritas\" – Latin for \"truth\" – was officially founded in a press conference on 2 February, during which Kilroy-Silk proclaimed \"unlike the old parties, we shall be honest, open and straight\", devoid of the other parties' \"lies and spin\". There were a number of defections from UKIP to the new party. They included UKIP London Assembly member Damian Hockney, who became deputy leader.\n\nAt the time of formation, its primary policy was opposition to immigration to the United Kingdom. It was perceived to be more specific than UKIP's general euroscepticism, and almost to the point of Veritas being labelled a single-issue party. Kilroy-Silk also proposed support for the introduction of flat tax in opposition to the existing system of income tax bands varying with income. Kilroy-Silk's preferred figure was 22%, the \"basic rate\" band in which most UK citizens fell at the time.\n\nThe party was immediately lambasted as nothing more than a vanity vehicle for Kilroy-Silk, and was nicknamed \"Vanitas\" by former allies.\nThe first test of Veritas' ambitions was the general election on 5 May 2005 where it had hoped to overtake UKIP as the primary party opposing the European Union. Although \"The Times\" newspaper had suggested that Veritas hoped to run candidates in every constituency in Great Britain, the party ended up fielding 65 candidates in England and Wales, polling 40,481 votes, an average of 623 (1.5%).\n\nKilroy-Silk contested the constituency of Erewash in Derbyshire. He came fourth with 2,957 votes (5.8%); Liz Blackman was elected for Labour with 22,472. No Veritas candidates were elected; Kilroy-Silk was the only one to save his deposit.\n\nIn the subsequent Cheadle by-election on 14 July 2005 Les Leggett of Veritas polled 218 votes (0.6%).\n\nIn the wake of the poor showing in the general election, it was reported that there were many resignations from the party. Some discontented party members came to oppose Kilroy-Silk and formed the Veritas Members Association (VMA). One of its founders, Ken Wharton, challenged Kilroy-Silk for the leadership on 12 July 2005, during the Cheadle by-election campaign but his challenge faltered due to ill health. Kilroy-Silk resigned as party leader on 29 July. In a press statement he said \"It was clear from the general election result – and more recently that of the Cheadle by-election – that the electors are content with the old parties and that it would be virtually impossible for a new party to make a significant impact given the nature of our electoral system. We tried and failed\". Further resignations included that of his chief-of-staff David Soutter and deputy leader Damian Hockney. Hockney and London Assembly Veritas representative Peter Hulme-Cross (who, like Hockney, had defected from UKIP) subsequently formed the One London party.\n\nA leadership election was held in September 2005. Acting leader Patrick Eston defeated Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Colin Brown, and former boxer Winston McKenzie on a 22% turnout. This, combined with a poor turnout at the party's first Annual General Meeting, is believed to have brought about the subsequent resignation of Brown and the founders of the VMA. Eston appointed a new party chairman, Alan Ainscow, who resigned from that post and the party in November. As defections and resignations continued, a number of members and former members from Veritas and UKIP, including Anthony Bennett and Ken Wharton, formed a new party, the Popular Alliance in March 2006. Eston appointed a deputy, Howard Martin, who also is the main Veritas Party spokesperson, and seemed determined to continue with the party, despite the depletion of the Veritas membership.\n\nIn the 2006 local elections, Veritas stood four candidates: two each in Kingston-upon-Hull and Bolton. They polled an average of 98 votes each (3.5% of the total). In the 2007 elections, Veritas stood three candidates: two in English council elections and one – Iain James Sheldon in the Mid and West Wales Region for the Welsh Assembly, who received 502 votes (0.2% of the total).\n\nIn the summer of 2007, Patrick Eston contacted the leadership of other parties with similar political positions with a view to organising a meeting to discuss co-operation. While all parties were being contacted a later meeting was being arranged for September between Eston and the leaders of the Freedom Party and United Kingdom Popular Democrats who had shown interest. On 15 June 2008 Patrick Eston announced that he could not take the Veritas Party in the direction he wanted and so would be resigning the party leadership. In a resignation letter to the party membership he said:\n\nTherese Muchewicz, Party Secretary, served as Acting Leader until leadership elections in October 2008.

The enactment of the Slave Codes is considered to be the consolidation of slavery in Virginia, and served as the foundation of Virginia's slave legislation.\n\nThese codes effectively embedded the idea of white supremacy into law by the following devices:\nThese new laws exhibited a grand departure from business as it once was, stripping from blacks many previously held rights. Before this, indentured servants, while they served their term, and slaves were almost equals in their plight. Now, a racial divide was a legal mandate. \n\nHistorians generally agree that this law was devised to establish a greater level of control over the surging African slave population of Virginia. It also served to socially segregate white colonists from black slaves making them disparate groups hindering their ability to unite. A unity of the commoners was a perceived fear of the Virginia aristocracy which had to be addressed, and who wished to prevent a repeat of events such as Bacon's Rebellion, occurring 29 years prior.\n\n"}

Jonas Yoder, 406 U.S. 205 (1972), is the case in which the United States Supreme Court found that Amish children could not be placed under compulsory education past 8th grade. The parents' fundamental right to freedom of religion was determined to outweigh the state's interest in educating its children. The case is often cited as a basis for parents' right to educate their children outside of traditional private or public schools.\n\nThree Amish students from three different families stopped attending the New Glarus High School in the New Glarus, Wisconsin, school district at the end of the eighth grade because of their parents' religious beliefs. The three families were represented by Jonas Yoder (one of the fathers involved in the case) when the case went to trial. They were convicted in the Green County Court. Each defendant was fined the nominal sum of $5. Thereafter the Wisconsin Supreme Court found in Yoder's favor. Thereupon, Wisconsin appealed that ruling in the US Supreme Court.\n\nThe Amish did not believe in going to court to settle disputes but instead follow the biblical command to \"turn the other cheek.\" Thus, the Amish are at a disadvantage when it comes to defending themselves in courts or before legislative committees. However, a Lutheran minister, Reverend William C. Lindholm, took an interest in Amish legal difficulties from a religious freedom perspective and founded The National Committee for Amish Religious Freedom (partly as a result of this case) and then provided them with legal counsel.\n\nUnder Amish church standards, higher education was deemed not only unnecessary for their simple way of life, but also endangering to their salvation. These men appealed for exemption from compulsory education on the basis of these religious convictions. They sincerely held to the belief that the values their children would learn at home would surpass the worldly knowledge taught in school.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of \"Yoder\" in its decision. Justice William O. Douglas filed a partial dissent, but voted with the court regarding Yoder's case. Justices Lewis F. Powell, Jr. and William H. Rehnquist took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.\n\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court \"sustained respondents' claim that application of the compulsory school-attendance law to them violated their rights under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court held as follows:\n\n\nJustice William O. Douglas, who dissented in part, wrote:\nI agree with the Court that the religious scruples of the Amish are opposed to the education of their children beyond the grade schools, yet I disagree with the Court's conclusion that the matter is within the dispensation of parents alone. The Court's analysis assumes that the only interests at stake in the case are those of the Amish parents on the one hand, and those of the State on the other. The difficulty with this approach is that, despite the Court's claim, the parents are seeking to vindicate not only their own free exercise claims, but also those of their high-school-age children...\n\nOn this important and vital matter of education, I think the children should be entitled to be heard. While the parents, absent dissent, normally speak for the entire family, the education of the child is a matter on which the child will often have decided views. He may want to be a pianist or an astronaut or an oceanographer. To do so he will have to break from the Amish tradition.\n\nIt is the future of the students, not the future of the parents, that is imperiled by today's decision. If a parent keeps his child out of school beyond the grade school, then the child will be forever barred from entry into the new and amazing world of diversity that we have today. The child may decide that that is the preferred course, or he may rebel. It is the student's judgment, not his parents', that is essential if we are to give full meaning to what we have said about the Bill of Rights and of the right of students to be masters of their own destiny. If he is harnessed to the Amish way of life by those in authority over him and if his education is truncated, his entire life may be stunted and deformed. The child, therefore, should be given an opportunity to be heard before the State gives the exemption which we honor today.\n\nThe ruling is cited as a basis for allowing people to be educated outside traditional private or public schools, such as with homeschooling.\n\nThe implications of the case for the Amish were characterized by one author as:\nSince \"Wisconsin v. Yoder,\" all states must grant the Old Order Amish the right to establish their own schools (should they choose) or to withdraw from public institutions after completing eighth grade. In some communities Amish parents have continued to send their children to public elementary schools even after \"Wisconsin v. Yoder\". In most places tensions eased considerably after the Supreme Court ruling, although certain difficulties remained for those Amish living in Nebraska. \n\n\n"}
