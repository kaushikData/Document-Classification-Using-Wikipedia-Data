{"id": "24614046", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24614046", "title": "Australian Digital Alliance", "text": "Australian Digital Alliance\n\nThe Australian Digital Alliance (ADA) is an Australian non-profit coalition of public and private sector interests, formed to promote balanced copyright law by providing a voice for the public interest perspective in debates about copyright change and reform. The ADA engages with government through submissions, lobbying, and media activities.\n\nThe ADA works closely with its sister organisation, the Australian Libraries Copyright Committee (ALCC). The ALCC is the main consultative body and policy forum for the discussion of copyright issues affecting Australian libraries. It develops policy and advocates action appropriate for the role of libraries as information providers and preservers in Australia. The two bodies share a copyright adviser, and generally make joint submissions to government.\n\nThe Nine Network sued IceTV for copyright infringement after IceTV used parts of Nine Network’s programme schedules for its electronic program guide. The case raised questions about the threshold of the originality requirement for copyright, and the nature of the protection for compilations (collections of facts) in Australia.\n\nThe ADA was granted leave by the High Court of Australia to intervene as a friend of the court. The ADA’s submissions outlined the importance of public interest considerations and the implications that this case could have on copyright users.\n\nThe High Court found in favour of IceTV, with the joint judgment of Gummow, Hayne and Heydon making reference to the ADA’s submissions. The High Court recognised the importance of maintaining a robust public domain which allows people and organisations to use, re-use and build on materials to produce innovative new works.\n\nTogether with the ALCC, the ADA produced a handbook on the new flexible dealing provision of the Copyright Act (section 200AB). The handbook outlines how the provision operates and provides examples to assist libraries, archives, galleries and educational institutions to take advantage of the provision and use copyright materials.\n\nThe formal launch of the handbook was attended by ADA members, senior public servants, and other copyright figures. The Flexible Dealing Handbook is available for free download under Creative Commons license.\n\nSignificantly increased intermediary responsibility, among other things, is currently the subject of negotiations in the proposed Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). The ADA encouraged greater transparency by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) regarding the progress of its negotiations.\n\nThe ADA formed a coalition with other concerned organisations including Choice, the Australian Library and Information Association, and the Internet Industry Association. The coalition was involved in a number of government meetings, and submitted a joint statement of principles for ACTA negotiations to DFAT.\n\nThe submission agreed that reducing counterfeiting is important where it endangers consumer health or safety, or constitutes commercial scale infringement. However, the coalition urged that pursuit of that goal should not threaten legitimate commercial, social, innovative and creative activities, the rights of consumers or the free flow of information. The coalition noted the current proposed treaty raised concerns with respect to transparency, increased customs search powers, increased penalties for IP infringement, and lack of due process.\n\n"}
{"id": "13556853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13556853", "title": "Basilika", "text": "Basilika\n\nThe Basilika was a collection of laws completed c. 892 AD in Constantinople by order of the Byzantine Emperor Leo VI the Wise during the Macedonian dynasty. This was a continuation of the efforts of his father, Basil I, to simplify and adapt the Emperor Justinian I's \"Corpus Juris Civilis\" code of law issued between 529 and 534 which had become outdated. The term \"Basilika\" comes not from the Emperor Basil's name, but rather from meaning \"Royal Laws\".\n\nMany changes had taken place within the Byzantine Empire in between Justinian and Leo VI's reign, chiefly the change in language. During Justinian's era, Latin was still in common use and Court documents were written in it. However, by the 9th century the use of Latin was obsolete, which in turn made the \"Corpus Juris Civilis\" code hard to use for Greek speakers. Furthermore, many of the laws within the \"Corpus Juris Civilis\" no longer pertained to most people, and new laws rose up to take their place. This necessitated an overhaul of the Byzantine legal system. \"Justinian's Codex\" had effectively ended juristic developments for the next couple of centuries. Moreover, the Byzantine legal system operated as a codified system, wherein the sentence given by a judge needed to be grounded in a passage of law previously issued by a legislator. This made it impossible for a judge to set precedents. There was vast confusion amongst judges as to which legal documents they should refer to (\"Justinian's Codex\" or other books of law which had been written in the ensuing centuries). Additionally, \"Justinian's Codex\" had officially stripped the legislative branch of its authority, making it hard for judges to know which law codes they should adhere to. With a code of law in Greek, lawyers were able to use it in their cases, making its practicality invaluable. This was a stark contrast to the \"Corpus Juris\", which proved to be too complex and comprehensive to be used practicably even within its own time.\n\nThe \"Basilika\" also presents itself as a connection back to earlier times before the period of Iconoclasm, lending the Macedonian dynasty a sense of religious legitimacy. This began with Basil I and his desire to distance himself from the Iconoclasts, and to connect himself and his sons with their Great Predecessor, Justinian I.\n\nThe sixty books of the \"Basilika\" have had a profound impact on the scholarship of the Byzantine Empire because they preserved many legal documents. Within the sixty books of law, in addition to the preservation of \"Justinian's Codex\", new legal customs were also included which had evolved in the centuries. It also included works of law initiated by Basil I, including the \"Prochiron\" (a handbook of civil laws and customs which excluded those no longer in use) and the \"Epanagoge\" (an expanded \"Prochiron\" which included an introduction and summary) as well as numerous decrees of the Iconoclast Emperors. However, the Code still followed the tradition of the \"Corpus Juris\", beginning with ecclesiastical law, sources of law, procedure, private law, administrative law, and criminal law.\n\nIt greatly differed however in its use of commentaries (scholia), which were pieces of juristic works from the sixth and seventh centuries as well as the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Previously, Justinian I had outlawed commentary on his set of laws, making the scholia on the \"Basilika\" unique. The actual format of the books themselves vary greatly. Some are represented in one manuscript, which may or may not contain scholia or full parts of other juristic works which have been mentioned. Likewise, some books have been lost entirely.\n\nUnlike Justinian's Codex which continued to have an impact in the West as the continuation of Roman Law, the \"Basilika\"'s influence was limited to the Eastern Empire. This included having a lasting impact on Greece's modern law code. Following the Greek War of Independence against Turkey in 1821, the \"Basilika\" was adopted for thirteen years before the present Civil Code of Greece (\"Hexabiblos\") was adopted. This long continuation of Roman influenced Byzantine law presents a stark contrast to the legal system of the West.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6496673", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6496673", "title": "British and Irish Legal Information Institute", "text": "British and Irish Legal Information Institute\n\nThe British and Irish Legal Information Institute (BAILII, pronounced \"Bailey\") provides legal information, and especially reports of cases decided by courts, in the United Kingdom generally. Decisions from England and Wales, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland, the European Union, and from the European Court of Human Rights are put online. It is a partial online database of British and Irish legislation, case law, law reform reports, treaties and some legal scholarship.\n\nTraditionally, legal information was accessible through a law report, usually written by private individuals or groups. While court judgments have had official reports more recently, historically a court judgment would simply be spoken, and so publication of the precedents built up depended on their record by interested third parties. The Year Books, which recorded judgments from 1268 to 1535, were probably compiled by law students. Other people, like the judge Sir Edward Coke from 1572 to 1615, then created their own series of reports. These would not necessarily be an accurate record of what was said. What was recorded might have been selective, or inaccurate. As the reporting industry developed, more people became involved and specialised in particular areas of law. The Incorporated Council of Law Reporting was created in 1885, and released copies of various cases. There still could be gaps in reporting however. With the advent of the Internet, it was possible to access multiple databases for a fee online, particularly Westlaw or Lexis. However a freely available source had not yet been made.\n\nBAILII was set up after a long and hard campaign by various activists including senior members of the Society for Computers & Law, such as then-Chairman Neil Cameron, barrister Laurie West-Knights QC, Lord Saville and Lord Justice Brooke, who were concerned about the lack of availability of court judgments to ordinary court users and were inspired by the Australasian Legal Information Institute (AustLII) LII. The aim was to provide free access to publicly available legal information. In 2006, BAILII included 5 jurisdictions' fourteen databases.\nThe BAILII website is jointly hosted by the Institute of Advanced Legal Studies, University of London and the University College Cork's Law school\n\nBailii uses a \"neutral citation\" method, which was quickly adopted as a standard for citation of cases. The different series of cases that Bailii produces are as follows.\n\nBAILII has received criticisms due to the restrictions it imposes on its usage: in a \"Guardian\" editorial, it was noted that BAILII had \"done a wonderful job of making case law freely accessible to lawyers\", including \"historic and European data that is otherwise very difficult to find.\" However, it was also noted that as a small charity the service \"struggles to afford to host its 297,000 judgments, and does not allow search engines to index them. In some instances it is not even clear whether the crown or the judge concerned holds the copyright to the words, and reproducing them on any other site is forbidden.\" \n\nAn organization known as Judgmental had been established to scrape information from BAILII and make it indexable by search engines. Founding members of Judgmental included Francis Irving, one of the developers of TheyWorkForYou. Judgmental shut down under threat of legal action regarding the court records for a libel case. \n\nFormer BAILII chairman Henry Brooke defended criticisms, stating that the restrictions on indexing were to ensure that records could be retroactively edited or removed for clerical or legal reasons, such as errors, information that was not authorized to be published, or records that have not been properly anonymized. Brooke went on to explain that BAILII \"[does] not consider that taking the extra step of making the judgments searchable, using Google or other search engines, is necessary in order to achieve the primary objective of making judgments of the courts freely available to the public.\" He also stated that the restriction on redistribution was to protect its \"value-added content\", such as \"converting it into a suitable format and making efforts to prevent the publication of material that must not be published.\"\n\nMuch of the material available on BAILII is duplicated elsewhere, for example legislation and rulings of some courts (such as the Supreme Court). BAILII has an agreement with the Ministry of Justice indemnifying it from some legal prosecutions. BAILII has historically received payment as part of this contract. In the 2010/2011 tax year BAILII received as part of this contract.\n\n"}

These products were released in the VHS, Laserdisc, and Betamax home video formats.\n\nThe company was based in Farmington Hills, Michigan (home of its predecessor Magnetic Video) until 1985, when it moved to Livonia, Michigan. In 1989, it moved its headquarters to New York City, where it stayed until it became Fox Video (now 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment) in 1991.\n\nCBS/Fox Video was founded under a 50-50 venture with 20th Century Fox in 1982 when CBS broke off a previous venture formed in 1980 with MGM. During this period, both companies continued to operate independently while maintaining their partnership. A reorganization occurred in 1990 with CBS selling products under the CBS Video name (which had been sparingly used since the 1970s) and mainstream Fox titles being controlled by FoxVideo; the change was enacted in 1991. In the early 2000s, CBS/Fox ceased operations. Since CBS/Fox disbanded, their film rights have been brought by 20th Century Fox and CBS merged with Viacom.\n\nBefore CBS/Fox Video existed, 20th Century Fox Video released a select few titles for rental only, including \"Dr. No\", \"A Fistful of Dollars\", \"Rocky\", \"Taps\", \"For Your Eyes Only\" and \"Star Wars\". While sale tapes were in big boxes that were later used by CBS/Fox in its early years, Video Rental Library tapes were packaged in black clamshell cases. Similar approaches were taken by Fotomat, Columbia Pictures Home Entertainment, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment, Warner Home Video, and MGM/CBS Home Video around that time.\n\nFoxVideo, Inc. was the home video arm of 20th Century Fox that replaced CBS/Fox Video, which was founded in 1982 after CBS Home Video left MGM Home Video (MGM/CBS Home Video from 1979 to 1982) when United Artists merged with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1981 to form MGM/UA Entertainment Co. (1981–1986, renamed MGM/UA Communications Co. in 1986 after ending that year's only deal with Turner Broadcasting System) and its video arm.\n\nIn 1982, CBS formed a 50-50 venture with 20th Century Fox after Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer broke off a joint venture with CBS, that was agreed in 1980, to market videocassettes and videodiscs. This was publicly announced on June 18, 1982, where they announced CBS's 40-acre film and production facility in Studio City, California would be operated by both companies. In the process, CBS and Fox continued to independently supply programs for the home video market, while CBS/Fox supplied films from motion picture studios.\n\nIn 1985, CBS/Fox became the American licensee of BBC Video products. CBS/Fox brought large amounts of film libraries such as the United Artists films. The library brought consisted mainly of pre-MGM merger titles (although at the time, MGM holds the video rights to some pre-merger films that are not yet released on video), films from the James Bond and Rocky series, although the post-merger Bond and Rocky 1980s sequels were released by CBS/Fox as well, and some low profile post-merger films under license from MGM/UA. These UA films were later issued through MGM/UA Home Video (now, MGM Home Entertainment) starting in 1989 (although Fox would later release the post-April 1986 MGM library years later). CBS/Fox also secured rights from George Lucas for the video release of \"The Empire Strikes Back\" for $12 million on August 30, 1984. Lucas claimed the deal was to prevent the film from being broadcast on television.\n\nIn 1985, CBS and 20th Century Fox secured a financial package that saw both companies generate between $75 and $100 million. The deal also included the offering of bonds with the investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert.\n\nOn December 31, 1987, CBS/Fox's home video rights to the a.a.p. library reverted to Ted Turner. At the time, the a.a.p. and pre-May 1986 MGM film and television libraries were purchased by Turner after its short-lived ownership of MGM/UA, which resulted in the formation of Turner Entertainment Co. In 1987, the company increased its rights from BBC Video after buying the rights to 600 broadcasts. When asked about how the agreement came to light, then-CBS/Fox president Leonard White said \"The deal is timed to coincide with the BBC's 50th anniversary\". Within a month of the announcement, CBS/Fox released a definitive line-up of films named \"Five Star Collection IV\" which included 28 films. Such films included \"Revenge of the Nerds\", \"Cat's Eye\" and \"Oxford Blues\".\n\nIn 1989, CBS/Fox lost the home video rights to the Lorimar library to Warner Home Video, after Warner Communications (which merged with Time Inc. that year to form Time Warner) purchased Lorimar. In November of that year, the company filed a lawsuit against MGM/UA over a video distribution agreement that was broken. The claim was that CBS/Fox lost revenue after video releases ended up being films that did not perform well in cinemas while MGM/UA distributed higher-grossing films. The two companies were placed in a bad relationship since 1981 when MGM/UA brought United Artists which created its own video subsidiary. The case was settled on June 26, 1992, when both companies resolved their differences.\n\nIn 1990–1991, CBS/Fox began releasing titles from the then bankrupt Media Home Entertainment. At the end of 1990, CBS/Fox reported they controlled 6.5% of the home video market and reported revenues of $249 million.\n\nIn March 1991, a reorganization of the company was made, which would give Fox greater control of the joint venture. All of CBS/Fox's distribution functions were transferred to the newly formed FoxVideo, which would also take over exclusive distribution to all 20th Century Fox products. CBS began releasing their products under the \"CBS Video\" name, with CBS/Fox handing marketing and FoxVideo handling distribution. CBS/Fox would retain the license to non-theatrical products from third parties, including those from BBC Video.\n\nIn 1992, ABC Sports and CBS/Fox agreed to a collaboration that allowed men's fragrance company Drakkar Noir to promote their products on a nationwide scale on television. The advertisements cost Drakkar Noir in excess of $1.3 million, which included footage from ABC's \"The Thrill of Victory\" and CBS/Fox's \"The Agony of Defeat\".\n\nIn 1993, CBS/Fox broadened its appeal to include gay audiences with the release of \"The Lost Language of Cranes\", a BBC production that was shown on PBS in 1992. Video rental stores took advantage of a gay and lesbian audience, which was a small demographic.\n\nIn 1995, CBS/Fox secured a 10-year agreement that would allow the company to distribute On Ice's Inc. production of \"Nutcracker on Ice\" that was aired by NBC on January 1, 1996.\n\n20th Century Fox Home Entertainment was founded in 1995. Fox then had 3 video arms during that era. In 1998, CBS/Fox Video folded into CBS Home Entertainment (CBS and the original Viacom had merged in 1970. Paramount Pictures was also a division of Gulf + Western [renamed Paramount Communications in 1989] from 1966–1994. Since Viacom bought Paramount in 1994, Paramount Home Media Distribution distributed CBS Home Entertainment titles), FVI, and TCFHE. FVI eventually folded into TCFHE in 1999.\n\nIn early 1998, Fox Entertainment Group (then-owned by News Corporation) acquired CBS/Fox Video and the rest of CBS/Fox's non-shopping (film and TV) assets, and renamed CBS/Fox Video to 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment.\n\nIn May 1998, CBS/Fox released \"\" and \"Our Friend, Martin\". In 2000, CBS's merger with Viacom was finalized, and the CBS/Fox partnership ceased existence, although even after the corporate split CBS/Fox did still own some ancillary rights to two Rodgers and Hammerstein film properties, \"Oklahoma!\" and \"South Pacific\", until 20th Century Fox was able to fully assume CBS/Fox's former share of these films. The BBC's license with CBS/Fox ended in Summer 2000 and Warner Home Video took over distribution.\n\nCBS/Fox used specialty labels for children's and family's videos, music videos, and sports videos. In addition to its main CBS/Fox label, which was mostly A-list fare, (although the three \"Porky's\", first \"Bachelor Party\" (1984) and first two \"Revenge of the Nerds\" (1984 & 1987) movies with their low budgets and concepts and mostly young or unknown casts were also released on it), CBS/Fox maintained two other labels, Key Video (mostly B and drive-in fare and some made for television films, plus some of the a.a.p./United Artists back catalogue and low-profile TriStar, MGM/UA and Fox releases); and Playhouse Video (children's and family films and programs, including \"Planet of the Apes\" 1968-1973 films, Shirley Temple's films, The Muppets videos, Mr. Rogers videos, and Dr. Seuss specials by DePatie-Freleng Enterprises); this label was also used on the earliest \"Doctor Who\" VHS releases. These became inactive by 1991, though 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment reactivated the Key Video label as Key DVD.\n\nIn the attempt to prevent unauthorized tape duplication, CBS/Fox became an early adopter of Macrovision anti-piracy technology. In countries such as Australia, the company introduced a colored spine that was either yellow or blue on VHS tapes. On Betamax cassettes, a polarized seal was present. These measures were taken to ensure that consumers would be guaranteed that their products were of high quality.\n\n"}

The document – the title of which deliberately echoes the Czechoslovak human rights declaration Charter 77 20 years earlier – was created on the anniversary of a referendum held in 1996, and which, in the words of the organisation of the same name, declares:\n\n\"devotion to the principles of independence, freedom and democracy, respect to the human rights, solidarity with everybody, who stands for elimination of dictatorial regime and restoration of democracy in Belarus\".\n\nBelarusian journalist Pavel Sheremet acted as the group's spokesman at the declaration's public launch.\n\nCharter 97, as a citizens' human rights organisation based on the principles outlined in this document, is a non-partisan organisation which has organised protest rallies and has provided a springboard for other democratic movements in the country. It also maintains a website of news with a focus on human rights developments. The site's editor-in-chief, Natalya Radina, received the 2011 International Press Freedom Award, \"an annual recognition of courageous journalism\", for her work.\n\nOn 3 September 2010, the body of the founder of Charter 97, Aleh Byabenin, was found in his house near Minsk. According to initial statements by the Belarusian government, Bebenin committed suicide by hanging himself. However, friends of Bebenin have rejected this, stating that there was no indication Bebenin was planning to commit suicide, and that there were no messages or notes left behind.\n\nIn the weeks following the disputed December 2010 presidential election – in which pro-democracy candidate Andrei Sannikov lost to Lukashenko, often called \"Europe's last dictator\" – a number of opposition protesters took to the streets, alleging fraud. Radina and the \"Charter 97\" staff posted numerous articles documenting arrests and injuries to the protesters by state security forces. On 21 December 2010, the \"Charter 97\" office was raided by agents of the State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus (known in Russian as the \"KGB\"). Radina only had time to post \"We're all at the KGB\" on the site before being arrested and taken away.\n\nOn 30 December 2011, \"Charter 97\" fell victim to a hacking attack that deleted archives and posted false news articles to the site; it also suffered a denial of service attack.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2067567", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2067567", "title": "Collateral contract", "text": "Collateral contract\n\nA collateral contract is usually a single term contract, made in consideration of the party for whose benefit the contract operates agreeing to enter into the principal or main contract, which sets out additional terms relating to the same subject matter as the main contract. The collateral contract co-exists side by side. For example, a collateral contract is formed when one party pays the other party a certain sum for entry into another contract. A collateral contract may be between one of the parties and a third party.\n\nIt can also be epitomized as follows: a collateral contract is one that induces a person to enter into a separate \"primary\" contract. For example, if X agrees to buy goods from Y that will, accordingly, be manufactured by Z, and does so on the strength of Z's assurance as to the high quality of the goods, X and Z may be held to have made a collateral contract consisting of Z's promise of quality given in consideration of X's promise to enter into the main contract with Y.\n\nA party to an existing contract may attempt to show that a collateral contract exists if their claim for a breach of contract fails because the statement they relied upon was not held to be a term of the main contract. It has been held that for this to be successful, the statement must have been promissory in nature. Remedies may be awarded for breach of a collateral contract.\n\nA collateral contract is one where the parties to one contract enter into or promise to enter into another contract. Thus, the two contracts are connected and it may be enforced even though it forms no constructive part of the original contract. In \"JJ Savage and Sons Pty Ltd v Blakney\" a mere expression of opinion was held insufficient to be satisfied as a promise. In \"Crown Melbourne Limited v Cosmopolitan Hotel (Vic) Pty Ltd\" a statement by a landlord made to intending tenants when negotiating a lease that they would be “looked after at renewal time”, would not bind the landlord to offer a further five year lease.\n\nThe promisor must have expressly or impliedly requested about the main contract and his promissory statement must have intended to induce the entry of the other party into the main contract. According to Lord Denning MR, a collateral contract is held binding \"when a person gives a promise, or an assurance to another, intending that he should act on it by entering into a contract'.\n\nA collateral contract, if forged between the same parties as the main contract, must not contradict the main contract. That is, if the term was agreed upon prior to the completion of the formal contract (but was still included as a term, and could not be executed until completion of the second term), the first term will still be allowed. Essentially the collateral contracts cannot contradict any element of the main contract nor the rights created by it.\n\nA theory sustains that is feasible to typify letter of credit as a collateral contract for a third-party beneficiary because letters of credit are prompted by the buyer’s necessity and in application of the theory of Jean Domat the cause of a letter of credit is that a bank issue a credit in favor of a seller to release the buyer of his obligation to pay directly to the seller with legal tender. There are in fact three different entities participating in the letter of credit transaction: the seller, the buyer, and the banker. Therefore, a letter of credit theoretically fits as a collateral contract accepted by conduct, or in other words, an implied-in-fact contract.\n\nCollateral contracts are an exception to the privity of contract doctrine, which provides that a contract cannot impose obligations or confer rights on a non-contracting party. However, in circumstances where a collateral contract is established between a third party and one of the contracting parties, the Court may allow rights or impose obligations on the non-contracting party, as illustrated in the earlier tortious case of \"Donoghue v Stevenson\".\n\nCommon law recognises collateral contract as an exception to parol evidence rule, meaning that admissible evidence of a collateral contract can be used to exclude the operation of the parol evidence rule. Practically, it is rare to find collateral contract as an exception as it must be strictly proved; and the burden of proof is only eased if the subject matter with which the main contract deals is more unusual.\n\nIn the English case of \"Barry v Davies\", it was held that an auctioneer and a buyer had formed a collateral contract. It was held that even though the main contract does not involve the auctioneer, benefits given to the auctioneer for increasing the price of a bid constitutes a good consideration.\n\nIn \"Hoyt's Pty Ltd v Spencer\", a landlord has promised orally not to exercise the right to termination in the principal contract if tenant signed the contract; landlord ended up terminating the main contract, whereas tenant's appeal was dismissed by the Court.\n"}

Results of the EMEP programme are published on the EMEP website, www.emep.int.\n\nSince 1979 the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution has addressed some of the major environmental problems of the UNECE region through scientific collaboration and policy negotiation. The Convention has been extended by eight protocols that identify specific measures to be taken by Parties to cut their emissions of air pollutants:\n\n\nThe aim of the Convention is that Parties shall endeavour to limit and, as far as possible, gradually reduce and prevent air pollution including long-range transboundary air pollution. Parties develop policies and strategies to combat the discharge of air pollutants through exchanges of information, consultation, research and monitoring.\n\nThe Parties meet annually at sessions of the Executive Body to review ongoing work and plan future activities including a workplan for the coming year. The three main subsidiary bodies - the Working Group on Effects, the Steering Body to EMEP and the Working Group on Strategies and Review - as well as the Convention's Implementation Committee, report to the Executive Body each year.\n\nCurrently, the Convention's priority activities include review and possible revision of its most recent protocols, implementation of the Convention and its protocols across the entire UNECE region (with special focus on Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia and South-East Europe) and sharing its knowledge and information with other regions of the world.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19893886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19893886", "title": "Convention on the Continental Shelf", "text": "Convention on the Continental Shelf\n\nThe Convention on the Continental Shelf was an international treaty created to codify the rules of international law relating to continental shelves. The treaty, after entering into force 10 June 1964, established the rights of a sovereign state over the continental shelf surrounding it, if there be any. The treaty was one of three agreed upon at the first United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS I). It has since been superseded by a new agreement reached in 1982 at UNCLOS III.\n\nThe treaty dealt with seven topics: the regime governing the superjacent waters and airspace; laying or maintenance of submarine cables or pipelines; the regime governing navigation, fishing, scientific research and the coastal state's competence in these areas; delimitation; tunneling.\n\nThe Convention on the Continental Shelf replaced the earlier practice of nations having sovereignty over only a very narrow strip of the sea surrounding them, with anything beyond that strip considered International Waters. This policy was used until President of the United States Harry S Truman proclaimed that the resources on the continental shelf contiguous to the United States belonged to the United States through an Executive Order on 28 September 1945. Many other nations quickly adapted similar policies, most stating that their portion of the sea extended either 12 or 200 nautical miles from its coast.\n\nArticle 1 of the convention defined the term shelf in terms of exploitability rather than relying upon the geological definition. It defined a shelf \"to the seabed and subsoil of the submarine areas adjacent to the coast but outside the area of the territorial sea, to a depth of 200 meters or, beyond that limit, to where the depth of the superjacent waters admits of the exploitation of the natural resources of the said areas\" or \"to the seabed and subsoil of similar submarine areas adjacent to the coasts of islands\".\n\nBesides outlining what is legal in continental shelf areas, it also dictated what could not be done in Article 5.\n\nIn 1960, the United Nations held another conference regarding the Laws of the Sea, UNCLOS II, but no agreements were reached. However, another conference was called in 1973 to address the issues. UNCLOS III, which lasted until 1982 due to a required consensus, adjusted and redefined many principles stated in the first UNCLOS. The new definition of the Continental shelf in the new Convention rendered the 1958 Convention on the Continental Shelf obsolete. The principal reason for this was technological advancements.\n\n"}

{"id": "1152018", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1152018", "title": "Double taxation", "text": "Double taxation\n\nDouble taxation is the levying of tax by two or more jurisdictions on the same declared income (in the case of income taxes), asset (in the case of capital taxes), or financial transaction (in the case of sales taxes). Double liability is mitigated in a number of ways, for example:\n\n\nAnother approach is for the jurisdictions affected to enter into a tax treaty which sets out rules to avoid double taxation.\n\nThe term \"double taxation\" can also refer to the double taxation of some income or activity. For example, in some jurisdictions, corporate profits are taxed twice, once when earned by the corporation and again when the profits are distributed to shareholders as a dividend or other distribution.\n\nThere are two types of double taxation: economical and juridical (international).\n\nIt is not unusual for a business or individual who is resident in one country to make a taxable gain (earnings, profits) in another. This person may find that he is obliged by domestic laws to pay tax on that gain locally \"and\" pay again in the country in which the gain was made. Since this is inequitable, many nations make bilateral double taxation agreements with each other. In some cases, this requires that tax be paid in the country of residence and be exempt in the country in which it arises. In the remaining cases, the country where the gain arises deducts taxation at source (\"withholding tax\") and the taxpayer receives a compensating foreign tax credit in the country of residence to reflect the fact that tax has already been paid. To do this, the taxpayer must declare himself (in the foreign country) to be non-resident there. So the second aspect of the agreement is that the two taxation authorities exchange information about such declarations, and so may investigate any anomalies that might indicate tax evasion. While individuals, or \"natural persons\" can have only one residence at a time; \"corporate persons\", owning foreign subsidiaries, can be simultaneously resident in multiple countries. Control of unreasonable tax avoidance of corporations becomes more difficult and requires investigation of transfer pricing set for transfer of goods, intellectual property rights, and services, among its subsidiaries.\n\nIn the European Union, member states have concluded a multilateral agreement on information exchange. This means that they will each report (to their counterparts in each other jurisdiction) a list of those people who have claimed exemption from local taxation on grounds of not being a resident of the state where the income arises. These people should have declared that foreign income in their own country of residence, so any difference suggests tax evasion.\n\n(For a transition period, some states have a separate arrangement. They may offer each non-resident account holder the choice of taxation arrangements: either (a) disclosure of information as above, or (b) deduction of local tax on savings interest at source as is the case for residents).\n\nA recent study by BusinessEurope confirms that double taxation remains a problem for European MNEs and an obstacle for cross border trade and investments. In particular, the problematic areas are limitation in interest deductibility, foreign tax credits, permanent establishment issues and diverging qualifications or interpretations. Germany and Italy have been identified as the Member States in which most double taxation cases have occurred.\n\nCyprus has completed over 45 Double Taxation Treaties up to today and is also in negotiations with many countries for signing Treaties with them. The main purpose of these treaties is the avoidance of double taxation on income earned in any of these countries. Under these agreements, a credit is usually allowed against the tax levied by the country in which the taxpayer resides for taxes levied in the other treaty country and as a result the tax payer pays no more than the higher of the two rates. Further, some treaties provide for tax sparing credits whereby the tax credit allowed is not only with respect to tax actually paid in the other treaty country but also from tax which would have been otherwise payable had it not been for incentive measures in that other country which result in exemption or reduction of tax.\n\nIf a foreign citizen is in Germany for less than a relevant 183-day period (approximately six months) and is tax resident (\"i.e.\", and paying taxes on his or her salary and benefits) elsewhere, then it may be possible to claim tax relief under a particular Double Tax Treaty. The relevant 183 day period is either 183 days in a calendar year or in any period of 12 months, depending upon the particular treaty involved.\n\nSo, for example, the Double Tax Treaty with the UK looks at a period of 183 days in the German tax year (which is the same as the calendar year); thus, a citizen of the UK could work in Germany from 1 September through the following 31 May (9 months) and then claim to be exempt from German tax. As the double taxation avoidance agreements will give the protection of income from some countries,\n\nIndia has comprehensive DTAAs with 88 countries, out of which 85 have entered into force. This means that there are agreed rates of tax and jurisdiction on specified types of income arising in a country to a tax resident of another country. Under the Income Tax Act 1961 of India, there are two provisions, Section 90 and Section 91, which provide specific relief to taxpayers to save them from double taxation. Section 90 (Bilateral Relief)is for taxpayers who have paid the tax to a country with which India has signed DTAA, while Section 91 (unilateral relief) provides benefit to tax payers who have paid tax to a country with which India has not signed a DTAA. Thus, India gives relief to both kinds of taxpayers.The rates differ from country to country.\n\nExample of DTAA benefit - If suppose interest on NRI bank deposits attracts 30 per cent TDS (tax deduction at source) in India. And since India has signed DTAAs with several countries, so tax may be deducted at only 10 to 15 per cent instead of 30%.\n\nIt is to be noted that in case of any conflict between the provisions of the Income Tax Act or DTAA, the provisions of DTAA would prevail.\n\nA large number of foreign institutional investors who trade on the Indian stock markets operate from Singapore and the second being Mauritius. According to the tax treaty between India and Mauritius, capital gains arising from the sale of shares are taxable in the country of residence of the shareholder and not in the country of residence of the company whose shares have been sold. Therefore, a company resident in Mauritius selling shares of an Indian company will not pay tax in India. Since there is no capital gains tax in Mauritius, the gain will escape tax altogether.\nThe Protocol for amendment of the India-Mauritius Convention signed on 10 May 2016, provides for source-based taxation of capital gains arising from alienation of shares acquired from 1 April 2017 in a company resident in India. Simultaneously, investments made before 1 April 2017 have been grandfathered and will not be subject to capital gains taxation in India. Where such capital gains arise during the transition period from 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2019, the tax rate will be limited to 50% of the domestic tax rate of India. However, the benefit of 50% reduction in tax rate during the transition period shall be subject to the Limitation of Benefits Article. Taxation in India at full domestic tax rate will take place from financial year 2019-20 onwards.\n\nIn an article written for The Wire, Indian lawyer Ashish Goel argued that the May 2016 protocol rewrites treaty provisions with a view to increasing India’s tax take on the noble pretext of tackling treaty abuse. According to Goel, the problem of treaty abuse could have been easily solved by introducing special anti-avoidance rules in the treaty without India having to tax capital gains.\n\nThe revised DTAA between India and Cyprus signed on 18 November 2016, provides for source based taxation of capital gains arising from alienation of shares, instead of residence based taxation provided under the DTAA signed in 1994. However, a grandfathering clause has been provided for investments made prior to 1 April 2017, in respect of which capital gains would continue to be taxed in the country of which taxpayer is a resident. It also provides for assistance between the two countries for collection of taxes and updates the provisions related to Exchange of Information to accepted international standards.\n\nThe India-Singapore DTAA at present provides for residence based taxation of capital gains of shares in a company. The Third Protocol amends the DTAA with effect from 1 April 2017 to provide for source based taxation of capital gains arising on transfer of shares in a company. This will curb revenue loss, prevent double non-taxation and streamline the flow of investments. In order to provide certainty to investors, investments in shares made before 1 April 2017 have been grandfathered subject to fulfillment of conditions in Limitation of Benefits clause as per 2005 Protocol. Further, a two-year transition period from 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2019 has been provided during which capital gains on shares will be taxed in source country at half of normal tax rate, subject to fulfillment of conditions in Limitation of Benefits clause.\nThe Third Protocol also inserts provisions to facilitate relieving of economic double taxation in transfer pricing cases. This is a taxpayer friendly measure and is in line with India’s commitments under Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plan to meet the minimum standard of providing Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) access in transfer pricing cases. The Third Protocol also enables application of domestic law and measures concerning prevention of tax avoidance or tax evasion. Singapore’s investment of $5.98 billion has over taken Mauritius’s investment of $4.85 billion as the single largest investor for the year 2013-14.\n\nIn principle, an Australian resident is taxed on all worldwide income, while a non-resident is taxed only on Australian-sourced income. Both legs of the principle offer an opportunity for taxation in more than one jurisdiction. To avoid double taxation of income by different jurisdictions, Australia has entered into double taxation avoidance agreements (DTAs) with a number of other countries, under which both countries agree on which taxes will be paid to which country. For example, in the case of royalties, the DTA with the United States says that the US will tax Australian residents at the rate of 5%, and Australia will tax it at normal rates (i.e., 30% for companies) but give a credit for the 5% already paid. For Australian residents, this ends up working out the same as if the money had been earned within Australia - whilst still providing a 5% credit to the US.\n\nThe U.S. requires its citizens to file tax returns reporting their earnings wherever they reside. However, there are some measures designed to reduce the international double taxation that results from this requirement.\n\nFirst, an individual who is a bona fide resident of a foreign country or is physically outside the United States for an extended time is entitled to an exclusion (exemption) of part or all of their earned income (that is, personal service income, as distinguished from income from capital or investments). That exemption is $100,800 for 2015, pro-rated. (See IRS form 2555.)\n\nSecond, the United States allows a foreign tax credit by which income tax paid to foreign countries can be offset against U.S. income tax liability attributable to any foreign income not covered by this exclusion. This can be a complex issue that often requires the services of a tax advisor. The foreign tax credit is not allowed for tax paid on earned income that is excluded under the rules described in the preceding paragraph (i.e. no double dipping).\n\nDouble taxation can also happen within a single country. This typically happens when subnational jurisdictions have taxation powers, and jurisdictions have competing claims. In the United States a person may legally have only a single domicile. However, when a person dies different states may each claim that the person was domiciled in that state. Intangible personal property may then be taxed by each state making a claim. In the absence of specific laws prohibiting multiple taxation, and as long as the total of taxes does not exceed 100% of the value of the tangible personal property, the courts will allow such multiple taxation.\n\nAlso, since each state makes its own rules on who is a resident for tax purposes, someone may be subject to the claims by two states on his or her income. For example, if someone's legal/permanent domicile is in state A, which considers only permanent domicile to which one returns for residency but he or she spends 7 months of the year (say April–October) in state B where anyone who is there longer than 6 months is considered a part-year resident, that person will then owe taxes to both states on money earned in state B. College or university students may also be subject to claims of more than one state, generally if they leave their original state to attend school, and the second state considers students to be residents for tax purposes. In some cases one state will give a credit for taxes paid to another state, but not always.\n\nIn the United States, the term \"double taxation\" is also used to refer to dividend taxation. It refers to the taxation of dividend income when received by a shareholder that had been previously taxed at the corporate level.\n\nForeign shareholders are subject to a 30% tax on the dividends, called the branch profits tax. Foreign corporations are subject to United States income tax on their \"effectively connected income\", and are also subject to the branch profits tax on any of their profits not reinvested in the U.S.\n\nIn recent years, the development of overseas investment of Chinese enterprises is growing rapidly and becomes rather influential. Thus, dealing with cross-border taxation matters turns into one of the significant financial and trade projects of China, and the problems of cross-border taxation is still increasing. In order to solve the problems, the multilateral tax treaties between countries, which can provide legal support to help enterprises from both sides with double taxation avoidance and tax issues solutions, are established. To fulfill the \"going global\" strategy of China and support the domestic enterprises to adapt to the globalization situation, China has been making efforts on promoting and signing multilateral tax treaties with other countries to achieve mutual interests. By the end of November 2016, China has officially signed 102 double taxation avoidance agreements. Out of which 98 agreements have already entered into force. In addition, China signed double taxation avoidance arrangement with Hong Kong and Macau Special Administrative Region. China also signed double taxation avoidance agreement with Taiwan in August 2015, which has not entered into force yet. According to the Chinese State Administration of Taxation, the first double taxation avoidance agreement was signed with Japan in September 1983. The latest agreement was signed with Cambodia in October 2016. As for the situation of state disruption, China would continue the signed agreement after the disruption. For example, China first signed double taxation avoidance agreement with Czechoslovakia Socialist Republic in June 1987. In 1990, Czechoslovakia divided into two countries, Czech Republic and Slovakia Republic, and the initial agreement signed with Czechoslovakia Socialist Republic was continually used in two new countries. In August 2009, China signed the new agreement with Czech Republic. And when it comes to the special case of Germany, China continued using the agreement with The Federal Republic of Germany after two Germanys reunited. China have signed double taxation avoidance agreement with many countries. Among them, there are not only countries which have made large investment in China, but also countries which as well-relationship recipient of Chinese investment. As for the agreement quantity, China is now next only to United Kingdom. For those countries which have not signed the double taxation avoidance agreements with China, some of them signed information exchange agreements with China.\n\nThere are mainly four effects of signing Double Taxation Avoidance agreement.\n\n1. Eliminate the double taxation, decrease the tax cost of \"going global\" enterprises.\n\n2. Increase the certainty of taxation, decrease the risk of cross-border taxation\n\n3. Decrease the tax burden of \"going global\" enterprises in the host country, improve the competitiveness of those enterprises.\n\n4. When taxation disputes occur, the agreements can provide bidirectional consultation mechanism, solve the existed disputed problems.\n\nUnder general conditions, the tax rate under tax treaty is often lower than the domestic tax rate under the law of host country. Take Russia as an example, in Russia, the standard withholding tax rate of interest and royalty under domestic law is both 20%. According to the newest tax treaty China signed with Russia, the withholding tax rate of interest is 0 and the withholding tax rate of royalty is 6%. This can obviously reduce the tax cost of enterprises, increase the willing of \"going global\" and the competitiveness of domestic enterprises, and bring the goodness.\n\nThough signing double taxation avoidance agreement is a way to solve the tax problems, there still can be other problems led out, or we can call it \"side effect\".\n\nThe intention of tax treaties is to avoid or eliminate double taxation. The term double taxation which existed in the tax treaties is mostly juridical double taxation, which \"refers to circumstances where a taxpayer is subject to tax on the same income (or capital) in more than one jurisdiction\". By contrast, the economic double taxation \"is related to the taxation of two and more taxes from one tax basis\". Solving economic double taxation mostly is not the main aim of the agreements, but this type of double taxation is not totally ignored.\n\nThe initial aim of tax treaties is to avoid double taxation between two countries. Later, with closer the transnational economic relationships are, and the development of transnational enterprises, the governments realized it was necessary to enhance the cooperation through more well-established law together to face the tax evasion of transnational enterprises. Thus, some terms were added into the initial treaties, especially the information exchange terms and tax collection assistance terms. In this way, the second aim, to avoid tax evasion was appear in the theme.\n\nThe impact and the aim of the tax treaties are integrated, they are both to avoid double taxation in order to improve economic exchanges and relationships, to enhance the government cooperation in order to avoid tax evasion. However, the side effect gradually appeared. The tax provides possibilities of avoiding tax in a legal way to transnational taxpayers. In order to avoid double taxation, the agreement divided the jurisdiction of taxation, including shared and excluded jurisdiction of taxation. It also established the limited tax rate in the origin countries. These all can be called the preferential treatments of the taxation agreement. The transnational enterprises, in order to get maximized profit, can use the terms of domestic law and taxation agreement, to avoid both taxation from origin country and residence country legally and achieve double taxation free. This can be a severe undermine to the international order, and a challenge to the domestic governments.\n\n"}

The BBS software would prompt the user to supply a description for the uploaded file, but these descriptions were often less than useful. BBS system operators spent many hours going over the upload descriptions correcting and editing the descriptions. The FILE_ID.DIZ inclusion in archives was designed to address this problem.\n\n\"FILE_ID\" stands for \"file identification\". DIZ stands for Description In Zipfile.\n\nClark Development and the Association of Shareware Professionals supported the idea of this becoming a standard for file descriptions. Clark rewrote the PCBDescribe program and included it with their PCBoard BBS software. The ASP urged their members to use this description file format in their distributions. Michael Leavitt, an employee of Clark Development, released the file specification and his PCBDescribe program source code to the public domain and urged other BBS software companies to support the DIZ file.\n\nSysOps could add a common third-party script written in PPL, called \"DIZ/2-PCB\" that would process, rewrite, verify, and format DIZ files from archives as they were uploaded to a BBS. The software would extract the archive, examine the contents, compile a report, import the DIZ description file and then format it according to your liking. During this time, it was usual practice to add additional lines to the description, such as ads exclaiming the source of the uploaded BBS.\n\nTraditionally, a FILE_ID.DIZ should be \"up to 10 lines of text, each line being no more than 45 characters long.\" according to the specification v1.9.\n\nThe concept of DIZ files was to allow a concise description of uploaded files to be automatically applied. Advertisements and \"high ASCII\" artwork were specifically prohibited.\n\nEven since the decline of the dial-up bulletin board system, FILE_ID.DIZ files are still utilized by the warez scene in their releases of unlicensed software. They are commonly bundled as part of the complete packaging by self-described pirate groups, and indicate the number of disks, and other basic information. Along with the NFO file, it's essential to the release. Especially in terms of unlicensed software (\"warez\"), it was common for each file in a sequential compressed archive (an archive intentionally split into multiple parts at creation so the parts can then be individually downloaded by slower connections like dial-up. Example: .rar, .r00, .r01, .r02, etc.), to contain this file. This probably contributed to it's extended popularity after the decline of the bulletin board system in the late 1990's and early 2000's until now, since even casual consumers of unlicensed software would have stumbled upon it due to it's abundance.\n\nWhile real-world use among BBSs varied, with the NPD world and even different BBS brands coming up with expanded versions, the official format is:\n\nPlain, 7 bit ASCII text, each line no more than 45 characters wide.\n\nMany archives would stick strictly to the 45 character plain ascii format for the first 8 lines, then contain an appended 80 character wide 8 bit ASCII or ANSI graphic page with better-formatted documentation after that.\n\n\n"}

The Normans gave this Irish inheritance law the name \"Gavelkind\" due to its apparent similarity to Jute inheritance in Kent.\n\nUpon the death of a land-holder, his land was divided equally among his sons. The sons of concubines, if accepted by the father as being his sons, had the same rights of inheritance as their legitimately born brothers. The adopted sons of the land-holder, if any, may also receive a share of his lands, but only if the land-holder had made specific and public provision for this before his death, and the extent of land thus received by an adopted son was not necessarily equal to that received by the land-holder's own sons.\n\nWhile sons received equal shares of the land, the father often prescribed the division, stating which parcel of land was to go to which son. Another known custom was for the youngest son to divide the land into equal parts, and for his brothers to choose their parcels. The eldest chose first, followed by the second, and so on, until the youngest received the remaining land. The purpose of this system was to ensure equitable division of the land.\n\nIn cases where a land-holder had no sons, his widow and unwed daughters, if any, would collectively hold a life-interest on the entire land. Their rights on the produce of the land would lapse upon their marriage or death, as the case may be. Upon the last such lapse of usufruct, the land would devolve upon the agnatic kin of the last male land-holder.\n\nIn 1703, in the reign of Queen Anne, a law was enacted (2 Anne c6 (Ir)) by the English parliament, which is commonly known as the \"Gavelkind Act\". This law made sectarian affiliation a primary determinant of the inheritance of land. When a Catholic died, his estate would normally be divided equally among his sons. However, if his eldest son converted to the Protestant faith, that eldest son alone would inherit all the land, and all his Catholic brothers would be disinherited. The law was intended to put land into the hands of Protestants, and to reduce the size, and therefore influence, of Catholic landed estates.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13539269", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13539269", "title": "History of Palestinian nationality", "text": "History of Palestinian nationality\n\nPalestinian people have a history that is often linked to the history of the Arab Nation. When Islam was started by Muhammad in Mecca in AD 610, Christianity was the major religion of Palestine. Soon after the rise of Islam, Palestine was conquered and brought into the rapidly expanding Islamic empire. The Umayyad empire was the first of three successive dynasties to dominate the Arab-Islamic world and rule Palestine, followed by the Abbasids and the Fatimids. Muslim rule was briefly challenged and interrupted in parts of Palestine during the Crusades, but was restored under the Mamluks.\n\nAfter toppling the Mamluk state in 1517, the Ottoman Turks took control of most of the Arab world. Palestine existed within the Ottoman Empire as two districts, also referred to as Sanjaks. The legal origin of citizenship in the Middle East was born of the Ottoman Citizenship Law of 19 January 1869 and the Treaty of Lausanne.\n\nPalestinian citizenship has developed over the last century starting during the British Mandate era and in different form following the Oslo Peace process, with the former British Mandate definition including the Jews of Palestine and the Arabs of Jordan and the latter excluding them. There has never been a sovereign Palestinian authority to explicitly define who is a Palestinian, but the term evolved from a geographic description of citizenship to a description of geographic citizenship with an Arab ethnicity.\n\nThe Treaty of Lausanne came into force on August 6, 1924. It stated that the Ottoman nationals who were \"habitually residents\" of what became Palestine \"will become ipso facto\" nationals of that state. Article 7 of the Mandate for Palestine stipulated that the British mandatory power \"shall be responsible for enacting a nationality law\". The British authority via the structure of the British Mandate of Palestine was directed to \"facilitate the acquisition of Palestinian citizenship by Jews who take up their permanent residence in Palestine.\" Article 15 stated that \"No discrimination of any kind shall be made between the inhabitants of Palestine on the ground of race, religion or language. No person shall be excluded from Palestine on the sole ground of his religious belief.\"\n\nThe Palestinian Citizenship Order, 1925 was enacted by Britain on 24 July 1925. It began by granting Palestinian citizenship to \"Turkish subjects habitually resident in the territory of Palestine upon the 1st day of August, 1925\". Transjordan was specifically excluded. Provision for citizenship under some conditions was also defined for some persons habitually resident abroad, as well as the children or wife of a Palestinian man. The Order contained no test based on race or religion, except that non-Arabs could opt out of Palestinian citizenship if they were accepted by another state in which their race was a majority.\n\nThis order held until 14 May 1948, when the People's Council, representative of the Yishuv or Jewish Community, declared the creation of the Jewish State of Israel pursuant to the relevant UN resolution.\n\nThe creation of the State of Israel coincided with the expiration of the pre-existing British Mandate. This meant that Palestinian Arabs had no citizenship, but could be categorized in 4 ways: 1. Arabs who remained in Israel; 2. Those who became refugees; 3. Palestinian Arabs who became citizens of Jordan; and 4. Arabs who remained in or relocated to the Gaza Strip.\nPalestinians then ceased to be only Palestinian, but were either Israeli-Palestinians, Jordanian-Palestinians, United Nations Relief and Works Agency Palestinians, and Gaza Palestinians.\n\nThe first Israeli Nationality Law was passed on the 14 July 1952. From the time that Israel was created to July 1952, Palestinians were \"stateless.\" Israeli courts rendered the former Palestinian citizenship, given by the British administration to Jews, Arabs and other inhabitants of the region, \"devoid of substance,\" \"not satisfactory and is inappropriate to the situation following the establishment of Israel\". The Israeli Nationality Law effectively denationalized Palestinians. It granted every \"Jew\" who immigrated to Israel, or, following the 1971 amendment, even expressed the desire to immigrate to Israel, \"immediate\" Israeli citizenship without taking any formal steps. It retroactively altered the Palestinian Citizenship Orders, stating that they had to be \"repealed with effect from the day of the establishment of the State\".\n\nIn order to obtain Israeli citizenship, Palestinians had to prove that they had: been registered in the Inhabitants Registration in 1949; had been an inhabitant of Israel on 14 July 1952; had been in Israel or in an area that later came into Israel between the establishment of Israel and July 14, 1952; or had entered legally during that period. These proved difficult for many Palestinians to fulfill because many at the time had no proof of Palestinian citizenship, and those who had identity cards were forced to surrender them to the Israeli army during or soon after the war. Attaining status as a Registered Inhabitant was also difficult because there was a \"deliberate attempt [by Israeli Forces] to not register many [Palestinian] villages\"/ Those who failed to attain legal status remained in Israel as stateless persons.\n\nAn amendment to the Israeli Nationality Law was passed in 1968. This amendment stipulated that a Palestinian must apply within 3 years of turning 18 years of age, and had to prove that they had been a resident of Israel for five consecutive years prior to their application. A further amendment was passed in 1980 which alleviated the article that had previously required the applicant to have been in Israel between May 1948 and July 1952.\n\nFollowing the 1980 amendment to Israel's Nationality Law, Palestinians are strictly legal citizens of the State of Israel. They have \"passport citizenship\" rights, but are excluded from several aspects of the Jewish welfare state and are therefore denied equal \"democratic citizenship\". While enjoying the fruits of Jewish civil rights (such as access to courts of law and private property) and political rights (access to the ballot and to government) they are denied social rights and economic rights in the form of social security, education and welfare, or access to land and water resources of the State.\n\nThe citizenship of Palestinians living on the West Bank, within the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, also went through three stages.\n\nAfter the creation of the state of Israel and before the passing of a new Jordanian Citizenship Law in 1954, Palestinians were incorporated into the Kingdom of Jordan.\n\nIn 1949, the Jordanian Council of Ministers added an article to their Citizenship Law of 1928 that read:\n\nA new Citizenship Law was passed in 1954. It granted Jordanian citizenship to the Palestinians living in the West Bank and refugees that had fled during the war. The third stage of citizenship for Jordanian-Palestinians began on the 31 of July 1988 when Jordan severed its relationship with the West Bank-they now decreed all those residing in the West Bank as \"Palestinians\".\n\nFollowing the war of 1948, the General Assembly of the United Nations established the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). It was created to give direct aid to the Palestinians that had fled from the war. These refugees were placed in 5 neighbouring Arab states, and these countries granted Palestinians traveling documents, which granted them few rights. The Casablanca Resolution of 1965, which was passed by the League of Arab States, resolved to grant the Palestinians living in the host countries the right to work in, travel from and return to the country of their residence, obtain traveling documents and receive entry visas to the Arab countries as any other national.\n\nWhen Palestinians first arrived in Lebanon in 1948 they were warmly received. In 1959 the Palestinian Refugees Department was created. This body was charged with dealing with refugee affairs, namely issuing travel documents, regulating personal status affairs such as birth and death certificates, locating sites for refugee camps, and so on. Palestinian refugees were issued travel documents that allowed them to travel abroad and to return to Lebanon. Refugees were also allowed, like Lebanese citizens, to travel between Syria and Lebanon without having their travel document.\n\nIn 1995, the minister of interior issued Decree No. 478 which provided that Palestinians who have been refugees in Lebanon since 1948 have to apply for an exit visa from Lebanon and an entry visa in order to return to Lebanon.\n\nThe right to work in Lebanon was also granted to Palestinians, as outlined in the Labour Law of 1962. This decreed that a foreigner is allowed to work in Lebanon provided that his country allows Lebanese to work in that country, and that he obtains in advance a work permit. The first half of that regulation proved problematic for Palestinians due to the lack of the principle of reciprocity-no state of Palestine existed to enact a reciprocity rule. As for the second half of the rule, the Lebanese authorities issued a list of 60 activities that excluded workers with permits-this list excluded almost all menial jobs. The result of this law has been that more than one-half of the Palestinian refugees currently live below the poverty line.\n\nPalestinians who lived in the Gaza Strip when Israel came into being were issued with Egyptian travel documents which allowed them to move outside of the Gaza Strip, and Egypt. Their status as refugees has been deteriorating rapidly since the 1970s. After 1948 they were allowed rights similar to Egyptian nationals, and in 1963 they were allowed to own agricultural land, nor did they have to acquire work visas. In 1964 the government decreed that Palestinian refugees had to obtain an exit visa, an entry visa or a transit visa. In 1976 a law was passed stating that no foreigners could own real property, although Palestinians were later granted the right to own agricultural land. In 1978 the ability of Palestinians to work in the civil service was revoked. Gradually the process of attaining travel documents for Palestinians has become more difficult. Jordanian Palestinians who hold two year passports are now required to obtain entry and exit visas to travel to Egypt.\n\nSyria afforded Palestinians refugees all rights of residence, travel, work, business, and ownership on a temporary basis in 1948. In 1956 this status was cemented in the Law No. 260. Its first article states that all Palestinians residing in Syria at the date of its issuance shall be considered as Syrians in areas of employment, labour, trade, and national service provided they keep their Palestinian Citizenship. They thus enjoy equal rights in all aspects. They have equal rights of employment, in both public and private sectors, and are entitled to social security benefits, labour benefits, residence, education and travel. With regards to travel, the Syrian government issued Palestinian refugees with travel documents.\n\nThose who fled to Iraq enjoy equal rights concerning residence, work, and ownership of residential areas. They also have the right to join the civil service, with all the subsequent benefits. Given the current economic and political situation in Iraq, the quality of life for Palestinian refugees residing there has a questionable future.\n\nThe Palestinian National Authority drafted, but did not pass, a piece of legislation in 1995 outlining its Citizenship Law. Article 7 of this legislation defines a Palestinian as anyone who \"(1) was a holder of Palestinian citizenship (other than Jews) before 15 May 1948; (2) was born to a Palestinian father; (3) was born in Palestine to a Palestinian mother even if the citizenship of the father is not known; (4) was born in Palestine to unknown parents; and (5) was born outside of Palestine to a Palestinian mother and to a father whose nationality was not known – provided that this person opts for Palestinian citizenship within one year after reaching maturity, that he notifies the minister of interior of his intention to become a Palestinian citizen, that he becomes habitually a resident of Palestine, and that the minister does not object to this applicant within one year from the time he receives the notice from the applicant.\n\nThis Draft law does not take into account those Palestinians living in their diaspora. The PNA’s draft Citizenship Law does not address the criteria in terms of which the UNRWA-Palestinians could attain citizenship. The PNA’s concept of citizenship, when combined with their Election Law, incorporates the concepts of jus soli, jus sanguinis and naturalization.\n\nResolution 194 of the UN General Assembly in 1948, \"refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbours should be permitted to do so.\" But the Resolution also states: \"Instructs the Conciliation Commission to facilitate the repatriation, resettlement and economic and social rehabilitation of the refugees\" as an alternative to \"return\". Some argue that this has been converted into customary international law, enshrined as 'the right of return,' but UN General Assembly Resolutions do not establish international law. Those who argue for a right of return usually support a geographical basis as opposed to a religious one. But so-called \"right of return\" is not the equivalent of the Israeli Law of Return (1950) which grants citizenship to any Jewish person and their family wishing to enter Israel.\n\nThe PNA's draft Citizenship Law bestows the executive branch the right to grant, annul, or withdraw citizenship.\n\nSocial citizenship, T.H. Marshall's utopian stage of development of nationality, is inconceivable without an established political citizenship (and an industrial economy), and political citizenship presupposes civil citizenship. To apply Marshall's standards of citizenship to the Middle East citizens, or Palestinians more specifically, is difficult. Citizenship requires the institutionalization of social and political rights within the framework of a given state, which the Palestinians do not have. Palestinians remain unable to access constituent demos in nearly every country they have come to reside in.\n\n\n\n\n"}

A magistrate judge held that producing the passphrase would constitute self-incrimination. In its submission on appeal to the District Court, the Government stated that it does not seek the password for the encrypted hard drive, but only sought to force Boucher to produce the contents of his encrypted hard drive in an unencrypted format by opening the drive before the grand jury. A District Court judge agreed with the government, holding that, given Boucher's initial cooperation in showing some of the content of his computer to border agents, producing the complete contents would not constitute self-incrimination.\n\nIn late 2009, Boucher finally gave up his password and investigators found numerous images and videos depicting sexual abuse of children. In January 2010, Boucher was sentenced to 3 years in prison and deported.\n\nOn 17 December 2006, the laptop computer of defendant Sebastien D. Boucher (born in 1978) was inspected when he crossed the border from Canada into the United States at Derby Line, Vermont. The laptop was powered-up when the border was crossed, which allowed its contents to be browsed. Images containing child pornography were allegedly seen by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) border agents who seized the laptop, questioned Boucher and then arrested him on a complaint\ncharging him with transportation of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. 2252A(a)(1). The laptop was subsequently powered-down. When the laptop was switched on and booted on 29 December 2006, it was not possible to access its entire storage capability. This was because the laptop had been protected by PGP Disk encryption. As a result, investigators working for the US government were unable to view the contents of drive \"Z:\", which allegedly contained the illegal content. A grand jury then subpoenaed the defendant to provide the password to the encryption key protecting the data.\n\nOn November 29, 2007, U.S. Magistrate Judge Jerome Niedermeier of the United States District Court for the District of Vermont stated \"Compelling Boucher to enter the password forces him to produce evidence that could be used to incriminate him.\" Accordingly, Niedermeier quashed the subpoena.\n\nOn January 2, 2008, the United States appealed the magistrate's opinion to the District Court in a sealed motion (court docket, case #: 2:06-mJ-00091-wks-jjn-1). The appeal was heard by U.S. District Judge William K. Sessions. Oral arguments were scheduled for April 30, 2008.\n\nOn February 19, 2009, Judge Sessions reversed the magistrate's ruling and directed Boucher \"to provide an unencrypted version of the Z drive viewed by the ICE agent.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14559", "title": "Indictment", "text": "Indictment\n\nAn indictment ( ) is a criminal accusation that a person has committed a crime. In jurisdictions that use the concept of felonies, the most serious criminal offence is a felony; jurisdictions that do not use the concept of felonies often use that of an indictable offence—an offence that requires an indictment.\n\nThe criminal law in India is derived from the colonial-era British system, does not use a jury system and is codified in the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). Criminal offenses are divided into two broad categories: cognisable offenses and non-cognisable offenses. The police are empowered to start investigating a cognisable offense. The complaint is considered merely an accusation. However, in both cognisable and non-cognisable offenses, the trial starts only with the \"Framing of Charges\" similar to the concept of indictment. The trial court does not proceed with the trial if the evidence is insufficient to make out a charge.\n\nIn England and Wales (except in private prosecutions by individuals) an indictment is issued by the public prosecutor (in most cases this will be the Crown Prosecution Service) on behalf of the Crown, which is the nominal plaintiff in all public prosecutions under English law.\nThis is why a public prosecution of a person whose surname is Smith would be referred to in writing as \"R v Smith\" (or alternatively as \"Regina v Smith\" or \"Rex v Smith\" depending on the gender of the Sovereign, \"Regina\" and \"Rex\" being Latin for \"Queen\" and \"King\" and in either case may informally be pronounced as such) and when cited orally in court would be pronounced \"the Crown against Smith\".\n\nAll proceedings on indictment must be brought before the Crown Court. By virtue of practice directions issued under section 75(1) of the Senior Courts Act 1981, an indictment must be tried by a High Court judge, a circuit judge or a recorder (which of these it is depends on the offence).\n\nAs to the form of an indictment, see the Indictments Act 1915 and the Indictment Rules 1971 made thereunder.\n\nThe Indictment Rules 1971 were revoked by the Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Rules 2007 (on the whole) incorporated into the Criminal Procedure Rules 2010. The form and content and the service of an indictment are governed by Rule 14 of the CPR 2012. Additional guidance is contained in the Consolidated Criminal Practice Direction Part IV.34.\n\nAs to the preferring of a bill of indictment and the signing of an indictment, see section 2 of the Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1933 and the Indictments (Procedure) Rules 1971 (S.I. 1971/2084) made thereunder, as amended and modified by the Indictments (Procedure) (Amendment) Rules 1983 (S.I. 1983/284), the Indictments (Procedure) (Amendment) Rules 1988 (S.I. 1988/1783), the Indictments (Procedure) (Amendment) Rules 1992 (S.I. 1992/284), the Indictments (Procedure) (Amendment) Rules 1997 (S.I. 1997/711), the Indictments (Procedure) (Modification) Rules 1998 (S.I. 1998/3045) and the Indictments (Procedure) (Amendment) Rules 2000 (S.I. 2000/3360).\n\nSee the Indictments Act (Northern Ireland) 1945.\n\nIn Scotland, all of these cases brought in the High Court of Justiciary are brought in the name of the Lord Advocate and will be tried on indictment. In a sheriff court where trials proceed using the solemn proceedings they will also be tried on indictment and are brought in the name of a procurator fiscal.\n\nThe Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States states in part: \"No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia when in actual service in time of War or public danger\". The requirement of an indictment has not been incorporated against the states; therefore, although the federal government uses grand juries and indictments, not all U.S. states do.\n\nIn many, but not all, United States jurisdictions that use grand juries, prosecutors often have a choice between seeking an indictment from a grand jury and filing a charging document directly with the court. Such a document is usually called an \"information\", \"accusation\", or \"complaint\", to distinguish it from a grand-jury indictment. To protect the suspect's due-process rights in felony cases (where the suspect's interest in liberty is at stake), there is usually a preliminary hearing, at which a judge determines whether there was probable cause to arrest the suspect who is in custody. If the judge finds such probable cause, he or she binds, or holds over, the suspect for trial.\n\nThe substance of an indictment or other charging instrument is usually the same, regardless of the jurisdiction: it consists of a short and plain statement of where, when, and how the defendant allegedly committed the offense. Each offense usually is set out in a separate \"count\". Indictments for complex crimes, particularly those involving conspiracy or numerous counts, may run to hundreds of pages. However, in other cases an indictment for a crime as serious as murder, may consist of a single sheet of paper.\n\nIndictable offenses are normally tried by jury, unless the accused waives the right to a jury trial. Although the Sixth Amendment mandates the right to a jury trial in any criminal prosecution, the vast majority of criminal cases in the United States are resolved by the plea-bargaining process.\n\nA direct indictment is one in which the case is sent directly to trial before a preliminary inquiry is completed or when the accused has been discharged by a preliminary inquiry. It is meant to be an extraordinary, rarely used power to ensure that those who should be brought to trial are in a timely manner or where an error of judgment is seen to have been made in the preliminary inquiry.\n\nAn indictment can be sealed so that it stays non-public until it is unsealed. This can be done for a number of reasons. It may be unsealed, for example, once the named person is arrested or has been notified by police.\n\nA superseding indictment takes the place of the previous indictment in use.\n\n"}
{"id": "2045009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2045009", "title": "Intentional tort", "text": "Intentional tort\n\nAn intentional tort is a category of torts that describes a civil wrong resulting from an intentional act on the part of the tortfeasor (alleged wrongdoer). The term negligence, on the other hand, pertains to a tort that simply results from the failure of the tortfeasor to take sufficient care in fulfilling a duty owed, while strict liability torts refers to situations where a party is liable for injuries no matter what precautions were taken.\n\nAs a matter of public policy, damages available for intentional torts tend to be broader and more generous than for negligent torts. To preserve individual well-being and overall social welfare, society generally wishes to deter its members from intentionally attacking each other. For example, in the United States, it is easier to get punitive damages (damages above and beyond compensatory damages) if one can prove that the tort was intentional. Similarly, in most Australian jurisdictions, intentional torts are not included in civil liability legislation, thus excluding the threshold of injury and damages payouts from various legislated limitations and caps. But it is harder to prove intentional torts because as with many felony crimes, one must prove subjective elements involving the content of the defendant's mind, and defendants do not always express their harmful intent out loud or in writing.\n\nThe key difference between intentional torts and negligent torts is that the plaintiff must prove the \"additional\" element that the defendant acted with the specific intent to perform (\"i.e.,\" acted with a mental state of intentionally performing) the act that was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injuries (so-called malice). \"The concept of 'intention' in the intentional torts does not require that defendants know that their acts will result in harm to the plaintiffs. Defendants must know only that their acts will result in certain consequences.\" Under doctrines such as transferred intent, the plaintiff need not always prove that the defendant acted with the intent to bring about the specific injury that actually occurred.\n\nNot every intentional action qualifies as an intentional tort. Suppose an investor holding more than half of a corporation's stock votes on changes the other stockholders find detrimental. If the other stockholders suffer damages as a result, this is not a tort (in the majority of jurisdictions), as the powerful investor had a right to vote whichever way he liked. Thus, the other stockholders cannot sue the aforementioned investor for damages. (California is the notable exception to this rule, at least as to closely held corporations.) If, however, John Doe physically attacks a passerby in the street, John is liable for these costs, as he is guilty of the tort of battery. Actual damages are not required for a prima facie case of battery.\n\nTo successfully sue a defendant liable for an intentional tort, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant performed the action leading to the damages the plaintiff alleges, and that the defendant acted with purpose, or that he had knowledge with substantial certainty that an act would result in a tortious result. A famous case in the 1800s involved a hemophiliac child (Vosburg) who was kicked by another child (Putney) at school, resulting in severe disability of the leg. Although the kicker could not have reasonably foreseen that the kick would cause severe disability, he certainly could have foreseen that it would cause discomfort, and was found liable.\n\nFor example, a plaintiff attempting to prove that a defendant committed the intentional tort of battery must fulfill several elements: intent, an act, cause, and harmful or offensive contact.\n\nHere, \"intent\" means either purpose or \"knowledge with substantial certainty,\" as elucidated in Garratt v. Dailey. \"Cause\" in an intentional tort need only be \"actual cause;\" that is, but for the defendant's action the tortious result would not have occurred. The plaintiff need not allege or prove proximate cause, which would indicate that the result of the defendant's actions was reasonably foreseeable.\n\nCommon law intentional torts include the following:\n\nAn assault is the immediate intentional creation of apprehension of another without consent or privilege. A battery is the intentional harmful or offensive touching of another without consent or privilege. A conversion is the intentional exercise of dominion and control of another's property without their consent or privilege. False imprisonment is the intent to confine or bound someone without a means of egress. Trespass to land is the intentional interference with the land of another without consent or privilege. Trespass to chattel is the intentional interference with the personal property of another without consent or privilege.\n\nProperty torts are a specific class of intentional torts that arise when the right invaded is a property right rather than a personal right.(land is taken from someone, and they didn't know it was theirs because it was passed down.) These include trespass to land (entering someone's land without permission), trespass to chattels (handling items owned by another without permission), and conversion (taking possession of someone else's property with the intent not to return it). \nSome older, and largely obsolete, property law concepts include detinue, replevin, and trover.\n\nDignitary torts are the class of intentional tort, including slander and libel, that arise when the right invaded involves the reputation or privacy of the individual claiming industry.\n\nGenerally, intentional torts are uninsurable as a matter of public policy, meaning that tortfeasors guilty of such torts must pay damages out of their own pocket (if they have any money worth going after). Otherwise, professional criminals could obtain liability insurance to insure against the risk of being caught and prosecuted by the state, or sued in civil actions by their victims.\n\nOf course, this rule has not stopped criminals from attempting to litigate whether particular intentional torts are not really intentional (meaning that their liability insurers would have a duty to defend and indemnify them). The Supreme Court of California forcefully shot down one such attempt: \"[California Insurance Code] Section 533 precludes coverage in this case because child molestation is \"always\" intentional, it is \"always\" wrongful, and it is \"always\" harmful.\"\n"}

The Senate and the Chamber of Deputies did not differ in the way they allocated the proportional seats, both using the largest remainder method of allocating seats.\n\nThe new electoral law was supported by the Democratic Party and its government ally Popular Alternative, but also by the opposition parties Forza Italia, Lega Nord and Liberal Popular Alliance. Despite many protests from the Five Star Movement, the Democratic and Progressive Movement, Italian Left and Brothers of Italy, the electoral law was approved on 12 October by the Chamber of Deputies with 375 votes in favor and 215 against, and on 26 October by the Senate with 214 votes against 61.\n\nThe law regulates the election of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate of the Republic, replacing the \"Porcellum\" of 2005 and the \"Italicum\" of 2015, both modified by the Constitutional Court after judging them partly unconstitutional.\n\nAs a consequence of the result of the December 2016 constitutional referendum, in which the Senate reform was rejected, the two chambers of the Italian Parliament ended up with two different electoral laws, which lacked uniformity. As a matter of fact, the electoral law for the Chamber of Deputies passed by Matteo Renzi's government, the so-called \"Italicum\", based on a strong winner-take-all principle, was still in effect, whereas in the Senate a pure proportional system (the remnants of the so-called \"Porcellum\", the electoral law approved by the cabinet of Silvio Berlusconi in 2005 and then declared extensively unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court in January 2014) was in force. The two systems differed on several aspects, among which the possibility of forming coalitions before the elections (only allowed at the Senate) and the election thresholds.\n\nIn June 2017, the Democratic Party together with the Five Star Movement, Forza Italia and Lega Nord agreed on a law, known as \"Tedeschellum\", which was based on a similar system to the one used in Germany. However, the agreement among the four parties did not survive a secret-ballot vote during the first reading at the Chamber of Deputies and the bill was put aside.\n\nAfter few weeks Ettore Rosato, the leader of the group of the Democratic Party at the Chamber of Deputies, proposed a new bill based on a mixed system, with half of the seats allocated using the first-past-the-post and the other half using a proportional allocation. The bill was not popular in its original version, since several opposition parties considered the number of seats allocated with the FPTP system too high.\n\nA later and revised version of the \"Rosatellum\", known as \"Rosatellum bis\" was approved by PD, FI, LN, AP and ALA in October 2017, becoming the new electoral law for both the houses of the Parliament.\n\nThe national elections use a parallel voting system, with 36.% of seats allocated using a first-past-the-post electoral system and 63.% using a proportional method (the latter including the seats allocated to Italians abroad), with one round of voting. The Senate and the Chamber of Deputies did not differ in the way they allocated the proportional seats, both using the largest remainder method of allocating seats.\n\nThe Senate of the Republic included 315 elected members, of whom:\n\nThe Senate is elected on a single ballot. The ballot includes the district's member, on a purely plurality basis and the parties and party-lists were listed that supported him, which was used to determine the proportional seats, allocated within one single national constituency, with a 3% minimum threshold for party representation.\n\nThe Chamber of Deputies had 630 members, of whom\n\nAs the Senate, the Chamber of Deputies is elected on a single ballot.\n\nThe complicated mechanism known as scorporo, which was used to tabulate PR votes in the \"Mattarellum\", was abolished in the new electoral law.\n\nThe law also re-introduced a closed list system for the party lists on the second ballot, i.e., excluding voters from the decision as to which members of that party would enter parliament, thereby guaranteeing reelection of party leaders whose popular support was rapidly declining (new elections were to be held once the new electoral law was fully implemented).\n\nThe voting paper, which is a single one for the first-past-the-post and the proportional systems, shows the names of the candidates to single-member constituencies and, in close conjunction with them, the symbols of the linked lists for the proportional part, each one with a list of the relative candidates.\n\nThe voter will be able to cast his vote in three different ways:\n\nIn an effort to mitigate fragmentation, split-ticket voting is not allowed.\n\nThe Italian electoral law of 2015, better known as \"Italicum\", a name given to it in 2014 by the Democratic Party secretary and subsequently head of government Matteo Renzi, who was its main proponent (until the end of January 2015 with the support of Forza Italia's leader Silvio Berlusconi) provides for a two-round system based on party-list proportional representation (the former being ruled out as unconstitutional), corrected by a majority bonus and a 3% election threshold. Candidates run for election in 100 multi-member constituencies with open lists, except for a single candidate chosen by each party who is the first to be elected.\n\nThe law, which came into force on 1 July 2016, regulates the election of the Chamber of Deputies, replacing the previous electoral law of 2005, modified by the Constitutional Court in December 2013 after judging it partly unconstitutional.\n\nThe law was written under the assumption that, by the time it came into force, the upper house would have become an indirectly-elected body representing regions, with greatly reduced powers, thus making a reform of its electoral system unnecessary. The upper-house reform, rejected in the 4 December 2016 Constitutional Referendum, was originally assumed to be adopted without a Referendum by 1 July 2016.\n\nIt is the first electoral law approved by the Italian Parliament but never used in a general election.\n\nThe electoral law passed by the centre-right government in 2005 immediately received widespread criticism: among other things, critics called into question the use of long closed lists of candidates (which gave party executives great power in deciding the composition of the Parliament), and the regional mechanism of allocation of seats in the Senate (which made the existence of a \"clear winner\" of the elections less likely).\n\nAfter two unsuccessful attempts at repealing the law by referendum, in the 2013 general election the law failed to produce a majority in the Senate; as a consequence, the only way to form a government was by means of a grand coalition between left-wing and right-wing parties that had harshly fought each other in the election. The resulting Letta Cabinet was perceived by many people as the second \"unelected government\" in a row (after the Monti Cabinet).\n\nWhile the coalition agreed that a new electoral law was needed, it failed to agree on a specific model. The Democratic Party executive and prime minister Enrico Letta even went as far as requesting that his party vote against a parliamentary initiative by fellow democrat Roberto Giachetti to restore the previous Mattarella law. This was probably done out of concern that the grand coalition supporting his government would not hold.\n\nOn 4 December 2013, the Constitutional Court judged the electoral law of 2005 partly unconstitutional: in particular, its unlimited majority bonus was repealed. This made an electoral reform ever more urgent, since proportional representation without majoritarian correction is thought to be incompatible with the competitive party system of Italy.\n\nA few days after, on 8 December 2013, Matteo Renzi became the new leader of the Democratic Party. In his victory speech, he vowed to change the electoral law against the risk of \"stabilized grand coalitions\". Renzi's initiative ultimately led to him taking Letta's place as the prime minister. Finally, Renzi made a deal with Silvio Berlusconi for a set of institutional reforms, including a new majority-assuring law based on a two-round system, conceived to make the event of a forced Grand Coalition impossible.\n\nThe bill still faced harsh opposition, even from members of the proposing parties: however it was approved by the Chamber of Deputies on 12 March 2014 and, in an amended form, by the Senate on 27 January 2015 with the support of a large majority.\n\nAfter the election of Sergio Mattarella as the new President of Italy on 31 January 2015, Berlusconi withdrew his support of the bill. In order for it to receive its final approval by the Chamber of Deputies, the government decided to link it to a confidence vote (hinting at a snap election in case of a negative outcome). The bill was finally approved on 4 May 2015 and signed by President Mattarella two days later.\n\nThe Italicum system regulates the attribution of 617 of the 630 seats of the Chamber of Deputies, excluding 12 seats attributed to representatives of Italians living abroad, and one seat for the Aosta Valley region. An uncommon feature of this system is that it is \"majority assuring\", thanks to a jackpot that is assigned to the winning party, possibly after a second electoral round.\n\nThe territory of Italy is divided into 100 constituencies electing between 3 and 9 deputies depending on their size. For each constituency, the parties designate a list of candidates: \"head of list\" candidates can run in up to 10 constituencies, while other candidates are limited to a single constituency. Gender balance is promoted by requiring that, in each region, head of lists of either sex for the same party should not exceed 60% of the total; additionally, candidates in all lists must be in a sequence alternating by gender.\n\nAt the first round, electors receive a ballot allowing them to vote for a single party and for its head of list candidate (pre-printed on the ballot), and are given the option to express up to two additional preference votes for other candidates of that party, by writing their name next to the party symbol. If two preference votes are expressed, they must be of a different sex: otherwise, the second preference is discarded.\n\nOnly parties passing a 3% minimum threshold in the first round are assigned seats. If the party receiving the plurality of the votes passes a 40% threshold, it is attributed a minimum of 340 seats (54%). The remaining seats are allocated to the other parties in a proportional fashion, and no second round takes place.\n\nIf no party has been able to pass the 40% threshold, a second round takes place two weeks after the first one: this time electors receive a ballot where they are allowed to choose between the two parties that received most votes in the first round. The party winning the second round is attributed 340 seats, and the remaining 277 seats are allocated to the other parties in a proportional fashion, according to the results of the first round.\n\nThe proportional allocation of seats follows the largest remainder method. Each party receives a certain number of seats depending on its national result: these seats are then projected onto the 100 constituencies and attributed to the candidates of that constituency, starting from the head of list and then according to the number of preference votes.\n\nAn amendment, known as \"Erasmus amendment\", makes sure Italians studying abroad in the Erasmus programme can vote.\n\nOn February 24, 2016 a court in Messina sent the election law for review to the Constitutional Court: declaring admissible the application by petitioners, the judges called for the Constitutional Court to decide whether eight out of the petitioners' 13 claims that the Italicum breached the Italian Constitution. The Constitutional Court might still decide that the unconstitutionality hypothesis is not founded, and even refuse to examine it. The court's decision is not expecting until after 2017 January.\n\nA constitutional reform bill passed by the Italian Parliament in April 2016, which is still awaiting popular confirmation by referendum, will require the Constitutional Court to decide on the consititutional legitimacy of the electoral law even if the aforementioned application is rejected. This extraordinary procedure will only take place if the referendum confirms the bill.\n\nThe previous electoral law had a series of thresholds to encourage parties to form coalitions. It replaced an Additional Member electoral system which had been introduced in the 1990s. The attempt to change the law with the referendum failed and was the Constitutional Court, the judgment no. 1 of 2014, to eliminate various unconstitutional elements that were part of the law.\n\nThe block voting system is nationwide-based for the House, and regional-based for the Senate. Italy is divided into a certain number of districts for the Chamber of Deputies, whereas each Region elects its senators. Each district is assigned a number of seats proportionate to its total of the population of Italy. The winning coalition receives at least 55% of the seats on national level in the House, and on regional level in the Senate, while the remaining seats are proportionally divided between minority parties. For the House, seats won by each party are then allocated at district level to decide the elected candidates. Candidates on the lists are ranked in order of priority, so if a party wins for example ten seats, the first ten candidates on its list receive seats in parliament.\n\nThe law officially recognized coalitions of parties: to be part of a coalition, a party must sign its official program and indicate its support for the coalition's candidate to the prime-ministership.\n\nFor the Chamber of Deputies, Italy is divided into 26 constituencies: Lombardy has three constituencies, Piedmont, Veneto, Lazio, Campania, and Sicily each have two, and all other regions have one. These constituencies jointly elect 617 MPs. Additionally one MP is elected from the Aosta Valley and 12 are elected by a constituency consisting of Italians living abroad.\nSeats are allocated among the parties that pass thresholds of the total vote on a \"national basis\":\n\nAlso, parties representing regional linguistic minorities obtain seats if they receive at least 20% of the ballots in their constituency.\n\nIn order to guarantee a working majority, a coalition or party which obtains a plurality of the vote, but less than 340 seats, is assigned additional seats to reach that number, corresponding roughly to a 54% majority.\n\nInside each coalition, seats are divided between parties with a Hare method, and consequently assigned to each constituency to elect single candidates.\n\nFor the Senate, the constituencies correspond to the 20 regions of Italy, with 6 senators allocated for Italians living abroad. The electoral system is partly similar to the one for the lower house, but is in many ways transferred to regional basis. After judgment 1/2014 of the Constitutional Court, the voting system for the Senate aims at party-list proportional representation without majority bonus. The thresholds are different, and applied on a \"regional basis\":\n\nThe electoral system for the senate, proportional representation without majority bonus, does not guarantee a clear majority for any party-list in the Senate, unlike the national super-assignment system in the Chamber of Deputies.\n\nThe new electoral law has come under wide criticism from the centre-left opposition since its introduction for a series of reasons:\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween 1991 and 1993, resulting from two referendums and legislation, Italian electoral law was altered substantially. Electoral law in Italy is determined by Parliament, not by the constitution. This, along with the concurrent collapse of the Italian party system, marks the transition between the First and Second Italian Republics.\n\nThe nearly pure proportional representation system of the First Republic had resulted not only in party fragmentation and therefore governmental instability, but also insulation of the parties from the electorate and civil society. This was known in Italian as \"partitocrazia\", in contrast to democracy, and resulted in corruption and pork-barrel politics. The Italian constitution allows, with substantial hurdles, \"abrogative referendums\", enabling citizens to delete laws or parts of laws passed by Parliament (with exceptions).\n\nA reform movement known as \"COREL\" (Committee to Promote Referendums on Elections), led by maverick DC-member Mario Segni, proposed three referendums, one of which was allowed by the Constitutional Court (at that time packed with members of the PSI and hostile to the movement). The June 1991 referendum therefore asked voters if they wanted to reduce the number of preferences, from three or four to one, in the Chamber of Deputies, to reduce the abuse of the open-list system by party elites and ensure accurate delegation of parliamentary seats to candidates popular with voters. With 62.5% of the Italian electorate voting, the referendum passed with 95% of those voting in favor. This was seen as a vote against the \"partitocrazia\", which had campaigned against the referendum.\n\nEmboldened by their victory in 1991, and encouraged by the unfolding Mani pulite scandals and the substantial loss of votes for the traditional parties in the 1992 general elections, the reformers pushed forward with another referendum, abolishing the proportional representation system of the Italian Senate, implicitly supporting a plurality system that would theoretically force parties to come together around two ideological poles, thereby providing governmental stability. This referendum was held in April 1993, and passed with the support of 80% of those voting. This caused the Amato government to collapse three days later. Municipal elections were held in June 1993, further illustrating the lack of legitimacy the sitting parliament held. The President of Italy, Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, thereupon appointed a technocratic government, led by former head of the Bank of Italy, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, with the sole task of writing a new electoral law.\n\nAs it was under no constitutional obligation to enact a purely majoritarian system (nor were they under obligation to promulgate a new electoral law for the Chamber of Deputies), and cognizant of its declining popular support, the sitting parliament enacted a new electoral law in August 1993 that provided for single-member districts while reflecting their own interests. Despite this, many of them would be voted out of office in the national election in March 1994.\n\nThe national elections used an Additional Member System, which in Italy was a mixed system, with 75% of seats allocated using a First Past the Post electoral system and 25% using a proportional method, with one round of voting. The Senate and the Chamber of Deputies did not differ in the way they allocated the proportional seats, both using the D'Hondt method of allocating seats.\n\nThe Senate included 315 elected members, of whom:\n\nThe Senate was elected on a single ballot. All those votes not contributing to a winning candidate were thrown into a regional pool, where the seats were allocated proportionally. There was no electoral threshold for the Senate.\n\nThe Italian Chamber of Deputies had 630 members, of whom\n\nThe Chamber of Deputies used two ballots. The first ballot elected that district's member, on a purely plurality basis. The second ballot, in which only parties and party-lists were listed, was used to determine the proportional seats, allocated within one single national constituency, with a 4% minimum threshold for party representation.\n\nA complicated mechanism known as scorporo, a previously unknown word in Italian politics, was used to tabulate PR votes. The number of votes cast for candidates coming in second place on the \"first ballot (SMD)\" would be subtracted from the number of votes earned on the \"second ballot (PR)\" by the party of the winning candidate in the first ballot. This would be repeated for each single-member district. This was developed – against the overwhelming opinion expressed in the referendums – to dampen the effect of the first-past-the-post system, which it was feared that it might promote the prevalence of one political party, especially parties that were strong in one geographical area.\n\nThe law also introduced a closed list system for the party lists on the second ballot, i.e., excluding voters from the decision as to which members of that party would enter parliament, thereby guaranteeing reelection of party leaders whose popular support was rapidly declining (new elections were to be held once the new electoral law was fully implemented). Ironically, that is what allowed Mario Segni, the leader of the reform movement, to enter parliament on the proportional ballot after the March 1994, elections, having broken with his party in March 1993, and then reunited with one of its shattered remnants that December.\n\nThe system did not accomplish the goals desired by the voters. The first parliament elected after the electoral reform produced Silvio Berlusconi's first government, which lasted eight months. Small parties still enter parliament and form unstable coalitions. On the other hand, political parties in Italy seem to be coalescing around two poles, if imperfectly so, and governments have lasted much longer, at least by Italian standards. On that level, the electoral reform can be seen as an improvement over the electoral law prior to it, even if Italy has now returned to a party-list system.\n\nBetween 1946 and 1993, Italy used an electoral system that was a nearly pure proportional representation system, which was subject to two insignificant thresholds:\n\n\nFurthermore, voters were able to list their preferences for candidates on a party list, in order to prevent the parties from exploiting the power they acquired from being able to write their party lists. In practice, however, parties were able to manipulate these numbers so that preferred members, i.e., members loyal to one faction within a party, could enter parliament.\n\nAs neither of these thresholds was difficult to achieve, this system naturally benefitted the small parties. This was exacerbated by the fact that the Lower House has 630 seats. Because of the design of the electoral law did not provide for any mechanism to exclude small parties (indeed, it seemed designed to encourage them) or provide any incentives to avoid splintering, this resulted in highly unstable coalition governments (the average length was nine months) and political turbulence; and because voters had little control over which candidates entered parliament, political parties were insulated from the wishes of civil society. Relations between political elites and the masses therefore became clientelistic; voter behavior and politics in general became a contest as to which party could secure more pork-barrel investment for a specific region. It also allowed politicians to become corrupt.\n"}

They bought alcohol from provincial retailers, paying a user charge on top of the retail price as regulation prescribed. They claimed the user charge was unconstitutional and sought relief with compound interest.\n\nThe Queen’s Bench held the user charge was an unconstitutional indirect tax, but denied recovery because Kingstreet had passed the burden on in increased prices. There was a passing on defence. Moreover, ultra vires taxes cannot generally be recovered. Robertson JA for the Court of Appeal held by a majority that restitution should be made for money from the time of legal proceedings, as that was the start of the protest. Before then, the passing on defence applied.\n\nBastarache J for the Supreme Court, because unjust enrichment principles are ill-suited to determine constitutional issues of ultra vires taxes, that is the wrong approach. There should be a remedy as of constitutional right. When governments collect taxes ultra vires it undermines the rule of law. So there must be a right to restitution. Parliament can prevent fiscal chaos by suspending declarations of invalidity and enacting valid taxes and applying them retroactively. The passing on defence is inconsistent with restitution law, it confuses compensation matters, and is not concerned with the possibility that the claimant may receive a windfall. It is economically misconceived and creates difficulties of proof. There is no need to consider the counter arguments to passing on, of protest and compulsion. The six year limitation in the New Brunswick Limitation of Actions Act s 9 applied. There was no right to compound interest, which might be warranted to express a moral sanction.\n\n"}

Malfeasance in office is often grounds for a just cause removal of an elected official by statute or recall election.\n\nAn exact definition of malfeasance (or misfeasance (\"Brit\")) in office is difficult: many highly regarded secondary sources (such as books and commentaries) compete over its established elements based on reported cases. This confusion has arisen from the courts where no single consensus definition has arisen from the relatively few reported appeal-level cases involving malfeasance in office.\n\nUnder English law, misconduct (or misfeasance) in public office is an offence at common law which dates back to the 13th century.\n\nThe offence carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. It is confined to those who are public office holders, and is committed when the office holder acts (or neglects to act) in a way that constitutes a breach of the duties of that office.\n\nThe Crown Prosecution Service guidelines on this offence say that the elements of the offence are when:\n\nThe similarly named malfeasance (or misfeasance) in public office is a tort. In the House of Lords judgement on the BCCI malfeasance case it was held that this had 3 essential elements:\n\n\"Misconduct in public office\" is often but inaccurately rendered as \"misconduct in \"a\" public office\", which has a different meaning.\n\nThe West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals summarized a number of the definitions of malfeasance in office applied by various appellate courts in the United States.\n\nThe court then went on to use yet another definition, \"malfeasance is the doing of an act which an officer had no legal right to do at all and that when an officer, through ignorance, inattention, or malice, does that which they have no legal right to do at all, or acts without any authority whatsoever, or exceeds, ignores, or abuses their powers, they are guilty of malfeasance.\"\n\nNevertheless, a few \"elements\" can be distilled from those cases. First, malfeasance in office requires an affirmative act or omission. Second, the act must have been done in an official capacity—under the color of office. Finally, that that act somehow interferes with the performance of official duties—though some debate remains about \"whose official\" duties.\n\nIn addition, jurisdictions differ greatly over whether intent or knowledge is necessary. As noted above, many courts will find malfeasance in office where there is \"ignorance, inattention, or malice\", which implies no intent or knowledge is required.\n\n"}

{"id": "2910182", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2910182", "title": "Non-economic damages caps", "text": "Non-economic damages caps\n\nNon-economic damages caps, including medical malpractice caps, are controversial tort reforms to limit (\"i.e.\", \"cap\") damages in lawsuits for non-pecuniary harms such as permanent disability, disfigurement, blindness, loss of a limb, paralysis, trauma, or physical pain and suffering. This is opposed to economic damages, which encompasses pecuniary harms such as medical bills, lost wages, and lost future income.\n\nNon-economic damages, sometimes described as quality-of-life damages, compensate injury victims and their families for injuries and losses that are not easily quantified by a dollar amount.\n\nIn the area of medical malpractice, tort reform advocates have claimed that with the imposition of damages caps insurance premiums would decrease, both making medical care more affordable and eliminating a disincentive for doctors to practice. Critics responded that high medical malpractice insurance rates are a result of the cyclical nature of the insurance industry, lack of competition, mismanagement of reserves and a decline in investment income.\n\nMany jurisdictions, including U.S. states, have debated, passed legislation or amended their constitutions to impose caps on non-economic damages. Former President George W. Bush proposed a nationwide $250,000 cap in medical malpractice cases.\n\nFrom the start, some disputed whether damages caps would reduce overall medical costs for patients. A study by the U.S. Congressional Budget Office published in 2004 found that \"Malpractice costs account for less than 2 percent of health care spending.\" Proponents of caps suggested other possible effects of limiting tort liability, such as reducing the extent to which physicians practice “defensive medicine”, the provision of unnecessary medical care in order to avoid potential liability, and would increase access to health care. There is scant evidence, either anecdotal or empirical, that doctors significantly change their approach to providing health care services as a result of tort reform measures.\n\nAlthough proponents of damages caps in medical malpractice cases argue that the caps reduce malpractice insurance premiums for doctors, despite a considerable amount of research on the subject the data in support of that argument is not compelling.\n\nWithin the United States, the impact of damages caps on the number of malpractice claims paid out by insurance companies varies by state. In many states, reviews of malpractice premiums following the implementation of damages caps showed that the caps had no effect on premiums.\n\nIn a personal injury lawsuit, the two basic forms of compensatory damages that may be awarded are economic damages, compensation for the injured person's past and future financial costs and losses, and non-economic damages, compensation for the pain and suffering that results from an injury. Non-economic damages are thus the only compensation an injured person can receive for the injury itself, as opposed to reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses such as lost wages, medical bills, and court costs. Non-economic damages can be especially important for injured people who do not work outside the home, including the elderly, children, and homemakers. The \"worth\" of a homemaker's work inside the home is not easily measured by a dollar amount, and a claim of lost capacity to earn income may not have much value.\n\nTort reform supporters argue that it is difficult for juries to assign a dollar value to these losses with the guidance they are normally given. They argue that there is no basis for non-economic damages, and uncapped non-economic damages violate the equitable principles of justice by being inherently quite random, because different juries will always come to different results. Because of the highly charged environment of personal injury trials, they contend that some awards will inevitably be unreasonable. For example, in \"Ernst v. Merck\", a Texas Vioxx products liability case, the jury issued a verdict of $24 million in compensatory damages, which includes non-economic damages, for a widow of a 59-year-old triathlete who died from arrhythmia, or an irregular heartbeat, that could have been prevented had Merck provided warnings about the drug. Tort reform supporters argue that the widow had not been married a long time, and suggest that the damage award was excessive. However, since the basis for non-economic damages are not easily measured by a dollar amount (which tort reform supporters themselves argue), by the same logic there is no basis to assume that the award was, in fact, excessive.\n\nTort reform supporters argue that juries give arbitrary non-economic damage awards, but fail to argue that the legislature's assignment of non-economic damage caps is any less arbitrary. Opponents of tort reform would argue that members of the legislature are at a greater risk for assigning arbitrary dollar values to non-economic damages than juries; members of the legislature are not present at trial and do not get to observe evidence, witness testimony, and other factors that contribute to a verdict.\n\nOpponents of tort reform contend that jurors should assess damages on a case-by-case basis, that the risk of loss should not be shifted from those who cause harm or could prevent harm onto the innocent victim, and that damages should not be arbitrarily capped by a legislature.\n\nOverall, non-economic damages throughout the United States cover pain, suffering, and other nonpecuniary injuries, and in medical malpractice cases many states have imposed caps that range from $250,000 to $750,000 or more. Damage caps have various purposes; for instance, they can discourage malicious lawsuits and prevent the costs of transacting business from being overly inflated, but have also been criticized as unjust.\n\nMany jurisdictions with non-economic damage caps have defined non-economic damages by statute.\n\nOpponents of caps on damages argue that caps on the amount of damages jurors can award violate the right to a trial by jury. Because tort law has historically been a question of state law, states have the power to establish a constitutional right to a trial by jury in civil cases. Historically, juries have decided both the question of liability and the question of how much damages to award in tort cases, subject to instructions on the law by a judge. Several state appellate courts that have considered the issue have struck down damages caps as a violation of state constitutions.\n\nSome tort reform supporters, such as the conservative Federalist Society, have criticized court decisions that overturn damages caps legislation as a violation of the concept of separation of powers.\n\nIn contrast, critics of caps contend and state courts have held that legislatures violate the principle of separation of powers when they attempt to impose arbitrary damage caps on juries, who function as part of the judicial branch of government. In \"Best v. Taylor Machine Works\", the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that a $500,000 cap on non-economic damages functioned as a \"legislative remittitur\" and invaded the power of the judiciary, in violation of the separation of powers clause. The court noted that courts are empowered to reduce excessive verdicts where appropriate in light of the evidence. The cap, however, reduced damages by operation of law, without regard to the specific circumstances of the case.\n\nRoughly half of U.S. states have imposed damages caps in medical malpractice litigation. Eleven states impose damages caps for all general tort and personal injury cases.\n\nThe Illinois Supreme Court found in the 1997 case \"Best v. Taylor Machine Works\" found that a $500,000 cap on noneconomic damages was (in addition to serving as a \"legislative remittitur\") special legislation that made an arbitrary distinction between those who sustained major noneconomic damages in a single tort versus multiple tortious actions and between those that suffered minor amounts of noneconomic damages versus amounts about the $500,000 cap (such as a plaintiff who becomes permanently disabled).\n\nIn the 2010 case \"Lebron v. Gottlieb Memorial Hospital\", the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that Section 2-1706.5 of Public Act 94-677, which placed caps on non-economic damages in medical malpractice actions, violated the separation of powers clause in the Illinois Constitution and was therefore facially invalid. Additionally, because Public Act 94-677 contains an inseverability provision, the entire Act was held void and invalid in its entirety.\n\nIn California, non-economic damages awarded in medical malpractice actions are capped at $250,000. Non-economic damages are meant \"to compensate for pain, suffering, inconvenience, physical impairment, disfigurement and other nonpecuniary damage.\"\n\nIn Maryland, non-economic damages are capped at $800,000. In personal injury cases, non-economic damages are defined as \"pain, suffering, inconvenience, physical impairment, disfigurement, loss of consortium, or other nonpecuniary injury\" . In wrongful death cases non-economic damages are defined as \"mental anguish, emotional pain and suffering, loss of society, companionship, comfort, protection, care, marital care, parental care, filial care, attention, advice, counsel, training, guidance, or education, or other noneconomic damages authorized under Title 3, Subtitle 9 of this article.\" \n\nMichigan normally has a cap of $280,000 for \"noneconomic loss,\" which is defined as \"damages or loss due to pain, suffering, inconvenience, physical impairment, or physical disfigurement, loss of society and companionship, whether claimed under section 29222 or otherwise, loss of consortium, or other noneconomic loss. However, the cap is increased to $500,000 where the plaintiff, due to physician negligence, is made \"hemiplegic, paraplegic, or quadriplegic resulting in a total permanent functional loss of 1 or more limbs caused by [either] injury to the brain [or] injury to the spinal cord\"; \"when the plaintiff has permanently impaired cognitive capacity rendering him or her incapable of making independent, responsible life decisions and permanently incapable of independently performing the activities of normal, daily living\"; or \"there has been permanent loss of or damage to a reproductive organ resulting in the inability to procreate.\" \n\nIn West Virginia, non-economic damages are capped at $500,000. Non-economic damages are \"(1) wrongful death; (2) permanent and substantial physical deformity, loss of use of a limb or loss of a bodily organ system; or (3) permanent physical or mental functional injury that permanently prevents the injured person from being able to independently care for himself or herself and perform life sustaining activities.\"\n\nIn 2005, a Wisconsin court ruled that a $350,000 cap on non-economic damages in medical malpractice cases violates the state's equal protection guarantee. In \"Ferdon v. Wisconsin Patient's Compensation Fund\", the court ruled that there was no rational relationship between the objectives identified by the legislature that were intended to prevent a medical liability crisis in Wisconsin and treating people with more severe injuries and higher non-economic damage awards different from people with lower non-economic damage awards.\n\nIn Wisconsin, non-economic damages for medical malpractice are capped at $750,000. Non-economic damages means \"moneys intended to compensate for pain and suffering; humiliation; embarrassment; worry; mental distress; noneconomic effects of disability including loss of enjoyment of the normal activities, benefits and pleasures of life and loss of mental or physical health, well-being or bodily functions; loss of consortium, society and companionship; or loss of love and affection.\".\n"}

{"id": "2461099", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2461099", "title": "S corporation", "text": "S corporation\n\nAn S corporation, for United States federal income tax purposes, is a closely held corporation (or, in some cases, a limited liability company (LLC) or a partnership) that makes a valid election to be taxed under Subchapter S of Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code. In general, S corporations do not pay any income taxes. Instead, the corporation's income or losses are divided among and passed through to its shareholders. The shareholders must then report the income or loss on their own individual income tax returns.\n\nS corporations are ordinary business corporations that elect to pass corporate income, losses, deductions, and credits through to their shareholders for federal tax purposes.\nThe term \"S corporation\" means a \"small business corporation\" which has made an election under § 1362(a) to be taxed as an S corporation.\n\nThe S corporation rules are contained in Subchapter S of Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code (sections 1361 through 1379). Congress, acting on the Department of Treasury's suggestion of 1946, created this chapter in 1958 as part of a larger package of miscellaneous tax items. S status combines the legal environment of C corporations with U.S. federal income taxation similar to that of partnerships.\n\nAs with partnerships, the income, deductions, and tax credits of an S corporation flow through to shareholders annually, regardless of whether distributions are made. Thus, income is taxed at the shareholder level and not at the corporate level. Payments to S shareholders by the corporation are distributed tax-free to the extent that the distributed earnings were previously taxed.\n\nLike a C corporation, an S corporation is generally a corporation under the law of the state in which the entity is organized. However, with modern incorporation statutes making the establishment of a corporation relatively easy, firms that might traditionally have been run as partnerships or sole proprietorships are often run as corporations with a small number of shareholders in order to take advantage of the beneficial features of the corporate form; this is particularly true of firms established prior to the advent of the modern limited liability company. Therefore, taxation of S corporations resembles that of partnerships.\n\nUnlike a C corporation, an S corporation is not eligible for a dividends received deduction.\n\nUnlike a C corporation, an S corporation is not subject to the 10 percent of taxable income limitation applicable to charitable contribution deductions.\n\nA corporation is \"eligible\" if it:\n\nA limited liability company (LLC) is eligible to be taxed as an S corporation under the check-the-box regulations at § 301.7701-2. The LLC first elects to be taxed as a corporation, at which point it becomes a corporation for tax purposes; then it makes the S corporation election under section 1362(a).\n\nShareholders must be U.S. citizens or residents (not nonresident aliens), and must be natural persons, so corporations and partnerships are ineligible shareholders. However, certain trusts, estates, and tax-exempt corporations, notably 501(c)(3) corporations, are permitted to be shareholders. An S corporation may be a shareholder in another, subsidiary S corporation if the first S corporation owns 100% of the stock of the subsidiary corporation, and an election is made to treat the subsidiary corporation as a \"qualified subchapter S subsidiary\" (QSub). After the election is made, the subsidiary corporation is not treated as a separate corporation for tax purposes, and all \"assets, liabilities, and items of income, deduction, and credit\" of the QSub are treated belonging to the parent S corporation.\n\nSpouses (and their estates) are automatically treated as a single shareholder. Families, defined as individuals descended from a common ancestor, plus spouses and former spouses of either the common ancestor or anyone lineally descended from that person, are considered a single shareholder as long as any family member elects such treatment.\n\nAn S corporation may only have one class of stock. A single class of stock means that all outstanding shares of stock confer \"identical rights to distribution and liquidation proceeds,\" i.e. profits and losses are allocated to shareholders proportionately to each one's interest in the business. § 1.1361-1(l)(1). Differences in voting rights are disregarded, which means that an S corporation may have voting and nonvoting stock.\n\nIf a corporation meets the foregoing requirements and wishes to be taxed under Subchapter S, its shareholders may file Form 2553: \"Election by a Small Business Corporation\" with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Form 2553 must be signed by all of the corporation's shareholders. If a shareholder resides in a community property state, the shareholder's spouse generally must also sign the 2553.\n\nThe S corporation election must typically be made by the fifteenth day of the third month of the tax year for which the election is intended to be effective, or at any time during the year immediately preceding the tax year. Congress has directed the IRS to show leniency with regard to late S elections. Accordingly, often, the IRS will accept a late S election.\n\nIf a corporation that has elected to be treated as an S corporation ceases to meet the requirements (for example, if as a result of stock transfers, the number of shareholders exceeds 100 or an ineligible shareholder such as a nonresident alien acquires a share), the corporation will lose its S corporation status and revert to being a regular C corporation.\n\nAn S corporation's election will also terminate if, for each of three consecutive years, (i) its passive investment income exceeds 25% of gross receipts and (ii) it has accumulated earnings and profits. § 1362(d)(3). An S corporation will only have accumulated earnings and profits if it was a C corporation at some time, or acquired or merged with a C corporation.\nThe S election affects the treatment of the corporation for Federal income tax purposes. The election does not change the requirements for that corporation for other Federal taxes such as FICA and Federal unemployment taxes.\n\nWhile an S corporation is not taxed on its profits, the owners of an S corporation are taxed on their proportional shares of the S corporation's profits.\n\nActual distributions of funds, as opposed to distributive shares, typically have no effect on shareholder tax liability. The term \"pass through\" refers not to assets distributed by the corporation to the shareholder, but instead to the portion of the corporation's income, losses, deductions or credits that are reported to the shareholder on Schedule K-1 and are shown by the shareholder on his or her own income tax return. However, a distribution to a shareholder that is in excess of the shareholder's basis in his or her stock is taxed to the shareholder as capital gain.\n\nQuarterly estimated taxes must be paid by the individual to avoid tax penalties, even if this income is \"phantom income\".\n\nWidgets Inc, an S-Corp, makes $10,000,000 in net income (before payroll) in 2006 and is owned 51% by Bob and 49% by John. Keeping it simple, Bob and John both draw salaries of $94,200 (which is the Social Security Wage Base for 2006, after which no further Social Security tax is owed).\n\nEmployee salaries are subject to FICA tax (Social Security & Medicare tax) --currently 15.3 percent--(6.2% Social Security paid by the employee; 6.2% Social Security paid by the employer; 1.45% employee medicare and 1.45% employer medicare). The distribution of the additional profits from the S corporation will be done without any further FICA tax liability.\n\nIf for some reason, Bob (as the majority owner) were to decide not to distribute the money, both Bob and John would still owe taxes on their pro-rata allocation of business income, even though neither received any cash distribution. To avoid this \"phantom income\" scenario, S corporations commonly use shareholder agreements that stipulate at least enough distribution must be made for shareholders to pay the taxes on their distributive shares.\n\nS corporations that have previously been C corporations may also, in certain circumstances, pay income taxes on untaxed profits that were generated when the corporation operated as a C corporation. This is very common with uncollected accounts receivable or appreciated real estate.\n\nFor example, if an S corporation that was formerly a C corporation sells an appreciated asset (such as real estate) and the appreciation occurred during the time the corporation was a C corporation, the S corporation will probably pay C corporation taxes on the appreciation—even though the corporation is now an S corporation. This Built In Gain (BIG) tax rate is 35% on the appreciated property, but is only realized if the BIG property is sold within 10 years (starting from the first day of the first tax year of conversion to S-Corp status.) The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 reduced that 10-year recognition period to 7 years (if that 7th year precedes either 2009 or 2010.) The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 further reduced the recognition period to 5 years.\n\nIf a shareholder owns more than 2% of the outstanding stock, amounts paid for group health insurance for that shareholder are included on their W-2 as \"wages.\" The same applies to amounts contributed to Health Savings Accounts (HSA).\n\nForm 1120S generally must be filed by March 15 of the year immediately following the calendar year covered by the return or, if a fiscal year (a year ending on the last day of a month other than December) is used, by the 15th day of the third month immediately following the last day of the fiscal year. The corporation must complete a Schedule K-1 for each person who was a shareholder at any time during the tax year and file it with the IRS along with Form 1120S. The second copy of the Schedule K-1 must be mailed to the shareholder.\n\nAs is the case for any other corporation, the FICA tax is imposed only with respect to employee wages and not on distributive shares of shareholders. Although FICA tax is not owed on distributive shares, the IRS and equivalent state revenue agencies may recategorize distributions paid to shareholder-employees as wages if shareholder-employees are not paid a reasonable wage for the services they perform in their positions within the company.\n\nIn 2005, the IRS launched a study to assess the reporting compliance of S corporations The study began in late 2005 and examined 5,000 randomly selected S corporation returns from tax years 2003 and 2004. The IRS intends to use the results to measure compliance in recording of income, deductions and credits from S corporations, and to formulate future audit criteria to better target likely non-compliant returns. This is part of a larger IRS effort to improve tax compliance and reduce the estimated $300 billion gap in gross reported figures each year. A large portion of that gap is thought to come from small businesses, and particularly S corporations, which are now the most common corporate entity, numbering over 3 million in 2002, up from about 750,000 in 1985.\n\nStates impose tax laws and regulations for corporate income and distributions, some of which may be directed specifically at S Corporations. Some but not all states recognize a state tax law equivalent to an S corporation, so that the S corporation in certain states may be treated the same way for state income tax purposes as it is treated for Federal purposes. A state taxing authority may require that a copy of the Form 1120S return be submitted to the state with the state income tax return.\n\nSome states such as New York and New Jersey require a separate state-level S election in order for the corporation to be treated, for state tax purposes, as an S corporation.\n\nS corporations pay a franchise tax of 1.5% of net income in the state of California (minimum $800). This is one factor to be taken into consideration when choosing between a limited liability company and an S corporation in California. For highly profitable enterprises, the LLC franchise tax fees (minimum $800), which are based on gross revenues, may be lower than the 1.5% net income tax. Conversely, for high-gross-revenue, low-profit-margin businesses, the LLC franchise tax fees may exceed the S corporation net income tax.\n\nS Corporations operating in the City of Wilmington are not subject to the city's 1.25% net profits tax, however, S corporation employee wages are subject to the city's 1.25% wage tax.\n\nIn New York City, S corporations are subject to the full corporate income tax at an 8.85% rate. However, if the S corporation can demonstrate that a portion of its business was done outside the city, that portion will not be subject to the additional tax.\n\nIn Philadelphia, S corporations are subject to the city's income tax (6.35%) and gross receipts tax (1.415%), but not the net profits tax (3.8907%). S corporations also benefit from Pennsylvania's flat personal income tax of 3.07% instead of the high corporation tax rate of 9.99%.\n\n"}

It was first discovered in nature in Mineral County in the Gillis Range of Nevada, U.S.A. The mineral is found intergrown with cryolite, cryolithionite and trace elpasolite. The mineral has a monoclinic structure of P2 or P2/m. The ideal chemical formula for simmonsite is NaLiAlF. The mineral has a no visible cleavage, Mohs hardness of 2.53, a pale white color with a white streak and feels somewhat greasy. Simmonsite was named for the Professor of Mineralogy and Petrology at the University of New Orleans, William B. Simmons.\n\nSimmonsite, cryolite and cryolithionite form together as part of the alumino-fluoride aassemblage in a late stage breccia pipe structure that cross the Zapot amazonite-topaz-zinnwaldite pegmatite located in the described location above in Nevada. This assemblage occurs with around a third of each of theses phases. The three phases form an intergrowth of anhedral to subhedral grains that can be micrometers to approximately two or three hundred micrometers in size. The main anhydrous alumino-fluorides results in size almost 20cm or more across and weight more than 1kg. Another assemblage of alumino-fluorides exist, some that contain water or hydroxyl, pachnolite, weberite, thomsenollite, prosopite, ralstonite, as well as a second generation of cryolithionite.\n\nSimmonsite contains no observable euhedral crystals but it does have complex polysynthetic twinning. Its color is pale buff to cream in the hadn specimens accompanied by a white streak and has a greasy appearance. It exhibits a hardness of 2.5-3 on the Mohs hardness scale. There is no apparent cleavage, a subconchoidal fracture, no parting, and is not brittle. The measured density is 3.05(2) g/cm.\n\nThe optical properties of this mineral were discovered by using the standard optical spindle stage procedure in 589 nm light. It was determined to have birefringence with a Berek compensator. \n\nSimmonsite is a fairly simple mineral chemically as the only elements present in major or minor amounts are Na, Al, Li, and F. The empirical chemical formula for simmonsite is NaLiAlF. The four primary alumino-fluorides behave distinctly different under an electron beam with elpasolite and cryolithionite showing no beam damage with time, even though simmonsite did have some and cryolite having the greatest extent of damage.\n\nNatural simmonsite is monoclinic with P2 or P2/m. The unit cell dimensions are a=7.5006(6) Å, b= 7.474(1) Å, c= 7.503(1) Å, β = 90.847(9)°, V= 420.6(1) Å3, Z= 4. These dimensions are almost identical to those of babingtonite. Simmonsite has had a long history of it being difficult to understand as there have been previous studies trying to understand the crystallography. Errors were discovered in previous work by Holm and Holm(1970) that suggested it was monoclinic, B-centered, a=7.54 Å, b= 7.52 Å, c= 7.53 Å, β = 90.81°.\n\nList of Minerals\n"}

The system consists of perforated metal panels mounted on a building's sun-facing exterior wall, the panels absorb heat from the sun and in turn heat the air space between the panel and the building's wall. The heated air is then pulled into the building's ventilation or HVAC system via a fan, saving building owners on their heating costs and reducing the amount of fossil fuels used. According to Mother Earth News, for every of SolarWall panels installed, about 1 ton of carbon dioxide emissions is displaced each year. An unglazed design is used for heating or preheating large volumes of fresh air, and a partially glazed 2-stage heater is available for achieving higher temperatures when heating buildings in colder climates. The SolarWall technology can also be installed as a hybrid solar system that generates both heat and electricity from the same surface area. By combining photovoltaics with the air heating technology, the heat produced by the solar panels is removed and drawn into the collector, helping to cool the solar panels and preheat the building’s ventilation system at the same time.\n\nCompared to traditional roof mounted solar thermal panels designed to heat domestic hot water, a vertical orientation eliminates any snow buildup and was found to increase winter solar gain, being angled more towards the lower winter solar angle. Reflective snow on the ground was found to increase solar energy as much as 50%.\n\nThree of Conserval's early SolarWall installations have been closely monitored to determine real energy savings. In 1990, Ford Motor Company installed a system on their Oakville, Ontario manufacturing plant, saving approximately 17% on their heating costs at that plant alone. The company eventually installed six more SolarWall systems on other facilities, and as of 2014 have reportedly saved more than $10 million over all their installations. In 1991, General Motors had a system installed at their Oshawa, Ontario plant and, as of 1998, reported a savings of approximately $10,200 per year. Another collector installed at NREL in Golden, Colorado in 1991 is saving about 14,310 kWh of electricity annually, a reported 25.7% decrease. According to Solar Energy Industries Association over of these panels were in operation as of 2015.\n\nSolarWall and it's parent company Conserval have received a number of awards:\n\n\n"}

It can trace its origin to the Literary Society of Bombay which first met in Mumbai on November 26, 1804, and was founded by Sir James Mackintosh. It was formed with the intention of \"promoting useful knowledge, particularly such as is now immediately connected with India\". After the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland was established in London in 1823, the Literary Society of Bombay became affiliated with it and was known as the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society (BBRAS) since 1830. The \"Bombay Geographical Society\" merged with it in 1873, followed by the \"Anthropological Society of Bombay\" in 1896. In 1954, it was separated from the Royal Asiatic Society and renamed the Asiatic Society of Bombay. In 2002, it acquired its present name. It is funded by an annual grant from the Central Government of India.\n\nThe library of the Society has over a hundred thousand books out of which 15,000 are classified as rare and valuable. It also has priceless artifacts and over 3,000 ancient manuscripts in Persian, Sanskrit and Prakrit, mostly on paper but some on palm leaf. The numismatic collection of 11,829 coins includes a gold coin of Kumaragupta I, a rare gold mohur of Akbar and coins issued by Shivaji. Its map collection comprises 1300 maps.\nThe collection of the Society include:\n\nThe manuscript of the \"Divine Comedy\", a poem composed by Dante Alighieri in the 14th century, was written in the second half of the 15th century. It is a beautiful codex on parchment and richly illustrated. It was given to the Society by Mountstuart Elphinstone, governor of Bombay and President of the Society from 1819–1827 and bears his signature.\nIn 1930, the Italian government under Benito Mussolini offered the society one million pounds, calling the book a national treasure. Mussolini believed that the offer could not be refused, but to his shock, the Society turned down his request stating that it was donated by an ex-member of the Society and hence it was their property.\n\nThe adopt-a-book scheme was recently introduced by the Society which allows patrons to fund the upkeep of rare books. The Society is financially in the red with a loss of Rs 1 crore (10 million). Due to the availability of information from the internet, membership has dropped significantly in recent years.\n\nInitially, the Literary Society of Bombay published its transactions under the title, \"Transactions of the Literary Society of Bombay\". In 1841, the Asiatic Society of Bombay commenced publishing its journal titled, \"Journal of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society\". From 1955 to 2002, it published its journal under the name, \"Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bombay\" and from 2002, its journal has been published under the name, \"Journal of the Asiatic Society of Mumbai\".\n\nThe Campbell Memorial Gold Medal was established in 1907 and is awarded to recognize distinguished services on the subject of Oriental History, Folklore or Ethnology which further the investigation and encouragement of Oriental Arts, Sciences and Literature.\n\nThe first winner was archaeologist Aurel Stein in 1908.\n\nEstablished in 1946, the medal is awarded for valuable research work in Vedic Studies or in Classical Sanskrit with special reference to Dharma Shastra and Poetics.\n\nThe Silver Medal is awarded to a member of the Society who has written a book adjudged as the best in the given 3-year period.\n\nThe Town Hall (colloquially Called \"Tondal\" in the 19th century) that houses the Asiatic Society of Bombay was not built in 1804, the year in which the Literary Society of Bombay was formed. Though Sir James Mackintosh mooted the proposal for a grand edifice, it was not completed until the year 1830 (year to be confirmed with tablet on the entrance) after many fits and starts, when the Government of Bombay agreed to make up for the shortfall in funds in return for office-space. The after-effects of this compromise can still be seen in the unseemly crowds gathered at the Stamp Office and other government departments in the Town Hall.\n\nIt is now classified a heritage structure. Heavily influenced by Greek and Roman architecture, it has a portico with eight Doric columns. A flight of 30 steps lead up to the town hall and a wrought iron divided Regency staircase leads to the vestibule. In 1830 Sir John Malcolm, governor of Bombay stated: \"It is the most magnificent structure that taste and munificence combined have as yet erected in India.\"\n\nThe edifice is in the prime Fort area of South Mumbai overlooking the Horniman Circle Gardens and the Reserve Bank of India.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56662536", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56662536", "title": "Treaty of Livadia", "text": "Treaty of Livadia\n\nThe Treaty of Livadia was a treaty between the Russian Empire and the Chinese Qing dynasty signed in Livadiya, Crimea, on 2 October 1879, wherein Russia agreed to return a portion of the lands it had occupied in Xinjiang during the Dungan Revolt of 1862–1877. Although Qing forces had reconquered the area, the resulting treaty was so unfavorable to China that the Qing government refused to ratify it and the emissary who made the negotiations was sentenced to death. Seventeen months later, the two nations signed the Treaty of Saint Petersburg, which apart from territorial matters, largely had the same terms as the Treaty of Livadia.\n\nThe Qing dynasty under the Qianlong Emperor conquered Xinjiang from the Dzungar Khanate in the late 1750s. However, Qing China declined in the late 19th century following the First Opium War. A major revolt known as the Dungan Revolt occurred in the 1860s and 1870s in Northwest China, and Qing rule almost collapsed in all of Xinjiang except for places such as Tacheng. Taking advantage of this revolt, Yakub Beg, commander-in-chief of the army of Kokand occupied most of Xinjiang and declared himself the Emir of Kashgaria.\n\nRussia was officially neutral during the conflict, but as a result of the Treaty of Tarbagatai in 1864, had already gained about of territory in Xinjiang. Furthermore, the Russian Governor-General of Turkestan had sent troops into the Ili Valley in 1871, ostensibly to protect his citizens during the rebellion, but they had extensively built up infrastructure in the Ili capital of Ghulja. This was typical of the Russian strategy of taking control over a region and negotiating recognition of its sovereignty after the fact.\n\nThe Qing counterinsurgency, led by General Zuo Zongtang began in September 1876 and concluded in December 1877, having completely retaken the lands that were lost. During this time, Russia had promised to return all occupied lands to China.\n\nThe Treaty of Livadia actually consisted of two separate agreements.\n\nThe first treaty consisted of eighteen articles, and stipulated that:\n\nThe second treaty contained seventeen articles that focused on the logistics of conducting trade, such as tax issues, passport requirements, and certification procedures, the total effect of which was very preferential to Russian commercial interests and represented unprecedented access to the Chinese interior. There was also an unrelated supplementary article that reaffirmed Russia's right to navigate the Songhua River as far as Tongjiang in Manchuria.\n\nAt the time of negotiations, China was in a strong position. Zuo's army was still in the region and far outnumbered the Russian troops that remained. Furthermore, Russia had recently concluded the Russo-Turkish War and the resulting Treaty of Berlin had not been particularly favorable to them. Military expenditures during that war had also drained the national treasury, so the fact that the terms of Livadia were so heavily in their favor came as quite a shock among government officials when they became widely known.\n\nThe Qing court laid the blame on the chief negotiator, Chonghou, who was described as being inexperienced and over-eager to return home. Upon his return to Beijing in January 1880, he was denounced as a traitor, stripped of his rank and office, and imprisoned. The government decided it needed to save face and following the Chinese proverb \"kill a chicken to scare the monkeys\", ordered his execution. Zhang Zhidong stated that \"The Russians must be considered extremely covetous and truculent in making the demands and Chonghou was extremely stupid and absurd in accepting them ... If we insist on changing the treaty, there may not be trouble; if we do not, we are unworthy to be called a state.\" Additionally, the government declared it would refuse to ratify the treaty and pressed Russia to reopen negotiations. Naturally, Russia wanted to keep the treaty terms, but their only options were to risk another war in Xinjiang, which they were ill-prepared to fight, or agree to China's request. Russia understood that the Great Powers would not ignore an attempt to enforce an unratified treaty and had even kept the conditions a secret, fearing that European powers would intervene on China's behalf if the terms became known. Given their financial situation and the fact that Ili was not crucial to Russian security, they agreed to discuss a new treaty, but on one condition: that Chonghou was pardoned and his life was spared.\n\nAs the months passed, tensions between the two countries remained high and both sides prepared for war. China dispatched Zeng Jize as their new negotiator. The foreign emissaries in Beijing pleaded on behalf of Chonghou, and even Queen Victoria personally interceded. Finally, on 12 August 1880, it was announced that Chonghou would be freed, and negotiations resumed. The resulting Treaty of Saint Petersburg kept many of the same provisions as the Treaty of Livadia, with the major exceptions being that Russia would return almost all of Xinjiang, less a small area reserved for Dungans who wanted to become Russian citizens, and amount of the indemnity payment increased.\n\nFor many years, the story that Chonghou was solely responsible for the debacle was perpetuated by the Chinese government, and this was the view put forth by historians as well. Although Chonghou had survived, he was turned into a nonperson by the government; he was expunged from government records and his letters were not published posthumously, as was the custom for Chinese court officials. Furthermore, neither the Chinese nor Russian governments retained any documents from the negotiations, thus making it difficult to determine how China ended up with an unequal treaty despite being in the better negotiating position.\n\nHistorian Paine investigated the circumstances around the treaty and discovered that contrary to the official story, Chonghou was an experienced diplomat and had a career of over thirty years in negotiations with France, England, and the United States. In fact, he led the delegation to France to offer the Chinese apology after the Tianjin Massacre in 1870.\n\nInstead, Paine believes blame should be laid on the Qing government as a whole. At the Zongli Yamen (Ministry of Foreign Affairs), Prince Gong, who had founded the ministry, had plenty of experience dealing with Russia during negotiations for the Convention of Peking in 1860, and during the Russian occupation period, there was plenty of communication between the two countries that Russian territorial and commercial demands should have been known long before negotiations started. However, despite its charter, the Zongli Yamen was not the only agency that dealt with foreign affairs. Even within the ministry, there was a split between those who were open to foreigners (such as Prince Gong) and those were not.\n\nPaine argues that given Chonghou's experience, because the terms were so unfavorable to China, it is unlikely that he would have made those concessions on his own, as evidenced from the subsequent outrage. It was only when Empress Dowager Cixi sought comment on the treaty from others that it turned into a scandal. Cixi's installation of her nephew as emperor also created a power struggle in the government between her and Prince Gong, whose son was also in contention to succeed the Tongzhi Emperor. Thus, Prince Gong may have been distracted and unable to apply his foreign affairs expertise. In addition, Wenxiang, another diplomat who was also experienced in negotiating with Westerners, had died in 1876.\n\nIn short, Paine believes that Chonghou was poorly advised by the Zongli Yamen and when the court became outraged by the treaty, he became the scapegoat, otherwise the ministry and by extension Manchus (who made up the majority of Zongli Yamen officials) would have to take the blame.\n\n"}

Several versions of UPA have been promulgated by the NCCUSL, the earliest having been put forth in 1914, and the most recent in 1997.\n\nThe NCCUSL's first revision of UPA was promulgated in 1992 and amended in 1993 and 1994. The 1994 revision was often referred to as the Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA). Confusion arose when the 1996 and 1997 versions were also called RUPA. Because of this confusion, the NCCUSL now officially refers to each UPA version as \"Uniform Partnership Act (year),\" where \"year\" is replaced by the actual year that NCCUSL approved it. Many people still use the term \"RUPA\" to mean any version from 1994 forward. Thus, \"RUPA\" may actually imply any version of UPA except the 1914 version.\n\nThe UPA and RUPA provide rules as to many aspects of a partnership relationship including formation, the ownership of partnership assets, the assessment of fiduciary duties, the settlement of partnership disputes, and termination. Each allows modification of these rules in the individual agreement among the partners. RUPA is significantly more detailed than is the UPA as to the degree to which the partnership agreement may modify the default rules set forth in the statute. RUPA also clarifies the nature of a partnership itself by clearly defining it as an entity rather than an aggregation of individuals. There are also a number of other important differences between UPA (1914) and subsequent versions.\n\nThe 1914 version of the UPA was enacted into law in every state except Louisiana. The most recent revision has been enacted into law by 37 states. The NCCUSL website lists the states that it considers to have adopted these and other uniform acts. However, due to state variations it is not appropriate to rely upon this listing. \n\nThe NCCUSL website lists these states as having adopted UPA (1997): Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, \nArkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois,\nIowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota (substantially similar), Tennessee, Texas (substantially similar), U.S. Virgin Islands, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and Wyoming.\n\n\n"}

The event is coordinated by the City Repair Project and consists of a series of workshops incorporating natural building and permaculture design at multiple sites around the city. Many of the workshops center on \"intersection repairs\" which aim to transform street intersections into public gathering spaces.\n\nIn 1996, neighbors in the Sellwood neighborhood of Portland at the intersection of 9th and Sherrett created a tea stand, children's playhouse and community library on the corner and renamed it \"Share-It Square\". Community organizers founded the City Repair Project that same year, seeking to share their vision with the community. In January 2000, the Portland City Council passed ordinance #172207, an \"Intersection Repair\" ordinance, allowing neighborhoods to develop public gathering places in certain street intersections.\n\nThe first Village Building Convergence took place in May 2002, then called the Natural Building Convergence.\nDuring its history, the VBC has coordinated the creation of over 72 natural building and permaculture sites in Portland, including information kiosks, painted intersections, cob benches, and a strawbale house at Dignity Village. The sites are primarily located in the southeast quadrant of Portland. Natural builders from around the world have coordinated the activities at many of the construction sites at the Village Building Convergence. Most of the labor taking place at the sites is done by volunteers.\n\nThe VBC hosts a series of workshops, many of which are free to the public. Topics of the workshops are usually related to sustainability and natural building. Past workshops have included aikido lessons, outdoor mushroom cultivation, bioswale creation, and nonviolent communication.\n\nThe VBC also hosts speakers and entertainment during the evenings of its convergences. Presentations for the 2007 convergence were made at Disjecta by Starhawk, Michael Lerner, and Paul Stamets. Prior years' presentations have been given by Malik Rahim, Toby Hemenway, and Judy Bluehorse.\n\n\n"}
