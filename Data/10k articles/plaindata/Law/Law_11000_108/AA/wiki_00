It was registered in \"League of Nations Treaty Series\" on 9 March 1927, the same day it went into effect. The objective of the Convention was to confirm and advance the suppression of slavery and the slave trade.\n\nIn the Brussels Conference Act of 1890 the signatories \"declared that they were equally animated by the firm intention of putting an end to the traffic in African slaves.\" The Brussels Act was supplemented and revised by the Convention of Saint-Germain-en-Laye signed by the Allied Powers of the First World War on 10 September 1919, in which the signatories undertook to \"endeavour to secure the complete suppression of slavery in all its forms and of the slave trade by land and sea.\" (Art.11)\n\nA Temporary Slavery Commission was appointed by the Council of the League of Nations in June 1924. The commission was mixed in composition including former colonial governors, as well as a Haitian and a representative from the International Labour Organization Frederick Lugard was the British representative on the commission.\n\nThe 1926 Slavery Convention established concrete rules and articles to advance the suppression of slavery and the slave trade.\n\nSlavery was defined (Art.1) as: \nthe status or condition of a person over whom any or all of the powers attaching to the right of ownership are exercised \nand the slave trade was defined as including:\nall acts involved in the capture, acquisition or disposal of a person with intent to reduce him to slavery; all acts involved in the acquisition of a slave with a view to selling or exchanging him; all acts of disposal by sale or exchange of a slave acquired with a view to being sold or exchanged, and, in general, every act of trade or transport in slaves.\n\nArticle 2\nThe parties agreed to prevent and suppress the slave trade and to progressively bring about the complete elimination of slavery in all its forms.\n\nArticle 6\nThe parties undertook to promulgate severe penalties for slave trading, slaveholding, and enslavement.\n\nAs of 2013, 99 countries have signed, acceded to, ratified, succeeded to or otherwise committed to participation in the Convention (as amended) and its subsequent Protocol.

It was then debated at the party’s 9th Congress in July and adopted by the MAN, sitting as a Constituent Assembly, on August 21, being published in \"Monitorul Oficial\" that day. It was Romania's sixth constitution, and the third of the Communist era.\n\nThe document that formed the legal basis for the dictatorship of Nicolae Ceauşescu (who had come to power that March), this constitution brought changes to the organisation and name of the state, and to the expression of its foreign policy. It changed the state's official name from the Romanian People's Republic to the Socialist Republic of Romania. The “brotherly” alliance with the Soviet Union was replaced with the principle of “respect for national sovereignty and independence, equality of rights and reciprocal advantage, non-interference in internal matters”. The state enhanced its involvement in the economy (“it organises, plans and leads the national economy”) and had a monopoly on foreign trade. Like its 1948 and 1952 predecessors, it granted a series of freedoms, including speech, press, assembly, meetings and demonstrations. These rights were effectively rendered theoretical in practice by a proviso that they could not be used \"for purposes against the socialist structure and the interests of those who work.\" As for the state organisation, alongside the MAN, which in theory remained the supreme leadership organ, the office of president of the republic appeared for the first time in Romanian history (via a 1974 amendment), with attributes that gave it, in the framework of the existing system, dictatorial powers.\n\nThe 1965 Constitution was modified 10 times between 1968 and 1986, after which it contained 121 articles in 9 titles. It was partly abrogated in December 1989, following the Revolution; some clauses continued in operation until December 8, 1991, when the current constitution was adopted.\n\n\n"}

It was set up in 1991 under the auspices of the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), also known as \"Bonn Convention\". In July 2018, the Agreement covers 36 of 63 range states.\n\nThe Agreement was concluded as \"Agreement on the Conservation of Bats in Europe\" in September 1991 during the Third Meeting of the Parties of the Convention on Migratory Species. It entered into force on 16 January 1994, after the required number of five states (Germany, The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and UK) had ratified it.\n\nIn 2000, the Parties decided to change the Agreement's name into its current form \"Agreement on the Conservation of Populations of European Bats\". In 2001, the Agreement became part of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).\n\nThe overall goal of the Agreement is to provide a framework for bat conservation for the member states and those that have not yet joined. According to the agreement text, member states prohibit the deliberate capture, keeping or killing of bats except for research purposes for which a special permit is required. Furthermore, the member states identify important sites for bat conservation, survey the status and trends of bat populations and study their migratory patterns. Based on the result of these monitoring activities the Agreement develops and reviews recommendations and guidelines that shall be implemented by the Parties on national levels.\n\nThe Meeting of the parties is the highest decision-making body of the Agreement and adopts Resolutions. Every Party has one vote. Non-Party range states as well as bat conservation organisations may be represented as observers at the meetings.\n\nThe Meeting of the Parties takes place at changing locations every three to four years, most recently in Prague, Czech Republic, 20 – 22 September 2010. (Status: October 2012)\n\nThe advisory committee is the working body of the agreement. It evaluates data and discusses scientific issues concerning bat research and conservation to set priorities for the Agreement’ future work. The committee deals with topics like bat migration, light pollution or the impact of wind turbines on bat populations. Furthermore, it drafts the Resolutions to be adopted at the Meetings of the Parties.\n\nThe Committee meets once a year, most recently in Dublin, Ireland, 15–17 May 2012. (Status: October 2012)\n\nThe standing committee is the administrative body of the Agreement. It monitors the execution of the Secretariat’s budget, oversees the implementation of policies by the Secretariat and discusses further administrative matters like staff issues. The Committee was established by the 5th Meeting of the Parties in autumn 2006 to redesign the Advisory Committee to scientific issues. \n\nThe Committee shall meet once a year, if a meeting is needed, at the UN Campus in Bonn/Germany. The first Meeting took place in March 2007, the most recent one in Paris, France, on 28 March 2012. (Status: October 2012)\n\nThe Secretariat is the executive body of the Agreement. It coordinates and organises the activities of the Meeting of the Parties, the Advisory Committee and the Standing Committee and undertakes initiatives for implementing the aspired aims, attracting more member states and exchanging information. Furthermore, it coordinates international research and monitoring activities. \n\nAnother main task of the Secretariat is to raise public awareness. The “European Bat Night” goes back to an initiative of the EUROBATS Secretariat and is today an event in more than 30 European states.\n\nThe Secretariat was established by the 1st Meeting of the Parties in 1995 and started its work in Bonn/Germany in 1996. Since June 2006 it is accommodated at the UN Campus in the former parliamentary building of the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\nThe Agreement area covers continental Europe from the Caucasus and Turkey in the East to the Mediterranean coast in the South. In includes the British Isles, Cyprus and Malta and most of the islands belonging to European states (except the Canary Islands, Madeira and the Azores).\n\nThe following 35 of possible 65 range states have ratified the Agreement by the end of 2017 (alphabetical order).\n\n"}
{"id": "621524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=621524", "title": "Apostille Convention", "text": "Apostille Convention\n\nThe Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalisation for Foreign Public Documents, the Apostille Convention, or the Apostille Treaty, is an international treaty drafted by the Hague Conference on Private International Law. It specifies the modalities through which a document issued in one of the signatory countries can be certified for legal purposes in all the other signatory states. A certification under the terms of the convention is called an apostille (from Latin \"post illa\" and then ) or Hague Apostille. It is an international certification comparable to a notarisation in domestic law, and normally supplements a local notarisation of the document. If the convention applies between two countries, such an apostille is sufficient to certify a document's validity, and removes the need for double-certification, by the originating country and then by the receiving country.\n\nApostilles are affixed by \"Competent Authorities\" designated by the government of a state which is party to the convention. A list of these authorities is maintained by the Hague Conference on Private International Law. Examples of designated authorities are embassies, ministries, courts or (local) governments. For example, in the United States, the Secretary of State of each state and his or her deputies are usually competent authorities. In the United Kingdom all apostilles are issued by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in Milton Keynes.\n\nTo be eligible for an apostille, a document must first be issued or certified by an officer recognised by the authority that will issue the apostille. For example, in the US state of Vermont, the Secretary of State maintains specimen signatures of all notaries public, so documents that have been notarised are eligible for apostilles. Likewise, courts in the Netherlands are eligible to place an apostille on all municipal civil status documents directly. In some cases, intermediate certifications may be required in the country in which the document originates before it is eligible for an apostille. For example, in New York City, the Office of Vital Records (which issues, among other things, birth certificates) is not directly recognised by the New York Secretary of State. As a consequence, the signature of the City Clerk must be certified by the County Clerk of New York County to make the birth certificate eligible for an apostille. In Japan all official documents are issued in Japanese; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA, JAPAN) can then provide an apostille for these documents. In India the apostille certification can be obtained from the Ministry of External Affairs in New Delhi, after authentication by the administration of the Indian state where the document was issued (for educational documents).\n\nThe apostille itself is a stamp or printed form consisting of 10 numbered standard fields. On the top is the text \"APOSTILLE\", under which the text \"Convention de La Haye du 5 octobre 1961\" (French for “Hague Convention of 5 October 1961“) is placed. This title must be written in French for the Apostille to be valid (article 4 of the Convention). In the numbered fields, the following information is added (may be in official language of the authority which issues it or in a second language):\n\n1. Country … [e.g. Korea, Spain] This public document \n2. has been signed by [e.g. Henry Cho] \n3. acting in the capacity of [e.g. Notary Public] \n4. bears the seal/stamp of [e.g. High Court of Hong Kong] Certified \n5. at [e.g. Hong Kong] \n6. the … [e.g. 16 April 2014] \n7. by … [e.g. the Chief Executive of the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong] \n8. No … [e.g. 2536218517] \n9. Seal/stamp … [of the authority giving the apostille] \n10. Signature\n\nThe information can be placed on the document itself, on the back of the document, or attached to the document as an allonge.\n\nFour types of documents are mentioned in the convention:\n\nA state that has not signed the Convention must specify how foreign legal documents can be certified for its use. Two countries may have a special convention on the recognition of each other's public documents, but in practice this is infrequent. Otherwise, the document must be certified by the foreign ministry of the country in which the document originated, and then by the foreign ministry of the government of the state in which the document will be used; one of the certifications will often be performed at an embassy or consulate. In practice this means the document must be certified twice before it can have legal effect in the receiving country. For example, as Canada is not a signatory, Canadian documents for use abroad must be certified by the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs in Ottawa or by a Canadian consular official abroad, and subsequently by the relevant government office or consulate of the receiving state.\nThe convention has 115 parties and is in force for all members of the European Union and all but ten members of the Hague Conference on Private International Law. The convention had not entered into force in Bolivia and Tunisia; it entered into force in Guatemala on 18 September 2017. \n\nSaudi Arabia is not a party to the convention.\n\nThe Apostille does not give information regarding the quality of the content in the underlying document, but certifies the signature (and the capacity of who placed it) and correctness of the seal/stamp on the document which must be certified. In 2005 The Hague Conference surveyed its members and produced a report in December 2008 which expressed serious concerns about Diplomas and Degree certificates issued by diploma mills. The possible abuse of the system was highlighted \"Particularly troubling is the possible use of diploma mill qualifications to circumvent migration controls, possibly by potential terrorists.\" (page 5) The risk comes from the fact that the various government stamps give the document an air of authenticity without anyone having checked the underlying document. \"An official looking certificate may be issued to a copy of a diploma mill qualification, and then subsequently issued with an Apostille, without anyone having ever verified the signature on, let alone the contents of, the diploma.\" (page 7) Further member states indicated \"they would be obliged to issue an Apostille for certification of a certified copy of a diploma issued by a diploma mill\". (page 15) The evaluation commission of the Hague Conference expressed concern as to whether this issue could affect the entire convention.\n\"... the Apostille does not 'look through the certification' and does not relate to the diploma itself ... There is a clear risk that such practices may eventually undermine the effectiveness and therefore the successful operation of the Apostille Convention\". (page 5)\n\nIn February 2009 the Hague Conference recommended to amend the wording on the Apostille to make it clear that only the seal and the signature were authenticated. The wording to be added is:\n\"This Apostille only certifies the signature, the capacity of the signer and the seal or stamp it bears. It does not certify the content of the document for which it was issued.\"\n\n\n"}

Unclaimed property other than money might also be claimed on behalf of the Crown but (as with the UK jurisdictions) this is not inevitable.\n\n\"Bona vacantia\" is partly a common law doctrine and partly found in statute. It deals with:\n\n\nFor most of England and Wales, the Bona Vacantia Division of the Government Legal Department is responsible for dealing with \"bona vacantia\" assets on behalf of the Crown. If no heirs to an estate can be found then the assets are realised and the balance is transferred to HM Treasury. The division deals only with solvent estates whose net value exceeds £500. The assets of dissolved companies automatically pass to the Crown by law. They are realised by the division and the revenue passed to the Exchequer, although the division has a power to disclaim onerous assets. Liabilities associated with assets do not automatically follow those assets into \"bona vacantia\". Care should be taken to distinguish between assets remaining when dissolution commences (which, e.g., might be distributed to shareholders or others in that process) and those that for various valid reasons remain undistributed at the end of dissolution. Some assets might only come to notice after dissolution has taken place.\n\nFor assets based in Cornwall and within the traditional boundaries of the county palatine of Lancashire, Farrer & Co solicitors deal with \"bona vacantia\" on behalf of the Duchy of Cornwall and the Duchy of Lancaster respectively. In both cases, if no rightful owner is found for the assets, the assets legally pass to the respective duchies. Current practice for both is to donate these assets to charity. In Lancaster the beneficiaries are the Duchy of Lancaster Benevolent Fund and the Duchy of Lancaster Jubilee Trust, while in Cornwall The Duke of Cornwall's Benevolent Fund receives the assets.\n\nWhen the English King established in 1230 the Office of the Royal Escheator to centralize bona vacantia, Earl Edmund of Cornwall pressed his claim to bona vacantia by having his viscounts continue to handle them. Until the 1337 and 1338 Duchy Charters, the issue was contentious between the king and earl. In the Duchy Charters, the King formalized the bona vacantia right with the duchy.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, \"bona vacantia\" is dealt with by the Crown Solicitor as the Treasury Solicitor's agent. The value of the assets collected in Northern Ireland are separately identified in the annual report of HM Procurator General and Treasury Solicitor Accounts for the Crown's Nominee.\n\nIn Scotland, \"bona vacantia\" deals with assets of dissolved companies, the assets of missing persons and lost or abandoned property; lost or abandoned property involves a statutory saving for the Crown in ss.67–79 of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982. It is mostly controlled by Common Law with some statutes dealing with specific matters such as lost property; the concept also extends to such matters as Treasure trove The separate doctrine of \"ultimus haeres\" states that the assets of those who die intestate leaving no other person entitled to inherit pass to the Crown. Both of these rights, together with treasure trove, are administered by the Queen's and Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer, an office held by the Crown Agent, the senior official in the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS). \"Bona vacantia\" assets in Scotland are not aggregated with those from elsewhere in the United Kingdom, being paid directly into the Scottish Consolidated Fund.\n\nIn Guernsey, assets of dissolved companies may become \"bona vacantia\" under s.369 of the Companies (Guernsey) Law, as amended, and are administered by the Receiver-General (\"HM Procureur\").\n\n\"Bona vacantia\" was inherited from English Common Law and continues in the form of lost, mislaid, and abandoned property, applied only to personal property that has left the owner's possession, as opposed to an estate left in intestacy after death. Intangible personal assets such as checks, account balances, and securities are under unclaimed property law, varying by state. The states do not take permanent possession, but act as the custodian of the property in perpetuity on behalf of the rightful owner.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3512716", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3512716", "title": "Bottom of the harbour tax avoidance", "text": "Bottom of the harbour tax avoidance\n\nBottom of the harbour tax avoidance was a form of tax avoidance used in Australia in the 1970s. Legislation (below) made it a criminal offence in 1980. The practice came to symbolise the worst of variously contrived tax strategies from those times.\nIn its 1986/87 annual report, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) stated a total 6,688 companies had been involved, involving revenue of between $500 million and $1 billion.\n\nThe operation at the heart of bottom of the harbour schemes was simple. A company would be stripped of assets and accumulated profits before its tax fell due, leaving it then unable to pay.\nOnce assets were stripped, the company would be sent, metaphorically, to the \"bottom of the harbour\" by being transferred to someone of limited means and with little interest in its past activities. The company's records were often lost too. The ATO, being in the same position as other unsecured creditors in the case of an insolvent company, ended up with nothing.\n\nPromoters such as lawyers or accountants generally facilitated the transactions. The promoter would help the owners of a company first transfer the assets to a new company which was to continue the business, then the owners sold the old company to the promoter for the value of the untaxed accumulated profits, less an amount representing a fee or commission. For the owners this was the sale of a capital asset and hence untaxed (being prior to Capital Gains Tax).\n\nThe promoter would have the company pay (to the promoter) a dividend of the money it had left, then the promoter on-sold the now empty shell to someone else. The way the promoter paid the owners for undistributed profits was similar to a dividend strip operation. In any case the amount the promoter paid was a tax deduction (since the promoter would be in the business of buying and selling shares) and the dividend would be taxable income, leaving just the promoter's commission taxable, not the whole original company profit.\n\nThe \"harbour\" in the expression was usually taken as referring to Sydney Harbour (which is adjacent to the financial district), though obviously the sense is also quite general. The actual origin of the name and the practice is not clear.\n\nThe first time the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) detected a bottom of the harbour scheme was in 1973. Rod Todman, a senior investigations officer in Perth, found a scheme involving about 50 companies and selected one for investigation. By 1974, he had assembled evidence which was referred to the Deputy Crown Solicitor (DCS) in Perth for possible prosecution as a test case.\n\nThe DCS was uncertain of the prospects for the case, but in late 1974 had a Queen's Counsel opinion strongly recommending charges of conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth be brought against the promoter and two other individuals. There then followed delay upon delay, duplicated investigations, ill-prepared reports by inexperienced officers, and even a DCS officer deliberately avoiding contact with the ATO.\n\nAfter five full years, in April 1979, and based on miscommunication, the Crown Solicitor in Canberra advised the ATO that the evidence was insufficient and the case was dropped. It might well have been that it was not strong enough, but that decision was not arrived at in a well-considered way. The performance of the various DCS officers was later the subject of scathing criticism, with problems arising primarily from overworked and underskilled staff, and bad management.\n\nThe abandoned case only came to light in 1982 in the Costigan Royal Commission investigating activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. The Commission came upon bank account transactions for millions of dollars, and the \"paper trail\", as it was called, led eventually, and among other things, to the bottom drawers of the DCS Perth.\n\nOne of those other things the commission found was that the wife of one of the senior case officers at the DCS Perth was running an escort service, and that she was a company secretary at several companies which were involved in bottom of the harbour schemes. There was no suggestion her husband improperly used his position, but the connection was close enough to be extremely embarrassing for all concerned, and the officer was dismissed.\n\nIn 1980, the \"Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980\" put an end to bottom of the harbour schemes. Under the act it became a criminal offence for any person to make a company or trust unable to pay tax debts (income tax, sales tax, etc.), or to aid or abet any person or company doing so. The act thus caught both those in the schemes and the promoters of such schemes. It made it unnecessary to go through the crime of defrauding the Commonwealth that had been so poorly handled at the Deputy Crown Solicitor above.\n\nThis act was controversial at the time, since tax avoidance was (and perhaps still is) regarded as something less than an outright crime. Tax matters might normally be addressed by closing a revenue loophole, the act instead treated bottom of the harbour schemes like frauds.\n\nThe \"Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Act 1982\" went further, allowing for the recovery of tax avoided under bottom of the harbour tax schemes between 1 January 1972 and 4 December 1980. The retrospectivity in this act was even more controversial than making the avoidance a crime.\n\nTreasurer John Howard said the normal reluctance against retrospectivity was \"tempered by the competing consideration of overall perceptions as to the equity and fairness of our taxation system and the distribution of the tax burden.\" (House, 23 September 1982). Senator Don Chipp thought the purpose noble but was strongly against retrospectivity, saying \"I do not trust politicians to legislate retrospectively. One of the few protections that the ordinary citizen has is that he knows the law.\" (Senate, 19 November 1982).\n\n\n\n"}

Subsequently, Constitutional Amendment number 19 relaxed this requirement by establishing the possibility of adopting the statutory regime or Hired Under Employment Laws, but was reinstated after the foregoing assessment of ADIn 2135.\nThe regulation of the legal regime of civil servants federal government, local and federal public foundations is carried out in Brazil under Federal Law no. 8.112/1990. Are not included in the legal regime established by this Act that federal employees are governed by the dictates of the Consolidation of Labor Laws and Federal Law no. 9.962/2000.\nIt should be understood that under the Federal Constitution of 1988, both regimes must respect constitutionally established rules, for example, all accepted by the public employer shall be subject to a tender or selection process.\n\nThus, in Brazil so-called statutory servants (connected to the system of Federal Law no. 8112) and servants called \"celetistas\", which obey the Consolidation of Labor Laws.\nHowever, in order to grant interim with \"ex nunc\" effect on the date of August 2, 2007 ADIn in 2135, which suspended the effectiveness of EC 19 in that it modifies the chapeau of Article 39 for violation of the CF/1988 Article 60, II, of CF/1988 (vice-initiative), the Legal One has been restored.\n\nThe term \"civil servant\" and \"tenured servant\" appear in the Constitution of Brazil. Article 41 of the Federal Constitution states that \"Servants who, by virtue of public entrance examinations, are appointed to effective posts, acquire tenure after three years of actual service.\"\n\nCivil servants are listed as a category of public servants: they are permanent staff, professionals in the service of public administration. The Brazilian Penal Code, however, refers to a public official, which has a broader scope than the public servant. A board member, for example, who exercises a public function (help in the electoral process), is a civilian employee (in respect of acts performed as a board member), despite a transient and unpaid public role.\n\nFilling is the administrative act of filling public office in Brazil regulated by Law No. 8112 of November 11, 1990 [1].\nUnder the legislation, the provision may be given by appointment, promotion, rehabilitation, recovery, recovery, reintegration and renewal.Each of these forms of provision has a special significance in public administration and specify the legal form of access to public office in Brazil.\n\nThe fee payment for services rendered to the state civil servant is given as follows:\nEarning. \nCF/88 Article 39 § 4: The State of Power, the holder of an elective office, Ministers of State and Municipal and State Secretaries shall be paid exclusively by fixed allowance in a lump sum, sealed the addition of any bonus, additional allowance, award, grant or other type of representation remuneration, obeyed in any case the provisions of art. 37, X and X\nAny salary within the public service may exceed the value of allowances paid to Justices of the Supreme Court (STF) and the salaries of the offices of the Legislative and the Judiciary can not be higher than those paid by the executive. Despite these rules exist, many people are wondering if they are indeed obeyed.\n\n"}

Thus, Canadian Aboriginal Law is different than Indigenous Law. In Canada, Indigenous Law refers to the legal traditions, customs, and practices of Indigenous peoples and groups. Canadian Aboriginal law provides certain Constitutionally recognized rights to land and traditional practices. Aboriginal is a term used in the Constitution of Canada and includes First Nations, Inuit and Métis people. Canadian Aboriginal Law enforces and interprets certain treaties between the government and Indigenous people, and manages much of their interaction. A major area of Aboriginal law involves the duty to consult and accommodate.\n\nAboriginal law is based on a variety of sources. The Royal Proclamation of 1763 is the foundation document creating special land rights for Indigenous peoples within Canada (which was called \"Quebec\" in 1763). Section 91(24) of the \"Constitution Act, 1867\" gives the federal parliament exclusive power to legislate in matters related to \"Indians, and Lands reserved for the Indians\". Under this power, that legislative body has enacted the Indian Act, First Nations Land Management Act, Indian Oil and Gas Act, and the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development Act. Part II of the Constitution Act, 1982, recognizes Aboriginal treaty and land rights, with section 35 being particularly important. Section 35's recognition of Aboriginal rights refers to an ancient source of Aboriginal rights in custom.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "49619312", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49619312", "title": "Charter of Duke Trpimir", "text": "Charter of Duke Trpimir\n\nCharter of Duke Trpimir (), also known as Trpimir's deed of donation () is the oldest preserved document of the Croatian law, the oldest from the court of one of the Croatian rulers and the first national document which mentions the Croatian name. Charter, dated to 4 March 852, is not preserved in its original form but in five subsequent transcripts out of which the oldest is from year 1568.\n\nDating of the Charter is contained in the following sentence in Latin: \"Regnante in Italia piissimo Lothario Francorum rege per indictionem XV sub die IIII Nonis Martii\" ().\n\nHistorians Daniele Farlati and Ivan Kukuljević Sakcinski considered that the indiction XV refers to the year 837, while Ivan Lučić Lucius considered that indiction refers to the year 838, which cannot be because of indiction. Historian Franjo Rački corrected the opinion of Farlati and Kukuljević Sakcinski because Lothair I reigned as \"Francorum rex\", King of Franks, only since year 840, and also because, according to chronicler John the Deacon, Duke Mislav reigned over Duchy of Croatia in year 837. Accordingly, indiction XV can only refer to year 852.\n\nMiho Barada gave the first extensive palaeographic-diplomatic analysis to attempt to reconstruct the original text. In addition, valuable contributions were also given by Lovre Katić and Marko Kostrenčić. Držislav Švob considered this Charter to be forgery from 14th century because of its \"unconvincing arguments and arbitrary assumptions\".\n\nIn recent years, the debate on the issue was renewed by Lujo Margetić who thought that, because Lothari had already left Italy in year 840 and succeeded his father to the imperial throne, it is very unlikely that Trpimir was unaware of that change on the imperial throne even twelve years later. According to Margetić, the real date when the document was written would be March 4, 840. This Margetić's claim is supported by writings of John the Deacon according to which Justin was Archbishop of Split in year 840 after Archbishop Petar which is mentioned in the Charter.\n\nAlthough the Charter is preserved in fragments it can be seen that the ruler \"(Dux Chroatorum)\" had almost unlimited power in the country, because Trpimir called himself \"the ruler of the Croats by the grace of God\". Charter proves the existence of Croats before Trpimir, because it confirms deed of donation given to the Archdiocese of Split by Trpimir's predecessor Mislav. In addition, Trpimir gave Church of St. George in Putalj and some other estates with associated serfs to the Archdiocese of Split. Charther shows that Croatia was a feudal state in formation and that the Croatian ruler had his state government which was made out of his courtiers and military and administrative officials, such as prefects and court chaplains. Trpimir also established the right of the Catholic Church to collect tithe. Feudal nature of the ruler's authority is confirmed by the fact that Trpimir had national territory and his own feudal domains. Although Trpimir acted as a real ruler, he was not formally independent, but was rather a vassal of the Successor of Frankish ruler in Italy, Lombardy king Lothair. On the basis of this Charter, it can be concluded that the Croatian state finally emerged in the third decade of the 9th century.\n\nThe question of authenticity of the Charter has emerged from the beginning of its historiographical research. Doubts about the authenticity stemmed from problems with the dating, misunderstanding of certain language terms, and also from the fact that the copies of the Charter passed through many hands and that the Charter itself is vague and contradictory in many parts because of that. Some of the evidences that the Charter is authentic are for example terms \"mancipatio\" and \"mancipare\". According to Lujo Margetić, these terms indicate the ancient Roman forms of acquiring property and were at the time slowly disappearing as knowledge of Corpus Juris Civilis was growing by the activity of glossators, but they also linger at least in Italy even in the 9th century AD. Trpimir's and Muncimir's documents are evidence that those terms were known in Croatia. Olga Perić also came to the similar results noting that at least two old and different language layers can be found in the text of the Charter. Some interesting observations in support of Charter authenticity were presented by Neven Budak. First observation refers to the name of people from the Trpimir's escort that are mentioned in the eschatocol of the Charter, which points out that all the names are national, Croatian names, and not Christian, unless of course those from the priests. This is understandable because it was a time when only traditional names were prevailing among newly baptized nations. Budak disputes the contention that the institution of chaplain as a court scribe did not exist in the 9th century, stating that it is known in Bavaria in the 8th century and that it was accepted by Carolingian dynasty.\n"}

{"id": "237663", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=237663", "title": "Civil list", "text": "Civil list\n\nA civil list is a list of individuals to whom money is paid by the government. It is a term especially associated with the United Kingdom and its former colonies of Canada and New Zealand. It was originally defined as expenses supporting the monarch. Morocco has a civil list defined in its constitution of 1996.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Civil List was, until 2011, the annual grant that covered some expenses associated with the Sovereign performing their official duties, including those for staff salaries, State Visits, public engagements, ceremonial functions and the upkeep of the Royal Households. The cost of transport and security for the Royal Family, together with property maintenance and other sundry expenses, were covered by separate grants from individual Government Departments. The Civil List was abolished under the Sovereign Grant Act 2011.\n\nFollowing the \"Glorious Revolution\" of 1688, the expenses relating to the support of the monarch were largely separated from the ordinary expenses of the State managed by the Exchequer. This was a reaction to the reigns of Charles II of England and James II of England (also known as James VII of Scotland), whose large revenues had made them independent of Parliament.\n\nIn 1697, Parliament under William III and Mary II fixed The Crown's peacetime revenue at £1,200,000 per year; of this about £700,000 was appropriated towards the Civil List. The Sovereigns were expected to use this to defray some of the costs of running the civil government (such as the Civil Service, judges' and ambassadors' salaries) and the payment of pensions, as well as the expenses of the Royal Household and the Sovereign's personal expenses. It was from this that the term \"Civil List\" arose, to distinguish it from the statement of military and naval expenses which were funded through special taxation.\n\nThe accession of George III in 1760 marked a significant change in royal finances. As his predecessor, George II, had failed to meet all of the specific costs of the civil government in accordance with the previous arrangement, it was decided by the Civil List Act 1760 that George III would surrender the hereditary revenues from the Crown Estate to Parliament for the duration of his reign, and in return Parliament would assume responsibility for most of the costs of the civil government. Parliament would continue to pay the Civil List, which would defray the expenses of the Royal Household and some of the costs of the civil government. George III, however, retained the income from the Duchy of Lancaster.\n\nOn the accession of William IV in 1830, the sum voted for the Civil List was restricted to the expenses of the Royal Household, removing any residual responsibilities associated with the cost of the civil government. This finally removed any links between the Sovereign and the cost of the civil government. On the accession of Queen Victoria, the Civil List Act 1837—which reiterated the principles of the civil list system and specified all prior Acts as in force—was passed. Upon the accession of subsequent monarchs down to Queen Elizabeth II, this constitutional arrangement was confirmed, but the historical term \"Civil List\" remained even though the grant had nothing to do with the expenses of the civil government.\n\nIn 1931 George V decided to eschew the £50,000 due to him from the Civil List as a result of the Great Depression. As Keeper of the Privy Purse, Sir Frederick Ponsonby wrote to Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald to say that George had felt it was possible to reject the grant by \"exercise of the most rigid economy\" and that Queen Mary and other royal family members were \"desirous that reductions in these grants should be made during this time of national crisis\".\n\nThe last British monarch to receive Civil List payments was Elizabeth II. The Civil List for her reign lasted from her accession in 1952 until its abolition in 2012. During this period the Queen, as head of state, used the Civil List to defray some of the official expenditure of the monarchy.\n\nOnly the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and the Queen Mother ever received direct funding from the Civil List. The Prince of Wales and his immediate family (the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and Prince Harry) received their income from the Duchy of Cornwall. The state duties and staff of other members of the Royal Family were funded from a parliamentary annuity, the amount of which was fully refunded by the Queen to the treasury. The Queen's consort (Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh) received £359,000 per year. The Queen was permitted to claim these amounts as a deduction against her gross income from personal investments and other sources—the net amount, after deductions, was subject to normal income tax.\n\nThe last two decades of the Civil List were marked by surpluses and deficits. Surpluses in the 1991–2000 Civil List caused by low inflation and the efforts of the Queen and her staff to make the Royal Household more efficient led to the accrual of a £35.3 million reserve by late 2000. Consequently, the Civil List was fixed at £7.9 million annually in 2001, the same amount as in 1991, and remained at that level until its abolition. The reserve was then used to make up the shortfall in the Civil List during the subsequent decade. The Civil List Act 1972 forbade parliament from reducing any of these payments.\n\nThe abolition of the Civil List was announced in the spending review statement to the House of Commons on 20 October 2010 by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne. In its place, he said, \"the Royal Household will receive a new Sovereign Support Grant linked to a portion of the revenue of the Crown Estate\". The Crown Estate is a statutory corporation, run on commercial lines by the Crown Estate Commissioners and generates revenue for HM Treasury every year (an income surplus of £210.7 million for the year ended 31 March 2010). This income is received by the Crown and given to the state as a result of the agreement reached in 1760 that has been renewed at the beginning of each subsequent reign. The Sovereign Grant Act 2011 received Royal Assent on 18 October 2011. Under this Act, the Sovereign Grant now funds all of the official expenditure of the monarchy, not just the expenditure previously borne by the Civil List.\n\nThese are pensions traditionally granted by the Sovereign from the Civil List upon the recommendation of the First Lord of the Treasury. The Civil List Act 1837 applied the condition that any new pensions should be \"granted to such persons only as have just claims on the royal beneficence or who by their personal services to the Crown, or by the performance of duties to the public, or by their useful discoveries in science and attainments in literature and the arts, have merited the gracious consideration of their sovereign and the gratitude of their country.\" Famous recipients include William Wordsworth, William Barnes, Geraldine Jewsbury, Margaret Oliphant, Christopher Logue, and Molly Parkin. (Lord Byron is often said to have received a civil list pension, but his mother was the actual recipient.) As of 1911, a sum of £1,200 was allotted each year from the Civil List, in addition to the pensions already in force. From a Return issued in 1908, the total of Civil List pensions payable in that year amounted to £24,665. In the financial year 2012-13 the annual cost of Civil List pensions paid to 53 people was £126,293. New Civil List pensions continue to be awarded occasionally.\n\nIn episode 3 of \"To Play the King\", Prime Minister Francis Urquhart (played by Ian Richardson) tells his political foe, the king (played by Michael Kitchen), that the government will take another look at the Civil List before holding a general election. The king observes that a full audit had been conducted the previous year, and Urquhart's proposed review appears vindictive.\n\nIn Canada the civil list was a common term during the pre-confederation period; it referred to the payment for all officials on the government payroll. There was much controversy as to whether the list would be controlled by the Governor or by the Legislative Assembly. The Assembly demanded control of all money matters, while the Governors worried that if the Assembly was given this power, then certain positions would be delisted. Eventually under the Baldwin-Lafontaine government, a compromise was reached with Lord Elgin.\n\nThe term \"civil list\" is no longer commonly used to describe the payment of civil servants in Canada, who are covered in the budgets of executive agencies.\n\nThe Civil List Act 1979 describes the funds provided for the Governor-General, Prime Minister, Cabinet Ministers and Members of Parliament.\n\nArticle 45 of the 2011 Amended Moroccan Constitution states that the King shall have a civil list. A similar provision was contained in Article 22 of the 1996 Amended Moroccan Constitution.\n\nThe Civil List and Gratuity Act provides a civil list and gratuity for the maintenance of the President of Singapore.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1870163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1870163", "title": "Cyfraith Hywel", "text": "Cyfraith Hywel\n\nCyfraith Hywel (; \"Laws of Hywel\"), also known as Welsh law (), was the system of law practised in medieval Wales before its final conquest by England. Subsequently, the Welsh law's criminal codes were superseded by the Statute of Rhuddlan in AD 1284 and its civil codes by Henry VIII's series of Laws in Wales Acts between 1535 and 1542.\n\nWelsh law was a form of Celtic law with many similarities to the Brehon law of Ireland and particularly the customs and terminology of the Britons of Strathclyde. It was passed down orally by jurists and bards and, according to tradition, only first codified during the reign of Hywel Dda in the mid-10th century. The earliest surviving manuscripts, however, are in Latin, date from the early 13th century, and show marked regional differences. The law is only known to have been revised by a few rulers (particularly Bleddyn ap Cynfyn, who was credited with revisions retained in the kingdom of Powys) but was obviously updated by jurists in response to changing jurisdictions and circumstances, so that the surviving manuscripts cannot be considered an accurate portrayal of Hywel's first code.\n\nNotable features of Welsh law include the collective responsibility of kindreds (Welsh: cenedl) for their members; the gavelkind inheritance of land among all and only male descendants; a status-based system of blood money (\"galanas\"); slavery and serfdom; the inability of foreigners to naturalize earlier than the fourth generation; and very lax treatment of divorce and legitimacy that scandalized the non-native clergy.\n\nThe laws include the \"laws of the court\", the laws laying down the obligations and entitlements of the king and the officers of his court and the \"laws of the country\" dealing with every other topic. In some versions of the laws some of the material in the laws of the country are split off into the \"justices' test book\" dealing with homicide, theft and the values of wild and tame animals and other items. Within each of these sections there are tracts of varying length dealing with different subjects, for example the law of women and the law of contracts. Civil law differed from most other codes of law in the rule that on a landowner's death his land was to be shared equally between his sons, legitimate and illegitimate. This caused conflict with the church, as under canon law illegitimate children could not inherit.\n\nOnce a case came to court, the method used to come to a decision was usually by compurgation. Under this system the person accused or the parties to a dispute would give their version under oath, following which they had to find a number of others who would take an oath that the principal's oath could be trusted. The number of compurgators required depended on the nature of the case. The judge or judges would then come to a decision. Capital punishment was only prescribed for a small number of crimes. Homicide was usually dealt with by the payment of compensation to the victim's family, while theft could be punished by death only if it was theft by stealth and the thief was caught with the goods in hand; the value of the goods stolen also had to exceed four pence. Most other offences were punished by a fine.\n\nMost of the surviving manuscripts of Welsh law start with a preamble explaining how the laws were codified by Hywel. The introduction to the Book of Blegywryd is a typical example:\n\nAs each of the manuscripts dates from centuries later than Hywel’s time, this statement cannot be used to date the event described above. Professor Huw Pryce has demonstrated that some of the prologues were developed in response to attacks on Welsh law by Church men and Nobles who wished to gain rights more akin to those enjoyed by Ecclesiastics and the aristocracy in England. In discussing Hywel’s association with the law, K. L. Maund suggests:\n\nOn the other hand, the Iorwerth versions, produced in Gwynedd, have exactly the same attribution of the law to Hywel and the council at Whitland as do the southern versions. It is more likely that Hywel’s name was used to lend some form of “ancestral authority\" to the laws.\n\nThe best that may be said of Hywel’s association with the law is that a folk memory recalled a revision and rejuvenation of the law during his reign. Other kings are said to have introduced later modifications to the laws, for example Bleddyn ap Cynfyn, king of Gwynedd and Powys in the mid 11th century.\n\nSome of the legal material, such as the tract on the Seven Bishop Houses of Dyfed, may be dated to a very early period of law. Other material bears comparison with Early Irish Law.\n\nAlthough there are a substantial number of manuscripts containing the law texts, there are no existing manuscripts of law texts dating back to the time of Hywel and Welsh law was continually being revised and updated. There has been some debate among scholars as to whether the laws were originally written in Welsh or Latin. The \"Surexit\" memorandum in the Lichfield Gospels is a record of the outcome of legal proceedings dating from the 9th century and written in Welsh, and though it is not a law manual it does indicate the use of Welsh legal terms at that time. The earliest manuscripts known are Peniarth 28, written in Latin but now generally thought to be a translation of a Welsh original, and Peniarth 29, known as the \"Black Book of Chirk\", written in Welsh. These are thought to date from the early or mid 13th century. There are a large number of law manuscripts, written mainly in Welsh but some in Latin, written between this period and the 16th century. Later manuscripts have been shown to reflect legal developments particularly in the Southern Welsh lordships. Apart from the full compilations there are shorter versions thought to have been working copies used by judges. However they are all usually considered to fall into three Redactions, known as the Cyfnerth Redaction, the Blegywryd Redaction and the Iorwerth Redaction.\n\n\nThe first part of the laws deal with the rights and duties of the king and the officers of the king's court. The order of precedence is set down: first the king, then the queen, then the or edling, the heir. Next come the officers of the court; the Iorwerth Redaction identifies twenty-four, of whom sixteen are the king's officers and eight the queen's officers. First in rank was the captain of the household troops, then the priest of the household, then the steward followed by the chief falconer, the court justice, the chief groom and the chamberlain. A list of additional officers follows, including such officers as the groom of the rein, the porter, the bakeress and the laundress. Each officer's entitlements and obligations are listed.\n\nIt introduces a number of legal terms. \"Sarhad\" could mean an insult or injury or the payment that was due to a person in the event of an insult or injury, and this varied according to the status of the person concerned, for example the queen or the edling's \"sarhad\" was one third that of the king. \"Galanas\" was a form of weregild and represented the value of a person's life in the event of a homicide and was set at three times the \"sarhad\", though the \"sarhad\" was also payable by the killer. \"Dirwy\" was a fine payable for crimes and \"camlwrw\" a smaller fine for less serious offences, while \"ebediw\" was a death duty payable to the deceased's lord. \"Sarhad\" and \"dirwy\" are still Welsh words meaning ‘insult’ and ‘fine’ respectively,\n\nThe origins of the various redactions are reflected in the relative position of the rulers of the Welsh kingdoms. The Iorwerth Redaction manuscripts proclaim the superiority of the king of Aberffraw, chief seat of the kingdom of Gwynedd, over the others, while the manuscripts from Deheubarth claim at least equality for the king of Dinefwr, chief seat of the southern kingdom.\n\nWhile Welsh law lays more emphasis on the powers of the king than the Brehon Law of Ireland, this is still restricted compared to many other codes. As Moore comments:\n\nFor the purposes of the laws, Welsh society was divided into five classes: the rulers, including the king (\"rhi\" or \"brenin\") over his kingdom and the lords over their fiefs; the free Welsh, including both the pedigreed aristocracy (\"boneddigion\" or \"uchelwr\") and the yeomen together; the Welsh serfs (\"taeogion\", \"ailltion\", or \"bileiniaid\"); foreigners resident in Wales (\"alltudion\"); and the slaves (\"caethion\"). The privileges, penalties, and obligations due by law varied with the social status of the person concerned.\n\nAt the time of Hywel's laws, \"Cymry\" the modern Welsh for all of the Welsh people apparently only applied to the free classes and not to serfs or slaves. However, none of them counted as a \"foreigner\" and, even if they moved from one Welsh \"kingdom\" (\"gwlad\") to another, they did not suffer that status but were considered fully native.\n\nThose from outside Wales were considered between serfs and slaves, forbidden to offer testimony, and obliged to pledge themselves to a native Welshman (even a serf) who would be responsible for them. This status could only be removed after three generations in the north and possibly as many as nine elsewhere, after which the foreigner's descendants were considered to be native serfs.\n\nThe position of women under Welsh law differed significantly to that of their Norman-English contemporaries. A marriage could be established in two basic ways. The normal way was that the woman would be given to a man by her kindred; the abnormal way was that the woman could elope with a man without the consent of her kindred. In this case her kindred could compel her to return if she was still a virgin, but if she was not she could not be compelled to return. If the relationship lasted for seven years she had the same entitlements as if she had been given by her kin.\n\nA number of payments are connected with marriage. \"Amobr\", or commutation-fee, was a fee payable to the woman's lord on the loss of her virginity, whether on marriage or otherwise. \"Cowyll\", or maiden-fee, was a payment due to the woman from her husband on the morning after the marriage, marking her transition from virgin to married woman. Dowry (\"agweddi\") was the amount of the common pool of property owned by the couple which was due to the woman if the couple separated before the end of seven years. The total of the agweddi depended on the woman's status by birth, regardless of the actual size of the common pool of property. If the marriage broke up after the end of 7 years, the woman was entitled to half the common pool. The portion that was immediately accessible during the marriage, consisting usually of linens, dishes, and other domestic items, was known as \"argyvrau\".\n\nIf a woman found her husband with another woman, she was entitled to a payment of six score pence (i.e. half a pound) the first time and a pound the second time; on the third occasion she was entitled to divorce him. If the husband had a concubine, the wife was allowed to strike her without having to pay any compensation, even if it resulted in the concubine's death. A woman could only be beaten by her husband for three things: for giving away something which she was not entitled to give away, for being found with another man, or for wishing a blemish on her husband's beard. If he beat her for any other cause, she was entitled to the payment of \"sarhad\". If the husband found her with another man and beat her, he was not entitled to any further compensation. According to the law, women were not allowed to inherit land. However, there were exceptions, even at an early date. A poem dated to the first half of the 11th century is an elegy for Aeddon, a landowner on Anglesey. The poet says that after his death his estate was inherited by four women who had originally been brought to Aeddon's court as captives after a raid and had found favour with him. The rule for the division of moveable property when one of a married couple died was the same for both sexes. The property was divided into two equal halves, with the surviving partner keeping one half and the dying partner being free to give bequests from the other half.\n\nMurder was regarded as an offence against the family rather than against society or the state. It was normally dealt with by the payment of blood money (\"galanas\") by the killer \"and\" his extended family to the family of the deceased. The base sum was computed by the social status and position of the victim. The \"galanas\" of the king of Deheubarth was set at an impossibly long line of impossibly perfect cattle to ensure it could never be met; the family of a murdered slave, meanwhile, received no \"galanas\", although the slave's owner was to be compensated for the loss. This sum might then be modified in certain situations (for example, an attack from ambush doubled the base fine). Upon the payment of the blood money, the victim's family was then legally bound to forgo its vengeance (\"dial\"). Murder by poison, however, carried the death penalty.\n\nAssault or offenses against honor were dealt with in a similar fashion, through a fine called \"sarhaed\". However, it only applied to the upper classes: any serf who struck a free man was to liable to have the offending limb removed.\n\nThe crime of rape was treated as a theft and remedied by the payment of another fine (\"dirwy\"), payment of which restored the woman's virginity for legal purposes. A man who could not pay the fine was to have his testicles removed.\n\nSimilarly, a convicted thief was imprisoned in the first instance, but a serf convicted for the third time was to have his hand removed. (Assuming he was not caught in the act: thieves caught with goods in hand more valuable than four \"ceiniogau\" were liable for hanging.) Such strong penalties led the Welsh to narrowly define \"theft\", however: forcible robbery was considered much less serious. Further, a hungry man who had passed at least three towns without receiving a meal could not be punished for stealing food.\n\nAiding and abetting including witnessing a killing and failing to protect the victim or receiving stolen property was also punished with \"dirwy\" fines.\n\nAlthough Hywel's commission generally recorded the traditions of the country, one modification they made was to end the right of nobles to trial by combat, finding it unjust.\n\nMedieval Welsh law placed a high value on compensation for any breach of the law. In particular, high and detailed compensation values\nwere given for each limb of the body. There are nine limbs of equal value (that is the hands, the eyes, the lips, the feet, and the nose) each of which is valued at 480 pennies, every other limb is carefully\nvalued and can be altered depending on various influencing factors.\n\nThe values given to eyes, ears, nose, lips, hands, and feet are identical; termed as the ‘Limbs of equal value’ they represent 12.7% of the standard \"galanas\" for a \"boneheddig\" (A \"boneheddig\" is a standard free-man, whose \"galanas\" is valued at 3780 pennies/ 63 cows). There are no additional complexities to any of these costs, except when it comes to ears. The Iorwerth manuscripts and LATIN A do not value the ear itself at 480 pennies, instead they differentiate between the loss of an ear and the loss of hearing. If the ear is lost but the victim can still hear, then the price lies at 160 pennies, whilst deafness (even without the loss of ear) retains the 480 penny value. This is a rare example of a ‘functional value\nbeing given where the loss of the function of the ear... is appreciated and not the organ itself’. Harris notes that although these members are all given equal value, it seems there is some underlying notion that some are perhaps more essential than others (at least in the Iorwerth and LATIN A texts) with hearing being more\nimportant than any of the other senses.\n\nFingers are valued at 80 pence each, whilst a thumb has a value of 180 pence which corresponds to its use in ‘gripping agricultural equipment or arms’. The Iorwerth and Cyfnerth 5 recensions value a finger nail at 30 pence, whilst the top of the finger to the first knuckle is valued (in the same texts) at 26 2/3 of a penny. The price of a fingernail as it is valued in Iorwerth and Cyfnerth is 0.8% of\nthe \"galanas\", and intriguingly the thumbnail in the Wessex tariff also stands at 0.8% of the \"wergild\" value for the man.[7] Harris argues that these similar percentages reflect the co-existence of two legal systems in Wales; the Welsh and the English.\n\nThe triad known as the \"Tri Arberygl Dyn\" (Three Dangerous wounds of man) specifies three injuries for which‘teyr punt a geyf y nep a archoller y gan y nep ay harchollo’ ‘He who is wounded shall have 3 pounds from him who wounds him’. These are; when a man is cut so that the brains can be seen, when a man is pierced so his entrails can be seen, and when one of the four posts of the body (the limbs) are broken.\n\nThe body parts appear to be classed for compensation based on how much use they have in society. The higher the use; the higher the compensation cost. Loss of hearing, for example, as well as loss of testes and/or penis incur very high redress rates, because their loss will cause either danger or an inability to continue lineage, which was highly important in such a kin-based society. The tongue is also particularly high because, as with the ear, it would have formed the primary means of communication for the victim.\n\nAlso notable are the different grades of compensation given to wounds depending on the degree of disfigurement produced by the wounding, with a differentiation between \"craith ogyfarch\"; a conspicuous scar which attracts remarks, and \"craith guiddiedig\"; a hidden scar which will therefore attract less remarks. The \"craith ogyfarch\" afforded the most compensation, but the value of the \"ogyfarch\" compensation varied according to its noticability. The three most conspicuous scars are given as those on a face (six score pence), on a hand (sixty pence), and on a foot (thirty pence), whilst a hidden scar is given only four pence. The Latin texts A and E ‘make provision for a cloak to cover facial disfigurement’ and front teeth were also accorded a higher value than other teeth.\n\nThe section on surety lays down the rules if a person acts as \"mach\" or surety, for example for a debt, and gives the provisions for various cases, such as where the debtor refuses to pay or denies the debt and where the surety denies the suretyship or contests the sum involved. Rules are also given for the giving and forfeiting of gages. Another aspect is \"amod\" or contract, usually made by the two parties calling \"amodwyr\" who are witnesses to prove the terms agreed by the parties. It is laid down that:\n\nIn what is thought to be an archaic survival in some versions of Iorwerth it is stated that women are not entitled to act as sureties or to give sureties. Later versions of this rule in Iorwerth state that women were entitled to give sureties, and could therefore enter into contracts, though they were still not allowed to act as sureties. In Colan, Cyfnerth and some of the Latin texts women could give sureties and could under certain circumstances act as sureties. This appears to indicate a gradual improvement in the legal position of women in this respect.\n\nThis is followed by land law, setting out the procedure in the event of rival ownership claims over land. Court was convened on the land itself, with both claimants calling witnesses to support their claims. In the Iorwerth Redaction, it is stated that the claimants were entitled to the representation by both types of lawyer - \"cyngaws\" and \"canllaw\". If both claims were deemed to have equal merit, the law allowed for the land to be shared equally between the two claimants.\n\nOn the death of a landowner (\"priodawr\") his immovable estate (land) passed in joint tenancy (\"cytir\") to his sons, similar to the gavelkind system of Kent. Then the youngest son partitioned (\"cyfran\") the land equally, and each brother took his share. Illegitimate sons were entitled to shares equal to those of legitimate sons, provided they had been acknowledged by the father. This provision differed the most from canon law; as the Iorwerth text puts it:\n\n\"Dadannudd\" is a son's claim to land which previously belonged to his father. A landowner's right to convey land was restricted; it was only allowed under certain circumstances with the consent of his kindred and coheirs (\"laudatio parentum\"). With the consent of the lord and the kindred, the landowner could use the living gage (\"prid\"). The land would be made over to a gagee (\"pridwr\") for a period of four years, and if the land had not been redeemed by the gagor (owner) or his heirs at the end of the four years, the gage could then be renewed for additional four-year periods. After three renewals (or 16 years total), the land passed permanently to the gagee.\n\nFrom the time of the fall of Rome, Wales was divided into numerous petty \"kingdoms\" (\"gwledydd\", \"peoples\") which were repeatedly unified and then redivided. It is frequently stated that Welsh law demanded the division of a kingdom between all the ruler's sons, but that is a misunderstanding of the inheritance law the crown itself was unitary but the king's \"lands\" (\"maertref\") were required to be divided among all of his acknowledged sons by whatever mother. This naturally weakened the position of the new king and that weakness, along with the long free and separate traditions of the various Welsh \"gwledydd\", then permitted disputes and civil wars among the family appanages. Further, by the time of Hywel, the kingdoms normally taken as independent Deheubarth, Powys, &c. were nominally subordinate to the elder line of the family in Gwynedd and bound to display that with annual gifts.\n\nThe confusion of the 11th century and the use of the Saxon loanword \"edling\" for the heir also seem to have clouded the issue. By law, the principal homestead (and presumably the realm) were to go to the king's eldest son, but this was subject to several important provisos:\n\nThe eldest son of a king who died before that was barred from direct inheritance but possessed the right to retake the throne himself on the attainment of majority. The number of princes rebelling just prior to their 30th year may even indicate that they were \"required\" to assert their rights at that point or lose them. If the eldest son were ineligible for whatever reason, his brothers, uncles, and first and second cousins were all considered legitimate substitutes. Likewise, even when the eldest son did inherit, other descendants of his great-grandfather were considered legitimate rulers and not usurpers if they were able to wrest control away from him.\n\nFinally, although our surviving editions of Hywel's law explicitly forbid inheritance by or through female members of the royal family, Hywel's line itself derived from lords of Man who had (allegedly) married into the dynasties of Gwynedd and Powys and there are numerous examples through the 11th century of kings asserting their legitimacy on account of royal mothers, despite surviving underage representatives of the male line of succession.\n\nThis is only a separate section in the Iorwerth Redaction; in the other versions the material is incorporated in the \"Laws of the country\" section. It is a compilation of the rules for dealing with the \"Three Columns of Law\", namely cases of homicide, theft and fire, and \"The Value of Wild and Tame\". There are also appendices dealing with joint ploughing and corn damage by stock.\n\n\"The value of wild and tame\" gives the values of various animals, for example:\n\nValues are also given for trees, equipment and parts of the human body. The value of a part of the body was fixed, thus a person causing the king to lose an eye would pay the same as if he had caused a villein to lose an eye. However he would also have to pay \"sarhad\", and this would be far greater for the king than for the villein.\n\nThe main administrative divisions of mediaeval Wales were the cantrefs, each of which was divided into several commotes. These were of particular importance in the administration of the law. Each cantref had its own court, which was an assembly of the \"uchelwyr\", the main landowners of the cantref. This would be presided over by the king if he happened to be present in the cantref, or if he was not present by his representative. Apart from the judges there would be a clerk, an usher and sometimes two professional pleaders. The cantref court dealt with crimes, the determination of boundaries and matters concerning inheritance. The commote court later took over most of the functions of the cantref court. The judges (Welsh \"ynad\") in Gwynedd were professionals, while in south Wales the professional judges worked together with the free landowners of the district, all of whom were entitled to act as judges.\n\nA person accused of a crime could deny the charge by denying it on oath and finding a certain number of persons prepared to go on oath that they believed his or her own oath, a system known as compurgation. The number of persons required to swear depended on the gravity of the alleged crime; for example denying a homicide could require 300 compurgators, while if a woman accused a man of rape, the man would have to find 50 men prepared to swear to his innocence. For lesser crimes a smaller number would be sufficient. Witnesses could also be called, including eyewitnesses of the crime (\"gwybyddiaid\"). A witness who has once been proved to have given false testimony on oath was barred from ever appearing as a witness again.\n\nThe task of the judge, having considered the case, was to determine what sort of proof was appropriate and which of the parties was to be required to produce proof, whether by the calling of witnesses, by compurgation or by pledges, then in the light of the proof to adjudicate on the case and impose the appropriate penalty in accordance with the law if a penalty was called for.\n\nAccording to the Iorwerth Redaction, a prospective judge had to be at least twenty-five years of age and his legal knowledge has to be approved by the Court Justice:\n\nIt was possible to appeal against a judge's decision, and the apellant could demand that the judge show the authority of a book for his judgment. The consequences for a judge could be serious if his judgement was reversed, involving a financial penalty equivalent to the value of his tongue as laid down in the values of the parts of the body. He would also be banned from acting as a judge in future.\n\nWelsh law usually applied in the Welsh Marches as well as the areas ruled by Welsh princes. In the event of a dispute, the first argument in the border regions might be about which law should apply. For example, when Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn was in dispute with Roger Mortimer about some lands, it was Gruffydd who wanted the case heard under English law and Mortimer who wanted Welsh law to apply. The matter went to the royal justices, who decided in 1281 that since the lands concerned lay in Wales, Welsh law should be used.\n\nWelsh law came to be a particularly important badge of nationhood in the 12th and 13th centuries, particularly during the struggle between Llywelyn the Last and King Edward I of England in the second half of the 13th century. Llywelyn stated:\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, John Peckham when involved in negotiations with Llywelyn on behalf of King Edward in 1282 sent Llywelyn a letter in which he denounced Welsh law, stating that King Hywel must have been inspired by the devil. Peckham had presumably consulted the Peniarth 28 manuscript which was apparently held in the library at St. Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury at this time. One of the features to which the English church objected was the equal share of land given to illegitimate sons. Following Llywelyn's death the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284 introduced English criminal law into Wales: \"in thefts, larcenies, burnings, murders, manslaughters and manifest and notorious robberies — we will that they shall use the laws of England\". Nearly two hundred years after Welsh law ceased to be used for criminal cases, the poet Dafydd ab Edmwnd (fl. 1450–80) wrote an elegy for his friend, the harpist Siôn Eos, who had accidentally killed a man in a tavern brawl in Chirk. Siôn Eos was hanged, and Dafydd ab Edmwnd laments that he could not have been tried under the more humane Law of Hywel rather than \"the law of London\".\n\nWelsh law was still used for civil cases such as land inheritance, contracts, sureties and similar matters, though with changes, for example illegitimate sons could no longer claim part of the inheritance. The Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542 brought Wales entirely under English law; when the 1535 Act declares the intention \"utterly to extirpe alle and singular sinister usages and customs\" belonging to Wales, Welsh law was probably the main target.\n\nThe last recorded case to be heard under Welsh law was a case concerning land in Carmarthenshire in 1540, four years after the 1536 Act had stipulated that only English law was to be used in Wales. Even in the 17th century in some parts of Wales there were unofficial meetings where points of dispute were decided in the presence of arbiters using principles laid down in Welsh law.\n\nAntiquarian interest in the laws continued, and in 1730 a translation by William Wotton was published. In 1841 Aneurin Owen edited an edition of the laws entitled \"Ancient laws and institutions of Wales\", and was the first to identify the various Redactions, which he named the \"Gwentian Code\" (Cyfnerth), the \"Demetian Code\" (Blegywryd) and the \"Venedotian Code\" (Iorwerth). His edition was followed by a number of other studies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nCarmarthenshire County Council has set up the Hywel Dda Centre in Whitland, with an interpretative centre and garden to commemorate the original council.\n\nContemporary Welsh Law is a term applied to the body of primary and secondary legislation generated by the National Assembly for Wales, according to devolved authority granted in the Government of Wales Act 2006. Each piece of Welsh legislation is known as an Act of the National Assembly for Wales. The first Assembly legislation to be officially proposed was called the NHS Redress (Wales) Measure 2008. These powers have been effective since May, 2007. It is the first time in almost 500 years that Wales has had its own laws, since Cyfraith Hywel was abolished and replaced by English law through the Laws in Wales Acts, passed between 1535 and 1542 by King Henry VIII of England.\n\nEllis Peters in her Cadfael cycle often uses the ancient Welsh laws. The novel called \"Monk's Hood\" mentions the \"Cyfraith Hywel\" (called Hywel Dda). A recognised son, born out of wedlock has an over-riding claim to his father's property. The manor is in Wales. His demand could be accepted because the manor, lying in Wales, is under Welsh law.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1985, the High Court ruled this did not constitute unfair dismissal.\n\nFlynn was raised a Roman Catholic, and graduated from University College, Galway. She began teaching Irish and history in 1978 at the Holy Faith Convent in New Ross, a girls' Catholic school run by the Sisters of the Holy Faith. In 1980–81, she began a relationship with Richie Roche, a separated father of three who ran a pub in the town. Divorce was illegal in Ireland at the time. The school principal warned her that parents had complained of the scandal and that she would be sacked if she continued; Flynn maintained that her private life was not the school's business. In November 1981 Flynn moved into Roche's house and in April 1982 announced her pregnancy to the new principal, Sister Mary Anna Power, who offered to arrange for her to give birth in London and put the child up for adoption. The same month the school manager said that she would be dismissed unless she changed her \"lifestyle\". Flynn gave birth in Ireland on 6 June 1982 and determined to raise the child with Roche. On 6 August, the manager said that because of her \"open rejection of the norms and behaviour and the ideals which [the] school exists to promote\" she must resign or be dismissed. She refused to resign and was dismissed on 22 August with effect from 20 November.\n\nOn 29 August 1982, Flynn told the principal she had contacted a solicitor and would contest the dismissal. In March 1983, she took her case to the Employment Appeal Tribunal, alleging unfair dismissal under the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, which prohibits pregnancy discrimination. In February 1984, the tribunal rejected her appeal. She appealed to the Circuit Court, where two parents of students testified at having made written complaints about Flynn to the school. Judge Noel Ryan upheld the tribunal verdict, commenting that the nuns had been too lenient with Flynn. On 8 March 1985 in the High Court, Declan Costello upheld Ryan's verdict, on the basis that her dismissal was not due to her pregnancy \"per se\" but rather to her non-marital relationship. Flynn could not afford an appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe case was the subject of much media comment and public controversy in the period. Colm Tóibín described the reports on the \"Gay Byrne Show\" as reminiscent of a Thomas Hardy novel. Feminist and liberal commentators at the time and in retrospect have seen it as one of a series of events illustrating a conservative Catholic society unsympathetic to women; others include the 1981 Kerry Babies case, the 1983 abortion referendum, the 1984 death of Ann Lovett, the 1985 moving statues, and the 1986 divorce referendum. The fact that Richie Roche was a Sinn Féin activist meant that RTÉ would not interview him for fear of breaching Section 31 of the Broadcasting Act. (Flynn herself was not in Sinn Féin.)\n\nFlynn was not a member of the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland (ASTI) union; an ASTI official later suggested members would have had mixed feelings about supporting her case. The Unfair Dismissals Act 1977 has been amended since 1985; however, Flynn herself, as well as political and legal commentators, have contended that the law would permit similar dismissal; in particular that section 37(1) of the Employment Equality Act 1998 allowed schools to sanction teachers for \"undermining the religious ethos of the institution\". This provision was weakened in 2015 for schools in receipt of public funding (which applies to virtually all religiously run schools).\n\nFlynn later give birth to a second child as well as raising Roche's three previous children. The couple ran public houses and married in a civil ceremony on 8 September 1997, the year divorce was legalised in Ireland after a 1996 referendum. Eileen Roche resumed teaching about 2005, in the Christian Brothers primary school. She died suddenly on 9 September 2008 and her funeral was held on 12 September 2008.\n\n\n\n"}

It was followed a few days later by the Essential National Industries and Designated Corporations Regulations 2011.\n\nOn 5 December 2006, Commodore Voreqe Bainimarama, head of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces, overthrew democratically elected indigenous nationalist conservative Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase, and took his place at the head of an \"interim government,\" composed of both civilian and military ministers. Bainimarama stated that his main reasons for overthrowing the Qarase government were that it was corrupt, and that it was conducting racially discriminatory policies against the country's Indo-Fijian minority - namely its policy of \"affirmative action\" in favour of the indigenous majority. In a speech publicly announcing the coup, he stated that Qarase's policies had \"divided the nation now and will have very serious consequences to our future generations.\" He promised to amend the race-based electoral rolls, so as to \"lead us into peace and prosperity and mend the ever widening racial divide that currently besets our multicultural nation\".\n\nSubsequently, his government abolished the Constitution and imposed strict censorship of the media.\n\nFor several months, there had been considerable concern, expressed particularly by foreign trades union organisations, about restrictions on the rights of unions in Fiji, including acts of violence against unionists.\n\nIn February 2011, Amnesty International expressed concern about \"the reported detention and beating of several trade unionists\" in Fiji.\n\nIn March, the Trades Union Congress in the United Kingdom sent a protest to the Fiji High Commission in London, and issued the following statement:\n\nIn July, Australia's Transport Workers Union threatened to disrupt flights to Fiji unless Qantas took steps to protect its Fiji-based workers \"from state-sanctioned violence.\" This followed claims by Fijian union members, particularly baggage handlers, that they had been punched, kicked and \"hit with rubber belts\" by soldiers questioning their loyalty to the government. The New Zealand Council of Trade Unions said it shared the Australian union's concerns, and issued the following statement: \"We are very concerned about the physical intimidation and beatings of union officials in Fiji and also the decrees that remove work rights\".\n\nIn August, the Australian Council of Trade Unions condemned the police break-up of a meeting of the Fiji Trades Union Congress in Nadi.\n\nThe same month, Brendan Barber, General Secretary of the British TUC, wrote again to the Fiji High Commissioner in London, to express\n\nThe New Zealand Council of Trade Unions and Amnesty International Aotearoa New Zealand held a protest following Urai's arrest for unlawful assembly. Helen Kelly, President of the CTU, stated that \"earlier in the year, Felix Anthony of the FTUC was physically assaulted. The regime is perpetrating a deliberate attack on trade union rights by issuing decrees making it almost impossible for unions to function and removing internationally recognized civil rights of freedom of assembly and collective bargaining.\"\n\nThe decree was officially issued by the President of Fiji, Epeli Nailatikau, whose role as head of State is an essentially ceremonial one. Its main stated objective is to \"ensure the present and continued viability and sustainability of essential national industries for the benefit of Fiji\".\n\nIts terms are as follows:\n\nThe Essential National Industries and Designated Corporations Regulations 2011 were issued by Commodore Bainimarama on 8 September \"in exercise of the powers vested in me by section 31\" of the Decree, to come into force the following day. They provided a list of the country's \"essential national industries\", as determined by Bainimarama. They are: the Australia & New Zealand Banking Group, the Bank of Baroda, the Bank South Pacific, the Westpac Banking Corporation, the Fiji Revenue & Customs Authority, Fiji International Telecommunications, Telecom Fiji, the Fiji Broadcasting Corporation, Air Pacific, the Fiji Electricity Authority, and the Water Authority of Fiji.\n\nAttorney General Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum played down the idea that there was anything exceptional about the Decree, during a press conference prior to its finalisation. He argued that \"some countries restrict any strikes in essential services\", and that \"the principle of essential services is not anything new\". In response to union reactions, he argued that the decree would actually preserve jobs: \"We have found in companies that are financially unstable that if certain steps aren’t taken, they could close down therefore there’ll be job losses. Unionists that are not employees don’t have a particular self interest in preserving or maintaining the life of the company. You have to maintain the life of the company to make sure jobs are secure\".<ref name=\"face/off\">\"Union/govt face off: Decree deepens division\" , \"Islands Business\"</ref>\n\nThe \"Fiji Times\", subject to government censorship, reported simply that \"[t]he terms of the Essential National Industries (Employment) Decree 2011 [...] will govern the labour laws of the declared enterprises, ensuring the viability and sustainability of the industries while protecting fundamental workers' rights\". It quoted Sayed-Khaiyum's statement that \"[t]he Government takes providing for and protecting workers' rights very seriously\".\n\nThe \"Fiji Sun\" published an explanatory article by the Ministry of Information, including a list of \"frequently asked questions\" to reassure readers. To the question \"Does the decree remove workers’ right to strike, as some have claimed?\", the answer provided is: \"No. The decree upholds the fundamental principle that workers may strike. Just as many other countries do, it makes it subject to certain conditions, including providing employees with a vote in favour or against it.\" And to the question \"Are employers allowed to impose terms and conditions on workers?\", the answer given is: \"A due process must be followed as set out in the decree, involving good faith negotiations for at least 60 days in the case of a replacement agreement. Only after that would an employer have the right to implement new terms and conditions. Employees would have the right to appeal to the Minister for a review of the new terms.\"<br>\nThe final question is \"What is your response to the claim that the Government has wiped out decades of advances for its workers?\", with the government responding:\n\nNo public protests or demonstrations are allowed in Fiji, but the Fiji Trades Union Congress issued a statement saying the Decree \"offers major weapons to the employers to utilise against unions [...] It outlaws professional trade unionists, eliminates existing collective agreements, promotes a biased system of non-professional bargaining agents to represent workers, severely restricts industrial action, strengthens sanctions against legally striking workers and bans overtime payments and other allowances for workers in 24-hour operations\". Attar Singh, General Secretary for the Fiji Islands Council of Trade Unions, said: \"We have never seen anything worse than this decree. It is without doubt designed to decimate unions [...] by giving [employers] an unfair advantage over workers and unions\".\n\nAmnesty International condemned the Decree as \"a breathtaking abuse of fundamental rights [which] takes away nearly all collective bargaining rights in essential companies [and] virtually abolishes the right to strike\". It added: \"Fundamental human rights are at stake, including the right to freedom of association and assembly, and the right to organise. Amnesty International stands steadfast in solidarity with workers in Fiji and the Fiji labour movement in their struggle to defend their rights.\"\n\nJuan Somavia, Director-General of the International Labour Organization, stated:\n\nMahendra Chaudhry, leader of the Fiji Labour Party, published a statement in July which did not specifically mention the Decree but addressed the government's broader policies in relation to trade unions:\n\nShaista Shameem, former director of the Fiji Human Rights Commission, who had at first supported the 2006 military coup, stated that \"many rights have been completely diminished or even removed\" by the Decree. She added that it showed the Bainimarama government was no longer interested in consensual policy-making.\n\nIn October, during the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Australia, Ged Kearney, President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, said that, within the Commonwealth, the worst abuses of workers' rights were currently occurring in Fiji and in Swaziland. The Commonwealth Trade Union Group called for condemnation of the Decree.\n\nSayed-Khaiyum dismissed the criticism, saying much of it was based on \"misinformation\", and on people trying to misrepresent the situation in Fiji.\n\nIn late October and early November, Fijian Trades Union Congress leaders Daniel Urai and Felix Anthony were both separately arrested, and reportedly held without charge. The Australian government said the Fiji authorities were \"targeting and intimidating trade unionists\".\n\n"}

The Act's structure of exercising authority through a network of appointed boards was also viewed as being too decentralized. In April 1997, the FDMA received Royal Assent, and it was brought into force in April 1998. \n\nIn contrast to the FDRA, a farmer is defined as being any individual or entity \"that is engaged in farming for commercial purposes and that meets any prescribed criteria,\" and only insolvent farmers may apply for a financial review and mediation with all of the farmer's creditors (either with or without a stay of proceedings). As in the FDRA, \"farming\" included the production or raising of any animal or thing on a farm, and it was declared that:\n\nA stay of proceedings under the FDMA operates \"notwithstanding any law\", which has been interpreted to mean that it also suspends of petition of bankruptcy under the \"Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act\".\n\nIn place of the former Farm Debt Review Boards, administrators are either appointed or engaged by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada to administer the Act, and they can enter into agreements to engage mediators and experts. Where an administrator receives an application from an insolvent farmer, they must inform all the farmer's secured and unsecured creditors and (where the Minister is guarantor of any debt) the Minister, issue a stay of proceedings for 30 days where it has been requested, and (after a preliminary review of the farmer’s financial affairs) make a determination as to whether the farmer is actually eligible to make such an application.\n\nIn connection with the application:\n\nBefore enforcing any remedy against a farmer's property, or commencing any proceedings \"for the recovery of a debt, the realization of any security or the taking of any property of a farmer,\" a secured creditor must give written notice of intention to do so, together with advising the farmer of his right to apply for a stay of proceedings, and copies must be given to the farmer and administrator at least 15 business days before doing so. The holder of a guarantee is not considered a secured creditor nor obliged to give a FDMA notice, unless that guarantor is a farmer and has provided collateral security in support of the guarantee.\n\nEnforcement involves a complex interplay between the FDMA and other relevant statutes. In Manitoba, the process is characterized thus:\n\n\nThe Act's mandatory requirements have been strictly interpreted by the courts. For example, it has been held that a farmer cannot waive the secured creditor's obligation to given notice of intention to enforce security, even where it has been included in a mediation agreement. However, a stay cannot affect the appointment already in effect of an interim receiver for the purposes of preserving the estate of a bankrupt for the benefit of creditors, as it is not a proceeding for the recovery of a debt.\n\nBecause the Act covers only farming operations that are operated \"with a commercial purpose\", the courts have devised a list of factors to consider whether such is the case:\n\n\n"}

The law aims to regulate the right to informational self-determination. The law was published on July 5, 2010 in the Official Gazette and entered into force on July 6, 2010. Its provisions apply to all natural or legal persons who carry out the processing of personal data in the applicable exercise of their activities. Companies such as banks, insurance companies, hospitals, schools, telecommunications companies, religious organizations, and professionals such as lawyers, doctors, and others, are required to comply with the provisions of this law.\n\nPersonal data, according to Article 3 Section V of the Act, is any information that could identify a person.\n\nBefore issuing the LFPDPPP in Mexico this right was expressly recognized only by the Federal Law of Transparency and Access to Public Government Information (applying to the public sector) and in the Law on Protection of Personal Data in the State of Colima (public and private).\n\nDue to the regulatory landscape needed to meet international commitments, it was considered necessary to issue a law on the matter, so there would be a backup in the information.\n\nLaw takes the contents of the second paragraph of Article 16 of the Constitution and grant holders called \"ARCO rights\" whose acronym corresponds to:\n\nAccess : holders can know if their data is being processed.\nCorrection : the right to request that their data be modified.\nCancellation : holders may request that their data be canceled from the database for good cause.\nOpposition : the right of individuals to prevent treat your information.\nChapter IV Exercise of the rights of access, rectification, cancellation and opposition\n\nThose responsible are obliged to process the requests for access, rectification, cancellation and opposition that made the headlines, for which purpose shall appoint a person or creating a department of personal data, which is responsible for responding to requests within the time prescribed by law. In this chapter the ways in which it can be fulfilled with these rights are also noted, and the reasons why some of them may be denied.\n\nWhen the responsible party intends to transfer the data holder shall inform this fact in its privacy notice, requiring the consent of the holder, unless you apply any of the exceptions contemplated by this chapter.\n\nThe first record is in the reform in 2007 to Article 6 of the Constitution, in which a second paragraph is adicionaba this paragraph, laying the groundwork regarding the right to information (transparency), including the protection of personal data from public institutions, recognizing the rights of access and rectification. 3\n\nIn this reform 4 a second paragraph to Article 16 is added, and states that everyone has the right to protection of personal data and to exercise the rights called \"ARC\" (access, rectification, cancellation and opposition).\n\nThe Constitution also states that right may only be limited for reasons of national security provisions of public policy, public security or public health or to protect the rights of others. The LFPDPPP meanwhile, collects these assumptions within Article 4.\n\nIn this reform in May it empowered the Congress to legislate on the protection of personal data held by individuals, through the addition of the XXIX-O moiety. The justification for granting that power to the Federal Legislature was that personal data are used in various commercial transactions and trade is regulated at the federal level.\n\nArticles 1 and 2 of the LFPDPPP point out that the objectives of it are ensuring the privacy of persons (natural) and their right to informational self-determination, and that its provisions apply to non-automated or automated processing of personal information perform (the \"Responsible\") individuals or companies, with certain exceptions (personal purposes and carrying on the credit information). In this chapter the central terms of this regulation, among which are fundamental concepts of sensitive personal data, head, head, manager, third and treatment are defined.\n\nGlobally it recognized the existence of two models in terms of protection of personal data : general and sector.\n\nThe general model is adopted by most countries, especially the European Union and among its features are:\n\nThere is only one regulatory body in the field and an authority responsible for compliance.\nProvided the consent of the holders for the processing of data is required.\nTransfers to countries without an adequate level of protection is prohibited.\nFor its part, the industry model is applied by the United States and has the following characteristics:\n\nThere is no single legal instrument governing the matter, the various agencies can issue regulations as they deem appropriate for their industry.\nVarious authorities, within the scope of their competence. They are responsible for ensuring the protection of this right.\nThe consent of the holders for the treatment of the data is presumed unless they express their refusal.\nThis scheme operates under self-regulation.\n\nThe law takes the general model the principles of legality, consent, information, quality, purpose, loyalty, proportionality and accountability.\n\nAre important principles of consent, information and purpose, under which managers can only make the processing of personal data if owning them give their consent for the purposes outlined in the privacy notice .\n\nThe Act states that the IFAI (called Federal Institute of Access to Information and Data Protection from the reform of July 5, 2010 6 ) will be the authority to monitor and verify compliance with the Personal Data Act and as procedures to process rights protection, verification and sanction (Chapters VII, VIII and IX). In addition, the law states that the Ministries may issue provisions in this field, giving special powers to the Ministry of Economy .\n\nThis procedure begins with an application by the owner of the data before the IFAI, if it considers that the charge unreasonably denied access, rectification, cancellation and opposition of their data. The section in question states the procedure and time limits in which this procedure will be the grounds for inadmissibility and dismissal as well as the appeal proceeding against the resolution issued by the Institute.\n\nWithin this chapter catalog of violations of the law and their correlative sanctions lists. The law provides for such sanctions, fines ranging from 100 to 320.000 days of minimum wage in the Federal District, which may be increased for repeated infringement, and will double when violations are related to the processing of sensitive personal data. In accordance with the minimum wage in Mexico City in 2013, the fines range from $6476.00 (minimum) and $20'723,200.00 (maximum). 7\n\nThis procedure will begin when those responsible fail to comply with the resolutions issued by the IFAI, or when the authority presumed the existence of some sort of default. The form and deadlines to substantiate this procedure is regulated by the rules of procedure.\n\nIFAI is empowered to initiate disciplinary proceedings in case, derived from processing of rights protection procedures and verification has detected a breach of the principles and provisions of the Act. The form and deadlines to substantiate This procedure is governed by the rules of procedure.\n\nThe law provides for prison sentences ranging from three months to five years in prison, same may also be doubled when behaviors are related to sensitive personal data.\n\nPrivacy notice is a text that will explain to the data owner how the data will be used, and is generated in print or electronic (appears as a link on a Web page). The law and its regulations mentioned in several articles that will shape this privacy notice. Additionally, on January 17, 2013 the Ministry of Economy published in the Official Journal in August Federation guidelines for generating the Privacy Notice, in order to minimize the need for them to have recourse to private companies for advice in its creation. The publication of three forms differ Privacy Notice: Integral, Simplified and Short, depending on your application.\n\nThe Personal Data Act passed by the Mexican Congress includes elements of general and sectoral models, and stands as a necessary policy instrument to protect the privacy of individuals with regard to treatment that they may give other individuals regarding their personal information. Of its provisions it shows that the data of individuals are protected from all angles, under which the information provided by individuals in their capacity as clients in hiring all kinds of services or as workers in their places of work, among many other aspects, are protected by the LFPDPPP.\n\n"}

The Declaration was issued in Harare, Zimbabwe, on 20 October 1991, during the twelfth Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. It reaffirmed the political principles laid out in the Singapore Declaration of twenty years before, and (along with the Singapore Declaration) is considered one of the two most important documents to the Commonwealth's uncodified constitution.\n\nThe Singapore Declaration had committed the Commonwealth to several principles in 1971: world peace and support for the United Nations; individual liberty and egalitarianism; opposition to racism; opposition to colonialism; the eradication of poverty, ignorance, disease, and economic inequality; free trade; institutional co-operation; multilateralism; and the rejection of international coercion. The Harare Declaration reaffirmed all these except the last. It also emphasised in particular a few of the principles and values mentioned in Singapore as integral to the Commonwealth project:\n\n\nAt Harare, the Heads of Government dedicated themselves to applying these principles to then-current issues, such as the end of the Cold War, the near-completion of decolonisation, and the impending end of the apartheid government in South Africa. In this sense, it is considered to have set the Commonwealth on a new course, distinct from that followed before.\n\nThe next part of the declaration details the purpose of the Commonwealth, and the activities in which it ought to engage to further the values expounded.\n\nCritical to the document is the removal of a reference to the opposition to international coercion, which had been included in the Singapore Declaration. The implication at Singapore was that not even the Commonwealth itself had any right to enforce its other core values, as they could only be enforced by using coercive powers. This apparent conflict was resolved at Harare, and further clarified by the Millbrook Commonwealth Action Programme, which clearly mandated the Commonwealth to concern itself with its members' internal situations.\n\n"}

As a result,Communications Surveillance may only occur when prescribed by law necessary to achieve legitimate aim, and proportionate to the aim used.\nThe document consists of 13 principles developed to provide society groups, industry, governments, and others with a framework to assess whether current and proposed surveillance laws or statutes conflict with International Human Rights law.\n\nThe inception of the principles occurred as a result of a meeting between over 40 experts in privacy and security in Brussels, October 2012. After the initial consultation, a second meeting in Rio de Janeiro took place in December 2012 with the participation of the United Nations Special Rapporteur. Global consultation followed via conference calls every month between January and May 2013.\nThe drafting process, led by Access Now, EFF and Privacy International, along with several NGO's, Criminal Lawyers, Human rights advocates and privacy advocates were finalized and published for the first time on 10 July 2013 online at www.necessaryandproportionate.org.\n\nIn September 2013 at the 24th session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, they were launched officially.\n\nThe principles have now been adopted globally by more than 400 organizations. The global adoption necessitated a number of primarily superficial textual changes in the language of the document for the purposes of translation. This occurred between March and May 2014.\n\nThe effect and intention of the principles remained the same, and the final and authoritative version of the document was then launched in May 2014.\n\nThe initial release followed a report from the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression and Opinion in April 2013, which highlights the widespread practice of states surveying communications, stating that such surveillance severely undermines citizens' ability to enjoy a private life, freely express themselves and enjoy their other fundamental human rights.\n\nIn July 2013 the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, emphasized the importance of applying human right standards and democratic safeguards to surveillance and law enforcement activities:\"While concerns about national security and criminal activity may justify the exceptional and narrowly-tailored use of surveillance programmes, surveillance without adequate safeguards to protect the right to privacy actually risk impacting negatively on the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\"\n\nThe purpose of the principles was to provide civil society groups, states, the courts, legislative and regulatory bodies, industry and others with a framework to evaluate whether current or proposed surveillance laws comply with International Human Rights.\n\nThe concern was that key protections to privacy had been eroded away with technological advancements, therefore needed robust support in some areas to raise international human rights to the standards which had developed in the pre-digital age.\n\nThe following is a summary of the document containing the principles. All below is source from the actual document itself, except where noted.\n\nThe preamble of the document recognizes that Communications Surveillance interferes with the Right to privacy, therefore can only be used when it is prescribed by law, necessary to achieve a legitimate aim, and proportionate to the aim pursued. The view of the document is that existing human rights law has not kept up with the progression of technology. The preamble states that the threat to these rights combined with the increase in popularity of using communications content and metadata that states are not placing \"sufficient restrictions on how they can be subsequently used by States\".\n\nTo get the correct scope and purpose of application for the document, it is required to be read and interpreted as part of a larger framework rather than as individual principles.\nApplication of this document is to apply both within states and extra territorially, regardless of purpose.\n\nIt is to apply for protection of the individual from the state, and also states there is an obligation of states to protect individuals from non-state actors.\n\nThe document states that unless the principles are applied this way, a State conducting Communications Surveillance may not meet International Human Rights obligations. The principles are stated to \"articulate the duties and obligations of States when engaging in Communications Surveillance\".\n\nThis section of the document is dedicated to the interpretation of certain terms found throughout the document, and highlighting that some of the legal definitions used may not have effectively kept pace with technological change, and require reiteration. \nThe principles state that the because of the increased ability of communications surveillance, the existing legal framework which currently distinguishes between 'content' and 'non-content' is no longer appropriate, and protection from all types of surveillance should be given a higher legal priority.\n\nAny limitation imposed on an International Human Rights must be prescribed by law. Sufficient notice should be given if a proposed law is going to limit one of these rights. The law should be clear, and given periodic review to ensure it remains effective given the speed of technological development.\n\nCommunications surveillance should only be used by permitted state authorities where necessary in a democratic society. Any situation where discrimination arises should not be used.\n\nSurveillance laws should be limited to those which are necessary to achieve a legitimate aim, or where there are multiple means but Communications Surveillance is the least intrusive method on International Human Rights. The onus of establishing necessity should remain with the state\n\nAny communications surveillance authorized by law must be appropriate for the legitimate aim it is fulfilling.\n\nCommunications Surveillance is regarded as a highly intrusive act, and therefore must consider the sensitivity and severity of the situation. The state should establish the following prior to conducting communications surveillance:\n\nThe authority determining the validity of the communications surveillance must be independent of those conducting the surveillance, and be competent when making these decisions.\n\nThat everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by a competent judicial authority. Due process can be used interchangeably with \"procedural fairness\" and \"natural justice\"\n\nThose subjects of Communication Surveillance should be given the opportunity to challenge the decision when a decision authorizing Surveillance has been issued. The materials presented in support of the application should be available for those subjects. Delay in notification is acceptable where notification would frustrate the purpose of communication surveillance and authorization is granted by a competent judicial authority.\n\nInformation about use and amount of Communication Surveillance should be available to those who request it. States should provide the requestor with information sufficient to ascertain the nature of the request and determine the size of both the request and those who will be affected by it. Records of requests for communications surveyed should also be published.\n\nStates should establish an independent position to oversee the use of Communications Surveillance and to ensure transparency and accountability. The person(s) in this position would have sufficient authority to access all potentially relevant information, to assess whether the State is making legitimate use of its lawful capabilities, to evaluate whether the State has met its transparency obligations, and to make public determinations as to the lawfulness of those actions. The document in this instance makes reference to the United Kingdom's Interception of Communications Commissioner as an example of such an independent oversight mechanism.\n\nStates should not require those service providers or software/hardware vendors to build surveillance/monitoring capability into their systems. People have a right to express themselves anonymously.\n\nWhere a state has entered into a mutual legal assistance treaty(MLAT) or other multi-jurisdictional agreement where more than one legal jurisdiction overlaps, the laws that apply are those which have the higher level of protection for the individual. MLAT's should also be transparent, publicly available and subject to guarantees of procedural fairness\n\nCommunications surveillance by third parties should be prohibited with sufficient penalties. Protection for whistle-blowers should be enacted. Any information obtained by means not consistent with these principles should be inadmissible as evidence. Once information collected by communications surveillance has been used for the purpose for which it was collected it should be promptly destroyed or returned.\n\nIn October 2013, The Principles were promoted in a brief filed before the President's Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies. They claim that \"In a world of ever more complex technology, it is increasingly unclear whether the distinction between \"meta-data\" and other information carries much weight.\"\n\nThe Center for Democracy and Technology released a report noting overlap between the Principles and a December 9, 2013 proposal by tech groups such as AOL, Apple, Facebook, Google, Linkedin, Microsoft, Twitter, and Yahoo!.\n\nNow, the principles have over 400 organizations from across the world supporting the principles along with over 40 Experts, Academics and prominent individuals from over 17 countries, and 6 elected officials or political parties from 5 countries.\n\nThe principles are now being used as model for reform of surveillance law and policy around the world and to provide a benchmark for measuring whether a State's surveillance practices comply with International Human Rights Law.\n\n"}

Ambassador Punke also concurrently serves as the U.S. Ambassador to the World Trade Organization (WTO). \n\nOn May 2, 2013, President Obama nominated Michael Froman to succeed Ambassador Ron Kirk as the U.S. Trade Representative. The Senate confirmed Froman on June 19, 2013, and he was sworn into office on June 21, 2013.\n\nThe USTR participates in the World Trade Organization, which is currently in the Doha Development Round. This is partially managed by the USTR Office of WTO and Multilateral Affairs (WAMA). Relevant WTO agreements include the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and the Generalized System of Preferences.\n\nThere are two key advisory committees when it comes to agriculture. These two are the Agricultural Policy Advisory Committee (APAC) and the Agricultural Technical Advisory Committees (ATAC). APAC is made up of 34 organizations. ATAC is made up of 6 groups. These groups being Animal and Animal Products, Fruits and Vegetables, Grains, Feed, Oilseeds, and Planting Seeds, Sweeteners and Sweetener Products, Tobacco, Cotton, and Peanuts, and Processed Foods. APAC and ATAC allow the private sector to play a role in the U.S. government when it comes to trade. \n\nIn Agriculture, Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) play a big role. As stated, “For 16 of the 20 countries that the U.S. has FTAs with, U.S. exporters will face zero tariffs on 98% or more of agricultural goods once the agreements are fully implemented.”\n\nGlobal trade is one area America excels. They also have the world’s largest economy. Being competitive allows an increase in productivity and the growth of the economy. Expanding and shifting production has increased productivity and the county’s economic growth rate as well. “Exports have contributed nearly a third of economic growth since mid-2009, and account for approximately 13.5 percent of our economy”.\n\nUSTR uses enforcement to secure U.S. trading. This is especially keen to American workers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses. It is interpreted to be fair and open, making sure that everyone follows it. \n\nSome trade includes overlap with environmental policies. Wildlife trafficking, illegal logging, and marine conservation and protection are a few examples of this overlap.\n\nThe purchasing done under the government makes up 10 to 15 percent of the country’s GDP. In 1979, the first major Government Procurement Agreement appeared. Relations with Canada and Europe are especially noticeable in government procurement. \n\nThe Office of Small Business, Market Access, and Industrial Competitiveness (SBMAIC) manages manufactured goods that the United States exports. Two of the biggest goals are to expand export opportunities and strengthen enforcement of trade rules. Industrial tariffs are a huge commodity, for approximately 96 percent of U.S. merchandise imports are nonagricultural goods. \n\nThe Office of Intellectual Property and Innovation (IPN) focuses heavily on intellectual property laws and enforcing them worldwide. Trade agreements, the annual Special 301 review and report, World Trade Organization, and pharmaceutical and medical technology industries are all key areas.\n\nThe Labor office holds the United States responsible in making sure they follow all labor laws. Worker’s participation and rights is looked at thoroughly through this office. \n\nPreference programs are used as aiding other countries. It provides greater access to the U.S. market.\n\nThe Office of Services and Investment partakes in anything involving services, investment, and digital trade relevant to U.S. trade policy. International Investment provides both economic growth and protection for American workers. Services allows the world to connect. Through businesses, technology, retail, and all other forms of services, people interact globally. In the United States, service industries make up two thirds of the GDP and four out of five private-sector jobs.\n\nSmall businesses are significant in U.S. trade because they account for 98 percent of the country’s exports. The top exports going to Canada, Mexico, China, Japan, and the United Kingdom. \n\nThe Office of Textiles is in charge of both textiles and apparel. It works closely with Congress, domestic partners, and international ones. \n\nWorldwide aid and domestic funding related to trade are coordinated through the USTR. \n\nThe World Trade Organization (WTO), Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) all have an impact in trade. The WTO deals heavily with FTAs.  Licensing and trade barriers are addressed here. APEC facilitates trade with Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, China, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, the Russian Federation, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Thailand, The United States of America, and Vietnam. The U.S. also has a relationship with the ASEAN. ASEAN comprises of Brunei Darussalam, Burma, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Lastly, OECD accounts for 78 percent of the entire world’s GDP and has 34 democracies in Europe, North America, the Pacific Rim, and Latin America in the organization. \n\nThe \"National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers\" (National Trade Estimate or NTE) is an annual series that surveys prepared by the USTR, which reports significant foreign barriers to U.S. exports. Since 1986, the NTE provides, where feasible, quantitative estimates of the impact of these foreign practices on the value of U.S. exports. Information is also included on actions taken to eliminate barriers. It is based on information provided by USTR, the U.S. Departments of Commerce and Agriculture, and other agencies and sources.\n\nThe Special 301 Report is prepared annually by the USTR under Section 182 as amended of the Trade Act of 1974. The Act states that the USTR must on an annual basis, by April of each year:\nidentify those foreign countries that deny adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights, or deny fair and equitable markets access to United States persons that rely upon intellectual property protection, and those foreign countries identified under\" this \"paragraph that are determined by the Trade Representative to be priority foreign countries\". The Act defines \"priority foreign countries\" as \"those foreign countries that have the most onerous or egregious acts, policies, or practices that deny adequate and effective intellectual property rights, or deny fair and equitable market access to United States persons that rely upon intellectual property protection, whose acts, policies, or practices described in\" this \"paragraph have the greatest adverse impact (actual or potential) on the relevant United States products, and that are not entering into good faith negotiations, or making significant progress in bilateral or multilateral negotiations to provide adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights.\n\nThe Uruguay Round Agreement Act furthermore states that countries may be identified under Special 301 \"taking into account the history of intellectual property laws and practices of the foreign country, including any previous identifications\" and \"the history of efforts of the United States, and the response of the foreign country, to achieve adequate and effective protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights\". It also states that compliance with the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights does not include a country from being identified as denying \"adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights\".\n\nIn 2006, along with the International Intellectual Property Alliance, the USTR published a list of places where large-scale copyright infringement takes place in the Special 301 Report. Since 2010, the notorious markets report has been published as a separate report.\n\nAs of , there are ten living former Trade Representatives (with all Representatives that have served since 1989 still living), the oldest being Frederick Dent (served 1975–1977, born 1922). The most recent and recently serving Representative to die was Clayton Yeutter (served 1985–1989, born 1930) on March 4, 2017. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "18938758", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18938758", "title": "Open-source model", "text": "Open-source model\n\nThe open-source model is a decentralized software development model that encourages open collaboration.\nA main principle of open-source software development is peer production, with products such as source code, blueprints, and documentation freely available to the public. The open-source movement in software began as a response to the limitations of proprietary code. The model is used for projects such as in open-source appropriate technology, and open-source drug discovery.\n\nOpen source promotes universal access via an open-source or free license to a product's design or blueprint, and universal redistribution of that design or blueprint. Before the phrase \"open source\" became widely adopted, developers and producers used a variety of other terms. \"Open source\" gained hold with the rise of the Internet. The open-source software movement arose to clarify copyright, licensing, domain, and consumer issues.\n\nGenerally, open source refers to a computer program in which the source code is available to the general public for use or modification from its original design. Open-source code is meant to be a collaborative effort, where programmers improve upon the source code and share the changes within the community. Code is released under the terms of a software license. Depending on the license terms, others may then download, modify, and publish their version (fork) back to the community.\n\nMany large formal institutions have sprung up to support the development of the open-source movement, including the Apache Software Foundation, which supports community projects such as the open-source framework Apache Hadoop and the open-source HTTP server Apache HTTP.\n\nThe sharing of technical information predates the Internet and the personal computer considerably. For instance, in the early years of automobile development a group of capital monopolists owned the rights to a 2-cycle gasoline-engine patent originally filed by George B. Selden. By controlling this patent, they were able to monopolize the industry and force car manufacturers to adhere to their demands, or risk a lawsuit.\n\nIn 1911, independent automaker Henry Ford won a challenge to the Selden patent. The result was that the Selden patent became virtually worthless and a new association (which would eventually become the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association) was formed. The new association instituted a cross-licensing agreement among all US automotive manufacturers: although each company would develop technology and file patents, these patents were shared openly and without the exchange of money among all the manufacturers. By the time the US entered World War II, 92 Ford patents and 515 patents from other companies were being shared among these manufacturers, without any exchange of money (or lawsuits).\n\nEarly instances of the free sharing of source code include IBM's source releases of its operating systems and other programs in the 1950s and 1960s, and the SHARE user group that formed to facilitate the exchange of software. Beginning in the 1960s, ARPANET researchers used an open \"Request for Comments\" (RFC) process to encourage feedback in early telecommunication network protocols. This led to the birth of the early Internet in 1969.\n\nThe sharing of source code on the Internet began when the Internet was relatively primitive, with software distributed via UUCP, Usenet, IRC, and Gopher. BSD, for example, was first widely distributed by posts to comp.os.linux on the Usenet, which is also where its development was discussed. Linux followed in this model.\n\nThe term \"open source\" was first proposed by a group of people in the free software movement who were critical of the political agenda and moral philosophy implied in the term \"free software\" and sought to reframe the discourse to reflect a more commercially minded position. In addition, the ambiguity of the term \"free software\" was seen as discouraging business adoption.\nThe group included Christine Peterson, Todd Anderson, Larry Augustin, Jon Hall, Sam Ockman, Michael Tiemann and Eric S. Raymond. Peterson suggested \"open source\" at a meeting held at Palo Alto, California, in reaction to Netscape's announcement in January 1998 of a source code release for Navigator. Linus Torvalds gave his support the following day, and Phil Hughes backed the term in \"Linux Journal\". Richard Stallman, the founder of the free software movement, initially seemed to adopt the term, but later changed his mind. Netscape released its source code under the Netscape Public License and later under the Mozilla Public License.\n\nRaymond was especially active in the effort to popularize the new term. He made the first public call to the free software community to adopt it in February 1998. Shortly after, he founded The Open Source Initiative in collaboration with Bruce Perens.\n\nThe term gained further visibility through an event organized in April 1998 by technology publisher Tim O'Reilly. Originally titled the \"Freeware Summit\" and later known as the \"Open Source Summit\", the event was attended by the leaders of many of the most important free and open-source projects, including Linus Torvalds, Larry Wall, Brian Behlendorf, Eric Allman, Guido van Rossum, Michael Tiemann, Paul Vixie, Jamie Zawinski, and Eric Raymond. At that meeting, alternatives to the term \"free software\" were discussed. Tiemann argued for \"sourceware\" as a new term, while Raymond argued for \"open source\". The assembled developers took a vote, and the winner was announced at a press conference the same evening.\n\n\"Open source\" has never managed to entirely supersede the older term \"free software\", giving rise to the combined term free and open-source software (FOSS).\n\nSome economists agree that open-source is an information good or \"knowledge good\" with original work involving a significant amount of time, money, and effort. The cost of reproducing the work is low enough that additional users may be added at zero or near zero costthis is referred to as the marginal cost of a product. Copyright creates a monopoly so the price charged to consumers can be significantly higher than the marginal cost of production. This allows the author to recoup the cost of making the original work. Copyright thus creates access costs for consumers who value the work more than the marginal cost but less than the initial production cost. Access costs also pose problems for authors who wish to create a derivative work—such as a copy of a software program modified to fix a bug or add a feature, or a remix of a song—but are unable or unwilling to pay the copyright holder for the right to do so.\n\nBeing organized as effectively a \"consumers' cooperative\", open source eliminates some of the access costs of consumers and creators of derivative works by reducing the restrictions of copyright. Basic economic theory predicts that lower costs would lead to higher consumption and also more frequent creation of derivative works. Organizations such as Creative Commons host websites where individuals can file for alternative \"licenses\", or levels of restriction, for their works.\nThese self-made protections free the general society of the costs of policing copyright infringement.\n\nOthers argue that since consumers do not pay for their copies, creators are unable to recoup the initial cost of production and thus have little economic incentive to create in the first place. By this argument, consumers would lose out because some of the goods they would otherwise purchase would not be available. In practice, content producers can choose whether to adopt a proprietary license and charge for copies, or an open license. Some goods which require large amounts of professional research and development, such as the pharmaceutical industry (which depends largely on patents, not copyright for intellectual property protection) are almost exclusively proprietary, although increasingly sophisticated technologies are being developed on open-source principles.\n\nThere is evidence that open-source development creates enormous value. For example, in the context of open-source hardware design, digital designs are shared for free and anyone with access to digital manufacturing technologies (e.g. RepRap 3D printers) can replicate the product for the cost of materials. The original sharer may receive feedback and potentially improvements on the original design from the peer production community.\n\nAlternative arrangements have also been shown to result in good creation outside of the proprietary license model. Examples include:\n\n\nSocial and political views have been affected by the growth of the concept of open source. Advocates in one field often support the expansion of open source in other fields. But Eric Raymond and other founders of the open-source movement have sometimes publicly argued against speculation about applications outside software, saying that strong arguments for software openness should not be weakened by overreaching into areas where the story may be less compelling. The broader impact of the open-source movement, and the extent of its role in the development of new information sharing procedures, remain to be seen.\n\nThe open-source movement has inspired increased transparency and liberty in biotechnology research, for example by open therapeutics and CAMBIA Even the research methodologies themselves can benefit from the application of open-source principles. It has also given rise to the rapidly-expanding open-source hardware movement.\n\nOpen-source software is software which source code is published and made available to the public, enabling anyone to copy, modify and redistribute the source code without paying royalties or fees.\nOpen-source code can evolve through community cooperation. These communities are composed of individual programmers as well as large companies. Some of the individual programmers who start an open-source project may end up establishing companies offering products or services incorporating open-source programs. Examples of open-source software products are:\n\nOpen-source hardware is hardware which initial specification, usually in a software format, is published and made available to the public, enabling anyone to copy, modify and redistribute the hardware and source code without paying royalties or fees. Open-source hardware evolves through community cooperation. These communities are composed of individual hardware/software developers, hobbyists, as well as very large companies. Examples of open-source hardware initiatives are:\n\nSome publishers of open-access journals have argued that data from food science and gastronomy studies should be freely available to aid reproducibility. A number of people have published creative commons licensed recipe books.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn open-source robot is a robot whose blueprints, schematics, or source code are released under an open-source model.\n\n\n\n\nThe rise of open-source culture in the 20th century resulted from a growing tension between creative practices that involve require access to content that is often copyrighted, and restrictive intellectual property laws and policies governing access to copyrighted content. The two main ways in which intellectual property laws became more restrictive in the 20th century were extensions to the term of copyright (particularly in the United States) and penalties, such as those articulated in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), placed on attempts to circumvent anti-piracy technologies.\n\nAlthough artistic appropriation is often permitted under fair-use doctrines, the complexity and ambiguity of these doctrines creates an atmosphere of uncertainty among cultural practitioners. Also, the protective actions of copyright owners create what some call a \"chilling effect\" among cultural practitioners.\n\nThe idea of an \"open-source\" culture runs parallel to \"Free Culture,\" but is substantively different. \"Free culture\" is a term derived from the free software movement, and in contrast to that vision of culture, proponents of open-source culture (OSC) maintain that some intellectual property law needs to exist to protect cultural producers. Yet they propose a more nuanced position than corporations have traditionally sought. Instead of seeing intellectual property law as an expression of instrumental rules intended to uphold either natural rights or desirable outcomes, an argument for OSC takes into account diverse goods (as in \"the Good life\") and ends.\n\nSites such as ccMixter offer up free web space for anyone willing to license their work under a Creative Commons license. The resulting cultural product is then available to download free (generally accessible) to anyone with an Internet connection. Older analog technologies such as the telephone or television have limitations on the kind of interaction users can have.\n\nThrough various technologies such as peer-to-peer networks and blogs, cultural producers can take advantage of vast social networks to distribute their products. As opposed to traditional media distribution, redistributing digital media on the Internet can be virtually costless. Technologies such as BitTorrent and Gnutella take advantage of various characteristics of the Internet protocol (TCP/IP) in an attempt to totally decentralize file distribution.\n\n\nOpen-source ethics is split into two strands:\n\nIrish philosopher Richard Kearney has used the term \"open-source Hinduism\" to refer to the way historical figures such as Mohandas Gandhi and Swami Vivekananda worked upon this ancient tradition.\n\nOpen-source journalism formerly referred to the standard journalistic techniques of news gathering and fact checking, reflecting \"open-source intelligence\", a similar term used in military intelligence circles. Now, \"open-source journalism\" commonly refers to forms of innovative publishing of online journalism, rather than the sourcing of news stories by a professional journalist. In the 25 December 2006 issue of TIME magazine this is referred to as user created content and listed alongside more traditional open-source projects such as OpenSolaris and Linux.\n\nWeblogs, or blogs, are another significant platform for open-source culture. Blogs consist of periodic, reverse chronologically ordered posts, using a technology that makes webpages easily updatable with no understanding of design, code, or file transfer required. While corporations, political campaigns and other formal institutions have begun using these tools to distribute information, many blogs are used by individuals for personal expression, political organizing, and socializing. Some, such as LiveJournal or WordPress, utilize open-source software that is open to the public and can be modified by users to fit their own tastes. Whether the code is open or not, this format represents a nimble tool for people to borrow and re-present culture; whereas traditional websites made the illegal reproduction of culture difficult to regulate, the mutability of blogs makes \"open sourcing\" even more uncontrollable since it allows a larger portion of the population to replicate material more quickly in the public sphere.\n\nMessageboards are another platform for open-source culture. Messageboards (also known as discussion boards or forums), are places online where people with similar interests can congregate and post messages for the community to read and respond to. Messageboards sometimes have moderators who enforce community standards of etiquette such as banning users who are spammers. Other common board features are private messages (where users can send messages to one another) as well as chat (a way to have a real time conversation online) and image uploading. Some messageboards use phpBB, which is a free open-source package. Where blogs are more about individual expression and tend to revolve around their authors, messageboards are about creating a conversation amongst its users where information can be shared freely and quickly. Messageboards are a way to remove intermediaries from everyday life—for instance, instead of relying on commercials and other forms of advertising, one can ask other users for frank reviews of a product, movie or CD. By removing the cultural middlemen, messageboards help speed the flow of information and exchange of ideas.\n\nOpenDocument is an open document file format for saving and exchanging editable office documents such as text documents (including memos, reports, and books), spreadsheets, charts, and presentations. Organizations and individuals that store their data in an open format such as OpenDocument avoid being locked into a single software vendor, leaving them free to switch software if their current vendor goes out of business, raises their prices, changes their software, or changes their licensing terms to something less favorable.\n\nOpen-source movie production is either an open call system in which a changing crew and cast collaborate in movie production, a system in which the end result is made available for re-use by others or in which exclusively open-source products are used in the production. The 2006 movie Elephants Dream is said to be the \"world's first open movie\", created entirely using open-source technology.\n\nAn open-source documentary film has a production process allowing the open contributions of archival material footage, and other filmic elements, both in unedited and edited form, similar to crowdsourcing. By doing so, on-line contributors become part of the process of creating the film, helping to influence the editorial and visual material to be used in the documentary, as well as its thematic development. The first open-source documentary film is the non-profit \"The American Revolution\", which went into development in 2006, and will examine the role media played in the cultural, social and political changes from 1968 to 1974 through the story of radio station WBCN-FM in Boston. The film is being produced by Lichtenstein Creative Media and the non-profit Filmmakers Collaborative. Open Source Cinema is a website to create Basement Tapes, a feature documentary about copyright in the digital age, co-produced by the National Film Board of Canada.\nOpen-source film-making refers to a form of film-making that takes a method of idea formation from open-source software, but in this case the 'source' for a filmmaker is raw unedited footage rather than programming code. It can also refer to a method of film-making where the process of creation is 'open' i.e. a disparate group of contributors, at different times contribute to the final piece.\n\nOpen-IPTV is IPTV that is not limited to one recording studio, production studio, or cast. Open-IPTV uses the Internet or other means to pool efforts and resources together to create an online community that all contributes to a show.\n\nWithin the academic community, there is discussion about expanding what could be called the \"intellectual commons\" (analogous to the Creative Commons). Proponents of this view have hailed the Connexions Project at Rice University, OpenCourseWare project at MIT, Eugene Thacker's article on \"open-source DNA\", the \"Open Source Cultural Database\", Salman Khan's Khan Academy and Wikipedia as examples of applying open source outside the realm of computer software.\n\nOpen-source curricula are instructional resources whose digital source can be freely used, distributed and modified.\n\nAnother strand to the academic community is in the area of research. Many funded research projects produce software as part of their work. There is an increasing interest in making the outputs of such projects available under an open-source license. In the UK the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) has developed a policy on open-source software. JISC also funds a development service called OSS Watch which acts as an advisory service for higher and further education institutions wishing to use, contribute to and develop open-source software.\n\nOn 30 March 2010, President Barack Obama signed the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which included $2 billion over four years to fund the TAACCCT program, which is described as \"the largest OER (open education resources) initiative in the world and uniquely focused on creating curricula in partnership with industry for credentials in vocational industry sectors like manufacturing, health, energy, transportation, and IT\".\n\nThe principle of sharing pre-dates the open-source movement; for example, the free sharing of information has been institutionalized in the scientific enterprise since at least the 19th century. Open-source principles have always been part of the scientific community. The sociologist Robert K. Merton described the four basic elements of the community—universal ism (an international perspective), communal ism (sharing information), disinterestedness (removing one's personal views from the scientific inquiry) and organized skepticism (requirements of proof and review) that accurately describe the scientific community today.\n\nThese principles are, in part, complemented by US law's focus on protecting expression and method but not the ideas themselves. There is also a tradition of publishing research results to the scientific community instead of keeping all such knowledge proprietary. One of the recent initiatives in scientific publishing has been open access—the idea that research should be published in such a way that it is free and available to the public. There are currently many open access journals where the information is available free online, however most journals do charge a fee (either to users or libraries for access). The Budapest Open Access Initiative is an international effort with the goal of making all research articles available free on the Internet.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health has recently proposed a policy on \"Enhanced Public Access to NIH Research Information\". This policy would provide a free, searchable resource of NIH-funded results to the public and with other international repositories six months after its initial publication. The NIH's move is an important one because there is significant amount of public funding in scientific research. Many of the questions have yet to be answered—the balancing of profit vs. public access, and ensuring that desirable standards and incentives do not diminish with a shift to open access.\n\nFarmavita.Net is a community of pharmaceuticals executives that has recently proposed a new business model of open-source pharmaceuticals. The project is targeted to development and sharing of know-how for manufacture of essential and life-saving medicines. It is mainly dedicated to the countries with less developed economies where local pharmaceutical research and development resources are insufficient for national needs. It will be limited to generic (off-patent) medicines with established use. By definition, a medicinal product has a \"well-established use\" if is used for at least 15 years, with recognized efficacy and an acceptable level of safety. In that event, the expensive clinical test and trial results could be replaced by appropriate scientific literature.\n\nBenjamin Franklin was an early contributor eventually donating all his inventions including the Franklin stove, bifocals, and the lightning rod to the public domain.\n\nNew NGO communities are starting to use the open-source technology as a tool. One example is the Open Source Youth Network started in 2007 in Lisboa by ISCA members.\n\nOpen innovation is also a new emerging concept which advocate putting R&D in a common pool. The Eclipse platform is openly presenting itself as an Open innovation network.\n\nCopyright protection is used in the performing arts and even in athletic activities. Some groups have attempted to remove copyright from such practices.\n\nIn 2012, Russian music composer, scientist and Russian Pirate Party member Victor Argonov presented detailed raw files of his electronic opera \"2032\" under free license CC-BY-NC 3.0. This opera was originally composed and published in 2007 by Russian label MC Entertainment as a commercial product, but then the author changed its status to free. In his blog he said that he decided to open raw files (including wav, midi and other used formats) to the public in order to support worldwide pirate actions against SOPA and PIPA. Several Internet resources, called \"2032\" the first open-source musical opera in history.\n\nThe following are events and applications that have been developed via the open source community, and echo the ideologies of the open source movement.\n\nOpen Education Consortium — an organization composed of various colleges that support open source and share some of their material online. This organization, headed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was established to aid in the exchange of open source educational materials.\n\nWikipedia — user-generated online encyclopedia with sister projects in academic areas, such as Wikiversity — a community dedicated to the creation and exchange of learning materials\n\nProject Gutenberg — prior to the existence of Google Scholar Beta, this was the first supplier of electronic books and the very first free library project\n\nSynthetic Biology- This new technology is potentially important because it promises to enable cheap, lifesaving new drugs as well as helping to yield biofuels that may help to solve our energy problem. Although synthetic biology has not yet come out of its \"lab\" stage, it has potential to become industrialized in the near future. In order to industrialize open source science, there are some scientists who are trying to build their own brand of it.\n\nThe open-access movement is a movement that is similar in ideology to the open source movement. Members of this movement maintain that academic material should be readily available to provide help with “future research, assist in teaching and aid in academic purposes.” The Open access movement aims to eliminate subscription fees and licensing restrictions of academic materials\n\nThe free-culture movement is a movement that seeks to achieve a culture that engages in collective freedom via freedom of expression, free public access to knowledge and information, full demonstration of creativity and innovation in various arenas and promotion of citizen liberties.\n\nCreative Commons is an organization that “develops, supports, and stewards legal and technical infrastructure that maximizes digital creativity, sharing, and innovation.” It encourages the use of protected properties online for research, education, and creative purposes in pursuit of a universal access. Creative Commons provides an infrastructure through a set of copyright licenses and tools that creates a better balance within the realm of “all rights reserved” properties. The Creative Commons license offers a slightly more lenient alternative to “all rights reserved” copyrights for those who do not wish to exclude the use of their material.\n\nThe Zeitgeist Movement is an international social movement that advocates a transition into a sustainable \"resource-based economy\" based on collaboration in which monetary incentives are replaced by commons-based ones with everyone having access to everything (from code to products) as in \"open source everything\". While its activism and events are typically focused on media and education, TZM is a major supporter of open source projects worldwide since they allow for uninhibited advancement of science and technology, independent of constraints posed by institutions of patenting and capitalist investment.\n\nP2P Foundation is an “international organization focused on studying, researching, documenting and promoting peer to peer practices in a very broad sense”. Its objectives incorporate those of the open source movement, whose principles are integrated in a larger socio-economic model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "888372", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=888372", "title": "Provisions of Oxford", "text": "Provisions of Oxford\n\nThe Provisions of Oxford were constitutional reforms developed in 1258 to resolve a dispute between the English barons and King Henry III. They asserted the right of the barons to representation in the king's government and, like the earlier Magna Carta, demonstrated the ability of the barons to press their concerns in opposition to the monarchy.\n\nWhen in the spring of 1258 King Henry III of England sought financial aid from a new Parliament, he was confronted by a group of barons who insisted on a new commission of reform, in the shape of a council of twenty-four members, twelve selected by the crown, twelve by the barons. The Provisions of Oxford were the reform programme the twenty-four, including Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, set out.\n\nThe Provisions set up a new form of government, with a 15-member Privy Council (nine baronial) to advise the king and oversee the entire administration as a standing body. They also confirmed that \"there be three parliaments a year...to treat of the common wants of the kingdom, and of the king.\" At the parliaments, the Fifteen would be checked and monitored by another body of twelve representative barons. Meanwhile the men selected (by four electors appointed by the Twenty-four) were to supervise ministerial appointments, local administration and the custody of royal castles; while recommendations for an inquest into local (mis-)government, and further measures of reform were also set out.\n\nA written confirmation of the agreement was sent to the sheriffs of all the counties of England trilingually, in Latin, French and, significantly, in Middle English. The use of the English language was symbolic of the \"Anglicisation\" of the government of England and an antidote to the Francization which had taken place in the decades immediately before. The Provisions were the first government documents to be published in English since the Norman Conquest two hundred years before.\n\nThe Provisions of Oxford were confirmed and extended in 1259 by the Provisions of Westminster. The administrative controls of the Provisions of Oxford were overthrown by Henry, helped by a papal bull, in 1261, seeding the start of the Second Barons' War (1263–1267), which was won by the King and his royalist supporters; and they were annulled for the last time in 1266 by the Dictum of Kenilworth. However the administrative and legislative reforms the barons had initiated were taken up and confirmed in the Statute of Marlborough. \n\nThe 1258 Provisions had a significant effect upon the development of the English Common Law, limiting in part the expansion of royal jurisdiction by way of the number of available writs, but in the main confirming the importance of the common law of the land for all, from king to commoner. \n\n\n"}

The measure passed with a yes vote of 123,033 to a no vote of 89,856. The proposition was later struck down in court.\n\nProposition H sought to restrict handgun possession among San Francisco residents within city limits to police and certain security professionals, and to ban the manufacture, distribution, sale and transfer of firearms and ammunition within the city. Limited exceptions to the proposition would have allowed residents to possess handguns only if required for specific professional purposes. For example, San Francisco residents who are security guards, peace officers, or active members of the U.S. armed forces would be permitted to possess handguns while on duty. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors enacted penalties for violation of this ordinance, including mandatory jail time. Until April 1, 2006, residents would have been able to surrender their handguns to any district station of the San Francisco Police Department or the San Francisco Sheriff's Department without penalty (no refund of buying cost was planned).\n\nThe measure was placed on the ballot with supporting signatures from Supervisors Tom Ammiano, Chris Daly, Bevan Dufty and Matt Gonzalez.\n\nSupervisor Michela Alioto-Pier initially supported the ordinance but formally withdrew her sponsorship on February 23, 2005.\n\n\nThe City population of San Francisco is at least 805,235, without counting people not registered, or travelling/working in the metro area.\n\nProposition H would have taken effect January 1, 2006, but enforcement was suspended by litigation.\n\nOn June 13, 2006, in the case of Fiscal v.

Judge Warren sided with the National Rifle Association, Second Amendment Foundation, and other petitioners represented by Chuck Michel of Trutanich-Michel, LLP, in Long Beach, California, who sued on behalf of gun owners, advocates and dealers the day after the measure passed. Judge Warren wrote in his 30-page ruling that \"Proposition H is adjudged invalid as preempted by state law.\"\n\nThe judge's decision was not without precedent considering a California appeals court nullified an almost identical San Francisco gun ban on exactly the same grounds in 1982.\n\nThe City appealed Judge Warren's ruling, but lost by a unanimous decision from the three judge panel in the Court of Appeals issued on January 9, 2008.

The state Supreme Court reached a unanimous decision on April 9, 2008 that rejected the city's appeal and upheld the lower courts' decision.\n\nIn October 2008, San Francisco was forced to pay a $380,000 settlement to the National Rifle Association and other plaintiffs to cover the costs of litigating Proposition H.\n\n\n\n<br>\n"}

{"id": "339213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=339213", "title": "Scutage", "text": "Scutage\n\nScutage is a medieval English tax levied on holders of a knight's fee under the feudal land tenure of knight-service. Under feudalism the king, through his vassals, provided land to knights for their support. The knights owed the king military service in return. The knights were allowed to \"buy out\" of the military service by paying scutage. As time passed the king began to impose a scutage on holders knight's fees, even in time of peace.\n\nThe institution existed under Henry I (reigned 1100–1135) and Stephen (reigned 1135–1154), when it occurs as \"scutagium\", \"scuagium\" or \"escuagium\". The creation of fractions of knights' fee probably hastened its introduction: the holders of such fractions could only discharge their obligation \"via\" scutage. The increasing use of mercenaries in the 12th century would also make a money payment of greater use to the crown.\n\nSeparate levies of scutage received the names of the campaigns for which they were raised, as \"the scutage of Toulouse\" (or \"great scutage\"), \"the scutage of Ireland\", and so forth. The levy demanded from each fee one mark (13s. 4d., two thirds of a pound), one pound or two marks, but anything above a pound seemed abnormal till John (reigned 1199–1216) imposed levies of two marks in most years without even the excuse of a war. The irritation caused by these exactions reached a climax in 1214, when John demanded three marks. Taxation through scutage became a prominent cause among the many that led to the rebellion of 1215, which culminated in the proclamation of Magna Carta of 1215. Its provisions prohibited the crown from levying any scutage save by \"the common counsel of our realm\". \n\nThe reissued Charter of 1217 provided, instead of this, that scutage levies should remain at the rate as of the reign of Henry II. In practice, however, under Henry III (reigned 1216–1272), scutage rates usually amounted to three marks, but required the assent of the barons, and levies occurred only on adequate occasions.\n\nMeanwhile, a practice had arisen, possibly as early as Richard I's reign (1189–1199), of accepting from great barons special \"fines\" for permission not to serve in a campaign. This practice appears to have rested on the crown's right to decide whether to exact personal service or to accept scutage \"in lieu\" of service. A system of special composition thus arose which largely replaced the old one of scutage. As between the tenants-in-chief, however, and their under-tenants, the payment of scutage continued. The terms of charters of subinfeudation, which specified the quota of scutage due rather than the proportion of a knight's fee granted, often stereotyped scutage. For the purpose of recouping themselves by levying from their under-tenants, the tenants-in-chief received from the crown writs \"de scutagio habendo\". Under Edward I (reigned 1272–1307) the new system developed so completely that the six levies of the reign, each as high as two pounds on the fee, applied in practice only to the under-tenants, their lords compounding with the crown by the payment of large sums, though their nominal assessment, somewhat mysteriously, became much lower (see Knight service).\n\nScutage rapidly became obsolescent as a source of revenue, Edward II (reigned 1307–1327) and Edward III (reigned 1327–1377) imposing only one levy each and relying on other more uniform and direct modes of taxation. The lengths to which subinfeudation had gone also hastened its rapid decay; increasing subinfeudation led to constant dispute and litigation as to which of the holders in the descending chain of tenure remained liable for the payment. Apart from its financial aspect it had possessed a legal importance as the test, according to Bracton, of tenure by knight-service, its payment, on however small a scale, proving the tenure to be \"military\" with all the consequences involved.\n\nJ. F. Baldwin's \"The Scutage and Knight Service in England\" (1897), a dissertation printed at the University of Chicago Press, offers a major monograph on the subject (though not wholly free from error). Madox's \"History of the Exchequer\" formerly formed the standard authority. J. H. Round in \"Feudal England\" (1895) first set forth a more modern view. In 1896 appeared the \"Red Book of the Exchequer\" (Rolls series), which, with the \"Book of Fees\" (Public Record Office) and the Pipe Rolls (published by the Record Commission and the Pipe Roll Society), provides the chief record authority on the subject; but the editor misdated many of the scutages, and JH Round in his \"Studies on the Red Book of the Exchequer\" (privately issued) and his \"Commune of London and other Studies\" (1899) severely criticized his conclusions. See also Pollock and Maitland's \"History of English Law\" (1895) and McKechnie's \"Magna Carta\" (1905). Scargill Bird's \"Scutage and Marshal’s Rolls\" in \"Genealogist\" (1884), vol. i., has important coverage of later records.\n\n"}

{"id": "4055635", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4055635", "title": "Siblicide", "text": "Siblicide\n\nSiblicide (attributed by behavioural ecologist Doug Mock to Barbara M. Braun) is the killing of an infant individual by its close relatives (full or half siblings). It may occur directly between siblings or be mediated by the parents. The evolutionary drivers may be either indirect benefits for the genetic viability of a population or direct benefits for the perpetrators. Siblicide has mainly, but not only, been observed in birds.\n\nThe word is also used as a unifying term for fratricide and sororicide in the human species; unlike these more specific terms, it leaves the sex of the victim unspecified.\n\nSiblicidal behavior can be either obligate or facultative. Obligate siblicide is when a sibling almost always ends up being killed. Facultative siblicide means that siblicide may or may not occur, based on environmental conditions. In birds, obligate siblicidal behavior results in the older chick killing the other chick(s). In facultative siblicidal animals, fighting is frequent, but does not always lead to death of a sibling; this type of behavior often exists in patterns for different species. For instance, in the blue-footed booby, a sibling may be hit by a nest mate only once a day for a couple of weeks and then attacked at random, leading to its death. More birds are facultatively siblicidal than obligatory siblicidal. This is perhaps because siblicide takes a great amount of energy and is not always advantageous.\n\nSiblicide generally only occurs when resources, specifically food sources, are scarce. Siblicide is advantageous for the surviving offspring because they have now eliminated most or all of their competition. It is also somewhat advantageous for the parents because the surviving offspring most likely have the strongest genes, and so, will pass these genes onto their offspring later in life, creating a strong line of genetics.\n\nSome parents encourage siblicide, while others prevent it. If resources are scarce, the parents may encourage siblicide because only some offspring will survive anyway, so they want the strongest offspring to survive. By letting the offspring kill each other, it saves the parents time and energy that would be wasted on feeding offspring that most likely would not survive anyway.\n\nParent–offspring conflict is a theory which states that offspring can take actions to advance their own fitness while decreasing the fitness of their parents and that parents can increase their own fitness while simultaneously decreasing the fitness of their offspring. This is one of the driving forces of siblicide because it increases the fitness of the offspring by decreasing the amount of competition they have. Parents may either discourage or accept siblicide depending on whether it increases the probability of their offspring surviving to reproduce.\n\nInclusive fitness is defined as an animal's individual reproductive success, plus the positive and/or negative effects that animal has on its sibling's reproductive success, multiplied by the animal's degree of kinship. In instances of siblicide, the victim is usually the youngest sibling. This sibling's reproductive value can be measured by how much it enhances or detracts from the success of other siblings, therefore this individual is considered to be marginal. The marginal sibling can act as an additional element of parental success if it, as well as its siblings, survive. If an older sibling happens to die unexpectedly, the marginal sibling is there to take its place; this acts as insurance against the death of another sibling, which depends on the likelihood of the older sibling dying.\n\nThe cost and effect siblicide has on a brood's reproductive success can be broken down into an algebraic equation. formula_1 is the level of parental investment in the entire brood, with an absolute maximum value MH(0 ≤M ≤M\"H).\" A parent investing formula_1 units of parental investment (PI) in its current brood can expect a future reproductive success formula_3 given by\n\nformula_4 if M ≤ 0\n\nf(M)= { fH[1-(M/MH)^θ ] if formula_5\n\nif MH≤M,\n\nformula_4 is the parents' future reproductive success, if it makes no reproductive attempt. The parameter ᶿ determines the relationship between parental investment and the cost of reproduction. The equation indicates that as formula_1 increases, the future reproductive success of the parent decreases.\n\nThe probability p(m) that a chick joins the breeding population after receiving M units of PI is\n\nformula_8 if formula_9\n\nif m ≤ mv\n\nCattle egrets, \"Bubulcus ibis\", exhibit asynchronous hatching and androgen loading in the first two eggs of their normal three-egg clutch. This results in older chicks being more aggressive and having a developmental head start. If food is scarce the third chick often dies or is killed by the larger siblings and so parental effort is distributed between the remaining chicks, which are hence more likely to survive to reproduce. The extra \"excess\" egg is possibly laid either due to exploit the possibility of elevated food abundance (as seen in the blue-footed booby, \"Sula nebouxii\") or due to the chance of sterility in one egg. This is suggested by studies into the common grackle, \"Quiscalus quiscula\" and the masked booby, \"Sula dactylatra\".\n\nThe theory of kin selection may be seen as a genetically mediated altruistic response within closely related individuals whereby the fitness conferred by the altruist to the recipient outweighs the cost to itself or the sibling/parent group. The fact that such a sacrifice occurs indicates an evolutionary tendency in some taxa toward improved vertical gene transmission in families or a higher percentage of the unit in reaching a reproductive age in a resource-limited environment.\n\nThe closely related masked and Nazca boobies are both obligately siblicidal species, while the blue-footed booby is a facultatively siblicidal species. In a facultatively siblicidal species, aggression occurs between siblings but is not always lethal, whereas in an obligately siblicidal species, aggression between siblings always leads to the death of one of the offspring. All three species have an average brood size of two eggs, which are laid within approximately four days of each other. In the few days before the second egg hatches, the first-born chick, known as the senior chick or A-chick, enjoys a period of growth and development during which it has full access to resources provided by the parent bird. Therefore, when the junior chick (B-chick) hatches, there is a significant disparity in size and strength between it and its older sibling.\n\nIn these three booby species, hatching order indicates chick hierarchy in the nest. The A-chick is dominant to the B-chick, which in turn is dominant to the C chick, etc. (when there are more than two chicks per brood) Masked booby and Nazca booby dominant A-chicks always begin pecking their younger sibling(s) as soon as they hatch; moreover, assuming it is healthy, the A-chick usually pecks its younger sibling to death or pushes it out of the nest scrape within the first two days that the junior chick is alive. Blue-footed booby A-chicks also express their dominance by pecking their younger sibling. However, unlike the obligately siblicidal masked and Nazca booby chicks, their behavior is not always lethal. A study by Lougheed and Anderson (1999) reveals that blue-footed booby senior chicks only kill their siblings in times of food shortage. Furthermore, even when junior chicks are killed, it does not happen immediately. According to Anderson, the average age of death of the junior chick in a masked booby brood is 1.8 days, while the average age of death of the junior chick in a blue-footed booby brood may be as high as 18 days. The difference in age of death in the junior chick in each booby species is indicative of the type of siblicide that the species practices. Facultatively siblicidal blue-footed booby A-chicks only kill their nest mate(s) when necessary. Obligately siblicidal masked and Nazca booby A-chicks kill their sibling no matter if resources are plentiful or not; in other words, siblicidal behavior occurs independently of environmental factors.\n\nBlue-footed boobies are less likely to commit siblicide and if they do, they commit it later after hatching than masked boobies. In a study, the chicks of blue-footed and masked boobies were switched to see if the rates of siblicide would be affected by the foster parents. It turns out that the masked boobies that were placed under the care of blue-footed booby parents committed siblicide less often than they would normally. Similarly, the blue-footed booby chicks placed with the masked booby parents committed siblicide more often than they normally did, indicating that parental intervention also affects the offspring's behavior.\n\nIn another experiment which tested the effect of a synchronous brood on siblicide, three groups were created: one in which all the eggs were synchronous, one in which the eggs hatched asynchronously, and one in which asynchronous hatching was exaggerated. It was found that the synchronous brood fought more, was less likely to survive than the control group, and resulted in lower parental efficiency. The exaggerated asynchronous brood also had a lower survivorship rate than the control brood and forced parents to bring more food to the nest each day, even though not as many offspring survived.\n\nOriginally proposed by Dorward (1962), the insurance egg hypothesis (IEH) has quickly become the most widely supported explanation for avian siblicide as well as the overproduction of eggs in siblicidal birds. The IEH states that the extra egg(s) produced by the parent serves as an \"insurance policy\" in the case of the failure of the first egg (either it did not hatch or the chick died soon after hatching). When both eggs hatch successfully, the second chick, or B-chick, is known as the marginal offspring; otherwise stated, it is marginal in the sense that it can add to or subtract from the evolutionary success of its family members. It can increase reproductive and evolutionary success in two primary ways. Firstly, it represents an extra unit of parental success if it survives along with its siblings. In the context of Hamilton's inclusive fitness theory, the marginal chick increases the total number of offspring successfully produced by the parent and therefore adds to the gene pool that the parent bird passes to the next generation. Secondly, it can serve as a replacement for any of its siblings that do not hatch or die prematurely.\n\nSiblicide (brood reduction) in spotted hyenas (\"Crocuta crocuta\") resulted in the champions achieving a long-term growth rate similar to that of singletons and thus significantly increased their expected survival. The incidence of siblicide increased as the average cohort growth rate declined. When both cubs were alive, total maternal input in siblicidal litters was significantly lower than in non-siblicidal litters. Once siblicide has occurred, the growth rates of siblicide survivors substantially increased, indicating that mothers don't reduce their maternal input after siblicide has occurred. Also, facultative siblicide can evolve when the fitness benefits gained after the removal of a sibling by the dominant offspring, exceeds the costs acquired in terms of decreasing that sibling's inclusive fitness from the death of its sibling.\n\nSome mammals sometimes commit siblicide for the purpose of gaining a larger portion of the parent's care. In spotted hyenas, pups of the same sex exhibit siblicide more often than male-female twins. Sex ratios may be manipulated in this way and the dominant status of a female and transmission of genes may be ensured through a son or daughter which inherits this solely, receiving much more parental nursing and decreased sexual competition.\n\nSiblicidal \"survival of the fittest\" is also exhibited in parasitic wasps, which lay multiple eggs in a host, after which the strongest larva kills its rival sibling. Another example is when mourning cloak larvae will eat non-hatched eggs.\n\nSiblicide can also be seen in humans in the form of twins in the mother's womb. One twin may grow to be an average weight, while the other is underweight. This is a result of one twin taking more nutrients from the mother than the other twin. In cases of identical twins, they may even have Twin to Twin Transfusion Syndrome (TTTS). This means that the twins share the same placenta and blood and nutrients can then move between twins. The twins may also be suffering from Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR), meaning that there is not enough room for both of the twins to grow. All of these factors can limit the growth of one of the twins while promoting the growth of the other. While one of the twins may not die because of these factors, it is entirely possible that their health will be compromised and lead to complications after their birth.\n\nSiblicide in humans can also manifest itself in the form of murder. There was a significantly greater proportion of accidental deaths in half-siblings, stepsiblings, and sibling in-laws than in full siblings. This type of killing (siblicide) is rarer than other types of killings. Genetic relatedness may be an important moderator of conflict and homicide among family members, including siblings. Siblings may be less likely to kill a full sibling because that would be a decrease in their own fitness. The cost of killing a sibling is much higher than the fitness costs associated with the death of a sibling-in-law because the killer wouldn't be losing 50% of their genes. Siblicide was found to be more common in early to middle adulthood as opposed to adolescence. Yet, there is still a tendency for the killer to be the younger party when the victim and killer were of the same sex. The older individual was most likely to be the killer if the incident were to occur at a younger age.\n\n\n\n"}

For these purposes, Ross (2000b) defines a \"state\" as the elected and appointed officials, the bureaucracy, and the institutions, bodies and organisations comprising the apparatus of the government. Initially, the state was the agency of deterrence, using the threat of punishment as a utilitarian tool to shape the behaviour of its citizens. Then, it became the mediator, interpreting society's wishes for conflict resolution. Theorists then identified the state as the \"victim\" in victimless crimes. Now, theorists are examining the role of the state as one of the possible perpetrators of crime (Ross, 2000b) whether directly or in the context of state-corporate crime.\n\nGreen & Ward (2004) adopt Max Weber's thesis of a sovereign “state” as claiming a monopoly on the legitimate use of force. Thus, the criteria for determining whether a state is \"deviant\" will draw on international norms and standards of behaviour for achieving the state’s usual operating goals. One of those standards will be whether the state respects human rights in the exercise of its powers. But, one of the definitional difficulties is that the states themselves define what is criminal within their own territories, and as sovereign powers, they are not accountable to the international community unless they submit to international jurisdiction generally, or criminal jurisdiction in particular.\n\nAs international crimes, a state may engage in state terror and terrorism, torture, war crimes, and genocide. Both internationally and nationally, there may be corruption, state-corporate crime, and organized crime. Within its territorial borders, some crimes are either the result of situations where the state is not the direct criminal actor, e.g. arising from natural disasters or through the agency of bodies such as the police. More usually, the state is directly involved in excessive secrecy and cover-ups, disinformation, and unaccountability (including tax evasion by officials) which often reflect upper-class and nonpluralistic interests, and infringe human rights (Ross, 2000a). One of the key issues is the extent to which, if at all, state crime can be controlled. Often state crimes are revealed by an investigative news agency resulting in scandals but, even among first world democratic states, it is difficult to maintain genuinely independent control over the criminal enforcement mechanisms and few senior officers of the state are held personally accountable. When the citizens of second and third world countries which may be of a more authoritarian nature, seek to hold their leaders accountable, the problems become more acute. Public opinion, media attention, and public protests, whether violent or nonviolent, may all be criminalised as political crimes and suppressed, while critical international comments are of little real value. \n\nBarak (1991) examines recent history through Reaganism and Thatcherism which led to a decline in the provision of social services and an increase in public security functions. In turn, this created the opportunity for injustices and state crimes involving the suppression of democratic functions within the state. As Johns and Johnson (1994) note, \"The concern of the U.S. policy elites is not, therefore, with the establishment or protection of democracy; it is with the establishment of capitalism world-wide and with the unimpeded control of resources and markets\" (p7) \"Panama is an especially good example of how the rollback strategy involves subverting or overthrowing not only governments that are socialist or left-wing but the governments of countries that seek full independence from the economic, political, or military influence of the United States\" (pp9/10) But, in terms of accountability, they argue that the coverage of the invasion demonstrated \"just how subservient the corporate media had become to the political elite in the United States\" (p63) Hence, even in democratic countries, it can be difficult to hold political leaders accountable, whether politically or legally, because access to reliable factual information can be limited.\n\nWithin the context of state-corporate crime, Green and Ward (2004) examine how the debt repayment schemes in developing countries place such a financial burden on states that they often collude with corporations offering prospects of capital growth. Such collusion frequently entails the softening of environmental and other regulations. The debt service obligation can also exacerbate political instability in countries where the legitimacy of state power is questioned. Such political volatility leads states to adopt clientelistic or patrimonialist patterns of governance, fostering organized crime, corruption, and authoritarianism. In some third world countries, this political atmosphere has encouraged repression and the use of torture. Exceptionally, genocide has occurred. \n"}

{"id": "3178199", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3178199", "title": "Tethering", "text": "Tethering\n\nTethering, or phone-as-modem (PAM), is the sharing of a mobile device's Internet connection with other connected computers. Connection of a mobile device with other devices can be done over wireless LAN (Wi-Fi), over Bluetooth or by physical connection using a cable, for example through USB.\n\nIf tethering is done over WLAN, the feature may be branded as a personal or mobile hotspot, which allows the device to serve as a portable router. Mobile hotspots may be protected by a PIN or password. The Internet-connected mobile device can act as a portable wireless access point and router for devices connected to it.\n\nMany mobile devices are equipped with software to offer tethered Internet access. Windows Mobile 6.5, Windows Phone 7, Android (starting from version 2.2), and iOS 3.0 (or later) offer tethering over a Bluetooth PAN or a USB connection. Tethering over Wi-Fi, also known as Personal Hotspot, is available on iOS starting with iOS 4.2.5 (or later) on iPhone 4, 4S (2010), 5, iPad (3rd generation), certain Windows Mobile 6.5 devices like the HTC HD2, Windows Phone 7, 8 and 8.1 devices (varies by manufacturer and model), and certain Android phones (varies widely depending on carrier, manufacturer, and software version).\n\nFor IPv4 networks, the tethering normally works via NAT on the handset's existing data connection, so from the network point of view, there is just one device with a single IPv4 network address, though it is technically possible to attempt to identify multiple machines.\n\nOn some mobile network operators, this feature is contractually unavailable by default, and may only be activated by paying to add a tethering package to a data plan or choosing a data plan that includes tethering, such as Lycamobile MVNO. This is done primarily because with a computer sharing the network connection, there may well be a substantial increase in the customer's mobile data use, for which the network may not have budgeted in their network design and pricing structures.\n\nSome network-provided devices have carrier-specific software that may deny the inbuilt tethering ability normally available on the device, or only enable it if the subscriber pays an additional fee. Some operators have asked Google or any mobile device producer using Android to completely remove tethering support from the operating system on certain devices. Handsets purchased SIM-free, without a network provider subsidy, are often unhindered with regards to tethering.\n\nThere are, however, several ways to enable tethering on restricted devices without paying the carrier for it, including 3rd party USB Tethering apps such as PDAnet, rooting Android devices or jailbreaking iOS devices and installing a tethering application on the device. Tethering is also available as a downloadable third-party application on most Symbian mobile phones as well as on the MeeGo platform and on WebOS mobiles phones.\n\nDepending on the wireless carrier, a user's cellular device may have restricted functionality. While tethering may be allowed at no extra cost, some carriers impose a one-time charge to enable tethering and others forbid tethering or impose added data charges. Contracts that advertise \"unlimited\" data usage often have limits detailed in a Fair usage policy.\n\nIn the UK, two tethering-permitted mobile plans offered unlimited data: \"The Full Monty\" on T-Mobile, and \"The One Plan\" on Three. Three offered tethering as a standard feature until early 2012, retaining it on selected plans. T-Mobile dropped tethering on its unlimited data plans in late 2012.\n\nAs cited in Sprint Nextel's \"Terms of Service\":\nExcept with Phone-as-Modem plans, you may not use a mobile device (including a Bluetooth device) as a modem in connection with any computer. We reserve the right to deny or terminate service without notice for any misuse or any use that adversely affects network performance.\nT-Mobile USA has a similar clause in its \"Terms & Conditions\": \n\nUnless explicitly permitted by your Data Plan, other uses, including for example, using your Device as a modem or tethering your Device to a personal computer or other hardware, are not permitted.\nT-Mobile's Simple Family or Simple Business plans offer \"Hotspot\" from devices that offer that function (such as Apple iPhone) to up to 5 devices. Since 2014-03-27, 1000 MB/month is free in the USA with cellular service. The host device has unlimited slow internet for the rest of the month, and all month while roaming in 100 countries, but with no tethering. For $10 or $20/month more per host device, the amount of data available for tethering can be increased markedly. The host device cellular services can be canceled, added, or changed at any time, pro-rated, data tethering levels can be changed month-to-month, and T-Mobile no longer requires any long-term service contracts, allowing users to bring their own devices or buy devices from them, independent of whether they continue service with them.\n\nThe announcement also stated that \"(Verizon) recently revised its service offerings such that consumers on usage-based pricing plans may tether, using any application, without paying an additional fee.\" After that judgement Verizon release \"Share Everything\" plans that enable tethering, however users must drop old plans they were grandfathered under (such as the Unlimited Data plans) and switch, or pay a tethering fee.\n\nIn another instance, Judge Russell Nadel awarded AT&T customer Matt Spaccarelli US$850 via the Ventura Superior Court, despite the fact that Spaccarelli had violated his terms of service by jailbreaking his iPhone in order to fully utilize his iPhone's hardware. Spaccarelli demonstrated that AT&T had unfairly throttled his data connection. His data shows that AT&T had been throttling his connection after approximately 2GB of data was used. Spaccarelli responded by creating a personal web page in order to provide information that allows others to file a similar lawsuit, commenting :\n\nHopefully with all this concrete data and the courts on our side, AT&T will be forced to change something. Let’s just hope it chooses to go the way of Sprint, not T-Mobile.\n\nWhile T-Mobile did eventually allow tethering, on August 31, 2015 the company announced it will punish users who abuse its unlimited data by violating T-Mobile's rules on tethering (which unlike standard data does carry a 7 GB cap before throttling takes effect) by permanently kicking them off the unlimited plans and making users sign up for tiered data plans. T-Mobile mentioned that it was only a small handful of users who abused the tethering rules by using an Android app that masks T-Mobile's tethering monitoring and uses as much as 2 TB's per month, causing speed issues for most customers who don't abuse the rules.\n\n"}
{"id": "31043", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31043", "title": "Trust law", "text": "Trust law\n\nA trust is a three-party fiduciary relationship in which the first party, the trustor or settlor, transfers (\"settles\") a property (often but not necessarily a sum of money) upon the second party (the trustee) for the benefit of the third party, the beneficiary. \n\nA \"testamentary trust\" is created by a will and arises after the death of the settlor. An \"inter vivos\" trust is created during the settlor's lifetime by a trust instrument. A trust may be revocable or irrevocable; in the United States, a trust is presumed to be irrevocable unless the instrument or will creating it states it is revocable, except in California, Oklahoma and Texas, in which trusts are presumed to be revocable until the instrument or will creating them states they are irrevocable. An irrevocable trust can be \"broken\" (revoked) only by a judicial proceeding.\n\nTrusts and similar relationships have existed since Roman times.\n\nThe trustee is the legal owner of the property in trust, as fiduciary for the beneficiary or beneficiaries who is/are the equitable owner(s) of the trust property. Trustees thus have a fiduciary duty to manage the trust to the benefit of the equitable owners. They must provide a regular accounting of trust income and expenditures. Trustees may be compensated and be reimbursed their expenses. A court of competent jurisdiction can remove a trustee who breaches his/her fiduciary duty. Some breaches of fiduciary duty can be charged and tried as criminal offences in a court of law.\n\nA trustee can be a natural person, a business entity or a public body. A trust in the United States may be subject to federal and state taxation.\n\nA trust is created by a settlor, who transfers title to some or all of his or her property to a trustee, who then holds title to that property in trust for the benefit of the beneficiaries. The trust is governed by the terms under which it was created. In most jurisdictions, this requires a contractual trust agreement or deed. It is possible for a single individual to assume the role of more than one of these parties, and for multiple individuals to share a single role. For example, in a living trust it is common for the grantor to be both a trustee and a lifetime beneficiary while naming other contingent beneficiaries.\n\nTrusts have existed since Roman times and have become one of the most important innovations in property law. Trust law has evolved through court rulings differently in different states, so statements in this article are generalizations; understanding the jurisdiction-specific case law involved is tricky. Some U.S. states are adapting the Uniform Trust Code to codify and harmonize their trust laws, but state-specific variations still remain.\nAn owner placing property into trust turns over part of his or her bundle of rights to the trustee, separating the property's legal ownership and control from its equitable ownership and benefits. This may be done for tax reasons or to control the property and its benefits if the settlor is absent, incapacitated, or deceased. Testamentary trusts may be created in wills, defining how money and property will be handled for children or other beneficiaries.\n\nWhile the trustee is given legal title to the trust property, in accepting the property title, the trustee owes a number of fiduciary duties to the beneficiaries. The primary duties owed include the duty of loyalty, the duty of prudence, the duty of impartiality. A trustee may be held to a very high standard of care in their dealings, in order to enforce their behavior. To ensure beneficiaries receive their due, trustees are subject to a number of ancillary duties in support of the primary duties, including a duties of openness and transparency; duties of recordkeeping, accounting, and disclosure. In addition, a trustee has a duty to know, understand, and abide by the terms of the trust and relevant law. The trustee may be compensated and have expenses reimbursed, but otherwise must turn over all profits from the trust properties.\n\nThere are strong restrictions regarding a trustee with conflict of interests. Courts can reverse a trustee's actions, order profits returned, and impose other sanctions if they finds a trustee has failed in any of their duties. Such a failure is termed a breach of trust and can leave a neglectful or dishonest trustee with severe liabilities for their failures. It is highly advisable for both settlors and trustees to seek qualified legal counsel prior to entering into a trust agreement.\n\nA possible early concept which later developed into what today is understood as a trust related to land. An ancient king (settlor) grants property back to its previous owner (beneficiary) during his absence, supported by witness testimony (trustee). In essence and in this case, the king, in place of the later state (trustor and holder of assets at highest position) issues ownership along with past proceeds to the original beneficiary:\nRoman law had a well-developed concept of the trust (\"fideicommissum\") in terms of \"testamentary trusts\" created by wills but never developed the concept of the \"inter vivos\" (living) trusts which apply while the creator lives. This was created by later common law jurisdictions. Personal trust law developed in England at the time of the Crusades, during the 12th and 13th centuries. In medieval English trust law, the settlor was known as the \"feoffor\" to uses while the trustee was known as the \"feoffee\" to uses and the beneficiary was known as the \"cestui que\" use, or \"cestui que\" trust.\n\nAt the time, land ownership in England was based on the feudal system. When a landowner left England to fight in the Crusades, he conveyed ownership of his lands in his absence to manage the estate and pay and receive feudal dues, on the understanding that the ownership would be conveyed back on his return. However, Crusaders often encountered refusal to hand over the property upon their return. Unfortunately for the Crusader, English common law did not recognize his claim. As far as the King's courts were concerned, the land belonged to the trustee, who was under no obligation to return it. The Crusader had no legal claim. The disgruntled Crusader would then petition the king, who would refer the matter to his Lord Chancellor. The Lord Chancellor could decide a case according to his conscience. At this time, the principle of equity was born.\n\nThe Lord Chancellor would consider it \"unconscionable\" that the legal owner could go back on his word and deny the claims of the Crusader (the \"true\" owner). Therefore, he would find in favour of the returning Crusader. Over time, it became known that the Lord Chancellor's court (the Court of Chancery) would continually recognize the claim of a returning Crusader. The legal owner would hold the land for the benefit of the original owner and would be compelled to convey it back to him when requested. The Crusader was the \"beneficiary\" and the acquaintance the \"trustee\". The term \"use of land\" was coined, and in time developed into what we now know as a \"trust\".\n\nThe trust is widely considered to be the most innovative contribution of the English legal system. Today, trusts play a significant role in most common law systems, and their success has led some civil law jurisdictions to incorporate trusts into their civil codes. In Curaçao, for example, the trust was enacted into law on 1 January 2012; however, the Curaçao Civil Code only allows express trusts constituted by notarial instrument. France has recently added a similar, Roman-law-based device to its own law with the \"fiducie\", amended in 2009; the \"fiducie\", unlike a trust, is a contractual relationship. Trusts are widely used internationally, especially in countries within the English law sphere of influence, and whilst most civil law jurisdictions do not generally contain the concept of a trust within their legal systems, they do recognise the concept under the Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Trusts and on their Recognition (partly only the extent that they are parties thereto). The Hague Convention also regulates conflict of trusts.\n\nAlthough trusts are often associated with intrafamily wealth transfers, they have become very important in American capital markets, particularly through pension funds (in certain countries essentially always trusts) and mutual funds (often trusts).\n\nProperty of any sort may be held in a trust. The uses of trusts are many and varied, for both personal and commercial reasons, and trusts may provide benefits in estate planning, asset protection, and taxes. Living trusts may be created during a person's life (through the drafting of a trust instrument) or after death in a will.\n\nIn a relevant sense, a trust can be viewed as a generic form of a corporation where the settlors (investors) are also the beneficiaries. This is particularly evident in the Delaware business trust, which could theoretically, with the language in the \"governing instrument\", be organized as a cooperative corporation or a limited liability corporation, although traditionally the Massachusetts business trust has been commonly used in the US. One of the most significant aspects of trusts is the ability to partition and shield assets from the trustee, multiple beneficiaries, and their respective creditors (particularly the trustee's creditors), making it \"bankruptcy remote\", and leading to its use in pensions, mutual funds, and asset securitization as well protection of individual spendthrifts through the spendthrift trust.\n\n\n\nTrusts may be created by the expressed intentions of the settlor (express trusts) or they may be created by operation of law known as implied trusts. An implied trust is one created by a court of equity because of acts or situations of the parties. Implied trusts are divided into two categories: resulting and constructive. A resulting trust is implied by the law to work out the presumed intentions of the parties, but it does not take into consideration their expressed intent. A constructive trust is a trust implied by law to work out justice between the parties, regardless of their intentions.\n\nTypically a trust can be created in the following four ways:\n\nIn some jurisdictions certain types of assets may not be the subject of a trust without a written document.\n\nThe formalities required of a trust depends on the type of trust in question.\n\nGenerally, a private express trust requires three elements to be certain, which together are known as the \"three certainties\". These elements were determined in \"Knight v Knight\" to be intention, subject matter and objects. The certainty of intention allows the court to ascertain a settlor's true reason for creating the trust. The certainties of subject matter and objects allow the court to administer trust when the trustees fail to do so. The court determines whether there is sufficient certainty by construing the words used in the trust instrument. These words are construed objectively in their \"reasonable meaning\", within the context of the entire instrument. Despite intention being integral to express trusts, the court will try not to let trusts fail for the lack of certainty.\n\n\nA trust may have multiple trustees, and these trustees are the legal owners of the trust's property, but have a fiduciary duty to beneficiaries and various duties, such as a duty of care and a duty to inform. If trustees do not adhere to these duties, they may be removed through a legal action. The trustee may be either a person or a legal entity such as a company, but typically the trust itself is not an entity and any lawsuit must be against the trustees. A trustee has many rights and responsibilities which vary based on the jurisdiction and trust instrument. If a trust lacks a trustee, a court may appoint a trustee.\n\nThe trustees administer the affairs attendant to the trust. The trust's affairs may include prudently investing the assets of the trust, accounting for and reporting periodically to the beneficiaries, filing required tax returns and other duties. In some cases dependent upon the trust instrument, the trustees must make discretionary decisions as to whether beneficiaries should receive trust assets for their benefit. A trustee may be held personally liable for problems, although fiduciary liability insurance similar to directors and officers liability insurance can be purchased. For example, a trustee could be liable if assets are not properly invested. In addition, a trustee may be liable to its beneficiaries even where the trust has made a profit but consent has not been given. However, in the United States, similar to directors and officers, an exculpatory clause may minimize liability; although this was previously held to be against public policy, this position has changed.\n\nIn the United States, the Uniform Trust Code provides for reasonable compensation and reimbursement for trustees subject to review by courts, although trustees may be unpaid. Commercial banks acting as trustees typically charge about 1% of assets under management.\n\nThe beneficiaries are beneficial (or 'equitable') owners of the trust property. Either immediately or eventually, the beneficiaries will receive income from the trust property, or they will receive the property itself. The extent of a beneficiary's interest depends on the wording of the trust document. One beneficiary may be entitled to income (for example, interest from a bank account), whereas another may be entitled to the entirety of the trust property when he attains the age of twenty-five years. The settlor has much discretion when creating the trust, subject to some limitations imposed by law.\n\nThe use of trusts as a means to inherit substantial wealth may be associated with some negative connotations; some beneficiaries who are able to live comfortably from trust proceeds without having to work a job may be jokingly referred to as \"trust fund babies\" (regardless of age) or \"trustafarians\".\n\nCommon purposes for trusts include:\n\nTrusts go by many different names, depending on the characteristics or the purpose of the trust. Because trusts often have multiple characteristics or purposes, a single trust might accurately be described in several ways. For example, a living trust is often an express trust, which is also a revocable trust, and might include an incentive trust, and so forth.\n\n\nTrusts originated in England, and therefore English trusts law has had a significant influence, particularly among common law legal systems such as the United States and the countries of the Commonwealth.\n\nTrust law in civil law jurisdictions, generally including Continental Europe only exists in a limited number of jurisdictions (e.g. Curaçao, Liechtenstein and Sint Maarten). The trust may however be recognized as an instrument of foreign law in conflict of laws cases, for example within the Brussels regime (Europe) and the parties to the Hague Trust Convention. Tax avoidance concerns have historically been one of the reasons that European countries with a civil law system have been reluctant to adopt trusts.\n\nState law applies to trusts, and the Uniform Trust Code has been enacted by the legislatures in many states. In addition, federal law considerations such as federal taxes administered by the Internal Revenue Service may affect the structure and creation of trusts. The common law of trusts is summarized in the Restatements of the Law, such as the Restatement of Trusts, Third (2003−08).\n\nIn the United States the tax law allows trusts to be taxed as corporations, partnerships, or not at all depending on the circumstances, although trusts may be used for tax avoidance in certain situations. For example, the trust-preferred security is a hybrid (debt and equity) security with favorable tax treatment which is treated as regulatory capital on banks' balance sheets. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act changed this somewhat by not allowing these assets to be a part of (large) banks' regulatory capital.\n\nLiving trusts, as opposed to testamentary (will) trusts, may help a trustor avoid probate. Avoiding probate may save costs and maintain privacy and living trusts have become very popular. Probate is potentially costly, and probate records are available to the public while distribution through a trust is private. Both living trusts and wills can also be used to plan for unforeseen circumstances such as incapacity or disability, by giving discretionary powers to the trustee or executor of the will.\n\nNegative aspects of using a living trust as opposed to a will and probate include upfront legal expenses, the expense of trust administration, and a lack of certain safeguards. The cost of the trust may be 1% of the estate per year versus the one-time probate cost of 1 to 4% for probate, which applies whether or not there is a drafted will. Unlike trusts, wills must be signed by two to three witnesses, the number depending on the law of the jurisdiction in which the will is executed. Legal protections that apply to probate but do not automatically apply to trusts include provisions that protect the decedent's assets from mismanagement or embezzlement, such as requirements of bonding, insurance, and itemized accountings of probate assets.\n\nLiving trusts generally do not shelter assets from the U.S. federal estate tax. Married couples may, however, effectively double the estate tax exemption amount by setting up the trust with a formula clause.\n\nFor a living trust, the grantor may retain some level of control to the trust, such by appointment as protector under the trust instrument. Living trusts also, in practical terms, tend to be driven to large extent by tax considerations. If a living trust fails, the property will usually be held for the grantor/settlor on resulting trusts, which in some notable cases, has had catastrophic tax consequences.\n\nIn many ways trusts in South Africa operate similarly to other common law countries, although the law of South Africa is actually a hybrid of the British common law system and Roman-Dutch law.\n\nIn South Africa, in addition to the traditional living trusts and will trusts there is a ‘bewind trust’ (inherited from the Roman-Dutch \"bewind\" administered by a \"bewindhebber\") in which the beneficiaries own the trust assets while the trustee administers the trust, although this is regarded by modern Dutch law as not actually a trust. \"Bewind\" trusts are created as trading vehicles providing trustees with limited liability and certain tax advantages.\n\nIn South Africa, minor children cannot inherit assets and in the absence of a trust and assets held in a state institution, the Guardian's Fund, and released to the children in adulthood. Therefore, testamentary (will) trusts often leave assets in a trust for the benefit of these minor children.\n\nThere are two types of living trusts in South Africa, namely vested trusts and discretionary trusts. In vested trusts, the benefits of the beneficiaries are set out in the trust deed, whereas in discretionary trusts the trustees have full discretion at all times as to how much and when each beneficiary is to benefit.\n\nUntil recently, there were tax advantages to living trusts in South Africa, although most of these advantages have been removed. Protection of assets from creditors is a modern advantage. With notable exceptions, assets held by the trust are not owned by the trustees or the beneficiaries, the creditors of trustees or beneficiaries can have no claim against the trust. Under the Insolvency Act (Act 24 of 1936), assets transferred into a living trust remain at risk from external creditors for 6 months if the previous owner of the assets is solvent at the time of transfer, or 24 months if he/she is insolvent at the time of transfer. After 24 months, creditors have no claim against assets in the trust, although they can attempt to attach the loan account, thereby forcing the trust to sell its assets. Assets can be transferred into the living trust by selling it to the trust (through a loan granted to the trust) or donating cash to it (any natural person can donate R100 000 per year without attracting donations tax; 20% donations tax applies to further donations within the same tax year).\n\nUnder South African law living trusts are considered tax payers. Two types of tax apply to living trusts, namely income tax and capital gains tax (CGT). A trust pays income tax at a flat rate of 40% (individuals pay according to income scales, usually less than 20%). The trust's income can, however, be taxed in the hands of either the trust or the beneficiary. A trust pays CGT at the rate of 20% (individuals pay 10%). Trusts do not pay deceased estate tax (although trusts may be required to pay back outstanding loans to a deceased estate, in which the loan amounts are taxable with deceased estate tax).\n\nThe taxpayer whose residence has been ‘locked’ into a trust has now been given another opportunity to take advantage of these CGT exemptions. The Taxation Law Amendment Act of 30 September 2009 commenced on 1 January 2010 and granted a 2-year window period from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011, affording a natural person the opportunity to take transfer of the residence with advantage of no transfer duty being payable or CGT consequences. Whilst taxpayers can take advantage of this opening of a window of opportunity, it is not likely that it will ever become available thereafter.\n\n\n\n"}
