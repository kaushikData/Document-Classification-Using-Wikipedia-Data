In the event of default, it was agreed that there would be compensation between the credit agreement and the term deposit.\n\nIn November 2000, Camvrac defaulted on the credit agreement and later made an assignment in bankruptcy. As it had failed to remit source deductions with respect to income taxes and employment insurance premiums, which are subject to a deemed trust under the \"Income Tax Act\" (Canada) and the \"Employment Insurance Act\", the Crown gave the Caisse notice to pay the amount owing to the Crown from the proceeds of the deposit. The Caisse challenged the recovery process, contending that its obligation applied only to the \"proceeds from\" the property subject to the trust, and that in reality it had not received any \"proceeds from\" the term deposit certificate.\n\nMme Prothonotary Tabib of the Federal Court of Canada, at first instance, held that the term deposit constituted a benefit to the Caisse, and by extension the \"proceeds from a property\" must be construed as including any set-off or benefit received in exchange or in consideration of the property. As she observed:\n\nThe judgment was sustained at a full trial in the Federal Court by Pinard J, and subsequently at the Federal Court of Appeal in a ruling by Létourneau JA. The Caisse appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\nThe appeal was dismissed in a 5-2 ruling. Rothstein J wrote the ruling for the majority, and Deschamps J delivered a detailed dissent.\n\nThe primary issue was identified as to whether the Crown was the beneficial owner of Camvrac's term deposit to the extent of its liability to the Crown, under the deemed trust provisions of the Acts. Rothstein J held that it was:\n\nHe further held that the right of compensation under ss. 16721673 of the \"Civil Code of Quebec\" (analogous to the concept of set-off in the common-law provinces) can fall within the scope of a \"security interest\" as defined, but not in every case:\n\nIn the case at hand he held that it was:\n\nDeschamps J, in her analysis, held that the concept of \"security interest\" was not as broad as was expressed by Rothstein J:\n\nIn that regard, the following observations can be made in how this should be applied in Quebec:\n\nShe would have allowed the appeal, and remanded the case back to the trial judge, as compensation cannot be considered to be a \"security interest\": the Caisse's contractual right may be set up against the Crown, because the Crown cannot have more rights than Camvrac itself had.\n\nIn response to Deschamps J's dissent, Rothstein J stated the following:\n\nThe SCC ruling has proved to be controversial. Many legal scholars and commentators preferred Deschamps J's reasoning to that of Rothstein J's.\n\nAs the \"ITA\"'s definition of \"security interest\" is quite similar to that embodied in the various provincial \"Personal Property Security Acts\", lenders may be exposed to attack, not just from the Canada Revenue Agency but also from trustees in bankruptcy, and secured creditors from their depositors, if security interests are not perfected by registration in the common law provinces, or published as a movable hypothec without delivery in Quebec.\n\nThis decision has the potential to have a significant impact on insolvency practice across Canada. By increasing personal liability, it widens the scope of liability where not only financial institutions, but all persons both dealing with tax debtors and receiving payments while a deemed trust exists, may be liable.\n\nCash collateral agreements commonly rely on what has been called a \"triple cocktail\" of set-off, security interest and \"flawed asset\". In effect, \"Caisse Populaire\" stands for the proposition that the first and third element of the \"triple cocktail\" automatically combine to form the second, even though the lender may regard them as conceptually distinct.\n\nDerivative agreements such as those embodied in International Swaps and Derivatives Association contracts may also fall within the scope of the decision. Unlike in the United States, Canadian security interests in cash deposits are not perfected by control, as is allowed under Article 9 of the US \"Uniform Commercial Code\". Registration is the only option, which can expose a counterparty to the risk of subordination to prior registered interests. It has been argued, however, that in the case of title transfers of securities (or cash in a securities account), provincial \"Securities Transfer Acts\" or other laws similar to UCC's Article 8 would ensure that the collateral taker should be perfected by control.\n\nLenders have been advised to take several steps to minimize the risk of exposure in such situations:\n\n"}
{"id": "228043", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=228043", "title": "Campsite", "text": "Campsite\n\nA campsite or camping pitch is a place used for overnight stay in an outdoor area. In UK English, a \"campsite\" is an area, usually divided into a number of pitches, where people can camp overnight using tents or camper vans or caravans; this UK English use of the word is synonymous with the US English expression \"campground\". In American English, the term \"campsite\" generally means an area where an individual, family, group, or military unit can pitch a tent or park a camper; a campground may contain many campsites.\n\nThere are two types of campsites:\n\nThe term \"camp\" comes from the Latin word \"campus\", meaning \"field\". Therefore, a campground consists typically of open pieces of ground where a camper can pitch a tent or park a camper. More specifically a campsite is a dedicated area set aside for camping and for which often a user fee is charged. Campsites typically feature a few (but sometimes no) improvements.\n\nDedicated campsites, known as \"Campgrounds\", usually have some amenities. Common amenities include, listed roughly in order from most to least common:\n\nCampgrounds may include further amenities:\n\nCamping outside a designated campsite may be forbidden by law. It is thought to be a nuisance, harmful to the environment, and is often associated with vagrancy. However some countries have specific laws and/or regulations allowing camping on public lands (see \"Freedom to roam\"). In the United States, many national and state parks have dedicated campsites and sometimes also allow impromptu backcountry camping by visitors. U.S. National Forests often have established campsites, but generally allow camping anywhere, except within a certain distance of water sources or developed areas. Camping may also be prohibited in certain ‘special areas’ of national forests containing unusual landforms or vegetation. And if conditions allow campfires, a campfire permit is required for campfires outside of developed campsites.\n\nIn Britain, it is more commonly known as \"wild camping\", and is mostly illegal. However, Scotland has a relaxed view and wild camping is legal in the majority of Scotland.\n\nIn many parts of Canada, \"roughing it\" is considered to be wilderness camping on government owned, public land known as crown land and commonly called \"the bush\". There are no amenities of any kind and typically no development except for possibly logging roads or ATV trails, and few rules beyond the requirement in some provinces to move the site at least 100 metres every 21 days.\n\nIn North America many campgrounds have facilities for Recreational Vehicles and are also known as RV parks. Similar facilities in the UK are known as Caravan Parks. The Kampgrounds of America (KOA) is a large chain of commercial campgrounds located throughout the United States and Canada. Many travellers prefer to use KOA, or similar campsites, as an alternative to hotels or motels.\n\nBoth commercial and governmental campgrounds typically charge a nominal fee for the privilege of camping there, to cover expenses, and in the case of an independent campground, to make a profit. However, there are some in North America that do not charge a use fee and rely on sources such as donations and tax dollars. Staying the night in a big-box store parking lot is also common (called \"boondocking\"), and some retailers welcome RVs to their parking lots.\nSome RV parks provide year-round spaces.\n\nFrequently confused with campsites, campgrounds and RV parks, trailer parks are made up of long term or semi-permanent residents occupying mobile homes, park trailers or RVs.\n\nThe holiday park is a United Kingdom version of the North American trailer park. Created to allow coastal resorts to enable temporary and high-income accommodation to be easily created, under UK planning laws, no residents are permanent, and the park must be wholly shut to all for at least two months each year. All of the mobile homes are either available for rent from the land owner, or pitches are leased on a long-term basis from the land owner and the lease's own mobile home placed on the pitch. Permanent sites owners lease includes the provision by the land owner of water, sewerage and general site and grounds maintenance. Some holiday parks includes a small campsite for those touring the area, where they can pay to pitch tents or site touring caravans and motorhomes. Touring campsites have full access to the Holiday parks facilities, including clothes washing and showering. Most holiday parks include a central entertainments block, which can include a shop, restaurants, and a multi-purpose theatre used for both stage and activity-based entertainment.\n\nCaravan Holiday Homes\n\nHoliday parks vary in size and type, as do the kinds of accommodation available within them. Caravans are a popular choice with holiday makers, and modern varieties come complete with features like double glazing and central heating, cookers, fridges, showers, hot/cold water supplies, electricity and gas mains input. A standard caravan is a single unit, built to a maximum of 14 feet wide.\n\nOther types of mobile home include Lodges and Park Homes which are more expensive than caravans and offer more luxurious features. Higher end Lodges can be built using some of the same methods as traditional bricks and mortar buildings and include familiar materials like plasterboard and tongue and groove walls for an end result that’s very similar to a standard house. A standard lodge uses similar materials as a standard caravan such as wood, gypsum board and plywood where the main difference being the extra width. Lodges and Parkhomes can come in sizes up to 22 feet wide and 45 feet long, making them a popular choice with big families and large groups.\n\nHoliday homes can be rented on an ad-hoc basis or purchased – caravans can be purchased from around £30,000 while park homes and lodges can cost between £100,000 and £500,000.\n\nCertificated & Certified Locations are smaller privately owned caravan sites which have to be approved by the UK based Camping & Caravanning Club and The Caravan Club (and other organisations). These campsites are normally reserved exclusively for Club members. These smaller campsites are allowed to operate under The Public Health Act 1936 and The Caravan and Control of Development Act 1960.\n\nIn the U.S., \"backcountry camping\" is common in large undeveloped protected areas. These areas can only be reached on foot, bicycle, canoe or on horseback. The camping areas are usually established campsites or \"zones\", which have a predetermined maximum number of persons that are allowed to stay in the section per night. Strict regulations are imposed regarding food storage and resource protection. Usually in organized parks or wilderness areas, backcountry campsites require a permit, which may be free, obtainable at visitor centers and ranger stations. Dispersed camping in other areas may not require a permit.\n\nAs with camping, campgrounds predated the automobile. When President Theodore Roosevelt addressed Congress in 1901, he called for the creation of free campgrounds on Federal lands. Already four national parks—Yellowstone, Sequoia, Yosemite, and Mount Rainier—were established and by the time Congress formally established the National Park Service in 1916, America had a dozen national parks.\n\nWhile a handful of campgrounds, both public and private, could be found at tourist destinations, as late as 1936 it was still difficult to find places to stop along the route to these parks. Instead, it was common for motorists to pull off the road and set up camp on private property. This practice not only reinforced the negative, nomadic image of RV travelers, it was a detriment to expanding the trailer market. The Trailer Coach Manufacturers Association began to lobby states to establish sanitation standards and worked with civic and business leaders to establish additional campgrounds, emphasizing the economic benefits of a campground in their community. The Denver Civic Association wrote that a campground was just as essential to a town as a railway station. The trailer industry's efforts were effective. The number of campgrounds in the Trailer Travel Magazine's directory of campgrounds doubled to 1,650 by the end of 1936 and promised to double again by the end of 1937.\n\nThe campgrounds themselves also changed. Martin Hogue wrote, “The first public campgrounds in the United States were nothing more than large, dedicated clearings, free of trees, within which to concentrate groups of tourists.” A plant pathologist named Emilio Meinecke, was commissioned to study the effect of motor tourism in the Redwoods in 1929. Meinicke's recommendations explained that instead of allowing campers to park haphazardly within a park, the camper's impact on the environment could be minimized through campground roads forming a one-way loop leading to individual parking spurs next to each campsite. Although he would later continue to write of the effect of campers on nature, submitting a memorandum to the National Forest Service in 1935 entitled “The Trailer Menace,” he had established the basic design for campgrounds still used today.\n\n"}
{"id": "27327454", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27327454", "title": "Capitalist peace", "text": "Capitalist peace\n\nThe capitalist peace, or capitalist peace theory, posits that according to a given criterion for economic development (capitalism), developed economies have not engaged in war with each other, and rarely enter into low-level disputes. These theories have been proposed as an explanation for the democratic peace theory by accounting for both democracy and the peace among democratic nations. The exact nature of the causality depends upon both the proposed variable and the measure of the indicator for the concept used.\n\nThe philosophical roots of capitalist peace can be traced back to Immanuel Kant, Joseph Schumpeter, Norman Angell, and classical economic theory. In his 1795 essay Perpetual Peace, Immanuel Kant argued, among other things, that \"the spirit of commerce . . . sooner or later takes hold of every nation, and is incompatible with war.\" In the early twentieth century Norman Angell reasoned that trade interdependence in modern economies makes war unprofitable. Later, Joseph Schumpeter offered the observation that with the advancement of capitalism people form \"an unwarlike disposition.\"\n\nThe modern capitalist peace emerged with the democratic peace. In one of the earliest systematic confirmations of the democratic peace, Stuart Bremer also examined the relationship between capitalism and war. He found capitalism to be a more powerful force for peace than democracy, yet the democratic peace accrued much more attention in the academic and policy literature. Today at least four theories of capitalist peace can be identified, with some of these theories claiming that a capitalist peace may subsume the democratic one, given that capitalism may be the cause of both democracy and peace.\n\nA key to explaining the capitalist peace rests on the indicative measures for capitalism. There are at least four different definitions of capitalism currently being employed. \n\nA number of models of the capitalist peace equate free markets with capitalism. In this usage, free markets and trade cause economic development, which in turn accounts for the peace among nations with advanced economies.\n\nA second understanding of capitalism is one that is conceptualized based on the intensity of market contracting in a society, where a capitalist economy is defined as one where most actors in the economy are integrated by contracting in the market. By definition contracts must be voluntary and undertaken without coercion.\n\nIn the third measure for capitalism inter-state trade is seen as an indicator for a developed, hence a capitalist economy. The level of trade interdependence, therefore, is the operationalized measure of this third type of capitalism.\n\nThe final way that capitalism has been measured is with the size of government. States that have limited governments, hence large private sectors, are supposed to be capitalist economies. The size of government is used as an indicator for the level of capitalism a state has achieved.\n\nThere are five primary theories that have attempted to explain the capitalist peace, each of which has used one of the above definitions of capitalism. Each theory has achieved varying levels of success and empirical corroboration, although they all rely on capitalism as the main explanatory variable for peace.\n\nThe interdependent trade explanation for the capitalist peace is built on the foundations of classical economic theory. This idea, which can be traced back to Kant, became the original theoretical explanation for the capitalist peace. In 1996, Erich Weede tied trade and free markets to development and peace, proposing that trade interdependence caused peace between nations. Weede followed this up with what he called the \"capitalist peace\". However, the empirical findings of the link between trade and development have been drawn into question, as one study found that the proportion of GDP to foreign trade is only 0.08, measured by logged GDP per capita.\n\nEconomic norms theory links the economic conditions of clientelism, which prevail in many lower income societies, and a contract-intensive economy, which prevails in many higher income societies, with divergent political interests and habits.\n\nEconomic norms theory arose as an alternative explanation to the democratic peace, because it identified the causal relationship between democracy and peace as spurious. Michael Mousseau identified contract-intensive economies as a possible cause of both democracy and peace. The explanation is based on two aspects widely accepted in social science: (1) bounded rationality; and (2) divergent hierarchies between clientelism and contract-intensive economies. In contract-intensive societies, individuals have a loyalty towards the state that enforces the contracts between strangers. As a consequence, individuals in these societies expect that their states enforce contracts reliably and impartially, protect individual rights, and make efforts to enhance the general welfare. Moreover, with the assumption of bounded rationality, individuals routinely dependent on trusting strangers in contracts will develop the habits of trusting strangers and preferring universal rights, impartial law, and liberal democratic government. In contrast, individuals in contract-poor societies will develop the habits of abiding by the commands of group leaders, and distrusting those from out-groups.\n\nAccording to economic norms theory, the people in contract-rich nations enjoy a permanent and positive peace. As long as their states accede to popular demands and remain reliably impartial, individuals in nations with contract intensive economies have an interest in everyone’s rights and material welfare, within and outside the nation. Consequently, contract-intensive nations not only avoid war with each other but engage in intense levels of mutual cooperation specifically aimed at promoting each other's material welfare. Leaders of nations with contract-poor economies, in contrast, pursue the interests of their dominant groups and have no interest in the security or welfare of members of out-groups, whether they are internal or external to the nation.\n\nThis theory, originally introduced by EriK Gartzke, Quan Li, and Charles Boehmer, argues that nations with a high level of capital openness are able to avoid conflict with each other and maintain a lasting peace. In particular, nations with freer capital markets are more dependent on international investors, because the investors are likely to withdraw if the country is engaged in a war or inter-state conflict. As a result, leaders of states give greater credibility to threats made by countries with higher levels of capital openness, causing the aforementioned countries to be more peaceful than others by avoiding the possibility of misrepresentation of information. One particular advantage of this theory is that it has been formalized, which helps ensure its internal consistency. The 2007 study performed by Gartzke claimed to make the democratic peace variable insignificant when capital openness was controlled for, but a later re-examination found this study to have several design errors. Using measured logged GDP per capita, development correlates with openness to foreign capital at 0.14, slightly higher than trade. Furthermore, the most recent study failed to control for the variables of economic norms theory and the size of government explanation.\n\nThe size of government explanation for the capitalist peace relies on the fourth definition of capitalism. Introduced by Patrick J. McDonald, the idea is that smaller governments are more dependent than larger or socialist governments on raising taxes for fighting wars. This makes the commitments of nations with smaller governments more credible than those with larger ones, allowing for nations with smaller governments, and thus \"capitalist\" economies, to be better positioned for avoiding conflicts.\n\nThis theory, adduces that if men want to oppose war, it is statism that they must oppose. So long as they hold the tribal notion that the individual is sacrificial fodder for the collective, that some men have the right to rule others by force, and that some (any) alleged \"good\" can justify it—there can be no peace within a nation and no peace among nations. \n\nIn Thomas L. Friedman's 1999 book \"The Lexus and the Olive Tree\", the following observation was presented: \"No two countries that both had McDonald's had fought a war against each other since each got its McDonald's\". He supported that observation, as a theory, by stating that when a country has reached an economic development where it has a middle class strong enough to support a McDonald's network, it would become a \"McDonald's country\", and will not be interested in fighting wars anymore.\n\nShortly after the book was published, NATO bombed Yugoslavia. On the first day of the bombing, McDonald's restaurants in Belgrade were demolished by angry protesters and were rebuilt only after the bombing ended. In the 2000 edition of the book, Friedman argued that this exception proved the rule: the war ended quickly, he argued, partly because the Serbian population did not want to lose their place in a global system \"symbolised by McDonald's\" (Friedman 2000: 252–253).\n\nCritics have pointed to two other conflicts fought before 2000 as counterexamples, depending on what one considers \"a war\":\n\n\nIn 2005, Friedman said that he framed this theory in terms of McDonald's Golden Arches \"with tongue slightly in cheek\". In his 2005 book \"The World is Flat\" he offered an updated theory he labelled the Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention.\n\nSince 2005, there have been three more conflicts cited as counterexamples:\n\n\nFriedman's point is that due to globalization, countries that have made strong economic ties with one another have too much to lose to ever go to war with one another. Regardless of whether the statement is true, the conclusions to be drawn are unclear. The global expansion of McDonald's restaurants is a relatively recent phenomenon when put into the context of the history of warfare, and, with a few notable exceptions, has proceeded into relatively stable markets.\n\nThe Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention, also known as simply the Dell Theory, has been presented by Thomas Friedman in his book \"The World Is Flat\". This theory is an updated version of his previous \"Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention\".\n\nThat is, as long as corporations have major supply chain operations in countries other than that corporation's home country, those countries will never engage in armed conflicts. This is due to the economic interdependence between nations that arises from a large corporation (such as Dell) having supply chain operations in multiple global locations and the reluctance of developing nations (in which supply chain operations commonly take place) to give up their newfound wealth.\n\nIn his previous book \"The Lexus and the Olive Tree\", Friedman argued that no two nations with a McDonald's franchise had ever gone to war with one another: this was known as the Golden Arches theory. Later, Friedman upgraded that theory into the \"Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention\" by saying that people or nations don't just want to have a better standard of living as symbolized by McDonald's franchise in their downtown, but want to have the lump of the labour sector that is created by globalization. That is, developing nations do not want to risk the trust of the multi-national companies who venture into their markets and include them in the global supply chain.\n\nThomas Friedman also warns in his book \"The World Is Flat\" that the Dell Theory should not be interpreted as a guarantee that nations who are deeply involved in global supply chains will not go to war with each other. It rather means that the governments of these nations and their citizens will have very heavy economic costs to consider as they contemplate the possibility of war. These costs include the long-term loss of the country's profitable participation in the global supply chain.\n\nThis theory relates with how conflict prevention occurred between India and Pakistan in their 2001 - 2002 nuclear standoff, where India was at risk of losing its global partners. The relationship between the People's Republic of China and Taiwan was also cited as an example of this theory - they both have strong supply relations with each other and a war between the two seems very unlikely today.\n\n"}

In June 2002, the CEOOR lodged another complaint against the Belgian Arab European League, also for racism.\n\nThe Centre has been criticized by, among others, Matthias Storme. Storme sees the Centre as leading a \"political inquisition\" in suppressing alternative political views. Storme was earlier successful in fighting a case before the Belgian Supreme Court, where he showed that some articles of the Belgian \"anti-discrimination law\" were in violation with the constitutionally protected right of freedom of speech. However, Storme himself was named in 2014 as administrator of this Interfederal Centre. Another publisher at \"The Brussels Journal\", Paul Beliën, withdrew a text upon the Centre's officially filed complaint.\n\nOn 21 July 2004, the Centre together with the Dutch-speaking Human Rights League in Belgium received the country's annual \"Democracy Award\". It is given to persons or organisations that \"protect or enhance political democracy or facilitate the participation of citizens in society\". The jury from the organisations, \"Trefpunt\" and the anti-globalist \"Democratie 2000\", awarded this prize to the Centre and Liga for their role in the condemnation of the Vlaams Blok in a case before the Ghent Court of Appeals.\n\nIn November 2010, the Centre came under scrutiny and received protests from Parliamentarians after that it was confronted with anti-Judaic texts published on their website regarding stoning of women.

The first, Richard Wright's, \"Native Son\" (1941), opened at the St. James Theatre on Broadway on 24 March 1941. Wright's novel had firmly laid the responsibility for Bigger’s brutality on the doorstep of white America, but in adapting the novel to the stage, Paul Green, a southern folk dramatist, had insisted that Bigger take some responsibility for the murders he had committed. John Houseman and Orson Welles preferred Wright’s original concepts and discarded the modifications made by Green, which had softened Bigger’s character. When Green saw the play he was angered and later published his own version. Canada Lee created the role of Bigger Thomas, receiving near unanimous praise from the critics. The production ran for 114 straight performances before touring major US cities and returning to New York to run for an additional eighty-four performances before closing, in part because of America’s declared war on 7 December 1941, which had refocused the nation’s attention. \n\nThe second civil rights drama, \"Strange Fruit\" (1945), set in a small Georgia town, had been adapted from Lilian Smith’s controversial novel. Staged by José Ferrer, the play featured 23-year-old Jane White as Nonnie, a black girl made pregnant by a white boy played by Mel Ferrer. Other Blacks in the cast were Juano Hernandez, Edna Thomas, Alonzo Bosan, Ken Renard, and Dorothy Carter. Robert Earl Jones played the lynch victim. The play lasted for sixty performances, in part because Eleanor Roosevelt wrote enthusiastically about it in her syndicated column, “My Day.” \n\nAfter the Allies defeated Germany and Japan in 1945, black soldiers returned home to segregated housing. On Whitman Avenue (1946), a civil rights drama on discrimination in the renting and sale of housing, starred Canada Lee, this time playing a decorated war hero trying to move his family into a white neighborhood. Abbie Mitchell, Augustus Smith, and Peter Morell played the members of Lee’s family. Margo Jones, from Dallas, Texas, directed the drama, which was written by Maxine Wood. In response to unenthusiastic reviews, Eleanor Roosevelt observed in her weekly column that the American people were in a period of retrogression and did not want to be reminded of their shortcomings. With Roosevelt’s help and that of Langston Hughes, the play remained alive for 148 performances.\n\n"}

The objective of the Congress was to provide a long-term peace plan for Europe by settling critical issues arising from the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. The goal was not simply to restore old boundaries but to resize the main powers so they could balance each other and remain at peace. The leaders were conservatives with little use for republicanism or revolution, both of which threatened to upset the status quo in Europe. France lost all its recent conquests while Prussia, Austria and Russia made major territorial gains. Prussia added smaller German states in the west, Swedish Pomerania and 60% of the Kingdom of Saxony; Austria gained Venice and much of northern Italy. Russia gained parts of Poland. The new Kingdom of the Netherlands had been created just months before, and included formerly Austrian territory that in 1830 became Belgium.\nThe immediate background was Napoleonic France's defeat and surrender in May 1814, which brought an end to 25 years of nearly continuous war. Negotiations continued despite the outbreak of fighting triggered by Napoleon's dramatic return from exile and resumption of power in France during the Hundred Days of March to July 1815. The Congress's \"final act\" was signed nine days before his final defeat at Waterloo on 18 June 1815.\n\nThe Congress has often been criticized for causing the subsequent suppression of the emerging national and liberal movements, and it has been seen as a reactionary movement for the benefit of traditional monarchs. However, others praise it for having created relatively long-term stability and peaceful conditions in most of Europe.\n\nIn a technical sense, the \"Congress of Vienna\" was not properly a congress: it never met in plenary session, and most of the discussions occurred in informal, face-to-face sessions among the Great Powers of Austria, Britain, France, Russia, and sometimes Prussia, with limited or no participation by other delegates. On the other hand, the congress was the first occasion in history where, on a continental scale, national representatives came together to formulate treaties instead of relying mostly on messages among the several capitals. The Congress of Vienna settlement, despite later changes, formed the framework for European international politics until the outbreak of the First World War in 1914.\n\nThe Treaty of Chaumont in 1814 had reaffirmed decisions that had been made already and that would be ratified by the more important Congress of Vienna of 1814-15. They included the establishment of a confederated Germany, the division of Italy into independent states, the restoration of the Bourbon kings of Spain, and the enlargement of the Netherlands to include what in 1830 became modern Belgium. The Treaty of Chaumont became the cornerstone of the European Alliance that formed the balance of power for decades. Other partial settlements had already occurred at the Treaty of Paris between France and the Sixth Coalition, and the Treaty of Kiel that covered issues raised regarding Scandinavia. The Treaty of Paris had determined that a \"general congress\" should be held in Vienna and that invitations would be issued to \"all the Powers engaged on either side in the present war\". The opening was scheduled for July 1814.\n\nThe Congress functioned through formal meetings such as working groups and official diplomatic functions; however, a large portion of the Congress was conducted informally at salons, banquets, and balls.\n\nThe Four Great Powers had previously formed the core of the Sixth Coalition. On the verge of Napoleon's defeat they had outlined their common position in the Treaty of Chaumont (March 1814), and negotiated the Treaty of Paris (1814) with the Bourbons during their restoration:\n\nThese parties had not been part of the Chaumont agreement, but had joined the Treaty of Paris (1814):\n\n\nVirtually every state in Europe had a delegation in Vienna – more than 200 states and princely houses were represented at the Congress. In addition, there were representatives of cities, corporations, religious organizations (for instance, abbeys) and special interest groups – e.g., a delegation representing German publishers, demanding a copyright law and freedom of the press. The Congress was noted for its lavish entertainment: according to a famous joke it did not move, but danced.\n\nInitially, the representatives of the four victorious powers hoped to exclude the French from serious participation in the negotiations, but Talleyrand skillfully managed to insert himself into \"her inner councils\" in the first weeks of negotiations. He allied himself to a Committee of Eight lesser powers (including Spain, Sweden, and Portugal) to control the negotiations. Once Talleyrand was able to use this committee to make himself a part of the inner negotiations, he then left it, once again abandoning his allies.\n\nThe major Allies' indecision on how to conduct their affairs without provoking a united protest from the lesser powers led to the calling of a preliminary conference on protocol, to which Talleyrand and the Marquis of Labrador, Spain's representative, were invited on 30 September 1814.\n\nCongress Secretary Friedrich von Gentz reported, \"The intervention of Talleyrand and Labrador has hopelessly upset all our plans. Talleyrand protested against the procedure we have adopted and soundly [be]rated us for two hours. It was a scene I shall never forget.\" The embarrassed representatives of the Allies replied that the document concerning the protocol they had arranged actually meant nothing. \"If it means so little, why did you sign it?\" snapped Labrador.\n\nTalleyrand's policy, directed as much by national as personal ambitions, demanded the close but by no means amicable relationship he had with Labrador, whom Talleyrand regarded with disdain. Labrador later remarked of Talleyrand: \"that cripple, unfortunately, is going to Vienna.\" Talleyrand skirted additional articles suggested by Labrador: he had no intention of handing over the 12,000 \"afrancesados\" – Spanish fugitives, sympathetic to France, who had sworn fealty to Joseph Bonaparte, nor the bulk of the documents, paintings, pieces of fine art, and books that had been looted from the archives, palaces, churches and cathedrals of Spain.\nThe most dangerous topic at the Congress was the so-called Polish-Saxon Crisis. Russia wanted most of Poland, and Prussia wanted all of Saxony, whose king had allied with Napoleon. The tsar would become king of Poland. Austria was fearful this would make Russia much too powerful, a view which was supported by Britain. The result was deadlock, for which Talleyrand proposed a solution: Admit France to the inner circle, and France would support Austria and Britain. The three nations signed a secret treaty on 3 January 1815, agreeing to go to war against Russia and Prussia, if necessary, to prevent the Russo-Prussian plan from coming to fruition.\n\nWhen the tsar heard of the secret treaty he agreed to a compromise that satisfied all parties on 24 October 1815. Russia received most of the Napoleonic Duchy of Warsaw as a \"Kingdom of Poland\" – called Congress Poland, with the tsar as king ruling it independently of Russia. Russia, however, did not receive the province of Posen (Poznań), which was given to Prussia as the Grand Duchy of Posen, nor Kraków, which became a free city. Furthermore, the tsar was unable to unite the new domain with the parts of Poland that had been incorporated into Russia in the 1790s. Prussia received 60 percent of Saxony-later known as the Province of Saxony, with the remainder returned to King Frederick Augustus I as his Kingdom of Saxony.\n\nThe Final Act, embodying all the separate treaties, was signed on 9 June 1815 (a few days before the Battle of Waterloo). Its provisions included:\n\nThe Final Act was signed by representatives of Austria, France, Portugal, Prussia, Russia, Sweden-Norway, and Britain. Spain did not sign the treaty but ratified it in 1817.\n\nThe Congress's principal results, apart from its confirmation of France's loss of the territories annexed between 1795–1810, which had already been settled by the Treaty of Paris, were the enlargement of Russia, (which gained most of the Duchy of Warsaw) and Prussia, which acquired the district of Poznań, Swedish Pomerania, Westphalia and the northern Rhineland. The consolidation of Germany from the nearly 300 states of the Holy Roman Empire (dissolved in 1806) into a much less complex system of thirty-nine states (4 of which were free cities) was confirmed. These states formed a loose German Confederation under the leadership of Austria and Prussia.\n\nRepresentatives at the Congress agreed to numerous other territorial changes. By the Treaty of Kiel, Norway had been ceded by the king of Denmark-Norway to the king of Sweden. This sparked the nationalist movement which led to the establishment of the Kingdom of Norway on May 17, 1814 and the subsequent personal Union with Sweden. Austria gained Lombardy-Venetia in Northern Italy, while much of the rest of North-Central Italy went to Habsburg dynasties (the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, the Duchy of Modena, and the Duchy of Parma).\n\nThe Papal States were restored to the Pope. The Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia was restored to its mainland possessions, and also gained control of the Republic of Genoa. In Southern Italy, Napoleon's brother-in-law, Joachim Murat, was originally allowed to retain his Kingdom of Naples, but his support of Napoleon in the Hundred Days led to the restoration of the Bourbon Ferdinand IV to the throne.\n\nA large United Kingdom of the Netherlands was formed for the Prince of Orange, including both the old United Provinces and the formerly Austrian-ruled territories in the Southern Netherlands. Other, less important, territorial adjustments included significant territorial gains for the German Kingdoms of Hanover (which gained East Frisia from Prussia and various other territories in Northwest Germany) and Bavaria (which gained the Rhenish Palatinate and territories in Franconia). The Duchy of Lauenburg was transferred from Hanover to Denmark, and Prussia annexed Swedish Pomerania. Switzerland was enlarged, and Swiss neutrality was established. Swiss mercenaries had played a significant role in European wars for a couple of hundred years: the Congress intended to put a stop to these activities permanently.\n\nDuring the wars, Portugal had lost its town of Olivença to Spain and moved to have it restored. Portugal is historically Britain's oldest ally, and with British support succeeded in having the re-incorporation of Olivença decreed in Article 105 of the Final Act, which stated that the Congress \"understood the occupation of Olivença to be illegal and recognized Portugal's rights\". Portugal ratified the Final Act in 1815 but Spain would not sign, and this became the most important hold-out against the Congress of Vienna. Deciding in the end that it was better to become part of Europe than to stand alone, Spain finally accepted the Treaty on 7 May 1817; however, Olivença and its surroundings were never returned to Portuguese control and this question remains unresolved. Great Britain received parts of the West Indies at the expense of the Netherlands and Spain and kept the former Dutch colonies of Ceylon and the Cape Colony as well as Malta and Heligoland. Under the Treaty of Paris, Britain obtained a protectorate over the United States of the Ionian Islands and the Seychelles.\n\nThe Congress of Vienna has frequently been criticized by 19th century and more recent historians for ignoring national and liberal impulses, and for imposing a stifling reaction on the Continent. It was an integral part in what became known as the Conservative Order, in which the liberties and civil rights associated with the American and French Revolutions were de-emphasized, so that a fair balance of power, peace and stability, might be achieved.\n\nIn the 20th century, however, many historians came to admire the statesmen at the Congress, whose work prevented another widespread European war for nearly 100 years (1815–1914). Among these is Henry Kissinger, who in 1954 wrote his doctoral dissertation, \"A World Restored\", on it. Historian Mark Jarrett argues that the Congress of Vienna and the Congress System marked \"the true beginning of our modern era\". He says the Congress System was deliberate conflict management, and was the first genuine attempt to create an international order based upon consensus rather than conflict. \"Europe was ready,\" Jarrett states, \"to accept an unprecedented degree of international cooperation in response to the French Revolution.\" Historian Paul Schroeder argues that the old formulae for \"balance of power\" were in fact highly destabilizing and predatory. He says the Congress of Vienna avoided them and instead set up rules that produced a stable and benign equilibrium. The Congress of Vienna was the first of a series of international meetings that came to be known as the Concert of Europe, which was an attempt to forge a peaceful balance of power in Europe. It served as a model for later organizations such as the League of Nations in 1919 and the United Nations in 1945.\n\nBefore the opening of the Paris peace conference of 1918, the British Foreign Office commissioned a history of the Congress of Vienna to serve as an example to its own delegates of how to achieve an equally successful peace. Besides, the main decisions of the Congress were made by the Four Great Powers and not all the countries of Europe could extend their rights at the Congress. The Italian peninsula became a mere \"geographical expression\" as divided into seven parts: Lombardy–Venetia, Modena, Naples–Sicily, Parma, Piedmont–Sardinia, Tuscany, and the Papal States under the control of different powers. Poland remained partitioned between Russia, Prussia and Austria, with the largest part, the newly created Kingdom of Poland, remaining under Russian control.\n\nThe arrangements made by the Four Great Powers sought to ensure future disputes would be settled in a manner that would avoid the terrible wars of the previous 20 years. Although the Congress of Vienna preserved the balance of power in Europe, it could not check the spread of revolutionary movements across the continent some 30 years later.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7490670", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7490670", "title": "Conventionalism", "text": "Conventionalism\n\nConventionalism is the philosophical attitude that fundamental principles of a certain kind are grounded on (explicit or implicit) agreements in society, rather than on external reality. Although this attitude is commonly held with respect to the rules of grammar, its application to the propositions of ethics, law, science, mathematics, and logic is more controversial. \n\nThe debate on linguistic conventionalism goes back to Plato's \"Cratylus\" and the Mīmāṃsā philosophy of Kumārila Bhaṭṭa.\nIt has been the standard position of modern linguistics since Ferdinand de Saussure's \"l'arbitraire du signe\", but there have always been dissenting positions of phonosemantics, recently defended by Margaret Magnus and Vilayanur S. Ramachandran.\n\nThe French mathematician Henri Poincaré was among the first to articulate a conventionalist view. Poincaré's use of non-Euclidean geometries in his work on differential equations convinced him that Euclidean geometry should not be regarded as an \"a priori\" truth. He held that axioms in geometry should be chosen for the results they produce, not for their apparent coherence with –possibly flawed– human intuitions about the physical world.\n\nConventionalism was adopted by logical positivists, chiefly A. J. Ayer and Carl Hempel, and extended to both mathematics and logic. To deny rationalism, Ayer sees two options for empiricism regarding the necessity of the truth of formal logic (and mathematics): 1) deny that they actually are necessary, and then account for why they only appear so, or 2) claim that the truths of logic and mathematics lack factual content - they are not \"truths about the world\" - and then explain how they are nevertheless true and informative. John Stuart Mill adopted the former, which Ayer criticized, opting himself for the latter. Ayer's argument relies primarily on the analytic/synthetic distinction.\n\nThe French philosopher Pierre Duhem espoused a broader conventionalist view encompassing all of science. Duhem was skeptical that human perceptions are sufficient to understand the \"true,\" metaphysical nature of reality and argued that scientific laws should be valued mainly for their predictive power and correspondence with observations.\n\nKarl Popper broadened the meaning of conventionalism still more. In \"The Logic of Scientific Discovery\", he defined a \"conventionalist stratagem\" as any technique that is used by a theorist to evade the consequences of a falsifying observation or experiment. Popper identified four such stratagems: \n\n\nPopper argued that it was crucial to avoid conventionalist stratagems if falsifiability of a theory was to be preserved. It has been argued that the standard model of cosmology is built upon a set of conventionalist stratagems.\n\nConventionalism, as applied to legal philosophy is one of the three rival conceptions of law constructed by American legal philosopher Ronald Dworkin in his work \"Law's Empire\". The other two conceptions of law are legal pragmatism and law as integrity. \n\nAccording to conventionalism as defined by Dworkin, a community's legal institutions should contain clear social conventions relied upon which rules are promulgated. Such rules will serve as the sole source of information for all the community members because they demarcate clearly all the circumstances in which state coercion will and will not be exercised.\n\nDworkin nonetheless has argued that this justification fails to fit with facts as there are many occasions wherein clear applicable legal rules are absent. It follows that, as he maintained, conventionalism can provide no valid ground for state coercion. Dworkin himself favored law as integrity as the best justification of state coercion.\n\nOne famous criticism of Dworkin's idea comes from Stanley Fish who argues that Dworkin, like the Critical Legal Studies movement, Marxists and adherents of feminist jurisprudence, was guilty of a false 'Theory Hope'. Fish claims that such mistake stems from their mistaken belief that there exists a general or higher 'theory' that explains or constrains all fields of activity like state coercion.\n\nAnother criticism is based on Dworkin's assertion that positivists' claims amount to conventionalism. H. L. A. Hart, as a soft positivist, denies such claim as he had pointed out that citizens cannot always discover the law as plain matter of fact. It is however unclear as to whether Joseph Raz, an avowed hard positivist, can be classified as conventionalist as Raz has claimed that law is composed \"exclusively\" of social facts which could be complex, and thus difficult to be discovered.\n\nIn particular, Dworkin has characterized law as having the main function of restraining state's coercion. Nigel Simmonds has rejected Dworkin's disapproval of conventionalism, claiming that his characterization of law is too narrow.\n\n"}
{"id": "9160", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9160", "title": "De jure", "text": "De jure\n\nIn law and government, de jure (; ) describes practices that are legally recognised, whether or not the practice exist in reality. In contrast, (\"in fact\" or \"in practice\") describes situations that exist in reality, even if not legally recognised. The terms are often used to contrast different scenarios: for a colloquial example, \"I know that, de jure, this is supposed to be a parking lot, but now that the flood has left four feet of water here, it's a de facto swimming pool\". To further explain, even if the signs around the flooded parking lot say \"Parking Lot\" (the signs effectively being the \"law\" determining what it is) it is \"in fact\" a swimming pool (with the water, the current practical circumstances, determining what it is).\n\nIt is possible to have multiple simultaneous conflicting (\"de jure\") legalities, possibly none of which is in force (\"de facto\"). After seizing power in 1526, Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi made his brother, Umar Din, the lawful (\"de jure\") Sultan of Adal. Ahmad, however, was in practice (\"de facto\") the actual Sultan, and his brother was a figurehead. Between 1805 and 1914, the ruling dynasty of Egypt ruled as \"de jure\" viceroys of the Ottoman Empire, but acted as \"de facto\" independent rulers who maintained a polite fiction of Ottoman suzerainty. However, from about 1882, the rulers had only \"de jure\" rule over Egypt, as it had by then become a British puppet state. Thus, Egypt was by Ottoman law \"de jure\" a province of the Ottoman Empire, but \"de facto\" was part of the British Empire.\n\nIn American law, particularly after \"Brown v. Board of Education\" (1954), the difference between \"de facto\" segregation (segregation that existed because of the voluntary associations and neighborhoods) and \"de jure\" segregation (segregation that existed because of local laws that mandated the segregation) became important distinctions for court-mandated remedial purposes.\n\n"}

This fund was the inspiration for the formation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). After the FDIC was created, the state fund was modified to cover all amounts not covered by the FDIC. Typically the FDIC covers the first $250,000; the Massachusetts fund will cover any amount above that.

The term \"valtiopäivät\" today means an annual session of the Parliament of Finland, the Swedish \"Riksdagen\" being the name for both the Parliament and its sessions.\n\nThe first States of Finland were held in Helsinki in 1616. Other assemblies \"(Åbo lantdag)\" where held in Turku for example in 1676. The assembly was called together by Axel Julius De la Gardie. The estate of peasants was chaired by Heikki Heikinpoika Vaanila.\n\nDuring the Finnish War between Sweden and Russia, the four Estates of occupied Finland (\"Nobility, Clergy, Bourgeoisie and Peasants\") were assembled at Porvoo \"(Borgå)\" by Tsar Alexander I, the new Grand Duke of Finland, between 25 March and 19 July 1809. The central event at Porvoo was the sovereign pledge and the oaths of the Estates in Porvoo Cathedral on 29 March. Each of the Estates swore their oaths of allegiance, committing themselves to accepting the Emperor and Grand Duke of Finland as the true authority, and to keeping the constitution and the form of government unchanged. Alexander I subsequently promised to govern Finland in accordance with its laws. This was thought to essentially mean that the emperor confirmed the Swedish Instrument of Government from 1772 as the constitution of Finland, although it was also interpreted to mean respecting the existing codes and statutes. The diet had required that it would be convened again after the Finnish War, which separated Finland from Sweden, had been concluded. On 17 September that year, the conflict was settled by the Treaty of Fredrikshamn, but it would be another five decades until the Finnish Estates would be called again.\n\nNot until June 1863, after the Crimean War had taken place, did Alexander II call the Estates again. On 18 September the opening ceremony was held and the Emperor made his declaration where he promised to introduce changes to the constitution. The changes included making the diet a regularly convening body, a promise which was kept by the Emperor when the diet convened again in January 1867, where it established an act on the working order of the diet. The diet was to convene at least every fifth year but in practice it would come to convene every third year. The act on Freedom of the Press was seen to have been rejected by the diet in 1867, and as a consequence censorship was introduced. The diets of the 1860s created a working and regularly convening Finnish parliament, but it also spelled an end to further promised constitutional reforms. \n\nIn the elections for the diet of 1872, members of the two language-based parties, the Fennomans and Svecomans, gained more ground at the expense of the liberals. After the assassination of Alexander II the special position of Finland in the Russian empire was in danger. Alexander III announced that the Finnish monetary, customs and postal systems were to be incorporated into their imperial counterparts. At the diet of 1882 the Governor-General gave the Emperors announcement that the diet would have the right to submit bills, but he would be the only one to initiate changes regarding the constitution and military issues.\n\nIn 1899 Grand Duke Nicholas II signed what came to be known as the February Manifesto. The powers of the diet regarding Finland's internal affairs were weakened and transferred to the Russian ministers. The legal committee of the diet of 1899 adopted the opinion that the manifesto was not legally valid in Finland.\n\nThe unrest during the Russo-Japanese War resulted in a general strike in Finland in October 1905. The most immediate result was the Emperor's manifesto that cancelled all illegal regulations. A parliament based on universal and equal suffrage was also promised. An extraordinary session of the diet in December 1905 was called to implement the parliamentary reforms. The proposal was presented to the Emperor on 15 March 1906 and after his approval it was submitted to the estates on 9 May. The reforms came to force on 1 October 1906. The diet was reformed from a legislative assembly of four Estates into a unicameral parliament of 200 members. At the same time universal suffrage was introduced, which gave all men and women, 24 years or older, the right to vote and stand for election. Acts on the right of parliament to monitor members of the government, on the Freedom of Speech, Assembly and Association, and Freedom of the Press were also introduced. These reforms established the hallmarks of today's Parliament of Finland. The first election to the new parliament was arranged in 1907.\n\nFrom 1869 to 1906 the Diet of Finland was composed as follows:\n\nAll chambers debated separately. Ordinarily there were no joint sessions, and while it was possible to arrange a joint debating session where voting was however not permitted, such sessions were only arranged twice in the history of the Diet. Three chambers had to pass the bill before it could be approved by the Emperor. However, consensus was sought in joint committees, and in case of disagreements, a committee was set to reconcile the differences between the versions passed by different chambers. Any bill affecting the privileges of an estate could be passed only with the consent of that estate. All four chambers had to agree in order to modify constitutional laws.\n\nList of sessions of the Finnish diet.\n\n\nThe Diet of Finland, and the four estates of which it was composed, met in a number of different locations during its existence. In the 1860s, all the estates met in the Finnish House of Nobility. Whilst the Nobility of Finland continued to meet there until 1906, the three commoner estates later met in other locations, such as in 1888, when they met in the new building of the Ateneum Art Museum. From 1891 until the parliamentary reform of 1906 the three commoner estates of Clergy, Bourgeoisie and Peasants met in the newly built House of the Estates (Finnish \"Säätytalo\", Swedish \"Ständerhuset\"). However, the meeting rooms of the house were too small for the 200-member unicameral parliament. The house has since seen sporadic use by the state and regular use by scientific and scholarly organizations.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5309710", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5309710", "title": "Energy Northwest", "text": "Energy Northwest\n\nEnergy Northwest (formerly Washington Public Power Supply System) is a public power joint operating agency in the northwest United States, formed in 1957 by Washington state law to produce at-cost power for Northwest utilities. Headquartered in the Tri-Cities at Richland, Washington, the WPPSS became commonly (and derisively) known as due to over-commitment to nuclear power in the 1970s which brought about financial collapse and the second largest municipal bond default in U.S. WPPSS was renamed Energy Northwest in November 1998, and agency membership includes 28 public power utilities, including 23 of the state’s 24 public utility districts.\n\nEnergy Northwest is governed by two boards: an executive board and a board of directors. The executive board has 11 members: five representatives from the board of directors, three gubernatorial appointees and three public representatives selected by the board of directors. The board of directors includes a representative from each member utility.\n\nThe consortium’s nuclear, hydro, wind, and solar projects deliver nearly 1,300 megawatts of electricity to the Northwest power grid. Current power projects include White Bluffs Solar Station, Packwood Lake Hydroelectric Project, Nine Canyon Wind Project, and Columbia Generating Station nuclear power plant.\n\nEnergy Northwest functions as a municipal corporation, similar to a town or city. That legal status allows the agency to issue public bonds to raise the financial capital necessary to build additional power generating and other public utility facilities.\n\nNew power generating facilities currently under consideration include additional wind power sites throughout Washington; a 320-megawatt natural gas plant in Kalama and a carbonless energy park in eastern Washington, as well as three solar projects in Oregon at 5-megawatts each. The agency also provides a variety of business services in the energy, power generation and technical fields, including a range of project management and facility operations and maintenance services.\n\nIn April 2006, Energy Northwest achieved ISO 14001:2004 registration, formalizing its environment stewardship program.\n\nThe public power movement gained prominence in the 1920s and 1930s under the leadership of the Washington State Grange, a non-partisan, grassroots advocacy group for rural citizens with both legislative programs and community activities. Public utility districts were created to provide reliable, low-cost power for the growing state.\n\nOn Jan. 31, 1957, the state legislature created the Washington Public Power Supply System, now known as Energy Northwest, as a joint operating agency to share the risks and rewards of building and operating electrical generating facilities. The power was to be provided, at the cost of production, to the ratepayers of those public utilities participating in the agency’s new projects.\n\nThe first generating source to be developed was the Packwood Lake Hydroelectric Project, located in Lewis County, Washington State approximately 20 miles south of Mount Rainier. The 27.5 megawatt project was designed to produce electricity while protecting the natural environment. Packwood continues to produce power into its fifth decade of operation. In February 2008, Energy Northwest submitted an application to renew the project’s operating license for an additional 50 years to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The agency expects to receive a license renewal for the project in 2010.\n\nIn September 1962, Congress passed and President John F. Kennedy signed a bill authorizing construction of a new dual-purpose nuclear reactor (the N Reactor) on the Hanford nuclear reservation. It was designed to produce both weapons-grade plutonium and steam to power turbine generators – thus its designation as a dual-purpose reactor. With support from U.S. Senator Henry \"Scoop\" Jackson, the agency made a successful pitch to be the non-federal operator of the steam generator half of the project. President Kennedy presided over the groundbreaking in September 1963. Commercial operation of the 860-megawatt Hanford Generating Project began in April 1966.\n\nFor the agency, under the regionally developed Hydro-Thermal Power Program, the 1970s brought the challenge of attempting to simultaneously construct multiple nuclear power plants. Over-commitment to nuclear power brought about the financial collapse of the Washington Public Power Supply System, which undertook to build five large nuclear power plants in the 1970s. Other groups, including the city of Seattle, questioned the feasibility of the project. In July 1976, the Seattle City Council voted against participating in the building of the project 4 and 5 nuclear power plants based, citing a 12-volume study that recommended a program of conservation and alternative energy sources instead of participation in the nuclear plants.\n\nManaging director Neil Strand resigned in February 1980, after being under fire for several months due to the cost overruns and construction delays at the five nuclear power plants. He had been in the lead position for nearly three years.\n\nIn January 1982, cost overruns and delays, along with a slowing of electricity demand growth, led to cancellation of two WPPSS plants and a construction halt on the two-reactor Satsop Nuclear Power Plant which was 75% complete. Eighteen months later in July 1983, WPPSS defaulted on $2.25 billion of municipal bonds, which is the second largest municipal bond default in U.S. history. The court case that followed took nearly a decade to resolve, and WPPSS acquired the unfortunate nickname \"Whoops\" in \n\nFuel loading at Columbia Generating Station began on Dec. 25, 1983, and proceeded at a rate of 50 fuel assemblies per day. The process was completed Jan. 12, 1984, and Columbia was declared in commercial operation Dec. 13, 1984. On Jan 19, 2010, Energy Northwest submitted an application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a 20-year license renewal of Columbia Generating Station. The current license will expire near the end of 2023.

{"id": "45710", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45710", "title": "Forensic science", "text": "Forensic science\n\nForensic science is the application of science to criminal and civil laws, mainly—on the criminal side—during criminal investigation, as governed by the legal standards of admissible evidence and criminal procedure.\n\nForensic scientists collect, preserve, and analyze scientific evidence during the course of an investigation. While some forensic scientists travel to the scene of the crime to collect the evidence themselves, others occupy a laboratory role, performing analysis on objects brought to them by other individuals.\n\nIn addition to their laboratory role, forensic scientists testify as expert witnesses in both criminal and civil cases and can work for either the prosecution or the defense. While any field could technically be \"forensic\", certain sections have developed over time to encompass the majority of forensically related cases.\nForensic science is the combination of two different Latin words: forensis and science. The former, forensic, relates to a discussion or examination performed in public. Because trials in the ancient world were typically held in public, it carries a strong judicial connotation. The second is science, which is derived from the Latin word for knowledge and is today closely tied to the scientific method, a systematic way of acquiring knowledge. Taken together, then, forensic science can be seen as the use of the scientific methods and processes in crime solving.\n\nThe word \"forensic\" comes from the Latin term \"forensis\", meaning \"of or before the forum\". The history of the term originates from Roman times, during which a criminal charge meant presenting the case before a group of public individuals in the forum. Both the person accused of the crime and the accuser would give speeches based on their sides of the story. The case would be decided in favor of the individual with the best argument and delivery. This origin is the source of the two modern usages of the word \"forensic\" – as a form of legal evidence and as a category of public presentation. In modern use, the term \"forensics\" in the place of \"forensic science\" can be considered correct, as the term \"forensic\" is effectively a synonym for \"legal\" or \"related to courts\". However, the term is now so closely associated with the scientific field that many dictionaries include the meaning that equates the word \"forensics\" with \"forensic science\".\n\nThe ancient world lacked standardized forensic practices, which aided criminals in escaping punishment. Criminal investigations and trials heavily relied on forced confessions and witness testimony. However, ancient sources do contain several accounts of techniques that foreshadow concepts in forensic science that were developed centuries later.\n\nThe first written account of using medicine and entomology to solve criminal cases is attributed to the book of \"Xi Yuan Lu\" (translated as \"Washing Away of Wrongs\"), written in China by Song Ci (宋慈, 1186–1249) in 1248, who was a director of justice, jail and supervision, during the Song dynasty.\n\nSong Ci ruled regulation about autopsy report for court, how to protect the evidence in the examining process, the reason why workers must show examination to public impartiality. He concluded methods on how to make antiseptic and to reappear the hidden injury from dead bodies and bones (using sunlight under red-oil umbrella and vinegar); how to calculate the death time (according to weather and insects); how to wash dead body for examining the different reasons of death. At that time, the book had given methods to distinguish suicide or pretending suicide.\n\nIn one of Song Ci's accounts (\"Washing Away of Wrongs\"), the case of a person murdered with a sickle was solved by an investigator who instructed everyone to bring his sickle to one location. (He realized it was a sickle by testing various blades on an animal carcass and comparing the wound.) Flies, attracted by the smell of blood, eventually gathered on a single sickle. In light of this, the murderer confessed. For example, the book also described how to distinguish between a drowning (water in the lungs) and strangulation (broken neck cartilage), along with other evidence from examining corpses on determining if a death was caused by murder, suicide or an accident.\n\nMethods from around the world involved saliva and examination of the mouth and tongue to determine innocence or guilt, as a precursor to the Polygraph test. In ancient India, some suspects were made to fill their mouths with dried rice and spit it back out. Similarly, in ancient China, those accused of a crime would have rice powder placed in their mouths. In ancient middle-eastern cultures, the accused were made to lick hot metal rods briefly. It is thought that these tests had some validity since a guilty person would produce less saliva and thus have a drier mouth; the accused would be considered guilty if rice was sticking to their mouths in abundance or if their tongues were severely burned due to lack of shielding from saliva.\n\nIn 16th-century Europe, medical practitioners in army and university settings began to gather information on the cause and manner of death. Ambroise Paré, a French army surgeon, systematically studied the effects of violent death on internal organs. Two Italian surgeons, Fortunato Fidelis and Paolo Zacchia, laid the foundation of modern pathology by studying changes that occurred in the structure of the body as the result of disease. In the late 18th century, writings on these topics began to appear. These included \"A Treatise on Forensic Medicine and Public Health\" by the French physician Francois Immanuele Fodéré and \"The Complete System of Police Medicine\" by the German medical expert Johann Peter Frank.\n\nAs the rational values of the Enlightenment era increasingly permeated society in the 18th century, criminal investigation became a more evidence-based, rational procedure − the use of torture to force confessions was curtailed, and belief in witchcraft and other powers of the occult largely ceased to influence the court's decisions. Two examples of English forensic science in individual legal proceedings demonstrate the increasing use of logic and procedure in criminal investigations at the time. In 1784, in Lancaster, John Toms was tried and convicted for murdering Edward Culshaw with a pistol. When the dead body of Culshaw was examined, a pistol wad (crushed paper used to secure powder and balls in the muzzle) found in his head wound matched perfectly with a torn newspaper found in Toms's pocket, leading to the conviction.\n\nIn Warwick 1816, a farm laborer was tried and convicted of the murder of a young maidservant. She had been drowned in a shallow pool and bore the marks of violent assault. The police found footprints and an impression from corduroy cloth with a sewn patch in the damp earth near the pool. There were also scattered grains of wheat and chaff. The breeches of a farm labourer who had been threshing wheat nearby were examined and corresponded exactly to the impression in the earth near the pool.\n\nA method for detecting arsenious oxide, simple arsenic, in corpses was devised in 1773 by the Swedish chemist, Carl Wilhelm Scheele. His work was expanded, in 1806, by German chemist Valentin Ross, who learned to detect the poison in the walls of a victim's stomach.\nJames Marsh was the first to apply this new science to the art of forensics. He was called by the prosecution in a murder trial to give evidence as a chemist in 1832. The defendant, John Bodle, was accused of poisoning his grandfather with arsenic-laced coffee. Marsh performed the standard test by mixing a suspected sample with hydrogen sulfide and hydrochloric acid. While he was able to detect arsenic as yellow arsenic trisulfide, when it was shown to the jury it had deteriorated, allowing the suspect to be acquitted due to reasonable doubt.\n\nAnnoyed by that, Marsh developed a much better test. He combined a sample containing arsenic with sulfuric acid and arsenic-free zinc, resulting in arsine gas. The gas was ignited, and it decomposed to pure metallic arsenic, which, when passed to a cold surface, would appear as a silvery-black deposit. So sensitive was the test, known formally as the Marsh test, that it could detect as little as one-fiftieth of a milligram of arsenic. He first described this test in \"The Edinburgh Philosophical Journal\" in 1836.\n\nHenry Goddard at Scotland Yard pioneered the use of bullet comparison in 1835. He noticed a flaw in the bullet that killed the victim and was able to trace this back to the mold that was used in the manufacturing process.\n\nThe French police officer Alphonse Bertillon was the first to apply the anthropological technique of anthropometry to law enforcement, thereby creating an identification system based on physical measurements. Before that time, criminals could only be identified by name or photograph. Dissatisfied with the \"ad hoc\" methods used to identify captured criminals in France in the 1870s, he began his work on developing a reliable system of anthropometrics for human classification.\n\nBertillon created many other forensics techniques, including forensic document examination, the use of galvanoplastic compounds to preserve footprints, ballistics, and the dynamometer, used to determine the degree of force used in breaking and entering. Although his central methods were soon to be supplanted by fingerprinting, \"his other contributions like the mug shot and the systematization of crime-scene photography remain in place to this day.\"\n\nSir William Herschel was one of the first to advocate the use of fingerprinting in the identification of criminal suspects. While working for the Indian Civil Service, he began to use thumbprints on documents as a security measure to prevent the then-rampant repudiation of signatures in 1858.\nIn 1877 at Hooghly (near Kolkata), Herschel instituted the use of fingerprints on contracts and deeds, and he registered government pensioners' fingerprints to prevent the collection of money by relatives after a pensioner's death.\n\nIn 1880, Dr. Henry Faulds, a Scottish surgeon in a Tokyo hospital, published his first paper on the subject in the scientific journal \"Nature\", discussing the usefulness of fingerprints for identification and proposing a method to record them with printing ink. He established their first classification and was also the first to identify fingerprints left on a vial. Returning to the UK in 1886, he offered the concept to the Metropolitan Police in London, but it was dismissed at that time.\n\nFaulds wrote to Charles Darwin with a description of his method, but, too old and ill to work on it, Darwin gave the information to his cousin, Francis Galton, who was interested in anthropology. Having been thus inspired to study fingerprints for ten years, Galton published a detailed statistical model of fingerprint analysis and identification and encouraged its use in forensic science in his book \"Finger Prints\". He had calculated that the chance of a \"false positive\" (two different individuals having the same fingerprints) was about 1 in 64 billion.\nJuan Vucetich, an Argentine chief police officer, created the first method of recording the fingerprints of individuals on file. In 1892, after studying Galton's pattern types, Vucetich set up the world's first fingerprint bureau. In that same year, Francisca Rojas of Necochea was found in a house with neck injuries whilst her two sons were found dead with their throats cut. Rojas accused a neighbour, but despite brutal interrogation, this neighbour would not confess to the crimes. Inspector Alvarez, a colleague of Vucetich, went to the scene and found a bloody thumb mark on a door. When it was compared with Rojas' prints, it was found to be identical with her right thumb. She then confessed to the murder of her sons.\n\nA Fingerprint Bureau was established in Calcutta (Kolkata), India, in 1897, after the Council of the Governor General approved a committee report that fingerprints should be used for the classification of criminal records. Working in the Calcutta Anthropometric Bureau, before it became the Fingerprint Bureau, were Azizul Haque and Hem Chandra Bose. Haque and Bose were Indian fingerprint experts who have been credited with the primary development of a fingerprint classification system eventually named after their supervisor, Sir Edward Richard Henry. The Henry Classification System, co-devised by Haque and Bose, was accepted in England and Wales when the first United Kingdom Fingerprint Bureau was founded in Scotland Yard, the Metropolitan Police headquarters, London, in 1901. Sir Edward Richard Henry subsequently achieved improvements in dactyloscopy.\n\nIn the United States, Dr. Henry P. DeForrest used fingerprinting in the New York Civil Service in 1902, and by December 1905, New York City Police Department Deputy Commissioner Joseph A. Faurot, an expert in the Bertillon system and a fingerprint advocate at Police Headquarters, introduced the fingerprinting of criminals to the United States.\n\nThe Uhlenhuth test, or the antigen–antibody precipitin test for species, was invented by Paul Uhlenhuth in 1901 and could distinguish human blood from animal blood, based on the discovery that the blood of different species had one or more characteristic proteins. The test represented a major breakthrough and came to have tremendous importance in forensic science. The test was further refined for forensic use by the Swiss chemist Maurice Müller in the 1960s.\n\nForensic DNA analysis was first used in 1984. It was developed by Sir Alec Jeffreys, who realized that variation in the genetic code could be used to identify individuals and to tell individuals apart from one another. The first application of DNA profiles was used by Jefferys in a double murder mystery in the small English town of Narborough, Leicestershire in 1985. A 15-year-old school girl by the name of Lynda Mann was raped and murdered in Carlton Hayes psychiatric hospital. The police did not find a suspect but were able to obtain a semen sample.\n\nIn 1986, Dawn Ashworth, 15 years old, was also raped and strangled in a nearby village of Enderby. Forensic evidence showed that both killers had the same blood type. Richard Buckland became the suspect because he worked at Carlton Hayes psychiatric hospital, had been spotted near Dawn Ashworth's murder scene and knew unreleased details about the body. He later confessed to Dawn's murder but not Lynda's. Jefferys was brought into the case to analyze the semen samples. He concluded that there was no match between the samples and Buckland, who became the first person to be exonerated using DNA. Jefferys confirmed that the DNA profiles were identical for the two murder semen samples. To find the perpetrator, DNA samples from the entire male population, more than 4,000 aged from 17 to 34, of the town were collected. They all were compared to semen samples from the crime. A friend of Colin Pitchfork was heard saying that he had given his sample to the police claiming to be Colin. Colin Pitchfork was arrested in 1987 and it was found that his DNA profile matched the semen samples from the murder.\n\nBecause of this case, DNA databases were developed. There is the national (FBI) and international databases as well as the European countries (ENFSI : European Network of Forensic Science Institutes). These searchable databases are used to match crime scene DNA profiles to those already in a database.\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, the science of forensics had become largely established in the sphere of criminal investigation. Scientific and surgical investigation was widely employed by the Metropolitan Police during their pursuit of the mysterious Jack the Ripper, who had killed a number of prostitutes in the 1880s. This case is a watershed in the application of forensic science. Large teams of policemen conducted house-to-house inquiries throughout Whitechapel. Forensic material was collected and examined. Suspects were identified, traced and either examined more closely or eliminated from the inquiry. Police work follows the same pattern today. Over 2000 people were interviewed, \"upwards of 300\" people were investigated, and 80 people were detained.\n\nThe investigation was initially conducted by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), headed by Detective Inspector Edmund Reid. Later, Detective Inspectors Frederick Abberline, Henry Moore, and Walter Andrews were sent from Central Office at Scotland Yard to assist. Initially, butchers, surgeons and physicians were suspected because of the manner of the mutilations. The alibis of local butchers and slaughterers were investigated, with the result that they were eliminated from the inquiry. Some contemporary figures thought the pattern of the murders indicated that the culprit was a butcher or cattle drover on one of the cattle boats that plied between London and mainland Europe. Whitechapel was close to the London Docks, and usually such boats docked on Thursday or Friday and departed on Saturday or Sunday. The cattle boats were examined, but the dates of the murders did not coincide with a single boat's movements, and the transfer of a crewman between boats was also ruled out.\n\nAt the end of October, Robert Anderson asked police surgeon Thomas Bond to give his opinion on the extent of the murderer's surgical skill and knowledge. The opinion offered by Bond on the character of the \"Whitechapel murderer\" is the earliest surviving offender profile. Bond's assessment was based on his own examination of the most extensively mutilated victim and the post mortem notes from the four previous canonical murders. In his opinion the killer must have been a man of solitary habits, subject to \"periodical attacks of homicidal and erotic mania\", with the character of the mutilations possibly indicating \"satyriasis\". Bond also stated that \"the homicidal impulse may have developed from a revengeful or brooding condition of the mind, or that religious mania may have been the original disease but I do not think either hypothesis is likely\".\n\"Handbook for Coroners, police officials, military policemen\" was written by the Austrian criminal jurist Hans Gross in 1893, and is generally acknowledged as the birth of the field of criminalistics. The work combined in one system fields of knowledge that had not been previously integrated, such as psychology and physical science, and which could be successfully used against crime. Gross adapted some fields to the needs of criminal investigation, such as crime scene photography. He went on to found the Institute of Criminalistics in 1912, as part of the University of Graz' Law School. This Institute was followed by many similar institutes all over the world.\n\nIn 1909, Archibald Reiss founded the \"Institut de police scientifique\" of the University of Lausanne (UNIL), the first school of forensic science in the world. Dr. Edmond Locard, became known as the \"Sherlock Holmes of France\". He formulated the basic principle of forensic science: \"Every contact leaves a trace\", which became known as Locard's exchange principle. In 1910, he founded what may have been the first criminal laboratory in the world, after persuading the Police Department of Lyon (France) to give him two attic rooms and two assistants.\n\nSymbolic of the new found prestige of forensics and the use of reasoning in detective work was the popularity of the fictional character Sherlock Holmes, written by Arthur Conan Doyle in the late 19th century. He remains a great inspiration for forensic science, especially for the way his acute study of a crime scene yielded small clues as to the precise sequence of events. He made great use of trace evidence such as shoe and tire impressions, as well as fingerprints, ballistics and handwriting analysis, now known as questioned document examination. Such evidence is used to test theories conceived by the police, for example, or by the investigator himself. All of the techniques advocated by Holmes later became reality, but were generally in their infancy at the time Conan Doyle was writing. In many of his reported cases, Holmes frequently complains of the way the crime scene has been contaminated by others, especially by the police, emphasising the critical importance of maintaining its integrity, a now well-known feature of crime scene examination. He used analytical chemistry for blood residue analysis as well as toxicology examination and determination for poisons. He used ballistics by measuring bullet calibres and matching them with a suspected murder weapon.\n\nHans Gross applied scientific methods to crime scenes and was responsible for the birth of criminalistics.\n\nEdmund Locard expanded on Gross' work with Locard's Exchange Principle which stated \"whenever two objects come into contact with one another, materials are exchanged between them\". This means that every contact by a criminal leaves a trace. Locard was also known as the \"Sherlock Holmes of France\".\n\nAlexander Lacassagne, who taught Locard, produced autopsy standards on actual forensic cases.\n\nAlphonse Bertillon was a French criminologist and founder of Anthropometry (scientific study of measurements and proportions of the human body). He used anthropometry for identification, saying each individual is unique and by measuring aspect of physical difference, there could be a personal identification system. He created the Bertillon System around 1879, which was a way to identify criminals and citizens by measuring 20 parts of the body. In 1884, there was over 240 repeat offenders caught through the Bertillon system. Fingerprinting became more reliable than the Bertillon system.\n\nFrances Glessner Lee, known as \"the mother of forensic science,\" was instrumental in the development of forensic science in the US. She lobbied to have coroners replaced by medical professionals, endowed the Harvard Associates in Police Science, and conducted many seminars to educate homicide investigators. She also created the Nutshell Studies of Unexplained Death, intricate crime scene dioramas used to train investigators. They are still in use today.\n\nLater in the 20th century several British pathologists, Mikey Rochman, Francis Camps, Sydney Smith and Keith Simpson pioneered new forensic science methods. Alec Jeffreys pioneered the use of DNA profiling in forensic science in 1984. He realized the scope of DNA fingerprinting, which uses variations in the genetic code to identify individuals. The method has since become important in forensic science to assist police detective work, and it has also proved useful in resolving paternity and immigration disputes. DNA fingerprinting was first used as a police forensic test to identify the rapist and killer of two teenagers, Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth, who were both murdered in Narborough, Leicestershire, in 1983 and 1986 respectively. Colin Pitchfork was identified and convicted of murder after samples taken from him matched semen samples taken from the two dead girls.\n\nForensic science has been fostered by a number of national forensic science learned bodies including the Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences, (founded in 1959), then known as the Forensic Science Society, publisher of \"Science & Justice\";. American Academy of Forensic Sciences (founded 1948), publishers of the \"Journal of Forensic Sciences\"; the Canadian Society of Forensic Science (founded 1953), publishers of the \"Journal of the Canadian Society of Forensic Science\"; the British Academy of Forensic Sciences (founded 1960), publishers of \"Medicine, Science and the Law\", and the Australian Academy of Forensic Sciences (founded 1967), publishers of the \"Australian Journal of Forensic Sciences\".\n\nIn the past decade, documenting forensics scenes has become more efficient. People started using laser scanners, drones and photogrammetry to obtain 3D point clouds of accidents or crime scenes. Reconstruction of an accident scene on a highway using drones involves data acquisition time of only 10–20 minutes and can be performed without shutting down traffic.The results are not just accurate, in centimeters, for measurement to be presented in court but also easy to digitally preserve in the long term.\n\n\nSome forensic techniques, believed to be scientifically sound at the time they were used, have turned out later to have much less scientific merit or none. Some such techniques include:\n\nLitigation science describes analysis or data developed or produced \"expressly\" for use in a trial versus those produced in the course of independent research. This distinction was made by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals when evaluating the admissibility of experts.\n\nThis uses demonstrative evidence, which is evidence created in preparation of trial by attorneys or paralegals.\n\nIn the United States there are over 14,500 forensic science technicians, as of 2014.\n\nReal-life crime scene investigators and forensic scientists warn that popular television shows do not give a realistic picture of the work and often wildlly distorting the nature of the work, and exaggerating the ease, speed, effectiveness, drama, glamour, influence and comfort level of their jobs—which they describe as far more mundane, tedious and boring.\n\nSome claim these modern TV shows have changed individuals' expectations of forensic science, sometimes unrealistically—an influence termed the \"CSI effect\".\n\nFurther, research has suggested that public misperceptions about criminal forensics can create, in the mind of a juror, unrealistic expectations of forensic evidence—which they expect to see before convicting—implicitly biasing the juror towards the defendant. Citing the \"CSI Effect,\" at least one researcher has suggested screening jurors for their level of influence from such TV programs\n\nQuestions about certain areas of forensic science, such as fingerprint evidence and the assumptions behind these disciplines have been brought to light in some publications including the \"New York Post\". The article stated that \"No one has proved even the basic assumption: That everyone's fingerprint is unique.\" The article also stated that \"Now such assumptions are being questioned – and with it may come a radical change in how forensic science is used by police departments and prosecutors.\" Law professor Jessica Gabel said on NOVA that forensic science \"lacks the rigors, the standards, the quality controls and procedures that we find, usually, in science.\"\n\nIn America, on 25 June 2009, the Supreme Court issued a 5-to-4 decision in \"Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts\" stating that crime laboratory reports may not be used against criminal defendants at trial unless the analysts responsible for creating them give testimony and subject themselves to cross-examination. The Supreme Court cited the National Academies report \"Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States\" in their decision. Writing for the majority, Justice Antonin Scalia referred to the National Research Council report in his assertion that \"Forensic evidence is not uniquely immune from the risk of manipulation.\"\n\nIn 2009, scientists indicated that it is possible to fabricate DNA evidence, therefore suggesting it is possible to falsely accuse or acquit a person or persons using forged evidence.\n\nIn America, another area of forensic science that has come under question in recent years is the lack of laws requiring the accreditation of forensic labs. Some states require accreditation, but some states do not. Because of this, many labs have been caught performing very poor work resulting in false convictions or acquittals. For example, it was discovered after an audit of the Houston Police Department in 2002 that the lab had fabricated evidence which led George Rodriguez being convicted of raping a fourteen-year-old girl. The former director of the lab, when asked, said that the total number of cases that could have been contaminated by improper work could be in the range of 5,000 to 10,000. This could have been avoided if the lab had been accredited by organizations such as ASCLD/Lab, which require crime labs to undergo rigorous assessments to show that they are able to perform multiple tests accurately. Once they become accredited, they are periodically re-evaluated to ensure that the lab is still functioning at its best. Periodic evaluations of a lab's performance by an independent organization will help to prevent scandals from occurring in forensic science laboratories.\n\nAlthough forensic science has greatly enhanced the investigator's ability to solve crimes, it has limitations and must be scrutinized in and out of the courtroom to avoid the occurrence of wrongful convictions.\n\nMany studies have discovered a difference in rape related injury reporting based on race, with white victims reporting a higher frequency of injuries than black victims. However, since current forensic examination techniques may not be sensitive to all injuries across a range of skin colors, more research needs to be conducted to understand if this trend is due to skin confounding healthcare providers when examining injuries or if darker skin extends a protective element. In clinical practice, for patients with darker skin, one study recommends that attention must be paid to the thighs, labia majora, posterior fourchette and fossa navicularis, so that no rape related injuries are missed upon close examination.\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) uses forensic science for humanitarian purposes to clarify the fate of missing persons after armed conflict, disasters or migration, and is one of the services related to Restoring Family Links and Missing Persons. Knowing what has happened to a missing relative can often make it easier to proceed with the grieving process and move on with life for families of missing persons.\n\nForensic science is used by various other organizations to clarify the fate and whereabouts of persons who have gone missing. Examples include the NGO Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team, working to clarify the fate of people who disappeared during the period of the 1976–1983 military dictatorship. The International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) uses forensic science to find missing persons, for example after the conflicts in the Balkans.\n\nRecognising the role of forensic science for humanitarian purposes, as well as the importance of forensic investigations in fulfilling the state's responsibilities to investigate human rights violations, a group of experts in the late-1980's devised a UN Manual on the Prevention and Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions, which became known as the Minnesota Protocol. This document was revised and re-published by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in 2016.\n\n"}
{"id": "16613521", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16613521", "title": "Goel", "text": "Goel\n\nGoel \"(the Go’el HaDahm)\" is a Hebrew term which comes from the word \"lig'ol\" (\"to redeem\"), hence meaning \"redeemer\", which in the Hebrew Bible and the rabbinical tradition denotes a person who as the nearest relative of another is charged with the duty of restoring the rights of another and avenging his wrongs. When \"goel\" is used in contexts involving revenge for wrongful death, English-language translations of the Bible generally refer to a goel as an \"avenger of blood\".\n\nIn the Book of Isaiah, God is called the redeemer of Israel, as God redeems his people from captivity; the context shows that the redemption also involves moving on to something greater. In Christianity, the title goel is applied to Christ, who redeems his believers from all evil by offering Himself as the Paschal Lamb.\n\n The obligations of the goel include the duty to redeem the relative from slavery, if the latter had been obliged to sell himself into serfdom (Leviticus 25: 48-49); to repurchase the property of a relative who had had to sell it because of poverty; to avenge the blood of his relative; to marry his brother's widow in order to have a son for his brother, in case the brother had not got any son to pass his name forth (Deuteronomy 25:5-6); and to receive the restitution if the injured relative had died (Numbers 5:8).\n\nJewish tradition has also ascribed to the blood avenger role performed in modern times by a prosecuting attorney, who thus pleads on behalf of the victim the case against the criminal. Thus, he is responsible for bringing the offender to court, finding evidence against him, presenting the case to the court, and collecting damages from the offender. It is also his task to argue against any attempts to pardon the sinner. It is presumed that the court would be the party who would avenge the wrongful death via the usage of the death penalty.\n\n"}

The corporation may be a business, a nonprofit organization, sports club, or a government of a new city or town. This article focuses on the process of incorporation; see also Corporation (Corp.).\n\nThe information required differ in different states. However, there are some common information that are asked by almost all the states and so, must be incl. in the Certificate of Inc., accordingly. They are as follows:\n\n\n\n\nAm. opinion of corporations has evolved significantly throughout history, and Supreme Court cases provide a means to observe this evolution. While these cases may seem arbitrary and decontextualized when examined individually, when viewed successively and within historical context, a narrative emerges that offers an explanation for why such views are upheld.\n\n1816 the New Hampshire state legislature passed a bill that would turn privately owned Dartmouth College into a publicly owned university with a Board of Trustees appointed by the governor. The board filed a suit challenging the constitutionality of the legislature. The suit alleged the college enjoyed the right to contract and the government changing that contract was not allowed. Chief Justice John Marshall delivered the majority opinion and affirmed that the right to contract exists between owners of private property rather than between a government and its citizens. The case was the first case in US history that asked fundamental questions about corporate entities and the protections they enjoy; it also was a precedent-setting case in extending \"individual rights\" to corporations.\n\nThe railroad was an expensive multi-year project that greatly changed and altered both the physical and commercial landscape of the country. As with most new technology developments that have a broad impact, there are disputes about how those technologies and the businesses they thrive in fit under the umbrella of laws that govern regulations and taxation. In 1886 one such taxation dispute arose between Santa Clara County and Southern Pacific Railroad. The railroad thought the tax code was misapplied to some of their property and assets. In deciding the case, a unanimous court ruled that governments must abide by the same tax code enforcement for individuals that it did for corporations. While not explicitly stated in the case, it was implied that this case extended equal protection rights to corporations under the 14th amendment.\n\nThe booming economy the railroad corporations helped build from the late 19th into the early 20th centuries came to a screeching halt in 1929. The Great Depression, as it came to be known, helped a view of corporations emerge that put them at odds with the normal working man. The election of Franklin D. Roosevelt was a manifestation of many populist sentiments the country might have felt. In 1933 a Florida case came before the court, again disputing taxation. In \"Liggett v. Lee\" the court ruled that there could be a corporate tax, essentially saying the structure of business was a justifiably discriminatory criterion for governments to consider when writing tax legislation. This was a unique ruling handed down during a unique time in US history that denied a corporation freedom it sought in the courtroom.\n\nFrom 1940 to 1990 the percent of total GDP made up by financial service professionals increased by 300%. Along with that growth there was a growth in the profits this industry experienced as well. As the disposable income of banks and other financial institutions rose, they sought a way to use it to influence politics and policy. In response, Massachusetts passed a law limiting corporate donations strictly to issues related to their industry. The First National Bank of Boston challenged the law on First Amendment grounds and won. \"First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti\" allowed business to use financial speech in political causes of any nature.\n\nIn 2010 amidst an outpouring of frustration and blame directed at Wall Street the issue of corporate contributions came before the court again. In \"Citizens United v. FEC\" the court said there was virtually no distinction between monetary contributions and political speech, and because we do not limit political speech unless it is tantamount to bribery, corporations have the right as people to donate unlimited amounts of money to any political cause so long as it is not to a direct campaign.\n\nThe articles of incorporation (also called a charter, certificate of incorporation or letters patent) are filed with the appropriate state office, listing the purpose of the corporation, its principal place of business and the number and type of shares of stock. A registration fee is due, which is usually between $25 and $1,000, depending on the state.\n\nA corporate name is generally made up of three parts: \"distinctive element\", \"descriptive element\", and a legal ending. All corporations must have a distinctive element, and in most filing jurisdictions, a legal ending to their names. Some corporations choose not to have a descriptive element. In the name \"Tiger Computers, Inc.\", the word \"Tiger\" is the distinctive element; the word \"Computers\" is the descriptive element; and the \"Inc.\" is the legal ending. The legal ending indicates that it is in fact a legal corporation and not just a business registration or partnership. Incorporated, limited, and corporation, or their respective abbreviations (Inc., Ltd., Corp.) are the possible legal endings in the US.\n\nUsually, there are also corporate bylaws which must be filed with the state. Bylaws outline a number of important administrative details such as when annual shareholder meetings will be held, who can vote and the manner in which shareholders will be notified if there is need for an additional \"special\" meeting.\n\nCorporations can only deduct net operating losses going back two years and forward 20 years.\n\nAssuming a corporation has not sold stock to the public, conducting corporate business is straightforward. Often, it amounts to recording key corporate decisions (for example, borrowing money or buying real estate) and holding an annual meeting. These formalities can often be supplanted by written agreement and do not usually need a face-to-face meeting.\n\nIn the UK, the process of incorporation is generally called company formation. The United Kingdom is one of the quickest locations to incorporate, with a fully electronic process and a very fast turnaround by the national registrar of companies, the Companies House. The current Companies House record is five minutes to vet and issue a certificate of incorporation for an electronic application.\n\nThere are many different types of UK companies:\n\n\nThe legal concept of incorporation is recognized all over the world.\n\n\n\n"}

Under the common law, if no such persons exist, the property passes to the nearest living person who can demonstrate some degree of kinship with the deceased, no matter how distant the relation.\n\nSome jurisdictions have a laughing heir statute, which cuts off the right of inheritance when the remaining relatives become too remote. In such jurisdictions, if no relative falls within the limitation set by the statute, then the property escheats to the state. §2-103 of the Uniform Probate Code, which has been adopted by a number of states, sets the outer limits of the right to inheritance with grandparents, aunts and uncles, and first cousins. Under the code, heirs that are farther removed from the deceased are left with no claim to the estate at all.\n\nBy contrast, some US states (such as Virginia) have extended the principle to cover the family of a predeceased \"spouse\". In those states, if the decedent had been married, and their spouse had died before the decedent, and if the decedent had no blood relatives at all, then the decedent's property would pass to any living relatives of the \"spouse\", no matter how remote.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1944555", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1944555", "title": "MACRS", "text": "MACRS\n\nThe Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS) is the current tax depreciation system in the United States. Under this system, the capitalized cost (basis) of tangible property is recovered over a specified life by annual deductions for depreciation. The lives are specified broadly in the Internal Revenue Code. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) publishes detailed tables of lives by classes of assets. The deduction for depreciation is computed under one of two methods (declining balance switching to straight line or straight line) at the election of the taxpayer, with limitations. See IRS Publication 946 for a 120-page guide to MACRS.\n\nTax deductions for depreciation have been allowed in the U.S. since the inception of the income tax. Prior to 1971, these deductions could be computed in a variety of manners over a wide range of lives, under old Bulletin F. In 1971, Congress introduced the Class Life Asset Depreciation Range (ADR) system in an attempt to simplify calculations and provide some uniformity. Under ADR, the IRS prescribed lives for classes of assets based on the nature or use of the asset. Such classes included general classes (such as office equipment) and industry classes (such as assets used in the manufacture of rubber goods). Taxpayers could use their choice of several methods of depreciating assets, including straight line, declining balance, and sum of years digits. Asset costs and accumulated depreciation were tracked by \"vintage accounts\" consisting of all assets within a class acquired in a particular tax year. All vintage accounts for the same year were assumed placed in service in the middle of the year; however, a taxpayer could elect the modified half year convention with potentially favorable results.\n\nIn 1981, Congress again changed the depreciation system, providing generally for shorter lives for recovery of costs. Under the Accelerated Cost Recovery System (ACRS), broad groups of assets were assigned based on the old ADR lives (which the IRS has updated since). Taxpayers were permitted to calculate depreciation only under the declining balance method switching to straight line or the straight line method. Other changes applied as well.\n\nThe present MACRS system was adopted as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.\n\nCalifornia is the only state which does not fully conform its depreciation schedule to MACRS.\n\nUnder MACRS a taxpayer must compute tax deductions for depreciation of tangible property using specified lives and methods. Assets are divided into classes by type of asset or by business in which the asset is used. (See tables of classes below.) Where a general class based on the nature of the asset applies (00.xx classes below), that class takes precedence over the use class.\n\nFor each class, three lives are specified: one for regular depreciation (GDS in the tables below), one for the alternative depreciation system (ADS), and a class life. Taxpayers may be required to use ADS or otherwise may elect which of the three lives to use. Lives for personal property vary from 3 years to 20 years. Land improvements must be depreciated over 15 or 20 years. Other real property must be depreciated over 27.5 years for residential property, 39 years for business property, and 40 years under ADS.\n\nIn addition, shorter lives are provided for certain property, including computers and peripheral equipment, certain high technology equipment, special purpose agricultural structures, and certain other items. MACRS also excluded certain property in regulated industries, as well as films, video tapes, and sound recordings, and certain other items. Also, leasehold improvements to realty are generally treated as real property under MACRS.\n\nOnly the declining balance method and straight line method of computing depreciation are allowed under MACRS. Taxpayers using the declining balance change to the straight line method at the point at which depreciation deductions are optimized. See the tables below. All tangible personal property acquired during the year is considered placed in service in the middle of the tax year (\"half-year convention\"). Real property is considered placed in service in the middle of the month in which acquired (\"mid-month convention\"). Special rules apply for pro rating deductions for short tax years and for the first year of business, or where more than 40% of tangible personal property additions are in the final quarter of the year.\n\nThe method and life used in depreciating an asset is an accounting method, change of which requires IRS approval.\n\nTaxpayers may track the basis and accumulated depreciation of assets individually or in vintage accounts, as in the old ADR system. Where assets are tracked in vintage accounts, a first-in-first-out convention is usually applied to determine basis of assets retired.\n\nAt various times, additional depreciation deductions have been allowed to encourage investment. These allowances generally have had limitations. For example, an additional deduction of 50% of the cost of qualifying property is allowed for certain property acquired after December 31, 2007 and before January 1, 2011 A nearly identical allowance was available for property acquired after September 10, 2001 and before 2005. The IRS recently issued guidance clarifying when taxpayers are eligible for 100 percent bonus depreciation. In addition, the guidance provides procedures for electing 100 percent bonus depreciation and 50 percent bonus depreciation for certain property. In addition to extending the availability of bonus depreciation in general, the Tax Relief Act provided for a new 100 percent depreciation deduction for qualified property that is acquired and placed into service by the taxpayer between September 8, 2010, and January 1, 2014. Special rules have also applied for biofuel, recycling, and disaster assistance property.\n\n\"Decoupling modification\" is a tax terminology resulting from the federal tax law enacted March 9, 2002, which created a new tax deduction for \"bonus depreciation\" that threatened to cost states very large amounts of revenue. Federal Bonus Depreciation, Section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, allows the acceleration of depreciation on federal tax returns, for example, writing off a higher amount of depreciation for the first year an asset goes into service. States that refuse to accept this method of calculating depreciation for state taxes, for example, Iowa and Maryland, publish forms with instructions so stating.\n\nCertain assets must be depreciated under the Alternative Depreciation System (ADS), using specified lives and the straight line method. It may be applied at the election of the taxpayer in lieu of regular depreciation, and it must be used for the following types of property:\n\nIn addition, the ADS must be used for computing depreciation deductions for the Alternative Minimum Tax. ADS lives are the same as regular depreciation lives for a few classes, but are generally somewhat longer than regular lives for most classes.\n\nThe following example is extracted from IRS Publication 946:\n\nYou bought office furniture (7-year property) for $10,000 and placed it in service on October 13, 2013. You use the furniture only for business.\n\nA taxpayer may group assets together into a general asset account. The grouped assets must have the same life, method of depreciation, convention, additional first year depreciation percentage, and year (or quarter or month) placed in service. Listed property or vehicles cannot be grouped with other assets. Depreciation for the account is computed as if the entire account were a single asset.\n\nGain or loss may be deferred or recognized on retirement of assets under MACRS, at the taxpayer's election. Under default rules, proceeds from disposing of a depreciable asset in a multiple asset account are recognized as ordinary income, and depreciation on the account is unaffected by the retirement. An optional method allows the asset to be removed from the account at the start of the year from retirement, in which case gain or loss is on the asset is subject to regular rules.\n\nFrom IRS Publication 946 Excerpt from Table B-1 (many asset classes omitted here)\n\n\nFrom IRS Publication 946 Table A-1.

{"id": "50477", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50477", "title": "Martial law", "text": "Martial law\n\nMartial law is the imposition of direct military control of normal civilian functions of government, especially in response to a temporary emergency such as invasion or major disaster, or in an occupied territory.\n\nMartial law can be used by governments to enforce their rule over the public, as seen in multiple countries listed below.. Such incidents may occur after a coup d'état (Thailand in 2006 and 2014, and Egypt in 2013); when threatened by popular protest (China, Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, 2009's Iranian Green Movement that led to the takeover by Revolutionary Guards); to suppress political opposition (Poland in 1981); or to stabilize insurrections or perceived insurrections (Canada, The October Crisis of 1970). Martial law may be declared in cases of major natural disasters; however, most countries use a different legal construct, such as a state of emergency.\n\nMartial law has also been imposed during conflicts, and in cases of occupations, where the absence of any other civil government provides for an unstable population. Examples of this form of military rule include post World War II reconstruction in Germany and Japan, the recovery and reconstruction of the former Confederate States of America during Reconstruction Era in the United States of America following the American Civil War, and German occupation of northern France between 1871 and 1873 after the Treaty of Frankfurt ended the Franco-Prussian War. \n\nTypically, the imposition of martial law accompanies curfews; the suspension of civil law, civil rights, and habeas corpus; and the application or extension of military law or military justice to civilians. Civilians defying martial law may be subjected to military tribunal (court-martial).\n\nThe Black War was a period of violent conflict between British colonists and Aboriginal Australians in Tasmania from the mid-1820s to 1832. With an escalation of violence in the late 1820s, Lieutenant-Governor George Arthur declared martial law in November 1828—effectively providing legal immunity for killing Aboriginal people. It would remain in force for more than three years, the longest period of martial law in Australian history.\nBrunei has been under a martial law since a rebellion occurred on 8 December 1962 known as the Brunei Revolt and was put down by British troops from Singapore. The Sultan of Brunei, Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mu'izzaddin Waddaulah, is presently the head of state and also the Minister of Defense and Commander in Chief of Royal Brunei Armed Forces\n\nThe War Measures Act was a Government of Canada statute that allowed the government to assume sweeping emergency powers, stopping short of martial law, i.e. the military does not administer justice, which remains in the hands of the courts. The Act has been invoked three times: During World War I, World War II, and the October Crisis of 1970. In 1988, the War Measures Act was replaced by the Emergencies Act.\n\nDuring the colonial era, martial law was proclaimed and applied in the territory of the Province of Quebec during the invasion of Canada by the army of the American Continental Congress in 1775–1776. It was also applied twice in the territory of Lower Canada during the 1837–1838 insurrections. On December 5, following the events of November 1837, martial law was proclaimed in the district of Montréal by Governor Gosford, without the support of the Legislative Assembly in the Parliament of Lower Canada. It was imposed until April 27, 1838. Martial law was proclaimed a second time on November 4, 1838, this time by acting Governor John Colborne, and was applied in the district of Montreal until August 24, 1839.\n\nIn Egypt, a State of Emergency has been in effect almost continuously since 1967. Following the assassination of President Anwar el-Sadat in 1981, a state of emergency was declared. Egypt has been under state of emergency ever since; the Parliament has renewed the emergency laws every three years since they were imposed. The legislation was extended in 2003 and were due to expire at the end of May 2006; plans were in place to replace it with new anti-terrorism laws. But after the Dahab bombings in April of that year, state of emergency was renewed for another two years. In May 2008 there was a further extension to June 2010. In May 2010, the state of emergency was further extended, albeit with a promise from the government to be applied only to 'Terrorism and Drugs' suspects.\n\nA State of Emergency gives military courts the power to try civilians and allows the government to detain for renewable 45-day periods and without court orders anyone deemed to be threatening state security. Public demonstrations are banned under the legislation. On 10 February 2011, the ex-president of Egypt, Hosni Mubarak, promised the deletion of the relevant constitutional article that gives legitimacy to State of Emergency in an attempt to please the mass number of protesters that demanded him to resign. On 11 February 2011, the president stepped down and the vice president Omar Suleiman de facto introduced the country to martial law when transferring all civilian powers from the presidential institution to the military institution. It meant that the presidential executive powers, the parliamentary legislative powers and the judicial powers all transferred directly into the military system which may delegate powers back and forth to any civilian institution within its territory.\n\nThe military issued in its third announcement the \"end of the State of Emergency as soon as order is restored in Egypt\". Before martial law, the Egyptian parliament under the constitution had the civilian power to declare a State of Emergency. When in martial law, the military gained all powers of the state, including to dissolve the parliament and suspend the constitution as it did in its fifth announcement. Under martial law, the only legal framework within the Egyptian territory is the numbered announcements from the military. These announcements could for instance order any civilian laws to come back into force. The military announcements (communiques) are the de facto only current constitution and legal framework for the Egyptian territory. It means that all affairs of the state are bound by the Geneva Conventions.\n\nOn May 18, 2003, during a military activity in Aceh, under the order of the president, Indonesian Army Chief imposed martial law for a period of six months to offensively eliminate the Acehnese separatists.\nOn September 7, 1978, in response to public demonstrations protesting the perceived government involvement in the death of the son of Ayatollah Khomeini, Mostafa Khomeini, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi appointed the chief of army staff, General Gholam Ali Oveisi, as the military governor of the capital city of Tehran. On September 8, the government effectively declared martial law on the capital along with several other cities throughout the country, after which further protests erupted that lead to the army opening fire on a group of protesters in Tehran's Jaleh Square on the same day. Estimates on the number of casualties vary; However, according to Emadeddin Baghi, the number of people killed was 88 of which 64 were gunned down in Jaleh Square. The day is often referred to as Black Friday. Unable to control the unrest, the Shah dissolved the civil government headed by Prime Minister Jafar Sharif-Emami on November 6 and appointed General Gholam Reza Azhari as the prime minister, whom ultimately failed in his efforts to restore order to the country. As he was preparing to leave the country, the Shah dissolved the military government and appointed Shapour Bakhtiar, a reformist critic of his rule, as the new prime minister on January 4, 1979. Bakhtiar's government fell on February 11 and gave rise to the Islamic Republic and the creation of a new constitution.\n\nArticle 79 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran forbids the proclamation of martial law without the approval of the Islamic Consultative Assembly.\nIn 1916 during the Easter Rising, Lord Wimborne the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, declared martial law to maintain order in the streets of Dublin. This was later extended both in duration and geographical reach to the whole of the country with the consent of the British government. Much of Ireland was declared under martial law by the British authorities during the Irish War of Independence. A large portion of Ireland was also under de facto martial law during the Irish Civil War.\n\nThe current Irish Constitution allows for martial law if the government declares a state of emergency, however capital punishment is prohibited in all circumstances, including a state of emergency.\nMilitary administrative government was in effect from 1949 to 1966 over some geographical areas of Israel having large Arab populations, primarily the Negev, Galilee, and the Triangle. The residents of these areas were subject to martial law. The Israeli army enforced strict residency rules. Any Arab not registered in a census taken during November 1948 was deported. Permits from the military governor had to be procured to travel more than a given distance from a person's registered place of residence, and curfew, administrative detentions, and expulsions were common. Although the military administration was officially for geographical areas, and not people, its restrictions were seldom enforced on the Jewish residents of these areas. In the 1950s, martial law ceased to be in effect for those Arab citizens living in predominantly Jewish cities, but remained in place in all Arab localities within Israel until 1966.\n\nFollowing the 1967 war, in which the Israeli army occupied the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Golan Heights in Syria, and Sinai Peninsula in Egypt, martial law over the Palestinian population as well as the Jordanian, Syrian, and Egyptian populations in these areas was put in place. In 1993, Israel agreed to give autonomy to the people of Gaza and disengaged militarily from Gaza from 2005 until 2007, when a military blockade was put in place on Gaza in response to the election of Hamas to the local government.\n\nDuring the 2006 Lebanon war, martial law was declared by Defense Minister Amir Peretz over the north of the country. The Israel Defense Forces were granted the authority to issue instructions to civilians, and to close down offices, schools, camps and factories in cities considered under threat of attack, as well as to impose curfews on cities in the north.\n\nInstructions of the Home Front Command are obligatory under martial law, rather than merely recommended. The order signed by Peretz was in effect for 48 hours and was extended by the Cabinet and the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee over the war's duration.\nMauritius is known as being a \"Westminster\" style of democracy but a peculiar system that was imposed in Mauritius during a period of civil unrest in 1968 as an emergency measure, has never been repealed and is still used by the police force there to this day. The system, which has no apparent foundation in the constitution of Mauritius, enables the police to arrest without having to demonstrate reasonable suspicion that a crime has been carried out but simply on the submission of \"provisional information\" to the magistrate. The accused is then placed on remand or bail and required to report to the police or the court on a regular basis, sometimes every day. There are examples of this system being used to intimidate or coerce individuals in civil litigations.\n\nMartial law was declared in Pakistan on 7 October 1958, by President Iskander Mirza who then appointed General Muhammad Ayub Khan as the Chief Martial Law Administrator and Aziz Ahmad as Secretary General and Deputy Chief Martial Law Administrator. However, three weeks later General Ayub—who had been openly questioning the authority of the government before the imposition of martial law—deposed Iskandar Mirza on 27 October 1958 and assumed the presidency that practically formalized the militarization of the political system in Pakistan. Four years later a new document, Constitution of 1962, was adopted. The second martial law was imposed on 25 March 1969, when President Ayub Khan abrogated the Constitution of 1962 and handed over power to the Army Commander-in-Chief, General Agha Mohammad Yahya Khan. On assuming the presidency, General Yahya Khan acceded to popular demands by abolishing the one-unit system in West Pakistan and ordered general elections on the principle of one man one vote.\n\nThe third was imposed by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the first civilian to hold this post in Pakistan after the Bangladesh Liberation War. On 21 December 1971, Bhutto took this post as well as that of President.\n\nThe fourth was imposed by the General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq on 5 July 1977. After several tumultuous years, which witnessed the secession of East Pakistan, politician Zulfikar Ali Bhutto took over in 1971 as the first civilian martial law administrator in recent history, imposing selective martial law in areas hostile to his rule, such as the country's largest province, Balochistan. Following widespread civil disorder, General Zia overthrew Bhutto and imposed martial law in its totality on July 5, 1977, in a bloodless coup d'état. Unstable areas were brought under control through indirect military action, such as Balochistan under Martial Law Governor, General Rahimuddin Khan. Civilian government resumed in 1988 following General Zia's death in an aircraft crash.\n\nOn October 12, 1999, the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was dissolved, and the Army took control once more. But no martial law was imposed. General Pervez Musharraf took the title of Chief Executive until the President of Pakistan Rafiq Tarar resigned and General Musharraf became president. Elections were held in October 2002 and Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali became Prime Minister of Pakistan. Jamali premiership was followed by Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain and Shaukat Aziz. While the government was supposed to be run by the elected prime minister, there was a common understanding that important decisions were made by the President General Musharraf.\n\nOn November 3, 2007, President General Musharraf declared the state of emergency in the country which is claimed to be equivalent to the state of martial law as the constitution of Pakistan of 1973 was suspended, and the Chief Justices of the Supreme Court were fired.\n\nOn November 12, 2007, Musharraf issued some amendments in the Military Act, which gave the armed forces some additional powers.\n\nDuring the Second World War, President José P. Laurel placed the Philippines (then a client state of Imperial Japan) under martial law via Proclamation № 29, dated 21 September 1944 and enforced the following day at 09:00 PST. Proclamation № 30 was issued on 23 September, declaring the existence of a state of war between the Philippines and the United States and the United Kingdom, effective 10:00 that day.\n\nThe country was under martial law again from 1972 to 1981 under the administration of Ferdinand Marcos. Proclamation № 1081 (\"Proclaiming a State of Martial Law in the Philippines\") was signed on 21 September 1972 and came into force on 22 September. The official reason behind the declaration was to suppress increasing civil strife and the threat of a communist takeover, particularly after a series of bombings (including the Plaza Miranda Incident) and an assassination attempt on Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile in Mandaluyong.\n\nThe policy of martial law was initially well received, but it eventually proved unpopular as the military's human rights abuses (use of torture in intelligence gathering, forced disappearances), along with the decadence and excess of Marcos allies, had emerged. Coupled with economic downturns, these factors fermented dissent in various sectors (e.g. the urban middle class) that crystallised with the assassination of jailed oppositionist senator Benigno Aquino, Jr. in 1983, and widespread fraud in the 1986 snap elections. These eventually led to the 1986 People Power Revolution that ousted Marcos and forced him into exile in Hawaii where he died in 1989; his rival presidential candidate and Aquino's widow, Corazon, was installed as his successor.\n\nDuring this 9-year period, curfews were implemented as a safety measure. Majority of radio and television networks were suspended. Journalists who were accused of speaking against the government were taken as political prisoners, some of them to be physically abused and tortured by the authorities.\n\nOthers have stated that the implementation of Martial Law was taken advantage by the Marcos regime. Billion pesos worth of property and ill-gotten wealth was said to be acquired by Marcos' wife, Imelda Marcos. This alleged money laundering issue was brought back recently, particularly in the \"PiliPinas Debates 2016\" for the recently held Philippine Presidential Elections on May 9, 2016. Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos, Jr., Marcos' son, ran for Vice President and lost.\n\nThere were rumours that President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo was planning to impose martial law to end military \"coup d'etat\" plots, general civilian dissatisfaction, and criticism of her legitimacy arising from the dubious results of the 2004 presidential elections. Instead, a State of National Emergency was imposed in 2006 from 24 February to 3 March, in order to quash a coup attempt and quell protesters.\n\nOn 4 December 2009, President Arroyo officially placed the Province of Maguindanao under a state of martial law through Proclamation № 1959. As with the last imposition, the declaration suspended the writ of habeas corpus in the province. The announcement came days after hundreds of government troops were sent to the province to raid the armories of the powerful Ampatuan clan. The Ampatuans were implicated in the massacre of 58 persons, including women from the rival Mangudadatu clan, human rights lawyers, and 31 media workers. Cited as one of the bloodiest incidents of political violence in Philippine history, the massacre was condemned worldwide as the worst loss of life of media professionals in one day.\n\nOn 23 May 2017, President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines declared martial law in Mindanao, through Proclamation No. 216, due to the attack of Maute Group in Marawi City, Lanao del Sur. It was announced in a briefing in Moscow by Secretary Ernesto Abella, and will be in effect until December.\n\nMartial law was introduced in Communist Poland on December 13, 1981 by Generals Czesław Kiszczak and Wojciech Jaruzelski to prevent democratic opposition from gaining popularity and political power in the country. Thousands of people linked to democratic opposition, including Lech Wałęsa, were arbitrarily arrested and detained. About 100 deaths are attributed to the martial law, including 9 miners shot by the police during the pacification of striking Wujek Coal Mine. The martial law was lifted July 22, 1983. Polish society is divided in opinion on the necessity of introduction of the martial law, which is viewed by some as a lesser evil compared to alleged Soviet military intervention.\nIn October 1946, United States Army Military Government in Korea declared martial law as a result of the Daegu Riot.\nOn November 17, 1948, President Syngman Rhee regime proclaimed a martial law in order to quell the Jeju Uprising.\nOn April 19, 1960 Syngman Rhee government proclaimed a martial law in order to suppress the April Revolution.\nThere are no provisions for martial law as such in Switzerland. Under the \"Army Law\" of 1995, the Army can be called upon by cantonal (state) authorities for assistance (\"Assistenzdienst\"). This regularly happens in the case of natural disasters or special protection requirements (e.g., for the World Economic Forum in Davos). This assistance generally requires parliamentary authorization, though, and takes place in the regular legal framework and under the civilian leadership of the cantonal authorities. On the other hand, the federal authorities are authorized to use the Army to enforce law and order when the Cantons no longer can or want to do so (\"Ordnungsdienst\"). With this came many significant points of reference. This power largely fell into disuse after World War II.\nStill present martial law regime since the 1963 Syrian coup d'état is the longest ranging period of active martial law.\n\nFollowing World War II, the island of Taiwan came back to China's control given the impending withdrawal of Japanese forces and colonial government.　Martial law was declared in 1949 despite the democracy promised in the Constitution of the Republic of China (the Republic of China refused to implement the constitution on Taiwan until after 1949). After the Nationalist-led Republic of China government lost control of the mainland to the Communist Party of China and retreated to Taiwan in 1949, the perceived need to suppress Communist activities in Taiwan was utilised as a rationale for not lifting martial law until thirty-eight years later in 1987, just prior to the death of then President Chiang Ching-kuo.\n\nToday, still present martial law systems like in Syria (since the 1963 Syrian coup d'état) or in the West Bank (since the 1967 Six-Day War with Israel) have surpassed Taiwan as longer ranging periods of active martial law.\nMartial law in Thailand derives statutory authority from the Act promulgated by King Vajiravudh following the abortive Palace Revolt of 1912, entitled Martial Law, B.E. 2457 (1914). Many coups have been attempted or succeeded since then, but the Act governing martial law, amended in 1942, 1944, 1959 and 1972, has remained essentially the same. In January 2004, the Prime Minister of Thailand, Thaksin Shinawatra, declared a state of martial law in the provinces of Pattani, Yala, and Narathiwat in response to the growing South Thailand insurgency. On September 19, 2006, Thailand's army declared martial law following a bloodless military coup in the Thai capital of Bangkok, declared while Prime Minister Shinawatra was in New York City to address the United Nations General Assembly. General Sonthi Boonyaratglin took the control of the government, and soon after handed the premiership to ex-Army Chief General Surayud. Sonthi himself is Chief of the Administrative Reform Council. At 3 am, on May 20, 2014, following seven months of civil and political unrest, Army Commander-in-Chief Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha, declared martial law nationwide.\n\nSince the foundation of the Republic of Turkey in 1923 the military conducted three coups d'état and announced martial law. Martial law between 1978 and 1983 was replaced by a State of emergency in a limited number of provinces that lasted until November 2002. On July 15, 2016 a section of the military in Turkey attempted a coup(failed) and said to have implied martial law in a broadcast on their national television TRT.\n\nThe restrictions from martial law were defined in a 2015 law \"On the Legal Regime of Martial Law\". The president decides on the declaration of martial law and then parliament must approve it.\n\nOn 26 November 2018, lawmakers in the Ukraine Parliament overwhelmingly backed the imposition of martial law along Ukraine's coastal regions and those bordering Russia and Transnistria, a breakaway state of Moldova which has Russian troops stationed in its territory, in response to the firing upon and seizure of Ukrainian naval ships by Russia near the Crimean peninsula a day earlier. A total of 276 lawmakers in Kiev backed the measure, which took effect on 28 November 2018 and will automatically expire in 30 days.\nDuring the Yugoslav Wars in 1991, a \"State of Direct War Threat\" was declared. Although forces from the whole SFRY were included in this conflict, martial law was never announced, but after secession, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina declared martial law. On March 23, 1999, a \"State of Direct War Threat\" was declared in Yugoslavia, following the possibility of NATO air-strikes. The day after strikes began, martial law was declared, which lasted until June 1999, although strikes ended on June 10, following Kumanovo Treaty.\n\nIn the United States, martial law has been used in a limited number of circumstances, such as directly after a foreign attack, such as Hawaii after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor or New Orleans during the Battle of New Orleans, after major disasters, such as the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 or the San Francisco earthquake of 1906, by renegade local leaders seeking to avoid arrest, such as Nauvoo, Illinois during the Illinois Mormon War, or Utah during the Utah War, or in response to chaos associated with protests and mob action, such as the 1934 West Coast waterfront strike, or mob actions against the Freedom Riders. \n\nThe martial law concept in the United States is closely tied with the right of \"habeas corpus\", which is in essence the right to a hearing on lawful imprisonment, or more broadly, the supervision of law enforcement by the judiciary. The ability to suspend \"habeas corpus\" is related to the imposition of martial law. Article 1, Section 9 of the US Constitution states, \"The Privilege of the Writ of \"Habeas Corpus\" shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\" There have been many instances of the use of the military within the borders of the United States, such as during the Whiskey Rebellion and in the South during the Civil Rights Movement, but these acts are not tantamount to a declaration of martial law. The distinction must be made as clear as that between martial law and military justice: deployment of troops does not necessarily mean that the civil courts cannot function, and that is one of the keys, as the Supreme Court noted, to martial law.\n\nIn United States law, martial law is limited by several court decisions that were handed down between the American Civil War and World War II. In 1878, Congress passed the Posse Comitatus Act, which forbids military involvement in domestic law enforcement without congressional approval.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3929577", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3929577", "title": "Mechanical license", "text": "Mechanical license\n\nIn copyright law, a mechanical license is a license that grants certain limited permissions to work with, study, improve upon, reinterpret, re-record (etc.) something that is neither a free/open source item nor in the public domain.\n\nMost modern music consists of two distinct copyright elements. One is the composition itself, which consists of both the musical composition and the lyrics, each which may have separate copyrights. The second is the sound recording, which covers both tangible copies (\"phonorecord\") of the performance of the work (such as vinyl albums, cassette tapes, CDs, and digital formats like MP3s) and public performances of the recording (such as over the radio). The copyright between the composition and the sound recording is frequently held by different parties.\n\nA mechanical license is a license provided by the holder of the copyright of the composition or musical work to another party to cover, reproduce, or sample specific parts of the original composition. Within copyright law within the United states, such mechanical licenses are compulsory; any party may obtain a license without permission of the license holder by paying a set license fee, that as of 2018, was set at 9.1 cents per composition or 1.75 cents per minute of composition which are to go to the composition copyright holder. These fees are paid to agencies like the Harry Fox Agency, who either already represent the composition copyright holders, or are able to direct the funds to the right party. Mechanical licenses do not apply the sound recording portion of the composition, and instead a separate non-mechanical license must be sought from the copyright holder of the sound recording (typically, the musical performer or their agency representing them).\n\nFor example: Puff Daddy wants to sample the opening riff from “Every Breath You Take” by The Police. He contacts the copyright holder of the underlying musical work and gets a mechanical license to use all or part of The Police’s song in his composition. He now has the right to reproduce all or part of “Every Breath You Take” in his new song. He cannot, however, purchase The Police’s Greatest Hits, take the CD (or MP3 from iTunes) into the studio, pull the track off of the phonorecord, and sample the riff into his new song. For Puff Daddy to sample from the phonorecord of The Police’s music, he must get both a mechanical license from the copyright holder of the underlying musical work, \"and\" a license from the copyright holder of the phonorecord from which he copies the sample. He is free to hire musicians to reproduce the Police's sound, but he cannot copy from any phonorecord with only a mechanical license.\n\nA mechanical license can only be used after the original copyright holder has exercised their exclusive right of first publishing, or permission is negotiated.\n\nIn American law, US Code Title 17, Chapter 1, Section 115(a)(2) states: \"A compulsory license includes the privilege of making a musical arrangement of the work to the extent necessary to conform it to the style or manner of interpretation of the performance involved, but the arrangement shall not change the basic melody or fundamental character of the work ...\" thus preventing mechanical licenses being used to make substantially derivative works of a piece of music.\n\nMusicians often use this license for self-promotion. For instance, a cellist who performed a musical work on a recording may obtain a mechanical license so he can distribute copies of the recording to others as an example of his cello playing. Recording artists also use this when they record cover versions of songs. This is common among artists who don't usually write their own songs. In the United States, this is required by copyright law regardless whether or not the copies are for commercial sale.\n\nA mechanical license is not required for artists who record and distribute completely original work.\n\nThe idea of mechanical licenses came about the turn of the 19th century, with the popularity of player pianos, with the ability to play songs encoded on a roll of paper. The sheet music industry then believed that the recreation of their songs was violation of copyright, and initiated legal action that resulted in the Supreme Court of the United States case, \"White-Smith Music Publishing Co. v. Apollo Co.\" (209 U.S. 1) in 1908. The Supreme Court ruled that the piano rolls were not copies of the plantiff's music, but instead part of the machine that created music, and thus player piano and piano roll makers did not have to pay royalties to the sheet music composers. Songwriters lobbied to the United States Congress following the ruling, and succeeded in establishing the nature of mechanical licenses in the Copyright Act of 1909.\n\nSince then, the nature of copyright law with respect to mechanical licenses have been continually updated to include new types of phonorecords mediums and recordings. For example, in October 2006 the Register of Copyright ruled that ring tones are subject to compulsory licensing. The Music Modernization Act passed in 2018 implemented processes for digital streaming services to pay for the compulsory mechanical license through a new non-profit organization created by the law.\n\n"}

{"id": "47704844", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47704844", "title": "Monsanto Co. v. Rohm and Haas Co.", "text": "Monsanto Co. v. Rohm and Haas Co.\n\nMonsanto Co. v. Rohm and Haas Co., 456 F.2d 592 (3d Cir. 1972), is a 1972 decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit interpreting what conduct amounts to fraudulent procurement of a patent. It is one of the early decisions following the Supreme Court's landmark 1964 decision in \"Walker Process v. Food Machinery\" holding fraud on the patent office as potentially violating the Sherman Antitrust Act, and one of the first (if not the first) to hold that failure to disclose material information to the Patent Office was fraudulent.\n\nMonsanto procured U.S. Patent No. No. 3,382,280, issued May 7, 1968, having the title \"3',4'-dichloropropionanilide\" (known as \"3,4-DCPA\" or \"propanil\"), a herbicide that selectively killed weeds without killing crop plants such as rice. In November 1969 Monsanto sued Rohm and Haas for patent infringement. The only substantial issue was the validity of the patent, and that ultimately turned on whether Monsanto had committed fraud on the Patent Office in procuring the patent.\n\nThe application that resulted in the '280 patent was the third of three successive applications, the first two of which were unsuccessful. In the first application, filed in 1957, Monsanto sought a patent on some 100 \"compounds, including 3,4-DCPA and 3,4-DCAA (3,4-dichloroacetanilide), a chemical with some similar properties and a similar physical structure. Monsanto claimed that all the members of the class possessed \"unusual and valuable herbicidal activity,\" while related compounds possessed \"little or no herbicidal efficiency.\" Unpersuaded by Monsanto's arguments, the Patent Office rejected the application as unpatentable over the prior art. In 1961, Monsanto filed a new application claiming another large class of compounds, again including 3,4-DCPA and 3,4-DCAA and again asserting that the class possessed \"unusual and valuable herbicidal activity.\" Again, the Patent Office rejected the application as unpatentable over the prior art. In 1967, Monsanto applied again, this time claiming only 3,4-DCPA and representing only that 3,4-DCPA had \"unusual and valuable herbicidal activity\" and that its activity was \"surprising\" because \"related compounds possess little or no herbicidal efficiency.\" Again. the Patent Office (initially) rejected the application on the ground that the product was obvious over the prior art. But this time Monsanto overcame the rejection.\n\nA major issue in the Patent Office was whether the patent application should be denied because 3,4-DCPA was obvious from previously known products, the most significant of which was 3,4-DCAA (3,4-dichloroacetanilide), a chemical with some similar properties and a similar physical structure. Both were useful in making pigments and both had herbicidal properties. The structural difference between the two \"closely related\" compounds was that 3,4-DCAA \"differ[ed] in its structural formula solely by having one less CH group\" than 3,4-DCPA. Because of the similarity in structure between 3,4-DCPA and other chemicals, including 3,4-DCAA, the Patent Office rejected the patent application on obviousness grounds. Monsanto then tried to persuade the Office to withdraw the rejection by submitting documents to show that DCPA was not obvious, because it had greatly superior and unexpected selective herbicidal activity.\n\nMonsanto filed the Husted Affidavit. The trial court found that this document \"contains no affirmative misrepresentation and is accurate so far as it goes\" but \"it is misleading, and was intended to be misleading, in that it fails to state facts known to the applicant which were inconsistent with its position that propanil is a superior herbicide.\" The court of appeals commented:\n\nThe patent was issued, however, . . . after Monsanto submitted an affidavit of Dr. Robert F. Husted, based on tests performed by him on twenty plant species at three different rates of application per acre. The report as presented to the Patent Office asserted that 3,4-DCPA completely killed or severely injured nine of the eleven species and failed to have any effect on only two. Eight other compounds were reported to have no effect on any of the eleven plants and two other compounds, one of them 3,4-DCAA, either had very slight or no effect. Significantly, although the Husted tests entailed tests on twenty species, at three separate rates of application per acre, the Patent Office was informed of tests on only eleven species and only at one rate of application, two pounds per acre. In all, the affidavit showed less than 25 per cent of Husted's results; of 899 tests, only 110 were submitted. The district court concluded that this close-cropping of Husted's findings amounted to misrepresentation.\n\nUnder applicable law, as understood by the court, if a compound on which a patent is sought is very similar in structure to a known compound, as 3,4-DCPA and 3,4-DCAA were, a rebuttable presumption arises that the later compound is obvious from the earlier one. \"To rebut this presumption it must be shown 'that the claimed compound possesse[d] unobvious or unexpected beneficial properties not actually possessed by the prior art homologue.'𔄿\"\n\nThe Husted Affidavit thus appeared to rebut the obviousness rejection by showing that 3,4-DCPA possessed an unexpected beneficial herbicidal property that 3,4-DCAA and other products lacked. The Husted Affidavit misled the Patent Office, the trial court said, because both 3,4-DCPA and 3,4-DCAA \"in fact possess the newly discovered property of the claimed compound.\"\n\nThe trial court said that Monsanto submitted a fraudulent affidavit in that: \"It is, in short, composed of half-truths.\" The court pointed to such omissions as these which made the affidavit one of half-truths:\n\nFor example, one omitted test result showed that 3,4-DCAA had a complete kill on pigweed at 2 lbs. per acre of application, just as 3,4-DCPA did. . . . Monsanto, by the Husted affidavit, attempted to show that closely related compounds do not possess unique herbicidal properties. The facts not stated were, therefore material.\"\n\nThe district court held the patent invalid and Monsanto appealed top the Third Circuit.\n\nThe Third Circuit affirmed the district court's judgment of fraud (2-1) in an opinion by Circuit Judge Aldisert.\n\nThe court looked at the Husted Affidavit in light of its place in the three successive Monsanto patent applications:\n\nIn view of Huffman's previously unsuccessful attempts to obtain a patent, it is reasonable to conclude that his success with his 1968 application, originally rejected by the examiner, and later accepted after presentation of the Husted Report, was attributed to his emphasis that the compound possessed properties of 'surprising . . . herbicidal efficiency' not possessed by related compounds.\n\nWhether 3,4-DCPA really was surprisingly superior to related compounds as a herbicide was therefore critical to the patent prosecution and to whether Monsanto had committed fraud on the Patent Office. The court rejected Monsanto's argument that in the affidavit it was merely putting its best foot forward:\n\nThe Husted affidavit to the Patent Office did not nearly reflect the total Husted test as transmitted to Huffman. Indeed, an examination of the report permits, if not compels, the misleading inference that it constituted a complete and accurate analysis of all the testing instead of an edited version thereof. Concealment and nondisclosure may be evidence of and equivalent to a false representation, because the concealment or suppression is, in effect, a representation that what is disclosed is the whole truth.\n\nLooking at this pattern of conduct, the court said, \"[W]e cannot bring ourselves to say that the application for the 1968 patent displayed that standard of conduct demanded under the circumstances.\" Rather, \"Monsanto was obliged to disclose more information as to the herbicidal properties of related compounds to the Patent Office than it did.\" The reason is that \"what is at issue is not merely a contest between the parties but a public interest\" that spurious patents should not issue. As a result of Monsanto's truncated disclosure of the facts concerning 3,4-DCPA's comparative efficacy as a herbicide, \"it was impossible for the Patent Office fairly to assess Monsanto's application against the prevailing statutory criteria.\"\n\nThe court concluded:\n\nThus, Monsanto's failure to disclose amounted to misrepresentation transgressing equitable standards of conduct owed the public by the applicant in return for its monopoly. Accordingly, Monsanto was not entitled to the patent monopoly, and the district court did not err in [invalidating the patent].\n\nJudge Kalodner dissented. First, he said, the majority decided the case on the basis of the preponderance of evidence but it should have used the \"clear and convincing evidence\" standard.\n\nSecond, the district court erroneously said that it was not necessary to prove specific intent to deceive the Patent Office \"when there is evidence of a deliberate withholding of material information,\" and that the patent must be rejected \"even if the decision not to disclose was motivated by nothing more than bad judgment as to the materiality of the information.\"\n\nThird, it was not shown that the Patent Office \"would not have issued the patent but for the claimed fraudulent conduct.\" There was no proof that the Patent Office was misled.\n\nIn an article in the \"George Washington Law Review\", Irving Kayton criticized \"the Third Circuit's ignorance of the accepted manner and practice, defined by statute and rule, in which patent prosecution takes place.\" Kayton said that it was the responsibility of the patent examiner to review the records of the earlier stages of the patent prosecution, and there is a legal presumption that the examiner did that; that examination would have disclosed the information that Monsanto withheld in the Husted Affidavit. Accordingly, Kayton argued, \"Monsanto['s] patent solicitor was thus completely justified in attributing actual, but at the least, constructive knowledge to the examiner of the contents of the disclosures of both the 1961 and 1957 applications.\" Co-author Richard H. Stern disagreed with his colleague on this issue. Stern maintained, \"The proposed reliance on constructive knowledge, and the indulgence in legal fictions and presumptions that follows, has far more flavor of a determination not to learn damaging facts than it has of the candor required in such cases.\"\n\nMoreover, argued Kayton, the fact that the Third Circuit and the judge in the similar Texas case disagreed over whether Monsanto was just \"putting its best foot forward\" or instead was intentionally defrauding the Patent Office indicates that reasonable men can differ: \"This being so, is it not an inescapable conclusion . . . that the Monsanto patent solicitor's [conduct] . . . was at worst a nonculpable mistake of judgment?\" Again, co-author Stern disagreed: \"No. The Third Circuit, on the contrary, appears to have thought that Judge Singleton's views were plainly erroneous, and that his acceptance of the patentee's theory that 'it is all right to put your best foot forward with the Patent Office' was contrary to the legal standard as to candor required in ex parte proceedings of this type. Given so thoroughly erroneous a concept of the standard of candor, it is neither surprising that in the circumstances\nof this case the judge using that legal standard found no fraud nor surprising that the judges rejecting it found fraud.\"\n\nAnother discussion of this case faults the district court's decision for purporting to invalidate the patent for fraud, and by implication the subsequent Third Circuit affirmance. The stated basis of the criticism is that fraudulent procurement does not invalidate a patent, but merely makes it permanently unenforceable.\n"}

{"id": "11515778", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11515778", "title": "Oil and gas law in the United States", "text": "Oil and gas law in the United States\n\nOil and gas law in the United States is the branch of law that pertains to the acquisition and ownership rights in oil and gas both under the soil before discovery and after its capture, and adjudication regarding those rights.\n\nThe law regulating oil and gas ownership in the US generally differs significantly from laws in Europe because oil and gas are often owned privately in the US as opposed to being owned by the national government in many other countries.\n\nIn the U.S., extraction of oil and gas is generally regulated by the individual states through statutes and common law. Federal and constitutional law apply as well.\n\nIn the United States, oil and gas rights to a particular parcel may be owned by private individuals, corporations, Indian tribes, or by local, state, or federal governments. Oil and gas rights extend vertically downward from the property line. Unless explicitly separated by a deed, oil and gas rights are owned by the surface landowner.\n\nOil and gas rights offshore are owned by either the state or federal government and leased to oil companies for development. The tidelands controversy involve the limits of state ownership.\n\nAlthough oil and gas laws vary by state, the laws regarding ownership prior to, at, and after extraction are nearly universal.\n\nBecause oil and gas are fluids, they may flow in the subsurface across property boundaries. In this way, an operator may permissibly extract oil and gas from beneath the land of another, if the extraction is lawfully conducted on his own property. An operator may not angle a well to penetrate beneath property not owned by or leased to him.\n\nThe two conflicting legal doctrines covering oil and gas extraction are the rule of capture, and the correlative rights doctrine. Which of the doctrines applies in a particular case depends on state law, which varies considerably from state to state, or in the case of the federal offshore zone, on U.S. federal law.\n\nThe rule of capture provides that an oil producer with a wellbore on his property is allowed to drain oil out from underneath his land—even if some of that oil originated from a neighbor's land, migrating to the oil producer's land through geologic forces or drainage. The rule of capture gives landowners an incentive to pump out oil as quickly as possible by accelerating operations or drilling multiple wells to capture the oil of their neighbors. Such practice may deplete the gas pressure needed to force oil from the ground, which will reduce the amount of oil available for recovery from that reservoir. State law often limits the rule of capture to protect correlative rights of neighboring owners. Government agencies and state oil and gas conservation commissions, such as the Texas Railroad Commission, have developed conservation laws which regulate extraction by individual owners to protect the rights of the mineral owners and to prevent economic and physical waste.\n\nMineral rights may be severed by a deed from the surface rights. Such a condition is called a split estate. Once severed from surface ownership, oil and gas rights may be bought, sold, or transferred, like other real estate property. Ownership in the oil and gas rights for different horizontal layers, or strata, may be further divided and sold to different parties. In some states, severed mineral rights revert to the landowner if the mineral right not exercised for a certain time period.\n\nIn most states, unless otherwise specified by a deed, the owner of the oil and gas interest is presumed to have the right to occupy as much of the surface property as is reasonably needed to extract the oil and gas, subject to regulations for minimum distances from homes or buildings. Courts have generally held that, without this implied right of access and surface occupancy, ownership of the oil and gas rights would be meaningless. This is called subsurface supremacy.\n\nRefined hydrocarbons that escape into the ground are not subject to the law of capture, unless evidence shows that the refiner abandoned them. Extracted oil and gas which are subsequently stored in underground reservoirs are considered as personal property, rather than as an interest in real estate.\n\nOil and gas producing companies do not always own the land they drill on. Often, the company (the \"lessee\") leases the mineral rights from the owner (the \"lessor\"). Major points in a lease include the description of the property, the term (duration), and the payments to the lessor.\n\nLessees of mineral rights have a right of reasonable access to leased land to explore, develop, and transport minerals, unless the lease specifies otherwise (a \"no-surface access\" lease).\n\nA lease remains in effect for a certain period of time, called the primary term, as long as the lessee pays the annual rental. The lease expires after the primary term, unless drilling or oil and gas production has started on the lease. If production is established, the lease will remain in effect past the primary term, as long as the lease continuously produces oil or gas. The lease can however, be revived by virtue of delay rentals. Delay rentals are fees paid to the lessor, to delay production or commencement of drilling, without terminating the lease. There are other clauses that also revive the lease.\n\nTo commence drilling a well under the habendum clause means that substantial preparations for such drilling has to be undertaken, as long as such measures have been commenced in good faith and with due diligence. The habendum clause sets out these terms, as well as most significantly, identifying the parties to the transaction and their interests in the conveyed real property.\n\nAn oil and gas lease generally includes a \"force majeure\" clause. Such agreement relieves the lessee from liability for breach, if the party's performance is impeded as the result of a natural cause that could not have been anticipated or prevented. This Act of God must completely prevent performance and must be unanticipated. Courts often construe this clause very strictly and rarely enforce it. For example, a tornado preventing performance in Oklahoma would not trigger the \"force majeure\" clause, since tornadoes are a common occurrence in Oklahoma.\n\nThe Responsible Federal Oil and Gas Lease Act (2008), also called the \"Use It or Lose It\" bill (HR 6251 IH), proposed prohibiting the Secretary of the Interior from issuing new federal oil and gas leases to holders of existing leases who do not either diligently develop the lands subject to such existing leases or relinquish such leases. This bill failed to pass in the House of Representatives.\n\nUnless specified otherwise, establishing commercial production from a single well within the lease will hold the entire lease as long as production continues. Language to the contrary is called a Pugh clause. A Pugh clause may specify that a producing well may hold only a specified area around that well; after the primary term, the mineral owner is free to lease the rest of the land to others. \n\nA vertical Pugh clause limits the lease to certain depths or certain geological formations. A common form of a vertical Pugh clause limits the depths held by production from the ground surface down to the deepest producing formation established by the end of the primary term. \n\nPayments to the lessor typically take three forms: bonus, rental, and royalties, as negotiated between the parties. The bonus is an up-front payment made at the time the lease takes effect. The rental is an annual payment, usually made until such time as the property begins producing oil or gas in commercial quantities.\n\nThe royalty is a portion of the gross value of any oil or gas produced from the lease that is paid to the mineral owner. It is not a portion of profits, for it is paid without deducting costs of drilling, completing, or operating the well. Whether or not the operator can deduct costs of treating, transporting, or marketing the oil and gas, if not specified in the lease, has been a matter of legal dispute. The traditional royalty rate for oil and gas in the United States was one-eighth (12.5 percent), although today it is often higher. Some states, such as Pennsylvania and West Virginia, have set the legal minimum royalty for private oil and gas leases to one-eighth.\n\nIn an \"unless-delay rental\" lease, a lessee agrees to pay delay rentals so long as the lessee is not drilling on the property. An \"unless\" oil and gas lease terminates automatically, if the lessee fails to drill within the specified time or pay the delay rentals as called for in the lease.\n\nOil and gas contracts have nuances which differ from standard contracts. For example, when an assignment of an oil and gas lease expressly provides that any extension or renewal of the lease is subject to an overriding royalty, a new lease that is substantially similar to the first lease and procured by the assignee during the term of the first lease, is regarded, as a matter of law, as an extension of renewal of the first lease.\n\nStatutes can override agreements made by parties. For instance, a statute may void an agreement to indemnify a construction worker as to liability for death or bodily injury incurred on an oil well, regardless of the indemnitee's negligence, without affecting the validity of an insurance contract. It affirms the right of an individual party to obtain insurance, not to protect the interests of the indemnitee. These suits for negligence are typically brought by drilling site workers known as roustabouts.\n\nThe two most common contractual agreements entered into by oil and gas companies are the Farmout Agreement and the Joint Operating Agreement. A farmout agreement, generally, is between one company that owns a lease, and another company that wishes to drill the property. The company wishing to drill, called the farmee, provides drilling services in exchange for a majority interest in the lease owned by the farmor. \n\nIn some cases, oil and gas rights or leases in a drilling unit are held by more than one company or person who wish to participate in drilling and production. In such cases, the various interests sign a Joint Operating Agreement, a contract entered into by two or more ownership or leasehold co-tenants to jointly explore and develop the oil and gas property, including operations, voting mechanisms, subsequent operations, risk-sharing, indemnities and exculpatory provisions, revenue allocation, title examination and title issues, and future acquisitions and divestitures in the contract area. One company is designated as the operator, and operates the property on a day-to-day basis.\n\nThere are various terms describing ownership interests in an oil or gas well. An interest signifying a duty to pay expenses is called:\n\nInterests in receiving income include:\n\nFor any oil and gas property, the total working interests must add up to 100%. The sum of the net revenue interests, royalty interests, and overriding royalty interests, must also add up to 100%.\n\nLaw school classes teaching oil and gas law generally require that students first take a class in property and contract law. In Texas and Wyoming, oil and gas law is tested on the bar exam.\n\nOil and gas law practitioners usually fall into three broad categories. First, oil and gas companies usually have in-house attorneys that advise the company of its rights and the legal issues. These attorneys are usually assisted by landmen, who examine property titles, land oil and gas rights, and acquire property for the company. Landmen may be lawyers themselves. Second, practitioners may represent private parties. When an oil company attempts to obtain land from a private party, a party may retain counsel to be better informed of his or her rights and to negotiate a favorable bargain with the oil company. Last, oil and gas attorneys work for federal and state governments that oversee energy and environmental policy and land acquisitions.\n\nThere are several not-for-profit foundations that exist to further the practical and scholarly study of oil and gas law, for example the Energy and Mineral Law Foundation and the Rocky Mountain Mineral Law Foundation.\n\nRegulation of oil and gas drilling and production are largely left to the states, except for federal offshore waters, where operations are regulated by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. The names and organizational structures of the state agencies overseeing oil and gas extraction vary. In Texas, oil and gas are regulated by the Texas Railroad Commission, in Oklahoma by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, and in North Dakota by the Industrial Commission. In Colorado and Wyoming, the agencies are the state Oil and Gas Conservation Commissions.\n\nLocal control of oil and gas operations is contentious. The key legal issue is generally whether, or to what extent, state regulations preempt local controls. The result varies state-to-state.\n\nStates require a drilling permit before a well begins drilling. Requirements to receive drilling permits generally include minimum setbacks from lease or unit boundaries, and adequate casing and cementing programs. \n\nStates generally require permits for or notices of major work done on a well, and periodic reports of oil and gas produced.\n\nWhen a well reaches the end of economic production, it must be plugged according to the terms of a plugging permit.\n\nWhere the onshore oil and gas rights are owned by the federal government, as is the case for much land in the western United States, the various permits must also be obtained from the Bureau of Land Management as well as the state, which may have different requirements than the equivalent state permits.\n\n\n"}

Its most prominent project, CKAN, is used by many of the world's governments to host open catalogues of data that their countries possess.\n\nThe organisation tends to support its aims by hosting infrastructure for semi-independent projects to develop. This approach to organising was hinted as one of its earliest projects was a project management service called KnowledgeForge, which runs on the KForge platform. \"KnowledgeForge\" allows sectoral working groups to have space to manage projects related to open knowledge. More widely, the project infrastructure includes both technical and face-to-face aspects.

The operation resulted in convictions and imprisonment of a number of domestic terrorists, many of which were members of the Animal Liberation Front and Earth Liberation Front.\n\nIn 2004 the FBI merged seven independent investigations from its Portland, Oregon field office and called them \"Operation Backfire\". According to an agency statement, the operational focus is on investigating acts of domestic terrorism, carried out on behalf of two activist groups, the Earth Liberation Front (ELF) and Animal Liberation Front (ALF).\n\nIn December 2005 and January 2006, with assistance from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the FBI indicted six women and seven men on a total of 65 charges, including arson, conspiracy, use of destructive devices, and destruction of an energy facility. The defendants were named as Joseph Mahmoud Dibee]], Chelsea Dawn Gerlach, Sarah Kendall Harvey (née Kendall Tankersley), Daniel McGowan, Stanislas Meyerhoff, Josephine Sunshine Overaker, Jonathan Paul, Rebecca Jeanette Rubin, Suzanne Savoie, Justin Franchi Solondz, Darren Thurston, Kevin Tubbs, and Briana Waters. A number of other unindicted co-conspirators were also named. A 13th alleged co-conspirator, William \"Bill\" Rodgers, also known as Avalon, committed suicide while in police custody.\n\nAccording to reports, and their own websites, most of the indicted individuals initially claimed to be innocent of the charges.\nProsecutors alleged that the 11 conspirators collectively referred to themselves as \"The Family\" and had taken an oath to protect each other. The FBI indicated that some of the charges relate to a 1998 arson attack, claimed by the ELF, on the Vail Ski Resort in Colorado. Other charges were related to another attack on the botany labs at the University of Washington in 2001. The combined cost of the damage from the attacks is estimated at approaching $80 million.\n\nIn late 2006, a number of self-described ELF members pleaded guilty to arson and other charges in U.S. federal courts.\n\nOn November 11, 2006, Joyanna Zacher, Nathan Block, Daniel McGowan and Jonathan Paul pleaded guilty to several eco-sabotage related charges, as part of a global resolution agreement with prosecutors. Judge Ann Aiken presided over the hearings. The change of pleas from the four defendants resolves all current \"Operation Backfire\" cases in Oregon.\n\nOn December 15, 2006, Chelsea Dawn Gerlach and Stanislas Gregory Meyerhoff, pleaded guilty to $20 million worth of arsons committed between 1996 and 2001 by the Eugene-based cell of the ELF known as \"The Family\". Their fire-bombing of a Vail ski resort resulted in damages totaling $12 million, with the FBI characterizing the ELF as the United States' \"top domestic terrorism threat\". Gerlach has previously pleaded guilty to 18 counts of arson in other attacks, saying she was motivated by \"a deep sense of despair and anger at the deteriorating state of the global environment,\" but adding that she has \"since realized the firebombings did more harm than good.\" Meyerhoff has renounced ELF and pleaded guilty to 54 counts, but is still under indictment in Michigan, Arizona, Washington, Wyoming and California.\n\nOn March 6, 2008, Briana Waters, who was arrested in Operation Backfire for another ELF attack in Washington State, was found guilty of two counts of arson and sentenced later that year to six years in prison.\n\nThe FBI alleged that the group was led by William C. Rodgers, who was arrested in December 2005 and committed suicide in jail just before he was to be transferred to Oregon. Josephine Sunshine Overaker, has not been apprehended; she is believed to be in Spain.\n\nJustin Franchi Solondz was arrested in Dali, China in March 2009 on charges of growing marijuana. He pleaded guilty to manufacturing drugs in a daylong trial and was sentenced to three years in prison by a local court. He was deported back to the U.S. to face charges there after serving his sentence. On December 20, 2011, Solondz pleaded guilty to planning the UW arson. On March 16, 2012, Solondz was sentenced to seven years in prison. \n\nRebecca Jeanette Rubin surrendered to FBI agents at the Canada–US border in Blaine, Washington on 29 November 2012. On October 10, 2013, Rubin pleaded guilty to arson and conspiracy charges, but refused to turn over the names of other people who were involved in the actions she took in the name of the ALF and ELF. On January 27, 2014, U.S. District Judge Ann Aiken sentenced Rubin to five years in prison and 200 hours of community service, declining to impose the two and a half year terrorism enhancement sought by the prosecution.\n\nJoseph Mahmoud Dibee, was apprehended in Cuba and returned to the US in 2018. Dibee was believed to be beyond the reach of the FBI in Syria, which has no diplomatic relations with the United States, and was ultimately discovered to be traveling through Central America, en route to Russia. With the assistance of Cuban authorities, the FBI detained him before he could board a plane to Russia, and brought him to Portland for trial.\n\nIn January and February 2006, as a result of separate investigations, but widely reported as extensions of \"Operation Backfire\", three more individuals, Zachary Jenson, Eric McDavid and Lauren Weiner, were arrested in Auburn, California for conspiring to damage facilities \"by explosive or fire.\" Eric McDavid, the only one of the three who refused to sign a plea agreement, was found guilty on all counts, and faces up to 20 years in prison, and a $250,000 fine, when sentenced on the 6th of December. In Washington, Nathan Block and Joyanna Zacher were arrested on charges relating to a 2001 arson on a farm near Clatskanie, Oregon and in Tucson, Arizona, Rod Coronado, a prominent American eco-anarchist, was arrested on a felony charge of demonstrating the use of a destructive device.\n\nThe indictments of the 18 activists for alleged acts of eco-terrorism have drawn condemnation from activists and alternative media organizations. The National Lawyers Guild condemned the operation and the resulting indictments, arguing that \"life sentences for property damage offenses where the actor has no intent to harm an individual are simply unconstitutional.\" Animal liberation activist and physician Jerry Vlasak accused the FBI of targeting \"a bunch of above-ground, well-known, peaceful animal-rights activists and environmental activists and charg[ing] them with being members of the ALF and the ELF.\"\n\nIn response, then-U.S. Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales argued that \"there's a clear difference between constitutionally protected advocacy — which is the right of all Americans — and violent criminal activity.\"\n\n\n"}

Registering a work at that database allows for certain permitted uses of that work by cultural heritage institutions.\n\nOrphan works are works like books, newspaper articles, or films, which may be protected under copyright but for which the copyright holder cannot be found. A substantial portion of the collections of Europe's cultural institutions are orphan works (e.g. the British Library estimates that 40 per cent of its copyrighted collections, 150 million works in total, are orphan works). Orphan works are not available for legal use by filmmakers, archivists, writers, musicians, and broadcasters. Public libraries, educational institutions and museums, that digitise old manuscripts, books, sound recordings and film, may choose to not digitise orphan works, or make orphan works available to the public, for fear that a re-appearing rights-holder may sue them for damages.\n\nThe EU has set out large-scale digitisation programs (such as Europeana) and in order for these programs to be successful, common rules on how to deal with orphan works need to be established.\n\nThis directive applies to the following orphan works that were created in the EU:\n\n\nUnder certain conditions, the directive can also apply to unpublished works (such as letters or manuscripts).\nIf orphaned software and video games (\"Abandonware\") fall under the \"audiovisual works\" definition is debated.\n\nThe directive provides regulations on how to identify orphan works. An organisation that wishes to digitise a work in question has to conduct a scrupulous search to find its copyright holder. In this search, it should rely on sources such as databases and registries like ARROW for text and image-based works. A registry for orphan film is currently developed by ACE – Association of European Film Archives and Cinematheques in the FORWARD project. A diligent search guideline and tool has also been developed by the EnDOW project.. Its tool for diligent searches is available for 20 European Union Member states. It is hoped that other sectors will develop similar information databases.\n\nThe directive also establishes that if a search does not find the identity or location of the copyright holder, the work shall be officially recognised as an orphan work. This status shall be valid for the whole of the European Union, which means the organisation will be able to make it available online in all Member States. The directive also foresees the establishment of a single European registry of all recognised orphan works that will be set up and run by EUIPO, the European Union Intellectual Property Office based in Alicante.\n\nWorks identified as orphan works can be used by beneficiary organisations to achieve aims related to their public interest mission. They will be allowed to conclude public-private partnerships with commercial operators and to generate revenues from the use of orphan works to cover digitisation costs.\n\nUnder this directive, a reappearing copyright-holder can assert his/her copyright and thereby end the orphan work status.\n\n"}
{"id": "12002825", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12002825", "title": "Pearson v. Chung", "text": "Pearson v. Chung\n\nPearson v. Chung, better known as the \"pants lawsuit,\" is a civil case filed in 2005 by Roy L. Pearson, Jr., at the time an administrative law judge, in the District of Columbia in the United States, following a dispute with a dry cleaning company over a lost pair of trousers. Pearson filed suit against Soo Chung, Jin Nam Chung, and Ki Y. Chung, the owners of Custom Cleaners in Washington, D.C., initially demanding $67 million for inconvenience, mental anguish, and attorney's fees for representing himself, as a result of their failure, in Pearson's opinion, to live up to a \"satisfaction guaranteed\" sign that was displayed in the store. The case drew international attention when it went to trial in 2007, and has been held up as an example of frivolous litigation and the need for tort reform in the United States.\n\nPearson sued a D.C. dry cleaning establishment, Custom Cleaners, for over $67 million for the loss of a pair of pants. On May 3, 2005, Pearson allegedly left a pair of gray pants that could be distinguished by a unique trio of belt loops on both sides of the front waistband. After a delay due to the pants being mistakenly sent to another dry cleaners, the pants were offered back completed several days after May 5, 2005, the initial pickup date. Pearson refused to accept the pants, claiming they were not his, despite confirmation by the cleaners' records, tags, and Pearson's receipt. Pearson demanded what he claimed to be the price of the pants as compensation, an amount of over $1000, which the Chungs refused. As a result, Pearson filed suit in the District of Columbia's Superior Court. The judge to whom the case was presented decided to bring it to trial on the basis of two of Pearson's claims. The first claim was the issue of the ownership by Pearson of the presented pair of pants. The second claim was on the issue of signs posted outside the business, advertising \"Same Day Service\" and \"Satisfaction Guaranteed,\" which Pearson claimed to be misleading.\n\nOver time, the Chungs presented three settlement offers in the amounts of $3000, $4600, and $12,000—all of which were rejected by Pearson. D.C. Superior Court Judge Neal Kravitz stated that \"the court has significant concerns that the plaintiff is acting in bad faith.\" The judge resolved some of the issues in the Chungs' favor in response to their motion for summary judgment (which was filed at the close of discovery), but could not dismiss the case because some facts were in dispute.\n\nThe owners of the business, South Korean immigrants Jin Nam Chung, Soo Chung, and their son, Ki Chung, were reportedly considering moving back to South Korea. After an outpouring of support for the Chungs from members of the public, a website was set up to accept donations for the Chungs' legal defense.\n\nOn May 30, 2007, Pearson reduced his demands to $54 million in damages rather than $67 million. Among his requests were $500,000 in attorney's fees, $2 million for \"discomfort, inconvenience, and mental distress,\" and $15,000, which he claimed would be the cost to rent a car every weekend to drive to another dry cleaning service. The remaining $51.5 million would be used to help similarly dissatisfied D.C. consumers sue businesses. Pearson also re-focused his lawsuit from the missing pants to the removal of window signs for \"Satisfaction Guaranteed\" and \"Same Day Service.\" Pearson claimed the signs represented fraud on the part of the Chungs. The Chungs' lawyer, Christopher Manning, alleged that the signs could only be considered fraud if a reasonable person would be misled by them, and that a reasonable person would not see the signs as an unconditional promise. The Chungs' lawyer portrayed Pearson as a bitter, financially insolvent man; under questioning, Pearson admitted that, at the start of the court case, he had only $1000–2000 in the bank due to divorce proceedings, and was collecting unemployment benefits.\n\nOn June 12, 2007, the trial began. Pearson broke down in tears during an explanation about his frustration after losing his pants, and a short recess had to be declared.\n\nOn June 25, 2007, the trial ended with District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Judith Bartnoff ruling in favor of the dry cleaners, and awarding them court costs pursuant to a motion which the Chungs later withdrew. The court took judicial notice of Pearson's divorce proceedings, where he was sanctioned $12,000 by the trial court for \"creating unnecessary litigation and threatening both his wife, Rhonda VanLowe, and her lawyer with disbarment.\"\n\nPearson made a motion on July 11, 2007, to reconsider in the trial court, stating that he felt the judge had \"committed a fundamental legal error,\" and had failed to address his legal claims. Pearson stated he believed the court had imposed its own conditional interpretation of \"satisfaction guaranteed,\" rather than what Pearson believes is an offer of unconditional and unambiguous satisfaction. The court denied the motion.\n\nIt was revealed on August 2, 2007 that a panel recommended Pearson not be given a ten-year term as an administrative law judge after his initial two-year term expired mid-2007, in part because his suit against Mr. Chung demonstrated a lack of \"judicial temperament.\" Pearson was appointed in 2005 and stood to lose his $100,512 salary if a hearing upheld that decision. On October 22, a D.C. commission voted against reappointing Pearson to the bench of the Office of Administrative Hearings. On November 14, it was confirmed that Pearson had lost his job by not being affirmed for an extension.\n\nRoy Pearson filed suit against Washington, D.C. on May 2, 2008, claiming that he had been wrongfully dismissed for exposing corruption within the Office of Administrative Hearings. Pearson sought $1 million in compensation for lost wages and punitive damages as well as his job back. On July 23, 2009, federal district judge Ellen Segal Huvelle dismissed Pearson's May 2008 lawsuit, ruling the District of Columbia had not broken the law by declining to reappoint him as an administrative law judge. Pearson had maintained in the suit that the failure to reappoint him to the ten-year term was in part intended as retaliation for his suit against the dry cleaners. Pearson lost his appeal when the D.C. Circuit ruled against him on May 27, 2010.\n\nThe Chungs moved to recover $83,000 in attorneys' fees and to impose sanctions, but withdrew the motion after recovering their costs through fund-raising. The Chungs stated that they did so in the hopes of persuading Pearson to stop litigating, but on August 14, 2007, Pearson filed a notice of appeal.\n\nOn September 10, 2008, Pearson filed an appeal to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, where oral argument was held on October 22, 2008 before a three-judge panel consisting of judges Phyllis Thompson, Noel Anketell Kramer and Michael W. Farrell. Manning represented the Chungs on the appeal \"pro bono\", and Pearson represented himself pro se. On December 18, 2008, the panel that heard Pearson's appeal announced that they were rejecting it. According to the \"Washington Post\", \"Pearson has two remaining avenues of appeal left: He could ask the entire nine-judge appellate court to review the case, or ask the U.S. Supreme Court to weigh in.\" On January 6, 2009, Pearson filed a petition with the D.C. Court of Appeals, requesting the case be reheard en banc by the full nine-judge court. On March 2, 2009, the appeals court denied the petition. Pearson's final option was to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case. The 90-day deadline for seeking Supreme Court review elapsed without Pearson filing a petition for \"certiorari\", bringing the dispute to an end.\n\nThe unusual circumstances of this case led the \"Wall Street Journal\", the \"Washington Post\", and dozens of bloggers to refer to it as \"The Great American Pants Suit,\" and to Pearson as \"Judge Fancy Pants.\" The case has garnered considerable international attention. BBC News quoted Chris Manning, attorney for the Chung family, as saying that the experience for the Chungs has become the \"American nightmare\"—an ironic reference to the American Dream. \"Fortune\" magazine listed the case at #37 in its \"101 Dumbest Moments in Business\" of 2007. \"Cracked.com\" listed the case as \"Exhibit 1\" in its 2008 article \"9 Insane Cases that Prove the US Legal System Is Screwed.\"\n\nOn July 24, 2007, the American Tort Reform Association and the Institute for Legal Reform of the United States Chamber of Commerce hosted a fundraiser for the Chungs to help pay their attorneys fees that reported having raised up to $64,000. The Chungs say they have received close to $100,000 from supporters to cover their attorneys' fees and lost business.\n\nOn September 19, 2007, citing a loss of revenue and emotional strain from the lawsuit, the Chungs announced they had closed and sold the dry cleaning shop involved in the dispute. The Chungs still owned one additional dry cleaning shop and said they would be focusing their attention and resources on their remaining shop.\n\nThe incident and lawsuit served as a basis for \"Bottomless,\" an 18th-season episode of \"Law & Order\", which aired originally on 16 January 2008.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1284324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1284324", "title": "Permanent residency", "text": "Permanent residency\n\nPermanent residency refers to a person's resident status in a country of which they are not a citizen. This is usually for an indefinite period; a person with such status is known as a permanent resident.\n\nPermanent residency itself is distinct from right of abode, which waives immigration control for such persons. Persons having permanent residency still require immigration control if they do not have right of abode. However, a right of abode automatically grants people permanent residency. This status also gives work permit in most cases.\n\nNot every country allows permanent residency. Rights and application may vary widely.\n\nAll European Union countries have a facility for someone to become a permanent resident, as EU legislation allows an EU national who moves to another EU country to attain permanent resident status after residing there for five years. The European Union also sets out permanent residency rights for long-term resident third country nationals under directive (2003/109/EC). A novel approach was the granting of rights across the national borders of states adhering to the directive.\n\nOther countries have varying forms of such residency and relationships with other countries with regards to permanent residency.\nThe regions that have some type of permanent resident status include:\n\n\nA \"golden visa\" is a permanent residency visa issued to individuals who invest, often through the purchase of property, a certain sum of money into the issuing county. Dating back to the 1980s, golden visas became much more popular and available in the 21st century. Golden visas require investments of anywhere from $100,000 in Dominica up to £2,000,000 in the U.K. The most common method for obtaining a golden visa is through the purchase of real estate with a minimum value. Some countries such as Malta and Cyprus also offer \"golden passports\" (citizenship) to individuals if they invest a certain sum.\n\nThe issuing of so-called \"golden visas\" has sparked controversy in several countries.\n\nDepending on the country, permanent residents usually have the same rights as citizens except for the following:\n\nPermanent residents may be required to fulfil specific residence obligations to maintain their status. In some cases, permanent residency may be conditional on a certain type of employment or maintenance of a business.\n\nMany countries have compulsory military service for citizens. Some countries, such as Singapore, extend this to permanent residents. However, in Singapore, most first generation permanent residents are exempted, and only their sons are held liable for NS.\n\nIn a similar approach, the United States has Selective Service, a compulsory \"registration\" for military service, which is required of all male citizens and permanent residents ages 18 to 26; this requirement theoretically applies even to those residing in the country illegally. Applications for citizenship may be denied or otherwise impeded if the applicant cannot prove having complied with this requirement.\n\nPermanent residents may be required to reside in the country offering them residence for a given minimum length of time (as in Australia and Canada). Permanent residents may lose their status if they stay outside their host country for more than a specified period of time (as in the United States).\n\nPermanent residents have the same obligations as citizens regarding taxes.\n\nPermanent residents may lose their status if they fail to comply with residency or other obligations imposed on them. For example:\n\nUsually permanent residents may apply for citizenship by naturalization after a period of permanent residency (typically five years) in the country concerned.\nDual citizenship may or may not be permitted.\n\nIn many nations an application for naturalization can be denied on character grounds, sometimes allowing people to reside in the country (as non-domiciled) but not become citizens. In the United States the residency requirements for citizenship are normally five years, even though permanent residents who have been married to a US citizen for three years or more may apply in three years. Those who have served in the armed forces may qualify for an expedited process allowing citizenship after only one year, or even without any residence requirement.\n\nSince the 1990s, in addition to golden visas some countries have begun to offer golden passports to foreign nationals who invest (often through the purchase of property) a certain sum into the issuing country's economy. The issuing of EU passports by Malta and Cyprus has sparked controversy but is expected to produced billions of euros in revenue for the issuing countries.\n\nFull permanent residence rights are granted automatically between the following:\n\nIn some cases (e.g., the member states of the European Union) citizens of participating countries can live and work at will in each other's states, but don't have a status fully equivalent to that of a permanent resident. In particular, under the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement, Australia and New Zealand grant each other's citizens the right to reside permanently and work in each country; however, the rights and entitlements of New Zealanders living in Australia under this arrangement (the so-called Special Category Visa) are somewhat short of those of Australian permanent residents, in particular with respect to unemployment benefits and similar benefits.\n\nPeople who are granted permanent residency in a country are usually issued some sort of documentary evidence as legal proof of this status. In the past, many countries merely stamped the person's passport indicating that the holder was admitted as a permanent resident or that he/she was exempt from immigration control and permitted to work without restriction. Other countries would issue a photo ID card, place a visa sticker or certificate of residence in the person's passport, or issue a letter to confirm their permanent resident status.\n\nIn Australia and New Zealand, a printout of permanent residence visa or resident visa is stuck to a page of the permanent resident's passport. \n(On 1 September 2015, Australia ceased issuing visa labels to holders of Australian visas.) \n\nIn Canada, permanent residents are issued a photo ID card known as Permanent Resident Card.\n\nIn Costa Rica, permanent residents are issued a photo ID card commonly referred to as a \"cedula\".\n\nIn the countries of the European Union, residency permits are a photo ID card following a common EU design.\n\nIn Germany, resident permits \"(Aufenthaltstitel)\" have been issued as photo ID cards following a common EU design since 1 September 2011. Prior to that date, residence permits were stickers (similar to visas) which were affixed to the resident's passport.\n\nIn Ghana, permanent residents are issued an Indefinite Residence permit which is in the form of a sticker attached into the resident's passport.\n\nIn Hong Kong, permanent residents are issued a Hong Kong Permanent Identity Card.\n\nIn Japan and South Korea, all resident foreigners are issued a residence card, and for permanent residents this status is indicated.\n\nIn Lithuania, permanent residents are issued a photo ID \"(Leidimas gyventi)\" following a common EU design.\n\nIn Macau, permanent residents are issued a Macao Permanent Resident Identity Card (\"Bilhete de Identidade de Residente Permanente\").\n\nIn Malaysia, permanent residents are issued with a MyPR card similar to the MyKad issued to Malaysian citizens, the difference being the colour (red instead of blue) and additional information stating the cardholder's country of origin.\n\nIn Singapore, permanent residents are issued a blue identity card with their photograph, thumb print and other personal particulars similar to citizen's pink identity card\n\nIn Slovakia, permanent residents are issued a red photo ID.\n\nIn South Africa, permanent residents who have their passport endorsed, are issued a certificate and a standard national green identity book showing \"NON S.A. CITIZEN\".\n\nIn Switzerland, permanent residents are issued either a biometric ID card in accordance with Schengen regulations if they are non EU/EFTA national, or a paper permit in a yellow-coloured plastic wallet if they are an EU/EFTA national.\n\nIn Taiwan, permanent residents are issued a blue photo ID card (APRC). A separate open work permit can also be issued to permanent residents allowing them to accept employment in any non-governmental positions for which they are qualified. \nIn the United Kingdom, the applicant is issued with a photo ID card known as a Biometric Residence Permit which states that the permit is a Settlement permit for Indefinite Leave to Remain.\n\nIn the United States, permanent residents are non-citizens issued a photo ID card which is officially known as a Permanent Resident Card, also known as a \"green card\".\n\n\n"}

It is made with a telecine machine from an analog source and is typically of a lower quality than other retail releases.\n\nIn telecine (TK) is the digitization performed by the studio itself with very professional (and expensive) equipment and usually from the original source. The purpose of it is to create a high quality digital copy (usually for a later DVD release). But unlike a DVD, an R5 is released before the digital post-processing is finished. The quality of the rips can widely differ, but an R5 can be almost indistinguishable from a DVDRip since many unauthorized film copies are published onto DVD with minimal editing.\n\nThis digital post-processing is an important step, and provides many qualitative benefits to the finished conversion and should not be under-appreciated. From color correction to grain removal/reduction there are many steps that improve the transfer that generally the R5 does not have, even if done by the originating studio.\n\nThe name R5 refers to DVD Region 5. In an effort to compete with copyright infringement in these areas, the movie industry chose to create a new format for DVD releases that could be produced more quickly and less expensively than traditional DVD releases. R5 releases differ from normal releases in that they often lack both the image post-processing and special features that are common on DVD releases. This allows the film to be released for sale at the same time that DVD screeners are released. Since these screeners are the chief source of high-quality pre-DVD release unauthorized film copies (in comparison to cam or telesync, mostly), this allows the movie studios to beat the infringers to market. Bootlegged copies of these releases are often distributed on the internet and in some cases, R5 DVDs may be released without an English audio track, requiring the encoder to use the direct line audio from the film's theatrical release. In this case, the unauthorized release will be tagged with \"LiNE\" to distinguish it from a release with a DVD audio track.\nBefore PUKKA/DREAMLiGHT introduced the R5 tag to the warez scene, the R5 releases were tagged as TC, DVDSCR or DVDRip.\n\nThe image quality of an R5 release is generally comparable to a DVD Screener release, except without the added scrolling text and black and white scenes that serve to distinguish screeners from commercial DVD releases. R5 quality can be somewhat better than transfers produced by movie bootleggers because the transfer is performed using professional-grade film scanning equipment.\n"}

The right of option still exists with regard to cardinalitial titles.\n\nIn this way the canon law first established an ‘’incompatibility’’, giving life to the prohibition of the simultaneous possession of two ecclesiastical benefices.

{"id": "55329944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55329944", "title": "Rule of lenity", "text": "Rule of lenity\n\nThe rule of lenity (also called the rule of strict construction) is a principle of criminal statutory interpretation that requires a court to apply any unclear or ambiguous law in the manner most favorable to the defendant. It has a long history in the law and has been an important element of the relationship between the courts and legislature, although its role in modern jurisprudence is less clear.\n\nToday, determining legislative intent is a critical job that arises from the distinct and separate roles played by the judiciary and the legislature in administering justice. Judges are routinely required to apply the relevant laws and rules passed by the legislature to the decisions they make. There are reasons this can be difficult.\n\nFor one, laws are intended to apply generally and it would be impossible for the legislature to foresee all the possible situations to which they might apply after their enactment. Second, the manner in which laws are passed, which includes the influence of lobbying and interest groups, can sometimes obscure their purpose when finally enacted. Finally, the two branches are not allowed to \"confer\" with one another. Neither is the legislature allowed to add to a law it has already passed in order to affect a court's ruling, nor are the courts allowed to \"inquire\" as to how a law should be applied in the cases before them.\n\nThe two institutions have evolved tools to make the job easier. For instance, statutes often contain \"definition\" sections, which attempt to make plain how the statute should be read. The courts have developed \"canons of construction\", rules which are intended to guide the manner in which a statute is to be applied.\n\nThe rule of lenity is one such canon. Implicit in its provisions is the additional burden placed on the prosecution in a criminal case and the protection of individual rights against the powers of the state. It also furthers the fundamental principle of requiring notice in criminal law. Individuals should not be punished for their acts when the law fails to communicate to the public that such acts are forbidden.\n\nIt is intended only to apply to those instances where the court recognizes the existence of more than one interpretation \"and\" where the decision that the court reaches harms or benefits the defendant to some greater or lesser degree. In that case, the rule requires the court to select the interpretation most beneficial (or least detrimental) to the defendant.\n\nThe traditional rule, also called the rule of strict construction, arose for a very different purpose in the English common law than those cited in U.S. law.\n\nOriginally, the rule was conceived by English judges trying to limit Parliament's use of the death penalty. When the facts of a case were not expressly described by a law, the court would \"strictly construe\" it so as to exclude its application to the case in question.\n\nA 1547, a law passed that denied a lesser sentence to first-time offenders convicted of \"felonious stealing of Horses, Geldings or Mares\" among other offenses. The courts interpreted the law as only applying to those convicted of stealing two or more horses and allowed first-offenders who stole one horse to continue to avail themselves of the lesser penalty. The following year, Parliament explicitly addressed the rule's use with the passage of a new law, solely dedicated to horse thievery. They pointed to the prior law's \"ambiguous\" wording and its construction by the courts. The new law explicitly stated that those convicted of stealing \"any Horse, Gelding, or Mare\" shall be treated the same as those charged with \"stealing two Horses, two Geldings, or two Mares, or any other\".\n\nUnder the reign of George II, another law concerning first-offenders and livestock was similarly limited by the courts. This time, the act ambiguously referred to \"Sheep, or other Cattle.\" Again, the following year, Parliament passed a new \"Act to Explain An Act\". In it, they expressly spell out that it shall apply to \"any Bull, Cow, Ox, Steer, Bullock, Heifer, Calf and Lamb, as well as sheep\".\n\nLaying out the rule's application in the American courts, it was first cited in 1820 by Chief Justice John Marshall in \"United States v. Wiltberger\":\n\nThe rule that penal laws are to be construed strictly, is perhaps not much less old than construction itself. It is founded on the tenderness of the law for the rights of individuals; and on the plain principle, that the power of punishment is vested in the legislative, not in the judicial department.\n[T]hough penal laws are to be construed strictly, they are not to be construed so strictly as to defeat the obvious intention of the legislature. The maxim is not to be so applied as to narrow the words of the statute... in their ordinary acceptation, or in which the legislature has obviously used them... The intention of the legislature is to be collected from the words they employ. Where there is no ambiguity in *the words, there is no room for construction.\n\nAfter its initial wide acceptance, other canons, such as the clear statement rule and the vagueness doctrine, have encroached on the rule and its use by the courts. In 1961, Justice Frankfurter wrote in \"Callanan v. United States\", that the rule is for expressing the will of Congress, not protecting defendants from it:\n\nThe rule of lenity [is] for resolving an ambiguity, not [creating one]... The rule comes into operation at the end of the process of interpreting what Congress has expressed, not at the beginning as an overriding consideration of being lenient to wrongdoers.\n\nIslamic law has a similar tenet which allows the imposition of punishments only in the absence of \"doubt or ambiguity\".\n\nThe rule is today seen as an expression of legislative supremacy. It is infrequently cited in contemporary opinions.\n\nDuring oral arguments for the 2016 case, \"Lockhart v. United States\", Justice Antonin Scalia \"sua sponte\" raised the question of the rule's application:\n\n\"... what I worry about is the rule of lenity. You have these dueling canons, and you have a rule that when the government sends somebody to jail for 10 years, it has to cross sharp corners. It has to dot every i and cross every t. It has to be clear!\"\n\nIn the end, he joined the majority in refusing to apply the rule.\n\nIn \"State v. Thonesavanh\", The Minnesota Supreme Court expressly rejected the position that the rule \"...allows a defendant to prevail in every instance in which a criminal statute is ambiguous.\" At issue was the question of whether the word \"take\" as used in the state's law against auto theft required the accused to actually move the vehicle, or, as in the case before them, merely to enter it and lock the doors. The court relied on the doctrine of \"in pari materia\" in holding that the mere \"temporary control\" of the car was enough under the statue.\n\nOn the other hand, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court cited the rule in \"Commonwealth vs. Dayton\", in ruling that the ambiguous language in the state's OUI law did not permit a suspect to be held without bail unless they have been convicted three times under the statute, as opposed to merely being \"arrested\" three times.\n\nThe states of Florida and Ohio have codified the rule. The Florida statute states that the code \"shall be strictly construed; when the language is susceptible of differing constructions, it shall be construed most favorably to the accused.\" The Ohio law states simply that offenses and penalties shall be \"strictly construed against the state and liberally construed in favor of the accused.\"\n\nA greater number of states, however, have statutorily eliminated the rule.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38306107", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38306107", "title": "Thai nationality law", "text": "Thai nationality law\n\nThai nationality law includes principles of both \"jus sanguinis\" and \"jus soli\". Thailand's first Nationality Act was passed in 1913. The most recent law dates to 2008.\n\nPersons born anywhere in the world to at least one parent with Thai citizenship themselves are entitled to Thai citizenship at birth.\nThe first Thai Nationality Act of 1913 and most subsequent acts have included the principle of \"jus soli\", though at times with various restrictions. The 1952 Nationality Act rescinded the 1913 act's provisions for \"jus soli\", in response to concerns over the integration of the children of Chinese immigrants, but unlimited \"jus soli\" was restored just four years later by the 1956 Nationality Act. In 1972, due to illegal immigration from Burma and concerns over communist insurgency in border areas, the Nationality Act was amended to require that both parents be legally resident and domiciled in Thailand for at least five years in order for their child to be granted Thai citizenship at birth, and revoked citizenship from many people who had it under the earlier act. This caused difficulties for members of hill tribes in border areas who were not registered in the 1956 census, since they had no way to prove that their parents were Thai as opposed to having entered the country as refugees.\n\nArticle 23 of the 2008 Nationality Act reversed the 1972 act, restoring citizenship to those who had it before, and allowing people born in Thailand before 1992 to apply for Thai citizenship anew. However, applicants have reported various difficulties in getting government officials to process their applications. Following the act's passage, one of the first people to gain citizenship under Article 23 was Fongchan Suksaneh, a child of American missionaries to the Mlabri people who was born in Chiang Mai Province. Children, neither of whose parents are citizens and at least one of whose parents is an illegal alien, remain not entitled to \"jus soli\" citizenship. Furthermore, someone who has Thai citizenship by sole virtue of \"jus soli\" may still lose Thai citizenship under various conditions of the 2008 act (such as living abroad) which do not apply to people who have Thai citizenship by virtue of \"jus sanguinis\". In 2013, the Ministry of Interior proposed new immigration regulations, based on Section 7 of the 2008 Nationality Act, to declare children who did not gain Thai citizenship at birth as illegal immigrants and have them deported.\n\nThe strictness of Thailand's requirements for naturalisation have varied over the years, beginning with fairly loose restrictions, which were tightened in the mid-20th century before being loosened again. The Nationality Act of 1939 tightened the requirements, stipulating that applicants for naturalisation had to abandon their foreign names and take Thai names, as well as send their children to Thai schools; these rules were part of a broader trend of laws designed to promote the assimilation of the Thai Chinese community. From 1935 to 1958, a total of 4,652 Chinese naturalised as Thai citizens. More than half of the naturalisations occurred in 1943 alone, during the Japanese occupation of Thailand, apparently driven by the desire to escape wartime restrictions on foreigners.\n\nUnder the 1992 Nationality Act, naturalisation as a Thai citizen requires five years of residence in Thailand, as well as proof of a certain minimum income and renunciation of one's previous citizenship. The period of residence is reduced to three years for foreign women married to Thai men. In 2003, 48 people applied for naturalisation, of whom ten were approved.\n\nUnder Section 99 of the 2007 Constitution of Thailand, a naturalised citizen does not gain the right to vote until five years after naturalisation; under Sections 101, 115, 174, and 205, naturalised citizens have no right at all to stand for election to the House of Representatives or the Senate, or to be appointed as a minister or a justice of the Constitutional Court.\n\n there were 443,862 stateless people in Thailand who were born in Thailand and live there. Mostly they are from hill tribes or are the children of illegal migrants, most of them from Myanmar. Stateless people in Thailand suffer serious disadvantages. Unlike Thai citizens, they cannot use government facilities where they must first show an ID card. They cannot go to a clinic or hospital for treatment of illness or injury. They cannot open a bank account. They cannot buy and use a smartphone, or own and drive a car, or buy property or a home. Some progress is being made, but \"...these efforts are halfhearted and plagued with bureaucratic hurdles\" according to the \"Bangkok Post\". It gives as an example a new law, passed in 2008, that grants Thai citizenship to stateless people. But it applies only to those who were born before 26 February 1992, thus impacting the young most harshly. The good news is that stateless children can now attend state schools. Also, a new law allows stateless people to seek employment in professions not explicitly reserved for Thais. State hospitals now issue birth certificates to all children, a formality often neglected in the past. Importantly, the Thai military government has adopted the goal of \"zero statelessness\" by 2024.\n\n\n\n"}

While India generally follows the UK approach, there are certain differences which may indicate judicial activism, hence creating controversy. Tort is breach of some duty independent of contract which has caused damage to the plaintiff giving rise to civil cause of action and for which remedy is available. If there is no remedy it cannot be called a tort because the essence of tort is to give remedy to the person who has suffered injury.\n\nTort law in India, like her common law counterparts, stems from both statute and common law.\n\nSimilar to other common law countries, aspects of tort law have been codified. Furthermore, the Indian Penal Code criminalises certain areas of tort law.\n\nAs tort law is a relatively young area of law in India, apart from referring to local judicial precedents, courts have readily referred to case law from other common law jurisdictions, such as UK, Australia, and Canada.\n\nHowever, attention is given to local socio-cultural practices and conditions in applying foreign legal principles. The legislature have also created statutes to provide for certain social conditions; for example, due to the nature of Indian families, a statute was passed to simplify determination of damages in the event of family members.\n\nIndian courts have held that to constitute assault it is not necessary that there should be some actual hurt caused. A threat constitutes assault.\n\nThe ingredients are set out below:\n\n\nThe criteria for battery is equivalent to that of criminal force defined in Section 350 of the Indian Penal Code.\n\nFalse imprisonment \"is the complete deprivation of his liberty for any time, however short, without lawful cause ... There need not be any actual imprisonment in the ordinary sense.\"\n\nThe ingredients of this tort are listed below:\n\n\nIn regard to negligence, Indian jurisprudence have approved the approach stated in \"Ratanlal & Dhirajlal: The Law of Torts\", laying down three elements:\n\n\nThe Indian approach to professional negligence requires that any skilled task requires a skilled professional. Such a professional would be expected to be exercising his skill with reasonable competence.\n\nProfessionals may be held liable for negligence on one of two findings:\n\n\nThe standard to be applied for judging negligence would be that of an ordinary competent person exercising ordinary skill in that profession. It is not necessary for every professional to possess the highest level of expertise in that branch which he practices. Professional opinion is generally accepted, but courts may rule otherwise if they feel that the opinion is \"not reasonable or responsible\".\n\nIndian Courts recognise the concept of contributory negligence. Contributory negligence means the failure by a person to use reasonable care for the safety of either of himself or his property, so that he becomes blameworthy in part as an \"author of his own wrong\".\n\nIn the absence of reasonable care on the part of the claimant, courts are likely to reduce the liability of the injurer. \"The rule of negligence with the defense of contributory negligence holds an injurer liable if and only if he was negligent and the victim was not. In India, this rule requires proportional sharing of liability when both parties were negligent. That is, the compensation that the victim receives gets reduced in proportion to his or her negligence.\"\n\nThe tort of defamation in India has largely followed the approach taken by the UK. Indian courts have endorsed the defences of absolute and qualified privilege, fair comment and justification. In UK, if the defendant is only successful in proving the truth of some of the several charges against him, the defence of justification might still be available if the charges not proved do not materially injure the reputation. While there is no such provision in India, the law is possibly the same. Recently, incidents of defamation in relation to public figures are highlighted.\n\nHowever, in India, the weight of the authorities is for discarding between libel and slander and making both of them actionable \"per se\". In UK, only libel and certain types of slander is actionable \"per se\". Criminal libel in UK was abolished in 2010, while both slander and libel remain criminal offences in India, making people liable not just to the extent of damages but also undergoing imprisonment. An injunction may also be granted to stop further publication of defamatory material.\n\nEconomic Torts seek to protect a person in relation to his trade, business or livelihood.\n\nWhile Indian courts has been reluctant to award damages for the economic torts of simple and unlawful conspiracy as well as inducing breach of contract due to the confused state of the law, the court has allowed damages for torts affecting economic interests under the conspiracy to injure, and in doing so, referred to UK authorities on the matter.\n\nThe courts have however been more willing to adopt the law in UK in areas such as the tort of deceit, unlawful interference with trade, intimidation, and malicious falsehood.\n\nLand torts seek to prevent interference with land in the possession of another. Interference may take the form of entering land or part of it, or of remaining there after the withdrawal of permission, or of dispossessing the occupant.\n\nTrespass to land is any direct interference with land in the possession of another and is actionable \"per se\". Examples of trespass are unauthorised entry to land, placing things on land and inducing animals to enter. Also, continuing trespass, which is actionable from day to day, occurs when there is continuation of presence after permission is withdrawn. The position taken with regards to the elements of trespass is similar in the UK and India.\n\nNuisance is a form of lesser interference with land. It may be private or public, and private nuisance has come to cover the conduct of the defendants which affects the claimant's interest in the land. This could be done by:\n\n\nWhile private nuisance is always actionable, public nuisance is not. A claimant of public nuisance has to establish special loss over and above the inconvenience suffered by the public in general, as public nuisance is a crime and it would be unreasonable for everyone inconvenienced by it to be allowed to claim. This distinction was followed in India, along with the UK principles of nuisance.\n\nAnyone who in the course of \"non-natural\" use of his land \"accumulates\" thereon for his own purposes anything likely to do mischief if it escapes is answerable for all direct damage thereby caused. It imposes strict liability on certain areas of nuisance law.\n\nWhile in the UK, this rule is strictly \"a remedy for damage to land or interests in land\" and \"damages for personal injuries are not recoverable under the rule\", in India, the courts have developed this rule into a separate area of absolute liability rule, where an enterprise is absolutely liable, without exceptions, to compensate everyone affected by any accident resulting from the operation of hazardous activity. This differs greatly from the UK approach as it includes all kinds of resulting liability other than damage to land.\n\nAnother area of tort that developed in India which differs from the UK is the availability of constitutional torts. Creating constitutional torts is a public law remedy for violations of rights, generally by agents of the state, and is implicitly premised on the strict liability principle. The tort was further entrenched when the court allowed compensation to be awarded as \"a remedy available in public law; based on strict liability for the contravention of fundamental rights to which the principle of sovereign immunity does not apply, even though it may be available as a defence in private law in an action based on tort\". This approach is vastly different from the approach taken in UK as compensation for damages is not an available public law remedy.\n\nDamages in the law of torts in India are premised on the concept of \"restitutio ad integrum\". India adopts a compensatory method and advocates \"full and fair compensation\" in all cases.\n\nIn determining the quantum of damages, the Indian court will look to similar cases that may enable comparison.\n\nIndia’s formulation of damages for tort cases is premised on the multiplier method, awarding compensation based on the degree of compromise to the earning ability of the victim. Under the multiplier method, the fair and just amount represents\n\nThe multiplier principle is encapsulated in a statutory form for tortious cases involving personal injuries caused by motor vehicles, under the Motor Vehicle Act. However, in so calculating, the court will take into account inflation in calculating damages.\n\nFor instances of pecuniary damages with regards to personal injury, the following heads will be taken into account:\n\n\nIn instances of non-pecuniary loss, the following will be taken into consideration:\n\n\nAggravated damages may be awarded to compensate victims for their wounded feelings in tortious cases in certain cases. These damages are determined by examining if the defendant's conduct aggravated the plaintiff's damage by injuring \"feelings of dignity, safety and pride\".\n\nIn analysing pain and suffering, several factors such as severity of injury, medical treatment required, psychological stress and long-term physical and emotional scars, would be taken into account.\n\nIn cases of victims who were unconscious, one must award not only for the \"loss of amenities and loss of expectation of life, but also for pain and suffering\". Such damages are awarded not as a matter of \"solace\". This view comes close to that expressed by Lord Scarman in \"Lim Poh Choo v Camden and Islington Area Health Authority\", difference being that an award must be \"made even for pain and suffering in case of unconscious plaintiffs\". The reason for so doing is that it \"looks strange that wrongdoer whose negligence makes the victim unconscious is placed in a more advantageous position than one who inflicts a lesser injury which does not render the victim unconscious\".\n\nThere are three guiding principles in measuring the quantum of compensation for pain and suffering:\n\n\nBeing influenced by \"Rookes v Barnard\", the India Court ruled that punitive damages can be awarded in only three categories:\n\n\nHowever, this stand has since shifted with an expanding tort jurisdiction. The Supreme Court accepted a committee's suggestion to evolve a \"principle of liability – punitive in nature – on account of vandalism and rioting\". The reasoning given was that it \"would deter people from similar behaviour in the future\".\n\nIn an environmental tort case, the defendant was made to pay exemplary damages \"so that it may act as deterrent for others not to cause pollution in any manner\".\n\nDespite being often cited as a litigious country, the rate of litigation is low, due to problems such as long delays, heavy expenses and meagre damage awards. There has apparently been an increase in litigation over the past years, especially with cases involving the government. This has been said to be due to India’s socio-economic growth and the resultant sensitisation regarding legal rights.\n\nThe delay in delivery of justice is a major problem plaguing India. This has been attributed to reasons such a low judge to population ratio (1 judge per 100,000 capita, with a small number of courts available), as well as poor administrative governance.\n\nOutmoded procedural laws allow for delaying tactics, such as interlocutory appeals and stay orders. The government has also been accused of employing delay tactics whenever it is a litigant, appealing even when the chance of success is remote. As a result, the system appears to resemble a \"sunk cost auction\", where litigants invest ever-increasing amounts to stave off higher losses.\n\nDue to the problems noted above, it has been stated that reformation lay with the parliamentarians and legislators. Structural reforms are to be brought about by amendments to legislation, while operational reforms can only be brought about by \"a change in mindset\".\n\nOne of the controversies in Indian tort law concerns the rule on absolute liability. The extremely strict approach, where even acts of God are not recognised as a defence is severely criticised especially since it disregarded the \"generally accepted parameter of minimum competence and reasonable care\". The implementation of such a rule endangers the growth of science and technical industries, as investors have to take the risk of liability given that there is no defence to the rule.\n\nThe judiciary has been criticised for being overly activist and overstepping its jurisdiction. By creating constitutional torts, they are accused of usurping both legislative and administrative functions. Controversy further arose when judges began to read such obligations of the state into Article 21 of the Indian Constitution to impose vicarious liability on the state. However, such judicial activism in India has been used for \"achieving social and distributive justice.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "54223909", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54223909", "title": "Trademarks Act, 2004", "text": "Trademarks Act, 2004\n\nThe TRADEMARKS ACT, 2004 (The Act) is legislation enacted by the Third Parliament of the Fourth Republic of Ghana and signed into law by President John Agyekum Kufuor. The Act regulates the process through which trademarks and collective marks are registered, the issuance of registered trademarks and how trademarks and collective marks are protected through the enforcement of the Act. The rationale for enacting the Act is for the protection of the goodwill and reputation of the business of a proprietor. The Act establishes the Trademark Registry(Registar) to which is mandated to register trademarks and issue registered trademarks.The Act has been amended by the Trademarks (Amendment) Act, 2014 (Act 876)(The Amendment) which came into force on 25 July 2014. The Amendment incorporated the Madrid Protocol into The Act. \n\nThis Act is made up of fifty-four (54) sections and three (3) schedules that are arranged under various headings as follows;\n\nPer the Amendment, a trademark means, sign or combination of signs including words such as personal names, letters, numerals, and figurative elements. A trademark may consist of words, personal names, designs, letters, colours, numerals, shapes, holograms, sounds or a combination of any of these elements; slogans, where they are not long enough to be protected by copyrights. \n\nThe application for registration of a trademark must be filed with the Registrar and is contingent on the payment of a prescribed fee. The application must contain a reproduction of the trademark and a list of goods or services for which for which the registration of the trademark is made and the applicant must have a \"bona fide\" intention for which the trademark is to be used in relation to goods or services. The application may contain a declaration claiming the priority of an earlier national or regional application filed by the applicant or the predecessor in title of the applicant. \n\nAn application for registration can be refused on several grounds such as where the trademark is a trade name, it is incapable of distinguishing the goods or services of one enterprise from the goods or services of another enterprise or devoid of distinctive character, it is contrary to public order or morality or it is likely to mislead the public or trade circles with particular reference to the geographical origin of the goods or services, their nature or characteristics among others. \n\nOnce the Registrar has examined the application for registration of the trademark and is satisfied that it complies with all the Act, the Registrar shall then publish the application as to allow any interested person to file a notice of opposition claiming that one or more of the requirements have not been met. When the Registrar sends a copy of the notice of opposition to the applicant and the applicant does not respond to the claims of the notice, the applicant will be deemed to have abandoned the application.\n\nWhere the application has not been opposed within the prescribed time limit or any oppositions were granted in favour of the applicant and the Registrar is satisfied that the application has met all necessary requirement, the Registrar shall then register the trademark, publish a reference to the registration and issue the applicant with a certificate of registration. When the trademark has been published trademark enjoys the same rights and privileges as if the trademark has been registered so long as the application has been published.\n\nThe Amendment defines a collective mark is a visual sign capable of distinguishing the origin or any other characteristic of different enterprises which use the sign under the control of a registered owner from any other enterprises or a collective mark can be a visual sign cable of distinguishing the origin of the quality of goods or services of different enterprises which use the sign under the control of a registered owner from goods and services of any other enterprises. The former meaning can be described as a collective membership mark as the mark only serves to show membership in a collective group of enterprises and the collective itself does not use the mark to identify its products or services. The latter meaning of collective mark can be described as a collective mark for commerce as the mark is intended to identify the goods or service as belonging to a certain membership of enterprises.\n\nThe registration procedure for collective marks is the same as the registration procedure for trademarks, and thus the Registrar may grant an applicant a registration certificate for a collective mark once he is satisfied that all requirements have been met. The only difference between the registration of trademarks and collective marks is that an application for registration of a collective mark shall designate the trademark as a collective mark and shall be accompanied with a copy of the regulations governing the use of the collective mark. \n\nA person other than a registered owner of a trademark shall not knowingly infringe the rights of the owner of a registered trademark by using a trademark in relation to goods or services for which the trademark was registered without the consent of the owner. A person may also not use signs that are similar and identical to the registered trademark as the registered owner's right extend to such identical signs. In the Ghanaian case of \"Menkish Impex Limited v Pam Ventures Limited\", it was held that, in relation to the two marks ‘’Heaven’’ and ‘’Dhoom’’, they are not so similar as to qualify for an infringement of trademark. The defendant’s mark ‘’Dhoom’’ was held not to resemble the Plaintiff’s registered mark as to cause the likelihood of confusion and deception.\n\nAlthough the registered owner of a trademark has exclusive rights, such rights are limited to an extent. The rights conferred by registration do not extend, thus in turn no infringement claim can arise, to acts in respect of articles which have been put on the market in any country by the registered owner or with the consent of the owner. \n\nOnce the registered owner establishes an infringement of trademark, either by the authorised use of the registered trademark or acts likely to infringe the trademark, the registered owner may institute court action against a person who infringes a registered trademark and such a person may be held to have committed an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine of two hundred and fifty (250) penalty units or term of imprisonment not exceeding one year or both. \n\nThe duration of a registered trademark is for a period of ten(10) years from the filing date of the application for registration and may be renewed for a consecutive period of ten years subject to the payment of a prescribed fee for renewal. The registration of a collective mark enjoys the same duration and renewal rights as a trademark.\n\nAn already registered trademark may be invalidated on two grounds, namely; \n\nAn already registered collective mark may be invalidated on three grounds, namely; \n\n\n\nAn already registered trademark, although not invalid, may be removed from the register of trademarks where a person interested in a trademark requests the Registrar to remove a trademark from the register because the trademark had not been used for a continuous period of five years or more. A collective mark may also be removed from the register in accordance with the procedure applied to trademarks.\n\nAn application for a change in the ownership of a trademark or collective mark shall be in writing and be filed with the Registrar. The owner of a trademark may transfer the trademark in whole or in part for the goods or services for which it has been registered. Also where a person transfers an enterprise's, it is impliedly deemed that such a person has also transferred the trademark rights of the enterprise.\n\nA licence contract concerning the registration of a trademark or an application for registration shall be filed with the Registrar for which the contents shall be kept confidential but a reference to it will be published and if the said licence contract is not properly filed with the Registrar it is ineffective against third parties. For a licence contract to be valid, the licensor must have effective control over the quality of the goods or services of the licensee in connection with which the mark is used.\n\nAn applicant who has a registered trademark in Ghana but is an ordinary resident outside of Ghana's jurisdiction must be represented by a legal practitioner resident in the country.\n\nThe registry is mandated to make a register of trademarks for keeping records of all registered trademarks. In cases of collective marks (trademarks of companies) the registry is required to provide a special section in the register to keep them. Application for a trademark is to be in writing and it would only be granted if it is applied directly for a trade description or applied to goods; or it is applied to a covering label, reel, or any other thing in which the goods are sold or manufactured. After the application has been granted, a person (whether natural or legal) could be represented by the said trademark, the person is entitled to use it in businesses or in any kind of advertisement.\n\nAn entry in the register would be rectified or erased upon request where there has been an omission, error or a defect in the registration by the affected person. This request may be made to the registrar who further forwards the application to the high court. The application for rectification does not in any way affect the validation of the trademark unless it found that the trademark was made fraudulently. The time for correction of the errors may be extended on notice to the parties concerned and on the terms directed by the Registrar. The register as provided by the act is opened to the public; it is to be published in the gazette. \n\nAn offence under The Act is any offence that is in relation to the unauthorised use of a trademark in relation to goods or any offence involving dishonesty and deception with a trademark.\n\nA person is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding five hundred penalty units or to a term of imprisonment not exceeding two years or to both the fine and the imprisonment when he applies a false trade description to goods; or forges a trademark; or use or possesses an article or instrument to forge a trademark; or sells or exposes for sale or for any purpose of trade or manufacture goods or things to which a forged trademark or false trade description is applied. In cases where prosecution for an offence where goods are imported, evidence of the port of shipment is \"prima facie\" evidence of the place of origin of the goods.\n\nWhere a person is convicted of an offence the goods and things of any kind by means of or in relation to which the offence is committed are liable, at the discretion of the Court, to be surrendered to the State.\n\nHowever, a person may not be prosecuted after three years from the commission of the offence, or one year after the first discovery of the commission, by the prosecutor, whichever occurs first.\n\nAgain a person for the purpose of gain or the intent to cause loss to an owner of a trademark applies that trademark or a trademark that is likely to be mistaken for a registered one to goods or labelling or advertising of goods or as a business paper in relation to goods or has possession of goods with that sign of trademark, or has an article in possession his or her control or in the course of business with the intent to sell ,hire or distribute for any purpose of trade commits an offence and is liable on a summary conviction to a fine of not less than two thousand penalty units and not more than seven thousand penalty units or to a term of imprisonment not less than five years and not more than fifteen years or both. A person who is charged with these offences is not entitled to bail, food, drugs, medical services, household chemicals, cosmetics, vehicle machine parts or electrical appliances.\n\nA person may claim the acts done were of pure intent thus not for defrauding purposes. Also, he could claim he in good faith believed the trademark was genuine. Again reasonable precautions were taken against committing the offence charged or the relevant information was given to the police officer with respect to the persons on whose behalf the trademark, mark, or description was applied.\n\nA person may apply to the court for an order for the forfeiture goods which bears an identical sign or likely to be mistaken to his and are in connection with the investigation or prosecution of an offence for the court to release the goods materials or articles on condition that the person causes the sign to be obliterated and complies with any order to pay costs which has been made against that person. A person aggrieved by the order of the decision of the court may appeal.\n\nA buyer is mandated to accept trademarked good or trade description from a seller if there are no issues of fraud or forgery to the trademarked good.\n\nThe Act deals with the power of the Registrar to award costs. The Registrar may award costs and direct how and by which parties they are to be paid in proceedings under the Act. By leave of the court, order for costs may be enforced in the same manner as a judgement or order of the court.\n\nPer the Act in all legal proceedings relating to a registered trade mark, registration of the trademark by the owner shall be \"prima facie\" evidence of the validity of the original registration of the trade mark and all subsequent assignments and transmission of it.\n\nThe certificate of validity. In legal proceedings, where there is an issue about the validity of the registration of a registered trademark, the court may certify validity in favour of the owner. In subsequent legal proceedings concerning validity, the owner of the trade mark is entitled to costs and expenses between legal practitioner and client on obtaining a final judgement, unless the court certifies otherwise. The orders of the Registrar are subject to judicial appeal. The Act provides the procedure for where an applicant has an option to make an application to the court or to Registrar. The application shall be made to the court if an action concerning the trademark in question is before the Court; or where the application is to the Registrar, the Registrar may refer the application to the court at any stage of the proceedings or may determine the question.\n\nA copy of any entry in the register, purporting to be certified and sealed with the official seal of the Registrar shall be admissible in a court without further proof of the original. Also, a person may obtain a certified copy of a register entry from the Registrar on payment of the prescribed fee.\n\nUnder the Act, it is provided that a person who knowingly makes or causes a false entry to be made in the register commits an offence and is fixed with the liability of summary conviction of a fine not exceeding five hundred penalty unit and a term of imprisonment not exceeding one year or both.\n\nPer the Act it is an offence to negligently make a fraudulent representation for the purpose of falsely representing a trademark as registered, or that a partly registered trademark is separately registered as a Trademark or that a registered trademark is registered in respect of specific goods or that a registered trademark gives an exclusive right to use taking into account the limitations entered on the register. The offender shall be liable to imprisonment, fine or both. However, the continuance of offence attract a further fine for each day during this continuation. \n\nIn the USA first successful fraud case of \"In Re Bose Cooperation\". Hexwave Inc, filed a use-based application to register the mark Hexwave, for a variety of electronic goods it claimed to be using in commerce. Bose corporation (“Bose”) opposed Hexwave's application based on fraud and likelihood of confusion with Bose’s registered WAVE Mark for a variety of electronic goods. Hexwave filed a counterclaim to cancel Bose’s registration on grounds of fraud and furnished evidence in this regard. Bose insisted that its renewal application was based on its honest, good faith belief that its receipt, repair and return of its previously sold audio tape recorder and players bearing wave Mark was sufficient to support its renewal application. The court held that trademark was obtained, procured or maintained fraudulently when an applicant or registrant makes false, material representation of fact in connection with a trademark application or registration with the intent to deceive the patent and trademark office. \n\nThe Act also prevents the use of reserved items such as badges, seals, devices, emblems or a flag for the use of the State or an apparatus of the State in a manner that leads or is likely to lead to the belief that that person is authorised to use such reserved items without lawful authority. \n\nTwo or more persons may be registered as a joint proprietor of a trademark, and shall apply as if those rights were vested in a single person but the right of the person who registered as joint owner can be infringed by any of the other owners who uses the trademark in respect of which the trademark is registered under which both or all of the joint owner have not been connected in course of trade. And also do not authorise the registration of two or more persons who use a trademark independently or propose to use it independently to be registered as joint owner.\n\nUnder this provision, no notice shall be entered in the register of a trust express, implied or constructive and the registrar shall not receive notice of a trust. The enforcement of equity in respect of a trademark may be enforced in the same manner as any other movable property.\n\nAn offence committed by body of persons which may include a body corporate other than a partnership, every director, manager, secretary or other officer of similar status of that body corporate shall be deemed to have committed that offence; and in the case of a partnership, every partner or officer of similar status shall be deemed to have committed that offence.\n\nThis Schedule incorporated Article 4 of the Paris Convention into the Act\n\nThis part of the Schedule provides the standard form for a notice of fraudulent mark.\n\nThe Madrid System is a convenient and cost-effective solution for registering and managing trademarks worldwide. Ghana has made a declaration by incorporating some articles of the Madrid Protocol into the Amendment.\n\nhttp://rgd.gov.gh/index.php/services/intellectual-property/trademark-registration/\n\nhttp://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/gh/gh013en.pdf\n"}
