The enrollment infrastructure allows collecting and maintaining a database of the biometric templates for all voters.\n\nA biometric voting project might include introducing biometric registration kits for enrolment of voters; using electronic voter identification devices before and on Election Day; issuing of voter identification documents (i.e. biometric voter cards), among others. The chronological stages for adopting a biometric voting registration project usually include assessment; feasibility studies; securing funding; reviewing legislation; doing pilot projects and mock registration exercises; procurement; distribution of equipment, installation, and testing; recruitment and training of staff; voter information; deployment and, post-election audits.\n\nThe final aim of implementing biometric election technology is achieving de-duplication of the voting register, thus preventing multiple voter registration and multiple voting; improving identification of the voter at the polling station, and mitigating the incidence of voter fraud (e.g. buy/rent of voters IDs before an election).\n\nHowever, it is vital that commissions carrying out these election projects first and foremost guarantee that the legal framework supports biometric voter identification, and then that the data captured during the registration process will be secured while maintaining two basic requirements: personalization and privacy. Likewise, it is imperative to have contingency mechanisms in place, in case biometric systems malfunction. One of the main challenges is to ensure that given the eventualities of technological hitches and failures, not a single voter is disenfranchised.\n\nAccording to International IDEA's ICTs in Elections Database, as of 2016, the number of countries adopting biometrics in elections has steadily increased to over 50, with significant differences between regions. \"While there are virtually no users in Europe, about half of the countries in Africa and Latin America use this technology in elections.\" 35 per cent of over 130 surveyed Electoral Management Bodies is capturing biometric data (such as fingerprints or photos) as part of their voter registration process (2016).\n\nCountries which have used Biometric voting registration include Armenia, Angola, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Bolivia, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Cameroon, Chad, Colombia, Comoros, Congo (Democratic Republic of), Costa Rica, Cote d'Ivoire, Dominican Republic, Fiji, Gambia, Ghana, Guatemala, India, Iraq, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mexico, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Panama, Peru, The Philippines, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, Somaliland, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Uruguay, Venezuela, Yemen, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.\n\nSome promoters of biometric voting registration point out that this technology, if properly customised to the country's needs and well implemented, could offer better accessibility for citizens; help avoiding long queues and waiting times for registration and voting; add simplicity and speed to the election cycle (i.e. voter identification documents can make it easier for polling staff to verify voter details); make voters and Commissions feel confident about the quality of their registry (more accurate, reliable and complete data); improve e-voting security, considerably reduce or eliminate multiple registration and multiple voting, while mitigating the risk of impersonation, identity theft, the misuse of records of deceased voters, carousel voting and ballot-box stuffing.\n\nOn the other hand, those who criticise and disapprove the use of biometrics for voter identification maintain that using biometrics for election purposes raises concerns over voters' privacy, human dignity and governmental disclosure of personal information. Some critics go further to claim that biometrics in voting poses a serious threat to democracy, due to fears of violation of the secrecy of the vote (or correlation voter-vote).\n\nThe concerns as with any other application of biometrics for identification and authentication can be manifold. There is, for example, the possibility of voter disenfranchisement when characteristics typically used to identify or verify voters might become unavailable (e.g. bandaged finger, loss of a finger, failure to acquire due to dirt or fingerprint quality degradation). Similarly, there are also claims of potential logistical and procedural \"new problems\" that biometric identification devices can bring to an election cycle: increasing costs (initial purchase costs of biometric readers and infrastructure, costs linked to maintenance, storage and upgrades) and resources' allocation (human, time, material); additional training of commissions and polling staff, technological failures that could disenfranchise voters; and extra data storage that demands higher security.\n\n"}

The CNMS is one of five DOE NSRCs that form an integrated national user network. Each NSRC is associated with other major national research facilities at one of DOE’s National Laboratories, enabling their application to nanoscale science and technology.\nTo accomplish this, the CNMS integrates nanoscale science with three highly synergistic national needs: \n\nResearch in the CNMS is organized under seven related scientific themes and a Nanofabrication Research Laboratory, (NRL; clean room), that have been selected to address grand challenges to scientific understanding as well as nanotechnology opportunities and needs. \n\n\nThe CNMS is housed in a new 80,000-ft2 building on Chestnut Ridge adjacent to the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS). Construction of the CNMS facility began in August 2003 and was completed in April 2005, with the nanoscience user research program beginning operation in October 2005. The four-level main building comprises wet and dry laboratories, office space, and common areas to promote interaction among staff, long-term research guests, and users. It is equipped with a wide range of specialized tools for synthesis, characterization, and integration of hard and soft materials. The 10,000-ft2 Nanofabrication Research Laboratory, housed in a one-level wing of the building, includes clean rooms and an area designed to meet the requirements of electron beam imaging and writing instruments (low electromagnetic field, low vibration, low acoustic noise). The Nanomaterials Theory Institute provides collaborative workspaces, visualization equipment, and high-speed connections to the terascale computing facilities of ORNL’s National Center for Computational Sciences and the national Leadership Scientific Computing Facility. The intense neutron beams of the SNS and of the recently upgraded High Flux Isotope Reactor afford unique opportunities for fundamental studies of the structure and dynamics of nanoscale materials. The CNMS will provide a gateway to these and other ORNL user facilities, including electron microscopy, for users whose research can benefit from access to multiple facilities.\n\nThe CNMS user program provides access to equipment for nanoscale research and engineering. Access is through brief user research proposals that are peer-reviewed by an external Proposal Review Committee. Nanoscience user activities were initiated during 2003, prior to completion of the CNMS building, with the first CNMS \"Jump Start\" Call for Proposals (July-August 2003).\n\n"}

It reformed the services available to deprived children, consolidating existing childcare legislation and establishing departments “in which professional social work practice would develop in child care and, in due course, in work with families.” The Act made it clear that it was the duty of local authorities to receive into care any child who was without parents or whose parents could not care for him for any reason, if it was in the interest of the child’s welfare. \n\nThe new duties imposed upon local authorities by the legislation (particularly to receive deprived children into care) resulted in childcare services working more closely with families. The Act also led to a new approach towards parent-child relations, encouraging the newly established Children’s Departments ‘to view children as individual human beings with both shared and individualised needs, rather than an indistinct mass.”\n"}
{"id": "23936472", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23936472", "title": "Clerk of Assize", "text": "Clerk of Assize\n\nA Clerk of Assize was a clerk of the Assize Courts of England and Wales, a position which existed from at least 1285 to 1971, when the Courts Act 1971 eliminated the Assize Courts. Originally the judges' private clerks tasked with enrolling pleas, the Clerks grew into the heads of administrative departments tasked with keeping each Assize running smoothly, and at one point sat as judges in their own right.\n\nThe first known reference to Clerks of Assize was made in 1285, when a procedural rule was created stating that justices on Assize should be accompanied by a clerk tasked with enrolling pleas. The first few sets of Assize Clerks were the private clerks of the judges themselves, but by 1380 records show that the Western Circuit had a permanent employed Clerk, Simon of Lichfield, a barrister of the Old Temple. From then onwards the position was normally filled by barristers. Although a 1541 statute prohibited a Clerk from actively practising as a barrister while serving, the position offered a chance to make connections with the Westminster judges and of power in local politics, and records show that in 1657 the Oxford Circuit clerkship, for example, changed hands for the then-massive sum of £2,575.\n\nThe clerks' income was initially the fees paid by parties to have a case come before the court, and as a result their pay depended on the business of the court itself. By the 1650s there were over 100 \"nisi prius\" cases on each Circuit, worth approximately 10s in fees, along with 50 criminal cases worth between 2s to 16s. Clerks were expected to pay for the expenses of the judge and the bailiff and Marshall's fees, but despite this still prospered: by the 1660s some were making more money than the Assize judges themselves. The Clerk positions eventually ceased to exist in 1971, when the Courts Act 1971 eliminated the Assize Courts.\n\nClerks were initially tasked only with drafting and accepting pleas, but for a period from the late 16th to mid 17th centuries they worked as full-fledged Assize judges to cut down the workload. They eventually headed up an entire department of administrators to keep the Assize running smoothly, and manuals written for Clerks in the late 17th century attest to the complexity of their duties, which only ended when every assize plea had been written, accepted and filed. Little is known about their assistants: almost all were legally trained, but their duties and identities remain unknown. Assistants were appointed by the Clerk, with the approval of the Assize Judges.\n\nWhen a barrister became a clerk he was statutorily debarred from acting as a barrister. Exceptions were occasionally made: at the 1682 Bedford Assize John Luke, the Clerk, represented Robert Chambers for an unspecified offence.\n"}
{"id": "54224455", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54224455", "title": "Collective work (France)", "text": "Collective work (France)\n\nA collective work under the copyright law of France is a collective work that contains the works of several authors created, assembled, harmonized and published under the direction of a person or organization who owns the commercial and moral rights of the work as a whole. \nThe work as a whole is distinct from the individual contributions, which are owned by the authors.\nIt is common for publication of articles on the Internet, in a different context and layout from the printed work, to be considered to be outside the standard agreement between the author and the owner of the collective work.\n\nArticle L113-2 of the French Intellectual Property Code defines three types of multi-author works:\n\nArticle L113-5 states that \"A collective work shall be the property, unless proved otherwise, of the natural or legal person under whose name it has been disclosed. The author’s rights shall vest in such person.\"\nArticle L123-3 states that \"In the case of pseudonymous, anonymous or collective works, the term of the exclusive right shall be 70 years from January 1 of the calendar year following that in which the work was published.\"\n\nThe concept of a collective work (\"œuvre collective\") in French law is complicated and unclear, and case law and scholarly views do not always agree.\nBernard Edelman, in his \"l’œuvre collective : une définition introuvable\" (1998), describes the legal definition of collective works as \"obscure and tangled\".\nHowever, all authorities agree that the concept of an \"oeuvre collective\" in France covers dictionaries, encyclopaedias and periodical\nworks such as newspapers or magazines.\nCourts have also ruled that collective works may include such things as the elements of a car body, a computer program, a poster and a guide of administrative formalities.\n\nBasic conditions for a collective work are that there must be a promoter, presenter or orchestrator, and the work must not be joint authorship.\nThe work's \"maître\", a natural or legal person, directs creation of the collective work, harmonizes the contributions, edits, publishes and discloses the work.\nThe \"maître\" decides on the theme, treatment and spirit of the work, assembles the contributions, harmonizes it and publishes the overall work. \nThe contributors have not significantly cooperated in creating the overall work, but have each worked independently under the direction of the \"maître\".\nIt does not matter whether the contributors are identified or remain anonymous.\n\nIn a 1999 dispute over the rights of the daily newspaper Le Progrès to publish articles online, the lower court refused to designate Le Progrès a collective work, but the Court of Appeal ruled that it was a collective work by virtue of assembling a newspaper in several editions, selecting and presenting the contributions at the sole discretion of the owner, Groupe Progrès.\nBy working under the direction of the owner, the contributors lose their creative independence, however important their contributions are to the collective work.\n\nA collective work is unusual in French law in that a juristic person may be the initial owner of a work without having to show evidence that the copyright was assigned.\nAs a rule, French courts do not recognise that an employee has transferred their rights to an employer unless there is evidence of such a transfer in the form of an agreement.\nA collective work is an exception.\nThe \"maître\" takes all the ownership rights in a collective work, and these rights are directly vested in the \"maître\" rather than transferred from the contributors, as long as the \"maître\" directed the creative process enough for it to be considered a collective work.\n\nThe 1885 Berne Convention stated that journalists owned their work, but this depends on whether a newspaper is seen as a collection of works or as a collective work.\nIn France, journalists own their work in either case.\nArticle L121-8 states that whether or not a newspaper or periodical is considered to be a collective work the journalists retain the rights to exploit their contributions.\nThe promoter is the sole owner of the rights in the collective work as a whole, but the contributors have author rights in their own contributions.\nCase law has determined that the investor's initial right of property is limited to the first commercial release of the collective work.\nThe contributors can then commercialize their contributions separately as long as this does not adversely affect commercialization of the collective work as a whole.\nThe contributors to a newspaper thus have the right to separately publish a thematic selection of articles without infringing the rights of the owner of the collective work.\n\nMoral rights are seen as personality rights in French law, attached to the personality of the author and inalienable.\nThey are retained by the author even when the patrimonial rights are sold.\nThe Intellectual Property Code says the \"maître\" has the author's rights, and does not distinguish between moral and economic rights.\nHowever, only a natural person can be an author, and moral rights cannot be alienated from the author, giving rise to uncertainty over whether the \"maître\" could claim any moral rights in the collective work.\nHowever, in a 22 March 2012 decision the French Supreme Court (\"Cour de cassation\") reversed the decision of a lower court and stated that \"the natural or legal person at the initiative of a collective work is vested with the author's rights over this work and, in particular, the moral rights prerogatives\".\nThe owner of the collective work may not be a natural person, so they are not an author in the strict sense, but they own the moral rights as well as the economic rights, and may therefore prohibit violations of their moral rights such as distortion of the collective work.\n\nEach contributor to the collective work retains the moral rights to their contribution, and may enforce this right against third parties or against the \"maître\" if they make unauthorized changes to the contribution. \nDespite this, the \"maître\" may modify the contributions as far as is needed to harmonize them with the collective work as a whole.\nThe moral right of the contributor is limited by the fusion of their contribution with those of the other co-authors.\n\nThe rise of the Internet has opened new questions about the rights of the authors of contributions to a collective work.\nWhen a newspaper is reproduced in its entirety the reproduction falls under the collective work regime.\nPublication in successive editions of a newspaper during the course of the day, each of which reproduces a large part of the previous edition, is not seen as publication in another newspaper.\nElectronic publication of the entire newspaper could therefore be seen as an edition of the same collective work.\nHowever, partial or selective reproduction may require the agreement of the contributors.\n\nAs an example of digital reproduction of the full work, since 2005 the Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF) has been digitizing editions of daily and weekly periodicals that were published before 1943. Some of this has been through agreements with the publishers \"L’Ouest-Éclair\" and \"Le Monde diplomatique\". \nWhere the BnF does not have such an agreement, the BnF considers the newspaper to be a collective work that entered the public domain 70 years after publication.\nSome of these digitized journals may contain contributions for which the individual author's rights have not expired.\nThus the cover of the digitized \"\" of 2 December 1915 has an illustration by the artist , who died in 1962 and whose rights would not expire until 2033.\n\nFrance was the first country to introduce an online newspaper, with the Minitel service in the 1980s.\nToday the online and print versions of newspaper are typically run by different departments and have different appearance, with the online versions updated frequently and providing video boxes and interactive features. Some newspapers are online only.\nA case between the French national union of journalists and \"Le Figaro\" newspaper was heard on 14 April 1999 by the Court of First Instance in Paris.\n\"Le Figaro\" had created a website where articles by the journalists could be consulted online.\nThe court ruled that although the printed newspaper was a collective work, the rights of the journalists concerning their articles had been infringed.\n\"Le Figaro\" only had the right to publish the articles in the printed newspaper, and the website would be considered another newspaper or magazine.\n\nOn 9 December 1999 the Lyon Court of Appeal ruled similarly that the daily newspaper \"Le Progrès\" was guilty of forgery for having published its journalists' articles on the internet.\nAlthough the newspaper was a collective work, the right of the owner to reproduction was limited to the paper edition, and the website could not be seen as an extension of that edition.\nA similar judgement was issued by the Court of Cassation on 3 July 2013 in a case concerning the newspaper \"L'Union\".\nThe court said that whether or not that newspaper was a collective work, which had not been proven, the consent of a contributor was required before his contributions could be reproduced on an Internet site and reproduced in another newspaper.\n\nNewspapers have responded by signing agreements with journalist's unions that took different approaches to cover online publication of articles.\n\"Les Derniéres Nouvelles d'Alsace\" paid journalists for online use. \n\"Le Monde\" compensated journalists for ceding their copyright. \n\"Les Échos\" made an agreement that treated the print and online versions as one.\n\n"}
{"id": "194261", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=194261", "title": "Common-law marriage", "text": "Common-law marriage\n\nCommon-law marriage, also known as \"sui iuris\" marriage, informal marriage, marriage by habit and repute, or marriage in fact, is a legal framework in a limited number of jurisdictions where a couple is legally considered married, without that couple having formally registered their relation as a civil or religious marriage. The original concept of a \"common-law marriage\" is a marriage that is considered valid by both partners, but has not been formally recorded with a state or religious registry, or celebrated in a formal religious service. In effect, the act of the couple representing themselves to others as being married, and organizing their relation as if they were married, acts as the evidence that they are married.\n\nThe term \"common-law marriage\" has wide informal use, often to denote relations that are not legally recognized as common-law marriages. The term \"common-law marriage\" is often used colloquially or by the media to refer to cohabiting couples, regardless of any legal rights that these couples may or may not have, which can create public confusion both in regard to the term and in regard to the legal rights of unmarried partners.\n\nThe term \"common-law marriage\" is often used incorrectly to describe various types of couple relationships, such as cohabitation (whether or not registered), or other legally formalized relations. Although these interpersonal relationships are often called \"common-law marriage\" they differ from \"true\" common-law marriage, in that they are not legally recognized as \"marriages\", but are a parallel interpersonal status, known in most jurisdictions as \"domestic partnership\", \"registered partnership\", \"conjugal union\", \"civil union\", etc. In Canada, for instance, while couples in \"marriage-like relationships\" may have many of the rights and responsibilities of a marriage (laws vary by province), couples in such partnerships are not legally considered married, although they may be legally defined as \"unmarried spouses\" and for many purposes (such as taxes, financial claims, etc.) they are treated as if they were married. In recent years, the term \"common-law marriage\" has gained increased use as a generic term for all unmarried couples – however, this term has a narrow legal meaning. First of all, one can only talk of \"common-law marriage\" if such marriage was formed in a jurisdiction which actually applies the common law. A 2008 poll in the UK showed that 51% of respondents incorrectly believed that cohabitants had the same rights as married couples.\n\nNon-marital relationship contracts are not necessarily recognized from one jurisdiction to another, and neither are \"de facto\" couples, whereas common-law marriages, being a legal marriage, are valid marriages worldwide (if the parties complied with the requirements to form a valid marriage while living in a jurisdiction that allows this form of marriage to be contracted).\n\nCommon-law and statutory marriage have the following characteristics in common:\n\n\nOtherwise, common-law marriage differs from statutory marriage as follows:\n\n\nIn ancient Greek and Roman civilization, marriages were private agreements between individuals and families. Community recognition of a marriage was largely what qualified it as a marriage. The state had only limited interests in assessing the legitimacy of marriages. Normally civil and religious officials took no part in marriage ceremonies, nor did they keep registries. There were several more or less formal ceremonies to choose from (partly interchangeable, but sometimes with different legal ramifications) as well as informal arrangements. It was relatively common for couples to cohabit with no ceremony; cohabiting for a moderate period of time was sufficient to make it a marriage. Cohabiting for the purpose of marriage carried with it no social stigma.\n\nIn medieval Europe, marriage came under the jurisdiction of canon law, which recognized as a valid marriage one where the parties stated that they took one another as wife and husband, even in absence of any witnesses.\n\nThe Catholic Church forbade clandestine marriage at the Fourth Lateran Council (1215), which required all marriages to be announced in a church by a priest. The Council of Trent (1545–1563) introduced more specific requirements, ruling that in the future a marriage would be valid only if witnessed by the pastor of the parish or the local ordinary (i.e., the bishop of the diocese), or by the delegate of one of said witnesses, the marriage being invalid otherwise, even if witnessed by a Catholic priest. The Tridentine canons did not bind the Protestants or the Eastern Orthodox, but clandestine marriage was impossible for the latter, since marriage required the presence of a priest for validity. England abolished clandestine or common-law marriages in the Marriage Act 1753, requiring marriages to be performed by a priest of the Church of England unless the participants in the marriage were Jews or Quakers. The Act applied to Wales. The Act did not apply to Scotland because by the Acts of Union 1707 Scotland retained its own legal system. To get around the requirements of the Marriage Act, such as minimum age requirements, couples would go to Gretna Green in southern Scotland, or other border villages such as Coldstream, to get married under Scots law.\n\nMarriages \"per verba de praesenti\", sometimes known as common-law marriages, were an agreement to marry, rather than a marriage.\n\nThe Marriage Act of 1753 also did not apply to Britain's overseas colonies of the time, so common-law marriages continued to be recognized in the future United States and Canada. All other European jurisdictions have long abolished \"marriage by habit and repute\", Scotland became the last to do so in 2006.\n\nIn Australia the term \"de facto relationship\" is often used to refer to relationships between any two persons who are not married, but are effectively living in certain domestic circumstances. Since March 1, 2009 de facto relationships have been recognized in the Family Law Act (Commonwealth), applicable in states that have referred their jurisdiction on de facto couples to the Commonwealth's jurisdiction. In Western Australia, the only state that has not referred its jurisdiction, state legislation is still valid. There is also no federal recognition of de facto relationships existing outside of Australia (see Section 51(xxxvii) of the Australian Constitution), and so this is also a state matter.\n\nThe legal term for such relationships varies by state and territory; however, \"common-law marriage\" is not used anywhere in Australia.\nAlthough property aspects of these relationships are dealt with under state law, the law relating to children of such relationships is contained in the federal \"Family Law Act 1975\". Most laws dealing with taxation, social welfare, pensions, etc., treat de facto marriages in the same manner as solemnized marriages.\n\nThe Family Law Act states that a de facto relationship can exist between two people of different or the same sex and that a person can be in a de facto relationship even if legally married to another person or in a de facto relationship with someone else. Family property laws, however, are excepted from jurisdiction when a person is both married and in a de facto relationship at the same time. This exception is due to federal polygamy laws. Same-sex de facto relationships have been recognized in New South Wales since 1999. There are a number of methods by which these relationships are recognized in Australian law and they include the same entitlements as \"de jure\" marriage.\n\nThe federal \"Marriage Act 1961\" provides for marriage, but does not recognize 'common-law marriages'. Since midnight 9 January, 2018 same-sex marriage became legally effective throughout Australia.\n\nCanada does not have true common-law marriage (as in parts of the US), although common-law \"relationships\" are recognized for certain purposes across Canada. In Canada, the legal definition and many implications of marriage-like relationships fall under provincial jurisdiction. The term \"common law\" appears informally in documents from the federal government.\n\nCitizenship & Immigration Canada states that a common-law partner refers to a person who is living in a conjugal relationship with another person (opposite or same sex), and has done so continuously for a period of at least one year. A conjugal relationship exists when there is a significant degree of commitment between two people. This can be shown with evidence that the couple share the same home, that they support each other financially and emotionally, that they have children together, or that they present themselves in public as a couple. Common-law partners who are unable to live together or appear in public together because of legal restrictions in their home country or who have been separated for reasons beyond their control (for example, civil war or armed conflict) may still qualify and should be included on an application.\n\nCanada Revenue Agency (CRA) states, as of 2007, a common-law relationship is true if at least one of the following applies:\n\n\nThe complete CRA definitions for marital status is available.\n\nIn many cases, couples in marriage-like relationships have the same rights as married couples under federal law. Various federal laws include \"common-law status\", which automatically takes effect when two people (of any gender) have lived together in a conjugal relationship for five full years. Common-law partners may be eligible for various federal government spousal benefits. As family law varies between provinces, there are differences between the provinces regarding the recognition of common-law relationship. No province other than Saskatchewan and British Columbia sanctions married persons to be capable in family law of having more than one recognized partner at the same time.\n\nIn 1999, after the court case \"M. v. H.\", the Supreme Court of Canada decided that same-sex partners would also be included in common-law relationships. In Saskatchewan, Queen's Bench justices have sanctioned common-law relationships as simultaneously existing in Family law while one or more of the spouses were also civilly married to others.\n\nIn Ontario, the Ontario Family Law Act specifically recognizes common-law spouses in section 29, dealing with spousal support issues; the requirements are living together continuously for no less than three years or having a child in common and having \"cohabited in a relationship of some permanence\". The three years must be continuous, although a breakup of a few days during the period will not affect a person's status as common law.\n\nMarried people may also have a recognized common-law spouse even before being divorced from the first spouse.\n\nHowever, common-law spouses do not have automatic rights under the \"Family Law Act\" to their spouses' property because section 29 of the Act (which extends the definition of spouses beyond those who are married) applies only to the support sections of the Act. Thus, common-law partners do not have a statutory right to divide property in a breakup, and must ask courts to look to concepts such as the constructive or resulting trust to divide property in an equitable manner between partners.\n\nAnother difference that distinguishes common-law spouses from married partners is that a common-law partner can be compelled to testify against his or her partner in a court of law.\n\nThe Civil Code of Quebec has never recognized a common-law partnership as a form of marriage. However, many laws in Quebec explicitly apply to common-law partners (called \"conjoints de fait\") in \"\"de facto\" unions\" (marriages being \"\"de jure\" unions\"), as they do to marriage spouses. Same-sex partners are also recognized as \"conjoints de fait\" in de facto unions, for the purpose of social benefit laws. However, common-law partners do not have any legal rights between them, such as alimony, family patrimony, compensatory allowance and matrimonial regime. The Quebec Court of Appeal ruled this restriction to be unconstitutional in 2010; and on January 25, 2013 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that common-law couples do not have the same rights as married couple.\n\nA 2002 amendment to the Civil Code, recognizes a type of domestic partnership called a civil union that is similar to marriage and is likewise available to same-sex partners. No citizen of Quebec can be recognized under family law to be in both a civilly married state and a \"conjoints de fait\" within the same time frame. Divorce from one conjugal relationship must occur before another conjugal relationship may occur in family law.\n\nSame-sex partners can also marry legally in Quebec, as elsewhere in Canada.\n\nThe term \"common-law marriage\" does not appear in BC law. A distinction is made between being a \"spouse\" and being \"married\". Married couples include only those who have engaged in a legal marriage ceremony and have received a marriage licence. \"Spouses\" include married couples as well as those, of same or opposite gender, who satisfy criteria for being in a \"marriage-like relationship\" for a time period that depends on the law that is being considered. Hence the meaning of the term \"unmarried spouse\" in BC depends on the legal context. The criteria for a relationship being accepted as \"marriage-like\" include cohabitation for at least the specified period, unbroken by excessively long intervals that are unexplained by exigent circumstances. If dispute arises about whether the relationship was \"marriage-like\", a court would consider a comprehensive set of further criteria including the domestic and financial arrangements, degree and nature of intimacy, and the sense of the relationship presented to friends and families (especially by each spouse to his/her own family). \"Mere roommates will never qualify as unmarried spouses. There needs to be some other dimension to the relationship indicative of a commitment between the parties and their shared belief that they are in a special relationship with each other.\" The criteria do not exclude the existence of a previous marriage to a third person during the period of the \"marriage-like relationship\" of the unmarried spouses. Hence a person may have more than one spouse at the same time.\n\nThe implications of becoming an unmarried spouse include:\n\n\nThe requirements in some other provinces are as follows:\n\n\nIn Israel, courts and a few statutes (such as social security which grants death and disability benefits) have recognized an institute of \"yeduim batsibur\" () meaning a couple who are \"known in the public\" (lit. translation) as living together as husband and wife. Generally speaking the couple needs to satisfy two tests which are: 1) \"intimate life similar to married couple, relationship based on same emotions of affection and love, dedication and faithfulness, showing they have chosen to share their fate\" (Supreme Court of Israel, judge (intimacy test)), and 2) sharing household (economic test). In addition courts usually are more likely to recognize such relationship as marriage for granting benefits if the couple could not get married under the Israeli law.\nIreland does not recognize common-law marriage, but the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 gives some rights to unmarried cohabitants.\n\nIn the Netherlands a couple can sign a samenlevingscontract (cohabitation agreement). This is also commonly done by couples who don't want to get married legally.\n\nThe term \"common-law marriage\" has been used in England and Wales to refer to unmarried, cohabiting heterosexual relationships. However, this is merely a social usage. The term does not confer on cohabiting parties any of the rights or obligations enjoyed by spouses or civil partners. Unmarried partners are recognised for certain purposes in legislation: e.g., for means-tested benefits. For example, in the Jobseekers Act 1995, \"unmarried couple\" was defined as a man and woman who are not married to each other but who are living together in the same household as husband and wife other than in prescribed circumstances. But in many areas of the law cohabitants enjoy no special rights. Thus when a cohabiting relationship ends ownership of any assets will be decided by property law. The courts have no discretion to reallocate assets, as occurs on divorce.\n\nIt is sometimes mistakenly claimed that before the Marriage Act 1753 cohabiting couples would enjoy the protection of a \"common-law marriage\". In fact, neither the name nor the concept of \"common-law marriage\" was known at this time. Far from being treated as if they were married, couples known to be cohabiting risked prosecution by the church courts for fornication.\n\nIt is equally mistakenly claimed that couples who lived together without undergoing a marriage ceremony before the Marriage Act 1753 would be presumed to have undertaken a \"contract marriage\" by mutual consent. However, contract marriages (or more strictly contracts \"per verba de praesenti\"), were not understood as having the legal status of a valid marriage until the decision in \"Dalrymple\" in 1811. This decision affected the subsequent development of English law due to the fact that the Marriage Act 1753 did not apply overseas. English courts later held that it was possible to marry by a simple exchange of consent in the colonies although most of the disputed ceremonies involved the ministrations of a priest or other clergyman.\n\nThe English courts also upheld marriages by consent in territories not under British control but only if it had been impossible for the parties to marry according to the requirements of the local law. The late 1950s and early 1960s saw a spate of cases arising out of the Second World War, with marriages in prisoner-of-war camps in German-occupied Europe posing a particular problem for judges. (Some British civilians interned by the Japanese during the Second World War were held to be legally married after contracting marriages under circumstances where the formal requirements could not be met.) To this limited extent, English law does recognise what has become known as a \"common-law marriage\". English legal texts initially used the term to refer exclusively to \"American\" common-law marriages. Only in the 1960s did the term \"common-law marriage\" begin to be used in its contemporary sense to denote unmarried, cohabiting heterosexual relationships and not until the 1970s and 1980s did the term begin to lose its negative connotations. The use of the term is likely to have encouraged cohabiting couples to believe falsely that they enjoyed legal rights. By the end of the 1970s a myth had emerged that marrying made little difference to one’s legal rights, and this fuelled the subsequent increase in the number of couples living together and having children together outside marriage.\n\nUnder Scots law, there have been several forms of \"irregular marriage\", among them:\n\n\nThe Marriage (Scotland) Act 1939 provided that the first three forms of irregular marriage could not be formed on or after 1 January 1940. However, any irregular marriages contracted prior to 1940 can still be upheld. This act also allowed the creation of regular civil marriages in Scotland for the first time. (The civil-registration system started in Scotland on 1 January 1855.)\n\nUntil this act, the only regular marriage available in Scotland was a religious marriage. Irregular marriages were not socially accepted and many people who decided to contract them did so where they were relatively unknown. In some years up to 60% of the marriages in the Blythswood Registration District of Glasgow were \"irregular\".\n\nIn 2006, \"marriage by cohabitation with habit and repute\", the last form of irregular marriage that could still be contracted in Scotland, was abolished in the Family Law (Scotland) Act 2006. Until that act had come into force, Scotland remained the only European jurisdiction never to have totally abolished the old-style common-law marriage. For this law to apply, the minimum time the couple have lived together continuously had to exceed 20 days.\n\nAs in the American jurisdictions that have preserved it, this type of marriage can be difficult to prove. It is not enough for the couple to have lived together for several years, but they must have been generally regarded as husband and wife. Their friends and neighbors, for example, must have known them as Mr. and Mrs. So-and-so (or at least they must have held themselves out to their neighbors and friends as Mr. and Mrs. So-and-so). Also, like American common-law marriages, it is a form of lawful marriage, so that people cannot be common-law spouses, or husband and wife by cohabitation with habit and repute, if one of them was legally married to somebody else when the relationship began.\n\nIt is a testament to the influence of American legal thought and English colloquial usage that, in a study conducted by the Scottish Executive in 2000, 57% of Scots surveyed believed that couples who merely live together have a \"common-law marriage\". In fact, that term is unknown in Scots law, which uses \"marriage by cohabitation with habit and repute\". \"Common-law marriage\" is an American term.\n\nOtherwise, men and women who otherwise behave as husband and wife do \"not\" have a common-law marriage or a marriage by habit and repute merely because they set up housekeeping together, but they \"must\" hold themselves out to the world as husband and wife. (In many jurisdictions, they must do so for a certain length of time for the marriage to be valid.) The Scottish Survey is not clear on these points. It notes that \"common-law marriage\" is not part of Scots law, but it fails to note that \"marriage by cohabitation with habit and repute\", which is the same thing but in name, \"was\" part of Scots law until 2006.\n\nIn the United States, common-law marriage can be contracted in eight states and the District of Columbia. Once they meet the requirements of common-law marriage, couples in those true common-law marriages are considered legally married for all purposes and in all circumstances.\n\nCommon-law marriage can still be contracted in Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, and the District of Columbia. Common law marriage may also be valid under military law for purposes of a bigamy prosecution under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\n\nAll U.S. jurisdictions recognize common-law marriages that were validly contracted in the originating jurisdiction, because they are valid marriages in the jurisdiction where they were contracted. see: Full Faith and Credit Clause. However, absent legal registration or similar notice of the marriage, the parties to a common law marriage or their eventual heirs may have difficulty proving their relationship to be marriage. Some states provide for registration of an informal or common-law marriage based on the declaration of each of the spouses on a state-issued form.\n\nDue to their colonial past, the islands of the English-speaking Caribbean have statutes concerning common-law marriage similar to those in England. However, in the Caribbean, the term \"common-law\" marriage is also widely described, by custom as much as by law, to any long term relationship between male and female partners. Such unions are widespread, making up a significant percentage of the families many of which have children and may last for many years. The reasons for people choosing common-law arrangements is debated in sociological literature. Although the acceptance of this type of union varies, men being more inclined to consider them as legitimate than women, they have become an institution.\n\n"}
{"id": "123443", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=123443", "title": "Death squad", "text": "Death squad\n\nA death squad is an armed group that conducts extrajudicial killings or forced disappearances of persons for the purposes such as political repression, assassinations, torture, genocide, ethnic cleansing, or revolutionary terror. These killings are often conducted in ways meant to ensure the secrecy of the killers' identities. Death squads may have the support of domestic or foreign governments (see state terrorism). They may comprise a secret police force, paramilitary militia groups, government soldiers, policemen, or combinations thereof. They may also be organized as vigilantes. When death squads are not controlled by the state, they may consist of insurgent forces or organized crime, such as the ones used by Mexican cartels.\n\n\"Einsatzgruppen\" were paramilitary death squads created by Nazi Germany during the Holocaust. These groups were mainly made up of police officers who killed more than two million people, including 1.3 million Jews.\n\nAlthough the term \"death squad\" did not rise to notoriety until the activities of such groups became widely known in Central and South America during the 1970s and 80s, death squads have been employed under different guises throughout history. Apparently, the term was first used by the fascist Iron Guard in Romania. It officially installed Iron guard death squads in 1936 in order to kill political enemies. It was also used during the Battle of Algiers by Paul Aussaresses.\n\nIn Latin America, death squads first appeared in Brazil where a group called \"Esquadrão da Morte\" (literally \"Death Squad\") emerged in the 1960s; they subsequently spread to Argentina and Chile in the 1970s, and they were later used in Central America during the 1980s. Argentina used extrajudicial killings as way of crushing the liberal and communist opposition to the military junta during the 'Dirty War' of the 1970s. For example, Alianza Anticomunista Argentina was a far-right death squad mainly active during the \"Dirty War\". The Chilean military regime of 1973–1990 also committed such killings. See Operation Condor for examples.\n\nDuring the Salvadoran civil war, death squads achieved notoriety on March 24, 1980, when a sniper assassinated Archbishop Óscar Romero as he said Mass inside a convent chapel. In December 1980, three American nuns, Ita Ford, Dorothy Kazel, and Maura Clarke, and a lay worker, Jean Donovan, were gang raped and murdered by a military unit later found to have been acting on specific orders. Death squads were instrumental in killing hundreds of real and suspected Communists. Priests who were spreading liberation theology, such as Father Rutilio Grande, were often targeted as well. The murderers were found to have been soldiers of the Salvadoran military, which was receiving U.S. funding and military advisors during the Carter administration. These events prompted outrage in the U.S. and led to a temporary cutoff in military aid at the end of his presidency. Death Squad activity stretched well into the Reagan years (1981–1989) as well. \n\nHonduras also had death squads active through the 1980s, the most notorious of which was the army unit Battalion 316. Hundreds of people, teachers, politicians, and union bosses were assassinated by government-backed forces. Battalion 316 received substantial training from the United States Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, extrajudicial killings were conducted by both sides during the Vietnam War. For example, Viet Cong member Nguyễn Văn Lém, famous for being extrajudicially executed on camera by General Nguyễn Ngọc Loan on 1 February 1968 in Saigon, was himself later claimed to have commanded a death squad targeting South Vietnamese policemen and their families during the Tet Offensive in Saigon.\n\n, death squads have continued to be active in several locations, including Chechnya, Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic, Nigeria, Colombia, Iraq, Yemen, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, South Sudan, Syria, Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Philippines among others.\n\nDeath squads are reportedly active in this country.\n\nThis has been condemned by the US but appears to be difficult to stop. Moreover, there is no proof as to whom is behind the killings\n\nIn an interview with the panafrican magazine \"Jeune Afrique\", Laurent Gbagbo accused one of the opposition leaders, Alassane Ouattara (ADO), to be the main organizer of the media frenzy around his wife's involvement in the killing squads. He also successfully sued and won, in French courts, in cases against the French newspapers that made the accusations.\n\nIn December 2014, Kenyan Anti-Terrorism Police Unit officers confessed to Al-Jazeera that they were responsible for almost 500 of the extrajudicial killings. The murders reportedly totaled several hundred homicides every year. They included the assassination of Abubaker Shariff Ahmed \"Makaburi\", an Al-Shabaab associate from Kenya, who was among 21 Muslim radicals allegedly murdered by the Kenyan police since 2012. According to the agents, they resorted to killing after the Kenyan police could not successfully prosecute terror suspects. In doing so, the officers indicated that they were acting on the direct orders of Kenya's National Security Council, which consisted of the Kenyan President, Deputy President, Chief of the Defence Forces, Inspector General of Police, National Security Intelligence Service Director, Cabinet Secretary of Interior, and Principal Secretary of Interior. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta and the National Security Council of Kenya members denied operating an extrajudicial assassination program. Additionally, the officers suggested that Western security agencies provided intelligence for the program, including the whereabouts and activities of government targets. They asserted that Britain supplied further logistics in the form of equipment and training. One Kenyan officer within the Council's General Service Unit also indicated that Israeli instructors taught them how to kill. The head of the International Bar Association, Mark Ellis, cautioned that any such involvement by foreign nations would constitute a breach of international law. The United Kingdom and Israel denied participation in the Kenyan National Security Council's reported death squads, with the UK Foreign Office indicating that it had approached the Kenyan authorities over the charges.\n\nBeginning in the 1960s, the African National Congress (ANC) and its ally, the South African Communist Party (SACP), and the Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC), began a campaign to topple South Africa's National Party (NP)-controlled apartheid Government. Both the ANC's armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), and South African security forces routinely engaged in bombings and targeted killings, both at home and abroad. Particularly notorious apartheid death squads were the Civil Cooperation Bureau (CCB) and the South African Police's counter-insurgency unit C10, commanded by Colonel Eugene de Kock and based at the Vlakplaas farm west of Pretoria.\n\nAfter the end of Apartheid, death squad violence conducted by both the National Party and the ANC was investigated by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.\n\nFrom 1971 to 1979, Ugandan dictator Idi Amin set up death squads to murder enemies of the state.\n\nAfter the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo there was a paramilitary force known \"la Patrulla 42\", or just \"la 42\", that used state terrorism to deploy fear in the population. During the 12-year regime of Joaquín Balaguer, the \"Frente Democrático Anticomunista y Antiterrorista\", most known as \"la Banda Colorá\", continued the practices of \"la 42\".\n\nThe \"Tonton Macoute\" was a paramilitary force created in 1959 by Haitian dictator François \"Papa Doc\" Duvalier that murdered 30,000 to 60,000 Haitians.\n\nIn a way similar to the American Indian Wars, the early Mexican nation struggled against Apache raids. Between 1835 and 1837, only 15 years after the Mexican independence and at the midst of the Texan Revolution, the local governments of the Mexican states of Sonora and Chihuahua (that border with the U.S. states of Texas, New Mexico and Arizona ) put a bounty on the Apache bands that scourged the area. In the case of Chihuahua the bounty atracted \"bounty hunters\" from the United States, that were often Anglo Americans, runaway slaves and even from other indian tribes, it was payed based on Apache scalps, 100 pesos per warrior, 50 pesos per woman, and 25 pesos per child. As historian Donald E. Worcester wrote: \"The new policy attracted a diverse group of men, including Anglos, runaway slaves led by Seminole John Horse, and Indians — Kirker used Delawares and Shawnees; others, such as Terrazas, used Tarahumaras; and Seminole Chief Coacoochee led a band of his own people who had fled from Indian Territory.\"\n\nFor more than seven decades following the Mexican Revolution, the Mexican State was a One-party state ruled by the \"Partido Revolucionario Institucional\" (PRI). During this era, death squad tactics were routinely used against suspected enemies of the state.\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, the PRI's founder, President Plutarco Elías Calles, used death squads against Mexico's Roman Catholic majority. Calles explained his reasons in a private telegram to the Mexican Ambassador to the French Third Republic, Alberto José Pani Arteaga. \"...Catholic Church in Mexico is a political movement, and must be eliminated ... free of religious hypnotism which fools the people... within one year without the sacraments, the people will forget the faith...\"\n\nCalles and his adherents used the Mexican Army and police, as well as paramilitary forces like the Red Shirts, to abduct, torture, and execute priests, nuns, and actively religious laity. Mexican Catholics were also routinely hanged from telegraph poles along the railroad lines. Prominent victims of the Mexican State's campaign against Catholicism include the teenager Jose Sanchez del Rio, the Jesuit priest Father Miguel Pro, and the Christian Pacifist Anacleto González Flores. (see also Saints of the Cristero War).\n\nIn response, an armed revolt against the Mexican State, the Cristero War, began in 1927. Composed largely of peasant volunteers and commanded by retired General Enrique Gorostieta Velarde, the Cristeros were also responsible for atrocities. Among them were the assassination of former Mexican President Álvaro Obregón, train robberies, and violent attacks against rural teachers. The uprising largely ended after the Holy See and the Mexican State negotiated a compromise agreement. Refusing to lay down his arms despite offers of amnesty, General Gorostieta was killed in action by the Mexican Army in Jalisco on 2 June 1929. Following the cessation of hostilities, more than 5,000 Cristeros were summarily executed by Mexican security forces. The events of the Cristero War are depicted in the 2012 film \"For Greater Glory\".\n\nDuring the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, death squads continued to be used against anti-PRI activists, both Marxists and social conservatives. One example of this is the 1968 Tlatelolco massacre, in which an anti-regime protest rally was attacked by security forces in Mexico City. After this event paramilitary groups like \"Los Halcones\" (The hawks) and the \"Brigada blanca\" (White brigade) were used to attack, hunt and exterminate political dissidents.\n\nAllegations have been made by both journalists and American law enforcement of collusion between senior PRI statesmen and the Mexican drug cartels. It has even been alleged that, under PRI rule, no drug traffickers were ever successful without the permission of the Mexican State. If the same drug trafficker fell from favor, however, Mexican law enforcement would be ordered to move against their operation, as happened to Pablo Acosta Villarreal in 1987.\n\nBy the early 1990s, the PRI started to lose the grip on its absolute political power, however its corruption became so pervasive that Juarez Cartel boss Amado Carrillo Fuentes was even able to purchase a window in Mexico's air defense system. During this period, his airplanes were permitted to smuggle narcotics into the United States without the interference of the Mexican Air Force. As a result, Carillo Fuentes became known as \"The Lord of the Skies.\"\n\nIt is believed by American and Mexican investigators that the PRI would also use the cartels to commit assassinations which were too sensitive to be traced back to the ruling party. One murder believed to be an example of this is the 1993 murder of Cardinal Juan Jesús Posadas Ocampo.\n\nThe PRI also used death squad tactics against the Zapatista guerilla movement. In 1997, forty-five people were killed by a Mexican security forces in Chenalho, Chiapas.\n\nIn 2000, however, during an internal power struggle between former President Salinas and President Zedillo, the PRI was peacefully voted out from power, until 2013 when they partially regained their influence and power, only to lose again in 2018.\nIt is also alleged that, during the time they first lost the presidency, some of the most powerful PRI members were supporting and protecting drug cartels that they used as death squads against their criminal and political rivals, being this one of the real reasons the PAN party government accepted to start the Mexican drug war against the Cartels. How ever, it is also alleged that during this period of time the turmoil of war has been used by the parties in power to exterminate even more political dissidents, activists and their own rivals. An example of this is the case of the 2014 forced disappearence and assasination of 43 activist rural students from the Ayotzinapa Teachers' College, in the hands of police officers colluded with the \"Guerreros Unidos\" drug cartel.\n\nDuring the California Gold Rush, the state government between 1850 and 1859 financed and organized militia units to hunt down and kill Native Americans in the state. Between 1850 and 1852 the state appropriated almost one million dollars for the activities of these militias, and between 1854 and 1859 the state appropriated another $500,000, almost half of which was reimbursed by the federal government. These death squads were part of the reduction of the indigenous population of California from 150,000 in 1848 to just 15,000 in 1900. Some scholars contend that the state financing of these militias, as well as the US government's role in other massacres in California, such as the Bloody Island and Yontoket Massacres, in which up to 400 or more natives were killed in each massacre, constitutes acts of genocide against the native people of California.\nBeginning in the 1850s, pro-slavery Bushwhackers and anti-slavery Jayhawkers waged war against each other in the Kansas Territory. Due to the horrific atrocities committed by both sides against civilians, the territory was dubbed \"Bleeding Kansas\". After the American Civil War began, the fraternal bloodshed increased.\n\nThe most infamous atrocity in Kansas during the American Civil War is the Lawrence Massacre. A large force group of Bushwhackers led by William Clarke Quantrill and Bloody Bill Anderson attacked and burned down the pro-Union town of Lawrence, Kansas in retaliation for the Jayhawkers' earlier destruction of Osceola, Missouri. The Bushwhackers shot down nearly 150 unarmed men and boys.\n\nDuring Reconstruction, embittered Confederate veterans supported the Ku Klux Klan and similar vigilante organizations throughout the American South. The Klan and its counterparts threatened and even lynched African-Americans, northern carpetbaggers, and Southern \"scalawags\". This was often with the unofficial support of the Democratic Party leadership. Historian Bruce B. Campbell has called the KKK, \"one of the first proto-death squads\". Campbell alleges that the difference between it and modern death-squads is that the Ku Klux Klan was composed of members of a defeated regime rather than the ruling governmental. \"Otherwise, in its murderous intent, links to private elite interests, and covert nature, it very closely resembles modern death squads.\"\n\nUltimately, U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant declared a state of emergency in the American South and gave the United States Army power to break up the Klan. Some Klansmen were tried before military tribunals and hanged.\n\nIn 1915, D.W. Griffith's film \"The Birth of a Nation\" romanticized the KKK and led directly to its re-emergence at a conference at Stone Mountain, Georgia. The Klan soon had \"klaverns\" not only in the South, but also in the Midwestern states of Michigan, Minnesota, Indiana and Illinois.\n\nUnlike its counterpart, the re-constituted KKK opposed not only non-whites, but also Jews and Roman Catholics. Among its most famous victims are Father James Coyle, Medgar Evers, James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner. (see also 16th Street Baptist Church bombing).\n\nDuring the Salvadoran civil war, death squads (known in Spanish by the name of Escuadrón de la Muerte, \"Squadron of Death\") achieved notoriety when a sniper assassinated Archbishop Óscar Romero while he was saying Mass in March 1980. In December 1980, three American nuns and a lay worker were gangraped and murdered by a military unit later found to have been acting on specific orders. Death squads were instrumental in killing thousands of peasants and activists. Funding for the squads came primarily from right-wing Salvadoran businessmen and landowners. Because the death squads involved were found to have been soldiers of the Salvadoran military security forces, which were receiving U.S. arms, funding, training and advice during the Carter, Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations, these events prompted some outrage in the U.S. Human rights activists criticized U.S. administrations for denying Salvadoran government links to the death squads. Veteran Human Rights Watch researcher Cynthia J. Arnson writes that \"particularly during the years 1980–1983 when the killing was at its height (numbers of killings could reach as far as 35,000), assigning responsibility for the violence and human rights abuses was a product of the intense ideological polarization in the United States. The Reagan administration downplayed the scale of abuse as well as the involvement of state actors. Because of the level of denial, as well as the extent of U.S. involvement with the Salvadoran military and security forces, the U.S. role in El Salvador- what was known about death squads, when it was known, and what actions the United States did or did not take to curb their abuses- became an important part of El Salvador's death squad story.\". Some death squads, such as Sombra Negra, are still operating in El Salvador.\n\nThe Salvadoran Army's U.S.-trained Atlacatl Battalion was responsible for the El Mozote massacre where more than 800 civilians were murdered, over half of them children, the El Calabozo massacre, and the murders of six Jesuits in 1989.\n\nHonduras had death squads active through the 1980s, the most notorious of which was Battalion 3–16. Hundreds of people, teachers, politicians, and union bosses were assassinated by government-backed forces. Battalion 316 received substantial support and training from the United States Central Intelligence Agency. At least 19 members were School of the Americas graduates. Seven members, including Billy Joya, later played important roles in the administration of President Manuel Zelaya as of mid-2006. Following the 2009 coup d'état, former Battalion 3–16 member Nelson Willy Mejía Mejía became Director-General of Immigration and Billy Joya was \"de facto\" President Roberto Micheletti's security advisor. Another former Battalion 3–16 member, Napoleón Nassar Herrera, was high Commissioner of Police for the north-west region under Zelaya and under Micheletti, and also became a Secretary of Security spokesperson \"for dialogue\" under Micheletti. Zelaya claimed that Joya had reactivated the death squad, with dozens of government opponents having been murdered since the ascent of the Michiletti and Lobo governments.\n\nThroughout the Guatemalan Civil War, both military and \"civilian\" governments utilized death squads as a counterinsurgency strategy. The use of \"death squads\" as a government tactic became particularly widespread after 1966. Throughout 1966 and the first three months of 1967, within the framework of what military commentators referred to as \"el-contra terror\", government forces killed an estimated 8,000 civilians accused of \"subversive\" activity. This marked a turning point in the history of the Guatemalan security apparatus, and brought about a new era in which mass murder of both real and suspected subversives by government \"death squads\" became a common occurrence in the country. A noted Guatemalan sociologist estimated the number of government killings between 1966 and 1974 at approximately 5,250 a year (for a total death toll of approximately 42,000 during the presidencies of Julio César Méndez Montenegro and Carlos Arana Osorio). Killings by both official and unofficial security forces would climax in the late 1970s and early 1980s under the presidencies of Fernando Romeo Lucas García and Efraín Ríos Montt, with over 18,000 documented killings in 1982 alone.\n\nGreg Grandin claims that \"Washington, of course, publicly denied its support for paramilitarism, but the practice of political disappearances took a great leap forward in Guatemala in 1966 with the birth of a death squad created, and directly supervised, by U.S. security advisors.\" An upsurge in rebel activity in Guatemala convinced the US to provide increased counterinsurgency assistance to Guatemala's security apparatus in the mid to late 1960s. Documents released in 1999 details how United States military and police advisers had encouraged and assisted Guatemalan military officials in the use of repressive techniques, including helping establish a \"safe house\" from within the presidential palace as a location to coordinate counter insugency activities. In 1981, it was reported by Amnesty International that this same \"safe house\" was in use by Guatemalan security officials to coordinate counterinsurgency activities involving the use of the \"death squads.\"\n\nAccording to a victim's brother, Mirtala Linares \"He wouldn't tell us anything; he claimed they hadn't captured [Sergio], that he knew nothing of his whereabouts – and that maybe my brother had gone as an illegal alien to the United States! That was how he answered us.\"\n\nThroughout the Ortega regime, starting in 2006, but escalating with the 2018 Nicaraguan protests, the dictatorship has employed death squads also known as \"Turbas\" or para military groups armed and aided by the National Police to kill over 300 unarmed protesters including infants, and people burned alive, as well as \"disappear\" hundreds more to unknown locations and fate. These actions have been roundly condemned by the international community, the Organization of American States, Human Rights Watch, and the local and international Catholic Church.\n\nAmnesty International reports that \"the security forces in Argentina first started using \"death squads\" in late 1973. One example was Alianza Anticomunista Argentina, a far-right death squad mainly active during the \"Dirty War\". By the time military rule ended in 1983 some 1,500 people had been killed directly by \"death squads\", and over 9,000 named people and many more undocumented victims had been \"disappeared\"—kidnapped and murdered secretly—according to the officially appointed National Commission on Disappeared People (CONADEP).\n\nThe \"Esquadrão da Morte\" (\"Death Squad\" in Portuguese) was a paramilitary organization that emerged in the late 1960s in the context of the Brazilian Military Dictatorship. It was the first group to have received the name \"Death Squad\" in Latin America, but its actions resembled traditional vigilantism as most executions were not exclusively political-related. The greater share of the political executions during the 21 years of Military Dictatorship (1964–1985) were done by the Brazilian Armed Forces itself. The purpose of the original \"Death Squad\" was, with the consent of the military government, to persecute, torture and kill suspected criminals (\"marginais\") regarded as dangerous to society. It began in the former State of Guanabara led by Detective Mariel Mariscot, one of the \"Twelve Golden Men of Rio de Janeiro's Police\", and from there it spread throughout Brazil in the 1970s. In general, its members were politicians, members of the judiciary, and police officials. As a rule, these groups were financed by members of the business community.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, several other organizations were modeled after the 1960s \"Esquadrão da Morte.\" The most famous such organization is \"Scuderie Detetive Le Cocq\" (English: \"Shield of Detective Le Cocq\"), named after deceased Detective Milton Le Cocq. The group was particularly active in the Brazilian Southeastern States of Guanabara and Rio de Janeiro, and remains active in the state of Espírito Santo. In the State of São Paulo, Death Squads and individual gunmen called \"justiceiros\" were pervasive and executions almost were exclusively the work of off-duty policemen. In 1983, a police officer nicknamed \"Cabo Bruno\" was convicted for murdering more than 50 victims.\n\nThe \"Death Squads\" active under the rule of the military dictatorship continue as a cultural legacy of the Brazilian police. In the 2000s, police officers remain linked with death-squad-type executions. In 2003, roughly 2,000 extrajudicial murders occurred in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, with Amnesty International claiming the numbers are likely far higher.\n\nOne of the most notorious murder gangs operated by the Chilean Army was the Caravan of Death, whose members travelled by helicopter throughout Chile between 30 September and 22 October 1973. During this foray, members of the squad ordered or personally carried out the execution of at least 75 individuals held in Army custody in these garrisons. According to the NGO \"Memoria y Justicia\", the squad killed 26 in the South and 71 in the North, making a total of 97 victims. Augusto Pinochet was indicted in December 2002 in this case, but he died four years later without having been convicted. The trial, however, is on-going , other militaries and a former military chaplain having been indicted in this case.\nOn 28 November 2006, Víctor Montiglio, charged of this case, ordered Pinochet's house arrest According to the Chilean Government's own Truth and Reconciliation (Rettig) report, 2,279 people were killed in the operations of Pinochet's regime. In June 1999, judge Juan Guzmán Tapia ordered the arrest of five retired generals.\n\nThe United States supported death squads in Colombia, El Salvador and Guatemala during the 1980s. In 1993, Amnesty International reported that clandestine military units began covertly operating as death squads in 1978. According to the report, throughout the 1980s political killings rose to a peak of 3,500 in 1988, averaging some 1,500 victims per year since then, and \"over 1,500 civilians are also believed to have \"disappeared\" since 1978.\" The AUC, formed in 1997, was the most prominent paramilitary group. \n\nAccording to a 2014 report published by Human Rights Watch (HRW) on Buenaventura, a port town in Colombia, \"entire neighborhoods were dominated by powerful paramilitary successor groups\" HRW reports that the groups \"restrict residents' movements, recruit their children, extort businesses, and routinely engage in horrific acts of violence against anyone who defies their will.\" It is reported that scores of people have been \"disappeared\" from the town over the years. Bodies are dismembered before they are disposed of and residents have reported the existence of \"casas de pique\", \"chop-up houses\" where people are slaughtered. Many residents have fled and are considered to have been \"forcibly displaced\": 22,028 residents fled in 2011, 15,191 in 2012, and 13,468 between January and October 2013.\n\nIn Colombia, the terms \"death squads\", \"paramilitaries\" or \"self-defense groups\" have been used interchangeably and otherwise, referring to either a single phenomenon, also known as paramilitarism, or to different but related aspects of the same. There are reports that Los Pepes, the death squad led by brothers Fidel and Carlos Castaño, had ties to some members of the Colombian National Police, especially the Search Bloc (Bloque de Búsqueda) unit.\n\nA report from the country's public prosecutors office at the end of 2009 reported the number of 28,000 disappeared by paramilitary and guerrilla groups. only 300 corpses were identified and 600 in 2009. According to the prosecutor's office, it will take many more years before all the bodies recovered can be identified. \n\nAt least 40% of the national legislature are said to have ties to paramilitary groups. In August 2018, prosecutors in Colombia charged 13 Chiquita brands with supporting the right wing death squad that killed hundreds in the Urabá Antioquia region between 1996 and 2004. Salvatore Mancuso, a jailed paramilitary leader, has accused Del Monte, Dole and Chiquita of funding right wing death squads. Chiquita was fined $25 million after admitting they had paid $1.7 million to paramilitaries over six years; the reason for the payments remains a matter of dispute, with Chiquita claiming the money was routine extortion money paid to paramilitary groups to protect workers. Activists, on the other hand, insist that a portion of the money paid by Chiquita was used to finance political assassinations.\n\nPeruvian government death squads carried out massacres against radicals and civilians in their fight against Shining Path and Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement.\n\nIn its 2003 and 2002 world reports, Human Rights Watch reported the existence of death squads in several Venezuelan states, involving members of the local police, the DISIP and the National Guard. These groups were responsible for the extrajudicial killings of civilians and wanted or alleged criminals, including street criminals, looters and drug users. By 2016 and 2017 the members of the OLP (Operación de Liberación del Pueblo) under Nicolas Maduro have been responsible for the disappearance and murder of dozens of civilians\n\nIn contemporary times, the Bangladeshi \"Rapid Action Battalion\" has been criticized by rights groups for its use of extrajudicial killings. In addition, there have been many reports of torture in connection with the battalion's activities. Several battalion members have been accused of murder and obstruction of justice during the Narayanganj Seven murder. They've been known to kill civilian suspects for the explicit purpose of avoiding trials. They have also been accused of carrying out a campaign of forced disappearances.\n\nThe Khmer Rouge began employing death squads to purge Cambodia of non-communists after taking over the country in 1975. They rounded up their victims, questioned them and then took them out to killing fields.\n\nPrior to the independence of Bangladesh from Pakistani occupation, the Pakistan Army carried out massive campaigns of mass murder and genocide on the native Bengali population in East Pakistan, especially against Hindu minorities. A significant part of the genocide carried out by Pakistan involved the murder of intellectuals in the country, which were carried out by an Islamist paramilitary death squad named Al-Badr.\n\nThe secret killings of Assam (1998–2001) was probably the darkest chapter in Assam's political history when relatives, friends, sympathisers of ULFA insurgents were systematically killed by unknown assailants.These extrajudicial murders happened in Assam between 1998 and 2001. This extrajudicial killings were conducted by the state government using SULFA members and the security forces in the name of counter-insurgency operations. The victims of these killings were relatives, friends and colleagues of ULFA militants. The most apparent justification for the whole exercise was that it was a tit-for-tat response to the ULFA-sponsored terrorism, specially the killings of their old comrades—the SULFAs.\n\nIn 1965–1966, hundreds of thousands of leftists and those believed tied to the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) were massacred by the Indonesian military and right-wing paramilitary death squads after a failed coup attempt which was blamed on the Communists. At least 400,000 to 500,000 people, perhaps as many as 3 million, were killed over a period of several months, with thousands more being interred in prisons and concentration camps under extremely inhumane conditions. The violence culminated in the fall of President Sukarno and the commencement of Suharto's thirty-year authoritarian reign.\n\nThere are certain vigilante death squads that are active in the Philippines, especially in Davao City where local death squads roam around the city to hunt criminals.\n\nAfter winning the Presidency in June 2016, Rodrigo Duterte had urged, \"If you know of any addicts, go ahead and kill them yourself as getting their parents to do it would be too painful.\" By March 2017, the death toll for the Philippine Drug War passed 8,000 people.\n\nNews reports on the use of death squads in Korea originated around the middle of the 20th century such as the Jeju Massacre and Daejeon. There were also the multiple deaths that made the news in 1980 in Gwangju.\n\nDuring the cold war, in the short period of democracy in Thailand (1973 - 1976), three right-wing paramilitary groups, Nawaphon, Red Gaurs, and Village Scouts were founded and supported by Internal Security Operations Command and Border Patrol Police to promote national unity, loyalty to Thai royal family, and anti-communism. They were also heavily funded and backed by the United States government, and were under the patronage of the royal family themselves. Among their ranks were former soldiers, veterans of the Vietnam War, former mercenaries in Laos, and violent vocational students.\n\nThese groups were first employed to counter protests of the pro-democracy and left-wing students movement, attacking them with firearms and grenades. When the ideological conflict escalated, they started assassinating labor and peasants union officials and progressive politicians, the most famous was Dr. Boonsanong Punyodyana, the general secretary of the Socialist Party of Thailand. The conflict reached its peak with the Thammasat University massacre in 1976, which the Royal Thai Armed Forces and Royal Thai Police, supported by the three aforementioned paramilitary groups, stormed the university and shot mostly unarmed student protesters indiscriminately, resulting in at least 46 deaths. A military coup was staged later in the same day. During the military rule, the paramilitary groups' popularity dimished.\n\nIn contemporary Thailand, many extrajudicial killings occurred during the 2003 anti-drug effort of Thailand's prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra were attributed to government-sponsored death squads. Rumors still persist that there is collusion between the government, rogue military officers and radical right wing/anti-drugs death squads,\n\nwith both Muslim and Buddhist sectarian death squads still operating in the South of the country.\n\nThe French military used death squads during the Algerian War (1954–1962).\n\nDeath squads first appeared in Germany following the end of the First World War and the overthrow of the House of Hohenzollern. In order to prevent a coup d'etat by Soviet-backed German Communists, the SPD-dominated government of the Weimar Republic declared a state of emergency and ordered the recruitment of war veterans into militias called the Freikorps. Although officially answering to Defense Minister Gustav Noske, the Freikorps tended to be drunken, trigger happy, and loyal only to their own commanders. However, they were instrumental in the defeat of the 1919 Spartacist Uprising and the annexation of the short-lived Bavarian Soviet Republic. The most famous victims of the Freikorps were the Communist leaders Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, who were captured after the suppression of the Spartacist Uprising and shot without trial. After the Freikorps units turned against the Republic in the monarchist Kapp Putsch, many of the leaders were forced to flee abroad and the units were largely disbanded.\n\nSome Freikorps veterans drifted into the ultra-nationalist Organisation Consul, which regarded the 1918 Armistice and the Versailles Treaty as treasonous and assassinated politicians who were associated with them. Among their victims were Matthias Erzberger and Walter Rathenau, both of whom were cabinet ministers in the Weimar regime.\n\nIn addition, the city of Munich remained a headquarters of Russian White émigré hit teams, which targeted those who were believed to have betrayed the Tsar. Their most infamous operation remains the 1922 attempt on the life of Russian Provisional Government statesman Pavel Miliukov in Berlin. When newspaper publisher Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov attempted to shield the intended victim, he was fatally shot by assassin Piotr Shabelsky-Bork.\n\nDuring the same era, the Communist Party of Germany also operated its own assassination squads. Titled, the Rotfrontkämpferbund they carried out assassinations of carefully selected individuals from the Weimar regime as well as assassinations of members of rival political parties. The most infamous operations of Weimar-era Communist death squads remain the 1931 slayings of Berlin police Captains Paul Anlauf and Franz Lenck. Those involved in the ambush either fled to the Soviet Union or were arrested and prosecuted. Among those to receive the death penalty was Max Matern, who was later glorified as a martyr by the East German State. The last surviving conspirator, former East German secret police head Erich Mielke, was belatedly tried and convicted for the murders in 1993. The evidence needed to successfully prosecute him had been found in his personal safe after German reunification.\n\nBetween 1933 and 1945, Germany was a one-party state ruled by the fascist Nazi Party and its leader, Adolf Hitler. During this period, the Nazis made extensive use of death squads and targeted killings.\n\nIn 1934, Hitler ordered the extrajudicial killings of Ernst Röhm and all members of the Sturmabteilung who remained loyal to him. Simultaneously, Hitler also ordered a mass purge of the German armed forces, targeting officers who, like General Kurt von Schleicher, had opposed his drive for absolute power. These massacres have gone down in history as, \"The Night of the Long Knives.\"\n\nFollowing the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, the German military was followed by four travelling death squads called \"Einsatzgruppen\" to hunt down and kill Jews, Communists and other so-called undesirables in the occupied areas. This was the first of the massacres which comprised the Holocaust. Typically, the victims, who included women and children, were forcibly marched from their homes to open graves or ravines before being shot. Many others suffocated in specially designed poison trucks called gas vans. Between 1941 and 1944, the \"Einsatzgruppen\" killed some two million people, including about 1.3 million Jews, as well as tens of thousands of suspected political dissidents, most of the Polish upper class and intelligentsia, POWs, and uncounted numbers of Romany.\n\nAnother use of death squad tactics in Nazi Germany took place after the failure of the July 20th Plot, which had aimed to assassinate Hitler and dismantle the Nazi Party. More than 4,000 members and sympathizers of the German Resistance and their families were either killed out right or subjected to judicial murder by Judge Roland Freisler of the People's Court. Those whom Freisler sentenced to death were routinely hanged from piano wire nooses within hours of their trials.\n\nThese tactics ended only with the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945.\n\nBetween the end of World War II and 1989, Germany was divided into the capitalist Federal Republic of Germany and the Communist German Democratic Republic, a one-party state under the Socialist Unity Party and its secret police, the Stasi. During these years, kangaroo courts and cavalier use of the death penalty were routinely used against suspected enemies of the State. In order to prevent East German citizens from defecting to the West, orders were issued to border guards to shoot suspected defectors on sight. During the 1980s, the Stasi carried out a mission to hunt down and assassinate West Germans who were suspected of smuggling East Germans.\n\nOn the orders of the Party leadership and Stasi chief Erich Mielke, the East German Government financed, armed, and trained, \"urban guerrillas,\" from numerous countries. According to ex-Stasi Colonel Rainer Wiegand, ties to terrorist organizations were overseen by Markus Wolf and Department Three of the Stasi's foreign intelligence wing. Members of the West German \"Rote Armee Fraktion\", the Chilean \"Manuel Rodríguez Patriotic Front\", and the South African \"Umkhonto we Sizwe\" were brought to East Germany for training in the use of military hardware and, \"the leadership role of the Party.\" Similar treatment was meted out to Palestinian terrorists from the \"Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine\", \"Abu Nidal\", and \"Black September\".\n\nOther Stasi agents worked as military advisers to African Marxist guerrillas and the governments they later formed. They included the Namibian \"SWAPO\" and the Angolan \"MPLA\" during the South African Border War, the \"FRELIMO\" during the Mozambican War of Independence and civil war, and Robert Mugabe's \"ZANLA\" during the Rhodesian Bush War.\n\nColonel Wiegand revealed that Mielke and Wolf provided bodyguards from the Stasi's counter-terrorism division for Senior PLO terrorist Carlos the Jackal and \"Black September\" leader Abu Daoud during their visits to the GDR. Col. Wiegand had been sickened by the 1972 Munich massacre and was horrified that the GDR would treat the man who ordered it as an honored guest. When he protested, Wiegand was told that Abu Daoud was, \"a friend of our country, a high-ranking political functionary,\" and that there was no proof that he was a terrorist.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Wiegand secretly recruited a Libyan diplomat into spying on his colleagues. Wiegand's informant told him that the La Belle bombing and other terrorist attacks against western citizens were being planned at the Libyan Embassy in East Berlin. When Wiegand showed him a detailed report, Mielke informed the SED's Politburo, which ordered the Colonel to continue surveillance but not interfere with the plans of the Libyans.\n\nShortly before German Reunification, West Germany's Federal Constitutional Court indicted former Stasi chief Erich Mielke for collusion with two Red Army Faction terrorist attacks against U.S. military personnel. The first was the car bomb attack at Ramstein Air Base on 31 August 1981. The second was the attempted murder of United States Army General Frederick Kroesen at Heidelberg on 15 September 1981. The latter attack, which was carried out by RAF members Brigitte Mohnhaupt and Christian Klar, involved firing an RPG-7 anti-tank rocket into the General's armored Mercedes. Due to reasons of senile dementia, Mielke was never placed on trial for either attack.\n\nFollowing German reunification, death squads linked to foreign intelligence services have continued to operate in Germany. The most infamous example of this remains the 1992 Mykonos restaurant assassinations, in which a group of anti-Islamist Iranians were fatally machine-gunned in a Greek restaurant in Berlin. A German court ultimately convicted the assassins and exposed the involvement of intelligence services of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The murder and subsequent trial has been publicized in the nonfiction bestseller \"The Assassins of the Turquois Palace\" by Roya Hakakian.\n\nFor most of World War II, Hungary was an ally of Nazi Germany. However, the Regency Council of Admiral Miklos Horthy refused to permit the deportation of Hungarian Jews to Nazi death camps.\n\nThen, in October 1944, Horthy announced a cease-fire with the Allies and ordered the Hungarian Army to lay down their arms. In response, Nazi Germany launched Operation Panzerfaust, a covert operation which forced Horthy to abdicate in favour of the Fascist and militantly racist Arrow Cross Party, which was led by Ferenc Szálasi. This was followed by an Arrow Cross coup in Budapest on the same day. Szálasi was declared \"Leader of the Nation\" and prime minister of a \"Government of National Unity\".\n\nArrow Cross rule, despite lasting only three months, was brutal. Death squads killed as many as 38,000 Hungarians. Arrow Cross officers helped Adolf Eichmann re-activate the deportation proceedings from which the Jews of Budapest had previously been spared, sending some 80,000 Jews out of the city on slave labor details and many more straight to death camps. Many Jewish males of conscription age were already serving as slave labor for the Hungarian Army's Forced Labor Battalions. Most of them died, including many who were murdered outright after the end of the fighting as they were returning home. Quickly formed battalions raided the Yellow Star Houses and combed the streets, hunting down Jews claimed to be partisans and saboteurs since Jews attacked Arrow Cross squads at least six to eight times with gunfire. These approximately 200 Jews were taken to the bridges crossing the Danube, where they were shot and their bodies borne away by the waters of the river because many were attached to weights while they were handcuffed to each other in pairs.\n\nRed Army troops reached the outskirts of the city in December 1944, and the Battle of Budapest began, although it has often been claimed that there is no proof that the Arrow Cross members and the Germans conspired to destroy the Budapest ghetto. Days before he fled the city, Arrow Cross Interior Minister Gabor Vájna commanded that streets and squares named after Jews be renamed.\n\nAs control of the city's institutions began to decay, the Arrow Cross trained their guns on the most helpless possible targets: patients in the beds of the city's two Jewish hospitals on Maros Street and Bethlen Square, and residents in the Jewish poorhouse on Alma Road. Arrow Cross members continually sought to raid the ghettos and Jewish concentration buildings; the majority of Budapest's Jews were saved only by a handful of Jewish leaders and foreign diplomats, most famously the Swedish Raoul Wallenberg, the Papal Nuncio Monsignor Angelo Rotta, Swiss Consul Carl Lutz and Francoist Spain's consul general, Giorgio Perlasca. Szálasi knew that the documents used by these diplomats to save Jews were invalid according to international law, but ordered that they be respected.\n\nThe Arrow Cross government effectively fell at the end of January 1945, when the Soviet Army took Pest and their enemies forces retreated across the Danube to Buda. Szálasi had escaped from Budapest on December 11, 1944, taking with him the Hungarian royal crown, while Arrow Cross members and German forces continued to fight a rear-guard action in the far west of Hungary until the end of the war in April 1945.\n\nAfter the war, many of the Arrow Cross leaders were captured and tried for war crimes. Many were executed, including Ferenc Szálasi. Fr. András Kun, a Roman Catholic priest who commanded an Arrow Cross death squad while dressed in his cassock, was also convicted and hanged after the war. Fr. Kun's cassock remains on permanent display at the House of Terror in Budapest.\n\nDuring the Irish War of Independence, the Irish Republican Army under Michael Collins made use of death squads and targeted killings. At the beginning of the conflict, Collins recruited a group of men from the IRA's Dublin Brigade, who were dubbed \"The Twelve Apostles\". At Collins' orders, the Twelve Apostles strategically assassinated members of Crown security forces, British Intelligence spymasters, and moles within IRA ranks. Collins was assisted in this by IRA moles within Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) and the Dublin Metropolitan Police. Furthermore, several secretaries working for the British Army High Command in Dublin were also working as spies for Collins.\n\nAs British authority in Ireland began to disintegrate, Prime Minister David Lloyd George declared a state of emergency. In order to break the IRA, Winston Churchill, the Secretary of State for War, suggested the recruitment of World War I veterans into paramilitary death squads. Lloyd George agreed to the proposal, and advertisements were filed in British newspapers. Former enlisted men were formed into the Black and Tans, so called because of their mixture of British Army and police uniforms. Veterans who had held officers rank were formed into the Auxiliary Division, the members of which were higher paid and received better supplies. Members of both units, however, were despised by Irish civilians, against whom the \"Tans\" and \"Auxies\" routinely retaliated for IRA raids and assassinations.\n\nTo make matters worse, it was also far from unheard of for the regular British Army, the Royal Irish Constabulary, or the Dublin Metropolitan Police to use the same tactics. In many cases, mixed forces of Army, policemen, and paramilitaries would abduct, torture, and summarily execute Irish civilians who were unconnected with the IRA. This further eroded support for the British rule among the Irish people.\nOn 20 March 1920, Tomás Mac Curtain, the nationalist Lord Mayor of Cork, was shot dead in front of his wife and son by a group of RIC officers with blackened faces.\n\nEnraged, Collins ordered the Twelve Apostles to hunt down and assassinate every one of the RIC officers involved in Mac Curtain's murder. On 22 August 1920, RIC District Inspector Oswald Swanzy, who had ordered the assassination, was shot dead with Mac Curtain's revolver while leaving a Protestant church service in Lisburn, County Antrim. This sparked a \"pogrom\" against the Catholic residents of the town.\n\nOn Bloody Sunday, Collins' men killed fourteen MI5 agents who comprised the Cairo Gang. In one incident, the IRA group was heard to scream, \"May the Lord have mercy on your souls\", before opening fire.\n\nCollins later said of the incident,\n\nMy one intention was the destruction of the undesirables who continued to make miserable the lives of ordinary decent citizens. I have proof enough to assure myself of the atrocities which this gang of spies and informers have committed. If I had a second motive it was no more than a feeling such as I would have for a dangerous reptile. By their destruction the very air is made sweeter. For myself, my conscience is clear. There is no crime in detecting in wartime the spy and the informer. They have destroyed without trial. I have paid them back in their own coin.\n\nThat afternoon, British security forces opened fire into the crowd during a Gaelic football match at Croke Park, killing 14 and wounding 68 players and spectators.\n\nThe hostilities ended in 1921 with the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which guaranteed the independence of the Irish Free State.\n\n\nAfter independence, Irish nationalist movement divided over the terms of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which granted a partitioned Ireland Dominion status within the British Empire. Furthermore, all officials of the new Irish State were required to take an oath of allegiance to King George V of the United Kingdom.\n\nAs a result, the Irish Civil War was fought between those Irish nationalists who accepted the Treaty and those who considered it treasonous. Although fought between men who had recently served together against the British, the fighting was often without quarter and brutal atrocities were committed by both sides.\n\nIn IRA communications, the Irish State was referred to as, \"The Imperial Gang,\" the \"Murder Government,\" and as, \"a British-imposed Dáil.\" Therefore, Irish men and women who supported the Free State were regarded as traitors. At the orders of IRA Chief of Staff Liam Lynch, Anti-Treaty IRA began raising money for their cause via armed robbery of banks and post offices. On 30 November 1922, Liam Lynch issues what were dubbed the \"orders of frightfulness\", in which he ordered IRA members to assassinate members of the Irish Parliament, or Dáil Éireann, and Senators whenever possible. This General Order sanctioned the assassination of certain judges and newspaper editors. The IRA also launched a concerted arson campaign against the homes of members of the Dáil, or TDs. Among these attacks were the burning of the house of TD James McGarry, resulting in the death of his seven-year-old son and the murder of Free state minister Kevin O'Higgins elderly father and burning of his family home at Stradbally in early 1923.\n\nAfter TD Sean Hales was assassinated, the Dáil began to treat the civil war as a state of emergency. They voted to retaliate by summarily executing four captured members of IRA Executive -- Rory O'Connor, Liam Mellows, Richard Barrett and Joe McKelvey. After the motion passed, all four men were executed by firing squad on December 8, 1922. During the conflict, at least 73 other captured IRA men were treated in the same fashion—some following court martial, others without trial. There are no conclusive figures for the number of unofficial executions of captured IRA insurgents, but Republican officer Todd Andrews estimated 153. (see Executions during the Irish Civil War).\n\nAt the beginning of the Civil War, the Irish State formed a special counter-terrorism police, which was called the Criminal Investigation Department. Based in Dublin's Oriel House, the CID were despised by the Anti-Treaty IRA, which referred to them as, \"The Murder Gang.\" During the Battle of Dublin, the CID is known to have shot 25 Anti-Treaty militants, officially while, \"resisting arrest.\" Ultimately, the Irish State disbanded CID upon the cessation of hostilities in 1923.\n\nDespite the best efforts of the Anti-Treaty forces, both the Irish Army and the CID proved highly effective in both combat and intelligence work. One tactic involved placing IRA message couriers under surveillance, which routinely led the Irish security forces to senior members of the insurgency.\n\nAccording to historian Tom Mahon, the Irish Civil War, \"effectively ended,\" on 10 April 1923, when the Irish Army tracked down and mortally wounded Liam Lynch during a skirmish in the Knockmealdown Mountains of County Tipperary. Twenty days later, Lynch's successor, Frank Aiken, gave the order to, \"Surrender and dump arms.\"\n\nDuring the troubles in Northern Ireland accusations of collusion between the British state and Loyalist terror groups have been longstanding, with several army units implicated in accusations of collusion. The Military Reaction Force (MRF) was a covert intelligence-gathering unit of the British Army active in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, a former member described it as a \"legalised death squad\". In 1972, MRF teams carried out a number of drive-by shootings in Catholic and Irish nationalist areas of Belfast and have been linked with providing information to help loyalist paramilitaries to carry out attacks. Attacks on Catholic civilians attributed to the unit include the McGurk's Bar bombing, the Whiterock Road shooting, the Andersonstown shootings, the killing of Jean Smith, the Glen Road shooting, the St. James's Crescent shooting and the drive-by shooting of the New Lodge Six.\n\nThe Special Reconnaissance Unit, also known 14 Intelligence Company, was a part of the British Army Intelligence Corps. The unit was accused of acting in collusion with loyalist paramilitaries by former intelligence personnel Fred Holroyd and Colin Wallace in regards to the death of senior Provisional Irish Republican Army member John Francis Green, the Miami Showband killings and the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.\n\nThe Force Research Unit (FRU) is a covert military intelligence unit of the British Army part of the Intelligence Corps. The unit was found to have colluded with loyalist terror groups in the murder of civilians. This has been confirmed by some former members of the unit. From 1987 to 1991, it was commanded by Gordon Kerr. Another example is the loyalist Glenanne gang.\n\nDuring the 30 year of The Troubles in Northern Ireland, the Provisional IRA have also been accused of operating such squads. Their Internal Security Unit, commonly known as \"the nutting squad\", which carried out the killing of suspected informers and \"collaborators\" with the British security forces.\n\nPrior to World War II, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union fought a war by proxy during the Spanish Civil War. There were death squads used by both the Falangists and Republicans during this conflict. Prominent victims of the era's death squad violence include the poet Federico García Lorca, José Robles, and journalist Ramiro Ledesma Ramos. (see also Martyrs of the Spanish Civil War).\n\nThe Republican death squads were heavily staffed by members of Joseph Stalin's OGPU and targeted members of the Catholic clergy and the Spanish nobility for assassination (see Red Terror).\n\nAccording to author Donald Rayfield,\n\nStalin, Yezhov, and Beria distrusted Soviet participants in the Spanish war. Military advisors like Vladimir Antonov-Ovseenko, journalists like Koltsov were open to infection by the heresies, especially Trotsky's, prevalent among the Republic's supporters. NKVD agents sent to Spain were therefore keener on abducting and murdering anti-Stalinists among Republican leaders and International Brigade commanders than on fighting Franco. The defeat of the Republic, in Stalin's eyes, was caused not by the NKVD's diversionary efforts, but by the treachery of the heretics.\n\nJohn Dos Passos later wrote,\n\nI have come to think, especially since my trip to Spain, that civil liberties must be protected at every stage. In Spain I am sure that the introduction of GPU methods by the Communists did as much harm as their tank men, pilots and experienced military men did good. The trouble with an all powerful secret police in the hands of fanatics, or of anybody, is that once it gets started there's no stopping it until it has corrupted the whole body politic.\n\nThe ranks of the Republican assassination squads included Erich Mielke, the future head of the East German Ministry of State Security. Walter Janka, a veteran of the Republican forces who remembers him described Mielke's career as follows,\n\nWhile I was fighting at the front, shooting at the Fascists, Mielke served in the rear, shooting Trotskyites and Anarchists. \n\nIn the modern era, Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberación (GAL) terrorist group were death squads illegally set up by officials within the Spanish government to fight ETA. They were active from 1983 until 1987, under the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party's cabinets.\n\nGrey Wolves (organization) was established by Colonel Alparslan Türkeş in the 1960s, it was the main nationalist force during the political violence in 1976–80 in Turkey. During this period, the organization became a \"death squad\" engaged in \"street killings and gunbattles\". According to authorities, 220 of its members carried out 694 murders of left-wing and liberal activists and intellectuals. Attacks on university students were commonplace. They killed hundreds of Alevis in the Maraş massacre of 1978 and are alleged to have been behind the Taksim Square massacre of 1977. The masterminds behind the attempt on Pope John Paul II's life in 1981 by Grey Wolves member Mehmet Ali Ağca were not identified and the organization's role remains unclear.\n\nThe Srebrenica Massacre, also known as the Srebrenica Genocide, was the July 1995 killing of an estimated 8,000 Bosniak men and boys, as well as the ethnic cleansing of 1,000–2,000 refugees in the area of Srebrenica in Bosnia and Herzegovina, by units of the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) under the command of General Ratko Mladić during the Bosnian War. In addition to the VRS, a paramilitary unit from Serbia known as the Scorpions participated in the massacre.\n\nIn Potočari, some of the executions were carried out at night under arc lights, and industrial bulldozers then pushed the bodies into mass graves. According to evidence collected from Bosniaks by French policeman Jean-René Ruez, some were buried alive; he also heard testimony describing Serb forces killing and torturing refugees at will, streets littered with corpses, people committing suicide to avoid having their noses, lips and ears chopped off, and adults being forced to watch the soldiers kill their children.\n\nIn 2004, in a unanimous ruling on the \"Prosecutor v. Krstić\" case, the Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) located in The Hague ruled that the Srebrenica massacre was genocide.\n\nThe first organized use of death squad violence in Russia dates from the 16th century reign of Ivan the Terrible, the first Russian monarch to claim the title of Tsar. Named the Oprichniki, they wore quivers which contained brooms, symbolizing their mission to ferret the enemies of the Tsar. They dressed in black garb, which was similar to a Russian Orthodox monastic habit, and bore the insignia of a severed dog's head (to sniff out treason and the enemies of the Tsar) and a broom (to sweep them away). The dog's head was also symbolic of their \"nipping at the heels of the Tsar's enemies.\" They were sometimes called the \"Tsar's Dogs\" on account of their loyalty to him. They also rode black horses in order to inspire a greater level of terror.\n\nTheir oath of allegiance was:\n\"I swear to be true to the Lord, Grand Prince, and his realm, to the young Grand Princes, and to the Grand Princess, and not to maintain silence about any evil that I may know or have heard or may hear which is being contemplated against the Tsar, his realms, the young princes or the Tsaritsa. I swear also not to eat or drink with the zemshchina, and not to have anything in common with them. On this I kiss the cross.\"\n\nLed by Malyuta Skuratov, the Oprichniki routinely tortured and executed whomever the Tsar suspected of treason, including boyars, merchants, clergymen, commoners, and even entire cities. The memoirs of Heinrich von Staden, provide a detailed description of both the Tsar's motivations and the inner workings of the Oprichniki.\n\nThe most famous victims of the Oprichniki remains Kyr Philip Kolychev, the Metropolitan bishop of Moscow. The Metropolitan gave a sermon in the Tsar's presence in which he rebuked Ivan for terrorizing and murdering large numbers of innocent people and their families. Enraged, Tsar Ivan convened a Church council which declared Metropolitan Philip defrocked and imprisoned in a monastery for delinquent clergy. Years later, Tsar Ivan sent an emissary demanding Metropolitan Philip's blessing on his plans for the Novgorod massacre. Metropolitan Philip said, \"Only the good are blessed.\"\n\nEnraged, Tsar Ivan sent Skuratov to personally strangle the Metropolitan in his monastic cell. Metropolitan Philip was subsequently glorified as a Saint by the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nIn later centuries, Russian Tsars would declare a state of emergency and use death squad tactics in order to suppress domestic uprisings like Pugachev's Rebellion and the Russian Revolution of 1905. During the latter, Tsar Nicholas II of Russia ordered the Imperial Russian Army to ally itself with the Black Hundreds, an ultra-nationalist paramilitary group. Those captured in arms against the Tsar's forces were tried by military tribunals before being hanged or shot. According to Simon Sebag Montefiore, being caught wearing similar clothing to Anti-Tsarist militias was often enough for court martial followed by execution. These tactics were continued by the anti-communist White Movement during the Russian Civil War (1917-1920).\n\nOpponents of the House of Romanov also carried out targeted killings of those deemed as enemies of Socialism, which was referred to as individual terror. Among them were the People's Will, the Bolshevik Battle Squad, and the Combat Brigade of the Socialist Revolutionary Party. Among the victims of Marxist death squads were Tsar Alexander II of Russia, the Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia, and the Georgian language poet and publisher Ilia Chavchavadze. These tactics were drastically accelerated following the October Revolution.\n\nFollowing the Bolshevik Revolution, the former Russian Empire spent 73 years as a one party state ruled by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Especially between 1917 and 1953, the CPSU routinely ordered the abduction, torture, and execution of massive numbers of real and suspected anti-communists. Those with upper class origins were routinely targeted in this way during the early years of the Soviet Union.\n\nMost of the repression was committed by the regular forces of the state, like the army and the police, but there were also many cases of clandestine and covert operations.\n\nDuring the interwar period, the NKVD routinely targeted anti-Stalinists in the West for abduction or murder. Among them were the CPSU's former Commissar of War, Leon Trotsky, who was assassinated in Mexico City on 21 August 1940 by NKVD officer Ramon Mercador. Furthermore, former White Army Generals Alexander Kutepov and Evgeny Miller were abducted in Paris by the NKVD. Kutepov is alleged to have had a heart attack before he could be smuggled back to Moscow, and shot. General Miller was not so fortunate and died in Moscow's Lubianka Prison. Yevhen Konovalets, the founder of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, was blown to bits by NKVD officer Pavel Sudoplatov in Rotterdam on 23 May 1938.\n\nIn the post-war period, the Russian Orthodox Church collaborated with the Soviet State in a campaign to eliminate Eastern Rite Catholicism in the newly annexed regions of Soviet-ruled Ukraine. Priests and laity who refused to convert to Orthodoxy were either assassinated or deported to the GULAGs in Karaganda. On 27 October 1947, the NKVD staged a car accident in order to assassinate the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Bishop Theodore Romzha of Mukachevo. When the \"accident\" failed to kill the Bishop, the NKVD poisoned him in his hospital bed on 1 November 1947.\n\nEven in the post-Stalin era, the Soviet secret police continued to assassinate anti-communists in the West. Two of the most notable victims were Lev Rebet and Stepan Bandera, Ukrainian nationalists who were assassinated by the KGB in Munich, West Germany. Both deaths were believed to be accidental until 1961, when their murderer, Bohdan Stashynsky, defected to the West with his wife and voluntarily surrendered to West German authorities.\n\nThe Russian military has been accused of using death squads against Chechen insurgents. After defecting to the United States in October, 2000, Sergei Tretyakov, an SVR agent, accused the Government of the Russian Federation of following Soviet-era practices by routinely assassinating its critics abroad.\n\nThe Iron Guard of Egypt was a pro-palace political movement or a secret palace organization which assassinated Farouk of Egypt's enemies or a secret unit with a licence to kill, which was believed to personally take orders from Farouk. It was involved in several deadly incidents.\n\nUnder the reign of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (1941–1979) the SAVAK (Security and Intelligence Service) was founded. During the 1960s and 70s, it was accused of using death squads. After the Islamic Revolution overthrew the Shah, Amnesty International continued to complain of human rights abuses in Iran. Suspected foes of the Ayatollah Khomeini, were imprisoned, tortured, tried by kangaroo courts, and executed. The most famous victim of the era's death squad violence remains Amir-Abbas Hoveida, a Prime Minister of Iran under the Shah. However, the same treatment was also meted out to senior officers in the Iranian military. Other cases exist of Iranians opposed to the Islamic Republic who have been tracked down and murdered abroad. One of the most notorious examples of this remains the 1992 Mykonos restaurant assassinations in Berlin, Germany.\n\nThe Iranian government's victims include civilians who have been killed by \"death squads\" that operate under the control of government agents but these killing operations have been denied by the Iranian government. This was particularly the case during the 1990s when more than 80 writers, translators, poets, political activists, and ordinary citizens who had been critical of the government in some way, disappeared or were found murdered. In 1983 the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) gave one of the leaders of Iran Khomeini information on Communist KGB agents in Iran. This information was almost certainly used. Later, The Iranian regime occasionally used death squads throughout the 1970s, 80s, and 90s. However, by the 2000s, it seems to have almost if not entirely ceased its operations. This partial Westernization of the country can be seen as paralleling similar events in Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates, and Northern Iraq beginning in the late 1990s.\n\nIraq was formed by the British from three provinces of the Ottoman Empire following the empire's breakup after World War I. Its population is overwhelmingly Muslim but is divided into Shiites and Sunnis, with a Kurdish minority in the north. The new state leadership in the capital of Baghdad was formerly composed of, for the most part, the old Sunni Arab elite.\n\nAfter Saddam Hussein was overthrown by the UK–US invasion in 2003 the secular socialist Baathist leadership were replaced with a provisional and later constitutional government that included leadership roles for the Shia and Kurds. This paralleled the development of ethnic militias by the Shia, Sunni, and the Kurdish Peshmerga.\n\nDuring the course of the Iraq War the country has increasingly become divided into three zones: a Kurdish ethnic zone to the north, a Sunni center and the Shia ethnic zone to the south.\n\nWhile all three groups have operated death squads,\nin the national capital of Baghdad some members of the now Shia police department and army formed unofficial, unsanctioned, but long tolerated death squads. They possibly have links to the Interior Ministry and are popularly known as the 'black crows'. These groups operated either by night or by day. They usually arrested people, then either tortured or killed them.\n\nThe victims of these attacks were predominantly young males who had probably been suspected of being members of the Sunni insurgency. Agitators such as Abdul Razaq al-Na'as, Dr. Abdullateef al-Mayah, and Dr. Wissam Al-Hashimi have also been killed. Women and children have also been arrested or killed. Some of these killings have also been simple robberies or other criminal activities.\n\nA feature in a May 2005 issue of the magazine of \"The New York Times\" accused the U.S. military of modelling the \"Wolf Brigade\", the Iraqi interior ministry police commandos, on the death squads that were used in the 1980s to crush the Marxist insurgency in El Salvador.\n\nIn 2004, the US dispatched James Steele as an envoy and special training adviser to the Iraqi Special Police Commandos who were later accused of torture and death squad activities. Steele had served in El Salvador in the 1980s, where he helped train government units involved in human rights violations death squads in their war against the FMLNF.\n\nDeath squads were active during the civil war from 1975 to 1990. The number of people who disappeared during the conflict is put around 17,000.\n\nMany human rights organisations like Amnesty International are campaigning against extrajudicial punishment along with the UN.\n\n\nAgencies:\n\n\n"}

It was signed into law on June 10, 1963, by John F. Kennedy as part of his New Frontier Program. In passing the bill, Congress stated that sex discrimination:\n\n\nThe law provides (in part) that:\n\nIn 1942, Republican congresswoman Winifred C. Stanley from Buffalo, N.Y. introduced H.R. 5056, Prohibiting Discrimination in Pay on Account of Sex, which did not pass at the time. The issue languished until 10 June 1963, when Congress passed the Equal Pay Act (\"EPA\" or the \"Act\") as an amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act, to \"prohibit discrimination on account of sex in the payment of wages by employers.\"\n\nCongress included within the text of the EPA a clear and concise policy statement and briefly described the problems it was intended to remedy. The clear statement of Congressional intent and policy guiding the EPA’s enactment indicate the Congressional desire to fashion a broad remedial framework to protect employees from wage discrimination on the basis of sex. The Supreme Court has expressly recognized the view that the EPA must be broadly construed to achieve Congress’ goal of remedying sexual discrimination. Congress passed the EPA out of \"concern for the weaker bargaining position of women\" to provide a remedy to discriminatory wage structures that reflect \"an ancient but outmoded belief that a man, because of his role in society, should be paid more than a woman.\" The EPA protects both men and women. It also protects administrative, professional and executive employees who are exempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n\nThe EPA, Section 206(d)(1), prohibits \"employer[s] ... [from] discriminat[ing] … on the basis of sex by paying wages to employees [...] at a rate less than the rate [paid] to employees of the opposite sex [...] for equal work on jobs [requiring] equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions[.]\" To establish a prima facie case under the EPA, an employee must show that:\n\nThe EPA provides that the employer may not pay lower wages to employees of one gender than it pays to employees of the other gender, employees within the same establishment for equal work at jobs that require equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and that are performed under similar working conditions.\n\nIt is important to note that the EPA does not contain any intent requirement within the statutory language. Liability under the EPA is established by meeting the three elements of the prima facie case, regardless of the intention of the employer. As such, the EPA imposes strict liability on employers who engage in wage discrimination on the basis of gender.\n\nOnce a plaintiff meets her or his heavy burden and establishes a prima facie case of gender discrimination under the EPA, then the defendant may avoid liability only by proving the existence of one of four statutory affirmative defenses. The EPA’s four affirmative defenses allow unequal pay for equal work when the wages are set \"pursuant to (i) a seniority system; (ii) a merit system; (iii) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (iv) ... any other factor other than sex[.]\"\n\nUpon its initial enactment, the EPA was \"the first step towards an adjustment of balance in pay for women.” As a part of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, the EPA was subject to the scope and exceptions of covered employees and employers contained within that act. On the floor of the House of Representatives, many Representatives voiced their concern that the EPA should act as the starting point for establishing pay parity for women. Subsequent to the enactment of the EPA, Congress undertook two actions which broadened the scope of federal protection against wage discrimination on the basis of sex.\n\nFirst, the same 88th Congress enacted Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. By including sex as an element protected from discrimination, Title VII expanded the protection of women from employment discrimination, to include almost all employees working for employers with fifteen or more employees. Foreseeing the potential conflict between the administration of two statutes with overlapping restrictions, Congress included the Bennett Amendment in Title VII, which incorporates the EPA’s four affirmative defenses into Title VII.\n\nSecond, Congress expanded the EPA’s coverage to professionals and other white-collar employees. For the first nine years of the EPA, the requirement of equal pay for equal work did not extend to persons employed in an executive, administrative or professional capacity, or as an outside salesperson. Therefore, the EPA exempted white-collar women from the protection of equal pay for equal work. In 1972, Congress enacted the Education Amendments of 1972, which amended the FLSA to expand the coverage of the EPA to these employees, by excluding the EPA from the professional workers exemption of the FLSA.\n\nThe Congress did not ignore the EPA’s economic consequences on the salaries and employment opportunities for both men and women. First, as an amendment of the FLSA, the EPA is part of the same legislative structure that houses the federal minimum wage laws. The EPA acts as a wage equalizer between men and women for equal jobs, and has the potential of acting as a price floor on the salaries of men or women for particular jobs. Economists, such as Thomas Sowell have asserted the EPA causes unemployment, and additional discrimination against women by excluding them from the labor market. Second, several Representatives voiced their concerns that the negative impact of setting price floors on the wages paid to women would reduce the availability of jobs for women. With the possible side effects of the Act noted on the Congressional record, the Act passed with little opposition, and no indication that any of the four affirmative defenses were intended to remedy or limit its negative consequences.\n\nAmerican women’s salaries have risen relative to men's since the EPA’s enactment, from 62.3% of men’s earnings in 1979 to 80.4% in 2004. The EPA’s equal pay for equal work goals have not been completely achieved, as demonstrated by the BLS data and Congressional findings within the text of the proposed Paycheck Fairness Act.\n\nThe EPA did not originally cover executives, administrators, outside salespeople, and professionals, but the Education Amendments of 1972 amended the EPA so that it does.\n\nAs a senator, Hillary Clinton first introduced the \"Paycheck Fairness Act\" on April 20, 2005, which, among other provisions, proposes to amend the EPA’s fourth affirmative defense to permit only bona fide factors other than sex that are job-related or serve a legitimate business interest. Representative Rosa DeLauro first introduced an identical bill in the House of Representatives on the same day. On January 29, 2009, President Barack Obama signed into law the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which overturned the holding of a Supreme Court case, \"Ledbetter v. Goodyear\", regarding the applicable statute of limitations. This bill, providing that each gender-unequal paycheck is a new violation of the law, was the first signing of the Obama Presidency and came almost forty-five years after the Equal Pay Act.\n\nHowever, a 2007 study commissioned by the Department of Labor cautioned against overzealous application of the EPA without closer examination of possible reasons for pay discrepancies. This study notes, for example, that men as a group earn higher wages in part because men dominate blue collar jobs, which are more likely to require cash payments for overtime work; in contrast, women comprise over half of the salaried white collar management workforce that is often exempted from overtime laws. In summary, the study stated:\n\"Although additional research in this area is clearly needed, this study leads to the unambiguous conclusion that the differences in the compensation of men and women are the result of a multitude of factors and that the raw wage gap should not be used as the basis to justify corrective action. Indeed, there may be nothing to correct. The differences in raw wages may be almost entirely the result of the individual choices being made by both male and female workers.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "213047", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=213047", "title": "Heir apparent", "text": "Heir apparent\n\nAn heir apparent or heiress apparent is a person who is first in a line of succession and cannot be displaced from inheriting by the birth of another person. An heir presumptive, by contrast, is someone who is first in line to inherit a title but who can be displaced by the birth of a more eligible heir.\n\nToday these terms most commonly describe heirs to hereditary titles (e.g. titles of nobility) or offices, especially when only inheritable by a single person. Most monarchies refer to the heir apparent of their thrones with the descriptive term of \"crown prince\" but these heirs may also be accorded with a more specific substantive title, such as Prince of Orange in the Netherlands, Duke of Brabant in Belgium, Prince of Asturias in Spain, or Prince of Wales in the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms. In France the title was \"le Dauphin\", in Imperial Russia it was Tsesarevich.\n\nThe term is also used metaphorically to indicate an \"anointed\" successor to any position of power, e.g. a political or corporate leader.\n\nThis article primarily describes the term \"heir apparent\" in a hereditary system regulated by laws of primogeniture—as opposed to cases where a monarch has a say in naming the heir.\n\nIn a hereditary system governed by some form of primogeniture, an heir apparent is easily identifiable as the person whose position as first in the line of succession to a title or office is secure, regardless of future births. An heir presumptive, by contrast, can always be \"bumped down\" in the succession by the birth of somebody more closely related in a legal sense (according to that form of primogeniture) to the current title-holder.\n\nThe clearest example occurs in the case of a holder of a hereditary title, one that can only be inherited by a single person, with no children. If at any time he were to produce children, they (the offspring of the title-holder) rank ahead of whatever more \"distant\" relative (the title-holder's sibling, perhaps, or a nephew or cousin) had been heir presumptive.\n\nMany legal systems assume childbirth is always possible regardless of age or health. In such circumstances a person may be, in a practical sense, the heir apparent but still, legally speaking, heir presumptive. Indeed, when Queen Victoria succeeded her uncle King William IV, the wording of the proclamation even gave as a caveat:\n\nThis provided for the possibility that William's wife, Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen, was pregnant at the moment of his death, since such a posthumous child, regardless of its sex, would have displaced Victoria from the throne. Adelaide was 44 at the time, so pregnancy was possible even if unlikely.\n\nDaughters (and their lines) may inherit titles that descend according to male-preference primogeniture, but only in default of sons (and their heirs). That is, both female and male offspring have the right to a place somewhere in the order of succession, but when it comes to what that place is, a female will rank behind her brothers regardless of their ages or her age.\n\nThus, normally, even an only daughter will not be heir apparent, since at any time a brother might be born who, though younger, would assume that position. Hence, she is an heir presumptive. For example, Queen Elizabeth II was heir presumptive during the reign of her father, King George VI, because at any stage up to his death, George could have fathered a legitimate son.\n\nIn a system of absolute primogeniture that disregards gender, female heirs apparent occur. As succession to titles, positions, or offices in the past most often favoured males than females, females considered to be an heir apparent were rare. Absolute primogeniture was not practised by any modern monarchy for succession to their thrones until the late twentieth century with Sweden being the first to adopt absolute primogeniture in 1980 and other Western European monarchies following suit.\n\nSince the adoption of absolute primogeniture by contemporary Western European monarchies, examples of female heirs apparent include: Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden, Princess Catharina-Amalia of the Netherlands, and Princess Elisabeth of Belgium; these, respectively the oldest children of Kings Carl XVI Gustaf, Willem-Alexander, and Philippe. Princess Ingrid Alexandra of Norway is heir apparent to her father (who is heir apparent to the Norwegian throne), and Victoria herself has a female heir apparent in her oldest child, Princess Estelle. Victoria was not heir apparent from birth (in 1977), but gained the status in 1980 following a change in the Swedish Act of Succession. Her younger brother Carl Philip (born 1979) was thus heir apparent for a few months (and is a rare example of an heir apparent losing this status without a death occurring).\n\nIn 2015, pursuant to the 2011 Perth Agreement, the Commonwealth realms changed the rules of succession to the 16 thrones of Elizabeth II to absolute primogeniture, except for male heirs born before the Perth Agreement. The effects are not likely to be felt for many years; the first two heirs at the time of the agreement (Charles, Prince of Wales, and his son Prince William, Duke of Cambridge) were already eldest born children, and in 2013, William's first-born son Prince George of Cambridge became the next apparent successor.\n\nBut even in legal systems that apply male-preference primogeniture, female heirs apparent are by no means impossible: if a male heir apparent dies leaving no sons but at least one daughter, then the eldest daughter would replace her father as heir apparent to whatever throne or title is concerned, but only when it has become clear that the widow of the deceased is not pregnant. Then, as the representative of her father's line she would assume a place ahead of any more distant relatives. Such a situation has not to date occurred with the English or British throne; several times an heir apparent has died, but each example has either been childless or left a son or sons. However, there have been several female heirs apparent to British peerages (e.g. Frances Ward, 6th Baroness Dudley, and Henrietta Wentworth, 6th Baroness Wentworth).\n\nIn one special case, however, England and Scotland had a female heir apparent. The Revolution settlement that established William and Mary as joint monarchs in 1689 only gave the power to continue the succession through issue to Mary II, eldest daughter of the previous king, James II. William, by contrast, was to reign for life only, and his (hypothetical) children by a wife other than Mary would be placed in his original place (as Mary's first cousin) in the line of succession – after Mary's younger sister Anne. Thus, although after Mary's death William continued to reign, he had no power to beget direct heirs, and Anne became the heir apparent for the remainder of William's reign. She eventually succeeded him as Queen of England, Scotland and Ireland.\n\nThe position of an heir apparent is normally unshakable: it can be assumed they will inherit. Sometimes, however, extraordinary events—such as the death or the deposition of the parent—intervene.\n\n\nIn some jurisdictions, an heir apparent can automatically lose that status by breaching certain constitutional rules. Today, for example:\n\n\n"}

Although prohibited by the laws of many countries, there have been many reported cases of necrophilia throughout history.\n\nIncidents of necrophilia are noted to have occurred throughout history. Greek author Herodotus (c.484–425 BC) stated in his \"Histories\" that in Ancient Egypt, bodies of exceptionally beautiful women were not embalmed immediately after their deaths, but only after several days had passed, in order to prevent a recurrence of a case where it was discovered that an embalmer had sex with the body of a recently dead woman.\n\nAccording to the Babylonian Talmud (3rd–5th centuries AD), King Herod of Judea (73/74 BC – 4 BC) desired a certain maiden and, after she killed herself to avoid marrying him, preserved her body in honey for seven years. Some say that he embalmed her in order to have intercourse with her; others say that he did not have intercourse with her. Roman-Jewish historian Flavius Josephus (37 – c. 100 AD), whose works are the main source for Herod's life and character, says nothing about any necrophilia on his part.\n\nRemains of pottery from the Moche civilization represent dead skeletal figures engaged in sexual intercourse with living humans.\n\nGilles de Rais is noted to have sexually violated the dead bodies of his victims.\n\nAccording to criminologist Herschel Prins, it was said that until the 19th century, if a betrothed girl in Central Europe died before her marriage day, the spouse could still carry out the ceremony by copulating with the body.\n\nDuring the 18th-century conflict of Peru between rebels of Tupac Amaru and Colonial forces, rebels had sex with dead women.\n\nIn the 19th-century Russo-Turkish war, military forces sexually abused dead bodies.\n\nDuring the Moroccan War of 1919–1926, necrophilia was committed by the troops.\n\nA Chinese man was killed during the Nanking Massacre, after he refused to have sex with dead women.\n\nDuring the Rwandan Genocide, sex with dead bodies was reported.\n\nArthur Shawcross, an American serial killer from Rochester, New York, had also practiced necrophilia. Shawcross (also known as the Genesee River Killer) was convicted of 11 murders in November 1990. He claimed to have killed, raped, decapitated, and eaten two Vietcong women during a tour of Vietnam with the 4th Supply and Transport Company of the 4th Infantry Division in 1968, during the Vietnam War. He reportedly also committed necrophilic sexual acts and mutilations on his victims in Rochester between 1988 and 1989. All but one were prostitutes from the area. Shawcross received two separate life sentences in Monroe County, NY and Wayne County, NY respectively.\n\n\n"}

This was the first time leaders of the Roman Church and the Moscow Patriarchate had met. While the meeting was also seen as a symbolic moment in the history of relations between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox churches as a community, which had split in the Great Schism of 1054, centuries before the Moscow Patriarchate was constituted, it was not expected to lead to any immediate rapprochement between them.\n\nThe 30-point declaration contains a joint call by the two church primates for an end to the persecution of Christians in the Middle East and to wars in the region, expressing their hope that the meeting might contribute to the re-establishment of Christian unity between the two churches. A range of other issues are mentioned in the declaration, including atheism, secularism, consumerism, migrants and refugees, the importance of marriage and the family, and concerns relating to abortion and euthanasia.\n\nAccording to the ROC leadership′s public statements made prior and after the Havana meeting, while the document stresses that both churches share the Tradition of the first millennium of Christianity, the discussion during the meeting did not attempt to mend any of the persisting doctrinal and ecclesiastical differences between the two churches. The Declaration however includes statements about Eastern Catholic Churches in line with the Balamand declaration as well as the conflict in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church expressed disappointment and Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate criticised the latter.\n\nThe Great Schism of 1054 split Christianity between Greek East and Latin West. Attempts were made over the subsequent centuries to heal the rift, such as the 1274 Second Council of Lyon and the 1439 Council of Florence, but these failed. More recent attempts to foster closer relations between the churches included the Catholic–Orthodox Joint Declaration of 1965 following the 1964 meeting between Pope Paul VI and the Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I of Constantinople in Jerusalem. Following that meeting and declaration, a number of meetings, visits and symbolic events had taken place involving Catholic and Orthodox leaders (including visits by Pope John Paul II, and especially between several popes and Bartholomew I of Constantinople), but never a meeting between a Pope and a leader of the Russian Orthodox Church. The first time a Pope visited a predominantly Eastern Orthodox country was in 1999 when Pope John Paul II visited Romania. Since 1980, regular plenary sessions of the Joint International Commission for Theological Dialogue Between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church, the latter being led by the Church of Constantinople, had been held.\n\nWithin the communion of the autocephalous (administratively independent) local (national) churches of Orthodoxy, the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople – based in what is now Turkey's Istanbul – is recognized as the bishop who enjoys primus inter pares status, albeit having no direct administrative powers over the other Orthodox churches. The Russian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) which became autocephalous near the end of the 16th century is considered the largest denomination of the local Orthodox churches; it has close ties with the Russian state, thus according a geopolitical significance to a meeting of its Patriarch with a pope. The decentralised nature of Orthodoxy meant that such meeting could not have direct significance for pan-Orthodox issues. Two weeks earlier, the leaders of the Orthodox churches, including Kirill, met in Chambésy, Switzerland, to make final preparations for a historic Great and Holy Council of the Orthodox Church, re-scheduled for June 2016.\n\nAccording to the , it began bilateral dialogue with the Catholic Church in 1967 and the began theological dialogue with the Catholic Church in 1979.\nAttempts had previously been made to arrange a meeting between a pope and a Russian patriarch, but these attempts had failed. Tensions had risen between the churches after the fall of Communism as the Churches \"moved to pick up the pieces\". Negotiations had been held in the 1990s for a possible meeting between Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow and Pope John Paul II. According to the United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, the two churches established a joint working group, which met in May and September 2004, to discuss specific concerns. Representatives of both churches reported that the working group contributed to an improved atmosphere. In an August 2004 gesture of reconciliation, John Paul II presented an 18th-century copy of the icon of Our Lady of Kazan to Alexy II. \nIn April 2005, John Paul II died and Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger was elected as Pope Benedict XVI.\nIn April 2005, Bishop Hilarion Alfeyev, as chairman of the Representation of the Russian Orthodox Church to the European Institutions, proposed \"a European Catholic–Orthodox Alliance\".\nIn May 2005, Cardinal Walter Kasper proposed convoking \"a synod of reconciliation\" on the 1,000-year anniversary of the Council of Bari in 2098, and proposed an alliance with Orthodox and Protestants against secularism. This alliance would \"help one another mutually in favor of common values, of a culture of life, of the dignity of the person, of solidarity and social justice, of peace and the safeguarding of creation,\" according to Kasper.\nIn May, then-Metropolitan Kirill met with Benedict XVI in the Vatican, and they highlighted their commitment to working cooperatively. The possibility of a meeting of Kirill (elected Patriarch in 2009) with Benedict XVI had been explored prior to Benedict's retirement in March 2013, and Benedict met the future Patriarch Kirill in Rome in 2006 when Kirill was chairman of the Department of External Church Relations for the Moscow Patriarchate.\n\nTwo years of secretive planning and months of detailed negotiation were necessary to arrange the meeting between Francis and Kirill. Francis was willing to meet Kirill, having said in November 2014: \"I'll go wherever you want. You call me and I'll go.\" Agreement from the Russian Orthodox side was complicated over the church's close ties to the Russian state and international tensions over Russia's intervention in Crimea and Ukraine. The pre-meeting announcement from the Moscow Patriarchate stated that they had agreed to \"put aside internal disagreements\" in order to focus on the plight of Christians being persecuted. Cuba, a location that was significant to both sides, provided the requirements for a neutral meeting place as neither Rome nor Moscow would have been suitable. The meeting, made possible by the timing of both leaders' visits to the region, was announced a week in advance on 5 February 2016.\n\nThe meeting took place on 12 February 2016 in a VIP room at José Martí International Airport near Havana, Cuba. Francis arrived at 2 pm local time, and the two leaders embraced and kissed. A 2-hour private meeting was followed by the signing of their joint declaration, which had been prepared in advance. Kirill was in Havana on an official visit as part of a tour of the region, including visits to Brazil and Paraguay. Francis' airplane arrived at the airport on his way to his tour of Mexico.\n\nCuban dignitaries attending the occasion included President Raúl Castro, Cardinal Jaime Lucas Ortega y Alamino (Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Cristóbal de la Habana) and Archbishop (of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santiago de Cuba). The meeting itself was held in a private room and attended by translators and by the aides of the two leaders, in addition to Cardinal Kurt Koch, president of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, and Metropolitan Hilarion Alfeyev, chairman of the Department of External Church Relations for the Moscow Patriarchate.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, there was an exchange of gifts. Francis gave Kirill a chalice as well as a reliquary of the 9th-century Saint Cyril (buried in Rome). Kirill gave Francis a copy of the icon of the Our Lady of Kazan. Other presents exchanged were a Spanish-language translation of Kirill's book \"Freedom and Responsibility\" (2011) and a Russian-language translation of Francis's encyclical \"Laudato si'\" (2015).\n\nSpeaking to news media several days after the meeting, Patriarch Kirill said, citing as the reason ″powerful forces″ opposing such meeting (apart from the fearful Orthodox faithful), that the meeting had had to be prepared in strict secrecy; he also stressed that not a single theological issue had been discussed.\n\nThe joint declaration was published by the Vatican in Italian, Russian, English, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese and Arabic. The Russian Orthodox Church published it in Russian, English, Italian, French, Spanish and Ukrainian. It consisted of 30 numbered sections on a range of topics.\n\nThe first section of the declaration gives thanks for this meeting \"the first in history\" and refers to the leaders as \"brothers in the Christian faith\". Sections 2 and 3 refers to their meeting place of Cuba as \"the crossroads of North and South, East and West\", and expressed joy at the growth of Christianity in Latin America. Sections 4–6 expresses their views on their shared spiritual tradition (\"the first millennium of Christianity\") and their hopes that their meeting \"may contribute to the re–establishment of this unity willed by God\".\n\nSections 7–21 refer to \"the challenges of the contemporary world\". Issues raised include the persecution of Christians in the Middle East and North Africa; the impact of civil war, chaos and terrorist violence; the exodus of Christians from Syria and Iraq; and the suffering experienced by the faithful of other religious traditions. The declaration refers to the renewal of the Christian faith in Russia and Eastern Europe and the \"breaking of the chains of militant atheism\", the rise of secularism, consumerism, inequality, migrants and refugees, and the place of Christianity in the process of European integration. Further sections emphasise the importance of the family, of marriage between one man and one woman, and their concerns relating to abortion, euthanasia, and \"biomedical reproduction technology\".\n\nThe issues of the schism within the Orthodox community in Ukraine, the conflict between Ukraine′s Catholics and the Orthodox, and the political situation in Ukraine are raised in sections 25–27.\n\nThe closing sections call on Catholics and Orthodox to \"work together fraternally in proclaiming the Good News of salvation\" and to \"give shared witness to the Spirit of truth in these difficult times\".\n\nThe declaration concludes with a prayer to Mary, who is invoked by the names of the \"Blessed Virgin Mary\" as well as \"Holy Mother of God\".\n\nThe meeting was characterised by news media commentators, who were largely uninformed of the pivotal facts concerning the history of Christianity in Russia and tending toward sensationalism, as being \"historic\", \"richly symbolic\", and as the \"meeting of the millennium\". Analysts also opine that the meeting had a geopolitical dimension, being about rivalries among Orthodox leaders, long-standing tensions within Ukrainian Orthodoxy, and about Russian President Vladimir Putin asserting Russia's influence on the world stage, motivated by his actions in Syria and Ukraine. Overall, the meeting was \"not expected to lead to any immediate rapprochement between the Eastern and Western Churches\".\n\nKirill has faced criticism over his policies that have brought the Russian Orthodox Church closer to the Russian state. In the 2012 Russian presidential election he supported Vladimir Putin, likening Putin's presidency to \"a miracle from God\". Yury Avvakumov, assistant professor of theology at the University of Notre Dame, describes the Moscow Patriarchate as \"an instrument of Russian international policy an effective transmitter worldwide of the political interests of the Russian rulers.\" The view that the meeting was motivated by internal Orthodox politics was expressed by George Demacopoulos, Greek-Orthodox chairman of Orthodox Christian studies at Fordham University in New York: \"This isn't benevolence. It's not a newfound desire for Christian unity [...] It is almost entirely about (Kirill) posturing and trying to present himself as the leader of Orthodoxy.\"\n\nSimilar views are expressed by Borys Gudziak (Ukrainian Catholic Eparchial Bishop of Paris), who states that \"the two protagonists in this drama come to it bearing different legacies. Francis is the leader of a billion Catholics and is the single most respected moral authority in the world. Kirill is the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, which is still limping from a century of persecution and still looking for its moral voice in post-Soviet Russian society.\" Gudziak also highlighted the internal tensions in Orthodoxy, and that an independent Ukrainian Orthodox Church would greatly reduce the power of the Russian Orthodox Church. He pointed out the tensions arising from the impending Pan-Orthodox council in June, the first to be held in centuries. In addition to this, Patriarch Kirill may face opposition from conservative groups in Russian Orthodoxy opposed to closer ties with the Catholic Church.\n\nUS Jesuit priest Robert F. Taft credits the new approach by Francis for creating the conditions needed for the meeting, opining that \"Russia is coming to understand that the Catholic Church sees them as a sister church, not as someone who separated from the only real Church.\" The \"New York Times\" states that for Francis, \"the meeting was an ecumenical and diplomatic coup that eluded his predecessors\", but that he could face criticism for indirectly providing support for the Russian military intervention in Syria and Ukraine. The Associated Press report states that the meeting \"cemented Francis' reputation as a risk-taking statesman who values dialogue, bridge-building and rapprochement at almost any cost\", but adds that he \"has also come under criticism for essentially allowing himself to be used by a Russia eager to assert itself\". When asked about the possibility of being the first pope to visit Russia and China, Francis pointed to his heart and said: \"China and Russia, I have them here. Pray.\"\n\nAccording to \"The Economist\", the meeting was a diplomatic victory for Russia's government: \"The [pope's] meeting with his Russian counterpart drew Francis deep into geopolitics, and led him to condone Russia's foreign policy and critique the West's in ways that infuriated some of the Catholic church's supporters\".\n\nMajor Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk, of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, says he was disappointed and his church members felt \"betrayed by the Vatican\" over the declaration's stance regarding Ukraine. Nonetheless, Shevchuk asks, \"all not to rush in judging , not to remain on the reality level of those who expect only politics from this meeting and want to exploit a humble pope for their human plans at all costs. If we don't enter into the spiritual reality of the Holy Father and do not discern together with him the action of the Holy Spirit, we shall remain imprisoned by the prince of this world and his followers.\" The nuncio to Ukraine, , called for patience and indicated that the declaration was a compromise statement.\n\nThe Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate also criticised the declaration; it states that the declaration ignores the opinion and position of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. It also protests that the declaration had not stated that the War in Donbass was a Russian military intervention in Ukraine. In a press conference on 18 February 2016, Francis explained that questions like who started the \"state of war in Ukraine\" was a \"historical problem\".\n\nAccording to official documents, the most important goal of the Orthodox Church in relations with non-Orthodox confessions is the restoration of the God-commanded Christian unity. Indifference to this task or its rejection is a sin against Jesus' command of unity. Among the duties of the Holy Synod are to: \"evaluate major events in the inter-church, inter-confessional and interreligious relations,\" \"maintain inter-confessional and interreligious relations,\" \"coordinate the actions of\" the \"in its efforts to reach peace and justice,\" and \"express pastoral concern for social problems.\"\n\nNevertheless, some members have questioned the orthodoxy of the Francis–Kirill meeting and preparations for the 2016 Pan-Orthodox Council. There are \"some religious nationalists\" in Belarus, Moldova, and the Russian Federation who have been \"stirred into action\" by the Francis–Kirill meeting and \"some conservative clerics and monasteries have reacted to the\" meeting and joint declaration \"by ceasing their public prayers for Kirill.\" Kirill had reformed the administration of the and consolidated authority in the patriarch.\nAccording to , Kirill \"has no obvious enemies in the episcopate\" but some \"marginal figures\" in the clergy are enemies.\nSome priests have criticized Kirill and called his acts heretical. For example, Archpriest Vladislav Emelyanov said that the Francis–Kirill meeting \"evokes a feeling of betrayal\" and that Kirill was destroying conciliarity in the by first replacing local synod bishops and then not consulting fellow bishops in such a serious matter. This was, in Emelyanov opinion, \"clear Papism.\" The has called Emelyanov's statement \"harmful and unreasonable.\" Priest Alexei Morozov said that the was on the verge of a split and he encouraged members to dissent in two ways: by attending \"temples, where priests strictly adhere to the tenets of Christianity and do not accept heresy papacy and ecumenism\" and by asking the Moscow Patriarchate to convene the Local Council of the Russian Orthodox Church to condemn what Morozov believes are heresies.\nAccording to \"newsru.com\", the sentiments expressed by Emelyanov and Morozov are not sensationalism but exist among some members of the . Chapnin points out that \"there exist fundamentalist groups, radically Orthodox in disposition, who condemn any rapprochement\" between the and the Catholic Church.\nChapnin thinks that the fundamentalist rhetoric is \"very emotional and of little substance.\"\n\nThe Holy Synod of the Moldovan Orthodox Church published an appeal addressed to those who omit Kirill from their public prayers.\n\nKirill's spokesman, Priest , said these reactions stemmed from the fact that \"people have not fully understood what occurred.\"\nThe deputy chairman of the (DECR), Archimandrite , noted \"that the vast majority\" of members accepted the meeting and the results positively. Bulekov said that the did not disregard the criticisms of the Francis–Kirill meeting by some Orthodox and answered most questions about what happened. Bulekov commented that in most cases the same people made critical remarks and \"if not for this meeting, there would be other reasons for such statements.\"\n\nMetropolitan Hilarion Alfeyev told Russian News Agency TASS that critics of dialogue who consider Christian disunity to be normal hold a fallacious position against Jesus' command, in , that they all may be one. Alfeyev pointed out that this command had been broken and this condition is wrong and sinful. The purpose of the dialogue is reflected in the joint statement and is not intended to overcome division and differences, according to Alfayev.\n\nMetropolitan pointed out that the declaration does not contain any doctrinal agreements or concessions from Orthodoxy to Catholicism. The presence of Western saints in the Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar, Viktorin points out, is evidence of a millennium of common doctrine. It declares a \"common Christian understanding of values\" together with a \"desire to follow them,\" according to Metropolitan , and \"does not concern dogmatic matters\". \"It would be a great mistake,\" Mercurius said, \"to stop conversing with each other and to throw stones at one another.\"\n"}
{"id": "12476895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12476895", "title": "Libertarian conservatism", "text": "Libertarian conservatism\n\nLibertarian conservatism or conservative libertarianism is a political philosophy and ideology that combines right-libertarian politics and conservative values. Libertarian conservatism advocates the greatest possible economic liberty and the least possible government regulation of social life, mirroring \"laissez-faire\" liberalism, but harnesses this to a belief in a more traditional and conservative social philosophy emphasizing authority and duty. Libertarian conservatism prioritizes liberty as its main emphasis, promoting free expression, freedom of choice and free market capitalism to achieve socially and culturally conservative ends as they reject liberal social engineering, or in the opposite way but not excluding the above, libertarian conservatism could be understood as promoting civil society through conservative institutions and authority - as family, fatherland, religion, education - in the quest of libertarian ends for less state power.\n\nFor Larry Johnston, in political science, the term \"libertarian conservatism\" is used to refer to ideologies that combine the advocacy of economic principles such as fiscal discipline, respect for contracts, defense of private property and free markets and the traditional conservative stress on self-help and freedom of choice under a \"laissez-faire\" and economically liberal capitalist society with social tenets such as the importance of religion and the value of traditional morality through a framework of limited, constitutional, representative government.\n\nFor Margaret Randall, libertarian conservatism began as an expression of individualism and the demand for personal freedom. \n\n\"Freedom and Virtue: The Conservative/Libertarian Debate\", edited by George W. Carey, contains essays which describe \"the tension between liberty and morality\" as \"the main fault line dividing the two philosophies\".\n\nNelson Hultberg wrote that there is \"philosophical common ground\" between libertarians and conservatives. \"The true conservative movement was, from the start, a blend of political libertarianism, cultural conservatism, and non-interventionism abroad bequeathed to us via the Founding Fathers\". He said that such libertarian conservatism was \"hijacked\" by neoconservatism, \"by the very enemies it was formed to fight – Fabians, New Dealers, welfarists, progressives, globalists, interventionists, militarists, nation builders, and all the rest of the collectivist ilk that was assiduously working to destroy the Founders' Republic of States\".\n\nThomas DiLorenzo wrote that libertarian conservative constitutionalists believe that the way to limit government is to enforce the United States Constitution. However, DiLorenzo criticized them by writing: \"The fatal flaw in the thinking of the libertarian/conservative constitutionalists stems from their unawareness or willful ignorance of how the founders themselves believed the Constitution could be enforced: by the citizens of the free, independent, and sovereign states, not the federal judiciary\". He wrote that the powers accrued to the federal government during the American Civil War overthrew the Constitution of 1787.\n\nIn the 1950's Frank Meyer, a prominent contributor to the \"National Review\", called his own combination libertarianism and conservatism as \"fusionism\".\n\nIn the 1990s, Lew Rockwell, Murray Rothbard and others described their libertarian conservative views as paleolibertarianism. They continued libertarian opposition to \"all forms of government intervention – economic, cultural, social, international\", but also upholding cultural conservatism in social thought and behavior. They opposed a licentious libertarianism which advocated \"freedom from bourgeois morality, and social authority\". Rockwell later stated that they dropped that self-description because people confused it with paleoconservatism, which they rejected.\n\nLaurence M. Vance wrote: \"Some libertarians consider libertarianism to be a lifestyle rather than a political philosophy... They apparently don't know the difference between libertarianism and libertinism\".\n\nFriedrich Hayek, Ludwig von Mises, Milton Friedman, Richard Posner, Richard Epstein and Albert Jay Nock have been described as libertarian conservatives. Former U.S. Congressman Ron Paul and his son U.S. Senator Rand Paul have been described as combining libertarian and conservative \"small government\" ideas and showing how the Constitution defends the individual and most libertarian views.\n\nIn 1975, Ronald Reagan stated: \"I believe the very heart and soul of conservatism is libertarianism\". However, some libertarians criticized Reagan for un-libertarian policy positions.\n\nEdward Feser emphasized that libertarianism does not require individuals to reject traditional conservative values. Libertarianism supports the ideas of liberty, privacy and ending the war on marijuana at the legal level without changing personal values.\n\nLibertarian conservatism subscribes to the libertarian idea of free market capitalism, advocating minimal to no government interference in the market. A number of libertarian conservatives favor Austrian economics and are critical of fiat money, with many supporting policies like pay what you want cafes. Libertarian conservatives also advocate for ways to privatize services run by the government, from airports to toll booths.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1762101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1762101", "title": "List of enacting clauses", "text": "List of enacting clauses\n\nAn enacting clause, or enacting formula, is a short phrase that introduces the main provisions of a law enacted by a legislature. It usually declares the source from which the law claims to derive its authority. In many countries, an enacting formula is not considered necessary and is simply omitted.\n\nThe simplest enacting clauses merely cite the legislature by which the law has been adopted; for example the enacting clause used in Australia since 1990 is \"The Parliament of Australia enacts\". Alternatively an enacting clause may invoke the ultimate sovereign. For example, California, based on the principle of popular sovereignty, has the following enacting clause: \"The People of the State of California do enact as follows.\"\n\nParliament of Antigua and Barbuda:\nCongress of Argentina:\n\nParliament of Australia:\n\nFor constitutional amendments passed at a referendum:\n\nBefore October 1990:\n1901–?:\nNational Council:\n\nParliament of Barbados:\n1969: \n\nParliament of the Bahamas:\n\nIn Belgium the enacting formula appears in the official journal (Belgisch Staatsbald/Moniteur belgue) when the law is promulgated and published, but is usually thereafter not included when the law is printed in compilations, or stored in internet databases, even official ones. The enacting clause is as follows.\n\nParliament of Belize:\n\nNational Congress of Brazil:\n\nIn Brazil the presidential assent to a bill is called \"sanction\". After passing both Houses of Congress (the Chamber of Deputies and the Federal Senate), the final version of the bill, duly signed by the presiding officers of both Houses, is sent to the President of the Republic. The document is still called a \"proposed law\", with a bill number, and with the header \"The National Congress decrees:\" (In Portuguese: \"O Congresso Nacional decreta:\"). If the President approves the bill, a different copy of the act is prepared by the Presidency of the Republic, with the official number of the Law and the date of enactment of the law, and also with the replacement of the clause \"The National Congress decrees:\" with the above mentioned formula \"THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC: I make it known that the National Congress decrees and I sanction the following Law:\". The signatures of the presiding officers of Congress are therefore not present in this version of the act. This is the version of the statute that is published in the Official Journal and that is included in the statute books. When granting his approval to a bill, the President signs both the bill sent to him by Congress and the final version of the statute with the presidential enacting formula. The signed Bill is returned to Congress by means of a presidential message; the signed statute with the presidential enacting formula is printed in the Official Journal, and the original is thereafter sent to the National Archive.\nThus, in Brazil, the President is always seen signing two different documents at bill signing ceremony (the two documents are called the \"autographs\"): one is the text of the proposed law, the other is the final text of the statute. Technically, the first signature (on the Bill) is the \"sanction to the proposed law\", that is, the approval of the bill, that transforms it in a Law, and the second signature (on the statute with the presidential enacting formula) is the promulgation, the announcement to the people that the Law has been adopted. While the signature of the President on the bill includes the addition of the formula \"I sanction it\" (in Portuguese: \"Sanciono\") above the signature, this is not seen in the final \"promulgation\" version of the statute. On the other hand, the promulgated statute contains not only the signature of the president, but also the countersignatures of his ministers principally charged with applying the law.\n\nWhen the president vetoes a bill, and the veto is overridden, the Bill is returned by Congress to the President not for sanction (approval), but merely for promulgation. In that case, the president is expected to promulgate the bill in 48 hours. In that situation, the enacting formula that appears in the final text of the adopted statute is as follows:\n\nTacit sanction (i.e. implicit approval) is deemed to take place if the president fails to sign or veto a bill within the constitutionally mandated timeframe of fifteen working days from receiving the bill. Once the bill is considered implicitlly sanctioned, the president is expected to promulgate the new law and the same 48-hour timeframe applies. The formula in this case is:\n\nShould the president refuse to promulgate, or fail to promulgate in the period of 48 hours, a bill, after his veto has been overridden by Congress, then the authority to promulgate the bill passes to the President of the Senate. In that case, the formula of promulgation is:\n\nShould the president of the Republic refuse to promulgate, or fail to promulgate in the period of 48 hours, a bill, after the bill has been implicitly sanctioned due to his failure to sign or veto it within the constitutionally mandated timeframe, then the authority to promulgate the bill passes to the President of the Senate. In that case, the formula of promulgation is:\n\nWhenever the president adopts a provisional measure and the provisional measure is approved by Congress with changes, a normal bill is sent to the president for approval or veto, and the same formulas used for other bills are employed; once enacted, the new statute replaces the provisional measure. However, if the provisional measure adopted by the president is approved by Congress without changes, the bill does not need to be presented for approval or veto; in that case, the law that both corresponds fully to the provisional measure and replaces it is promulgated directly by the President of the Senate, with the following words:\n\nGeneral Assembly of the Empire of Brazil (1822-1889)\n\nWhenever the General Assembly of the Empire (made up of a Senate and of a Chamber of Deputies) passed a bill, a decree of the General Assembly containing the articles of the approved bill was sent to the Emperor for sanction or veto. The Decree of the General Assembly began with the following formula (that did not appear in the final version of the statute, after the imperial sanction): \"\"The General Assembly decrees:\" (in Portuguese: \"A Assembleia Geral decreta:\"). The decree was still only a proposed law, that would become an actual law if sanctioned by the Emperor. The General Assembly sent its decree to the Emperor for sanction or veto by means of a message with the words following: \"The General Assembly sends to the Emperor the enclosed decree, that it considers advantageous, and useful to the Empire, and it asks that His Imperial Majesty may be pleased to grant it His sanction\" (in Portuguese: \"A Assembleia Geral dirige ao Imperador o decreto incluso, que julga vantajoso e útil ao Império, e pede a Sua Majestade Imperial, se digne dar a Sua sanção\"). If the Emperor decided to sanction the decree, then he sent the message of the General Assembly back to the Legislature, adding after the text of the Decree of the General Assembly the following words, together with the date and his signature: \"\"The Emperor consents\" (in Portuguese: \"O Imperador consente\"\"). Then, the Executive branch prepared a formal document to promulgate the new law, and this document was known in the imperial period as a \"Charter of Law\" (in Portuguese: \"Carta de Lei\"). It was the chartered version of the law that was included in the statute books and that was printed and published for the knowledge of the people. Thus, the Charter of Law was the final version of the statute as adopted.

It sought to require a background check for virtually all gun transfers in Maine, with some exceptions. As the Maine Legislature and Governor Paul LePage declined to enact the proposal as written, it appeared on the ballot along with elections for President of the United States, Maine's two United States House seats, the Maine Legislature, other statewide ballot questions, and various local elections.\n\nThe question was defeated, with 51.8% of voters opposed.\n\nEfforts to expand background checks of gun buyers have not succeeded at the Maine State House. In 2013, an effort to create a civil penalty of someone not conducting a background check on a buyer later found to not be allowed to possess a gun passed the Maine Legislature, but was vetoed by Governor Paul LePage, a strong gun rights supporter. An outright requirement to conduct background checks on gun buyers in private sales failed to pass the Legislature that same year.\n\nOn August 24, 2015, the group Maine Moms Demand Action (MMDA) filed paperwork with the Maine Secretary of State's office to launch a petition drive to require virtually all gun sales to have a background check of the buyer conducted by a licensed gun dealer. The proposal includes exceptions for transfers between family members, temporary loans of firearms while hunting or sport shooting, an emergency need for self-defense, and other limited exceptions.\n\nMMDA submitted the 84,600 signatures they gathered on January 19, 2016. The Secretary of State's office announced on February 18 that 65,821 signatures were validated, well over the 61,123 required to place a question on the ballot. The question will appear on the ballot as \"Do you want to require background checks prior to the sale or transfer of firearms between individuals not licensed as firearms dealers, with failure to do so punishable by law, and with some exceptions for family members, hunting, self-defense, lawful competitions, and shooting range activity?\"\n\nGun rights supporters criticized the proposal. The Sportsman's Alliance of Maine's executive director, David Trahan, stated that while background checks sound good in theory, they are difficult to implement and enforce, which is why there has been no national universal background check system. He also criticized the potential involvement of Michael Bloomberg and other out-of-state gun control groups spending large amounts of money in Maine. State Senator Eric Brakey criticized the effort as a back-door attempt to establish a gun registry.\n\nSupporters officially launched their campaign on May 14, 2016, calling themselves Mainers for Responsible Gun Ownership. The group includes law enforcement officials, gun violence survivors, sportsmen, gun owners and gun violence prevention advocates. They state that background checks will close a loophole in existing gun laws which allow criminals, domestic abusers, and the mentally ill to obtain guns without a background check by not going to a licensed dealer. They also claim that states with expansive background checks experience lower rates of women being shot to death by their intimate partners, as well as lower rates of police officers being killed by handguns.\n\nGovernor Paul LePage, in expressing opposition to the referendum, called it unconstitutional. Referendum supporters cite a 2007 decision written by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia stating that background checks are constitutional.\n\nThe Maine Warden Service, while not officially opposing the referendum, expressed concern that its passage \"could make criminals out of responsible firearm owners\" and that it would be difficult to enforce.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25240682", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25240682", "title": "Martinez v. Court of Appeal of California", "text": "Martinez v. Court of Appeal of California\n\nMartinez v. Court of Appeal of California, 528 U.S. 152 (2000), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court decided an appellant who was the defendant in a criminal case cannot refuse the assistance of counsel on direct appeals. This case is in contrast to \"Faretta v. California\", 422 U.S. 806 (1975), which grants criminal defendants the right to refuse counsel for trial purposes.\n\nSalvador Martinez worked as an office assistant for a law firm, and in the service of that firm he was given $6,000 by the girlfriend of a client for bail. This bail was not posted, and he was accused of embezzlement and theft, and further was convicted and acquitted respectively on these charges. He filed an appeal, a waiver of counsel, and a motion to represent himself (a \"pro se\" motion). When the Court of Appeals of California rejected the \"pro se\" motion, he appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the argument.\n\nThe counsel for the appellant, Ronald Maines, argued that due process coupled with the decision in \"Faretta\" required the extension of a constitutional right for criminal defendants to refuse to have a court-appointed lawyer argue the appeal, thus requiring the right to extend further to allow criminal defendants to argue their own appeals. This would require any appellant who was a criminal defendant to be allowed, given that the court opted for oral arguments, to be allowed to argue their own case as a constitutional right.\n\nThe argument of the counsel for the appellee, Robert Foster, held that there were substantial differences between initial trials and appeals courts, therefore the extension of \"Faretta\" to the current question was overreaching. Mr. Maines contended that there must be more than simple \"differentiation\" between the two situations, but there must be a difference consequential to the holding in \"Faretta\" to distinguish the trial and appellate situations.\n\nJustice Stevens states in the opinion that \"Our conclusion in \"Faretta\" extended only to a defendant’s “constitutional right to conduct his own defense.”\" Stevens affirms the decision of the lower court that \"There is no constitutional right to self-representation on the initial appeal as of right.\" This rejects the claim that the right to forgo representation of separate counsel at the appellate level was granted by due process and the Fourteenth Amendment. The court also rejected the notion that court-appointed lawyers would be disloyal to their clients, thus preventing a fair appellate proceeding. Further, since the court rejects this application of the Sixth Amendment to appellate proceedings, then that cannot be held as a claim for the conclusion that a person has the right to represent themselves upon direct appeal. Thus, the opinion of Justice Stevens dismissed not just the Due process claims and the precedent claims of the \"Faretta\" decision, but also the potential future claims under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\nJustice Scalia, in a concurrence, suggests that the decision in \"Faretta\" does not apply strictly to the question before the court since in the case \"McKane v. Durston\", 153 U.S. 684-688 (1894), the court decided that \"there was no constitutional right to an appeal.\"\n"}
{"id": "6305266", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6305266", "title": "Master–slave dialectic", "text": "Master–slave dialectic\n\nThe master–slave dialectic is the common name for a famous passage of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's \"Phenomenology of Spirit\", though the original German phrase, \"Herrschaft und Knechtschaft\", is more properly translated as Lordship and Bondage. It is widely considered a key element in Hegel's philosophical system, and has heavily influenced many subsequent philosophers.\n\nThe passage describes, in narrative form, the development of self-consciousness as such in an encounter between what are thereby (i.e., emerging only from this encounter) two distinct, self-conscious beings. The essence of the dialectic is the movement or motion of recognizing, in which the two self-consciousnesses are constituted in being each recognized as self-conscious by the other. This movement, inexorably taken to its extreme, takes the form of a \"struggle to the death\" in which one masters the other, only to find that such lordship makes the very recognition he had sought impossible, since the bondsman, in this state, is not free to offer it.\n\n\"Independent and Dependent Self-Consciousness: Lordship and Bondage\" is the first of two titled subsections in the \"Self-Consciousness\" chapter of \"Phenomenology\". It is preceded in the chapter by a discussion of \"Life\" and \"Desire\", among other things, and is followed by \"Free Self-Consciousness: Stoicism, Skepticism, and the Unhappy Consciousness\".\n\nHegel wrote this story or myth in order to explain his idea of how self-consciousness dialectically sublates into what he variously refers to as Absolute Knowledge, Spirit, and Science. As a work, the \"Phenomenology\" may be considered both as an independent work, apparently considered by Hegel to be an \"a priori\" for understanding the \"Science of Logic\", and as a part of the \"Science of Logic\", where Hegel discusses absolute knowledge.\n\nCrucially, for Hegel, absolute knowledge, or Spirit, cannot come to be without first a self-consciousness recognizing another self-consciousness. Such an issue in the history of philosophy had only ever been explored by Johann Gottlieb Fichte and its treatment marks a watershed in European philosophy.\n\nIn order to explain how this works, Hegel uses a story that is in essence an abstracted, idealized history about how two people meet. However, Hegel's idea of the development of self-consciousness from consciousness, and its sublation into a higher unity in absolute knowledge, is not the contoured brain of natural science and evolutionary biology, but a phenomenological construct with a history; one that must have passed through a struggle for freedom before realising itself.\n\nThe abstract language used by Hegel never allows one to interpret this story in a straightforward fashion. It can be read as self-consciousness coming to itself through a child's or adult's development, or self-consciousness coming to be in the beginning of human history (see hominization) or as that of a society or nation realising freedom.\n\nThat the master–slave dialectic can be interpreted as an internal process occurring in one person or as an external process between two or more people is a result, in part, of the fact that Hegel asserts an \"end to the antithesis of subject and object\". What occurs in the human mind also occurs outside of it. The objective and subjective, according to Hegel, sublate one another until they are unified, and the \"story\" takes this process through its various \"moments\" when the lifting up of two contradictory moments results in a higher unity.\n\nFirst, the two abstract consciousnesses meet and are astounded at the realisation of the self as a foreign object. Each can choose to ignore the other, in which case no self-consciousness forms and each views the other merely as an animated object rather than an equivalent subject. Or, they become mesmerized by the mirror-like other and attempt, as they previously had done in controlling their own body, to assert their will.\n\nAccording to Hegel,\n\nWhen initially confronted with another person, the self cannot be immediately recognized :'Appearing thus immediately on the scene, they are for one another like ordinary objects, independent shapes, individuals submerged in the being [or immediacy] of Life'.\n\nA struggle to the death ensues. However, if one of the two should die, the achievement of self-consciousness fails. Hegel refers to this failure as \"abstract negation\" not the negation or sublation required. This death is avoided by the agreement, communication of, or subordination to, slavery. In this struggle the Master emerges as Master because he does not fear death since he does not see his identity dependent on life, while the slave out of this fear consents to the slavery. This experience of fear on the part of the slave is crucial, however, in a later moment of the dialectic, where it becomes the prerequisite experience for the slave's further development.\n\nTruth of oneself as self-conscious is achieved only if both live; the recognition of the other gives each of them the objective truth and self-certainty required for self-consciousness. Thus, the two enter into the relation of master/slave and preserve the recognition of each other.\n\nHowever, this state is not a happy one and does not achieve full self-consciousness. The recognition by the slave is merely on pain of death. The master's self-consciousness is dependent on the slave for recognition and also has a mediated relation with nature: the slave works with nature and begins to shape it into products for the master. As the slave creates more and more products with greater and greater sophistication through his own creativity, he begins to see himself reflected in the products he created, he realises that the world around him was created by his own hands, thus the slave is no longer alienated from his own labour and achieves self-consciousness, while\nthe master on the other hand has become wholly dependent on the products created by his slave; thus the master is enslaved by the labour of his slave.\n\nOne interpretation of this dialectic is that neither a slave nor a master can be considered as fully self-conscious. A person who has already achieved self-consciousness could be enslaved, so self-consciousness must be considered not as an individual achievement, or an achievement of natural and genetic evolution, but as a social phenomenon.\n\nAs philosopher Robert Brandom explains:\n\"Hegel's discussion of the dialectic of the Master and Slave is an attempt to show that asymmetric recognitive relations are metaphysically defective, that the norms they institute aren't the right kind to help us think and act with—to make it possible for us to think and act. Asymmetric recognition in this way is authority without responsibility, on the side of the Master, and responsibility without authority, on the side of the Slave. And Hegel's argument is that unless authority and responsibility are commensurate and reciprocal, no actual normative statuses are instituted. This is one of his most important and certainly one of his deepest ideas, though it's not so easy to see just how the argument works.\"\n\nAlexandre Kojève's unique interpretation differs from this. For Kojève, people are born and history began with the first struggle, which ended with the first masters and slaves. A person is always either master or slave; and there are no real humans where there are no masters and slaves. History comes to an end when the difference between master and slave ends, when the master ceases to be master because there are no more slaves and the slave ceases to be a slave because there are no more masters. A synthesis takes place between master and slave: the integral citizen of the universal and homogenous state created by Napoleon.\n\nThe master and slave relationship influenced numerous discussions and ideas in the 20th century, especially because of its supposed connection to Karl Marx's conception of class struggle as the motive force of social development..\n\nHegel's master–slave dialectic has been influential in the social sciences, philosophy, literary studies, critical theory, postcolonial studies and in psychoanalysis. Furthermore, Hegel's master–slave trope, and particularly the emphasis on recognition, has been of crucial influence on Martin Buber's relational schema in \"I and Thou\", Simone de Beauvoir's account of the history and dynamics of gender relations in \"The Second Sex\" and Frantz Fanon's description of the colonial relation in \"Black Skin, White Masks\". Susan Buck-Morss's article \"Hegel and Haiti\" argues that the Haitian revolution influenced Hegel's writing of his slave-master dialectic.\n\n"}

Ark. 1982), was a 1981 legal case in the US state of Arkansas.\n\nA lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas by various parents, religious groups and organizations, biologists, and others who argued that the Arkansas state law known as the Balanced Treatment for Creation-Science and Evolution-Science Act (Act 590), which mandated the teaching of \"creation science\" in Arkansas public schools, was unconstitutional because it violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\nJudge William Overton handed down a decision on January 5, 1982, giving a clear, specific definition of science as a basis for ruling that creation science is religion and is simply not science. The ruling was not binding on schools outside the Eastern District of Arkansas but had considerable influence on subsequent rulings on the teaching of creationism.\n\nArkansas did not appeal the decision and it was not until the 1987 case of \"Edwards v. Aguillard\", which dealt with a similar law passed by the State of Louisiana, that teaching \"creation science\" was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, making that determination applicable nationwide.\n\nAct 590 had been put forward by a Christian fundamentalist on the basis of a request from the Greater Little Rock Evangelical Fellowship for the introduction of legislation based on a \"model act\" prepared using material from the Institute for Creation Research. It was opposed by many religious organizations and other groups.\n\nThe plaintiffs in the suit, who opposed the \"balanced treatment\" statute, were led by the Reverend William McLean, a United Methodist minister.\n\nThe other plaintiffs were:\n\nThe defendants were the Arkansas Board of Education and its members, in their official capacity, the director of the Department of Education, in his official capacity, and the State Textbooks and Instructional materials Selecting Committee. The Pulaski County Special School District and its directors and superintendent were named in the original complaint but were voluntarily dismissed by plaintiffs at the pre-trial conference on October 1, 1981.\n\nVarious state laws prohibiting teaching of evolution had been introduced in the 1920s. They were challenged in 1968 at \"Epperson v. Arkansas\" which ruled that \"The law's effort was confined to an attempt to blot out a particular theory because of its supposed conflict with the Biblical account, literally read. Plainly, the law is contrary to the mandate of the First, and in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.\" The creationist movement turned to promoting teaching creationism in school science classes as equal to evolutionary theory.\n\nArkansas Act 590 of 1981, entitled the \"Balanced Treatment for Creation Science and Evolution Science Act,\" mandated that \"creation science\" be given equal time in public schools with evolution.\n\nCreation science was defined as follows:\n\"Creation science means the scientific evidences for creation and inferences from those evidences. Creation science includes the scientific evidences and related inferences that indicate:\n\nEvolution science was defined as follows:\n\"Evolution-science\" means the scientific evidences for evolution and inferences from those scientific evidences. Evolution-science includes the scientific evidences and related inferences that indicate:\n\nThe Act was signed into law by Governor Frank D. White on March 19, 1981.\n\nJudge William Overton's ruling handed down on January 5, 1982, concluded that \"creation-science\" as defined in Arkansas Act 590 \"is simply not science\". The judgment defined the essential characteristics of science as being:\n\nOverton found that \"creation science\" failed to meet these essential characteristics for these reasons:\n\nThe creationists' methods do not take data, weigh it against the opposing scientific data, and thereafter reach the conclusions stated in [the Act] Instead, they take the literal wording of the Book of Genesis and attempt to find scientific support for it. The Act took a two-model approach to teaching identical to the approach put forward by the Institute for Creation Research, which assumes only two explanations for the origins of life and existence of man, plants and animals: it was either the work of a creator or it was not. Creationists take this to mean that all scientific evidence which fails to support the theory of evolution is necessarily scientific evidence in support of creationism. The judgment found this to be simply a contrived dualism which has no scientific factual basis or legitimate educational purpose.\n\nThe judge concluded that \"the Act was passed with the specific purpose by the General Assembly of advancing religion,\" and that it violated the First Amendment's Establishment Clause.\n\nThe test that Overton developed on the basis of Michael Ruse's testimony was later criticized by the philosopher of science Larry Laudan who argued that rather than call Creation Science \"non-science\" it would have been more cogent to show that it was \"bad science\". Chandra Wickramasinghe was the single scientist testifying for the defense of creationism. He hypothesized on panspermia and on \"the possibility of high intelligence in the Universe and of many increasing levels of intelligence converging toward a God as an ideal limit.\" \n\n\n"}

To \"carry\" in this context indicates that the firearm is kept readily accessible on the person, within a holster or attached to a sling. \"Carrying\" a firearm directly in the hands, particularly in a firing position or combat stance, is also known as \"brandishing\" and may constitute a serious crime, but that is not the mode of \"carrying\" discussed in this article.\n\nThe practice of open carry, where gun owners openly carry firearms while they go about their daily business, has seen an increase in the U.S. in recent years. This has been marked by a number of organized events intended to increase the visibility of open carry and public awareness about the practice. Proponents of open carry point to history and statistics, noting that criminals usually conceal their weapons, a stark contrast to the law-abiding citizens who display their weapons. Encouraged by groups like The Modern American Revolution, OpenCarry.org, GeorgiaCarry.org and some participants of the Free State Project, open carry has seen a revival in recent years, but it is not yet clear if this represents just a short-term trend.\n\nThe gun rights community has become supportive of the practice. Alan Gottlieb of the Second Amendment Foundation has been cautious in expressing support, while groups such as the aforementioned OpenCarry.org and GeorgiaCarry.org, and certain national groups such as the NRA and Gun Owners of America (GOA) have been more outspoken in favor of the practice.\n\nOpen carry is strongly opposed by gun control groups such as the Brady Campaign and the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.\n\n\nToday in the United States, the laws vary from state to state regarding open carry of firearms. The categories are defined as follows:\n\nIn the United States, the laws concerning open carry vary by state and sometimes by municipality. The following chart lists state policies for openly carrying a loaded handgun in public.\n\nOpen carry has never been authoritatively addressed by the United States Supreme Court. The most obvious predicate for a federal \"right\" to do so would arise under the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. \nIn 2018, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, in \"Young v. Hawaii\", published a decision that the open carry of firearms by Americans is a constitutional right. \nIn the majority opinion in the case of \"District of Columbia v. Heller\" (2008), Justice Antonin Scalia wrote concerning the entirety of the elements of the Second Amendment; \"We find that they guarantee the individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation.\" However, Scalia continued, \"Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited.\"\n\nIt is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.\"\n\nForty five states' constitutions recognize and secure the right to keep and bear arms in some form, and none of those prohibit the open carrying of firearms. Five state constitutions provide that the state legislature may regulate the manner of keeping or bearing arms, and advocates argue that none rule out open carry specifically. Nine states' constitutions indicate that the \"concealed\" carrying of firearms may be regulated and/or prohibited by the state legislature. Open carry advocates argue that, by exclusion, open carrying of arms may \"not\" be legislatively controlled in these states. But this is not settled law.\n\nSection 1.7 of Kentucky's state constitution only empowers the state to enact laws prohibiting \"concealed carry\".\n\nIn 2015, former Florida congressman Allen West opined, regarding the 2015 Supreme Court decision in \"Obergefell v. Hodges\", \"Using the same 'due process clause' argument as the Supreme Court just applied to gay marriage, my concealed carry permit must now be recognized as valid in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\" This opinion echoes reasoning contained in an \"amicus curiae\" brief in \"Obergefell\". Others have indicated support or expressed skepticism for this line of reasoning.\n\n\n\n\n, 45 states allowed open carry, but the details vary widely.\n\nFour states, the Territory of the U.S. Virgin Islands and the District of Columbia fully prohibit the open carry of handguns. On the other extreme, twenty-five states permit open carry of a handgun without requiring the citizen to apply for any permit or license. Fifteen states require some form of permit (often the same permit as allows a person to carry concealed), and the remaining five states, though not prohibiting the practice in general, do not preempt local laws or law enforcement policies, and/or have significant restrictions on the practice, such as prohibiting it within the boundaries of an incorporated urban area. Illinois allows open carry on private property only.\n\nOn October 11, 2011, California Governor Jerry Brown signed into law that it would be a \"misdemeanor to openly carry an exposed and unloaded handgun in public or in a vehicle.\" This does not apply to the open carry of rifles or long guns or persons in rural areas where permitted by ordinance.\n\nOn November 1, 2011, Wisconsin explicitly acknowledged the legality of open carry by amending its disorderly conduct statute (Wis. Stat. 947.01). A new subsection 2 states \"Unless other facts and circumstances that indicate a criminal or malicious intent on the part of the person apply, a person is not in violation of, and may not be charged with a violation of, this section for loading, carrying, or going armed with a firearm, without regard to whether the firearm is loaded or is concealed or openly carried.\"\n\nOn May 15, 2012, Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin signed Senate Bill 1733, an amendment to the Oklahoma Self Defense Act, which will allow people with Oklahoma concealed weapons permits to open carry if they so choose. The law took effect November 1, 2012. \"Under the measure, businesses may continue to prohibit firearms to be carried on their premises.

{"id": "25583465", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25583465", "title": "Outer Temple", "text": "Outer Temple\n\nThe Outer Temple is a building next to the Temple in London, just outside the City of London. It has been suggested that it was once an Inn of Chancery; its historical existence was first posited by A. W. B. Simpson and confirmed by John Baker in 2008. Little is known of it, other than that it lacked a hall; Baker suggests that this is the reason that it did not survive long enough to appear in many records. Other writers have insisted that it was never an inn: Sir George Buck wrote in 1612 \"the Utter Temple neither is nor was ever any college or society of students.\"\n\nIt is believed that the Inns of Chancery evolved in tandem with the Inns of Court. During the 12th and 13th century the law was taught in the City of London, primarily by the clergy. During the 13th century two events happened which destroyed this form of legal education – firstly a papal bull in 1218 that prohibited the clergy from teaching the law, and secondly decrees by King Henry II and Henry III that no institutes of legal education could exist in the City of London As a result, the system of legal education fell apart, and the lawyers instead settled immediately outside the City of London as close as possible to Westminster Hall, where the Magna Carta provided for a permanent court. This was the small village of Holborn, where they inhabited \"hostels\" or \"inns\", which later took their name from the landlord of the Inn in question.\n\nAfter the Temple was confiscated from the Knights Templar in 1312, King Edward II divided it between the Inner Temple and Outer Temple, being the parts of the Temple within and without the boundaries of the City of London. (The Inner Temple was in turn divided in two in 1337, the eastern part continuing to be called Inner Temple and the western part becoming known as Middle Temple. They were each leased to lawyers in 1346.)\n\nWhile John Fortescue wrote of ten Inns of Chancery, each one attached to an Inn of Court \"like Maids of Honour to a Princess\", only nine were well known. The identification of the tenth as Outer Temple was first suggested by A. W. B. Simpson, who discovered a reference to a barrister named William Halle in the year books of the Serjeants-at-Law who was said to have come from the Outer Temple. At the time, Simpson debated whether it was a reference to a historical institution or simply a geographical address. In 2008 John Baker argued that it was most likely an institution with a discovery in the plea rolls of the Court of King's Bench of a barrister who claimed to be a \"fellow of the [Outer] Temple\". In 2013 John Baker discovered another member of the Outer Temple, Richard Palmer, who was sued in the Court of Common Pleas in 1523 and described as of the Exterior or Outer Temple, London.\n\nHowever, this theory overlooks the existence of St George's Inn, a tenth inn of chancery which existed until the late 15th century, when it was abandoned. There is no evidence that Outer Temple was ever anything more than a barristers' chambers.\n\nThere is a 19th-century building called \"The Outer Temple\", situated between Strand and Essex Court/Brick Court (of the Middle Temple), just outside the Middle Temple boundary in the City of Westminster, and directly opposite the Royal Courts of Justice. It is occupied by barristers (as well as a branch of a retail bank) but is not directly related to the historic Outer Temple.\n\nHorace Rumpole, the fictional barrister creation of John Mortimer, QC, claims to have eaten his dinners at the Outer Temple; Mortimer trained at the Inner Temple.\n\n"}

{"id": "1478112", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1478112", "title": "Pet store", "text": "Pet store\n\nA pet store or pet shop is a retail business which sells different kinds of animals to the public. A variety of animal supplies and pet accessories are also sold in pet shops. The products sold include: food, treats, toys, collars, leashes, cat litter, cages and aquariums. Some pet stores provide engraving services for pet tags, which have the owner’s contact information in case the pet gets lost.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, pet shops often offer both hygienic care (such as pet cleaning) and esthetic services (such as cat and dog grooming). Grooming is the process by which a dog or cat's physical appearance is enhanced and kept according to breed standards for competitive breed showing, for other types of competition, like creative grooming or pet tuning contests, or just to their owners taste. Some pet stores also provide tips on training and behaviour, as well as advice on pet nutrition.\n\nThere are many large pet stores located in the US and Canada, including: Petland, Pet Valu, and PetSmart. In the United States, Petco is also a popular pet store. In addition, there are many smaller pet shops that aren't part of big chains, such as Big Al’s and Pet Food Express, which have a smaller number of locations.\n\nPet stores are extremely popular in today’s society. In 2004, according to the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association, in the pet industry, live animal sales reached approximately $1.6 billion. Moreover, in a 2003 survey in the US, merely 38% of U.S. pet shops claimed that they did not sell any live animals.\n\nA major concern with pet stores and the reason why puppies and kittens may not be sold in certain stores anymore is largely due to puppy mills. Puppy mills are commercial dog breeding businesses that breed dogs primarily for profit, often with little regard for animal welfare. According to the Puppy Mill Project \"more than 2.5 million puppies are born in puppy mills each year\" in the United States. Kitten mills are not as widely known as puppy mills, but they still do exist. The animals in these mills are kept in tiny, unsanitary cages, receive little to no nourishment, and often receive no veterinary care. Some cities in Canada, such as Toronto, have altogether banned the sale of cats and dogs in pet stores in order to put an end to this animal abuse.\n\nIn Canada and the US, another area of concern regarding pet stores is the laws that guide pet stores. In the US, there are no federal laws in place that protect animals in retail pet stores. There are state laws to protect animals, however they all vary and some are not sufficient. In twenty states plus D.C., a license is required before being able to manage a pet store. The welfare of animals in pet shops also relies heavily on the veterinary care available to them. In the United States, there are only 16 states that enforce veterinary care laws in pet stores. In Ontario, Canada the Provincial Animal Welfare Act states that the Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has the authorization to examine places where animals are kept for sale, including pet shops.\n\nIn computer science, a \"pet store program\" is an example of how to use a particular software framework or set of libraries to build a real program. Its concept is similar to the Hello world program. It has been made popular by Sun Microsystems for illustrating Java EE, and many other vendors followed.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "351369", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=351369", "title": "Proposed directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions", "text": "Proposed directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions\n\nThe Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions (Commission proposal COM(2002) 92), procedure number 2002/0047 (COD) was a proposal for a European Union (EU) directive aimed to harmonise national patent laws and practices concerning the granting of patents for computer-implemented inventions, provided they meet certain criteria.\n\nThe proposal became a major focus for conflict between those who regarded the proposed directive as a way to codify the case law of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office (unrelated to the EU institutions) in the sphere of computing, and those who asserted that the directive is an extension of the patentability sphere, not just a harmonisation, that ideas are not patentable and that the expression of those ideas is already adequately protected by the law of copyright.\n\nFollowing several years of debate and numerous conflicting amendments to the proposal, the proposal was rejected on 6 July 2005 by the European Parliament by an overwhelming majority of 648 to 14 votes.\n\nOn 20 February 2002, the European Commission initiated a proposal for a directive to codify and \"harmonise\" the different EU national patent laws and cement the practice of the European Patent Office of granting patents for computer-implemented inventions provided they meet certain criteria (cf. software patents under the European Patent Convention). The directive also took on the role of excluding \"business methods\" from patentability (in contrast with the situation under United States law), because business methods as such are not patentable under the different European national patent laws or under the European Patent Convention.\n\nOpponents of the original directive claimed that it was a thinly disguised attempt to make all software patentable. Supporters, however, argued that this was not the case since the proposal explained in several locations (pages 11, 14, 24, 25) that there should be no extension to the existing scope of patentability for computer programs and that pure business methods implemented in software would not be patentable. Only computer programs which provided a \"technical contribution\" would be patentable.\n\nThis reliance on the word \"technical\" was an important weakness in the directive, since it is not a word that has a well-defined meaning, and a \"technical contribution\" was only defined as being \"a contribution to the state of the art in a technical field which is not obvious to a person skilled in the art.\" (See Article 2 of the proposal). Nevertheless, the term has been used as a benchmark for what is and is not patentable by the European Patent Office and by individual national Patent Offices and courts in Europe (particularly the United Kingdom and Germany) since the early 1980s. A general understanding of its meaning can be gleaned from studying the resulting case law, summarised in Software patents under the European Patent Convention. The subsequent failure of the European Parliament to develop an acceptable definition of what was meant by the word technical illustrates the difficulty inherent in attempting to do so.\n\nOn 24 September 2003, the European Parliament passed the directive in a heavily amended form, which placed significant limits on the patentability of software. The most significant changes included:\n\nPatent attorney Axel H. Horns, however, voiced concern that Parliament's wording might extend the ban on software patents to inventions potentially implementable in software, such as signal processing equipment.\n\nPolitically, these amendments were supported almost unanimously by small parties on both the right and left, while the larger groupings (socialists, liberals and conservatives) were all split, with the balance of socialists leaning in favour of amendment and the balance of conservatives leaning against.\n\nParliament's amendments were a major defeat for the directive's original proponents. Rather than confirming the practice of granting patents for computer programs which provide a technical contribution, the revised directive placed substantial limits on patentability.\n\nUnder the codecision procedure, both the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers (representing national Governments) must approve a text in identical terms in order for a proposal to become law. On 18 May 2004, the Council agreed in an advisory vote to resubmit to Parliament what was described as a \"compromise version\" of the proposal. The agreed version permitted patenting of computer-implemented inventions (providing the inventions have a \"technical character\") and overturned most of Parliament's amendments. Critics of the Directive argued that the \"technical character\" requirement was open to too much interpretation and could lead to almost unlimited patentability of software. Proponents, also, felt that the amended version contained too many ambiguities to be capable of meeting the original purpose of the Directive, which was to harmonise the law across Europe. Nevertheless, the Council formally approved this resolution on 7 March 2005. The revised proposal was resubmitted to Parliament.\n\nSubsequently, in an unprecedented move, the Dutch national parliament passed a motion requesting that the nation's ministerial representative on the Council, Laurens Jan Brinkhorst, change his vote on the Council's version of the directive, from \"in favour\" to abstention. Brinkhorst stated that he would not do this. The Council's confirmation (or otherwise) of its President's \"compromise\" had also been delayed.\n\nThe Polish government announced on 16 November 2004, that it could not \"support the text that was agreed upon by Council on 18 May 2004\". A joint press release by the FFII, the Internet Society Poland, and NoSoftwarePatents.com, supported the concerns of opponents of the Council directive, stating:\nat a meeting hosted by the Polish government on the 5th of this month, everyone including representatives of the Polish Patent Office, SUN, Novell, Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft, as well as various patent lawyers, confirmed that the present proposal of the EU Council does make all software potentially patentable. \n\nOn 7 December 2004, the Belgian Minister of Economic Affairs, Marc Verwilghen, stated that no Council decision would be taken until 2005 \"for the reason that the qualified majority does not exist anymore\". However, amid rumours of a change in the Polish position, the 13–15 December meeting of the Council's Committee of Permanent Representatives determined that a qualified majority appeared to exist, and that the Council's revised version of the directive would be scheduled for formal adoption by the Council, without further debate, probably at the Agricultures and Fisheries Council meeting on the 21 and 22 December 2004.\n\nStatements expressing reservations were attached to this Common Position by Belgium (which abstained), France (which hoped for further changes to the directive), the Netherlands (where the parliament requested their representative vote against), Poland (which was opposed until recent diplomatic pressure), Hungary and Latvia. Germany was ambivalent, saying that the text of the directive could benefit from improvements.\n\nDue to the expressed reservations and especially to opposition from Poland, whose Minister of Science and Information Technology made a special journey to Brussels to demand that the directive be dropped from the agenda, the Council's vote was postponed \"indefinitely\".\n\nMeanwhile, a group of 61 MEPs from 13 countries tabled a \"motion for a resolution\" to restart the entire legislative process. On 2 February 2005, JURI, the Legal Affairs Committee of the European Parliament, voted 19–1 in favour of asking the Commission to withdraw the directive and restart the process.\n\nThe next day, Nicolas Schmit, deputy foreign minister of Luxembourg (which at that time chaired the Council), said that he would instead ask the Council to formally adopt the draft directive at a meeting on 17 February. Although Poland stated it would only oppose this if other countries raised an objection, reports of opposition from Denmark, the Netherlands and Spain ensured that the common position was not on the agenda for that meeting of the Commission.\n\nOn 17 February, Parliament's Conference of Presidents (the President of the Parliament and the leaders of the political groups) approved JURI's request to restart the process, and agreed to pass the request to the European Commission. On 24 February, a plenary session of the European Parliament reinforced this message, inviting the Commission to reconsider, but on 28 February the Commission refused the parliament's request.\n\nThe \"common position\" reappeared on the agenda of the Council's 7 March meeting as an \"A-item\" for adoption without discussion. At the Competitiveness meeting of the Council, Denmark requested that this be removed. The President of the Council, seemingly in breach of the Council's procedures, opposed this, \"for administrative reasons\" and because it would defeat the logic of the directive. The Danish representative accepted this at face value, declined to object formally, and entered Denmark's objections into the record. The common position was thus adopted without debate, and referred to the European Parliament for a second reading, with dissenting statements and caveats from a number of countries. In the event, only Spain had actually voted against: Austria, Belgium and Italy abstained (which has the same effect as voting against, given the way Qualified Majority Voting works).\n\nIn June 2005, the legal affairs committee of the European Parliament discussed the directive and rejected plans for a complete overhaul of the directive. The vote by the committee took place on 21 June 2005, and narrowly decided not to substantially amend the Council version of the directive. According to the \"Financial Times\", this \"vote marks a turning point in the protracted battle over the law, which has split the software industry and sparked severe recriminations.\"\nOn 5 July 2005, the committee's report passed to a plenary session of Parliament for debate by all MEPs. On 6 July 2005, Parliament rejected the proposal by a very large majority (648 in favour of rejection, 14 against and 18 registered abstentions out of 729 total MEPS) without considering any of the other 175 proposed amendments. Under the codecision procedure, the legislative process ended with this rejection and the proposed directive did not become law in any form. This was the first and the only time a directive was ever rejected by Parliament at second reading.\n\nThe vote was the result of a compromise between the different parties: those in favour of software patents feared a text that would heavily limit its scope, while those against rejected the whole principle. Heavy defeat was the \"least worst option\" to both sides. In addition, some saw the defeat as an expression of Parliament's indignation about the handling of the proposal by the Council of the European Union and the European Commission as well as its concerns about the content of the proposal itself.\n\nParliament's decision to strike down the final draft has the effect that national laws will not be harmonised. National legislatures may continue to enact laws allowing patents on computer-implemented inventions, should they wish to do so, and national courts may enforce such laws. The European Patent Office, which is not legally bound by any EU directive but generally adapts its regulations to new EU law, has no reason or incentive to adapt its practice of granting patents on computer-implemented inventions under certain conditions, according to its interpretation of the European Patent Convention and its Implementing Regulations.\n\nSupporters of the proposed directive included Microsoft, IBM, Hewlett-Packard and the European Patent Office.\n\nThe European Information and Communication Technology Association (EICTA) stated that the directive \"is extremely important for the future of innovation in Europe as it concerns two-thirds of all inventions in the European hi-tech industry\". This position was characterised by opponents of software patents as \"dominated by patent lawyers from the patent arms of large corporate members\", \"most of which qualifying as non-European companies\" and \"with a patent policy (...) tailored to the special interests of a few large corporations (...)\". After the heavily modified draft directive was finally rejected, EICTA's Director General said, \"This is a wise decision that has helped industry to avoid legislation that could have narrowed the scope of patent legislation in Europe. ... Parliament has today voted for the status quo, which preserves the current system that has served well the interests of our 10,000 member companies, both large and small.\"\n\nThe proposal provoked public disagreement by diverse opponents of software patents, who argued that software patents were neither economically desirable nor mandated by international law. The FFII and the EuroLinux Alliance played key roles in co-ordinating this campaign, which drew support from some free software and open source programmers, some academics, some small business groups, and some proprietary software developers. Many of these organisations expressed concern over what they saw as abuses of the software patent system in the USA, and argued that although some software patents might be beneficial, the net effect of the Commission's proposals would be to suppress innovation and dampen legitimate competition. The opponent's campaign in its turn was characterised by supporters of the directive as \"a small but highly organised and vocal lobby\", with EICTA stating that \"Those who depict the draft directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions as some sort of 'software patent law' are at best misinformed and at worst dishonest, malicious and disrespectful of the European democratic process\".\n\nFigures who have supported the campaign against software patents in Europe include Tim Berners-Lee, developer of the World Wide Web; Florian Müller, a free software lobbyist; and Linus Torvalds, creator of the Linux kernel. Politicians opposed to the directive included Michel Rocard.\n\nAs the directive was rejected, pre-existing law has remained in place, and computer-implemented inventions are currently governed by Article 52 of European Patent Convention. Article 52 prohibits certain patents, including patents on \"programs for computers\", but only \"as such\". It is often interpreted by European Patent Office as well as by courts in EU countries, that invention should have \"technical character\". For example, while a mathematical method is not patentable, an electrical filter designed according to this method would not usually be excluded from patentability by Article 52(2) and (3).\n\nFinal interpretation of the law in this area thus continues to be the responsibility of national courts, following national case-law (except when a European patent application is refused or when a European patent is revoked in opposition proceedings before the EPO, in which case the EPO has the final say regarding the interpretation of the EPC).\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12354893", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12354893", "title": "Public Service of Canada", "text": "Public Service of Canada\n\nThe Public Service of Canada (known as the Civil Service of Canada prior to 1967) is the civil service of the Government of Canada. Its function is to serve as the staff of the Canadian Crown. The Clerk of the Privy Council, as Canada's senior serving civil servant, is head of the Public Service of Canada.\n\nThe Public Service is divided into various subsidiary administrative units such as departments, agencies, commissions, Crown corporations, and other federal organizations. Over 40% of the Public Service of Canada is located in the National Capital Region, although there are employees working at approximately 1,600 locations across Canada. The Public Service of Canada is the country's single largest employer.\n\nThe purpose of the Public Service of Canada, as the non-political staff of the \"executive branch\" of government, is the day to day administration of the state and to the effective implementation of government policy and regulation in accordance with Canadian law. The civil service is responsible to the Crown (state) itself and not the ruling government or political party,\n\nIn addition to the fundamental role of carrying out decisions taken by the ruling government, the public service also has a planning role, and may develop proposals and recommendations to Cabinet. It will also provide continued feedback and advice to government in all aspects of governmental affairs.\n\nIn 2007, there were approximately 200 departments (e.g., Health Canada), agencies (e.g., Parks Canada), commissions (e.g., Canadian Grain Commission), boards (e.g., Veterans Review and Appeal Board), councils (e.g., Canadian Judicial Council) and crown corporations (e.g., Royal Canadian Mint).\n\nIn a typical department, it is the minister who holds the respective portfolio who has overall responsibility for the management and direction of the department (i.e. the Minister of National Defence holds the Defence Portfolio, which includes many different organisations, one of which being the Department of National Defence). The deputy minister is the head of the department and is its senior serving civil servant, and therefore has responsibility for all of the department's day-to-day operations. However, it is always the respective minister who is held accountable to parliament for its operations.\n\nA variety of associate and assistant deputy ministers head the various sections of responsibility within a department (i.e. policy, finance and corporate services, environment and infrastructure, etc.). Within the jurisdiction of each Assistant Deputy Minister, is usually one to two Associate Deputy Ministers and beneath them two to five Directors-General who oversee more functional areas of each broad element of the department. Under Directors-General are Directors, who oversee various directorates, which are the core of any department. These directorates constitute the ground level in each department, and are the members of the civil service who implement state decisions, carry out research, and help to formulate proposals.\n\nHiring (or selection) of civil service employees is typically done through a selection process that is either open to employees of the Public Service only (internal) or open to the general public (external). External processes are typically done to recruit a greater number of applicants. Conversely, internal processes may be held for positions where there is considered to be an adequate internal candidates and/or to provide opportunities for advancement within the civil service.\n\nThe area of selection varies greatly depending on whether it is conducted as an internal or external process. The latter are open to Canadian citizens nationally, and sometimes internationally.\n\nSince the 2005 coming into force of the 2003 Public Service Modernization Act, selection processes focus less on a rules-based concept of \"best-qualified\", and more on a values-based approach that enables managers to hire qualified and competent individuals whose experience, skills and knowledge are the right fit given the position's current and future needs.\n\nFederal civil service employees in Canada are employed by the state, but because of Canada's history and formal structure as a monarchy, they are often described as being employed by the Crown, who personifies the state and \"enjoys a general capacity to contract in accordance with the rule of ordinary law.\" Since the Public Service Modernization Act came into force in 2003, individuals had to take an Oath of Allegiance before they could assume their post. However, as of December 31, 2005, this is no longer a requirement, with civil servants taking an Oath of Office instead. \n\nHiring in the core public administration is governed by the Public Service Employment Act, while other organizations hire independently.\n\nAs of September, 2006, there were approximately 260,000 employees within the civil service, divided as follows:\n\nAdditionally, although not part of the Public Service of Canada, the following 194,000 members were employed by the federal government:\n\n\nThere are approximately 80 distinct job classifications in the core civil service; most work in policy, operations or administrative functions. About 15% are scientists and professionals, 10% work in technical operations and 2.5% are executives.\n\nAbout 42% of Canadian civil servants work in the National Capital Region (NCR) (Ottawa-Hull), 24% work elsewhere in Ontario or Quebec, 21% in Western Canada, and 11% in Atlantic Canada. Since the headquarters of most agencies are located in the NCR, about 72% of executives work in this area.\n\nCanadian civil servants are also located in more than 180 countries (in the form of foreign service officers) and provide service in 1,600 locations in Canada.\n\nApproximately 80% of federal civil service employees are represented by a bargaining agent (union). The greatest number of civil servants are members of the Public Service Alliance of Canada. They negotiate a collective bargaining agreement for blue collar workers, and most administrative staff.\n\nThe Canadian Public Service has made significant efforts to reflect the gender balance, linguistic, and ethnic diversity in Canada.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Gowan is a March 1998 case tried by the Ontario Court of Justice which ruled that, while being topless as form of protest and free speech is legal, being topless while one engages in a commercial purpose such as prostitution is illegal.\n\nOn June 3, 1997, 31-year-old prostitute J. Gowan took her shirt off and bared her breasts on Montreal Road in the Ontario city of Vanier. Afterwards, Gowan held her breasts, pulled her nipples, and asked nearby car drivers several times if they \"want to fuck\" her. On two occasions, Gowan did this while she was leaning into other people's cars during a red light. Considering Gowan's behavior—rather than her toplessness itself—to be indecent, Cecile Couture reported Gowan to the authorities.\n\nIn her ruling, Judge Jennifer Blishen stated that the evidence indicates that the purpose of Gowan's toplessness and provocative behavior was to engage in prostitution and that thus, unlike the actions of Ontario woman Gwen Jacob several years earlier, Gowan's toplessness was commercial in nature. In addition, Blishen stated that she \"cannot find that the community would tolerate the use of a woman's bare breasts in public in order to sell any form of service or product\" since \"[s]uch conduct would appear to promote the objectification of women and the accompanying social harm.\" Elaborating on this, Blishen wrote that Gowan's actions \"portray women in a humiliating manner as sex objects, with the resulting loss of dignity.\" Thus, Blishen found that Gowan's actions constituted an indecent act in a public place contrary to section 173(1)(a) of the Criminal Code\" and that thus Gowan is \"guilty as charged.\" As a result of her conviction for indecent behavior, Gowan was fined $250.\n\nIn her 2009 book \"Law's Dream of a Common Knowledge\", Mariana Valverde criticized this ruling by arguing that it ensured that \"the women who have the best 'lawful excuse,' as law puts it, to go around topless are expressly forbidden from doing so.\" Elaborating on this, Valverde states that a \"new line has been drawn, between the speaking, rational, political woman, who can now bare her breasts even in the presence of unsuspecting children, and the whore of old, who must be covered while outdoors.\"\n"}

Overtime is required to qualify for retroactive overtime. So, if a salesperson receives a commission, but does not receive overtime, then the employee does not qualify for retroactive overtime.\n\nRetroactive overtime is computed by using the number of hours of overtime worked for the specified payroll period to look up the coefficient percentages from the coefficient table (Form WH-134). This coefficient percentage is then multiplied by the commission and/or bonus to determine the ROT amount that will be awarded to the employee in addition to the already existing overtime and commission.\n\nThe additional amount on money beyond the overtime, the commission or bonus, must be a guaranteed payment to the employee based upon specified work criteria. Here are some examples of some bonuses that qualify and do not qualify.\n\nIf an employee is awarded a known amount of money for working a certain shift or for working a number of consecutive weeks, that additional amount of money that is paid beyond the regular base pay and overtime will qualify for retroactive overtime if and only if there are also overtime hours paid during the same pay period of the qualifying bonus. You could also consider this to have an OT value of zero and add an additional look-up table value of all zeros for the percentages to use to determine the ROT amount.\n\nIf an employee is awarded a discretionary bonus that is not guaranteed based upon specific work criteria, this bonus does not qualify for retroactive overtime. A good example of this is a Christmas bonus that may be awarded to employees. This is not a guaranteed bonus that the employee will receive for meeting a specified goal but is rather a bonus that is awarded to the employee on the discretion of the company.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6606609", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6606609", "title": "Rule in Dearle v Hall", "text": "Rule in Dearle v Hall\n\nThe rule in \"Dearle v Hall\" (1828) 3 Russ 1 is an English common law rule to determine priority between competing equitable claims to the same asset. The rule broadly provides that where the equitable owner of an asset purports to dispose of his equitable interest on two or more occasions, and the equities are equal between claimants, the claimant who first notifies the trustee or legal owner of the asset shall have a first priority claim.\n\nAlthough the original decisions related to interests under a trust, most modern applications of the rule relate to the factoring of receivables or multiple grants of equitable security interests.\n\nThe rule has been subject to some scathing criticism, and has been abrogated in a number of common law countries in the Commonwealth.\n\nThe rule in \"Dearle v Hall\" has been controversial almost since its inception. In 1893, Lord Macnaghten said \"I am inclined to think that the rule in \"Dearle v Hall\" has on the whole produced at least as much injustice as it has prevented.\" But this has not stopped it from being extended from a rule regulating the priority of interests in trusts to the regulation of the priority of proprietary interests in debts and other similar intangibles, such as rights under contracts, which is considerably more important in terms of modern commerce.\n\nThe actual decision in \"Dearle v Hall\", on its facts, is relatively uncontroversial. The beneficial owner of a trust fund assigned it first by way of security to A, and then outright to B, in each case for valuable consideration. A had not given notice of his assignment to the trustees of the fund and, accordingly, when B made enquiries of them, he did not discover the existence of the assignment to A because the trustees were not aware of it. B did give notice of the assignment to the trustees, and then A subsequently also gave notice to them. Plumer MR and, on appeal, Lord Lyndhurst LC each decided that B took priority over A.\n\nJudgment was given in favour of B for two reasons. The first was based on the general proposition, that, as between two equitable interests, the first in time will only take priority \"if the equities are equal\". In this case, by failing to give notice to the trustees, A had allowed the beneficiary of the trust to be able to hold himself out as being the unencumbered owner of the beneficial interest and had therefore enabled the beneficiary to hoodwink B into thinking he had not encumbered it. This is a perfectly straightforward application of the principle that the first in time will only prevail if the equities are equal and is not considered controversial.\n\nThe second ground for the decision was that A's failure to give notice had left the beneficiary of the trust in apparent possession of the trust fund, and A could not, therefore, rely on this assignment in a dispute with B. This latter ground has been criticised as it appears to be based on the concept of reputed ownership in bankruptcy law, which had never previously been employed in determining priority between competing equitable claims. Nevertheless, on the facts of the case most commentators feel that justice was done; A had allowed the beneficiary to commit a fraud on B, and therefore A should rank behind B.\n\nHowever, it was in subsequent developments that the rule was turned from an example of the principle that the first in time rule will not apply if the equities are not equal into an absolute rule that the first to give notice will take priority unless the later assignee was a volunteer or was aware of the earlier assignment at the time he obtained his assignment. The rule applies even if the later assignee made no enquiries of the trustees and even if the first assignee was not negligent in failing to give notice, for instance because he was not aware of it or because there was no one to whom notice could be given. In \"Ward v Duncombe\" [1893] AC 369, the House of Lords decided that the rule that notice determines priority of dealings applied regardless of the conduct of the competing assignees.\n\nIn spite of the criticisms of the way in which the rule in \"Dearle v Hall\" has developed, there is much to be said for the concept that the priority of assignments or charges over debts should, as a general rule, depend on the date notice is given to the person who owes the debt. Not least, this is because the person who owes the debt will get a good discharge by paying the creditor unless he has been notified of the assignment or charge. Once a debt has been paid, it ceases to exist, and the priority rule recognises this fact. That is not to say that, in appropriate cases, it would not be possible for one creditor to trace the proceeds of the debt into the hands of another. But a simple rule that both priority and discharge depend on notice has much to recommend it.\n\nMost of the academic criticism of the rule is to the effect that it has been carried too far. Whilst it is generally accepted for a subsequent assignee for value to take priority over an earlier assignee by giving notice before he becomes aware of the earlier assignment, it seems harsh for the earlier assignee to lose priority where the notice is given by the subsequent assignee after he is aware of the earlier assignment. The net result is the priority depends upon the subsequent speed of response of the parties once one or both of them becomes aware of the problem.\n\nThe Law Commission of England and Wales, as part of a wider view of priority rules relating to security interests has recommended the abolition of the rule in \"Dearle v Hall\" in relation to security interests and assignments of receivables only, and its replacement with a system of registration. To date, such recommendations have not been implemented.\n"}
{"id": "648563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=648563", "title": "START II", "text": "START II\n\nSTART II (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) was a bilateral treaty between the United States of America and Russia on the Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms. It was signed by United States President George H. W. Bush and Russian President Boris Yeltsin on 3 January 1993, banning the use of multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs) on intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). Hence, it is often cited as the De-MIRV-ing Agreement. It never entered into effect. It was ratified by the U.S. Senate on 26 January 1996 with a vote of 87-4. Russia ratified START II on 14 April 2000, but on 14 June 2002, withdrew from the treaty in response to U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty.\n\nInstead, SORT came into effect, reducing strategic warheads count per country to 1,700 - 2,200.\n\nMIRVed land-based ICBMs are considered destabilizing because they tend to put a premium on striking first. A MIRVed missile is able to carry 3-12 warheads and deliver them to separate targets. Thereby, if it is used in a first strike, it possibly destroys many of the enemy's missile sites.\n\nHypothetically, if one were to assume that each side had 100 missiles, with 5 warheads each, and further that each side had a 95 percent chance of neutralizing the opponent's missiles in their silos by firing 2 warheads at each silo, then the side that strikes first can reduce the enemy ICBM force from 100 missiles to about 5 by firing 40 missiles with 200 warheads and keeping the remaining 60 missiles in reserve. Thus the destruction capability is greatly multiplied by MIRV, when the number of enemy silos does not significantly increase.\n\nBoth Soviet R-36M and the US LGM-118 Peacekeeper missiles were capable of carrying up to 10 MIRVs (the latter not currently operational).\n\nThe historic agreement started on 17 June 1992 with the signing of a 'Joint Understanding' by the presidents. The official signing of the treaty by the presidents took place on 3 January 1993. It was ratified by the U.S. Senate on 26 January 1996 with a vote of 87-4. However, Russian ratification was stalled in the Duma for many years. It was postponed a number of times to protest American military actions in Kosovo, as well as to oppose the expansion of NATO.\n\nAs the years passed, the treaty became less relevant and both sides started to lose interest in it. For the Americans, the main issue became the ABM Treaty, which forbade the deployment of a nationwide missile defense system. The United States withdrew from the ABM Treaty in June 2002, a move which Russia fiercely opposed.\n\nSTART II did not enter into force. On 14 April 2000 the Duma did finally ratify the treaty, in a largely symbolic move since the ratification was made contingent on preserving the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM Treaty) and thereby preserving the long-standing principle of mutually assured destruction (MAD). To be specific, Russian ratification was made contingent on the U.S. Senate ratifying a September 1997 addendum to START II which included agreed statements on demarcation of strategic versus tactical missile defences. Neither of these occurred because of U.S. Senate opposition, where a faction objected to any action supportive of the existing ABM Treaty.\n\nHowever, in 2001, President George W. Bush set a plan in motion to reduce the country’s missile forces from 6,000 to between 1,700 and 2,200.\n\nThus the START II treaty was officially bypassed by the SORT treaty, agreed to by Presidents George W. Bush and Vladimir Putin at their summit meeting in November 2001, and signed at Moscow Summit on 24 May 2002. Both sides agreed to reduce operationally deployed strategic nuclear warheads to 1,700 from 2,200 by 2012.\n\nOn 13 June 2002, the U.S. withdrew from the ABM Treaty, and on the following day Russia announced that it would no longer consider itself to be bound by START II provisions. Both countries continued to pursue their objectives: Russia to this day retains 54 MIRV-capable RS-20/R-36M (SS-18 Satan) with 10 warheads each, 40 MIRV-capable RS-18/UR-100N (SS-19 Stiletto) with 6 warheads each and 24 MIRV-capable RS-24 Yars with 3 warheads each. The United States developed Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system to protect from small-scale ICBM attack.\n\nIn October 2002 United States began unilateral withdrawal of MIRV (including complete deactivation of Peacekeeper missiles) and completed it by 19 September 2005. The Minuteman III is, as of 2011, the only United States land-based operational ICBM. It can potentially carry up to only 3 RVs.\n\n\n"}

Handy\", 164 CCC (3d) 481, 2 SCR 908 (2002):\n\nEvidence of prior bad acts by the accused will be admissible if the prosecution satisfies the judge on a balance of probabilities that, in the context of the particular case, the probative value of the evidence in relation to a specific issue outweighs its potential prejudice and thereby justifies its reception.\n\nQuestions arise as to how the Court will measure the elements of this rule:\n\ni) What constitutes a prior act of misconduct? \n\nii) Why does the Court speak of evidence in relation to a 'specific issue'? \n\niii) How is probative value determined? \n\nThe 2001 trial of Roy Whiting may have influenced the decision to change the law in England and Wales (R v Handy continues to govern the law in Canada). These changes were brought into force by the 'Bad Character' provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (sections 98 to 113).\nAlthough preceding these changes, Rosemary West's 1995 trial has also been cited as an example where similar fact evidence was crucial to the prosecution case.\n\nSimilar fact evidence can be used even if the original \"misconduct\" could not be prosecuted due to duress or the offender's youth. In a case of a Devon family imprisoned in 1998, one of the defendants appealed his conviction for raping his sister at the age of 16, suggesting it was unlikely that she would not complain or seek help. It was held that the evidence that his father had coerced him into sexual acts with his other sisters as a child was similar fact evidence and, in addition to the systematic long-term sexual activity and abuse within the family, sufficient to explain why he felt that he could get away with abusing her and knew she could not rely on her family for protection; his appeal failed.

James' family had emigrated from Fife, Scotland, to Canada in 1831, and James from St. Armand, Quebec, to the U.S. in 1847.\n\nIn New York, James opened an ice cream shop called \"James Smith and Son.\" James Smith bought a cough drop recipe from a journeyman peddler named Sly Hawkins and in 1852 made his first batch of \"Smith Brothers Cough Drops\".\n\nWilliam and Andrew took over the business after their father died in 1866.\n\nOriginally the drops were sold from glass jars on countertops. To prevent drug stores from selling generic versions the company began packaging drops in branded boxes in 1872. To distinguish their drops from imitators, the bearded brothers created a logo featuring their portraits and stamped it on their boxes. When trademarked in 1877 the word \"Trade\" appeared under the picture of William and the word \"Mark\" under Andrew's. It followed the brothers became known as Trade and Mark, nicknames that stick to this day.\n\nOf the brothers, William Smith was the dominant, community-minded and a prohibitionist. He was known for such quirks as keeping financial records on the backs of used envelopes. He ran for public office several times and was a generous local philanthropist who assessed his brother Andrew for half of all charitable donations whether he knew of them or not.\n\nAndrew, on the other hand, was known as the more amiable brother and not a tee-totaller.\n\nThe company's staunch defense of its trademark made the Smiths' faces among the most famous in America, the subject of editorials, comics, and cultural references.\n\nAndrew Smith died in 1895, and William continued as company president until he died in 1913. William was succeeded by his son, Arthur G. Smith (c1875-1936), who expanded the company by adding menthol drops in 1922, cough syrup in 1926, and wild cherry drops in 1948. Arthur G. Smith had two sons: William Wallace Smith II (1888–1955) and Robert Lansing Smith (1891–1962). William Wallace Smith II was born in Poughkeepsie N.Y.\n\nIn 1963 the brand was purchased by Warner-Lambert.\n\nIt was bought by F & F Foods of Chicago, Illinois, in 1972 and production left Poughkeepsie. The iconic Smith Brothers logo was diminished in favor of the F&F Foods logo and the brothers' name recognition declined, though they would continue to make appearances in pop culture references such as the season 1, 1986 of \"Golden Girls\" episode, \"The Flu” Rose politely declines a Sucrets cough drop from her date, and tells him that she’s “sucking on a Smith Brothers” And later on the 2009 \"Simpsons\" episode, \"O Brother, Where Bart Thou?\" The expression, \"When the Smith Brothers shave...\" was used in popular culture to mean something that was never expected to happen. In the 1906 Victor Herbert operetta \"The Red Mill\", two heavily bearded men appear on stage, while one of the Vaudevillians yells, \"Pipe, the Smith Brothers!\"\n\nIn 2011, the brand was sold to GemCap, a private equity fund in Santa Monica, California.\n\nIn 2014 the brand was purchased by hedge fund York Capital Management, who once again attempted to revive the brand which had largely disappeared from store shelves. However, in 2016, the Smith brothers cough drop brand folded due to declining sales. However, Smith Brothers cough drops remained available on retail shelves and online due to unexpired back stock.\n\nIn May 2016, the Smith Brothers brand was acquired by Lanes Brands in Bedford, New Hampshire, the United States subsidiary of Lanes Health in Gloucester, United Kingdom. According to the Lane Brands website, the Smith Brothers brand of cough drops will be back in the American and worldwide markets later in 2017.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "23810295", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23810295", "title": "The Broken Compass", "text": "The Broken Compass\n\nThe Broken Compass: How British Politics Lost its Way is the fourth book by British writer Peter Hitchens, published in May 2009. Polemical and partly autobiographical, the book contends that the British political right and left no longer hold firm, adversarial beliefs, but vie for position in the centre, while at the same time overseeing a general decline in British society.\n\nHitchens depicts the right in particular as a confused and spent political force that has been subsumed by the centre-left, itself a product of Fabian social democracy. As a result of these factors, \"there is no longer any debate between the political parties about issues that have divided thinkers down the ages, and divide the population even now\". Hitchens concludes that, since the compass is broken, the time has come in British politics for the re-establishment of a proper adversarial system and for principles to be rediscovered.\n\nIn the media, \"The Broken Compass\" received mostly negative reviews from left-leaning newspapers, and was largely ignored by the conservative press. It was reissued as The Cameron Delusion in March 2010, two months before David Cameron became the British Prime Minister.\n\nHitchens sets out his stall in the preface \"The Lost Frontier\", stating: \"conventional wisdom is almost always wrong. By the time it has become conventional, it has ceased to be wisdom and become cant. Its smug cousin, received opinion, is just as bad. The aim of this book is to defy these two enemies of thought and reason\", and \"conventional wisdom's biggest single mistake is its thought-free, obsolete idea of Left and Right\". In a column written before the book's publication, Hitchens also explored themes contained in \"The Broken Compass\", and wrote \"The cold, miserable truth is that both our major political parties are corpses, their original purposes long forgotten, their loyal members driven away or sidelined, and their traditional voters taken for granted\".\n\nIn Chapter 1, \"Guy Fawkes Gets a Blackberry\", Hitchens claims that opinion polls are a device for influencing public opinion and not measuring it, and that political parties and newspapers are responsible for this manipulation, whose purpose is to \"bring about the thing it claims is already happening\". The author cites contemporary examples of the media attacking Gordon Brown and the expected win of the Conservative Party at the 2010 general election. Hitchens begins Chapter 2, \"The Power of Lunch\", by asserting, based on his time as a reporter at Westminster, that political journalists are uninterested in serious political debate; propagate received centre-left standpoints on issues; and consult with each other and politicians about media stories. Chapter 3, \"Time for a Change\", describes how a media reporting bias is attempting to facilitate a Tory general election win. Hitchens states one of his motivations in writing the book was to frustrate this exercise. Hitchens claims in Chapter 4, \"Fear of Finding Something Worse\", that Labour has reached \"the most significant moment in its history – the complete acceptance of its programme by the Conservatives\". The author invokes the closing image of George Orwell's \"Animal Farm\" to illustrate how close the two parties have become. Chapter 5, \"The Great Landslide\", discusses how a number of left-wing writers and newspapers have begun describing the Conservatives in favourable terms, and how this no longer constituted \"a form of treason\".\n\nChapter 6, \"Riding the Prague Tram\", describes Hitchens's experience of travelling in Communist Bloc countries before the fall of the Soviet Union and how this, combined with the behaviour of certain left-wing organisations in the UK, led to his becoming disillusioned with the British Left. He also carries out a lengthy critique of the Western Left's apologist stance towards Soviet Communism, including views held by Fabian Society members Beatrice and Maurice Webb; the attempt to exonerate and romanticise Lenin and Trotsky; and intellectual resistance to the works of Alexander Solzhenitsyn and Robert Conquest. In Chapter 7, \"A Fire Burning Under Water\", Hitchens describes the final stage in his becoming disenchanted with the British Left – the British Trades Union Congress's (TUC) failure to support the Gdańsk shipyard workers challenging their communist government.\n\nChapter 8, \"Racism, Sexism and Homophobia\", examines how the modern ideology of race and the term racist differ from the previous concept of \"racialism\", and how the sexual revolution represents \"seeking the existing order's permission to pursue pleasure at all costs\", which undermines Christian principles of marriage, and has its roots in events in 1968. In Chapter 9, \"Sexism is Rational\", Hitchens states that the Left's taking up feminist causes since the 1960s has led to the damage and exploitation of women, as well as a decline in marriage. Hitchens says this process is part of revolutionaries' seeking to \"destroy and expunge the restraints placed on human selfishness by the Christian religion. The permanent married family is the greatest single obstacle to this\". Hitchens concludes that in Britain there is an emerging citizenry \"prepared for enslavement, ignorant of its origins, past, rights, traditions, and duties\" and that \"only in a wholly broken political system could there be such a need for reform, and no reformers ready to address it\".\n\nIn Chapter 10, \"Equality or Tolerance\", Hitchens examines how the Left have since the 1960s taken up the cause of equal rights for homosexuals. Hitchens says supporters of Leo Abse's 1967 law reform on homosexuality are now accused of intolerance if they do not support homosexual civil partnerships or discrimination on the grounds of homosexuality. Hitchens concludes by stating, \"the atrophy of religion and patriotism in the Labour party, like the atrophy of the same things in the Tory Party, is the deep problem beneath all others\".\nChapter 11, \"The Fall of the Meritocracy\", examines falling standards in British education. Hitchens cites the abolition of grammar schools as one of the main causes, which has also resulted in a decline in social mobility. Hitchens claims egalitarians deny these consequences and that comprehensive education has failed. Hitchens also quotes a 2000 study, which asserted that \"the general lowering of standards and rigour since the end of selection is one of the main reasons behind the current drive to devalue examinations\". Hitchens asks why, \"the educated, conscious servants of the state should seek to pretend that educational standards are rising when the opposite is true. The answer is that they have put equality before education\". Chapter 12, \"'The age of the train'\", outlines how the Conservative and Labour parties facilitated the dismantling of much of Britain's rail network. Hitchens asserts this is evidence that the \"Tory Party does not love Britain, any more than the Labour Party loves the poor\". The chapter also provides a conservative argument against mass car ownership, saying that \"roads destroy and distort established ways of living\", while \"the traditional English town, with its defined centre, ancient street pattern and comfortable shape, was not destroyed by the coming of the railway. It was enhanced\". In Chapter 13, \"A Comfortable Hotel on the Road to Damascus\", Hitchens explores how since the 2001 September 11 attacks and the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, certain commentators on the left realigned with an American neoconservative position, which, \"delivers him [the leftist commentator] to another portion of the 'centre ground', one where foreign policy is the only thing worth discussing, and where former conservatives and former Leftists can mingle in happy communion\", and allows \"political conservatism to soothe its tribal base by appearing strong overseas, while failing to be anything of the kind at home\".\n\nHitchens asserts that political mismanagement, facilitated by an abandonment of the adversarial system, has resulted in an overall decline in British society. He identifies the end of the Cold War (which \"made many of the old political positions meaningless overnight\") as one cause of this, as well as the implementation of the ideas of Fabian social democracy and the ideology of the 1960s.\n\nOn publication the book was reviewed in \"The Guardian\", \"The Observer\" and the \"New Statesman\", was the occasion of two interviews with Hitchens with Hannah Pool in \"The Guardian\", and a discussion with the author on BBC Radio 4.\n\nThe reviews in the left-wing press were generally unfavourable; Peter Wilby's review in \"The Observer\" was dismissive towards much of the book's contents. Wilby wrote \"As Hitchens sees it, 'the broken compass' is chiefly the Conservatives' fault. Even under Thatcher, they accepted too many of Labour's social democratic and liberal reforms. So we have a permanent government of the centre and one of Labour's main aims is to stop a genuinely Conservative party emerging that may attract working-class votes on such issues as \"immigration and disorder\" and getting Britain out of Europe. 'It was greatly in Labour's interest, once the Tory party had accepted so much of Labour's programme as unalterable, that the Tory party should be preserved against the danger of dissolution,' Hitchens writes. There is a grain of truth in all this, but on the left most would reverse the argument. The postwar consensus was destroyed in the Thatcher years and Labour failed to restore it, accepting, at least until the credit crunch, unrestrained neoliberal capitalism. New Labour's appeal to business and the City was that it closed off, perhaps forever, the possibility of a genuinely socialist alternative\".\n\nWriting in the \"New Statesman\", Anthony Howard saw the book as \"a hotchpotch of separate essays\" and that, though Hitchens mounts a spirited defence of his beliefs, he nevertheless resembles \"some faintly out-of-date figure searching the kitchen for any pot or pan he can hurl against the spirit of the age\".\nIn a review in \"The Guardian\", Steven Poole described Hitchens as being \"in general exhilaratingly good when attacking the hypocrisies and stupidities of specific individuals\", and wrote that the \"best parts\" of the book describe \"scenes of foreign reporting, such as an alarming visit to Vilnius in 1991, where Soviet forces massacred Lithuanian nationalists\". However, Poole also added that the book resorted too much to cultural generalisation.\n\nConservative newspapers and magazines, which had consistently reviewed Hitchens's previous books, largely ignored \"The Broken Compass\". The author bemoaned this in one of his columns, and explored the possible reasons behind it in an article in \"Standpoint\" magazine. An exception to this trend was the Shadow Education Secretary Michael Gove referring at length to the book in his column in \"The Times\", where he wrote that it \"has some passages of quite brilliant writing and it is at its best when Peter reflects on his own life and his disillusionment with the left-wing ideology of his youth\" and that the book \"makes some telling points, which are discomfiting reading for conservatives who value grace and civility in our national life\".\n\nThe book was first published in the UK on 11 May 2009 by Continuum International Publishing Group Ltd., and in the US on 20 June 2009 by Continuum, with the altered subtitle \"How Left and Right Lost Their Meaning\". In anticipation of the 2010 general election, a revised paperback edition with the new title \"The Cameron Delusion\" was released in the UK on 17 March 2010.\n\nPoole in his \"Guardian\" review wrote that \"Hitchens should at least be applauded for taking the trouble to provide an amusing index, a duty shirked by too many authors.\" The index was the subject of a full-page parody by Craig Brown in the magazine \"Private Eye\".\n\n\n"}

The lead decision was given by Bankes LJ. \n\nIt established the conditions under which banks owed confidentiality to their clients, allowing four circumstances wherein banks were not required to guard privacy: where compelled by (1) law, (2) public duty, (3) the interest of the bank, or (4) where the client had consented, even implicitly, to disclosure.\n\nIn this case the bank disclosed to its customer's employer the fact that one of the customer's unpaid cheques was drawn in favour of a bookmaker's account. As a result, the customer's employer did not renew his contract with the customer. The Court of Appeal held that confidentiality was an implied term in the customer's contract and that any breach could give rise to liability in damages if loss results.\n"}
