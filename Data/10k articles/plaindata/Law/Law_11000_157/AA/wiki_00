Founded in 1998, it is based in Kabul, Afghanistan with various regional offices. The company operates as a subsidiary of Telephone Systems International, which is a joint venture between the Bayat Group and the Afghan Ministry of Communications. Afghan Wireless launched the first 4G LTE service in Afghanistan in 2017, at which point it was the largest private employer in the country. It has around five million clients and provides coverage in all of Afghanistan's provinces.\n\nIn 1998, Afghan-American telecommunications entrepreneur Ehsan Bayat won an exclusive license from Afghanistan's Taliban government to create a joint venture with the country's Ministry of Communications, which was given 20% ownership. The deal had been negotiated by investors from the United States, Britain, and Sweden. Afghan Wireless Communications Company, or AWCC, was established as a subsidiary of Telephone Systems International, and financial backing was provided by the British entrepreneurs Stuart Bentham and Lord Michael Cecil. In June 1999 the Taliban granted Afghan Wireless a 15-year monopoly on cell phone traffic in Afghanistan, and within the year Afghan Wireless had re-enabled Afghanistan's international country calling code. In 1999 and 2000 the company set up digital telephone exchanges in the cities of Kabul and Kandahar, replacing the outdated manual telephone switchboards that the country's telecommunications had long relied upon.\n\nAlthough the Taliban were overthrown by an American invasion in 2001, Afghan Wireless was nevertheless the first company licensed to provide GSM wireless service in Afghanistan. With the lifting of the trade embargo, Afghan Wireless brought in technology from American vendors including WorldCom, TECORE Wireless Systems, and AirNet Communications Corporation. Afghan interim leader Hamid Karzai publicly made the first phone call on April 6, 2002, calling and speaking with the Afghan ambassador to the United Nations in New York City. As the network went public using a pre-paid platform, phone booths were set up for those unable to afford cellphones. In June 2002, Argent Networks in New Zealand was contracted to help Afghan Wireless develop its GSM mobile network. The following year Argent also developed a billing system for the network, and competing companies such as Roshan started to appear.\n\nIn 2002 Bayat allegedly attempted to buy out Cecil and Bentham, but the offers were disregarded as \"derisory.\" Bayat and Afghan Wireless subsequently sued Cecil and Bentham for allegedly misappropriating money from the company. Cecil, Bentham, and two other founding investors counter-sued, claiming they had not received over £250 million in due shares and alleging \"fraud, deceit, breach of contract and conspiracy.\" The case was dismissed from American courts and ultimately hidden from public records and dismissed in Bayat's favor in British courts in August 2011.\n\nStarting around 2006, Afghan Wireless was one of five companies with towers damaged and destroyed by the Taliban, with the Taliban demanding that telecommunications companies in the country limit service. The attacks were reported stopped by 2009, with \"The Globe and Mail\" explaining that \"public discontent with service disruptions overwhelmed religious or tribal affiliations.\" By June 2008, Afghan Wireless reported to have 2 million subscribers across all 34 of Afghanistan's provinces. The company had around 5 million users by 2009. In 2011 Afghan Wireless remained partially owned by the Afghan Ministry of Communications, which maintains a 10-20% stake.\n\nIn a 2011 report by \"Vanity Fair\" contributing editor David Rose, it was alleged that Afghan Wireless was linked to an American intelligence project called Operation Foxden, a Federal Bureau of Investigation and National Security Agency endeavor to wiretap Afghan Wireless' infrastructure for intelligence gathering on the Taliban regime. Although allegedly authorized to proceed on September 8, 2001, Operation Foxden was rendered moot by the September 11 attacks and invasion of Afghanistan. Rose claimed that in the operation's planning stages, the FBI and NSA helped transfer ownership of Afghan Wireless to a shell company, Netmobile, in Liechtenstein, to circumnavigate the 1999 Executive Order 13129 ban on American citizens doing business with the Taliban. In response to the article, Bayat denied that American intelligence agencies were behind the change in ownership, and that \"to the contrary, my application for an exemption from U.S. sanctions was denied by the U.S. government.\" Bayat also denied that he or his companies had acted unlawfully, installed wiretaps, or acted as \"an agent, informant or spy.\"\n\nAfghan Wireless launched a mobile-money feature in 2012 involving biometrics. In 2017, the Afghanistan Ministry of Finance gave Afghan Wireless a 'Best Large Taxpayer' award. Afghan Wireless announced it had launched the first 4G LTE service in Afghanistan in May 2017. At the time, Afghan Wireless also claimed to be the largest private employer in Afghanistan, with 8,000 employees. It also as of 2017 partnered with 425 wireless networks spread throughout 125 countries, with five million clients and coverage in all of Afghanistan's 34 provinces. In February 2018, Afghan Wireless announced that its mobile payment service could be used on electricity bills. That March, Afghan Wireless signed a new license agreement with the Afghanistan Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (ATRA) for installation and operation of a fiber optic network. By April 2018, Afghan Wireless remained the only mobile communications company in Afghanistan providing 4G LTE HD. That month it increased pay assistance to its employees attending Kardan University and Rana University.\n\n\n"}

The laws are enforced by the Tobacco and Alcohol Market Regulatory Authority (TAPDK).\n\nThe consumption of alcohol is prohibited in the Islamic faith, but was practised widely in the ruling class of the Ottoman Empire. Murad IV (1612 - 1640) forbade drinking alcohol by law despite being a drinker himself. Turkey has been a secular country since its establishment in 1923, and the consumption of rakı in particular is a significant part of Turkey's food culture. However, today, 83% of adult Turks report being teetotal, and at 1.5 litres per head, alcohol consumption is the lowest in Europe.\n\nIn Turkey, the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages is age limited to persons 18 and over. A governmental act imposed in January 2011 restricted the sale of alcohol at various events to persons under 24 years of age rather than 18 as it was previously established. However, the ban was later overturned by the courts.\n\nTurkey's driving under the influence law gives a blood alcohol content limit of 0.05mg/ml (as of January 2013) and 0 for commercial drivers. Under the new 2013 laws, breaching the drunk driving limit is punishable with a six-month driving ban.\n\nLicences are required in Turkey to sell or serve alcohol (including beer); they are administered by the Tobacco and Alcohol Market Regulatory Authority. In 2008 shops with retail licenses were barred from selling alcohol out of its original packaging, preventing the custom of some shops of setting up chairs and tables outside to become de facto small bars.\n\nIn 2013 the government passed laws limiting retail licenses from 10 pm to 6 am and banning \"student dormitories, health institutions, sports clubs, and all sorts of education institutions and gas stations\" from selling alcohol. 185,000 kiosks with alcohol licenses could be affected.\n\nThe 2013 laws also created additional restrictions on obtaining new licenses. No new licenses would be issued for locations less than 100 metres from a school or mosque. In addition, new licensees would now need to obtain a business permit from the local municipality, and \"a tourism document from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism\" before applying.\n\nThe high tax on the alcoholic beverages, called special consumption tax ( ÖTV), established first in 2002 and dramatically increased in 2010 by the government of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), whose leadership is known for their aversion to alcohol, led to a significant rise in smuggling and fraud involving alcoholic beverages in the country. Bootlegging is blamed for the 2011 Turkish Riviera mass alcohol poisoning.\n\nIn 2013, new laws banned all forms of advertising and promotion for alcoholic beverages, including \"promotions, sponsored activities, festivals and free giveaways.\" Beverage companies ran ads criticizing the ban. \n\nThe law also included a requirement to blur depictions of alcoholic beverages on television and in films, as was already done for cigarettes, and for bottles to carry health warnings similar to tobacco packaging warning messages.\n\nA 2011 ban by the TADPK on advertising in sports meant the basketball team Efes Pilsen had to change its name to Anadolu Efes S.K..\n\n"}
{"id": "22751116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22751116", "title": "Aliens Act 1793", "text": "Aliens Act 1793\n\nThe Aliens Act 1793 (33 Geo 3 c 4) was an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain regulating immigration into the country. Introduced into the House of Lords by Lord Grenville on 19 December 1792, the act was given high priority during the parliamentary session. Despite concerns of Opposition party, the Act became law on 8 January 1793. The Act itself was only temporary, and was renewed and revised by a series of subsequent changes. At end of the war period, the act was revoked. \n\nFrench Emigration (1789-1815) refers to the mass movement of citizens from France to neighbouring countries in reaction to the bloodshed and upheaval caused by the French Revolution and Napoleonic rule. To escape political tensions and save their lives, a number of individuals emigrated from France and settled in the neighbouring countries (chiefly Great Britain, Germany, Austria, and Prussia), however quite a few also went to the United States. The number of refugees fleeing into Britain reached its climax in autumn of 1792. In September alone, a total of nearly 4000 refugees landed in Britain. The country appealed to people because it had a channel separating them from the revolutionaries and because it was known for being tolerant. Emigrants primarily settled in London and Soho, the latter had grown into a thriving French cultural district, complete with French hotels and cuisine, although it had long been a haven for French exiles, housing many thousands of Frenchmen from the last mass migration which occurred in reaction to the 1685 revocation of the Edict of Nantes, and the ensuing Foreign Protestants Naturalization Act 1708.\n\nThe uncontrolled influx of foreigners created significant anxiety in government circles. Particularly, the British Government feared the presence of spies and Jacobin agents disguised as refugees in the country. J. W. Bruges, secretary of the Foreign Office, wrote to Lord Grenville on 14 September: \"By what I can learn, the majority of these people are of a suspicious description, and very likely either to do mischief of their own accord, or to be fit tools of those who may be desirous of creating confusion\". Additionally, the newspapers during the latter part of 1792 emphasized strong public suspicions of \"Frenchmen in England\" and demanded that high control and security measures be placed onto Britain.\n\nTherefore, the Act was aimed to protect and strengthen the country internally. It only helped to regulate who lived in the country; it did not prohibit immigrants. It also enforced that aliens be recorded upon arrival and register with the local justice of the peace. More specifically, those who arrived in Great Britain after January 1793 were required to give their names, ranks, occupations, and addresses. Even those who housed or roomed with an alien had to send similar details. It further held that violators of the act could be held without bail or mainprise, either to be deported or as punishment, a provision that caused critics to decry it as a suspension of \"habeas corpus\"; indeed, its sponsor in Parliament had earlier called it \"a bill for suspending the Habeas Corpus Act, as far as it should relate to the persons of foreigners.\"\n\nDuring the war period, the Act gave an extraordinary power to the government and placed all foreigners in the country at the mercy of the government. All immigrants feared deportation because of either their political views or security reasons, or, simply because they were regarded as an undesirable persons.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3152450", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3152450", "title": "Bava Batra", "text": "Bava Batra\n\nBava Batra (also Baba Batra; Talmudic Aramaic: בבא בתרא \"The Last Gate\") is the third of the three Talmudic tractates in the Talmud in the order Nezikin; it deals with a person's responsibilities and rights as the owner of property. It is part of Judaism's oral law. Originally it, together with Bava Kamma and Bava Metzia, formed a single tractate called \"Nezikin\" (torts or injuries).\n\nThis \"massekhta\" (treatise) is not, like Bava Kamma and Bava Metzia, the exposition of a certain passage in the Torah. It is divided into ten chapters, the contents of which may be described as follows: (1) Regulations relating to property held by more than one owner (ch. i.); (2) responsibilities of an owner of property with regard to that of his neighbor (ch. ii.); (3) established rights of ownership and rights connected with property (ch. iii.); (4) laws referring to the acquisition of property by purchase (ch. iv.-vii.); (5) laws of inheritance (ch. viii.-ix.); (6) laws concerning documents (ch. x.).\n\nIt consists of 176 pages (\"dapim\"), making it the longest tractate of the Talmud.\n\n1. Joint owners of property may dissolve a partnership and divide the property, if the parties consent, except in the case regarding a volume of the Scriptures, which may not be divided under any circumstances (literally, torn in half). Things which lose their value on division can only be divided if all the owners consent. Except in these cases, either party has a right to insist on a division of the property. In the case where a courtyard (\"ḥaẓer\") is owned by several partners, each of them has to contribute to the usual requirements of a court; if they divide it, a partition wall or fence must be erected in accordance with certain rules. The previous partners are now neighbors; and their relations are described in chap. ii.\n\nA courtyard less than 8 amot (approx. 18 inches x 8 = 144 inches) can only be divided if both partners agree to the division. Depending on how the Mishnah is read, this division is either with a low row of wooden pegs (which shows that visual trespass is not damaging) or a four amot (approx. 72 inches) high stone wall (which shows that visual trespass is considered damaging). If both partners agree to the stone wall, it is built in the middle. The lesson taught here is that if one partner owns more property, he does not need to contribute more space for the stones of the wall.\n\n2. The fundamental rule about neighboring property is that the owner of the adjoining property must avoid everything that might prove a nuisance to the neighbor, or become a source of injury to the neighbor's property. \"The noise of a smith's hammer, of a mill, or of children in school, is not to be considered a nuisance\" (ii. 3). Disputes as regards to injury or nuisance are generally settled by the fact of prior or established rights (Ḥazaḳah).\n\n3. \"Ḥazaḳah\" (established right, possession de facto) is proved by the undisturbed exercise of such a right during a certain period (three years), in spite of the presence of the rival claimant in the same \"land.\" In this respect Israel was divided into three \"lands\" or districts (iii. 2): Judah, Galilee, and Peræa.\n\n4. In the transfer of a house, a court, a winepress, a bath, a township, or a field, much depends on the meaning of these terms, which are fully defined in chap. iv. In the Mishnah similar definitions are given of a boat, a cart, a yoke of oxen, and the like (v. 1-5). In selling the produce of the field care must be taken that there be no deviation from the conditions of the sale as regards quality and quantity, lest the sale be declared invalid (\"meḳaḥ ṭa'ut,\" v. 6-vi. 3). Various problems resulting from the sale of property, of a house, or of a piece of land are discussed in the Mishnah (vi. 4-vii.); among them the sale of land for a burialground for a family, or the undertaking by a workman to prepare it (vi. 8). The burial-place is described as follows: \"A cave hewn out in a rock 4 cubits broad and 6 cubits long (or, according to R. Simeon, 6 by 8 cubits); along the length of the cave on each side there are three graves of 4 cubits long, 1 cubit broad, and 7 handbreadths ('ṭefaḥim') high; and 2 such graves in the back of the cave. In front of the cave was the court ('ḥaẓer') 6 by 6 cubits, so as to afford sufficient room for the bier and the persons attending the burial.\"\n\n5. The laws of inheritance are based on Numbers xxvii. 8-11, as interpreted by tradition. Among these is the rule that the husband inherits the property of his deceased wife, her claim in case of the husband's death being settled in the marriage contract (Ketubah). Another rule gives to the first-born son a double share of his deceased father's property. Thus the daughters of Zelophehad are said to have claimed, as their father's property, three shares of the Holy Land (which is assumed to have been divided among the 600,000 men brought out of Egypt); namely, the share of Zelophehad and, as a first-born son of Hefer, a double share of the property of his deceased father (viii. 3). These laws do not interfere with the right of a man to donate his property according to his pleasure (viii. 5).\n\nComplicated cases are dealt with in chap. ix.; such as the simultaneous claims of the heirs, the wife, and the creditors of the deceased; or the conflicting claims of the heirs of the husband and of those of the wife, where the husband and wife are found dead at the same time; the heirs of the former contending that she died first, and that by her death her property became the property of the husband; while the other party contends that he died first, and that the wife's heirs inherit her property.\n\n6. As legal documents are of great importance in the problems dealt with in the three Babas, a chapter is added, containing regulations concerning the writing of such documents. Of these one peculiarity may be mentioned; namely, the difference between \"geṭ pashuṭ,\" a simple, unfolded document, and \"geṭ meḳushshar,\" a folded document. The latter was prepared in the following way: When a line or two had been written the parchment was folded and one witness signed on the back of the document; this operation was repeated as many times as the parties concerned liked. This method, requiring a longer time for the execution of the document, is said to have been originally introduced for the writing of a letter of divorce in the case of hasty and passionate husbands (especially priests who were prevented by law from remarrying their divorced wives), to give them time to calm down (B. B. 160b). The massekta of the three Babas closes with a general remark on the educational value of the study of civil law.\n"}

E-20.2) is a Quebec law concerning the consequences of any future referendum on independence; it was enacted in 2000 in response to the enactment of the federal Clarity Act by the Parliament of Canada. The full official title of the law is \"An Act respecting the exercise of the fundamental rights and prerogatives of the Québec people and the Québec State\" (). It has no formal short title and so is commonly referred to as \"Bill 99\", the designation under which it was introduced in the Quebec legislature by the Parti Québécois.\n\nThe Act was introduced by Joseph Facal to the National Assembly of Quebec in emergency on 15 December 1999, two days after the introduction of the Clarity Act before the House of Commons of Canada. It was adopted on 7 December 2000, by a majority of 69 against 41. The bill was opposed by Liberal leader Jean Charest, who would have preferred the National Assembly pass a motion rather than a law.\n\nWhereas the federal act states that, in the case of a referendum about the secession of a Canadian province, the House of Commons has the power to determine afterwards whether the question was clear enough and whether the obtained majority was large enough for the result to be accepted, the provincial act stipulates that Quebecers may determine unilaterally how to exercise their right to choose their political regime, including sovereignty, and that the winning option in a referendum is whichever obtains 50% of the votes plus one. Both acts are mandates given to their respective governments.\n\nWhile opposed to Bill 99, the opposition Liberal Party tabled a motion agreeing with many of its central provisions, including the right of Quebec to decide any referendum question and the 50%-plus-one rule.\n\nThe motivating force behind passage of Bill 99 was to ensure that, even in the absence a referendum, Quebec's political fate could result only from decisions made by Quebecers and not by other Canadians. The constitutional validity of both the Clarity Act and Bill 99 has been questioned, however, with respect to the Constitution Act 1867's allocation of legislative powers between the federal and provincial government.\n\nIn August 2007, three justices of the Quebec Court of Appeal unanimously held that Keith Henderson, former Leader of the English-language rights group, the Equality Party, has standing to challenge the legality of the statute, which Quebec Superior Court has dubbed \"Bill 99\" in the absence of a short title for this particular statute. In 2018, the Quebec Superior Court ruled that Bill 99 was constitutional, as its wording did not actually authorize a unilateral declaration of independence.\n\n"}

A member of the New Democratic Party (NDP), Angus has been the federal Member of Parliament for the riding of Timmins—James Bay since winning the 2004 election. He is the NDP critic for Indigenous and Northern Affairs (Youth), and ran as a candidate for leadership of the federal NDP in 2017.\n\nAngus was born in Timmins, Ontario and moved to Toronto in 1973, where in 1980 he co-founded the punk rock band L'Étranger with childhood friend Andrew Cash. He performed bass and co-wrote many of the group's songs, which were influenced by the Clash and the group's Catholic social justice roots. L'Étranger is best known for their anti-apartheid single \"One People\", one of the first independent videos to play on the then-new MuchMusic. He later co-founded the alternative folk group Grievous Angels, garnering much acclaim in the Canadian music scene, including two Juno Award nominations. He continues to perform with the group.\n\nAngus was a community activist in Toronto in the 1980s where, along with his wife Brit Griffin, he established a Catholic Worker house, and a homeless shelter for men. He moved to Cobalt, Ontario, with his young family in 1990, and in 1995 Brit and Charlie launched \"HighGrader\", a magazine devoted to Northern Ontario life and culture. In 1999, he was awarded the Jackie Washington Award by the Northern Lights Festival Boréal in Sudbury for his outstanding contributions to Northern Ontario culture.\n\nHe is the author of seven published books, including an admiring biography of Les Costello, the celebrated Toronto Maple Leafs player who left professional hockey to become a Catholic priest in Timmins. Angus's fifth book, \"Cage Call\", a photo documentary with photographer Louie Palu, was released in 2007 as part of an award from Portland-based PhotoLucida. His sixth book \"Unlikely Radicals: The Story of the Adams Mine Dump War\" was short-listed for the Speakers Book Award, Legislative Assembly of Ontario, 2013, and was the runner-up for the Best Regional Non-Fiction (Canada-East), Independent Publisher Book Awards, 2013.\n\nAngus is a progressive, social justice–oriented member of the Roman Catholic Church, a supporter of the Catholic Worker Movement, and was a longtime columnist for the progressive \"Catholic New Times.\" He became increasingly involved in regional and then federal politics through his organizing efforts in opposition to the Adams Mine garbage proposal and the disposal of PCBs in Northern Ontario.\n\nAngus entered federal politics in the 2004 election as the successful New Democratic Party candidate in the Ontario riding of Timmins—James Bay, winning election to the House of Commons of Canada by less than 600 votes. He was re-elected in the 2006 federal election with a majority, over six thousand votes ahead of Liberal challenger Robert Riopelle. Angus was the NDP parliamentary critic for Canadian Heritage from 2004 to 2007, and was additionally critic for agriculture from 2004 to 2006.\n\nIn 2005, his own priest confronted him, and threatened to deny him Holy Communion if he voted with the government and his party to legalize same-sex marriage by Act of Parliament. Angus stood his ground and was denied communion. Angus' treatment provoked widespread public reaction both from those who supported the church's stance, and those who supported Angus.\n\nHe has worked extensively on community development projects with Canada's First Nations, working as a negotiator and consultant for the Algonquin Nation of Quebec. He also played a prominent role in calling national attention to the Kashechewan crisis of 2005.\n\nIn 2007 he became the critic for Public Works and Treasury Board, as well as the NDP spokesman for digital issues such as copyright and internet neutrality.\n\nIn 2006, after just two years as a Member of Parliament, the \"Toronto Star\" selected Angus as one of the ten most effective opposition MPs. He also won \"Best Constituent Representative\" at the 2007 \"Maclean's\" Parliamentarian of the Year Awards. Angus was re-elected in both the 2008 federal election and the 2011 federal election. Angus also served as the party's spokesman on privacy, ethics and government accountability. Angus voted against a bill to abolish the Canadian Firearms Registry in September 2010. Although the registry is unpopular with many of his constituents, Angus voted against its abolition based on supportive studies provided by police. He subsequently introduced a private member's bill to reform the registry.\n\nHe was named to \"Maclean's\" magazine's Power List in 2012 as one of the 25 most influential Canadians. \"Zoomer Magazine\" has chosen him the third most influential Canadian over the age of 45. In 2011, CTV News Channel's \"Power Play\" chose him in the top three MPs of the year, along with Stephen Harper and Jack Layton.\n\nAngus has been an advocate for the rights of First Nation children and was the co-founder of the Shannen's Dream campaign – named in honour of the late Cree youth leader Shannen Koostachin. In early 2012, Angus' Parliamentary Motion \"Shannens Dream\" calling for an end to the systemic under-funding of First Nation education passed unanimously through the House of Commons.\n\nAfter the 2015 federal election, he was appointed NDP critic for Indigenous and Northern Affairs in the 42nd Canadian Parliament and elected Caucus Chair in January 2016. He was also a member of the Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development committee. He resigned from both roles on November 23, 2016 in to prepare for the 2017 New Democratic Party leadership race. On February 20, 2017, Angus officially registered to run in the NDP leadership race to replace Tom Mulcair. He placed second with 19.4% of the vote, losing to Jagmeet Singh.\n\nAngus lives in Cobalt, Ontario with his wife of 30 years. They have three children.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "146700", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=146700", "title": "Deadly force", "text": "Deadly force\n\nDeadly force, also known as lethal force, is use of force that is likely to cause serious bodily injury or death to another person. In most jurisdictions, the use of deadly force is justified only under conditions of extreme necessity as a last resort, when all lesser means have failed or cannot reasonably be employed.\n\nFirearms, bladed weapons, explosives, and vehicles are among those weapons the use of which is considered deadly force. The use of non-traditional weapons in an offensive manner, such as a baseball bat, sharp pencil, tire iron or other, may also be considered deadly force.\n\nThe United States Armed Forces defines deadly force as \"force that a person uses causing, or that a person knows or should know would create a substantial risk of causing, death or serious bodily harm or injury\".\nIn the United States, the use of deadly force by sworn law enforcement officers is lawful when the officer reasonably believes the subject poses a significant threat of serious bodily injury or death to themselves or others. The use of deadly force by law enforcement is also lawful when used to prevent the escape of a fleeing felon when the officer believes escape would pose a significant threat of serious bodily injury or death to members of the public. Common law allowed officers to use any force necessary to effect a felony arrest but this was narrowed in the \"Tennessee v. Garner\" ruling in 1985 when the U.S. Supreme Court said that \"deadly force...may not be used unless necessary to prevent the escape and the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious bodily harm to the officer or others.\" \n\nIn the 1989 \"Graham v. Connor\" ruling, the Supreme Court expanded its definition to include \"objective reasonableness\" standard—not subjective as to what the officer's intent might have been—and it must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer at the scene—and its calculus must embody the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second decisions about the amount of force necessary in a particular situation.\n\nMost law enforcement agencies establish a use of force continuum starting with simple presence through deadly force. With this model, officers attempt to control subjects and situations with the minimum force necessary. Agencies often have policies limiting the force used to be equal or one step higher on the continuum to the force they are opposing.\n\nA civilian's use of deadly force is generally justified if he or she reasonably believe that he or she is or other innocent lives are in imminent danger of death or serious injury. Justification and affirmative defenses vary by state and may include certain property crimes, specific crimes against children or prevention of sexual assaults. \n\nU.S. law requires an investigation whenever a person causes another person's death, but the mechanism for such investigations can vary by state. The investigation develops evidence regarding the use of deadly physical force for the particular state or jurisdiction. An investigation may performed by a local or state police agency and also a civilian agency, such as a county prosecutor or State Attorney General. A report of the findings of such an investigation may be submitted for prosecution and made public.\n\nIn , the (U.S. Supreme Court 2007) held that a police officer's attempt to terminate a dangerous high-speed car chase that threatened the lives of innocent bystanders did not violate the Fourth Amendment, even when it places the fleeing motorist at risk of serious bodily injury or death. In the \"Harris\" case, Officer Scott applied his police car's push bumper to the rear of the suspect's vehicle, causing the suspect vehicle to lose control and crash, resulting in the fleeing suspect being paralyzed from the waist down.\n\nTraditionally, intentional contact between vehicles has been characterized as unlawful deadly force, though some U.S. federal appellate cases have mitigated this precedent. In\nthe Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that although fatalities may result from intentional collisions between automobiles such fatalities are infrequent, and therefore unlawful deadly force should not be presumed to be the level of force applied in such incidents; the Adams case was subsequently called into question by\n, which in turn was reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court in the \"Scott v. Harris\" case discussed above; the extent to which \"Adams\" can continue to be relied on is uncertain. In the \"Adams\" case, the officer rammed the suspect's vehicle.\n\nIn\n, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals recognized this principle but added that collisions between automobiles and motorcycles frequently lead to the death of the motorcyclist, and therefore a presumption that unlawful deadly force was used in such intentional collisions is more appropriate. In the \"Donovan\" case, the suspect lost control of his motorcycle and became airborne, crashing into the officer's vehicle, which was parked as part of an intercepting roadblock.\n"}

It was reaffirmed by the League in 1934. Heads of State and Government pledged to incorporate its principles in domestic legislation. In France, it was ordered to be displayed in every school.\n\nThe original document, in the archives of the city of Geneva, carries the signatures of various international delegates, including Jebb, Janusz Korczak, and Gustave Ador, a former President of the Swiss Confederation.\n\nAfter considering a number of options, including that of drafting an entirely new declaration, the United Nations resolved in 1946 to adopt the document, in a much expanded version, as its own statement of children's rights. Many different governments were involved in the drafting process. A slightly expanded version, with seven points in place of five, was adopted in 1948. Then on 20 November 1959 the United Nations General Assembly adopted a Declaration of the Rights of the Child, based on the structure and contents of the 1924 original, with ten principles. An accompanying resolution, proposed by the delegation of Afghanistan, called on governments to recognise these rights, strive for their acceptance, and publicise the document as widely as possible.

{"id": "4148087", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4148087", "title": "Displacement ventilation", "text": "Displacement ventilation\n\nDisplacement ventilation (DV) It is a room air distribution strategy where conditioned outdoor air is supplied at a low velocity from air supply diffusers located near floor level and extracted above the occupied zone, usually at ceiling height.\n\nA typical displacement ventilation system, such as one in an office space, supplies conditioned cold air from an air handling unit (AHU) through a low induction air diffuser. Diffuser types vary by applications. Diffusers can be located against a wall (\"wall-mounted\"), at the corner of a room (\"corner-mounted\"), or above the floor but not against a wall (\"free-standing\"). The cool air accelerates because of the\nbuoyancy force, spreads in a thin layer over the floor,\nreaching a relatively high velocity before rising due to heat exchange with heat sources (e.g., occupants, computers, lights). Absorbing the heat from heat sources, the cold air becomes warmer and less dense. The density difference between cold air and warm air creates upward convective flows known as thermal plumes. Instead of working as a stand-alone system in interior space, displacement ventilation system can also be coupled with other cooling and heating sources, such as radiant chilled ceilings or baseboard heating.\n\nDisplacement ventilation was first applied in an industrial building in Scandinavia in 1978, and has frequently been used in similar applications, as well as office spaces, throughout Scandinavia since that time. By 1989, it was estimated that Displacement ventilation comprised the 50% in industrial applications and 25% in offices within Nordic countries. Applications in the United States have not been as widespread as in Scandinavia. Some research has been done to assess the practicality of this application in U.S. markets due to different typical space designs and application in hot and humid climates, as well as research to assess the potential indoor environmental quality and energy-saving benefits of this strategy in the U.S. and elsewhere.\n\nDisplacement ventilation has been applied in many famous building such as the Suvarnabhumi International Airport in Bangkok, Thailand, the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory Flight Projects Center building, and the San Francisco International Airport Terminal 2 among other applications.\n\nThe thermal plumes and supply air from diffusers, which determines the velocity of airflow at floor level, play an important role in DV systems. It is necessary to carefully set the airflow rate from the diffuser to avoid drafts.\n\nDue to the unique properties of thermal stratification, Displacement ventilation is typically used for cooling rather than for heating. In many cases, a separate heating source, such as a radiator or baseboard, is used in during heating periods.\n\nDisplacement ventilation is best suited for taller spaces (higher than 3 meters [10 feet]). Standard mixing ventilation may be better suited for smaller spaces where air quality is not as great a concern, such as single-occupant offices, and where the room height is not tall (e.g., lower than 2.3 meters [7.5 feet]).\n\nDisplacement ventilation systems are quieter than conventional overhead systems with better ventilation efficiency. Hence, it could enhance indoor air quality and provide desirable acoustic environment. Displacement ventilation systems are appropriate in space where high ventilation is required, such as classrooms, conference rooms, and offices.\n\nDisplacement ventilation can be a cause of discomfort due to the large vertical temperature gradient and drafts. According to Melikov and Pitchurov's research, sensations of cold caused by vertical temperature difference and draft are usually occurred at the lower leg/ ankle/ feet region, while warm sensations at the head are reported. The research also indicates, that the draft rating model could predict the draft risk with good accuracy in rooms with displacement ventilation systems.\n\nThere is a tradeoff inherent in these two issues: by increasing the flow rate (and the ability to remove greater thermal loads), the vertical temperature gradient can be reduced, but this could increase the risk of drafts. Pairing displacement ventilation with radiant chilled ceilings is an effort to mitigate this problem. According to some studies, displacement ventilation systems can only provide acceptable comfort if the corresponding cooling load is less than about 13 Btu/h-sf or 40 W/m.\n\nOne benefit of displacement ventilation is possibly the superior indoor air quality achieved with exhausting contaminated air out of the room. Better air quality is achieved when the pollution source is also a heat source.\n\nSome studies have demonstrated that displacement ventilation may save energy as compared to standard mixing ventilation, depending on the use type of the building, design/massing/orientation, and other factors. However, for the evaluation of energy consumption of displacement ventilation, the numerical simulation is the main method, since yearly measurements are too expensive and time consuming. Hence, whether displacement ventilation could help with saving energy is still debated.In general, displacement ventilation is attractive to the core region in a building since no heating is needed. However, the perimeter zones require high cooling energy.\n\nDifferent guidelines have been published to provide guidance on designing displacement ventilation systems, including:\nAmong guidelines listed above, the one developed by Chen and Glicksman are aimed specifically at fulfilling U.S. Standard. Below is a brief description of each step of their guideline.\n\nStep 1) Judge the applicability of displacement ventilation\n\nStep 2) Calculate summer design cooling load.\n\nStep 3) Determine the required flow rate of the supply air for summer cooling.\n\nStep 4) Find the required flow rate of fresh air for acceptable indoor air quality.\n\nStep 5) Determine the supply air flow rate.\n\nStep 6) Calculate the supply airflow rate.\n\nStep 7) Determine the ratio of the fresh air to the supply air.\n\nStep 8) Select supply air diffuser size and number.\n\nStep 9) Check the winter heating situation.\n\nStep 10) Estimate the first costs and annual energy consumption.\n"}

Further discussion and amendments were made by the Commission on Human Rights, the Economic and Social Council and the General Assembly of the United Nations.\n\nMembers of the Commission who contributed significantly to the creation of the Declaration included Canadian John Peters Humphrey of the United Nations Secretariat, Eleanor Roosevelt of the United States (who chaired the Drafting Committee), René Cassin of France, Charles Malik of Lebanon, P. C. Chang of Republic of China (Taiwan), and Hansa Mehta of India among others. While not a member of the drafting committee, the French philosopher Jacques Maritain was influential in the lead up to the drafting of the Universal Declaration, advocacy for it within UNESCO in 1947-8, and in its subsequent advancement.\n\nThe Drafting Committee included\nJohn Peters Humphrey was newly appointed as Director of the Division of Human Rights within the United Nations Secretariat. In this role, he produced the first draft of a list of rights that were to form the basis of the Declaration.\nThe underlying structure of the Universal Declaration was introduced in its second draft which was prepared by René Cassin working from the Humphrey draft. The structure was influenced by the Code Napoleon, including a preamble and introductory general principles.\n\nCassin compared the Declaration to the portico of a Greek temple, with a foundation, steps, four columns and a pediment. Articles 1 and 2 are the foundation blocks, with their principles of dignity, liberty, equality and brotherhood. The seven paragraphs of the preamble, setting out the reasons for the Declaration, are represented by the steps. The main body of the Declaration forms the four columns. The first column (articles 3-11) constitutes rights of the individual, such as the right to life and the prohibition of slavery. The second column (articles 12-17) constitutes the rights of the individual in civil and political society. The third column (articles 18-21) is concerned with spiritual, public and political freedoms such as freedom of religion and freedom of association. The fourth column (articles 22-27) sets out social, economic and cultural rights.\n\nIn Cassin's model, the last three articles of the Declaration provide the pediment which binds the structure together. These articles are concerned with the duty of the individual to society and the prohibition of use of rights in contravention of the purposes of the United Nations.\n\nThe Cassin draft was submitted to the Commission on Human Rights and was to undergo editing in the Commission, then in further drafts considered by the Third Committee of the United Nations, and finally in a draft before the General Assembly of the United Nations, which ultimately adopted the Declaration on 10 December 1948. The vote for the declaration was 48 to 0 with eight abstentions: the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, Czechoslovakia, the People's Republic of Poland, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, the Union of South Africa, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n\nThe first controversy to resolve was related to the very origin of the human rights, basically the discussion between the supporters of the concepts of natural rights (which humans are endowed by God or Nature) and positive rights (which humans acquire as a result of a rational agreement).\n\nThe second controversy was basically between the positions of the Marxist theory of the Soviet Bloc and the liberal theory of the Western World. In philosophical terms, the Soviet Bloc criticized the individualist stance of the issue, arguing in favor of the collectivism approach, where the rights of the collective dominate that of an individual. In political terms, the Soviet Union and its satellites, facing mounting accusations of human rights violations (and defending itself in the \"And you are lynching Negroes\" style), argued that the declaration is a mere formality if it would not consider guarantees of economic and social rights. However these objections were of surprisingly little consequence, because the Soviet Block was not very active during the seating of the Commission, perhaps indicating a preestablished decision not to sign the Declaration.\n\nAnother issue is the legal status of the declaration. The majority considered the document to be mainly of moral character. At the same time some participants argued in favor of adding certain legal aspects in terms of international law.\n\nBritish representatives in particular were extremely frustrated that the proposal had moral but no legal obligation. (It was not until 1976 that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights came into force, giving a legal status to most of the Declaration) \n\nSource: United Nations Year Book 1948-1949, pp. 524 et seq\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "47863083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47863083", "title": "Election Commission of India", "text": "Election Commission of India\n\nThe Election Commission of India is an autonomous constitutional authority responsible for administering election processes in India. The body administers elections to the Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha, state Legislative Assemblies in India, and the offices of the President and Vice President in the country. The Election Commission operates under the authority of Constitution per \"Article 324\", and subsequently enacted Representation of the People Act. The commission has the powers under the Constitution, to act in an appropriate manner when the enacted laws make insufficient provisions to deal with a given situation in the conduct of an election. Being a constitutional authority, Election Commission is amongst the few institutions which function with both autonomy and freedom, along with the country’s higher judiciary, the Union Public Service Commission and the Comptroller and Auditor General of India.\n\nOriginally in 1950, the commission had only a Chief Election Commissioner. Two additional Commissioners were appointed to the commission for the first time on 16 October 1989 but they had a very short tenure, ending on 1 January 1990. \"The Election Commissioner Amendment Act, 1989\" made the commission a multi-member body. The concept of a 3-member Commission has been in operation since then, with the decisions being made by a majority vote. The Chief Election Commissioner and the two Election Commissioners who are usually retired IAS officers draw salaries and allowances as per with those of the Judges of the Supreme Court of India as per the \"Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners (Conditions of Service) Rules, 1992\".\n\nThe commission is served by its secretariat located in New Delhi. The Election Commissioners are assisted by Deputy Election Commissioners, who are generally IAS officers. They are further assisted by Directors General, Principal Secretaries, and Secretaries and Under Secretaries.\n\nAt the state level, Election Commission is assisted by the Chief Electoral Officer of the State, who is an IAS officer of Principal Secretary rank. At the district and constituency levels, the District Magistrates (in their capacity as District Election Officers), Electoral Registration Officers and Returning Officers perform election work.\n\nThe Chief Election Commissioner of India can be removed from his office similar to the removal of a judge of the Supreme Court of India which requires a resolution passed by the Parliament with a two-thirds majority in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha on the grounds of proved misbehavior or incapacity. Other Election Commissioners can be removed by the President of India on the recommendation of the Chief Election Commissioner. A Chief Election Commissioner has never been impeached in India. In 2009, just before the 2009 Lok Sabha Elections, Chief Election Commissioner N. Gopalaswami sent a recommendation to President Prathibha Patil to remove Election Commissioner Navin Chawla, who was soon to take office as the chief election commissioner and to subsequently supervise the Lok Sabha Election, citing his partisan behavior in favor of one political party. The President opined that such a recommendation is not binding on the president, and hence rejected it. Subsequently, after Gopalswami's retirement the next month, Chawla became the chief election commissioner and supervised the 2009 Lok Sabha Elections.\n\nOne of the most important features of the democratic policy is elections at regular intervals. Holding periodic, free and fair elections are essentials of a democratic system and a part of the basic structure of the Constitution. The Election Commission is regarded as the guardian of elections in the country. In every election, it issues a Model code of Conduct for political parties and candidates to conduct elections in a free and fair manner. The commission issued the code for the first time in 1971 for the 5th Lok Sabha elections and revised it from time to time. It lays down guidelines for the conduct of political parties and candidates during an election period. However, there have been instances of violation of the code by various political parties with complaints being received for misuse of official machinery by the candidates. The code does not have any specific statutory basis but only a persuasive effect. It contains the rules of electoral morality. However, this lack of statutory backing does not prevent the commission from enforcing it.\n\nA law regarding the registration process for political parties was enacted in 1989 and a number of parties got registered with the commission. The registration helps avoid confusion ensures that the political parties are brought under the purview of the commission.\n\nThe election commission has the right to allow symbols to the political parties. It gives recognition to the national parties, state parties and regional parties. It set limits on poll expenses. The commission prepare electoral rolls and update the voter's list from time to time. Notifications of dates and schedules of election for filing nominations are issued by the commission. It is noteworthy that Election commission cannot allot same symbol to two regional political parties even if they are not in the same state.\n\nThe commission can issue an order for prohibition of publication and disseminating of results of opinion polls or exit polls to prevent influencing the voting trends in the electorate.\n\nTo curb the growing influence of money during elections, the Election Commission has made many suggestions and changes in this regard. The commission has appointed IRS officers of the Income Tax Department as Election Observers (Expenditure) of all elections and has fixed the legal limits on the amount of money which a candidate can spend during election campaigns. These limits have been revised over time. The Election Commission, by appointing expenditure observers from the Indian Revenue Service, keeps an eye on the individual account of election expenditure. The commission takes details of the candidate's assets on affidavit at the time of submitting nomination paper, who are also required to give details of their expenditure within 30 days of the declaration of results. The campaign period has also been reduced by the commission from 21 to 14 days for Lok Sabha and Assembly elections to cut down election expenditure.\n\nIn an attempt to decriminalise politics, the Election Commission has approached the Supreme Court to put a lifetime ban on convicted politicians from contesting elections.\n\nThe Election Commission had tried to bring improvements in election procedures by the introduction of Electronic voting machines or EVMs. It was thought that these would reduce malpractices and improve efficiency. It was first tried out on an experimental basis in the state of Kerala for the 1982 Legislative Assembly Elections. After a successful testing and the legal inquiries, the commission took the decision to begin the use of these voting machines. The Election Commission launched a web site of its own on 28 February 1998 in order to provide accurate information, management, administration and instant results of the elections. In an effort to prevent electoral fraud, in 1993, EPICs or Electors Photo Identity Cards were issued, which became mandatory by the 2004 elections. However ration cards have been allowed for election purposes in certain situations. In 1998, the commission decided on a programme for the 'computerisation' of the electoral rolls. The introduction of Voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) in eight Lok Sabha constituencies in 2014 Indian General Elections was a big achievement for the Election Commission. This Voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) system was first used with EVMs in a by-poll in September 2013 in Noksen (Assembly Constituency) in Nagaland. and eventually in all elections from September 2013 onwards in various Legislative elections in the country.In 2014, None of the above or NOTA was also added as an option on the voting machines which is now a mandatory option to be provided in any election. The specific symbol for NOTA, a ballot paper with a black cross across it, was introduced on 18 September 2015. The symbol has been designed by National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad. With the Bihar Legislative Assembly election, 2015, the state became the first to have photo electoral rolls, with photographs of the candidates on the EVMs.\n\nThe Election Commission of India came under severe criticism when an RTI application filed by activist Dr Satendra Singh revealed the commission's ill-preparedness to safeguard electors with disabilities in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.

{"id": "34567598", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34567598", "title": "Free Internet Act", "text": "Free Internet Act\n\nThe Freedom of Internet Act (formerly Free Internet Act) is an act aimed to legislate the Internet and its uses worldwide, as an alternative to SOPA and PIPA. The idea was originated in a Reddit post and the act is being developed in a subsection of Reddit specifically created for this purpose. As one of the first instances of crowd sourcing legislation, it has raised questions concerning public participation in government in the 21st century. The act passed January 12, 2012.\n\nEarly articles by blog site Techdirt and technology news site Techspot show that there is an interest to see how this proposal will pan out in the wake of the successful Reddit campaign to halt the passage of SOPA and PIPA. Some technology journalists wrote tongue-in-cheek commentaries on the situation. Covered by RT, Alexis Ohanian, Co-founder of Reddit, explained that\n\nThis is definitely a first, but I'll tell you we are in uncharted territory. This is a community that a few years ago decided it was going to be a good idea to have the worlds largest secret santa exchange, and \"did it\". And entire websites have been devoted to this, and now twice a year you can exchange secret santa gifts with people all across the world. It just kind of works. And it's this decentralized magic, that has done so much for the SOPA and PIPA fight thus far, yeah I wouldn't put anything past them. Now there is still a long way to go from great discussions online to actual legislation, but what's really excited is that what's come out of the backlash is that there are legislators, there are senators and representatives who are actually listening.\n\nIn preparation for drafting of the proposed legislation, the community of individuals involved have created threads of discussion and debate dedicated to answering the broad questions associated with legislation of this kind. The topics include:\n\nArticle VII Section B of the Act states that “Everything a user does with their computer is considered private.” Any actions a user takes to protect their privacy, such as using proxies, cannot be assumed to be used for illegal actions. The Act classifies the following as private data: all data that can personally identify the owner, harm the owner in any way, data that has not been explicitly agreed to be public, and all encrypted data is considered to be private. Additionally, data collected for judicial proceedings must be able to be used as evidence. According to the act: “Any data absorbed during the search for evidence must be returned to its owner within 15 business days. Any copies of data not used as evidence must be permanently deleted and removed from any kind of storage.” However, content that a user knows is illegal to upload in a given region is not considered private data (for example, child pornography). Users who download such data and who neglect to report it are also liable for the data.\n\nThe Act proposes that all sovereign Federal and State Governments cannot censor any kind of material on the Internet other than child pornography and financial scams, and in order to censor those topics, it must be done after they are uploaded because it would be illegal to monitor any data while it is being uploaded. Additionally, only the creator or uploader can be held responsible for illegal material, and any time material is removed, the uploader must be notified.\n\nBy prohibiting censorship of the internet, the FIA would carry this most basic American right on to the internet. In the most recent draft of the act, it states that the “FIA will allow internet users to browse freely without any means of censorship, users have the right to free speech and to free knowledge; we govern the content of the internet, governments don’t.” With no legal government presiding over online content, one would be able to freely post, share, and say whatever one desired on the internet.\n\nKevin Lincoln, a writer for Business Insider, argued that the Act is extremely weak in protecting copyright because under the act, content that may infringe on copyright can only be policed after it is uploaded. Only the uploader, not the website hosting possibly illegal content, would be penalized. To prove that someone violated copyright, the accuser must prove that the uploader knew they were uploading illegal content and they didn’t know they were uploading it for Fair Use. The accused person must be notified 30 days before the content is taken down so they have adequate time to fight the claim. Monitoring of content being downloaded, uploaded or edited would not be allowed without legal permission, and to try to remove content without a court order would be considered against the freedom of speech and the perpetrator would be subject to legal penalty.\n\nTechspot published an article that questioned whether the Reddit community effort would be able to produce a successful bill. A Business Insider article alleges that the proposed bill \"is so weak in protecting copyright that it would likely revert the Internet back to a Wild West-type situation where more or less anything goes.\" The article concludes that the bill would make violation of copyright widespread and copyright litigation difficult due to increased burdens of proof and increased immunity for hosting.\n\nInside of Reddit, community members have voiced concern about both the direction of the bill and language used in it, suggesting that the use of the community contributions instead of a professional group to draft the bill will decrease the quality of the bill.\n\n"}

{"id": "427590", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=427590", "title": "High treason in the United Kingdom", "text": "High treason in the United Kingdom\n\nUnder the law of the United Kingdom, high treason is the crime of disloyalty to the Crown. Offences constituting high treason include plotting the murder of the sovereign; committing adultery with the sovereign's consort, with the sovereign's eldest unmarried daughter, or with the wife of the heir to the throne; levying war against the sovereign and adhering to the sovereign's enemies, giving them aid or comfort; and attempting to undermine the lawfully established line of succession. Several other crimes have historically been categorised as high treason, including counterfeiting money and being a Catholic priest.\n\nHigh treason was generally distinguished from petty treason, a treason committed against a subject of the sovereign, the scope of which was limited by statute to the murder of a legal superior. Petty treason comprised the murder of a master by his servant, of a husband by his wife, or of a bishop. Petty treason ceased to be a distinct offence from murder in 1828, and consequently high treason is today often referred to simply as treason.\n\nConsidered to be the most serious of offences, high treason was often met with extraordinary punishment, because it threatened the safety of the state. Hanging, drawing and quartering was the usual punishment until the 19th century. The last treason trial was that of William Joyce, \"Lord Haw-Haw\", who was executed by hanging in 1946.\n\nSince the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 became law, the maximum sentence for treason in the UK has been life imprisonment.\n\nHigh treason today consists of:\n\n\"See the English History section below for detail about the offences created by the 1351 Act.\"\n\nIn addition to the crime of treason, the Treason Felony Act 1848 (still in force today) created a new offence known as \"treason felony\", with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment instead of death (but today, due to the abolition of the death penalty, the maximum penalty both for high treason and treason felony would be the same—life imprisonment). Under the traditional categorisation of offences into treason, felonies, and misdemeanours, treason felony was merely another form of felony. Several categories of treason which had been introduced by the Sedition Act 1661 were reduced to felonies. While the common law offences of misprision and compounding were abolished in respect of felonies (including treason felony) by the Criminal Law Act 1967, which abolished the distinction between misdemeanour and felony, misprision of treason and compounding treason are still offences under the common law.\n\nAccording to the law in force, it is treason felony to \"compass, imagine, invent, devise, or intend\":\n\n\nIn addition to the Acts of 1351, 1703, and 1848, two additional Acts passed by the old Parliament of Ireland apply to Northern Ireland alone. The following is also treason:\n(Note that although the Irish Act of Supremacy (Ireland) 1560 is still in force, it is no longer treason to contravene it.)\n\nIn England, there was no clear common law definition of treason; it was for the king and his judges to determine if an offence constituted treason. Thus, the process became open to abuse, and decisions were often arbitrary. For instance, during the reign of Edward III, a knight was convicted of treason because he assaulted one of the king's subjects and held him for a ransom of £90. It was only in 1351 that Parliament passed legislation on the subject of treason. Under the Treason Act 1351, or \"Statute of Treasons\", which distinguished between high and petty treason, several distinct offences constitute high treason; most of them continue to do so, while those relating to forgery have been relegated to ordinary offences.\nFirst, it was high treason to \"compass or imagine the death of our Lord the King, of our Lady his Queen, or of their eldest son and heir.\" The terms \"compass or imagine\" indicate the premeditation of a murder; it would not be high treason to accidentally kill the sovereign or any other member of the Royal Family (though someone could be charged with manslaughter or negligent homicide). However it has also been held to include rebelling against or trying to overthrow the monarch, as experience has shown that this normally involves the monarch's death. The terms of this provision have been held to include both male and female sovereigns, but only the spouses of male Sovereigns. It is not sufficient to merely allege that an individual is guilty of high treason because of his thoughts or imaginations; there must be an overt act indicating the plot.\n\nA second form of high treason defined by the Treason Act 1351 was having sexual intercourse with \"the King's companion, or the King's eldest daughter unmarried, or the wife of the King's eldest son and heir.\" If the intercourse is not consensual, only the rapist is liable, but if it is consensual, then both parties are liable. Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard, wives of Henry VIII, were found guilty of treason for this reason. The jurist Sir William Blackstone writes that \"the plain intention of this law is to guard the Blood Royal from any suspicion of bastardy, whereby the succession to the Crown might be rendered dubious.\" Thus, only women are covered in the statute; it is not, for example, high treason to rape a Queen-Regnant's husband. Similarly, it is not high treason to rape a widow of the sovereign or of the heir-apparent. Diana, Princess of Wales admitted that she had an affair with her riding instructor, James Hewitt, between 1987 and 1992. As she was then the wife of the Prince of Wales, heir to the throne, this fitted the definition of high treason, and a national newspaper briefly attempted to have Hewitt prosecuted for what was then still a capital offence.\n\nIt is high treason \"if a man do levy war against our Lord the King in his realm\" or \"if a man be adherent to the King's enemies in his realm, giving to them aid and comfort in the realm or elsewhere.\" Conspiracy to levy war or aid the sovereign's enemies do not amount to this kind of treason, though it may be encompassing the Sovereign's death. In modern times only these kinds of treason have actually been prosecuted (during the World Wars and the Easter Rising).\n\nThe Treason Act 1351 made it high treason to \"slay the Chancellor, Treasurer, or the King's justices of the one bench or the other, justices in eyre, or justices of assize, and all other justices assigned to hear and determine, being in their places doing their offices.\"\n\nThe last types of high treason defined by the Treason Act 1351 were the forgery of the Great Seal or Privy Seal, the counterfeiting of English (later British) money and the importing of money known to be counterfeit. These offences, however, were reduced to felonies rather than high treasons in 1861 and 1832 respectively.\n\nFinally, the Treason Act 1351 specified that the listing of offences was meant to be exhaustive. Only Parliament, not the courts, could add to the list. It provided that if \"other like cases of treason may happen in time to come, which cannot be thought of nor declared at present\", the court may refer the matter to the King and Parliament, which could then determine the matter by passage of an Act.\n\nAfter the passage of the Treason Act 1351, several other offences were deemed to comprise high treason by Act of Parliament. Parliament seemed especially unrestrained during the reign of Edward III's successor, Richard II. Numerous new offences—including intending to kill the Sovereign (even without an overt act demonstrating such intent) and killing an ambassador—were declared treasonable. Richard II, however, was deposed; his successor, Henry IV, rescinded the legislation and restored the standard of Edward III.\n\nIn 1495 Poynings' Law extended English law to cover Ireland.\n\nFrom the reign of Henry IV onwards, several new offences were made treasons; most legislation on the subject was passed during the reign of Henry VIII. It became high treason to deface money; to escape from prison whilst detained for committing treason, or to aid in an escape of a person detained for treason; to commit arson to extort money; to refer to the Sovereign offensively in public writing; to counterfeit the Sovereign's sign manual, signet or privy seal; to refuse to abjure the authority of the Pope; to marry any of the Sovereign's children, sisters, aunts, nephews or nieces without royal permission; to marry the Sovereign without disclosing prior sexual relationships; attempting to enter into a sexual relationship (out of marriage) with the Queen or a Princess; denying the Sovereign's official styles and titles; and refusing to acknowledge the Sovereign as the Supreme Head of the Church of England. Some offences, whose complexion was entirely different from traitorous actions, were nevertheless made treasons; thus, it was high treason for a Welshman to steal cattle, to commit murder by poisoning (1531), or for an assembly of twelve or more rioters to refuse to disperse when so commanded.\n\nAll new forms of high treason introduced since the Treason Act 1351, except those to do with forgery and counterfeiting, were abrogated by the Treason Act 1547, which was passed at the beginning of the reign of Edward VI. The Act created new kinds of treason however, including denying that the King was the Supreme Head of the Church, and attempting to interrupt the succession to the throne as determined by the Act of Succession 1543.\n\nWhen Mary I became queen in 1553, she passed an Act abolishing all treasons whatsoever which had been created since 1351. Later that year, however, the offence of forging the Sovereign's sign manual or signet once again became high treason. Furthermore, the anti-counterfeiting laws were extended so as to include foreign money deemed legal tender in England. Thus, it became high treason to counterfeit such foreign money, or to import counterfeit foreign money and actually attempt to use it to make a payment. (But importing any counterfeit English money remained high treason, even if no attempt were made to use it in payment.) Mary also made it high treason to kill Philip II of Spain, her king consort, or to try to deprive him of his title.\n\nWilliam III made it high treason to manufacture, buy, sell or possess instruments whose sole purpose is to coin money. He also made adding any inscription normally found on a coin to any piece of metal that may resemble a coin high treason. George II made it high treason to mark or colour a silver coin so as to make it resemble a gold one.\n\nAside from laws relating to counterfeiting and succession, very few acts concerning the definition of high treason were passed. Under laws passed during the reign of Elizabeth I, it was high treason for an individual to attempt to defend the jurisdiction of the Pope over the English Church for a third time (a first offence being a misdemeanour and a second offence a felony), or for a Roman Catholic priest to enter the realm and refuse to conform to the English Church, or to purport to release a subject of his allegiance to the Crown or the Church of England and to reconcile him or her with a foreign power. Charles II's Sedition Act 1661 made it treason to imprison, restrain or wound the king. Although this law was abolished in the United Kingdom in 1998, it still continues to apply in some Commonwealth countries. Under laws passed after James II was deposed, it became treasonable to correspond with the Jacobite claimants \"(main article)\", or to hinder succession to the Throne under the Act of Settlement 1701, or to publish that anyone other than the individual specified by the Act of Settlement had the right to inherit the Crown.\n\nIn 1708, following the Union of England and Scotland in the previous year, Queen Anne signed the Treason Act 1708, which harmonised the treason laws of both former kingdoms (effective from July 1709). The English offences of high treason and misprision of treason (but not petty treason) were extended to Scotland, and the treasonable offences then existing in Scotland were abolished. These were: \"theft in Landed Men\", murder in breach of trust, fire-raising, \"firing coalheughs\" and assassination. The Act also made it treason to counterfeit the Great Seal of Scotland, or to slay the Lords of Session or Lords of Justiciary \"sitting in Judgment in the Exercise of their Office within Scotland\".\n\nIn general, treason law in Scotland remained the same as in England, except that when in England the offence of counterfeiting the Great Seal of the United Kingdom \"etc.\" (an offence under other legislation) was reduced from treason to felony by the Forgery Act 1861, that Act did not apply to Scotland, and though in England since 1861 it has not been treason to forge the Scottish Great Seal, in Scotland this remains treason today. When the Scottish Parliament was set up in 1998, treason and treason felony were among the \"reserved matters\" it was prohibited from legislating about, ensuring that the law of treason remains uniform throughout Great Britain.\n\nBetween 1817 and 1820 it was treason to kill the Prince Regent. In 1832 counterfeiting money ceased to be treason and became a felony. In Ireland, counterfeiting seals ceased to be treason in 1861, in line with England and Wales.\n\nA notable treason trial occurred at the Old Bailey in 1916 when Sir Roger Casement was accused of collusion with Germany for his role in the Easter Rising in Ireland. The charge against him was that he tried to encourage Irish soldiers in the British Army to mutiny and fight for Germany. Casement argued that, as an Irishman, he could not be tried in an English court and should instead be tried in Ireland. This argument failed because he had worked as a diplomat for the British Government for almost all of his adult life and had accepted a knighthood and a pension from the Crown on retirement in 1911. He was hanged in Pentonville Prison on 3 August 1916, and is now often considered a martyr by the Irish Republican movement.\n\nThe Titles Deprivation Act 1917 authorised the king to deprive peers of their peerage if they had assisted the enemy during the war, or voluntarily resided in enemy territory. This was mainly in response to the closeness of the British royal family with some German thrones, leading to the loss of British titles from the dukes of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Brunswick, the Crown Prince of Hanover, and the Viscount Taaffe. Whilst the act allowed for their descendants to petition for the restoration of these titles, no descendant has done so.\n\nJohn Amery was executed in 1945 after pleading guilty to eight charges of treason for efforts to recruit British prisoners of war into the British Free Corps and for making propaganda broadcasts for Nazi Germany.\n\nThe last execution for treason in the United Kingdom was held in 1946. William Joyce (also known as Lord Haw Haw) stood accused of levying war against King George VI by travelling to Germany in the early months of World War II and taking up employment as a broadcaster of pro-Nazi propaganda to British radio audiences. He was awarded a personal commendation by Adolf Hitler in 1944 for his contribution to the German war effort. On his capture at the end of the war, Parliament rushed through the Treason Act 1945 to facilitate a trial that would have the same procedure as a trial for murder. Before the Act, a trial for treason short of regicide involved an elaborate and lengthy medieval procedure. Although Joyce was born in the United States to an Irish father and an English mother, he had moved to Britain in his teens and applied for a British passport in 1933 which was still valid when he defected to Germany and so under the law he owed allegiance to Britain. He appealed against his conviction to the House of Lords on the grounds he had lied about his country of birth on the passport application and did not owe allegiance to any country at the beginning of the war. The appeal was not upheld and he was executed at Wandsworth Prison on 3 January 1946.\n\nIt is thought the strength of public feeling against Joyce as a perceived traitor was the driving force behind his prosecution. The only evidence offered at his trial that he had begun broadcasting from Germany while his British passport was valid was the testimony of a London police inspector who had questioned him before the war while he was an active member of the British Union of Fascists and claimed to have recognised his voice on a propaganda broadcast in the early weeks of the war (he already had previous convictions for assault and riotous assembly as a result of street fights with communists and anarchists).\n\nUntil 1945 treason had its own rules of evidence and procedure which made it difficult to prosecute accused traitors, such as the need for two witnesses to the same offence. Consequently, in the Second World War it was perceived that there was a need for a new offence with which to deal with traitors more expediently. The Treachery Act 1940 was passed creating a felony called treachery, to punish disloyalty and espionage. It was a capital offence. Seventeen people were sentenced to be shot or hanged for this offence instead of for treason (one death sentence was commuted). Theodore Schurch was the last person to be put to death for treachery, in 1946. He was also the last person to be executed for a crime other than murder. Josef Jakobs, a German spy executed for treachery, was the last person to be executed in the Tower of London.\n\nThe Treachery Act 1940 was suspended in February 1946, and was repealed in 1967.\n\nIn June 1945 the Treason Act 1945 abolished the special rules of evidence and procedure formerly used in treason trials, and replaced them with the rules applicable to murder trials, to simplify the law. As discussed above, the last treason prosecutions occurred later that year.\n\nFrom 1945, treason consisted of the offences which are treason today (see above), plus two other kinds. The Succession to the Crown Act 1707 made it treason to affirm that any person has a right to succeed to the Crown otherwise than according to the Act of Settlement and Acts of Union, or that the Crown and Parliament cannot legislate for the limitation of the succession to the Crown. This was abolished in 1967. The Treason Act 1795 made it treason to \"compass, imagine, invent, devise or intend death or destruction, or any bodily harm tending to death or destruction, maim or wounding, imprisonment or restraint, of the person of ... the King.\" This was abolished in 1998, when the death penalty was also abolished.\n\nOn 26 March 2015 the Succession to the Crown Act 2013 came into effect, which amended the line of succession to the throne to give women the same right to succeed to the throne as their brothers. In consequence of this, the Treason Act 1351 was amended in two ways. Whereas it had been treason to encompass the death of the monarch's eldest \"son\" and heir, this was amended to cover an heir of either sex. It had also been treason to \"violate\" the wife of the monarch's eldest son, but the 2013 Act restricted this to cases where the eldest son is also the heir to the throne.\n\nAs a general rule, no British criminal court has jurisdiction over the Sovereign, from whom they derive their authority. As Sir William Blackstone writes, \"the law supposes an incapacity of doing wrong from the excellence and perfection ... of the King.\" Furthermore, to charge the sovereign with high treason would be inconsistent, as it would constitute accusing him of disloyalty to himself. After the English Civil War, however, Charles I was tried for treason against the people of England. His trial and execution were irregular; they were more accurately products of a revolution, rather than a legal precedent, and those responsible were themselves tried for treason after the monarchy was restored \"(see List of regicides of Charles I)\". However, a person who attempts to become the Sovereign without a valid claim can be held guilty of treason. Consequently, Lady Jane Grey was executed for treason for usurping the throne in 1553.\n\nAn alien resident in the United Kingdom owes allegiance to the Crown, and may be prosecuted for high treason. The only exception is an enemy lawful combatant in wartime, e.g. a uniformed enemy soldier on British territory.\n\nA British subject resident abroad also continues to owe allegiance to the Crown. If he or she becomes a citizen of another state before a war during which he bears arms against the Crown, he or she is not guilty of high treason. On the other hand, becoming a citizen of an enemy state during wartime is high treason, as it constitutes adhering to the sovereign's enemies.\n\nInsane individuals are not punished for their crimes. During the reign of Henry VIII, however, it was enacted that in the cases of high treason, an idiot could be tried in his absence as if he were perfectly sane. In the reign of Mary I, this statute was repealed. Today there are powers to send insane defendants to a mental hospital.\n\nThe Treason Act 1495 provides that in a civil war between two claimants to the throne, those who fight for the losing side cannot be held guilty of a crime merely for fighting against the winner.\n\nDuress is not available as a defence to treason involving the death of the sovereign.\n\nIn England and Wales and in Northern Ireland, the former defence of marital coercion was not available to a wife charged with treason.\n\nPeers and their wives and widows were formerly entitled to be tried for treason and for felonies in the House of Lords or the Court of the Lord High Steward, the former being used in every case except when Parliament was not in session. In the House of Lords, the Lord High Steward presided, but the entire House acted as both judge and jury. In the Lord High Steward's Court, the Lord High Steward was a judge, and a panel of \"Lords Triers\" served as a jury. There was no right of peremptory challenge in either body. Trial by either body ceased in 1948, since which time peers have been tried in the same courts as commoners.\n\nCommoners, and now peers and their wives and widows, are entitled to be tried for high treason, and also for lesser crimes, by jury. Formerly, commoners were entitled to thirty-five peremptory challenges in cases of treason, but only twenty in cases of felony and none in cases of misdemeanours; all peremptory challenges, however, were abolished in 1988.\n\nAnother mode of trial for treason, and also for other crimes, is in the House of Lords following impeachment by the House of Commons. Normally, the Lord Chancellor presided during trials; when a peer is accused of high treason, however, the Lord High Steward must preside. By convention, however, the Lord Chancellor would be appointed Lord High Steward for the duration of the trial—the post of Lord High Steward ceased to be regularly filled in 1421, being revived only for trials of peers and for coronations. Whilst impeachments are still possible, no impeachment has occurred since 1806.\n\nFinally, it was possible for Parliament to pass an Act of attainder, which pronounces guilt without a trial. Historically, Acts of attainder have been used against political opponents when speedy executions were desired. In 1661, Parliament passed acts posthumously attainting Oliver Cromwell, Henry Ireton and John Bradshaw—who were previously involved in Charles I's trial—of treason. These three individuals were posthumously executed, and are the only individuals to have suffered this fate posthumously under English treason laws. (In 1540, a Scottish court summoned Robert Leslie, who was deceased, for a trial for treason. The Estates-General declared the summons lawful; Leslie's body was exhumed, and his bones were presented at the bar of the court. This procedure was never used in England.)\n\nCertain special rules procedures have historically applied to high treason cases. The privilege of the peerage and parliamentary privilege preclude the arrest of certain individuals (including peers, wives and widows of peers and members of Parliament) in many cases, but treason was not included (nor were felony or breach of the peace). Similarly, an individual could not claim sanctuary when charged with high treason; this distinction between treasons and felonies was lost as sanctuary laws were repealed in the late 17th and early 19th century. The defendant, furthermore, could not claim the benefit of clergy in treason cases; but the benefit of the clergy, as well, was abolished during the 19th century.\n\nFormerly, if an individual stood mute and refused to plead guilty or not guilty for a felony, he would be tortured until he enter a plea; if he died in the course of the torture, his lands would not be seized to the Crown, and his heirs would be allowed to succeed to them. In cases of high treason, however, an individual could not save his lands by refusing to enter a plea; instead, a refusal would be punished by immediate forfeiture of all estates. This distinction between treasons and felonies ended in 1772, when the court was permitted to enter a plea on a defendant's behalf.\n\nFormerly, an individual was not entitled to assistance of counsel in any capital case, including treason; the rule, however, was abolished in treason cases by the Treason Act 1695. The same Act extended a rule from 1661 which had made it necessary to produce at least two witnesses to prove each alleged offence of high treason. Nearly one hundred years later a stricter version of this rule was incorporated into the Constitution of the United States. The 1695 Act also provided for a three-year time limit on bringing prosecutions for treason (except for assassinating the king) and misprision of treason, another rule which has been imitated in some common law countries.\n\nThese rules made it difficult to prosecute charges of treason, and the rule was relaxed by the Treason Act 1800 to make attempts on the life of the King subject to the same rules of procedure and evidence as existed in murder trials (which did not require two witnesses). This change was extended to all assaults on the Sovereign by the Treason Act 1842. Finally the special rules for treason were abolished by the Treason Act 1945 when the rules of evidence and procedure in all cases of treason were made the same as for murder. However, the original three-year time limit stated above survived into the present day. This meant that when James Hewitt was accused of treason in 1996 because of his affair with the Princess of Wales, he could not be prosecuted because it could not be proved that he had done it within the foregoing three-year period.\n\nThe procedure on trials for treason is the same as that on trials for murder. It is therefore an indictable-only offence.\n\nEngland and Wales\nOn the trial of an indictment for treason, the jury cannot return an alternative verdict to the offence charged in that indictment under section 6(3) of the Criminal Law Act 1967. For example, the jury cannot give an alternative verdict of manslaughter in cases of the assassination of the monarch. The Homicide Act 1957 does not apply. However, under the common law the jury may return a verdict of guilty of misprision of treason instead of treason.\n\nNorthern Ireland\nOn the trial of an indictment for treason, the jury cannot return an alternative verdict to the offence charged in that indictment under section 6(2) of the Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1967. For this purpose each count is considered to be a separate indictment (s.6(7)).\n\nA person may not be indicted for treason committed within the United Kingdom (subject to the following exception) unless the indictment is preferred within three years of the commission of that offence. This limitation does not apply to treason which consists of designing, endeavouring or attempting to assassinate the sovereign. There is no time limit on the prosecution of treason committed outside of the United Kingdom.\n\nIn England and Wales, a person charged with treason may not be granted bail except by order of a High Court judge or of the Secretary of State. The same rule applies in Northern Ireland.\n\nIn Scotland, all crimes and offences which are treason are bailable.\n\nThe form of execution once suffered by traitors was often (though not invariably) torturous. The condemned could not walk or be carried to the place of execution; the sentence required that they were to be drawn: they might be dragged along the ground, but were normally tied onto a hurdle which was drawn to the place of execution by a horse. A man would then be hanged by a noose around the neck, but not so as to die: there would be no \"drop\" to break the neck. Whilst still alive, he would be cut down and allowed to drop to the ground, stripped of his clothes, his genitals cut off, his viscera pulled out and burnt before his own eyes, and other organs would be torn out of his body. The body would be decapitated, and cut into four quarters. The body parts would be at the disposal of the Sovereign, and generally they would be gibbeted or publicly displayed as a warning. The body parts would be parboiled in salt and cumin seed: the salt to prevent putrefaction, and the cumin seed to prevent birds pecking at the flesh. This sentence was amended in 1814 so that the offender would hang to death; the disembowelling, beheading and quartering were to be carried out posthumously.\n\nWomen were excluded from this type of punishment and instead were drawn and then burned at the stake, until this was replaced with hanging by the Treason Act 1790 and the Treason by Women Act (Ireland) 1796.\n\nThe penalty for high treason by counterfeiting or clipping coins was the same as the penalty for petty treason (which for men was drawing and hanging without the torture and quartering, and for women was burning or hanging.)\n\nIndividuals of noble birth were not subjected to either form of torture, but merely beheaded. Even commoners' sentences were sometimes commuted to beheading—a sentence not formally removed from the British law until 1973.\n\nIn addition to being tortured and executed, a traitor was also deemed \"attainted\". The first consequence of attainder was forfeiture; all lands and estates of a traitor were forever forfeit to the Crown. A second consequence was corruption of blood; the attainted person could neither inherit property, nor transmit it to his or her descendants. This may have been open to abuse, either by avaricious monarchs or by parliament when little (if any) evidence was available to secure a conviction. There was a complex and ceremonial procedure used to try treason cases, with a strict requirement for a minimum of two witnesses to the crime.\n\nIn 1832 the death penalty was abolished for treason by forging seals and the Royal sign manual.\n\nIn 1870, attainder was abolished. In the same year in England, and in 1949 in Scotland, posthumous drawing and quartering was abolished, and so the sole punishment was hanging.\n\nBeheading was abolished in 1973, by which time it had long been obsolete.\n\nBy 1965, capital punishment had been abolished for almost all crimes, but was still mandatory (unless the offender was pardoned or the sentence commuted) for high treason until 1998. By section 36 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 the maximum punishment for high treason became life imprisonment. \"(See also Treason Act 1814.)\"\n\nThe last beheading of a peer for high treason was that of Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat in 1747. The last execution by burning for high treason was that of Catherine Murphy in 1789. The last sentences of hanging, drawing and quarterings were those on the Cato Street Conspirators in 1820, (but the drawing and quartering were omitted by royal command). One of the last executions for high treason was that of John Amery, the last person in the United Kingdom to plead guilty to high treason. The last execution of any kind for high treason was that of William Joyce by hanging in 1946.\n\nA person convicted of treason is liable to imprisonment for life or for any shorter term. A whole life tariff may be imposed for the gravest offences. (See Life imprisonment in England and Wales for more details).\n\nTreason also entails disqualification from public office, and loss of suffrage (except in local elections). This rule does not apply in Scotland.\n\nTreason (including constructive treason) is a reserved matter on which the Scottish Parliament cannot legislate.\n\nTreason (but not powers of arrest or criminal procedure) is an excepted matter on which the Northern Ireland Assembly cannot legislate.\n\nAlmost all treason-related offences introduced since the Treason Act 1351 was passed have been abolished or relegated to lesser offences. The Treason Act 1351, on the other hand, has not been significantly amended; the only changes involve the removal of counterfeiting, as explained above. For the state of the law today, see the \"Offences\" section above.\n\nIn Autumn 2001 following 9/11, the British government threatened British citizens who fought for the Taliban army in Afghanistan against Anglo-American troops with prosecution for treason, although no one was subsequently tried, at least not for treason.\n\nOn 8 August 2005, it was reported that the UK Government was considering bringing prosecutions for treason against a number of British Islamic clerics who have publicly spoken positively about acts of terrorism against civilians in Britain, or attacks on British soldiers abroad, including the 7 July London bombings and numerous attacks on troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. Following this threat one foreign cleric who the British government had failed to deport fled to Lebanon, only to request to be rescued by the British military during the 2006 Israeli-Lebanon War. However, later that year prosecutors indicted Abu Hamza al-Masri for inciting murder (he was convicted in February 2006), and it now seems unlikely that anyone will be charged with treason in the foreseeable future.\n\nIn 2008 the former attorney-general, Lord Goldsmith QC, published a report on his review of British citizenship. One of his recommendations was for a \"thorough reform and rationalisation of the law\" of treason.\n\nIn 2014 the Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond revealed that the British Government was considering high treason charges for Islamic extremists in response to growing numbers of British Jihad fighters travelling to Syria and Iraq to join the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.\n\nActs containing substantive or procedural law\n\n\nActs creating similar offences<br>\nSee also the Treason Act 1842 (assaulting the Queen), the Official Secrets Acts 1911 to 1989 (espionage), the Trading with the Enemy Act 1939 and the Terrorism Acts.\n\n\n"}

It was first established in the 2005-2010 Parliament, and was reappointed in December 2010 and December 2015. The committee comprises members from the House of Commons and members of the House of Lords.\n\nThe committee’s terms of reference are “to consider the National Security Strategy”. It has said that it does not wish to duplicate the work of other select committees, and instead intends to draw on their work. The Committee \"scrutinises the structures for Government decision-making on National Security, particularly the role of the National Security Council and the National Security Adviser.\"\n\nThe committee published its first report \"First Review of the National Security Strategy 2010\" on 8 March 2012. The report addresses the National Security Strategy, the National Security Council (and the secretariat which supports it), and the National Security Adviser. It was agreed unanimously. The committee welcomed the National Security Strategy but said that it was work in progress and needed to be improved. In a press release sent out with the report it said that:\n\n\nIt also said that the government's unwillingness to provide it with all the information it had asked for about the National Security Risk Assessment means that it was unable to give Parliament any assurances about its adequacy. The committee expressed concerns that the \"National Security Council's oversight of security issues is not sufficiently broad and strategic\", given that it was deeply involved in operations in Libya and failed to discuss the national security implications of the Eurozone crisis or the possibility of Scottish independence.\n\nThe JCNSS published the government response to its first report on 11 July 2012, along with a two-page report summarising the committee's concerns about the response. The committee said that it welcomed the government response and the government's commitment to providing it with more information in future, but said that the government had failed to:\n\nThe committee said that the government needed to start to map out its programme for the next NSS immediately.

It undertook to consult the JCNSS in confidence as the forward work programme took shape and to keep the Committee up-to-date on significant developments.\n\nThe JCNSS published this response as its First Special Report of Session 2012-13.\n\nIn February 2013 the committee published its report \"The work of the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy in 2012\". This reviewed the committee’s work over the past year and called on the government to address five key areas of concern:\n\n\nIn a press release the chair of the committee said that “the NSC should think strategically, keeping its eye on the longer term and assessing the effect of Departments’ policy proposals. We were stunned that the NSC had not discussed the implications of the major policy changes made last year by the MOD. How it can be strategic if it has not considered the impact of restructuring the Army?”\n\nThe Committee published its report into the Conflict, Stability and Security Fund (CSSF) in January 2017 after an eight-month inquiry. The report praised many of the intentions of the CSSF, but criticised its lack of transparency for the purposes of Parliamentary scrutiny. The Committee also noted that the CSSF would be better managed under the control of a single Government Minister, fearing that \"collective responsibility will degenerate into no responsibility.\"\n\nThe JCNSS announced its Cyber Security Inquiry in January 2017.\n\nAs of 6 November 2017, the membership of the committee is as follows:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40707481", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40707481", "title": "Judicial review in South Africa", "text": "Judicial review in South Africa\n\nA century ago, in \"Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Co v Johannesburg Town Council\", Innes CJ distinguished only three typesBold text of judicial review in the South African system:\n\n\nThese three forms of review still exist today, but the list has been expanded as a result of modern developments, including and most especially the Constitution. Among the latest additions are\n\n\nThe High Courts may be asked to review the proceedings of inferior courts, such as magistrates’ courts and small claims courts, on grounds set out in section 24 of the Supreme Court Act. The grounds are absence of jurisdiction, bias or corruption on the part of the presiding officer, gross irregularity in the proceedings, and the admission of inadmissible evidence.\n\nCertain statutes make provision for the decisions of magistrates or other judicial officers to be reviewed \"automatically\" by judges, meaning that the review is not initiated by an aggrieved individual but takes place by virtue of a statutory trigger. Probably the best-known example is section 302 of the Criminal Procedure Act, which provides for the automatic review by judges of certain sentences imposed by magistrates. Another example is section 19(3) of the Extension of Security of Tenure Act, which provides for the automatic review of orders of eviction granted in the magistrates’ courts.\n\nIn constitutional law \"judicial review\" usually means the power of the courts to scrutinise and declare unconstitutional any type of legislation, original or delegated, or state conduct that infringes on rights in the Bill of Rights (such as the right to equality or the right to privacy) or otherwise offends against provisions of the Constitution. As a result of the constitutionalisation of administrative law, review in the administrative-law sense is now largely a species of constitutional review.\n\nIn administrative law \"judicial review\" refers more specifically to the power of the courts to scrutinise and set aside administrative decisions or rules (delegated legislation) on the basis of certain grounds of review. In the pre-democratic era this was an inherent power of the Supreme Court and was governed by the common law. Today this type of review is regulated indirectly by section 33 of the Constitution and directly by PAJA. Thus judicial review in the administrative-law sense is now principally a statutory matter. When PAJA is not of application for whatever reason, this type of review will be governed either by other principles of the Constitution, chiefly section 1(c) (where public powers are concerned) or by the common law in the case of private powers.The point of providing for review was to make it more accessible.\n\nThe legislature may and often does confer on the courts a statutory power of review. This is \"special\" because it differs from \"ordinary\" judicial review in the administrative-law sense (as now governed by PAJA). It is sometimes a wider power than ordinary review, and thus more akin to an appeal, but it may well be narrower, with the court confined to particular grounds of review or particular remedies. While Innes CJ spoke of the statutory review power as being \"far wider\" than the first two kinds of review mentioned by him, \"it is clear that the precise extent of the power always depends on the particular statutory provision concerned.\" This was recognised by Van Heerden JA for a unanimous Supreme Court of Appeal in \"Nel NO v The Master\".\n\nThe statute book is replete with examples of special statutory review. One example is the review of decisions made in terms of the Promotion of Access to Information Act (PAIA), which takes place on grounds to be gleaned from that statute. Others are the review of a \"decision, ruling, order or taxation\" of the Master in terms of section 151 of the Insolvency Act and the provision in section 145 of the Labour Relations Act for review of arbitration awards made by the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA). The review of private (consensual) arbitration takes place in terms of section 33(1) of the Arbitration Act on grounds that overlap somewhat with those applying to the proceedings of inferior courts.\n\nThe first two types of review listed above are not of much relevance to administrative law, although there is some overlap between the grounds for reviewing the decisions of inferior courts and the grounds for reviewing the decisions of administrators. For the most part, the term \"judicial review\"—when used in the context of administrative law, and when used without qualification—means the review of administrative decisions and delegated legislation. Special statutory review is also a concern of administrative law, as it generally operates as an alternative or potential alternative to the review of administrative decisions and delegated legislation under the PAJA.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1068102", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1068102", "title": "Prior-appropriation water rights", "text": "Prior-appropriation water rights\n\nPrior appropriation water rights is the legal doctrine that the first person to take a quantity of water from a water source for \"beneficial use\" (agricultural, industrial or household) has the right to continue to use that quantity of water for that purpose.\n\nSubsequent users can take the remaining water for their own beneficial use if they do not impinge on the rights of previous users.\n\nThe doctrine developed in the Western United States and is different from riparian water rights, which are applied in the rest of the United States. Water is very scarce in the West and so must be allocated sparingly, based on the productivity of its use. The right is also allotted to those who are \"first in time of use.\"\n\nThe appropriation doctrine originated in California around the time of the Gold Rush where miners were looking for ways to increase the amount of water available for mining operations. The 1855 California Supreme Court case of \"Irwin v. Phillips\" is what brought the water appropriation problems to light. Matthew Irwin diverted a stream for his mining operation. Shortly afterward, Robert Phillips started a mining operation downstream and eventually tried to divert the water back to its original streambed. The case was taken all the way to the California Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of the appropriation law.\n\n\"Each drop of rain falling through the sky has already been allocated to a user. Leave the hose running between rinses while you wash your car and you won't run afoul of the law; but if you gather a pailful of rainwater and pour on your tomato plant, look over your shoulder for a water cop. You will be preventing those raindrops from entering the watershed, depriving people downstream from the surrounding creeks and rivers of their rights to use their apportioned amounts of streamflow. The doctrine of prior appropriation comes crashing up against the imperative to conserve scarce water. Colorado made it legal for some homeowners to harvest rain and snow from their roofs. Tucson is encouraging its citizens to gather rainwater. Santa Fe made catchment devices mandatory for new dwellings. But, in Utah and Washington (with the exception of Seattle), harvesting raindrops is still a crime.\"\n\nThe legal details vary from state to state; however, the general principle is that water rights are unconnected to land ownership, and can be sold or mortgaged like other property. These rights can be lost over time if non-use of the water source is demonstrated or if the water has not been used for a certain number of years.\n\nThere are four essential elements: intent, diversion, beneficial use, and priority. The first person to use a quantity of water from a water source for a beneficial use has the right to continue to use that quantity of water for that purpose. Subsequent users can use the remaining water for their own beneficial purposes provided that they do not impinge on the rights of previous users; this is the priority element of the doctrine. In addition to this, a user may not change the intent in which he is appropriating water such that the change hinders the use by another. These \"Preservation of Conditions\" were granted to the second user after \"Farmers High Line v. City of Golden\" (CO 1954).\n\nBeneficial use is commonly defined as agricultural, industrial or household use. Ecological purposes, such as maintaining a natural body of water and the wildlife that depends on it, were not initially deemed as beneficial uses in some Western states but have been accepted in some jurisdictions. The extent to which private parties may own such rights varies among the states.\n\nEach water right has a yearly quantity and an appropriation date. Each year, the user with the earliest appropriation date (known as the \"senior appropriator\") may use up to their full allocation (provided the water source can supply it). Then the user with the next earliest appropriation date may use their full allocation and so on. In times of drought, users with junior appropriation dates might not receive their full allocation or even any water at all.\n\nWhen a water right is sold, it retains its original appropriation date. Only the amount of water historically consumed can be transferred if a water right is sold. For example, if alfalfa is grown, using flood irrigation, the amount of the return flow may not be transferred, only the amount that would be necessary to irrigate the amount of alfalfa historically grown. If a water right is not used for a beneficial purpose for a period of time it may lapse under the doctrine of abandonment. Abandonment of a water right is rare, but occurred in Colorado in a case involving the South Fork of San Isabel Creek in Saguache County, Colorado.\n\nFor water sources with many users, a government or quasi-government agency is usually charged with overseeing allocations. Allocations involving water sources that cross state borders or international borders can be quite contentious, and are generally governed by federal court rulings, interstate agreements and international treaties.\n\nEven though water markets are increasingly gaining ground, many have criticized the prior appropriation system for failing to adequately adjust to society's evolving values. For example, the vast majority of water in the West still is allocated to agricultural uses despite the cries for additional water from growing cities. Additionally, the high demand for the allocation of water can cause an over-appropriation of the waters. This means that there are more water rights for that particular stream than there is water actually available. For example, in Nevada, approximately 45 basins are over-appropriated. Similarly, environmentalists and those who use rivers for recreational and/or scenic purposes have demanded that more water be left in rivers in streams. The prior appropriation system has in many ways inhibited these calls for change.\n\nAlaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, Wyoming all use the prior appropriation doctrine, with permitting and reporting as their regulatory system.\n\nCalifornia and Texas recognize a dual doctrine system that employs both riparian and prior appropriation rights. Oregon mainly uses the prior appropriation doctrine with some remnants of the riparian doctrine. Landowners have rights to water on their own land at a certain time at which it is then incorporated into the appropriation system.\n\nIn these cases, riparian rights take precedence, unless they are not claimed by a certain date or are not used within a certain number of years.\n\nArizona adopted the prior appropriation doctrine such that a person could acquire this water right simply by applying it to beneficial use and posting an appropriation notice at the point of diversion. On June 12, 1919, they enacted the Public Water Code in which the person must apply for and obtain a permit for water use.\n\nThe appropriation doctrine was adopted in Colorado in 1872 when the territorial court ruled in \"Yunker v. Nichols\", 1 Colo. 552 (1872), that a non-riparian user who had previously applied part of the water from a stream to beneficial use had superior rights to the water with respect to a riparian owner who claimed a right to use of all the water at a later time. The question was not squarely presented again to the Colorado Court until 1882 when in the landmark case, \"Coffin v. Left Hand Ditch Co.\", 6 Colo. 443 (1882), the court explicitly adopted the appropriation doctrine and rejected the riparian doctrine, citing Colorado irrigation and mining practices and the nature of the climate. The decision in \"Coffin\" ruled that prior to adoption of the appropriation doctrine in the Colorado Constitution of 1876 that the riparian doctrine had never been the law in Colorado. Within 20 years the appropriation doctrine, the so-called Colorado Doctrine, had been adopted, in whole or part, by most of the states in the Western United States that had an arid climate.\n\nNew Mexico enacted its appropriate Surface-Water Code in 1907. Later, in 1931, New Mexico enacted the Underground Water Law that adapted the state's surface law to ground water.\n\nThe prior-appropriation doctrine was adopted in 1973 in Montana under the 1973 Water Use Act. Later, they then passed the Montana Ground Water Assessment Act in 1991.\n\nIn 1967, Texas passed the Water Rights Adjudication Act in regards to surface waters such that the allocation of these waters was under a unified permit system.\n\nWater is not the only public good that has been subject to prior appropriation. The same \"first in time, first in right\" theory has been used in the United States to encourage and give a legal framework for other commercial activities.\n\nThe early prospectors and miners in the California Gold Rush of 1849, and later gold and silver rushes in the western United States, applied appropriation theory to mineral deposits. The first one to discover and begin mining a deposit was acknowledged to have a legal right to mine. Because appropriation theory in mineral lands and water rights developed in the same time and place, it is likely that they influenced one another. This was seen in the California case \"Irwin v. Phillips\", 5 Cal. 140 (1855) which decided a water rights dispute between two non-riparian miners on the basis of \"first in time, first in right\", a maxim drawn from equity. As with water rights, mining rights could be forfeited by nonuse. The miners codes were later legalized by the federal government in 1866, and then in the Mining Law of 1872.\n\nThe Homestead Act of 1862 granted legal title to the first farmer to put public land into agricultural production. This \"first in time\" right to agricultural land may have been influenced by appropriation theory applied to mineral lands.\n\nIn recent years, there has been some discussion of limiting air pollution by granting rights to existing pollution sources. Then it has been argued, a free cap and trade market could develop in pollution rights. This would be prior appropriation theory applied to air pollution. Recent concern over carbon dioxide and global warming has led to an economic market in CO emissions, in which some companies wish to balance emissions increases by offsetting decreases in existing emissions sources. This is essentially acknowledging a prior appropriation right to existing CO emitters.\n\n\n"}

In the United Kingdom and its colonies reformatories were set up from 1830 onwards for youngsters who were convicted of a crime as an alternative to an adult prison. In parallel, \"Industrial schools\" were set up for vagrants and children needing protection. Both were 'certified' by the government from 1850, and in 1930 the systems merged and both were 'approved' and became approved schools. They were distinct from borstals (1902-1982 UK), which were enclosed juvenile prisons.\n\nSocial reformers in America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries almost invariably found fault with the then-usual practice of treating juvenile offenders essentially the same as adult criminals. It was recognized that the juveniles were often sexually and otherwise exploited by the older inmates and that they were often receiving instruction in more advanced and serious ways of crime by hardened criminals with little regard for law, society's morals, or even human life. As a result, rather than their sentences serving as a deterrent to future crimes, many juvenile offenders emerged from incarceration far worse than when they were first sentenced.\n\nThe reforms, which were adopted far more readily in some states than others, consisted of a two-pronged approach: a separate juvenile code and juvenile courts for offenders who had not reached the age of majority, and the building of separate institutions for juvenile \"delinquents\" (the stigmatizing term \"criminal\" not being used). Because the primary purpose of these institutions was to be rehabilitative rather than punitive, they were styled \"reform schools\". For the most part, these institutions were custodial.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, reformatory schools were provided for criminal children whilst industrial schools were intended to prevent vulnerable children becoming criminal. There was a perceived rise in juvenile delinquency in the early 19th century; whereas in a rural economy very young children could gain paid employment doing tasks such as bird scaring and stone gathering these opportunities were not available in the cities. Youngsters were very visible on the streets. In 1816, Parliament set up a ‘Committee for Investigating the Alarming Increase in Juvenile Crime in the Metropolis’, in 1837 the writer Charles Dickens published Oliver Twist a story about a child involved in a street gang. and in 1847 it was recognised in the Juvenile Offences Act of 1847, that children under 14 should be tried in a special court not an adult court. Begging and vagrancy was rife, and it was these low level misdemeanours that caused the magistrates to send vulnerable youngsters to industrial schools to learn to be industrious, and learn skills that would make then more employable.\n\nMore serious crimes, required an element of punishment in an environment away from older prisoners followed by education to reform their ways. The power to set up such an establishment was given in the 1854 Youthful Offenders Act (the Reformatory Schools Act). This provided financial assistance and support for reformatory schools as an alternative to prison. Industrial schools were regularised three years later by the 1857 Industrial schools act.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, many of the same problems that had occurred with the former system of incarcerating juveniles along with adults began to be noticed in reform school—older juveniles exploiting the younger ones, sexually and otherwise, and the younger ones taking the more hardened, usually older offenders as role models and mentors. Also, the term \"reform school\" itself, originally intended as destigmatizing, had developed its own stigma.\n\nToday, no state openly or officially refers to its juvenile correctional institutions as \"reform schools\", although such institutions still exist. The attempt has also been made to reduce the population of such institutions to the maximum extent possible, and to leave all but the most incorrigible youths in a home setting. Also, in an attempt to make the situation more socially normal, and in response to the rising number of young female offenders, many such institutions have been made coeducational.\n\nThe current approach involves minimizing the use of custodial institutions and the maximization of the use of less-restrictive settings which allow the youths to remain in their own homes, usually while attending during the daytime an institution called an alternative school or something similar, which is usually a more-structured version of a public school. There may be court-monitored probation or other restrictions, such as a strict curfew applied to the clientele of the \"Department of Youth Services\" or whatever the state terms it, than for other youths the same age.\n\nIn the United States, the most well-known facilities meeting the general criteria for being colloquially labelled \"reform schools\" include the Lincoln Hills School near Merrill, Wisconsin (mentioned in episodes of the once-popular TV series \"Picket Fences\") and the Preston School of Industry in Ione, California. The first publicly funded reform school in the United States was the State Reform School for Boys in Westborough, Massachusetts. It opened in 1848.\n\nIn Denmark, continuation high schools continue to be used as reform schools as they are much cheaper than youth detention centers, while the success rates are much the same. Today, there are no national guidelines regarding the severity of the crimes with which the children are charged; nor are there any guidelines in place to assist in the decision to send them to reform school in the first place, since each town or jurisdiction has its own bylaws and budgets. Children charged with making bomb threats end up in such places.\n\n"}

{"id": "26354", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26354", "title": "Ronald Coase", "text": "Ronald Coase\n\nRonald Harry Coase (; 29 December 1910 – 2 September 2013) was a British economist and author. He was the Clifton R. Musser Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago Law School, where he arrived in 1964 and remained for the rest of his life. He received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1991.\n\nCoase, who believed economists should study real markets and not theoretical ones, established the case for the corporation as a means to pay the costs of operating a marketplace. Coase is best known for two articles in particular: \"The Nature of the Firm\" (1937), which introduces the concept of transaction costs to explain the nature and limits of firms; and \"The Problem of Social Cost\" (1960), which suggests that well-defined property rights could overcome the problems of externalities (see Coase theorem). Additionally, Coase's transaction costs approach is currently influential in modern organizational economics, where it was reintroduced by Oliver E. Williamson.\n\nRonald Harry Coase was born in Willesden, a suburb of London, on 29 December 1910. His father, Henry Joseph Coase (1884–1973) was a telegraphist for the post office, as was his mother, Rosalie Elizabeth Coase (née Giles; 1882–1972), before marriage. As a child, Coase had a weakness in his legs, for which he was required to wear leg-irons. Due to this problem, he attended the school for physical defectives. At the age of 12, he was able to enter the Kilburn Grammar School on scholarship. At Kilburn, he studied for the intermediate examination of the University of London as an external student in 1927–29. Coase married Marion Ruth Hartung of Chicago, Illinois in Willesden, England, 7 August 1937. Although they were unable to have children, they were married 75 years until her death in 2012, making him one of the longest-married Nobel Prize laureates.\n\nCoase attended the London School of Economics, where he took courses with Arnold Plant and received a bachelor of commerce degree in 1932. During his undergraduate studies, Coase received the Sir Ernest Cassel Travelling Scholarship, awarded by the University of London. He used this to visit the University of Chicago in 1931–1932 and studied with Frank Knight and Jacob Viner. Coase's colleagues would later admit that they did not remember this first visit. Between 1932–34, Coase was an assistant lecturer at the Dundee School of Economics and Commerce, which later became part of the University of Dundee. Subsequently, Coase was an assistant lecturer in commerce at the University of Liverpool between 1934–1935 before returning to London School of Economics as a member of staff until 1951. He then started to work at the University at Buffalo and retained his British citizenship after moving to the United States in the 1950s. In 1958, he moved to the University of Virginia. Coase settled at the University of Chicago in 1964 and became the editor of the \"Journal of Law and Economics\". He was also for a time a trustee of the Philadelphia Society. He received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1991.\n\nNearing his 100th birthday, Coase was working on a book concerning the rise of the economies of China and Vietnam. In an interview, Coase explained the mission of the Coase China Society and his vision of economics and the part to be played by Chinese economists. Coase was honoured and received an honorary doctorate from the University at Buffalo Department of Economics in May 2012.\n\nCoase died in Chicago on 2 September 2013 at the age of 102. His wife had died on 17 October 2012. He was praised across the political spectrum, with Slate Magazine calling him \"one of the most distinguished economists in the world\" and \"Forbes\" magazine calling him \"the greatest of the many great University of Chicago economists\". The Washington Post called his work over eight decades \"impossible to summarize\" while recommending five of his papers to read.\n\nIn \"The Nature of the Firm\" (1937), a brief but highly influential essay, Coase attempts to explain why the economy features a number of business firms instead of consisting exclusively of a multitude of independent, self-employed people who contract with one another. Given that \"production could be carried on without any organization [that is, firms] at all\", Coase asks, why and under what conditions should we expect firms to emerge?\n\nSince modern firms can only emerge when an entrepreneur of some sort begins to hire people, Coase's analysis proceeds by considering the conditions under which it makes sense for an entrepreneur to seek hired help instead of contracting out for some particular task.\n\nThe traditional economic theory of the time (in the tradition of Adam Smith) suggested that, because the market is \"efficient\" (that is, those who are best at providing each good or service most cheaply are already doing so), it should always be cheaper to contract out than to hire.\n\nCoase noted, however, a number of transaction costs involved in using the market; the cost of obtaining a good or service via the market actually exceeds the price of the good. Other costs, including search and information costs, bargaining costs, keeping trade secrets, and policing and enforcement costs, can all potentially add to the cost of procuring something from another party. This suggests that firms will arise which can internalise the production of goods and services required to deliver a product, thus avoiding these costs. This argument sets the stage for the later contributions by Oliver Williamson: markets and hierarchies are alternative co-ordination mechanisms for economic transactions.\n\nThere is a natural limit to what a firm can produce internally, however. Coase notices \"decreasing returns to the entrepreneur function\", including increasing overhead costs and increasing propensity for an overwhelmed manager to make mistakes in resource allocation. These factors become countervailing costs to the use of the firm.\n\nCoase argues that the size of a firm (as measured by how many contractual relations are \"internal\" to the firm and how many \"external\") is a result of finding an optimal balance between the competing tendencies of the costs outlined above. In general, making the firm larger will initially be advantageous, but the decreasing returns indicated above will eventually kick in, preventing the firm from growing indefinitely.\n\nOther things being equal, therefore, a firm will tend to be larger:\n\nThe first two costs will increase with the spatial distribution of the transactions organised and the dissimilarity of the transactions. This explains why firms tend to either be in different geographic locations or to perform different functions. Additionally, technology changes that mitigate the cost of organising transactions across space may allow firms to become larger – the advent of the telephone and of cheap air travel, for example, would be expected to increase the size of firms.\n\nUpon publishing his article The Federal Communications Commission in 1959, Coase received negative feedback from the faculty at the University of Chicago over his conclusions and apparent conflicts with A. C. Pigou. According to Coase, \"What I said was thought to run counter to Pigou's analysis by a number of economists at the University of Chicago and was therefore, according to them, wrong. At a meeting in Chicago I was able to convince these economists that I was right and Pigou's analysis faulty.\" Coase had presented his paper in 1960 during a seminar in Chicago, to twenty senior economist including George Stigler and Milton Friedman. He gradually won over the usually skeptic audience, in what has later been considered a \"paradigm-shifting moment\" in the genesis of Chicago Law and Economics. Coase would join the Chicago faculty four years later.\n\nPublished in the \"Journal of Law and Economics\" in 1960, while Coase was a member of the Economics department at the University of Virginia, \"The Problem of Social Cost\" provided the key insight that it is unclear where the blame for externalities lies. The example he gave was of a rancher whose cattle stray onto the cropland of his neighbour. If the rancher is made to restrict his cattle, he is harmed just as the farmer is if the cattle remain unrestrained.\n\nCoase argued that without transaction costs the initial assignment of property rights makes no difference to whether or not the farmer and rancher can achieve the economically efficient outcome. If the cost of restraining cattle by, say, building a fence, is less than the cost of crop damage, the fence will be built. The initial assignment of property rights determines who builds the fence. If the farmer is responsible for the crop damage, the farmer will pay for the fence (as long the fence costs less than the crop damage). The allocation of property rights is primarily an equity issue, with consequences for the distribution of income and wealth, rather than an efficiency issue.\n\nWith sufficient transaction costs, initial property rights matter for both equity and efficiency. From the point of view of economic efficiency, property rights should be assigned such that the owner of the rights wants to take the economically efficient action. To elaborate, if it is efficient not to restrict the cattle, the rancher should be given the rights (so that cattle can move about freely), whereas if it is efficient to restrict the cattle, the farmer should be given the rights over the movement of the cattle (so the cattle are restricted).\n\nThis seminal argument forms the basis of the famous Coase theorem as labelled by Stigler.\n\nThough trained as an economist, Coase spent much of his career working in a law school. He is a central figure in the development of the subfield of law and economics. He viewed law and economics as having two parts, the first \"using the economists' approach and concepts to analyze the working of the legal system, often called the economic analysis of the law\"; and the second \"a study of the influence of the legal system on the working of the economic system.\" Coase said that the second part \"is the part of law and economics in which I am most interested.\"\n\nIn his Simons Lecture celebrating the centennial of the University of Chicago, titled \"Law and Economics at Chicago\", Coase noted that he only accidentally wandered into the field:\n\nDespite wandering accidentally into law and economics, the opportunity to edit the Journal of Law and Economics was instrumental in bringing him to the University of Chicago:\n\nCoase believed that the University of Chicago was the intellectual center of law and economics. He concluded his Simons lecture by stating:\n\nI am very much aware that, in concentrating in this lecture on law and economics at Chicago, I have neglected other significant contributions to the subject made elsewhere such as those by Guido Calabresi at Yale, by Donald Turner at Harvard, and by others. But it can hardly be denied that in the emergence of the subject of law and economics, Chicago has played a very significant part and one of which the University can be proud.\n\nAnother important contribution of Coase is the Coase conjecture, which states that an informal argument that durable-goods monopolists do not have market power because they are unable to commit to not lowering their prices in future periods.\n\nWhen asked what he considered his politics to be, Coase stated,\n\nI really don't know. I don't reject any policy without considering what its results are. If someone says there's going to be regulation, I don't say that regulation will be bad. Let's see. What we discover is that most regulation does produce, or has produced in recent times, a worse result. But I wouldn't like to say that all regulation would have this effect because one can think of circumstances in which it doesn't.\n\nCoase admitted that early in life, he aligned himself with socialism.\n\nGuido Calabresi wrote that Coase's focus on transaction costs in \"The Nature of the Firm\" was the result of his socialist beliefs. Reflecting on this, Coase wrote: \"It is very difficult to know where one's ideas come from but for all I know he may well be right.\" Coase continued:\n\nCoase was research advisor to the Ronald Coase Institute, an organisation that promotes research on institutions and organizations – the laws, rules, customs, and norms – that govern real economic systems, with particular support for young scholars from developing and transitional countries.\n\nThe University of Chicago Law School carries on the legacy of Ronald Coase through the mission of the Coase-Sandor Institute for Law and Economics. Each year, the University of Chicago Law School hosts the Coase Lecture, which was delivered in 2003 by Ronald Coase himself.\n\n\n\n"}

The uncertainty between the parties lies in the facts. Hence, a special referee is an expert in the factual topic, whether it be shipping, civil engineering, accounting, etc. He or she hears evidence and makes factual findings which bind the parties. This will usually be sufficient for the parties to resolve the dispute since the law can now be applied. If the parties still cannot agree, they may initiate proceedings for arbitration or litigation but, on an inter partes basis, the facts are conclusively determined by the judgment of the special referee and only questions of law may be argued before the new forum. Thus, the use of a special referee provides a relatively swift and cost-effective mechanism for dispute resolution if only because the procedure is less formal than in a court and the referee's existing expertise reduces the need to continually explain complex technical and factual matters to a judge who has only legal expertise.\n\nThe parties may anticipate the possibility of a dispute and nominate a special referee as the most appropriate form of dispute resolution (see forum selection clause). Such clauses cannot limit or deny the right of either party to refer the matter to a court (whether in the state nominated or, if the contract does not specify a state, in any court prepared to accept jurisdiction subject to the rules on forum shopping).\n\nIf there is no anticipatory provision in the contract, the parties may, of their own initiative, seek out a person qualified to act as a special referee and submit the factual case to him or her for resolution. Although costs will be involved in legal representation, fees to witnesses, and in the fee to the special referee, the expenditure will be a fraction of the costs of full-scale litigation.\n\nIf there is no agreement between the parties, the civil procedure of many states allows the court to refer the matter to a special referee when this will both provide exertise on the facts, and enable the legal case to be disposed of in a more timely fashion. For example, in Canada, the Arbitration Act provides:\n\nAs with most legal terminology, there is some variation by jurisdiction in the precise nomenclature used: in some jurisdictions a special referee is known as a \"master\", \"special master\" or \"auditor\". \n"}
{"id": "38794736", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38794736", "title": "State socialism", "text": "State socialism\n\nState socialism is a classification for any socialist political and economic perspective advocating state ownership of the means of production either as a temporary measure in the transition from capitalism to socialism, or as characteristic of socialism itself. It is often used interchangeably with state capitalism in reference to the economic systems of Marxist–Leninist states such as the Soviet Union to highlight the role of state planning in these economies, with the critics of said system referring to it more commonly as \"state capitalism\". Libertarian and democratic socialists claim that these states had only a limited number of socialist characteristics. However, Marxist–Leninists maintain that workers in the Soviet Union and other Marxist–Leninist states had genuine control over the means of production through institutions such as trade unions.\n\nState socialism is held in contrast with libertarian socialism, which rejects the view that socialism can be constructed by using existing state institutions or by governmental policies. By contrast, proponents of state socialism claim that the state—through practical considerations of governing—must play at least a temporary part in building socialism. It is possible to conceive of a democratic state that owns the means of production, but it is internally organized in a participatory, cooperative fashion, thereby achieving both social ownership of productive property and workplace democracy in day-to-day operations.\n\nThe philosophy of state socialism was first explicitly expounded by Ferdinand Lassalle. In contrast to Karl Marx's perspective, Lassalle rejected the concept of the state as a class-based power structure whose main function was to preserve existing class structures, therefore Lassalle also rejected the Marxist view that the state was destined to \"wither away\". Lassalle considered the state to be an entity independent of class allegiances and as an instrument of justice that would therefore be essential for the achievement of socialism.\n\nEarly concepts of state socialism were articulated by anarchist and libertarian philosophers who opposed the concept of the state. In \"Statism and Anarchy\", Mikhail Bakunin identified a statist tendency within the Marxist movement, which he contrasted to anarchist socialism and attributed to Marx’s philosophy. Bakunin predicted that Marx’s theory of transition from capitalism to socialism involving the working class seizing state power in a dictatorship of the proletariat would eventually lead to an usurpation of power by the state apparatus acting in its own self-interest, ushering in a new form of capitalism rather than establishing socialism.\n\nAs a political ideology, state socialism rose to prominence during the 20th century Bolshevik, Leninist and later Marxist–Leninist revolutions where single-party control over the state and by extension over the political and economic spheres of society was justified as a means to safeguard the revolution against counter-revolutionary insurrection and foreign invasion. The Stalinist theory of socialism in one country was an attempt to legitimize state-directed activity in an effort to accelerate the industrialisation of the Soviet Union.\n\nAs a political ideology, state socialism is one of the major dividing lines in the broader socialist movement. It is often contrasted non-state or anti-state forms of socialism, such as those that advocate direct self-management, adhocracy and direct cooperative ownership and management of the means of production. Political philosophies contrasted to state socialism include libertarian socialism, anarchist socialism, anarcho-communism, syndicalism, free market socialism, De Leonism and economic democracy. These forms of socialism are opposed to hierarchical technocratic socialism, scientific management and state-directed economic planning.\n\nThe modern concept of state socialism, when used in reference to Soviet-style economic and political systems, emerged from a deviation in Marxist theory starting with Vladimir Lenin. In Marxist theory, socialism is projected to emerge in the most developed capitalist economies where capitalism suffers the greatest amount of internal contradictions and class conflict. On the other hand, \"state socialism\" became a revolutionary theory for the poorest, often quasi-feudal, countries of the world. In such systems, the state apparatus is used as an instrument of capital accumulation, forcibly extracting surplus from the working class and peasantry for the purposes of modernizing and industrializing poor countries. Such systems are described as state capitalism because the state engages in capital accumulation. However, there is a clear difference between those two concepts. In state socialism, the state as a public entity engages in this activity in order to achieve socialism by re-investing the accumulated capital into the society whether be in more healthcare, education, employment or consumer goods, whereas in capitalist societies the surplus extracted from the working class is spent in whatever needs the owners of the means of production wants.\n\nIn the traditional view of socialism, thinkers including Fredrick Engels and Saint-Simon took the position that the state will change in nature in a socialist society, with the function of the state changing from one of \"political rule\" over people into a scientific administration of the processes of production. Specifically, the state would become a coordinating economic entity consisting of interdependent inclusive associations rather than a mechanism of class and political control and in the process it would cease to be a state in the traditional definition. In Marxist theory, socialism would eventually give way to a stateless communist society.\n\nPreceding the Bolshevik-led revolution in Russia, many socialist groups including reformists, orthodox Marxist currents such as council communism and the Mensheviks, anarchists and libertarian socialists criticised the idea of using the state to conduct central planning and nationalization of the means of production as a way to establish socialism.\n\nState socialism was traditionally advocated as a means for achieving public ownership of the means of production through nationalization of industry. This was intended to be a transitional phase in the process of building a socialist economy. The goals of nationalization were to dispossess large capitalists and consolidate industry so that profit would go toward public finance rather than private fortune. Nationalization would be the first step in a long-term process of socializing production: introducing employee management and reorganizing production to directly produce for use rather than profit.\n\nTraditional social democrats and non-revolutionary democratic socialists argued for a gradual, peaceful transition from capitalism to socialism. They wish to neutralize or to abolish capitalism, respectively, but through political reform rather than revolution. This method of gradualism implies utilization of the existing state apparatus and machinery of government to gradually move society toward socialism and is sometimes derided by other socialists as a form of \"socialism from above\" or political \"elitism\" for relying on electoral means to achieve socialism.\n\nIn contrast, Marxist socialism and revolutionary socialism holds that a socialist revolution is the only practical way to implement fundamental changes in the structure of society. Socialists who advocate representative democracy believe that after a certain period of time under socialism the state will \"wither away\" because class distinctions cease to exist and representative democracy would be replaced by direct democracy in the remaining public associations comprising the former state. Political power would be decentralized and distributed evenly among the population, producing a communist society.\n\nThe economic model adopted in the former Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and other Communist states is often described as a form of state socialism. The ideological basis for this system was the Marxist–Leninist theory of socialism in one country. The system that emerged in the 1930s in the Soviet Union was based on state ownership of the means of production and centralized planning, along with bureaucratic management of the workplace by state officials that were ultimately subordinate to the all-encompassing communist party. Rather than the producers controlling and managing production, the party controlled both the government machinery which directed the national economy on behalf of the communist party, and planned the production and distribution of capital goods.\n\nBecause of this, classical and orthodox Marxists as well as Trotskyist groups denounced the \"Communist\" states as being Stalinist and their economies as being state capitalist or representing degenerated workers' states, respectively.\n\nTrotskyism argues that the leadership of the Communist states was corrupt and that it abandoned Marxism in all but name. In particular, some Trotskyist schools call those countries degenerated workers' states to contrast them with proper socialism (i.e. workers' states), while other Trotskyist schools call them state capitalist to emphasise the lack of true socialism and presence of defining capitalist characteristics (wage labor, commodity production and bureaucratic control over workers).\n\nOtto von Bismarck implemented a set of social programs between 1883–1889 following his anti-socialist laws, partly as remedial measures to appease the working class and detract support for the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). Bismarck's biographer A. J. P. Taylor said: \"It would be unfair to say that Bismarck took up social welfare solely to weaken the Social Democrats; he had had it in mind for a long time, and believed in it deeply. But as usual he acted on his beliefs at the exact moment when they served a practical need\". When a reference was made to his friendship with Ferdinand Lassalle (a nationalist and state-oriented socialist), Bismarck said that he was a more practical \"socialist\" than the Social Democrats. These policies were informally referred to as \"State Socialism\" by liberal and conservative opponents and the term was later adopted by supporters of the programs in a further attempt to detract the working class from the SPD, with the goal of making the working class content with a nationalist-oriented capitalist welfare state.\n\nOtto von Bismarck made the following statement on his social welfare programs: Whoever has pensions for his old age is far more easier to handle than one who has no such prospect. Look at the difference between a private servant in the chancellery or at court; the latter will put up with much more, because he has a pension to look forward to.\n\nMany libertarian socialists, syndicalists, mutualists and anarchists go further in their critique, deriding even Marxism as state socialism for its support of a temporary, proletarian state instead of abolishing the state apparatus outright. They use the term in contrast with their own form of socialism, which involves either collective ownership (in the form of worker cooperatives) or common ownership of the means of production without state economic planning. Libertarian socialists and anarchists believe there is no need for a state in a socialist system because there would be no class to suppress and no need for an institution based on coercion and thus regard the state being a remnant of capitalism. Most also hold that statism is itself antithetical to true socialism, the goal of which is the eyes of libertarian socialists such as William Morris: \"To destroy the state and put free society in its place\".\n\nState socialism is often referred to by detractors simply as \"socialism\". For example, Austrian economists such as Ludwig Von Mises and Friedrich Hayek continually used the word \"socialism\" as a synonym for state socialism and central planning. The attributive \"state\" is usually added by socialists with a non-state based method for achieving socialism to criticize state socialism. Anarcho-syndicalists and following on from Tony Cliff, many Troskyists, deny that it even is socialism, calling it instead \"state capitalism\". Those socialists who oppose any system of state control whatsoever believe in a more decentralized approach which puts the means of production directly into the hands of the workers rather than indirectly through state bureaucracies—which they claim represent a new elite.\n\nTrotskyists believe that central planners, regardless of their intellectual capacity, operate without the input and participation of the millions of people who participate in the economy who understand/respond to local conditions and changes in the economy, and because of this criticize central state planning as being unable to effectively coordinate all economic activity.\n\nOrthodox Marxists view state socialism as an oxymoron. While an association for managing production and economic affairs would exist in socialism, it would no longer be a state in the Marxist definition (which is based on domination by one class). This leads some socialists to consider \"state socialism\" a form of state capitalism (an economy based on wage labor and capital accumulation, but with the state owning the means of production), which Engels states would be the final form of capitalism.\n\nToday, many political parties on the political center-left advocate a mild version of what may be considered \"mixed economies\" or \"regulated capitalism\" in the form of modern social democracy, in which regulation is used in place of ownership. These social reformers do not advocate the overthrow of capitalism in a social revolution and they support the continuing existence of the government, private property and the capitalist economic system, only turned to more social purposes. Modern social democracy can also be considered \"state capitalism\" because the means of production are almost universally the private property of business owners and production for voluntary exchange is carried out rather than production for use.\n"}

New York Yankees, 346 U.S. 356 (1953), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court upheld, 7–2, the antitrust exemption first granted to Major League Baseball (MLB) three decades earlier in \"Federal Baseball Club v. National League\". It was also the first challenge to the reserve clause which prevented free agency, and one of the first cases heard and decided by the Warren Court.\n\nSince it presumed that Congress's failure to act in the years since \"Federal Baseball Club\" was an implicit expression of intent to keep baseball exempt from the Sherman Antitrust Act, it has been read as having done more to create that exemption than the older case. Two justices (Stanley Forman Reed and Harold Hitz Burton) dissented from the short, unsigned \"per curiam\" majority opinion, arguing MLB and its revenue sources had changed enough since 1922 that the logic of that case no longer applied. In 1972, a third justice (William O. Douglas) would express his regret at having joined the majority when \"Toolson\" was again upheld in the similar \"Flood v. Kuhn\".\n\nGeorge Earl Toolson was a pitcher with the Newark Bears in 1949, a farm team for the New York Yankees in the AAA-class International League. He believed he was good enough to play in the major leagues, if not for the Yankees then for another team. But due to the reserve clause in his and every other player's contract, under which teams reserved rights to a player for a year after the contract expired, he was effectively bound to the talent-rich Yankees and could not negotiate a new contract with another team.\n\nWhen the Newark franchise was dissolved prior to the 1950 season, he was demoted by the Yankees' organization to the Binghamton Triplets, an A-class team within its minor league system. He refused to report and instead filed suit, arguing the reserve clause was a restraint of trade and that baseball should not be exempt from antitrust laws.\n\nIn 1922, in an opinion by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., a unanimous court held in \"Federal Baseball Club\" that professional baseball did not meet the definition of interstate commerce under the Constitution and the Sherman Act because, although teams traveled between states from game to game, that travel was \"incidental\" to the business and not an essential aspect, since all the revenue was generated from the actual games.\n\nBy the time Toolson filed his suit, baseball had grown greatly in popularity and as such had changed. Improved roads and public transportation meant that fans in some areas crossed state lines to attend games, and radio and television broadcasts, from which the teams derived substantial revenue, brought those games to the fans who did not leave home. The interstate aspects of the professional game had greatly increased.\n\nIn 1947, Commissioner of Baseball Happy Chandler was sued by former New York Giants outfielder Danny Gardella, who argued that the five-year ban Chandler imposed on players who, like Gardella, had jumped briefly to the rival Mexican League was an unfair use of monopoly power and that the \"Federal Baseball Club\" decision no longer applied. A preliminary ruling in favor of the baseball commissioner was reversed by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, returning the case to the lower court for trial. In 1949, Chandler settled with Gardella for a reported $65,000. Gardella initially sought $300,000, settling for less on his lawyers' advice he would lose on appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nIn 1951, Brooklyn congressman Emanuel Celler, an advocate for strong antitrust enforcement, had chaired a special Judiciary Committee subcommittee on monopoly power, which had looked into baseball, among other things. It had been strongly critical, but took no action because of the pending court cases from other Mexican League players.\n\nBoth the district court in Los Angeles and the Ninth Circuit relied on \"Federal Baseball Club\" in ruling for the defendants. The Supreme Court granted \"certiorari\" to hear it and consider a number of other cases by former Mexican League players pending at the appellate level.\n\nAmong the lawyers working on the case for baseball was Bowie Kuhn, then of the prestigious firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher, who would later himself become baseball commissioner and the respondent in \"Flood v. Kuhn\", the next case to challenge the reserve clause. When the case reached the Supreme Court, the Boston Red Sox filed an \"amicus curiae\" brief in support of the Yankees, their bitter rival. Since the Second Circuit, in reinstating Gardella's challenge, had called \"Federal Baseball\" \"an impotent zombi\" in light of recent Supreme Court antitrust decisions, baseball did not expect the Court to rule in its favor.\n\nA one-paragraph unsigned \"per curiam\" opinion was followed by a longer dissent by Justice Harold Hitz Burton, joined by Stanley Forman Reed.\n\nAfter briefly restating the conclusion of \"Federal Baseball Club\", the majority continued:\nBurton listed a number of aspects of contemporary baseball—the extensive farm system, broadcasting revenues, national advertising campaigns and even its reach beyond the borders of the United States—to justify his statement that \"it is a contradiction in terms to say that the defendants in the cases before us are not now engaged in interstate trade or commerce as those terms are used in the Constitution of the United States and in the Sherman Act\". He also cited a report by a House subcommittee that had come to a similar conclusion.\n\nHe conceded \"the major asset which baseball is to our Nation, the high place it enjoys in the hearts of our people, and the possible justification of special treatment for organized sports which are engaged in interstate trade or commerce\". But while it was certainly within Congress's power to repeal or specifically enact an antitrust exemption for baseball, it had not done so, \"and no court has demonstrated the existence of an implied exemption from that Act of any sport that is so highly organized as to amount to an interstate monopoly or which restrains interstate trade or commerce\". He concluded \"The present popularity of organized baseball increases, rather than diminishes, the importance of its compliance with standards of reasonableness comparable with those now required by law of interstate trade or commerce.\"\n\nWithin the next few terms, \"Toolson\"'s logic was criticized directly and indirectly by other justices, including some who had been in the majority, in dissents from opinions in which the Court held that it was specific to baseball and that even other professional sports weren't covered.\n\nChief Justice Earl Warren admitted, writing for the majority two years later when denying boxing the exemption, that \"this Court has never before considered the antitrust status of the boxing business. Yet, if it were not for \"Federal Baseball\" and \"Toolson\", we think that it would be too clear for dispute.\" Dissenters Felix Frankfurter and Sherman Minton, who were in the \"Toolson\" majority, were harshly critical. \"It would baffle the subtlest ingenuity to find a single differentiating factor between other sporting exhibitions ...and baseball insofar as the conduct of the sport is relevant to the criteria or considerations by which the Sherman Law becomes applicable to a 'trade or commerce.'\", the former wrote. \"I cannot translate even the narrowest conception of \"stare decisis\" into the equivalent of writing into the Sherman Law an exemption of baseball to the exclusion of every other sport different not one legal jot or tittle from it.\" Minton, in his dissent, added:\nAnother two years passed, and \"Radovich v. National Football League\" came before the Court. The circumstances of professional football at the time were almost identical to those of baseball, yet the Court ruled that the antitrust exemption was specific to the latter. Tom C. Clark, writing for a majority of six, defended the \"Toolson\" decision as preferable to the alternative: \"[M]ore harm would be done in overruling \"Federal Baseball\" than in upholding a ruling which, at best, was of dubious validity\" and admitted \"were we considering the question of baseball for the first time upon a clean slate, we would have no doubts.\"\n\nFrankfurter again expressed his incredulity. \"...[T]he most conscientious probing of the text and the interstices of the Sherman Law fails to disclose that Congress, whose will we are enforcing, excluded baseball — the conditions under which that sport is carried on — from the scope of the Sherman Law, but included football\", he said. He was joined in a separate opinion by John Marshall Harlan II signed by then-new justice William Brennan: \" I am unable to distinguish football from baseball under the rationale of \"Federal Baseball\" and \"Toolson\", and can find no basis for attributing to Congress a purpose to put baseball in a class by itself.\"\n\nIn 1970, St. Louis Cardinals star center fielder Curt Flood decided to refuse a trade to the Philadelphia Phillies and challenge the reserve clause again. Due to his stature as a player, his case attracted wide attention. It reached the Court in 1972. Although Flood lost, widespread support for his suit paved the way for free agency.\n\nWilliam O. Douglas, who had been on the \"Toolson\" majority, had ruled in a 1971 emergency appeal from a suit brought by Spencer Haywood that basketball wasn't exempt, either, and suggested he was reconsidering his role in \"Toolson\": \"the decision in this suit would be similar to the one on baseball's reserve clause which our decisions exempting baseball from the antitrust laws have foreclosed.\" The following year he was the only justice from the \"Toolson\" court still sitting when \"Flood v. Kuhn\" was heard, and made his change of mind explicit in a footnote to his dissent: \"While I joined the Court's opinion in \"Toolson\" ... I have lived to regret it; and I would now correct what I believe to be its fundamental error.\"\n\nIn that case's majority opinion, Harry Blackmun conceded that the facts no longer supported the exemption and that baseball was indeed interstate commerce, but echoed Clark in suggesting that the consequences of overturning the previous decisions would be worse than letting it stand. Chief Justice Warren Burger agreed in a short concurrence that also indicated his acceptance of Douglas's regret.\n\nSports business historian Andrew Zimbalist attributes the unexpected outcome to \"a game of cat and mouse\" between Congress and the Court:\nMuch of the criticism of \"Toolson\" over the years has viewed it as the middle term of the sequence that begins with \"Federal Baseball Club\" and ends with \"Flood\", and considers it in that context. Its embrace of \"stare decisis\" and presumption of congressional inaction as a justification, is notably at odds with the position that Justice Felix Frankfurter took when writing for the Court in a 1940 trust-law case, \"Helvering v. Hallock\", where prior flawed decisions had not been corrected through legislative action, that \"it would require very persuasive circumstances enveloping Congressional silence to debar this Court from re-examining its own doctrines\"\n\nOne critic, antitrust expert Kevin McDonald of Jones Day, singles out the 1953 case for having truly created the antitrust exemption by reading congressional intent into Holmes' original opinion. After quoting the \"per curiam\"'s closing sentence, he writes:\n\nLower courts, he said, took the court's reasoning to mean that other professional team sports were also exempt, forcing the justices to clarify that it only applied to baseball, and criticize their earlier ruling, in order to sustain decisions that football and boxing were interstate commerce and within the scope of antitrust law.\n\nToolson's career was over, and MLB resumed its \"status quo ante\". But the underlying issues remained, and a decade later began to be addressed when players unionized as the Major League Baseball Players Association, with free agency one of many goals.\n\nTwo years later, baseball held its first amateur draft, ending the system whereby wealthier and successful teams like the Yankees were able to keep their farm teams stocked with talent the way they had with Toolson, not only as insurance against player injuries but to prevent opposing teams from signing them. That ended the continuous domination of the Yankees.\n\nDespite legal and judicial criticism and embarrassment, baseball's antitrust exemption remains in effect. Players in the major leagues won free agency with the Seitz decision in 1975, and the 1998 Curt Flood Act gave major league players, but not others involved in baseball, rights under the antitrust laws. But for players in the minor leagues, like Toolson, the reserve system persists, and they are still bound to the organization that initially signed them.\n\n\n"}

As a \"model law\", it only specifies a set of guidelines, and each of the States should decide if to pass it or not, separately. UCITA has been drafted by National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL).\n\nUCITA has been designed to clarify issues which were not addressed by existing Uniform Commercial Code. \"Few disagree that the current Uniform Commercial Code is ill-suited for use with licensing and other intangible transactions,\" said practicing attorney Alan Fisch.\n\nUCITA has faced severe opposition from various groups.\n\nUCITA has only been passed in two states, Virginia and Maryland. The law did not pass in other states. Nevertheless, legal scholars, such as noted commercial law professor Jean Braucher, believe that the UCITA offers academic value.\n\nA resolution recommending approval of UCITA by the American Bar Association (ABA) has been withdrawn by the NCCUSL in 2003, indicating that UCITA lacks the consensus which is necessary for it to become a uniform act.\n\nUCITA focuses on adapting current commercial trade laws to the modern software era. It is particularly controversial in terms of computer software. The code would automatically make a software maker liable for defects and errors in the program. However, it allows a shrinkwrap license to override any of UCITA's provisions. As a result, commercial software makers can include such a license in the box and not be liable for errors in the software. Free software that is normally distributed through downloads, however, would not be able to force a shrinkwrap license and would therefore be liable for errors. Small software makers without legal knowledge would also be at risk.\n\nUCITA would explicitly allow software makers to make any legal restrictions they want on their software by calling the software a license in the EULA, rather than a sale. This would therefore take away purchasers right to resell used software under the first sale doctrine. Without UCITA, courts have often ruled that despite the EULA claiming a license, the actual actions by the software company and purchaser clearly shows it was a purchase, meaning that the purchaser has the right to resell the software to anyone.\n\nUCITA started as an attempt to modify the Uniform Commercial Code by introducing a new article: Article 2B (also known as UCC2B).\nThe committee for drafting UCC2B consisted of members from both the NCCUSL and the American Law Institute (ALI). At a certain stage of the process, ALI withdrew from the drafting process, effectively killing UCC2B. Afterwards, the NCCUSL renamed UCC2B into UCITA and proceeded on its own.\n\nBefore ratification, each state may amend its practices, thus creating different conditions in each state. This means that the final \"as read\" UCITA document is what is actually passed and signed into law by each state governor. The passage record typically indicates each version of UCITA submitted for ratification.\n\nTwo states, Virginia and Maryland, passed UCITA in 2000, shortly after its completion by the NCCUSL in 1999. However, beginning with Iowa that same year, numerous additional states have passed so-called \"bomb-shelter\" laws enabling citizen protections against UCITA-like provisions.\n\n\n\n"}

Unifund sought reimbursement from the Insurance Corp of British Columbia under the Ontario law.

The proposed amendment was put to a referendum on 15 February 2009 and endorsed by 54% of the electorate, with approximately 70% of registered voters participating.<ref name=\"BBC 16/2\"></ref>\n\nA proposal for an important change in the main structure of the Constitution, that included abolishing presidential term limits among major social, economical and political changes was rejected in 2007 when university students led protests and played a critical role in the result; President Hugo Chávez had said the reform was needed to implement his socialist program. Chávez conceded defeat by saying \"for now, we couldn't\" \"(\"por ahora no pudimos\"\"), echoing the phrase he used after the failure of his February 1992 attempted coup d'état against the Carlos Andrés Pérez government.\n\nOn 30 November 2008, six days after regional elections, Hugo Chávez announced on television that he would be open to a new wave of discussion on the proposal for allowing the postulation without limits to presidential candidature. The following day, his supporters started working towards a constitutional amendment for this goal.\n\nThe full title of the law was Amendment No. 1 of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (\"Enmienda No. 1 de la Constitucion de Republica Bolivariana de Venezuela\"). It was approved by a majority of the members of the National Assembly. The United Socialist Party of Venezuela (Chávez's political party) states that the initiative was backed by more than six million people. The amendment affects Articles 160, 162, 174, 192 and 230 of the constitution. They are amended as follows:\n\nArticle 341 of the constitution, which governs amendments, states that \"amendments shall be numbered consecutively and shall be published beneath the Constitution without altering the text of the latter\". Therefore, the 2009 amendment has not altered the original text of the constitution. Rather, Amendment No.1 (including new texts for each of the five amended articles) is published below the original text as a codicil.\n\nThe question elaborated by the National Electoral Council was:\n\nOpinion polls conducted on the measure in December 2008 varied widely, with results ranging from 32% approval (with 61% disapproval) to 51% approval (with 39% disapproval). The final results were as follows:\n\nThese figures were given in the second partial official bulletin, issued when canvassing reached a 98.81% of the votes. The trends are deemed to be irreversible. Final results are awaited in the following days.\n\nThe initial reaction of the opposition to the referendum proposal was that it was illegal. Henry Ramos, secretary general of the opposition party Acción Democrática called the proposal \" 'illegal and unconstitutional' because Article 345 says that 'A revised constitutional reform initiative may not be submitted during the same constitutional term of office of the National Assembly.' \" Chávez avoided this issue by declaring that the change to the constitution would be in the form of an amendment, instead of a constitutional reform. In addition, the constitutional amendment was re-defined to apply to all popular elected positions, not just to the president. Elenis Rodríguez Martínez, a leader of the opposition party Primero Justicia, stated that the proposed change constitutes a fundamental change to the constitution, and therefore cannot be voted as an amendment. She stated that, \"Under Article 340, 'the purpose of an amendment is to add to or modify one or more articles of the Constitution, without altering the fundamental structure of the same.' When the president says that he wants to delete some words from Article 230 of the Constitution, he is lying, because he really wants to remove an essential part of the text and in doing so he is altering its structure, as well as part of the provisions of Article 6, which reads that 'the government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is ... alternating' (...) This is a camouflaged reform.\" However, the Constitutional Court ruled that such a change was within the scope of a constitutional amendment, and that such an amendment could be re-attempted each year. The editors of Venezuelan publishing house \"Veneconomy\" argue that the 15 February date is too soon to comply with time-frames set forth by the suffrage law and related laws for the registration of voters newly-turned-18 and for the organization of polling stations.\n\nStudents again took a leading role in protests, as they did in the campaign against the 2007 referendum. On 16 January students blocked a Caracas highway, burned trees and taunted the police. After viewing video of the protests, Chávez gave the order: \"Throw lots of (tear) gas at them, and take them prisoner for me. If you don't, I'm going to go after the authorities responsible.\" Tensions rose in advance of the referendum, with a group of 40 armed men taking over the Caracas city hall, to which an opposition mayor had been elected in November, and declaring the building \"recovered for the revolution\". Tear gas was also thrown at the compound of the papal nuncio, who had granted asylum to an anti-Chávez student leader accused of sexual assault; and an anti-Chávez student leader's car was burned.\n\nOpposition figures have accused Chávez of using all the resources of the government to support the Yes campaign, ranging from near-total support for the Yes campaign on state radio and television to placement of Yes campaign ads on official ministry websites. According to opposition figure Leopoldo López, \"we aren’t competing against a political party, we’re competing against an entire state and all of the power it can wield\". The opposition also says that No campaign ads have had their approval delayed and scheduling manipulated by the National Electoral Council.\n\nFollowing claims that US officials had met with Venezuelan opposition leaders in Puerto Rico (which the US denied), Chávez accused U.S. President Barack Obama of meddling in the referendum, adding that \"He's said I'm an obstacle for progress in Latin America... Therefore it must be removed, this obstacle, right?\" Chávez also added that Obama was under pressure from the Pentagon to be tough on Venezuela by quoting: \"He [Obama] knows that if he doesn't obey the orders of the empire, they'll probably kill him.\"\n\nPresident of Brazil Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva backed Hugo Chávez's proposal of a possible re-election and asked why nobody criticized Colombian President Álvaro Uribe, who was also proposing the removal of Colombia's current two-term limit, having already removed the previous one-term limit, a move that made possible his re-election in 2006.\n\nAround 100 international observers were accredited to observe the vote, but neither the Organization of American States nor the European Union had official observers in Venezuela. Observers from Latin American nations, European Parliament members, and European academics said that the ballot had been free and fair. Despite Chávez's hostile relationship with the United States, the United States Department of State spokesman Noel Clay praised the \"civic spirit\" of the referendum. He added that it was important that elected officials in Venezuela focused on \"governing democratically\".\n\nOn 13 February 2009, the Venezuelan government expelled Luis Herrero, a Spanish member of the European Parliament (and member of the European People's Party), after he called Chávez a dictator and criticized Chávez's handling of the constitutional referendum. One of the parties in the opposition to Chávez had asked Herrero to observe the referendum.\n\nIn April 2009 NACLA reported that its observers had found that \"the voting in Venezuela’s 2009 referendum was, overall, fair, transparent, and clean.\"\n\n\n"}
