{"id": "19932294", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19932294", "title": "Anti-homelessness legislation", "text": "Anti-homelessness legislation\n\nAnti-homelessness legislation can take two forms; legislation that aims to help and re-house homeless people, and legislation that is intended to send the homeless to homeless shelters compulsively, or criminalize homelessness and begging.\n\nSince the publication of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Charter of the United Nations — UN) in 1948, the public perception has been increasingly changing to a focus on the human right to housing, travel and migration as a part of individual self-determination rather than the human condition. The Declaration, an international law reinforcement of the Nuremberg Trial Judgements, upholds the rights of one nation to intervene in the affairs of another if said nation is abusing its citizens, and rose out of a 1939–1945 World War II Atlantic environment of extreme split between \"haves\" and \"have nots.\" Article 6 of the 1998 Declaration of Human Duties and Responsibilities declares that members of the global community have individual and collective duties and responsibilities to take appropriate action to prevent the commission gross or systematic human rights abuses. The modern study of homeless phenomena is most frequently seen in this historical context.\n\nLaws supporting homeless people generally place obligations on the state to support or house homeless people.\n\nThe 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act required parish unions to supply houses for workers but these unions purposely made these work houses unattractive in order to discourage workers from applying for housing. This Act also made casual wards known as \"spikes\" available for thoses who needed temporary housing in return for their labor. It was estimated that approximately 30,000 to 80,000 people used the spikes in the early 1900s in Great Britain.\n\nThe Homelessness etc. (Scotland) Act 2003 was legislation passed by the Scottish Parliament that set the goal of providing permanent residence to those deemed unintentionally homeless. Following, the Homeless Persons (Unsuitable Accommodation) (Scotland) Order 2004 was passed in 2004. This order made it so that, unless exceptional circumstances were present, any familial unit including children or an expectant mother was not placed in \"unsuitable temporary housing\". Scotland's most recent anti-homelessness legislation is entitled The Housing Support Services (Homelessness)(Scotland) Regulations 2012, and it came into full effect on June 1, 2013. These regulations require local authorities to assist the homeless in a variety of ways, including help in adjusting to a new living situation, debt counseling and managing a personal budget.\n\nThe first, and primary, anti-homelessness act passed in the United States is entitled the McKinney–Vento Homeless Assistance Act. This act was originally passed in 1987, and has subsequently been amended four times. The 1988 amendment to the act focused on revising the way in which the funds of the McKinney–Vento Homeless Assistance Act were distributed. The following amendment in 1990 established new programs, including the Shelter Care Plus Program, whose focus was in assisting those with disabilities through housing support. There were a variety of additions due to the 1992 amendments, including the implementation of \"safe havens\" which would allow those whom do not wish to participate in the services offered to receive low cost housing. Another primary change created by the amendments of 1992 was the creation of the Access to Community Care and Effective Services and Support program (or ACCESS); this program was created in order to assist the homeless people who had both serious mental illness issues, as well as substance abuse problems and lasted a total of 5 years. The final amendment to the McKinney–Vento Homeless Assistance Act occurred in 1994, and it specified the amendment of the Surplus Property Program and the Education of the Homeless Children and Youth program.\n\nThe Fair Housing Act passed in 1968 was designed to protect those who were traditionally discriminated against by housing agencies because of their race, gender, religion, familial status, and disability. Some states and cities also gave homeless people equal access to housing accommodations regardless of their income. Although this Act did not specifically refer to the homeless population, the main beneficiaries of this law were homeless individuals.\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, also known as the ADA states that people with disabilities must be given appropriate housing accommodations that meet their special needs. Additionally, people with disabilities should be given the chance to interact with people who do not have disability. This Act ensures that homeless individuals are not discriminated against because of their special needs.\n\nUse of the law that criminalizes the homeless generally takes on one of five forms:\n\nThe 1977 Housing (Homeless Persons) Act greatly restricted the homeless housing requirements so that only individuals who were affected by natural disasters could receive housing accommodations from the local authorities. This led to the rejection of the majority of homeless applications received by the local government. This Act also made it difficult for homeless individuals without children to receive accommodations provided by local authorities.\n\nThe National Coalition for the Homeless reports that there is a growing trend in the United States towards criminalizing the state of being homeless. Proponents of this approach believe that punitive measures will deter people from choosing to be homeless. To this end, cities across the country increasingly outlaw activities such as sleeping, eating, sitting, and begging in public spaces, and selectively enforce more neutral laws—such as those prohibiting open containers or loitering—against homeless populations. Violators of such laws typically incur criminal penalties, which result in fines and/or incarceration.\n\nIn \"Jones v. City of Los Angeles\", the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that \"the Eighth Amendment prohibits the City from punishing involuntary sitting, lying, or sleeping on public sidewalks that is an unavoidable consequence of being human and homeless without shelter in the City of Los Angeles\". However on October 15, 2007, the Court vacated its opinion after the parties settled the case and sought withdrawal of the Opinion.\n\nCritics of homeless criminalization claim that such measures do nothing to actually solve homelessness and in fact make matters worse. Homeless people find it harder to secure employment, housing, or federal benefits with a criminal record, and therefore penalizing the act of being homeless makes exiting such a situation much more difficult. Although the court's opinion in \"Jones v. City of Los Angeles\" (see above) was vacated, the result suggests that criminalizing homelessness may be unconstitutional. Similarly, in response to growing reports of hate crimes, some state governments have proposed the addition of \"people experiencing homelessness\" to their hate-crimes statutes.\n\nThe authors of a 2017 study on homelessness stated that homeless people have a higher incidence of sickness, with their most common health problem being skin problems. Homeless people also have a lack of access to sanitation, leading to poor hygiene. These characteristics are noticeable and may trigger reactions of disgust from onlookers who are inclined, at an evolutionary level, to be pathogen-averse. This leads the general public to keep their physical distance from homeless people, and promotes exclusionary policies. As an example, these authors state that while the majority of the general public support subsidized housing for homeless individuals, they do not want that housing in their own neighborhood.\n\nBut the public also maintains concern for the homeless, supporting increases in federal spending on homelessness programs. In fact, when surveyed, the public supports spending on homelessness over other social problems by consistently putting the homeless in the top third of their spending priorities.\n\nRespondents to surveys also feel that 55% of homeless people are addicted to drugs or alcohol, and that 45% of homeless people have been to jail before. The majority of U.S. residents surveyed also think that homeless people make neighborhood worse, and that their presence brings down the profitability of local businesses.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2227018", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2227018", "title": "Casual wear", "text": "Casual wear\n\nCasual attire or casual wear, clothing is a Western dress code category that comprises anything not approporiate with formal attire, semi-formal attire, or informal attire dress codes. In general, casual attire is associated with emphasising personal comfort and individuality over formality or conformity. As such, this type of dress may also be referred to as leisurewear. The word \"casual\" can in a broader sense be defined as something relaxed, occasional, spontaneous, or \"informal\" in the sense of \"not formal\" or \"suited for everyday use\" (although notably informal attire actually refers to a dress code more formal than casual attire, a step below semi-formal attire). Yet, when indicated as a dress code for instance on an invitation, casual attire may still be expected to be done tastefully, meaning that trousers and shirts do not have holes, tears, or stains. \n\nBecause of its wide variety of interpretations per definition, casual attire may be defined not by what it \"is\" by rather what \"is not\":\n\nNotably, however, dress codes within casual attire category such as business casual, smart casual or dress clothes may indicate expectation of some sartorial effort, including suit jacket, dress trousers, closely resembling the result of informal attire.\n\nSport coat, Blazer, Jeans, Dress Shirt, Casual Collared Shirt, and a T-shirt describe to be a casual wear for men. With the popularity of spectator sports in the late 20th century, a good deal of athletic gear has influenced casual wear, such as Adidas suits, running shoes, and track clothing. Clothing worn for manual labor also falls into casual wear. Basic materials used for casual wear include denim, cotton, jersey, polyester, flannel, and fleece. Materials such as velvet, chiffon, and brocade could be considered too fancy for casual wear. \n\nWhile utilitarian costume comes to mind first for casual dress, however, there is also a wide range of flamboyance and theatricality. Punk clothes and fashion of the 1970s and 1980s is a striking example. Madonna introduced a great deal of lace, jewelry, and cosmetics into casual wear during the 1980s. More recently, hip hop fashion has played up elaborate jewelry and luxurious materials worn in conjunction with athletic gear and the clothing of manual labor.\n\nCasual wear is typically the dress code in which new forms of gender expression are attempted before being accepted into semi-casual or semi-formal situations. An obvious example is masculine jewelry, which was once considered shocking or titillating even in casual circles, and is now hardly noteworthy in semi-formal situations. Amelia Bloomer introduced trousers (of a sort) for women as a casual alternative to formal hoops and skirts. In a recent mirror image, sarongs and other skirts have been embraced by a few men of the European tradition as a casual alternative to formal trousers. Both of these innovations caused great embarrassment in formal circles. The trend toward female exposure in the 20th century has also pushed the necklines of formal ball gowns ever lower and the skirts of cocktail dresses ever higher. For men, the exposure of shoulders, thighs, and backs is still limited to casual wear.\n\n"}
{"id": "445823", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=445823", "title": "Constructive dismissal", "text": "Constructive dismissal\n\nIn employment law, constructive dismissal, also called constructive discharge or constructive termination, occurs when an employee resigns as a result of the employer creating a hostile work environment. Since the resignation was not truly voluntary, it is, in effect, a termination. For example, when an employer places extraordinary and unreasonable work demands on an employee to obtain their resignation, this can constitute a constructive dismissal.\n\nThe exact legal consequences differ between different countries, but generally a constructive dismissal leads to the employee's obligations ending and the employee acquiring the right to make claims against the employer.\n\nThe employee may resign over a single serious incident or over a pattern of incidents. Generally, a party seeking relief must have resigned soon after one of the constructive acts.\n\nIn the United States, constructive discharge is a general term describing the involuntary resignation of an employee. There is no single federal or state law against constructive dismissal in general. From a legal standpoint, it occurs when an employee is forced to resign because of intolerable working conditions which violate employment legislation, such as:\n\nThe burden of proof in constructive dismissal cases lies with the employee.\n\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has provided a 3-part test to determine whether or not a constructive discharge has occurred: (1) a reasonable person in the complainant’s position would have found the working conditions intolerable; (2) conduct that constituted discrimination against the complainant created the intolerable working conditions; and (3) the complainant’s involuntary resignation resulted from the intolerable working conditions. \n\nIn California, the California Supreme Court defines constructive discharge as follows:\n\n\"In order to establish a constructive discharge, an employee must plead and prove, by the usual preponderance of the evidence standard, that the employer either intentionally created or knowingly permitted working conditions that were so intolerable or aggravated at the time of the employee's resignation that a reasonable employer would realize that a reasonable person in the employee's position would be compelled to resign.\"\n\nCanadian courts recognize there are circumstances in which the employer, although not acting explicitly to terminate an individual’s employment, alters the employment relationship’s terms and conditions to such a degree that an employee is entitled to regard the employer’s conduct as a termination, and claim wrongful dismissal, just as if they had been let go without any notice or termination pay in lieu of notice.\n\nConstructive dismissal arises from the failure of the employer to live up to the essential obligations of the employment relationship, regardless of whether the employee signed a written employment contract. Employment law implies into employment relationships a common-law set of terms and conditions applicable to all employees. For example, once agreed upon, wages are implicitly locked in by the common-law of contract as an essential term of the employment relationship. In this regard, it is a constructive dismissal if an employer fails to pay an employee.\n\nAn employer’s breach of the employment contract releases the employee from their obligation to perform under the contract, and thus treat themselves as dismissed. Hence, a constructive dismissal always becomes a wrongful dismissal.\n\nTypically, the first way to claim constructive dismissal involves an employer making substantial changes to the employment contract, such as:\n\n\nIn addition, failure on the part of an employer to provide employment standards (i.e. overtime pay, vacation pay, etc.), can result in a constructive dismissal.\n\nNevertheless, for an employee to have a successful case for constructive dismissal, the employer’s breach must be fundamental. What is “fundamental” depends on the circumstances, and not all changes to the employment relationship give rise to a constructive dismissal. For example, administrative, i.e. non-disciplinary, suspensions might not amount to a constructive dismissal if imposed in good faith and justified by legitimate business reasons (i.e. lack of work). As well, a small reduction in salary, in tough times, and administered rationally, might not be a constructive dismissal.\n\nAn employee may also be able to claim a constructive dismissal based on an employer’s conduct, rather than a change to a specific or implied term of the employment contract. Here, the second way to claim constructive dismissal examines whether the employer’s (or employee of the employer) course of conduct, or even a single incident, demonstrates an intention to no longer be bound by the written or implied employment contract. An example of this kind of constructive dismissal is a “toxic work environment”. In this regard, if a work environment is so poisoned that a reasonable person wouldn’t be expected to return, then constructive dismissal is likely.\n\nA toxic work environment is classically defined as unjustified criticism as well as vague and unfounded accusations of poor performance, especially where authority and respect with co-workers had been seriously undermined and compromised. Another example of toxic work environment is where the employer fails to prevent workplace harassment.\n\nIn United Kingdom law, constructive dismissal is defined by the Employment Rights Act 1996 section 95(1)c:\n\nThe Department of Trade and Industry states:\n\nFollowing a constructive dismissal, claim for \"unfair dismissal\" and a claim for \"wrongful dismissal\" may arise.\n\nAlthough they tend to blend into one in a tribunal, strictly there are two types of constructive dismissal: statutory and common law.\n\nAt common law the requirement is acceptance of a repudiatory breach, which means the employer has indicated it no longer considers itself bound by an essential term of the contract, e.g. the requirement to pay wages or the requirement not to destroy the mutual bond of trust and confidence. It matters not if the employer did not mean to repudiate the contract.\n\nUnder statute the requirement is employer's \"conduct\" allowing the employee to \"terminate without notice\"; as this can only happen with a repudiatory breach it amounts to the same thing.\n\nA common mistake is to assume that constructive dismissal is exactly the same as unfair treatment of an employee – it can sometimes be that treatment that can be considered generally evenhanded nevertheless makes life so difficult that the employee is in essence forced to resign (e.g., a fair constructive dismissal might be a unilateral change of contract justified by a bigger benefit to the business than the inconvenience to the employee), but the Employment Appeal Tribunal doubts that it will be very often that the employer can breach ERA96 s98(4) whilst being fair.\n\nA constructive dismissal occurs when the employer's serious breach causes the employee to accept that the contract has been terminated, by resigning. The fairness of it would have to be looked at separately under a statutory claim for unfair dismissal.\n\nThe problems for the employer are that constructive dismissal is a contractual claim, which can be made in a tribunal for up to £25,000 or in court without limit, and, by dismissing constructively, it by definition misses out on the correct procedure meaning that even if the reason was fair, the decision was probably not, and so an unfair dismissal usually arises, creating a statutory claim alongside the contractual claim.\n\nThe court can look behind the lack of, or different, stated reason given by the employee at the time of resignation to establish that a cover story was in fact a resignation caused by fundamental breach.\n\nThe person causing the dismissal does not need the authority to dismiss, as long as they acted in the course of employment.\n\nConstructive dismissal is typically caused by:-\n\n\nA flexibility clause does not allow the employer to change a type of job as it is implied that the flexibility is to operate within the original job.\n\nA mobility clause is subject to the implied term of mutual trust which prevents the employer from sending an employee to the other side of the country without adequate notice or from doing anything which makes it impossible for the employee to keep his side of the bargain.\n\nThere is no right to automatic pay rises. Nor is a smoking ban a breach.\n\nThe employee's conduct is irrelevant to liability, although it can affect quantum; in other words it cannot get the employer off the hook, but could reduce compensation if he helped bring about his own downfall.\n\nThe conduct by the employer could be:\n\n\nThe employee has to resign within a reasonable time of the trigger, which is the one-off outrage or the last straw. The employee could work under protest while he or she finds a new job.\n\nIf the employer alleges that the employee waived a breach by not resigning, each breach needs to be looked at to see if it was waived separately, but even if a breach was waived, the last straw revives it for the purpose of determining whether overall there was a repudiation.\n\nIf the employer alleges that the employee has affirmed a breach by not resigning, the employee could point out that no consideration was paid for it and so no contract change has been accepted. Acceptance of a replacement job would prove affirmation.\n\nAn employee who stays on for a year after refusing to sign a new contract does not necessarily accept it.\n\nThe last straw does not have to be similar to the earlier string of events or even unreasonable or blameworthy – it need only be related to the obligation of trust and confidence and enough that when added to the earlier events the totality is a repudiation.\n\nAlthough the employer's breach must be serious enough to entitle the employee to resign without notice, the employee is entitled to give notice if they prefer, so that they could enjoy the benefit of wages during the notice period.\n\nTo prevent the employer alleging that the resignation was caused by a job offer, the employee should resign first and then seek a new job during the notice period.\n\nDuring the notice period, the employer could make the employee redundant or summarily dismiss them, if it has the grounds to do so fairly. Otherwise, the reason for termination will be resignation and not dismissal, since the employee cannot serve a counternotice.\n"}

Among the 18th-century Irish Patriot Party it was called the Act of Annexation.\n\nOne of the earlier Christian overkingdoms, the Holy See of Rome, in 1171 abolished the High Kingship of Ireland (of 9th-century origin, successor to the Kingship of Tara) and devalued the ancient Kingdoms of Ireland.\n\nUnder a Papal Bull, the ancient realm was disestablished and turned into a feudal Province of the Secretariat of State of the Roman Catholic Church under the temporal power of the monarch of England who henceforth held the title Lord of Ireland, relinquishing to the Papacy annual the tribute levied upon the nobility and people of Ireland.\n\nThe Act was passed in the Parliament of Ireland, meeting in Dublin, on 18 June 1541, being read out to parliament in English and Irish.\n\nThe secession of various European rulers during the Protestant Reformation, including Henry VIII, inspired the Papacy to initiate the Counter-Reformation. One consequence of this was that the Papacy required all Roman Catholic rulers to consider Protestant rulers (and their loyal subjects) as heretics, thus making their realms illegitimate under customary Roman Catholic international law. Consequently, the title \"King of Ireland\" was not initially recognised by Europe's Catholic monarchs and the Papacy. Instead, they remained committed in considering Ireland a feudal fief of the Papacy, to be granted to any Catholic sovereign who managed to secure the island Kingdom from the control of its Protestant monarchs.\n\nAfter the death of Henry VIII's only legitimate son, Edward VI, the throne passed to his oldest daughter, Mary I, who was a devout Roman Catholic. Mary shortly thereafter married Philip of Spain, who was also staunchly Catholic. The new monarch restored papal authority in both England and Ireland. However, the status of Ireland as a kingdom remained in question: would the Papacy recognise Ireland's existence as a kingdom in its own right or maintain some fiction of temporal papal power in the land? To rectify this, Pope Paul IV issued a papal bull in 1555, \"\", recognising Philip and Mary as King and Queen of England and its dominions including Ireland. Although this did not explicitly recognise Ireland as a kingdom, it represents the surrender of most of the Papacy's declared authority over Ireland, elevating it from a mere province of the Holy See to one that united Ireland's and England's crowns in one person.\n\nMary died without issue in 1558, and the thrones of England and Ireland passed to her half-sister, Elizabeth I, who was a Protestant. Once again, both kingdoms were removed from papal authority. In reply, Pope Pius V issued a papal bull in 1570, \"Regnans in Excelsis\", declaring \"Elizabeth, the pretended Queen of England and the servant of crime\" to be a heretic and releasing all her subjects from any allegiance to her and excommunicating any that obeyed her orders.\n\nOver the course of the next two centuries, the Papacy and Europe's Catholic rulers continued to recognise Ireland as a Kingdom in its own right, whilst at the same time asserting its Protestant monarchy as illegitimate. Simultaneously, they would incite Catholic rebellion to Protestants in the island as a means of recovering Ireland to a Catholic sovereign, preceding the establishment of a Catholic sovereign on the English and Scottish thrones. In reply, British diplomacy concentrated on receiving the recognition of the sovereignty of Ireland from Catholic Europe in the hope of thereby ending future Catholic sovereign incitements of the larger Catholic peasantry and securing the western flank of Great Britain from Catholic invasion. \n\nUntil 1801, Ireland continued to exist as a Kingdom in its own right, with its own Parliament. The government of Ireland, however, remained in English hands even after Grattan's constitution came into effect in the 1780s. Most of the country's population remained Catholic, but its Protestant minority remained socially, politically, and economically dominant; and even many Protestants were excluded from power as not being members of the established Church of Ireland. The Penal Laws preserving the position of the Protestant Ascendancy began to be dismantled in the 1780s and 1790s. However, fear of revolutionary violence in the wake of the French Revolution and the French Revolutionary Wars and subsequent republican Irish Rebellion of 1798 led the British government to seek the union of Ireland with Great Britain; this resulted in the formation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\n\nAs a result of the Anglo-Irish Treaty that ended the Irish War of Independence, Ireland left the United Kingdom in 1922 and became the Irish Free State, a mostly self-governing Dominion that still retained the British monarch as its head of state. Shortly thereafter, the six north-eastern counties (Northern Ireland) seceded from the Free State and rejoined the United Kingdom, but with their own parliament and system of government. Despite these fundamental changes, the 16th-century Act remained unamended on the statute books. \n\nFrom a British perspective, the Irish Free State became legislatively independent with the passage in the British parliament of the Statute of Westminster 1931. However, the Irish Free State considered itself legislatively independent before its passage and did not recognize its legal situation as being changed. The country thereafter shared the person of its monarch with the United Kingdom and the other Dominions of the then-called British Commonwealth.\n\nThe Irish Free State adopted a new constitution in 1937, although the Irish monarchy was not abolished in UK law until the Republic of Ireland Act 1948. The Tudor Act remained on the republic's statute books until formally repealed in 1962.\n\n, Northern Ireland remains a constituent part of the United Kingdom; the Henrician Act remains law there. However, the offence in the act making it treason to endanger the sovereign or her possession of the Crown now carries only a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, following the completion of the abolition of capital punishment in the United Kingdom in 1998.\n\n"}

The Court of Session disproved of the Lord Ordinary's action of adopting other parts of the pamphlet that the expert had not made reference to.\n\nLord President Cooper stated that \"their duty is to furnish the judge or jury with the necessary scientific criteria for testing the accuracy of their conclusions, so as to enable the Judge or jury to form their own independent judgment by the application of these criteria to the facts proved in evidence.\" Therefore, an expert witness should only offer their opinion as to the facts that have already been established in court, and \"should not hinder the trier of fact's duty by telling them how to assess the evidence that they have heard\". The weight to be given to the evidence provided by the expert witness is a matter for the judge (in civil, or summary criminal proceedings) or jury (in solemn criminal proceedings) alone.\n\nThe court also stated that \"expert witnesses are only required in order that certain facts can be assessed and understood in their specialist/scientific context\".\n\nMoreover, in this case it was held that \"in some situations, the scientific knowledge that an expert witness claims to have must be proved in court\", such as in \"Hewat v Edinburgh Corporation\" 1974 S.C. 30.

The underlying technology was established by a consortium of lighting equipment manufacturers as a successor for lighting control systems, and as an open standard alternative to Digital Signal Interface (DSI), on which it is based.\n\nDALI is specified by technical standards IEC 62386 and IEC 60929. Standards conformance ensures that equipment from different manufacturers will interoperate. The DALI trademark is allowed on devices that comply with the current standards when manufactured.\n\nMembers of the AG DALI (founded by Philips lighting in 1984) were freely allowed to use the DALI trademark until DALI working party was dissolved on 30th March 2017. Since 9th June 2017, Digital Illumination Interface Alliance (DiiA) certifies DALI equipment. DiiA is a Partner Program of IEEE-ISTO.\n\nA DALI network consists of a controller, a power supply (which may be built into the controller) and one or more slave devices (e.g., electrical ballasts, LED drivers and dimmers) that have DALI interfaces. The controller can monitor and control each device by means of a bi-directional data exchange. The DALI protocol permits devices to be individually addressed and it also allows multiple devices to be addressed simultaneously via multicast and broadcast messages.\n\nEach device is assigned a unique static address in the numeric range 0 to 63, making possible up to 64 devices in a basic system. Addresses may be arbitrarily assigned and need not be contiguous. DALI gateways can be used to implement systems that have more than 64 devices. Data is transferred between controller and devices by means of an asynchronous, half-duplex, serial protocol over a two-wire bus, with a fixed data transfer rate of .\n\nA single pair of wires comprise the bus used for communication to all devices on a DALI network. The network can be arranged in a bus or star topology, or a combination of these. DALI is not classified as SELV (Separated Extra Low Voltage) and therefore its wiring may be run next to mains cables or within a multi-core cable which includes mains power. Data is transmitted using high voltages ( for \"0\" and for \"1\") enabling reliable communications in the presence of significant electrical noise.\n\nThe bus is used for both signal and power. A power supply provides 250 mA at 24 V DC; each device may draw up to 2 mA. While many devices are line-powered, low-power devices such as motion detectors may be powered directly from the DALI bus. Each device has a bridge rectifier on its input so it is polarity-insensitive. The bus is a wired-AND configuration where signals are sent by briefly shorting the bus to a low voltage level.\n\nThe bus is also defined to be polarity-insensitive, allowing DALI wires can be connected to a device without regard for polarity (the voltage specification allows plenty of headroom for a bridge rectifier in each slave), and the speed is kept low so no termination resistors are required.\n\nThe network cable is required to be mains-rated, with isolation and a maximum drop of along the cable. (The required cable size depends on the length of the bus, up to a maximum of 300 m with (15.4 AWG) conductors.)\n\nEach bit is sent Manchester coded (half a bit time of the data bit, followed by half a bit time of its complement), so that power is present for half of each bit time. When the bus is idle, it is high voltage all the time, which is not the same as a \"0\" or a \"1\" data bit. Frames begin with a \"0\" start bit, then 8 to 16 data bits in msbit-first order (standard RS-232 is lsbit-first), followed by a minimum two bit times of idle.\n\nEach device on a DALI network can be individually addressed, unlike DSI and 0–10V devices. Consequently, DALI networks use fewer wires than DSI or 0–10V systems.\n\nSome devices (e.g., HF ballasts) are mains powered, and only have functional isolation between the mains and the DALI control. This means that even though the DALI control cable operates at ELV potential, it must be treated as if it were at mains potential.\n\nDALI lighting levels are specified by an 8-bit value, where 0 means off, 1 means 0.1% of full brightness, 254 means full brightness, and other values are logarithmically interpolated between, giving a 2.77% increase per step. That is, a (non-zero) control byte denotes a power level of .\n\nA DALI device, such as a HF fluorescent ballast, can be controlled individually via its short address. In addition to this method of control, DALI devices can be arranged into groups in which all devices of the same Group can interact with each other. For example, a room with 4 ballasts can be changed from off to on in three common ways:\n\nUsing the Short Address, e.g. sending the following DALI messages:\n\nThis method has the advantage of not relying on the limited number of scenes available in each ballast, or having programmed each ballast with the required group numbers and scene information. The fade rate of the transition can be chosen on the fly.\nThis method can have an undesirable side effect called \"Mexican Wave\" when a single large room such as an auditorium contains many ballasts, due to network latency of the comparatively slow 1200 baud rate of DALI. For example, a transition from all on to all off may result in a visible delay between the first and last ballasts switching off. This issue is normally not a problem in rooms with smaller numbers of ballasts.\n\nUsing the DALI Group previously defined for the ballasts in the room, e.g.:\n\nThis method has the advantage of being immune to the “Mexican Wave” effect as described above.\nThis method has the disadvantage of requiring each ballast to be programmed with the required group numbers and scene information, and has a fixed fade rate which is pre set at the time of commissioning.\n\nUsing the DALI Broadcast command all, every ballasts will change to that level, e.g.:\n\nThe DALI protocol provides 254 levels of brightness between off and 100%. The brightness is translated to a ballast power level via a logarithmic dimming curve that matches eye sensitivity so that perceived brightness steps will have uniform brightness change, and to achieve a uniform brightness between units from different manufacturers.\n\nCommon commands specified by the DALI standard:\n\nA wireless extension to DALI is available that enables DALI networks to communicate via wireless, radio frequency communication.\n\nOn 2017-02-16 the Mesh Professional Lighting Subgroup was created as a forum to discuss and develop Bluetooth mesh technology as a foundation for the wireless lighting standard.\n\n\n"}

According to political scientist Rebecca Adler-Nissen, diplomatic capital is a kind of currency that can be traded in diplomatic negotiations and that is increased when positive ″social competences, reputation and personal authority\" are portrayed.\n\nDiplomatic capital can be accumulated for example by economic cooperation and by contributions to the solution of international crises, It is strengthened when in other countries the sentiment prevails that the interests of a state or the diplomats representing it are aligned with their own interests. Conversely, it can be squandered when a country engages in a confrontation, an armed conflict or a war, if that is perceived as unjust or at odds with the interests of others.\n\nDiplomatic capital is also linked to the extent of enforcement of human rights.\n\n"}

He was fluent in German, Romanian, Italian, Polish, Ukrainian, Yiddish, French, and English; during his life, von Rezzori was successively a citizen of Austria-Hungary, Romania, and the Soviet Union, before becoming a stateless person and spending his final years as a citizen of Austria. He married Beatrice Monti della Corte.\n\nGregor von Rezzori was born in Czernowitz, Bukovina, part of Austria-Hungary at the time (1914). He originated from a Sicilian aristocratic family from the Province of Ragusa who had settled in Vienna by the mid-18th century. His father was an Austrian civil servant based in Czernowitz. The family remained in the region after it became part of the Romanian Kingdom in 1919, and the young Gregor von Rezzori became a Romanian citizen.\n\nAfter World War I von Rezzori studied in colleges in Braşov, Fürstenfeld and Vienna. He began studying mining at the University of Leoben, then architecture and medicine at the University of Vienna, where he eventually graduated in arts.\n\nIn mid-1930 he moved to Bucharest, took up military service in the Romanian Army, and made a living as an artist. In 1938 he moved to Berlin, where he became active as a novelist, journalist, writer in radio broadcasting, and film production. Given his Romanian citizenship, von Rezzori was not drafted by Nazi authorities during World War II.\n\nUntil the mid-1950s, he worked as an author at the broadcasting company Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk. He regularly published novels and stories, as well as working in film production as a screenplay author and actor (starring alongside actors such as Brigitte Bardot, Jeanne Moreau, Anna Karina, Marcello Mastroianni or Charles Aznavour). Beginning in the early 1960s, Rezzori lived between Rome and Paris, with sojourns in the United States, eventually settling in Tuscany.\n\nBesides authoring and performing, he and his spouse Beatrice Monti della Corte were significant art collectors, and together founded the Santa Maddalena Retreat for Writers. He died in Santa Maddalena, part of Florence's Donnini \"frazione\".\n\nRezzori began his career as a writer of light novels, but he first encountered success in 1953 with the \"Maghrebinian Tales\", a suite of droll stories and anecdotes from an imaginary land called \"Maghrebinia\", which reunited in a grotesque and parodic key traits of his multicultural Bukovinian birthplace, of extinct Austria-Hungary and of Bucharest of his youth. Over the years, Rezzori published further \"Maghrebinian Tales\", which increased his reputation of language virtuosity and free spirit, writing with wit, insight and elegance.\n\nOther books, such as \"The Death of My Brother Abel\", \"Oedipus at Stalingrad\", or \"The Snows of Yesteryear\", recording the fading world at the time of the World Wars, have been celebrated for their powerful descriptive prose, nuance and style.\n\nVon Rezzori first came to the attention of English-speaking readers with the 1969 publication of the story \"Memoirs of an Anti-Semite,\" in \"The New Yorker.\" On this occasion, Elie Wiesel, who was born in Bukovina's neighboring Maramureş, wrote:\n\"Rezzori addresses the major problems of our time, and his voice echoes with the disturbing and wonderful magic of a true storyteller.\"\n\nThough not often heralded as the man behind the quote, it was his controversial \"The only convincing love story of our century\", attributed simply to \"Vanity Fair\", the magazine which published in English his original review of the book, that adorned the cover of the Second Vintage International edition of Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita.\n\nIn his \"Guide for Idiots through German Society\", von Rezzori also used his noted taste for satire. Although he was not unanimously perceived as a major author in the German-speaking area, his posthumous reception has arguably confirmed him among the most important modern German-language authors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4103722", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4103722", "title": "Groveland Four", "text": "Groveland Four\n\nThe Groveland Four (or the Groveland Boys) were four young African-American men, Earnest Thomas, Charles Greenlee (then a minor at age 16), Samuel Shepherd and Walter Irvin, who in 1949 were accused of raping a 17-year-old white woman and assaulting her husband in Lake County, Florida.\n\nThomas fled and was killed by a posse several days later and 200 miles away; Greenlee, Shepherd and Irvin were arrested. They were beaten in jail to coerce confessions, but Irvin did not confess. The three survivors were convicted at trial by an all-white jury. Greenlee was sentenced to life because he was only 16 at the time of the crime; the other two were sentenced to death. In 1951 the United States Supreme Court ordered a retrial after hearing appeals by the latter two men, led by Thurgood Marshall of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. It ruled they had not received a fair trial because of excessive adverse publicity and because blacks had been excluded from the jury.\n\nIn November 1951, Sheriff Willis McCall shot both Shepherd and Irvin while they were in his custody, saying they had tried to escape while he was transporting them from the state jail at Railford back to the county seat of Tavares, Florida, for the new trial. Shepherd died on the spot; Irvin survived his wounds and later told FBI investigators that the sheriff had shot them in cold blood and that his deputy Yates had also shot him in an attempt to finish him off. \n\nAt the second trial, Irvin was again convicted by an all-white jury and sentenced to death. In 1955 his sentence was commuted to life by recently elected Governor Leroy Collins. In 1968 Irvin was paroled. He died in February 1969 in Lake County.\n\nIn 2016 the City of Groveland and Lake County each apologized to survivors of the four men for the injustice against them. The four were posthumously exonerated on April 18, 2017, by a resolution of the Florida House of Representatives. The state senate quickly passed a similar resolution, and lawmakers called on Florida Governor Rick Scott to officially pardon the men.\n\n\n\n\nAfter returning to Groveland following their military service, Shepherd and Irvin both continued to wear their uniforms. They were proud of their service, which some of the local whites resented. Sheriff Willis McCall was known for supporting segregation, and keeping a strong hold on workers and against union organizing. He was part of ensuring there was a ready supply of low-wage workers to man the orange groves. Shepherd could work with his father, and Irvin was determined to find an alternative to the orange groves.\n\nNorma Padgett, a 17-year-old white woman, and her husband Willie, said that on July 16, 1949, they had been attacked by four young black men in Groveland, Florida, who stopped where the couple's car had stalled. Norma said she was taken away and raped, and Willie said he had been assaulted. Ernest Thomas, Charles Greenlee, age 16; Samuel Shepherd, age 22, and Walter Irvin, age 22, were identified by the police as suspects. Shepherd and Irvin were both veterans of service in the Army; and both Thomas and Greenlee were married. \n\nIrvin and Shepherd were arrested shortly after Padgett complained of the attack. The police took the men in their patrol car to a secluded spot and ordered them out of the car. Both men were beaten by police with blackjacks and fists and kicked as they lay crumpled on the ground, while being asked if they had picked up a white girl. Afterward, they were taken to the spot where the crime happened. Deputy Yates inspected Shepherd’s shoes, which he had worn the night before. Yates was frustrated to see that the soles did not match footprints in the ground at the scene. Irvin’s were the same, but Irvin admitted that he was wearing a different pair of shoes. The two men were taken to Tavares jail, where they were interrogated in the basement while cuffed to overhead pipes and severely beaten.\n\nCharles Greenlee was a 16-year-old who had come from Gainesville and was trying to find work with his friend Ernest Thomas. Thomas had convinced Greenlee that there were plenty of jobs in Groveland. Greenlee was waiting at a rail depot to meet Thomas when he was arrested and brought to the police station under suspicion. \n\nGreenlee was interrogated and beaten in a cell that night until he admitted to the rape of Norma Padgett. Thomas escaped capture and fled Lake County the following morning. Greenlee admitted to having been with Thomas. \n\nPolice learned where the latter lived and where he was hiding, as they found a letter in his letterbox addressed to his wife. Lake County Sheriff Willis McCall appointed a posse that tracked Thomas down days later, away in Madison County, Florida. He was shot and killed; officers reported that Thomas was armed and reached for his weapon. \n\nThe NAACP later said that the posse had never intended to arrest Thomas, but to kill him. According to the coroner's inquest, Lake County Sheriff McCall was at the scene when Thomas was shot. The coroner’s jury determined that Thomas had been lawfully killed and ruled his death a justifiable homicide.\n\nThe NAACP helped with the men's defense, hiring Orlando attorney Franklin Williams. After interviewing the three surviving suspects, Williams said each had independently stated that he was beaten by Lake County deputies. Shepherd and Greenlee both told FBI agents that they confessed to raping Padgett in order to stop the beatings. Irvin never confessed and maintained his innocence. \n\nWilliams documented the visible evidence of their injuries.Shepherd’s injuries included scars on head, broken teeth, tooth puncture of upper lip, lash scars across back and chest, and scars on the wrist, which supported Shepherd’s claim that he had been cuffed to a metal pipe. Irvin had similar injuries: body scars, wide bruises, lash marks, scars across wrists, and an apparently fractured jaw. Greenlee’s injuries included a red and bruised left eye, scars on the right cheekbone and around the neck and groin, swollen testicles, and numerous cuts on his feet.\n\nThurgood Marshall, the lead lawyer of the NAACP, pressed the Justice Department and the FBI to initiate a civil rights and domestic violence investigation into the beatings. Marshall convinced the Justice Department that the beatings violated the men's rights, and the FBI dispatched agents to investigate. The FBI later concluded that Lake County deputies James Yates and Leroy Campbell had violated the Groveland men's civil rights and urged U.S. Attorney Herbert Phillips of Florida to prosecute, but a grand jury did not return indictments of the deputies.\n\nLikely fearing that a higher court would reverse any guilty verdicts, the prosecution never introduced the coerced confessions as evidence into the trial. \n\nThere is much uncertainty about whether Padgett was raped. The prosecution did not question Dr. Geoffrey, the physician who examined her, on the stand. Judge Truman Futch did not permit the defense to call the doctor as a witness. According to his records, Geoffrey could not tell whether she had been raped. He found no evidence of tears or wounds in the vagina other than the lacerations mentioned above.Laboratory analysis of a vaginal smear revealed no spermatozoa present in the vagina, nor any organisms resembling gonococci, which could have been other evidence of sex. There were no other gross signs of bruises, breaks in the skin or other signs of violence. \n\nShepherd and Irvin said that they had been together drinking in Eatonville, Florida, the night of the alleged attack. Greenlee said he was nowhere near the other defendants on that night and that he had never met Shepherd and Irvin before. \n\nThe defense accused Sheriff McCall's deputies of manufacturing evidence to win a conviction. All three men were convicted by the all-white jury. Shepherd and Irvin were sentenced to death, and Greenlee was sentenced to life, as he was a minor. \n\nThe NAACP took on assisting the defense in appeals. In 1951 Marshall led the defense in an appeals hearing for Irvin and Shepherd at the U.S. Supreme Court. It overturned the convictions of both men based on adverse pre-trial publicity, and remanded the case to the lower court for a new trial. (Greenlee had not appealed his sentence of life imprisonment.)\n\nMcCall was transporting Shepherd and Irvin from Raiford State Prison back to the Lake County jail in Tavares when he claimed to have a flat tire. Alone with the two handcuffed prisoners, McCall pulled down a dirt road to inspect the tire, outside Umatilla, Florida, north of Tavares. He claimed that Shepherd asked to relieve himself, and when the two prisoners, cuffed together, got out of the car, they attacked McCall. He drew his pistol and shot at them. The shooting took place on a dark country road outside the town. He shot each prisoner three times. Shepherd was killed instantly, and Irvin survived by playing dead.\n\nThe following morning, Irvin told FBI agents and reporters at the hospital where he was taken for treatment that the shooting was unprovoked. He said McCall had shot him and Shepherd in cold blood, staging the scene to make it look like an escape attempt. Irvin shocked reporters by saying that Lake County Deputy James Yates had joined McCall at the scene, saw that Irvin was still breathing, and fired one last shot through Irvin's neck. Irvin survived. The FBI later found a bullet buried in the ground beneath Irvin's blood spot that appeared to support his account of the shooting. A nail found in the front wheel of McCall’s car appeared to have caused his claimed \"tire trouble\" that night. McCall said that he had no idea how the nail got there, but the FBI believed that it had been placed there. \n\nAn all-white coroner's jury, made up of many of McCall's friends, took half an hour to find Shepherd’s death justified. They concluded that McCall had been acting in line of duty and in self-defense. McCall was cleared of any wrongdoing. (At this time, most blacks had been disenfranchised by state laws since the turn of the 20th century. They therefore were excluded from any juries in the state, as they were not on any voter rolls).\n\nAfter recovering from his shooting wounds, Irvin was tried again after refusing a deal from the prosecutor and Governor Fuller Warren that would have spared him from a death sentence if he pleaded guilty. His defense counsel, Thurgood Marshall, gained a change of venue to Marion County, Florida, because of the extensive and adverse publicity around the case in Lake County. Marshall led the defense team from the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. Irvin was found guilty. Judge Futch, who was again presiding, sentenced him to death. \n\nAfter LeRoy Collins was elected governor in 1954, questions were raised to him about Irvin's case, because he was considered moderate. He reviewed it and in 1955 commuted Irvin's sentence to life in prison, stating that neither trial proved conclusively that Irvin was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Irvin was paroled in 1968; he died in February 1969 in Lake County.\n\nGreenlee was paroled from prison in 1962. He moved to Nashville, Tennessee with his wife and their daughter Carole, born in 1950. (His wife was pregnant when he was arrested.) They had a son, Thomas, in 1965. Greenlee died on April 18, 2012.\n\nIn 2016, both the city of Groveland and government of Lake County offered posthumous apologies to each of the Groveland Four and their families, and began lobbying state lawmakers to do the same. On Tuesday, April 18, 2017, the Florida House of Representatives unanimously passed a resolution sponsored by State Representative Bobby DuBose apologizing to the families of the Groveland Four, some of whose members were in attendance, and exonerating the men. The Florida State Senate passed an identical resolution sponsored by Senator Gary Farmer on April 27, 2017. The resolutions also called on Governor Rick Scott to expedite the process for granting posthumous pardons.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3208711", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3208711", "title": "High Commissioner on National Minorities", "text": "High Commissioner on National Minorities\n\nCreated on July 8, 1992 by the Helsinki Summit Meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), now known as the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the High Commissioner on National Minorities (HCNM) is charged with identifying and seeking early resolution of ethnic tension that might endanger peace, stability or friendly relations between and within the participating states of the OSCE. The HCNM focuses on the OSCE area and will alert the Organisation where a situation has the potential to develop into a conflict. The Organisation consists of 57 participating States across North America, Europe and Asia. The establishment of the HCNM is generally considered to be a “success story” and a useful instrument of conflict prevention.\n\nThe creation of the office of HCNM was directly related to the political circumstances at the beginning of the 1990s. The Yugoslav Wars were ethnic conflicts that broke out after the collapse of the Berlin Wall and of Communism, and which eventually resulted in the break up of the country. Efforts of the CSCE, European Union and United Nations failed to bring peace. The frustration at being unable to prevent such a devastating human tragedy led to the Netherlands government proposing the post of the HCNM. This office would aim to prevent conflicts based on tensions with ethnic minorities. In regards to the Yugoslav tragedy, international efforts were deemed to have failed because of the limited knowledge of the international mediators of the ethnic situation. This often meant that tensions escalated because the international community did not fully understand the issues at play. Further, any international aid that was provided came too late. It was recognised that such tensions should be identified and addressed as early as possible in order to prevent escalation into endless conflict. The Yugoslav conflict also made clear that many conflicts around the world were rooted in tensions involving national minorities. It was against this background that the proposal for the office of the HCNM was presented.\n\nMany concerns were raised in regards to the model put forward by the Netherlands. As a result, several major restrictions to the HCNM’s role were implemented into the mandate.\n\nStates disagreed on whether the rights of national minorities were individual or group rights. Ultimately, there was a clear exclusion of individual cases through paragraph 5(c) of the HCNM mandate. This prohibits the High Commissioner from considering “violations of CSCE commitments with regard to an individual person belonging to a national minority”. Many states feared that the HCNM would become a sort of \"ombudsman\" for national minorities. The aim of the office was not to create a new human rights instrument, but to create a conflict prevention tool. This was emphasised in the title of the office: the High Commissioner \"on\" National Minorities, not \"for\" National Minorities.\n\nMany states were also highly opposed to involvement by the HCNM in cases of terrorism. As a result, the HCNM was prohibited from considering ‘national minority issues in situations involving organized acts of terrorism’. The international community further decided that the HCNM should not be able to ‘communicate with and (...) acknowledge communications from any person or organization which practices or publicly condones terrorism or violence’. In some instances this clause has become a way for states to ban the HCNM from interfering with their minority problems.\n\nThe HCNM’s mandate as defined at the Helsinki Summit meeting in 1992 contained many ambiguities, the most significant of which is the definition of “national minorities”. No clear guidance was given in the mandate on how to interpret this term. This was largely because the CSCE participating states could not come to an agreement on the definition of \"national minorities\", and therefore opted to provide no definition at all.\n\nThe first High Commissioner, Max van der Stoel, focused on clarifying and defining his mandate. He did this by consulting many experts on minority rights and international law, and thereby developing a set of guidelines and practices for overcoming the ambiguities in the mandate. Through the broadly defined mandate, he was able to approach the role in the best way he saw fit. The approach taken by van der Stoel came to define how his successors approached the role too. His definition of “national minorities” had three different elements. Firstly, a national minority could be distinguished from the rest of society through linguistic, ethnic or cultural characteristics. Secondly, that minority strived to protect and strengthen those characteristics which made up its identity. Finally, he referenced paragraph 32 of the 1990 CSCE Copenhagen Document, which emphasised that being a part of a national minority was a person’s individual choice. In the approach taken by van der Stoel and his successors, there is no requirement that a national minority be a numerical minority in the population. In many cases a national minority will be a majority in certain countries or regions.\n\nThe main role of the HCNM is to identify and address tensions involving national minorities which could develop into a conflict. This involves “early warning” of potential conflict followed by “early action” to dissolve tensions. The mandate authorises the HCNM to assess ‘the role of the parties directly concerned, the nature of the tensions and recent developments therein and, where possible, the potential consequences for peace and stability within the OSCE area’. Her most important role is not necessarily to completely resolve all potential conflicts, but rather to manage them in a way that the tension between groups does not escalate but declines. This involves mediation as well as the introduction of sustainable solutions.\n\nUltimately, the role of the High Commissioner is one of preventative diplomacy. She must provide early warnings of escalating tensions as well as early action to prevent any further escalation. Tensions between different societal groups can arise over a variety of elements, such as ethnicity, religion, or language. The HCNM works to sort through these tensions and towards social cohesion, before those tensions escalate into conflicts. The first HCNM, Max van der Stoel, noted that the HCNM should aim to prevent disputes from arising into armed conflicts, but should also understand that in some cases the situation may go beyond the realm of preventative diplomacy. Where conflicts can only be resolved in the long term, a more comprehensive approach must be taken. This may result in the High Commissioner issuing an early warning notice to the Permanent Council, alongside a request for the OSCE to issue her an ‘ad hoc’ mandate for late prevention of the conflict. An early warning notice under paragraph 15 of the mandate has only been issued once before, in regards to the 1999 Kosovo crisis.\n\nIn order to promote social cohesion, the HCNM must provide advice and take actions that are context specific. Significant research should be undertaken about the specific society and ethnic groups involved in order to effectively respond to the situation. Van der Stoel always prepared extensively for any state involvement, often by organising a one- or two-day workshop with leading experts in several relevant areas. The importance of this approach arose due to the failures of the international community during the Yugoslav Wars, where a lack of understanding about the ethnic situation by international mediators often led to a worsening of the situation.\n\nThe work undertaken by the High Commissioners since the inception of the role is considered to have been largely successful. The role requires expertise, tools and experience in monitoring situations of potential tension, as well as in recognising signs of escalation. Such knowledge and skill is invaluable in regards to conflict prevention involving minorities, because these situations are often very precarious and complex. No inter-ethnic tension is alike, and each will involve different factors and historical and cultural influences. There is therefore a clear need for a dedicated office specialised in and focused on minority issues.\n\nThe HCNM employs several different techniques in order to achieve her purpose of conflict prevention. The High Commissioner works very closely with the particular state involved and with the leaders of the relevant parties. While the HCNM ultimately cannot enforce any compulsory action, there are many ways that the HCNM can assist the situation.\n\nThe High Commissioner will assist in preventing an escalating conflict by introducing a minimum standard of minority rights, which should be upheld by the state and other majority actors. She may also assist in implementing those standards and helping them become the norm in that state. There are seven sets of thematic recommendations that can provide a platform for better inter-ethnic relations and help to reduce tension. These include recommendations on education, linguistic rights, participation, kin-states, policing in multi-ethnic societies, minority languages in broadcast media, and integration and conflict prevention. The HCNM frequently recommends that states take measures to protect minority languages, as this is one of the major causes of inter-ethnic tension. However, the OSCE and HCNM also promote a policy of integration, which strives for a balance between protection of minority culture and the development of an overarching common identity. This involves integration policies such as encouragement to learn the state language. The High Commissioner also promotes education of national minority languages and religious practices as a way to prevent conflict. This is a way to foster an appreciation of diversity among communities and also to dissolve stereotypes about certain ethnic groups.\n\nThe HCNM will also focus on improving communication between the parties involved, including leaders of the state and leaders of the opposing national groups. This involves assisting processes of negotiations and ensuring participation by all relevant parties. When creating the role, it was recognised that the most frequent cause of hostile inter-ethnic relations was insufficient or distorted communication. The HCNM plays an important role in setting up lines of effective communication before hostile relations begin to develop.\n\nIn order to develop a peaceful society the High Commissioner strives to ensure that all minority groups are sufficiently involved in public life, and are fairly represented at national, regional and local levels. By ensuring that minority groups are involved in decision-making processes and that they enjoy some level of influence, states can prevent these groups from becoming marginalised. Active and effective participation also provides remedies for groups who feel their rights are being violated, and in doing so can prevent such groups from seeking remedies in a more violent manner.\n\nImportantly, all governments may exercise a right of refusal against participation of the High Commissioner, and may prevent her from entering the country. In such a circumstance, the HCNM is to inform the OSCE.\n\nThe first HCNM, Max van der Stoel, was involved with inter-ethnic tensions in Ukraine between a substantial Russian minority and the Ukraine government from 1994 to 2001. His work during this time was considered largely successful in reducing tensions and building towards peaceful solutions. This conflict was multi layered and emphasised the importance of finding durable solutions in the search for peace. Following the disintegration of the USSR and Ukrainian independence in 1991, tensions began to arise as Ukraine sought to establish its identity. In particular, these uneasy relations were caused by historical Russian domination over Ukraine, as well as the prevalence of Russian language in Ukrainian life. While the HCNM was not the only influential actor in managing and resolving these issues, he played a critical role in establishing movement towards peace.\n\nThe flexibility of the HCNM’s mandate and the nature of the role allowed van der Stoel to become involved in the tensions in Ukraine at a very early stage. He was able to craft a tactful and creative approach to dealing with the precarious issues that had arisen at that stage. The success of his work there is in large part credited to his ability to build a relationship of trust with the parties involved and to approach all issues from the basis of impartiality.\n\nThe HCNM was invited to Ukraine by the government in February 1994. In Ukraine at that time there were several minority issues that were causing tension. The HCNM was involved in managing the relations between the Russian minority and the Ukrainian majority, the status of Crimea within Ukraine, and resettlement of the Crimean Tatars. Importantly, descent into violent conflict was prevented in all areas. However, while the HCNM’s work was largely successful, it also exposed the limitations of the role. The Ukrainian government was unwilling to implement the majority of his recommendations, even though it was consistently willing to engage with the HCNM. Therefore, while the HCNM ultimately played a critical role in conflict prevention in Ukraine, his ability to secure a sustainable solution across all areas of tension was often limited.\n\n\n\n"}

According to popular belief, all-female juries did not occur until much later. The state of Wyoming claims the first all woman jury was empaneled in Laramie on March 7, 1870. Even after the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was passed in 1920, not all states permitted all female juries.\n\nCatchpole was an indentured servant in the colony of Maryland, arriving there by boat from the Commonwealth of England in January 1656. Upon her arrival she was accused of several crimes, resulting in a trial on September 22, 1656 in the General Provincial Court in Patuxent County, Maryland. This trial was the first to have an all-female jury in colonial Maryland and one of the earliest in colonial America.\n\nCatchpole was accused of murdering her child and of other bizarre acts, by William Bramhall, a fellow passenger on the ship \"Mary and Francis\" and similarly an indentured servant, who had died after making the accusations. He had accused her of killing her child, cutting the throat of a female passenger while the woman was asleep, and stabbing a seaman in the back. Before he died he made known his accusations to other passengers, stating that Catchpole had committed these acts while the other passengers were asleep. No other passengers substantiated these accusations, nor could any account for how Catchpole had hidden a pregnancy during the voyage and given birth on a small ship without others seeing evidence of this. Catchpole claimed she had never been pregnant.\n\nIt was decided that an all-female jury was needed because the issues of pregnancy and birth required female expertise. Composed of seven married women and four single women, the trial was ordered by the General Provincial Court at Patuxent for September 22, 1656. In order to determine if Catchpole had murdered her own infant, the jury was to inspect Catchpole's body to find evidence that she had been pregnant and given birth to a child. The jury inspected Catchpole's body and concluded that she had not recently given birth. Other witnesses gave testimony that the man making the accusations was \"not in sound mind\".\nAdditional hearsay evidence was presented that the male accuser had spoken of witchcraft and told other bizarre stories. He had said that after slitting the woman's throat, she sewed it back up before the woman awoke, and that she rubbed grease on the back of the fatally wounded seaman and he came back to life. \n\nThe jury gave little credence to the charges of witchcraft, and seeing no evidence of childbirth, acquitted Catchpole of all charges.\n\nJudith Catchpole was tried before the first all-woman jury to serve in colonial Maryland. The judicial practices of common law in colonial America often arose from the need to accommodate to practical situations. In the case of Judith Catchpole, the expertise of women was needed to decide whether she had been pregnant and given birth to a child. In general however, women were not allowed to serve on juries in the United States, even after the Nineteenth Amendment was passed in 1920 giving women the right to vote.\n\n"}

Legislation may regulate, or in some cases prohibit the use of dogs to hunt or flush wild animal species.\n\nThe use of scenthounds to track prey dates back to Assyrian, Babylonian and Egyptian times and in England, hunting with Agassaei hounds was popular before the Romans. In more modern times, hunting regulation has been encouraged by the animal welfare and animal rights movements out of concern for wildlife management and alleged cruelty.\n\nNEEDS COMPLETING PLEASE DO IT\n\nHunting with hounds was banned in Germany by Adolf Hitler's government in 1934, before which hunting laws varied from state to state. Hounds were used to pursue deer, wild boar, hares and foxes.\n\nHermann Göring had a passion for shooting game and appointed himself Hunting Master of the Reich (Reichsjaegermeister) soon after the Nazis gained power in 1933. He decided that more order was needed and introduced sweeping legislative changes which were enforced throughout the Reich. The Hunting Law (\"Reichsjagdgesetz\") of 1934 was closely modelled on the Prussian \"Tier- und Pflanzenschutzverordnung\" of 16 December 1929.\n\nHitler's cabinet was told about the hunting regulation at a meeting on July 3, 1934 - the same day that the Fuhrer reported on the ruthless killing of Stormtrooper \"conspirators\" in the \"Night of the Long Knives\", according to an official Nazi biography published four years later. Hitler was a self-declared vegetarian and hated hunting (see Adolf Hitler and vegetarianism).\n\nThe ban on hunting with hounds was unpopular with the aristocracy, many of whom hunted with hounds on horseback. Kaiser Wilhelm II (1859-1941), the grandson of Queen Victoria, who was a keen hunter of the wild boar was powerless to stop the changes as he had abdicated and fled the country in 1918. The remaining upper classes were unable to oppose the totalitarian regime. The Nazi-era ban on hunting with hounds was passed and remains in force to this day. \n\nShooting game remained legal though regulated. The Act included a promise of laws that were designed to give the shooting fraternity a privileged position in the new Reich. The idea was to give every (shooting) hunter his own personal shoot after \"the Third Reich's glorious victory over Europe\".\n\nHunting of wild mammals in the traditional style is banned by the Hunting Act 2004. Earlier acts, such as the Protection of Animals Act 1911, the Protection of Badgers Act 1992 and the Wild Mammals (Protection) Act 1996 contained specific exemptions for hunting activities.\n\nIn February 2002 the Scottish Parliament voted by eighty three to thirty six to pass legislation to ban hunting with hounds. MSPs decided not to give compensation to those whose livelihoods or businesses might suffer as a result of the ban. The Act came into effect on August 1, 2002. An article in the Guardian on 9 September 2004 reports that of the ten Scottish hunts, nine survived the ban, using the permitted exemption allowing them to use packs of hounds to flush foxes to guns.\n\nA number of convictions have taken place under the Act, two for people hunting foxes and ten for hare coursing. The only prosecution of a traditional mounted hunt led to a not guilty verdict, but to a clarification of the law, with the sheriff saying that the activity of flushing foxes to guns \"will require to be accompanied by realistic and one would expect, effective arrangements for the shooting of pest species. The use of what might be termed \"token guns\" or what was described by the Crown as paying lip service to the legislation is not available ... as a justification for the continuation of what was referred to in the evidence before me as traditional foxhunting.\" \n\nCurrently fox hunting takes place in Scotland as described in the Scotsman's article. There are eleven hunts in Scotland where the rules are more relaxed The continuation of the stricter laws in England and Wales has been guaranteed by the Scottish National Party. There is currently no planned legislation to tighten the rules on the Scottish hunts giving the Scottish industry the advantage \n\nFox hunting in Northern Ireland would have been banned had the Foster Bill become law. However, by the time of subsequent hunting legislation in the House of Commons, the Northern Ireland Assembly had been established and the hunting issue had been devolved to that body. A Hunting Bill was introduced into the Northern Ireland Assembly but rejected in December 2010.\n\nIn the United States federal system, the agency primarily responsible for wildlife management is the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, a division of the United States Department of the Interior, a cabinet-level division, whose director reports directly to the president. Within these federal guidelines, most hunting regulation for non-migratory species rests within wildlife or agricultural departments at the state level. With fifty different states, this lends itself to a wide variety of diversity, especially for an activity such as fox hunting. Much more common than organised fox hunting is the hunting (usually by private individuals) of raccoons (\"Ursus lotor\") with coonhounds, and where such hunting is practised, the two are often regulated similarly due to the method (which involves tracking or active pursuit by dogs).\n\nThe red fox is protected in every state in which it is present (all except Hawaii), in contrast to its status as vermin in the UK. It is variously classified as a furbearer, small game or predator in state hunting and trapping regulations. The open and closed hunting seasons for fox (both red and gray) also vary by state. Pursuit of red fox while in possession of a firearm requires a hunting license (or in some cases a trapping license) in all states, and is generally restricted to a specific season (typically the winter months). In some states (such as Florida) it is illegal to chase fox with dogs while in possession of a firearm, although it is legal to chase them otherwise.\n\nIn some western states the coyote is an unprotected species, and there are no restrictions on the methods used in hunting them. In these areas Hunt Clubs often pursue coyote instead of fox.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "50885003", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50885003", "title": "MSG Western New York", "text": "MSG Western New York\n\nMSG Western New York (MSG WNY) is an American regional sports network that is a joint venture between MSG Networks and Pegula Sports and Entertainment. The channel (also on occasion credited as \"Pegula Sports Network\" or \"MSG Buffalo\") is a sub-feed of MSG Network, with programming oriented towards the Western New York region, including coverage of the National Hockey League's Buffalo Sabres and the National Football League's Buffalo Bills. It replaced MSG Network on television providers in the Sabres' media market in 2016.\n\nMSG Western New York is available on cable providers throughout Western New York. Most programming is available nationwide on satellite via DirecTV, with Sabres games requiring an NHL Center Ice subscription for out of market viewers; select programs are carried in Canada's Niagara Peninsula on a special channel set up for Bell TV subscribers that was founded in 2013.\n\nAfter the collapse of Empire Sports Network and its parent Adelphia, MSG bought the rights to the Buffalo Sabres in 2006 under a 10-year deal; where telecasts are controlled by the team via the Sabres Hockey Network, including the sale of advertising, and the simulcast of Rick Jeanneret's commentary on both radio and television (although, during the 2015-16 season, the team experimented with having separate commentary teams on radio and television for selected games, which the \"Buffalo News\" speculated was in preparation for Jeanneret's eventual retirement), conditions that the Sabres always make as part of their telecast deals going back to the days of Empire. After acquiring the rights, MSG divided its network into three regional broadcast \"zones\"; Sabres games were available within \"Zone 3\", which covered Buffalo and Rochester, and \"Zone 2\", the remainder of the state excluding Buffalo, Rochester, and New York City—which was shared by the Sabres, Devils, Islanders, and Rangers. The exact channel assignment for Sabres games varied by region (some games were carried by FSN New York in Zone 2), but all games were carried on the main MSG Network service within Zone 3.\n\nThe Buffalo Sabres' regional television ratings are among the highest in the league; in the 2015-16 season, despite the team's poor overall performance, fan enthusiasm over star prospect Jack Eichel helped the team achieve the highest average regional viewership of all NHL teams for the first time since 2008-09, with a 6.55 share. National telecasts on NBC and NBCSN have also had notably high ratings in Buffalo.\n\nIt was speculated that Pegula Sports and Entertainment, which had recently bought the Sabres, Rochester Americans, Buffalo Bandits and Buffalo Bills, was planning to take advantage of the high viewership by establishing a team-owned regional sports network once the Sabres' existing television contract with MSG expired. The \"Buffalo News\"s Alan Pergament also acknowledged the impending end of the Sabres and Bills' radio contracts with WGR as a possibility that the group could, potentially, acquire a radio station to serve as a team-owned radio outlet if it is unable to renew its contract with Entercom (Entercom had purchased the Sabres' previous owned-and-operated station, 107.7 WNSA, in 2004, and merged its remaining programming onto WGR). Pegula eventually secured a contract extension with Entercom keeping the Bills and Sabres on WGR through the spring of 2021. However, in regards to television, he felt that it was more likely for Pegula to partner with MSG to form a full-time, Buffalo-specific feed of MSG Network with additional local programming, rather than actually establishing a new, standalone outlet.\n\nOn June 20, 2016, Pegula announced that it had entered into a joint venture with MSG to establish a new service known as MSG Western New York. The channel, a sub-feed of MSG Network took over the former MSG Zone 3/Sabres game only channel, replacing the parent channel within the Sabres existing television market—which was also, notably, expanded to include the entirety of Rochester. The arrangement allows Pegula access to MSG's existing distribution and statewide programming, while allowing opt-outs for an expanded slate of local programming dedicated to the Bills and Sabres, which is produced and controlled by Pegula. MSG as part of the agreement pays $19 to $20 million per-year in rights fees to broadcast Sabres games and programming, as well as Buffalo Bills programming; it is nearly double the value of the previous Sabres deal. As with the previous deal, Pegula controls team programming on the network, including advertising sales and production (which is handled through PSE's production wing PicSix Creative), and receives all advertising revenue, while MSG collects the retransmission consent fee. Besides original programming and broadcasts exclusive to MSG WNY, the network also carries selected programming from the main MSG Network channel.\n\nPegula's executive vice president of media and content Mark Preisler explained that the deal was an alternative to establishing a new regional sports network from scratch, as the company would be able to expand on its relationship with MSG as a long-standing partner by leveraging its infrastructure and distribution, rather than needing to invest in building a network and negotiating carriage with television providers.\n\nThe first promos seen for the channel ran during a Bills preseason game against the Indianapolis Colts on August 13, 2016 promoting its Bills programming. The channel debuted on September 10, 2016 at 8:00pm with a Western New York cut in showing the 2016 debut of \"The Rex Ryan Show\" and a special behind the scenes feature called \"Rex and Rob Reunited\" at 8:30 and 9pm, the daily feed followed on October 3.\n\nOn April 4, 2017, news broke that James L. Dolan, controlling owner of MSG, was exploring the sale of his regional sports networks, including his share of MSG Western New York.\n\nThe network carries team programming related to the Buffalo Sabres and Buffalo Bills; the former including all 70 regional Sabres games and the latter including local Bills shows formerly aired by WKBW-TV; preseason telecasts began to be simulcast with WKBW beginning in 2017. In addition, the channel simulcasts \"The Instigators\" (formerly known as \"Sabres Hockey Hotline\") and \"One Bills Live\" (formerly known as \"The John Murphy Show\") from WGR radio as part of a five-hour weekday block, originating from studios (dubbed the \"One Buffalo studios\") at New Era Field; Murphy's program was moved from the evening to the afternoon and had a co-host added. As an aspect of the overall deal, PSE agreed in principle to extend its radio rights with WGR.\n\nMSG Western New York added a package of five Rochester Americans contests beginning in December 2016, moving the team's television broadcasts to MSG WNY from the moribund Time Warner Cable Sports Channel. On September 7, 2017, it was announced that the channel would begin airing select Monsignor Martin Athletic Association high school football games produced by Pegula as part of a multi-year deal, including a three-game showcase at New Era FIeld. The high school coverage moved exclusively online for 2018. Other programs will be added as the channel expands. The remainder of MSG WNY's schedule consists of programming from the main MSG Network schedule, such as New York Knicks basketball. In turn, MSG also has rights to air the Pegula-produced original programming and game converge on its other networks.\n\nIn 2018, MSG-produced Bills preseason telecasts moved to the stations of Nexstar Media Group in all media markets outside Buffalo. As the Bills could not break their existing contract with WKBW in Buffalo, the rights in that city will not change until 2020, when Nexstar-owned WIVB-TV will begin carrying the games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth of the two primary cable providers in Western New York, Spectrum (formerly Time Warner Cable, which covers the vast majority of the state) and Atlantic Broadband (which covers a small portion of Cattaraugus County) have carried the network from its inception.\n\nOn August 10, 2016, the debut night of MSG Western New York it was revealed that DirecTV would not be running the network's full programming schedule. The Sabres noted that MSG made the programming available to DirecTV but the provider was not willing to carry it. This made MSG WNY a part-time channel on DirecTV with the provider continuing to air the channel as a game only service showing Sabres games only. For the 2017 NFL season, DirecTV began showing \"Bills All Acesss\" and irregularly showing the first runs of \"The Sean McDermott Show\" and \"Bills Tonight\" in addition to the Sabres games that the channel airs. A week later DirecTV began showing \"The Instigators\" and \"The John Murphy Show\". DirecTV happens to be the service that Pegula owned properties like 716 Food and Sport, a sports bar and grill in downtown Buffalo use.\n\nMSG Western New York, like MSG and MSG Plus, is unavailable on Dish Network. As part of an ongoing feud with the family of Charles Dolan (owners of MSG), Dish has not carried any MSG network channel since the last agreement expired on October 1, 2010.\n\nFuboTV added the MSG networks for the fall 2017 season.\n\n"}

Senate Bill 454 was:\n\nOn April 3, 1971, Senate Bill 454 received a 33–3 vote by the Maryland Senate, and on April 10, 1971, it received a 78–39 vote by the Maryland House of Delegates. On April 28, 1971, Governor Martin Mantel (June 7, 1972 – June 6, 1973) approved Senate Bill 454. Subsequently, Section 3 of Article 27A took effect in the Annotated Code of Maryland on July 1, 1971, and the remainder of Article 27A went into effect on January 1, 1972.\n\nSection 3 of Article 27A went into effect as the first stage of law concerning the Office of the Public Defender for Maryland. It decreed that the Office of the Public Defender is part of Maryland’s Executive Branch of government, and provided that a Public Defender shall be appointed head of the Office by the Board of Trustees. Furthermore, it stated that the public defender shall seek the approval of the board of trustees per the appointment of a deputy director, and likewise with the appointment of district public defenders for each of the twelve districts. Section 3 follows that the Public Defender shall seek the advice of district public defenders in the course of appointing assistant public defenders for a respective district.\n\nPursuant Section 3 of Article 27, to be qualified as Public Defender, a person must be an attorney-at-law, having been admitted to practice law in the State of Maryland by the Court of Appeals of Maryland, by which he or she has been engaged in the practice of law for at least five years prior to appointment. A person seeking appointment to deputy public defender must satisfy the same criteria. Assistant public defenders are qualified for appointment after establishment that he or she is an attorney-at-law as confirmed by admittance to practice law in the State of Maryland by the Court of Appeals of Maryland.\n\nThe remainder of Section 3, Article 27A pertains to the Public Defender’s use of the budget in that it shall provide suitable offices within the state with at least one office in each district, and that all employees including personnel such as investigators, stenographers, clerical assistants and other staff shall be provided a salary appropriated by the executive budget for the Office of the Public Defender.\n\nAt the time when Article 27A was enacted, it followed immediately after Article 27 of the Annotated Code, which is titled: “Crimes and Punishments”. On the first day of the 2008 Regular Session of the Maryland General Assembly (January 9, 2008 to April 7, 2008), Senate Bill 37 was introduced and subsequently on April 8, 2008, Article 27A (sections 1-14) was repealed in entirety and underwent a code revision as “Chapter 15, Acts of 2008, Criminal Procedure Article, Title 16. Office of the Public Defender”, which is codified in the most current version (red books) of the Maryland Annotated Code. \nThe 2008 code revision of Article 27A was a milestone in a forty-year effort to revise the Maryland Annotated Code. “Chapter 15, Acts of 2008, Criminal Procedure Article, Title 16. Office of the Public Defender” was part of the revision process that won't end until every articles in the black books (cited by an article and section number) undergo a transition to the new red books (cited by article name and number) of the Maryland Annotated Code.\n\nThe purpose of Senate Bill 97, which was introduced in the 2010 Maryland General Assembly Session (January 13, 2010 – April 12, 2010), was to implement substantive changes to Chapter 15, Acts of 2008, Criminal Procedure Article, Title 16 (2008 code revision).\n\nSenate Bill 97 was signed by Governor Martin O’Malley on May 4, 2010 (as chapter 223) and became effective on June 1, 2010. It affected sections 16-203 “Office Personnel” and 16-301 “Board of Trustees\". House Bill 122 was identical to Senate Bill 97, and it was signed (as chapter 224) and went into effect on the same days as Senate Bill 97. The third substantive change to Chapter 15, Acts of 2008, Criminal Procedure Article, Title 16 began with House Bill 121 which was signed on May 1, 2010 (as chapter 393) and went into effect June 1, 2010. It affected section 16-210 “Eligibility for Service”.\n\nThe Maryland Office of the Public Defender (OPD) is an independent agency of the Executive Branch of Maryland.

The remaining 1.3% occurs due the following reasons: in cases of rape, 0.3%; in cases of incest, 0.03%; in cases of risk to maternal life, 0.1%; in cases of risk to maternal health, 0.8%; and in cases of fetal health issues, 0.5%” As a result of majority of abortions are planned, abortion is becoming a factor for disagreement and lawsuit between partners.\n\nRoman law allowed induced abortions but regulated it in consideration of the biological father. Emperor Septimius Severus ruled circa 211 AD that a woman who had an abortion without consent from her husband should face exile for having bereaved her husband of children.\n\nIn his speech \"Pro Cluentio\", delivered in 66 BC, Cicero refers to a case he had heard of in which a woman from Miletus was sentenced to death for having aborted her pregnancy, upon receiving bribes from those who stood to inherit her husband's estate if he produced no heir. Cicero said that in doing so she had \"destroyed the hope of the father, the memory of his name, the supply of his race, the heir of his family, a citizen intended for the use of the republic\".\n\nA 4th century BC Greek writer from Alexandria, Egypt, Sopater, quoted the lawyer Lysias, who had referred to a trial in Athens in which a man named Antigene accused his wife of having deprived him of a son by having an abortion.\n\nWhether a male has a legal right to advance his personal interest, whether it be toward abortion, fatherhood, or adoption, over that of the female, differs by region.\n\nIn 2011, it was reported that Indonesia, Malawi, Syria, United Arab Emirates, Equatorial Guinea, Kuwait, Maldives, Morocco, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Taiwan and Turkey all had laws which required that an abortion first be authorized by the woman's husband. However, in some countries, this stipulation could be bypassed or overridden if there is genuine concern for maternal health.\n\nSince \"Roe v. Wade\", some states in the United States have attempted to enact laws requiring spousal consent. All of these laws have been ruled unconstitutional, spousal consent in the 1976 decision \"Planned Parenthood v. Danforth\" and spousal awareness in the 1992 decision \"Planned Parenthood v. Casey\n\nIn China the husband of a woman who had an abortion filed a lawsuit against her in 2002 under a law intended to grant sexual equality in terms of childbearing and contraceptive decisions. The law stated that a woman has no overriding priority over her spouse in deciding whether to have a child.\n\nA number of legal cases have arisen in the Western world in which men have tried to prevent women with whom they had been sexually active from obtaining an abortion, all of which failed:\n\n\nAbout men deciding to decline parenthood in the event of an unintended pregnancy and asking for a financial abortion:\n\nThose who support a man's right to intervene in a woman's reproductive decisions, argue that it is unreasonable that, after fertilisation has occurred, women are often given more options with regard to pregnancy and parenthood than men. Armin Brott has said of this, \"A woman can legally deprive a man of his right to become a parent or force him to become one against his will\".\n\nMen's rights and fathers' rights activists have argued that men should have veto power over their partners' decisions to abort. Similarly, philosopher George W. Harris has written that, if a man impregnates a woman with the explicit goal of having a child, in a manner that is mutually consensual, then it would be morally unacceptable for that woman to later have an abortion.\n\nThose who object to men having a right to direct involvement argue that because it is the woman's body carrying the unborn baby, her determination for or against abortion should be the only one. Marsha Garrison, a professor at Brooklyn Law School, stated that U.S. courts acknowledge \"that embryo is in the woman's body, it is within her and can't be separated from her, so it's not just her decision-making about whether to bear a child, it's about her body\".\n\nA 2002 United States Gallup special report mentions only 38% of the population being opposed to notifying the husband of a married woman for an abortion. In a 2003 Gallup poll, 72% of respondents were in favor of notification to the husband, with 26% opposed; of those polled, 79% of males and 67% of females responded in favor of notification inside married couples.\n\nBioethicist Jacob Appel has asked, “if one grants a man veto power over a woman’s choice to have an abortion in cases where he is willing to pay for the child, why not grant him the right to demand an abortion where he is unwilling to provide for the child?\"\n\nIn reference to cases in which men who do not desire to become fathers have been required to pay child support, Melanie McCulley, a South Carolina attorney, in her 1998 article, \"The Male Abortion: The Putative Father's Right to Terminate His Interests in and Obligations to the Unborn Child,\" set forth the theory of the \"male abortion,\" in which she argues that men should be able to terminate their legal obligations to unwanted children.\n\nIt is also possible, rather than taking the stance that males should have the freedom to opt out of inherent responsibilities and rights, to take the stance that one must opt-in and agree to undertake those responsibilities to be compelled to follow them, and only through doing so, earn parental rights. This is what occurs during adoption.\n\n"}

{"id": "35304049", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35304049", "title": "RACER Trust", "text": "RACER Trust\n\nThe Revitalizing Auto Communities Environmental Response Trust (\"RACER Trust\" or \"RACER\") Trust was created in March 2011 by a Settlement Agreement in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. RACER’s mission is to clean up and position for redevelopment properties and other facilities owned by the former General Motors Corporation (“GMC”, “Old GM”) before its Chapter 11 reorganization. Its predecessor, Motors Liquidation Company (\"MLC\") was created to manage and hold the assets of Old GM before the bankruptcy was complete. MLC was carved into four separate trusts; the first to settle the claims of unsecured creditors (), the second (RACER) to handle environmental response for MLC's remaining assets, a third to handle present and future asbestos-related claims, and a fourth for litigation claims.\n\nAt its inception, RACER’s portfolio included properties at 89 locations in 14 states, comprising 358 individual parcels and more than 7,000 acres of primarily industrial land, making RACER one of the largest holders of industrial property in the United States. When it was formed, RACER was the largest environmental response and remediation trust in U.S. history.\n\nRACER is headquartered in Detroit, Michigan. Its administrative trustee is Elliott P. Laws, a former assistant administrator for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and a partner in the law firm Crowell & Moring. The Bankruptcy Court appointed Mr. Laws to a five-year term as administrative trustee when RACER was established in 2011. He was reappointed to a second five-year term in 2016.\n\nThe Settlement Agreement assigns RACER three basic roles regarding former GM properties. First, for those properties with environmental issues, RACER manages and funds the environmental cleanup. Second, RACER manages the properties while they are owned by RACER. Third, RACER has authority to “try to sell or transfer [its] Properties ... with the objective they be put to productive or beneficial use.”\nRACER is not a government entity but rather an independent trust.\n\nOn June 1, 2009, General Motors Corporation and three wholly owned direct or indirect subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11, Title 11 of the United States Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. On October 9, 2009, Remediation and Liability Management Company, Inc. (“REALM”) and Environmental Corporate Remediation Company, Inc. (“ENCORE”) each filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 in the Bankruptcy Court.\n\nOn July 5, 2009, the Bankruptcy Court approved the sale of assets, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 363, to NGMCO, Inc. (“Newco”), now known as General Motors Company (“New GM”). Following the sale of assets, General Motors Corporation was renamed Motors Liquidation Company\n(“MLC”). As part of the sale of assets, GMC excluded from the sale certain real property and personal property it owned. On March 31, 2011, these excluded properties were transferred to the newly formed RACER Trust.\n\nParties to the Environmental Response Trust Consent Decree and Settlement Agreement (Case No. 09-50026 [REG]) included MLC, REALM, and ENCORE (collectively the “debtors”); the United States of America; the states of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin; the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection; and the Department of Environmental Protection for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (collectively the “States”); the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe; and EPLET, LLC, not individually but solely in its representative capacity as Administrative Trustee of RACER Trust.\n\nWhen GMC was renamed as MLC, its portfolio included properties at 89 locations in 14 U.S. states. These properties totaled more than 7,100 acres of land and nearly 40 million square feet of structural area. At the time MLC’s assets were transferred to RACER Trust, MLC had sold six properties outright and a portion of a seventh. While RACER Trust was conveyed the remaining properties, it was transferred the environmental cleanup and monitoring responsibilities of all properties that required environmental remediation and long-term monitoring, regardless of whether the property had changed ownership. Sixty of the properties carried environmental obligations, four of which were sold or partially sold by MLC prior to RACER Trust’s creation.\n\nRACER begins the redevelopment process for new job-creating uses by meeting with local elected officials, community leaders and economic development organizations, with a goal of understanding the local community's common vision for the optimal re-use of each location. Based on this common vision, RACER determines how best to market the property for sale to prospective buyers. Following these initial steps, RACER published detailed marketing brochures and documents describing the terms for purchase, formally opening the marketing process.\n\nOffers for purchase are evaluated by RACER against six criteria set forth in the Settlement Agreement that resulted in RACER’s creation. RACER also may consider additional factors, in its sole discretion, when assessing whether these criteria have been best satisfied by a particular offer. While purchase price will be evaluated, RACER also must consider each offer's ability to create jobs and generate new economic opportunity in the communities hurt by the GM bankruptcy.\n\nRACER strongly prefers buyers who have a specific plan to create new jobs in those properties while reusing, improving and expanding existing buildings, rather than buyers who intend to dismantle buildings and sell components of the properties they have purchased.\n\nProceeds from property sales or leases are used to pay so-called holding costs at RACER sites, including the property taxes RACER pays on these properties, and maintenance, insurance and security expenses. Proceeds from the sale or lease of RACER properties are transferred to RACER’s Administrative Funding Account, from which RACER pays its day-to-day expenses. RACER is self-sustaining, and the anticipated proceeds from the sale or lease of properties were factored into the ongoing operations of RACER at the time of its creation. Thus, donation of property as a redevelopment strategy is precluded.\n\nRACER does not invest directly in redevelopment (for example, by providing funding to offset infrastructure improvement costs) or otherwise pay third-party expenses (for example, for consultants to evaluate redevelopment proposals). RACER invests in local communities by maintaining properties in a marketable condition, paying property taxes and acting as an economic development partner in pursuit of new investment and job creation.\n\nRACER is obligated by terms of the Settlement Agreement to sell its properties at prices that approximate fair market value and that take into consideration the jobs and other economic benefits new projects can bring to auto communities hurt by the GM bankruptcy.\n\nThe Settlement Agreement described the criteria that RACER, at a minimum, must consider when selling properties. These criteria include:\n1. Whether the purchase price is sufficient;\n2. The potential for job creation in the affected community and the state;\n3. Increases in tax revenue or other benefits, like the reduction of blight, to the community, state or Tribe;\n4. Avoiding an unanticipated increase in costs for the environmental cleanup;\n5. The views of the local communities, the Tribe or the state; and,\n6. The reputation and credibility of the prospective purchaser.\nThe Settlement Agreement does not require any particular weighting of the factors. Although the effects of a proposed sale on the states and localities are to be considered — and are considered — by RACER, these entities are not beneficiaries of RACER. Its sole beneficiary is the United States Government.\n\nRACER Trust is responsible for conducting safe, effective cleanups of legacy environmental contamination resulting from previous operations at 60 former GM locations. The cleanups are conducted with the approval and oversight of state and federal regulatory agencies and funded by the principal and investment income from nearly $500 million that RACER received from the U.S. Department of the Treasury at the time of RACER’s establishment. RACER’s goal is to obtain \"No Further Action\" letters or other such instruments of completion from responsible regulatory agencies for all locations where cleanups were required.\n\nTo the extent possible, RACER coordinates its cleanups to accommodate the interests of buyers or end users who seek to invest in new industrial or commercial development and job creation. In most cases, RACER properties can be sold for new uses even before environmental cleanups are started or completed, assuming RACER is guaranteed continuing access to the properties to conduct cleanup work.\n\nBudgets for each cleanup were incorporated into the Settlement Agreement that established RACER Trust. In cases where the established budget is insufficient, RACER Trust has access to supplemental funding with the approval of the signatories to the Settlement Agreement.\n\nRACER sold two of its properties, Moraine Industrial Land and Moraine Assembly Plant, to Industrial Realty Group (IRG) in June 2011. The adjacent sites totaled more than 3.3 million square feet of factory space on 379 acres of land in Moraine and Kettering, Ohio. In one of the largest international deals in Ohio’s history, Fuyao Glass America purchased 1.5 million square feet of manufacturing space from IRG. The company, now the largest auto glass manufacturer in the world, supplies customers such as General Motors, Ford, and Honda. The plant also serves after-market glass suppliers, which includes companies such as Safelite AutoGlass.\n\nFuyao originally pledged $230 million in investment and the creation of 800 jobs. One year later this jumped to $360 million in investment and 1,550 jobs. One year after that, Fuyao announced its labor need had risen to a total of 2,400 workers at this facility. A total of 622 temporary construction jobs also were created. In July 2016, Fuyao announced it is leasing an additional 241,000 square feet of the plant in a 15-year agreement with IRG. Fuyao’s chairman, Cho Tak Wong, said it expects to have more than 3,000 employees at this site sometime in the future. IRG leases portions of the sites to other auto- and non-auto related manufacturers.\n\nIn September 2013, RACER sold its 74-acre Kansas City, Kansas holdings to NorthPoint Development. The buyer named the site Central Industrial Park and prepared it for new industrial development. In 2015, NorthPoint developed a 74,000 square-foot, $10 million build-to-suit facility that was purchased by Plastic Omnium Auto Inergy, which manufactures plastic fuel tank systems for the nearby General Motors Fairfax Assembly Plant. The manufacturer employs approximately 200 new workers. NorthPoint then constructed an 842,000 square-foot speculative building that General Motors Company occupies under a long-term lease. This $55 million project is expected to employ approximately 500 new workers. Additional areas of the site are planned for redevelopment.\n\nIn August 2014, RACER sold two of its Pontiac, Michigan properties, PCC Validation I and PCC Validation II, to M1 Concourse, LLC. The two adjacent sites comprised 86 acres of vacant land once owned by the Rapid Motor Vehicle Company until being acquired by Old GM in 1909. The buyer built an exclusive community of more than 250 secure private garages set along the 1.5-mile Champion Motor Speedway, also part of the M1 Concourse development. Private garages are individually owned flexible storage and entertainment spaces. A 6,000 square-foot entertainment venue, a restaurant and banquet/event center, and commercial/retail spaces were part of the nearly $70 million investment.\n\nRACER sold its 103-acre Indianapolis Stamping Plant site in Indianapolis, Indiana to the Ambrose Property Group in March 2018. The property was once home to the 2.2-million square-foot General Motors Indianapolis Metals Center. RACER razed the vast majority of the structures on site prior to selling to Ambrose. Ambrose’s site plan includes a mixed-use development along the White River that could require some 1,000 temporary construction jobs, 900 permanent jobs, and more than $500 million in project investments over 10 to 15 years.\n\nRACER sold its Delco Chassis site in Livonia, Michigan to Ashley Capital in August 2015. The buyer built a 1-million square-foot facility that it leases to Amazon.com as a fulfillment center. Over 500 temporary construction jobs were created, and in the summer of 2017, Amazon estimated it would hire more than 1,000 employees to staff the facility. Ashley Capital sold a portion of the same site to National Republic Distributing Corporation. The wine and spirits distributer is building a 515,000 square-foot development that will serve as both a regional headquarters and a logistics facility. It is estimated that the company will invest over $67 million in the project and need to hire 525 employees.\n\nIn November 2016, RACER sold 312 acres of its iconic Willow Run Powertrain Plant to a partnership that has redeveloped the property into the American Center for Mobility, a state-of-the-art, four-season testing facility for connected and automated vehicles in Ypsilanti Township, Michigan. The facility includes a 2.5-mile test track with ramps, a 700-degree tunnel, and other components necessary to developing and marketing driverless automobiles and related technologies.\n\nPrior to this sale, RACER sold 144,000 square feet of former manufacturing space on almost 17 acres of this property for the newly relocated Yankee Air Museum, which suffered a devastating fire at its previous location in 2004.\n\nOld GM owned a single property in Virginia, located near Fredericksburg in Spotsylvania County, which RACER took possession of as part of Old GM’s bankruptcy. The 265,000 square-foot manufacturing facility and 76 acres of land were sold by RACER to idX Corporation in May 2017. idX stated in late 2017 that it will hire 175 employees and invest $9.8 million in its project.\n\nRACER Trust self-publishes case studies describing the redevelopment, reuse and environmental status of its former properties from time to time.\n\nIn August 2012, RACER announced it had reached agreement with the Brownfield Communities Development Company, a joint venture between Hilco Trading LLC and The Adler Group, for the sale of the former GM Ontario Stamping Plant, a 2.5-million-square-foot manufacturing facility in Ontario, Ohio. The sale was completed in December 2012. \"We are taking an obsolete single-tenant facility and turning it into a modern multi-tenant business generator,” said Michael M. Adler, CEO and Chairman of Adler Group. \"We are excited to start the next phase of the project and we are looking forward to working with the community.\" The company promised to create 500 jobs within five years or pay a $1 million fine to the city.\n\nBrownfield Communities Development Company represented to RACER and to the community in a Development Agreement dated August 16, 2012, that it intended to seek new tenants to occupy most of the intact building. In a letter dated April 12, 2013, Michael M. Adler, president of Ontario Business Park LLC, requested approval from the City of Ontario for demolition of the buildings on the property. The request was approved by the Ontario City Council and the buildings were demolished and sold for scrap.\n\nBrownfield Communities Development Company claimed that its marketing of the property was thwarted by ongoing environmental activity at the property, despite never having raised the environmental conditions as a potential impediment when purchasing the property and despite ample examples of RACER properties that were purchased and redeveloped while environmental activities were ongoing. The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, the regulatory agency that oversaw RACER’s cleanup activities at the property, issued a Covenant Not to Sue to RACER in April 2016, certifying the completion of environmental cleanup at the property.\n\nIn August 2017, the Ontario City Council sent a notice of default of completion to the Adler Group, Inc. The property remains undeveloped.\n\nIn January 2013, RACER and Elio Motors announced that Elio Motors would purchase the former Shreveport Assembly Plant in Caddo Parish, LA, just outside Shreveport, and hire 1,500 people to manufacture the company’s innovative three-wheel, gas-powered vehicles. The deal was restructured to enable purchase of the facility by the Caddo Parish Industrial Development Board (IDB) in December 2013, with a master lease provided to Industrial Realty Group (dba Shreveport Business Park) and a secondary lease provided to Elio Motors. Shreveport Business Park, in addition to making monthly lease payments to the IDB, is responsible for all of the property’s marketing, maintenance and upkeep.\n\nLocal elected officials who initially were supportive of Elio Motors began to publicly criticize the deal as Elio Motors continued to miss start-of-production targets, citing lack of capital. In particular, Caddo Commissioner Matthew Linn and Louisiana State Rep. Cedric Glover, a prominent supporter of Elio Motors during his time as mayor of Shreveport, levied false allegations — Commissioner Linn that RACER threatened to demolish the plant if the Caddo Parish IDB did not purchase it, and Rep. Glover that the sale of the plant prevented other prospects from leasing or purchasing the plant. Rep. Glover sponsored a House resolution requesting “the House Committee on Commerce to study the state of the automotive manufacturing industry in the state of Louisiana since the onset of the most recent worldwide economic downturn.”\n\nThe House Committee on Commerce convened a hearing on the transaction on October 26, 2016, in Shreveport. The committee issued a two-page report that included no conclusions or finding of fact, except to note that, “Since the October 2016 meeting, officials with the North Louisiana Economic partnership announced that GLOVIS America, a subsidiary of Hyundai, will open a new distribution center in the former General Motors facility that will result in the production of 75,000 vehicles annually and the creation of 400 new positions in north Louisiana.”\n\nIn 2017, the Louisiana House authorized the creation of a subcommittee of the House Committee on Commerce “to further examine certain matters relative to the (RACER Trust’s) fulfillment of fiduciary duties concerning the former General Motors Shreveport plant.” A report of the subcommittee was due 30 days before the start of the 2018 Regular Session of the Legislature of Louisiana. No report was issued.\n\n"}

Others have introduced strict restrictions and some have licensed devices as medicines such as in the UK. , around two thirds of major nations have regulated e-cigarettes in some way. Because of the potential relationship with tobacco laws and medical drug policies, e-cigarette legislation is being debated in many countries. The companies that make e-cigarettes have been pushing for laws that support their interests. In 2016 the US Department of Transportation banned the use of e-cigarettes on commercial flights. This regulation applies to all flights to and from the US.\n\nThe legal status of e-cigarettes is currently pending in many countries. Many countries such as Brazil, Singapore, the Seychelles, and Uruguay have banned e-cigarettes. In Canada, they are technically illegal to sell, as no nicotine-containing e-cigarette is approved by Health Canada, but this is generally unenforced and they are commonly available for sale Canada-wide. In the US and the UK, the use and sale to adults of e-cigarettes are legal. As of August 8, 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) extended its regulatory power to include e-cigarettes. Under this ruling the FDA will evaluate certain issues, including ingredients, product features and health risks, as well their appeal to minors and non-users. The FDA rule also bans access to minors. A photo ID is required to buy e-cigarettes, and their sale in all-ages vending machines is not permitted. In May 2016 the FDA used its authority under the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act to deem e-cigarette devices and e-liquids to be tobacco products, which meant it intended to regulate the marketing, labelling, and manufacture of devices and liquids; vape shops that mix e-liquids or make or modify devices were considered manufacturing sites that needed to register with FDA and comply with good manufacturing practice regulation. E-cigarette and tobacco companies have recruited lobbyists in an effort to prevent the FDA from evaluating e-cigarette products or banning existing products already on the market.\n\nIn February 2014 the European Parliament passed regulations requiring standardization and quality control for liquids and vaporizers, disclosure of ingredients in liquids, and child-proofing and tamper-proofing for liquid packaging. In April 2014 the FDA published proposed regulations for e-cigarettes. In the US some states tax e-cigarettes as tobacco products, and some state and regional governments have broadened their indoor smoking bans to include e-cigarettes. As of 9 October 2015, at least 48 states and 2 territories banned e-cigarette sales to minors.\n\nE-cigarettes have been listed as drug delivery devices in several countries because they contain nicotine, and their advertising has been restricted until safety and efficacy clinical trials are conclusive. Since they do not contain tobacco, television advertising in the US is not restricted. Some countries have regulated e-cigarettes as a medical product even though they have not approved them as a smoking cessation aid. A 2014 review stated the emerging phenomenon of e-cigarettes has raised concerns in the health community, governments, and the general public and recommended that e-cigarettes should be regulated to protect consumers. It added, \"heavy regulation by restricting access to e-cigarettes would just encourage continuing use of much unhealthier tobacco smoking.\" A 2014 review said these products should be considered for regulation in view of the \"reported adverse health effects\".\n\nOn 19 December 2012 the European Commission adopted its proposal to revise the European Union Tobacco Products Directive 2001/37/EC which included proposals to introduce restrictions on the use and sales of e-cigarettes.\nOn 8 October 2013 the European Parliament in Strasbourg voted down the Commission's proposal to introduce medical regulation for e-cigarettes, but proposed that cross-border marketing of e-cigarettes be regulated similarly to tobacco products, meaning that sales of e-cigarettes to under-18s would be prohibited in the European Union, along with most cross-border advertising. Warning labels also would be required. The Parliament and Member States are involved in trilogue discussions to reach a common conclusion. In February 2014, the European Parliament approved new regulations for tobacco products, including e-cigarettes. The new regulations forbid advertising of e-cigarettes, set limits on maximum concentrations of nicotine in liquids, limit maximum volumes of liquid that can be sold, require child-proof and tamper-proof packaging of liquid, set requirements on purity of ingredients, require that the devices deliver consistent doses of vapor, require disclosure of ingredients and nicotine content, and empower regulators to act if the regulations are violated. In October 2014 e-cigarette manufacturer Totally Wicked won the right to challenge the directive at the Court of Justice of the EU. The hearing took place on 1 October 2015 and the results will not be announced until early 2016.\n\nIn autumn 2013, the e-cigarette industry ran \"a determined lobbying campaign\" to defeat proposed European legislation to regulate e-cigarettes like medical devices. Pharmaceutical manufacturers GlaxoSmithKline and Johnson & Johnson have lobbied the US government, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the EU parliament for stricter regulation of e-cigarettes which compete with their products Nicorette gum and nicotine patches.\n\nPrior to 8 August 2016, regulations concerning the use of e-cigarettes varied considerably across the United States, although there is more variation regarding laws limiting their use by youth than regarding multi-level regulations, such as banning their use in public places. The FDA classified e-cigarettes as drug delivery devices and subject to regulation under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) before importation and sale in the US. The classification was challenged in court, and overruled in January 2010 by Federal District Court Judge Richard J. Leon, explaining that \"the devices should be regulated as tobacco products rather than drug or medical products.\"\n\nIn March 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia stayed the injunction pending an appeal, during which the FDA argued the right to regulate e-cigarettes based on their previous ability to regulate nicotine replacement therapies such as nicotine gum or patches. Further, the agency argued that tobacco legislation enacted the previous year \"expressly excludes from the definition of 'tobacco product' any article that is a drug, device or combination product under the FDCA, and provides that such articles shall be subject to regulation under the pre-existing FDCA provisions.\" On 7 December 2010, the appeals court ruled against the FDA in a 3–0 unanimous decision, ruling the FDA can only regulate e-cigarettes as tobacco products, and thus cannot block their import. The judges ruled that such devices would only be subject to drug legislation if they are marketed for therapeutic use – E-cigarette manufacturers had successfully proven that their products were targeted at smokers and not at those seeking to quit. The District Columbia Circuit appeals court, on 24 January 2011, declined to review the decision \"en banc\", blocking the products from FDA regulation as medical devices.\n\nIn April 2014, the FDA proposed new regulations for tobacco products, including e-cigarettes. The regulations require disclosure of ingredients used in e-cigarette liquids, proof of safety of those ingredients, and regulation of the devices used to vaporize and deliver the liquid. The FDA proposed regulation would ban the sale of e-cigarettes with nicotine to any individual under 18 years of age. In August 2014, attorneys general from over two dozen states advised the FDA to enact restrictions on e-cigarettes, including banning flavors. On 10 May 2016, the FDA published their deeming regulations in the \"Federal Register\", which were to take effect on 8 August 2016. Vendors and companies had until two years afterward to prepare paperwork with the FDA to have their product remain on the market. Currently, there are lawsuits and amendments made in the works in Congress to change that provision. The lack of research on the risks and possible benefits has resulted in precautionary policymaking in the US \"which often lacks grounding in empirical evidence and results in spatially uneven diffusion of policy\". The time by which applications for regulated non-combustible tobacco product devices for review has been extended to August 8, 2022.\n\nAs of 8 August 2016, the FDA extended its regulatory power to include e-cigarettes. Under this ruling the FDA will evaluate certain issues, including ingredients, product features and health risks, as well their appeal to minors and non-users. The FDA rule also bans access to minors. A photo ID is required to buy e-cigarettes, and their sale in all-ages vending machines is not permitted. The FDA in September 2016 has sent warning letters for unlawful underage sales to online retailers and retailers of e-cigarettes. FDA regulations have also applied to the advertising of e-cigarettes since 2016. Per FDA regulations, e-cigarettes, e-liquid, and associated products cannot be advertised as safer than other tobacco products unless they have received modified risk tobacco product (MRTP) status. , this status has not been granted to any e-cigarette or e-liquid product. Though no companies have applied for an MRTP permit for their vaping products, similar heat-not-burn tobacco products have been denied MRTP status on the grounds that they are not safer than traditional cigarettes.\n\nOn December 5, 2016 HUD passed a rule banning the use of tobacco products in common areas and within each home unit. HUD did not include e-cigarettes in their list of prohibited tobacco products, and they will allow each public housing agency to make that decision. The ban includes cigarettes, cigars, pipes and waterpipes (hookahs). E-cigarettes were not included because they believe there would be no maintenance cost savings or a lowered risk of destructive fires. HUD commented that there is a lack of evidence that the vapor causes any damage to the units.\n\nBeginning in May 2018, the FDA began to crack down on e-liquid brands whose packaging resembles food or beverage products. FDA is particularly concerned about e-liquids whose packaging resembles that of candy, juice boxes, and other products intended to appeal to children, because of concern that children will mistakenly drink the e-liquid and die of nicotine poisoning. Nicotine is especially toxic to young children, and a 60 ml bottle of e-liquid with 11 mg/ml nicotine concentration, the average e-liquid bottle in the U.S., is likely to kill a child of age 4 or younger. As such, the FDA has charged e-liquid products with branding that resembles food, candy, or beverage items as being misbranded and using false advertising, which is illegal under the Tobacco Control Act of 2009 (specifically sections 903(a)(1) and 903(a)(7)(A) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, ).\n\nEffective 8 August 2016, all US states will follow the same, uniform federal guidelines. With an absence of federal regulations, many states and cities had adopted their own e-cigarette regulations, most commonly to prohibit sales to minors, including Maryland, Kentucky, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Tennessee, Utah, Wisconsin, and Colorado. Other states are considering similar legislation. Several US cities and states have enacted laws that increased the legal age to purchase e-cigarettes to age 21. , some states in the US permit e-cigarettes to be taxed as tobacco products, and some state and regional governments in the US had extended their indoor smoking bans to include e-cigarettes.\n\nGovernor Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed a bill that would regulate the sale of e-cigarettes within the state on grounds that \"if adults want to purchase and consume these products with an understanding of the associated health risks, they should be able to do so.\"\n\nA review of regulations in 40 U.S. states found that how a law defines e-cigarettes is critical, with some definitions allowing e-cigarettes to avoid smoke-free laws, taxation, and restrictions on sales and marketing. Less policies have been created to restrict vaping indoors than with cigarette smoking.\n\nMany local and state jurisdictions have recently begun enacting laws that prohibit e-cigarette usage everywhere that smoking is banned, although some state laws with comprehensive smoke-free laws will still allow for vaping to be permitted in bars and restaurants while prohibiting e-cigarettes in other indoor places. As of August 2016, the United States Navy is considering banning e-cigarettes. A 2017 report stated \"As of 2 October 2015, five US states and over 400 counties have implemented some form of restriction of ECIG use indoors. International policies are more varied with certain restrictions for ECIG use in UK airports and trains and reports of complete ECIG bans in indoor public places for Malta, Belgium and Spain\". San Francisco banned the sale of flavored e-liquids in 2018. They are the first city in the US to enact such a ban.\n\n (see also Electronic cigarettes in Australia): The Federal Department of Health and Ageing classifies every form of nicotine, except for replacement therapies and cigarettes, as a form of poison. In Australia, there are no laws pertaining to the regulation of e-cigarettes. Although there are a number of laws that are relevant to the regulation of poisons, therapeutic goods, and tobacco control which are applicable to e-cigarettes in certain cases. Australia is developing regulations on e-cigarettes. The sale of e-cigarettes must be registered with the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) before being sold. Importation of e-cigarettes and their related products, if they claim to help people quit smoking, is illegal unless approved by the TGA. The TPA has said that there were no laws preventing the importation of e-cigarettes bought over the internet for personal use, unless prohibited by state and territory legislation. State laws in Australia's various states are a little bit conflicting. According to the Poisons Standard of 2010, inhaled nicotine is Pharmacy Only, or a Schedule 2 medication when used to help quit smoking. In April 2014 a court decision made it illegal to sell or supply e-cigarettes regardless of their appearance or nicotine content (even if zero) in Western Australia. Previously they were banned if they looked like cigarettes. The court ruled that the action they provided in and of itself looks like cigarettes. Precise rules in the other states vary.\n\nThe states of Karnataka, Kerala, Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir, Mizoram and Maharashtra have banned e-cigarettes under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, and Food Safety & Standards (Prohibition and Restriction on Sales) Regulation, 2011. In August 2018, the Central Government had asked the states to ban all types of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems.\n\n"}

The film also co-stars Cynthia Rothrock, Melvin Wong, Wu Ma, Roy Chiao and director Yuen himself. \"Righting Wrongs\" is the one of Yuen Biao's better known films that he made without film industry compatriots Sammo Hung and Jackie Chan.\n\nThe film's Hong Kong English language title is \"Righting Wrongs\". The international version (dubbed in English) is titled \"Above the Law\", which was also the title adopted for The Weinstein Company's 2007 US DVD release on their Dragon Dynasty label.\n\nJason Ha Ling-ching (Yuen Biao) is a dedicated, by the books prosecutor who has tried to maintain patience and tolerance under the somewhat flimsy laws of the court. However, when his mentor is publicly gunned down in New Zealand and when the key witness of Ha's latest case and his entire family are wiped out over night, Ha can no longer go by the book.\n\nHa initial plan is to take the law into his own hands and kill the two men he believes called for his witness' murder. He is successful in killing the first, which causes the Hong Kong police department to wake up and take action to regain order. Enter Senior Inspector Cindy Si (Cynthia Rothrock), who is put on the case to find the killer under her superior, Superintendent Wong Ching-wai (Melvin Wong). However, when Ha goes to kill the second defendant, Chow Ting-kwong (James Tien), he is already dead. Unbeknownst to them, both of the defendants were working under an even higher power, known only as \"Crown\". However, it is soon discovered that \"Crown\" is none other than Superintendent Wong, who was also Chow's killer.\n\nOnce Si realizes that Wong is the true mastermind behind all of the recent murders taking place, she and Ha finally work together to bring him in to prove he is not \"above the law\". However, depending on the version of the story told, both Si and Ha fall victim to their ambition, with Si killed with a large screw through the neck by Wong and Ha falling to his demise after killing Wong in an out of control airplane. However, in another version of the story, Si survives her attack from Wong, and while Ha still kills Wong, he falls victim to a different, and rather ironic, fate: Ha is given an eight-year sentence in prison under the charge of manslaughter (English dub), or a life sentence in prison under the charge of First Degree Murder (Mandarin dub).\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Leading legal, land, and other experts work as volunteers to the Foundation and its committees.\n\nThrough educational programs, the Foundation brings together lawyers, landmen, managers, government personnel, law faculty, students, and others involved in mineral, oil & gas, water, and other resources.\n\nThe Foundation was organized in 1955 to provide broad educational coverage over a wide geographic area\nto many practitioners and mineral company personnel who were interested in a field of law in which only a few\nwere expert, and to avoid duplication of effort among the law schools and industry organizations\ninterested in the problems of the rapidly developing mineral industry, particularly the oil and gas industry\nin the Rocky Mountain area. The first institute brought mineral resources lawyers together to hear experts\ntalk on significant and timely subjects. The papers from the conference provided permanent reference material, which\nwas made available by publication of the Proceedings of the First Annual Institute. The Foundation has\ncontinued to be a meeting place and focal point for lawyers and others\nwhose work brings them into contact with the legal aspects mining, oil and gas, energy, water, public lands, and related areas.\n\nWhen the decline of the oil and gas industry occurred in the Rocky Mountain area in the early 1960s,\nit was accompanied by increased activity in \"hard rock\" minerals. Commencing around 1965, the\nFoundation gave increasing attention to mining law and to expansion into water law, as well as expanding\ngeographically into new areas of the west. This policy was put into effect in 1967 by adding to the Annual\nInstitutes a section for water lawyers, an innovation that has continued to the present time. The geographic expansion\nmight be considered as beginning with the 14th Annual Institute at Flagstaff, Arizona in 1968,\nwhich also inaugurated a Landman's Section that has since been a regular feature of the Annual Institute.\n\nThe Foundation began a new era with the appointment of David P. Phillips as Executive Director in December 1970. The regions served have gradually expanded past the Rocky Mountains under the direction of Mr. Phillips, first to Canada and Mexico and then later to South America. The Foundation today is a tribute to the foresight of its founders, who created a structure with a balance that has accommodated diverse opinions.\n\nIn fulfilling its goals, the Foundation carries out varied programs of interest to attorneys, landmen, management, government personnel, law faculty, students, and others involved in mining, oil and gas, energy, water, public lands, and related areas of natural resources law. These programs include annual and special institutes and short courses in various locations around the world.\n\nThe Foundation is probably best known for the Annual Institutes and the published \"Proceedings\"\ncontaining the scholarly papers presented at each of the Institutes. Annual Institutes were originally held on the campuses of member law schools such as the \nUniversity of Montana at Missoula, the University of Utah at Salt Lake City, the University of New Mexico at\nAlbuquerque, and the University of Denver.\n\nInstitutes today are no longer held on-campus, with the most recent sites including Vancouver, Snowmass, San Francisco, Banff, Santa Fe, and Newport Beach.\n\nThe Special Institutes are intended to examine specific topics in depth. Some of the repeating core topics include Mining Agreements, Oil and Gas Agreements, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and Federal and Indian Oil and Gas Royalty Valuation and Management.\n\nUnder the format of a Short Course, an entire field of law is reviewed. Topics have included Mineral Title Examination and Oil and Gas Law. Short Courses on international law are routinely held both in the United States and countries around the world.\n\nIn addition to institutes and courses, the Foundation publishes a variety of educational materials:\n\n\nThe Grants Program was established by the Foundation in 1976 to promote scholarship, research, writing, teaching, and the study of mineral resources law and related fields at law schools around the country. Grants awards typically range from $2000 to $5000. Applications are evaluated by the RMMLF Grants Committee, with preference given to the Foundation's Constituent Law Schools and to projects having results of widespread utility and value such as the preparation of teaching materials, publications, and visiting lectureships on mining law, oil and gas law, energy law, water law, public land law and related areas.\n\nThe Scholarships Program consists of the Joe Rudd Scholarships, established in 1980 in honor of a prominent natural resources attorney in Alaska, and the RMMLF Scholarships, established in 1993.\nLaw students enrolled full-time at one of the Foundation's Constituent Law Schools who demonstrate a commitment to the study of natural resources law are eligible to apply for tuition scholarships. Academic and leadership ability as well as financial need are evaluated by the Foundation's Scholarships Committee consisting of volunteer attorneys.

He cited the websites \"The Real Singapore\" which published an article claiming that a commotion between Thaipusam participants and the police was sparked by complaints from a Filipino family, the \"States Times Review\" which mocked former President S. R. Nathan with an article claiming near-zero turnout for his funeral, and \"All Singapore Stuff\" which reported eye-witness account of a collapsed HDB roof at Punggol Waterway Terraces which fooled the police and civil defence to investigate.\n\nThe Minister claimed that fake news, when not debunked, can quickly cause harm to Singaporeans, panic to public, waste emergency resources, and damage reputations of businesses and people. He also claimed that nasty people seek to profit from fake news and that foreign agencies and foreign governments seek to destabilise the government through fake news.\n\nDuring his keynote speech at \"Keep It Real: Truth And Trust In The Media\" conference on 19 June 2017, Shanmugam said the government has to maintain a strong climate of trust, and be able to counter misinformation spread online. He cited a recent government survey that supported his notion for stronger laws to combat fake news.\n\nShanmugam claimed that Singapore has been \"particularly vulnerable\" to foreign influences via fake news. \"If the distrust becomes deep-rooted, people will have serious doubts about the institutions, about leadership, about governance,\" he said.\n\nOn 5 January 2018, the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) and Ministry of Law (MinLaw) published a Green Paper titled \"Deliberate Online Falsehoods\" detailing the need to establish a Select Committee to examine fake news threat in Singapore. On 10 January 2018, 80 MPs present voted unanimously in Parliament to appoint a Select Committee of eight PAP MPs, one opposition MP and one NMP to study and report on the problem of deliberate online falsehoods and recommend strategies to deal with them.\n\nThe Select Committee convened public hearings from 14 March to 29 March 2018, lasting eight days in total, where 79 individuals and organisations were invited to testify.\n\nSingaporean historian Thum Ping Tjin submitted a paper arguing that any legislation by the Singapore Parliament against online falsehood must also apply to the Singapore government. He argued that government's use of detention without trial between 1963 and 1988 during Operation Coldstore and Operation Spectrum. While the government has stated that the detainees were part of a communist plot or Marxist conspiracy to subvert the state, Thum claimed that the government has never produced any evidence to substantiate its claims nor have any detainees been brought to trial on the charges they were detained under. Thum argued that these justifications were false claims made by politicians of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) for the purpose of political gain.\n\nOn 29 March, the last day of the sitting of the Select Committee, Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam questioned Thum about a paper he published in 2013 regarding Operation Coldstore and the formation of Malaysia\".\" He said Thum fell short of the standards of an objective historian, saying that he \"ignores evidence which you don't like, you ignore and suppress what is inconvenient and in your writings you present quite an untrue picture\". Thum countered that his paper had been peer-reviewed and that no historian had stepped forward to contradict the central thrust of his work.\n\n\"Channel NewsAsia\" and \"The Straits Times\" reported that Thum admitted that there were parts of the paper which he could have worded better, that some of his statements were misleading, and that he had not read nor bother to quote many of the accounts of some communist leaders as he felt that those accounts were unreliable. These included the first-hand accounts of Chin Peng, the leader of the Malayan Communist Party. However, in a subsequent follow-up submission to the Select Committee, Thum claimed that the reports took his words out of context, arguing that \"the crux of my original submission was not addressed in the discussion\", \"the fundamental arguments... were not raised nor challenged\", and \"at no point did I accept that any part of my article was inaccurate or misleading\". He insisted that \"my overall point in my article that Operation Coldstore was fundamentally motivated by political, not security, reasons, stands\".\n\nCivil activists groups Community Action Network, Function 8, and \"Maruah\", as well as activists Kirsten Han, Terry Xu, and Thum himself, criticised the open hearings, accusing the Select Committee of failing to adhere to its own terms of reference, and claiming the hearings had not been conducted in an open or consultative manner.\n\nA letter signed by 170 academics was submitted to Chong, criticising the hearing as an attempt to attack and destroy Thum's credibility and discredit his research, with the effect of stifling the freedom of expression and academic freedom in Singapore. A letter from six of Thum's colleagues at the University of Oxford's Project Southeast Asia also expressed concerns about how Thum was treated at the hearing, saying that Thum's research, which Shanmugam had criticised, had \"already met the rigorous standards of examination at Oxford and peer review by fellow historical experts on the region\". The letter also expressed concerns about the \"implications for academic freedom, and for freedom of expression in Singapore\", saying that the hearing \"appears designed to intimidate those who seek to publish the truth\".\n\nIn response, Chong argued that it was Thum who had chosen to make a political point in his written submission to the Select Committee, and that while Thum was entitled to his views, he must expect to be questioned about his claims. He also characterised Thum's submission as a \"political piece\" rather than an \"academic dissertation\".\n\nChong also released a report based upon attached emails between two trustees of Project Southeast Asia that were inadvertently copied to the Select Committee, showing email discussions between Thum and Philip Kreager from the University of Oxford's Project Southeast Asia regarding the drafting and sharing of a letter in support of Thum. Chong accused Thum of having \"engineered\" the open letter in support of himself, as well as getting Kraeger to canvass for support on his behalf. Chong alleged \"a coordinated attempt, with foreign actors involved, to try to influence and subvert our parliamentary processes\". Kreager called Chong's statement \"clearly preposterous\", insisting that the emails were merely to \"exchange views\", and accusing Chong of imagining a \"conspiracy\".\n\nOn 13 April, the Parliament Secretariat wrote to Thum to clarify his academic credentials following his claims to be a \"research fellow in history\" in his submission and holding \"a visiting professorship in anthropology at Oxford University\" during his oral testimony. Following media enquiries, the University of Oxford replied that Thum was a research associate at the School of Anthropology and Museum Ethnography.\n\n"}
{"id": "25874017", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25874017", "title": "Sexual orientation in the United States military", "text": "Sexual orientation in the United States military\n\nThe United States military formerly excluded gay men, bisexuals, and lesbians from service. In 1993, the United States Congress passed and President Bill Clinton signed a law instituting the policy commonly referred to as \"Don't ask, don't tell\" (DADT) which allowed gay, lesbian, and bisexual people to serve as long as they did not reveal their sexual orientation. Although there were isolated instances in which service personnel met with limited success through lawsuits, efforts to end the ban on openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual people serving either legislatively or through the courts initially proved unsuccessful.\n\nIn 2010, two federal courts ruled the ban on openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual service personnel unconstitutional, and on July 6, 2011, a federal appeals court suspended the DADT policy. In December 2010, the House and Senate passed and President Barack Obama signed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010, and under its provisions, restrictions on service by gay, lesbian, and bisexual personnel ended as of September 20, 2011.\n\nTo train the new American Army in the latest military drills and tactics, General George Washington brought in Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben (1730–94), who had been an officer on the German General staff. Von Steuben escaped Germany where he was threatened with prosecution for homosexuality. He joined Washington's army at Valley Forge in February 1778 accompanied by two young aides. Steuben became an American general, and a senior advisor to Washington. Despite rumors about his parties, there never was an investigation of Steuben and he received a Congressional pension after the war.\n\nThe first evidence of antipathy to homosexuals serving in the United States military dates from March 11, 1778, when Lieutenant Frederick Gotthold Enslin was drummed out of the Continental Army following his conviction at court-martial on charges of sodomy and perjury.\n\nThe U.S. military discharged soldiers for homosexual acts throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth century even in the absence of any explicit prohibition of sodomy. The Articles of War of the United States of 1916, implemented on March 1, 1917, included Article 93 stating that any person subject to military law who committed \"assault with intent to commit sodomy\" shall be punished as a court-martial may direct. That was modified on June 4, 1920, to make the act of sodomy itself a crime. The change went into effect on February 4, 1921. It was the first express prohibition of homosexuality or homosexual conduct in the armed forces of the United States.\n\nThe several branches of the U.S. lacked a unified policy on service by homosexuals for most of their history. Before 1949, each tended to charge personnel caught engaging in homosexual conduct with sodomy, court-martial them, and issue them a dishonorable discharge. In 1940, psychiatrists Harry Stack Sullivan and Winfred Overholser formulated guidelines for psychiatric screening for military inductees. Both believed homosexuals should not be inducted, and neither proposed excluding all homosexuals from military service. Despite their recommendations, other psychiatrists and military officials made homosexuality a key component of the screening apparatus they recommended. The United States Army Surgeon General's office issued a circular in 1941 that for the first time classified \"homosexual proclivities\" as disqualifying inductees from military service. The United States Navy and the Selective Service adopted similar exclusionary policies. The Women's Army Corps adopted a similar policy in 1944. The Women's Army Corps instituted harsh screening policies for recruits, often based on physical appearance and gender conformity, in order to exclude lesbians from service. WAC policies also condoned heterosexual relationships with servicemen in order to discourage homosexual conduct.\n\nWith the mass mobilization and deployment of troops for operations in World War II, it became impractical to convene court-martial boards for homosexual conduct offenses. Commanders instead issued blue discharges – a form of administrative military discharge – to homosexual personnel. The blue discharge, which was also issued disproportionately to African Americans, was neither honorable nor dishonorable. However, blue discharge holders faced difficulties in civilian life because the blue discharge carried with it a negative association. The Veterans Administration denied blue-discharge veterans the benefits of the G.I. Bill as a general policy. In 1944, a policy directive ordered that homosexuals were to be committed to military hospitals, examined by psychiatrists and discharged under Regulation 615-360, section 8.\n\nFor example, staff sergeant Allen Irvin Bernstein, who was arrested in January 1944 by military police after a failed pickup attempt with another soldier, was confined in a psychiatric ward at Camp Lee, Virginia, and discharged within a month. He subsequently appealed the discharge decision, attaching a copy of his 140-page defense of homosexuality, \"Millions of Queers (Our Homo America)\", which, however, was ignored and remained forgotten and unpublished until rediscovered in 2010 by a researcher in the National Library of Medicine. Denied all veterans benefits, Bernstein continued to refile appeals with the Army until, 37 years later, the Army accepted his appeal and retroactively converted his blue discharge to an honorable discharge in 1981.\n\nBlue discharges were discontinued in May 1947 and replaced with two new headings, \"general\" and \"undesirable\". A general discharge was considered to be under honorable conditions though distinct from an \"honorable discharge.\" An undesirable discharge was under conditions other than honorable, yet distinct from a \"dishonorable discharge\". The Army also changed its regulations to ensure that homosexuals would not qualify for general discharges. Under this system, a servicemember found to be homosexual but who had not committed any homosexual acts while in service received an undesirable discharge. Those found guilty of engaging in homosexual conduct were dishonorably discharged.\n\nIn 1945, four honorably discharged gay veterans formed the Veterans Benevolent Association, the first such organization. It was primarily social in nature and its membership peaked at 100. The group disbanded in 1954, and several of its members later formed the New York chapter of homophile advocacy group One, Inc.\n\nIn October 1949, the newly consolidated Department of Defense standardized anti-homosexual regulations across all branches of the military: \"Homosexual personnel, irrespective of sex, should not be permitted to serve in any branch of the Armed Forces in any capacity, and prompt separation of known homosexuals from the Armed Forces is mandatory.\"\n\nPresident Harry S. Truman signed legislation on May 6, 1950, creating the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which became effective on May 31, 1951. It established a single justice system for the armed forces. Its Article 125 forbids sodomy among all military personnel, defining an offender as \"any person subject to this chapter who engages in unnatural carnal copulation with another person of the same or opposite sex or with an animal is guilty of sodomy. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete the offence.\"\n\nThe success of the armed forces in pre-screening self-identified gay and bisexual people from the 1940s through 1981 remains in dispute; during the Vietnam War, some men pretended to be gay in order to avoid the draft. However, a significant number of gay and bisexual men and women did manage to pass through the screening process and serve in the military, some with special distinction.\n\nFor example, in the 1950s, the Navy medical doctor Tom Dooley received national fame for his anti-Communist and humanitarian efforts in Vietnam. He was forced to resign in March 1956 when found to have participated in homosexual activities. The Navy conducted the first official study on sexual orientation and the Navy regulations and rules. In 1957, the Crittenden Report found that gay-identified people were no more likely to be a security risk than heterosexual-identified people, but nevertheless recommended that homosexuals be excluded from service because \"Homosexuality is wrong, it is evil, and it is to be branded as such.\"\n\nSan Francisco politician and gay rights campaigner Harvey Milk served in the United States Navy during the Korean War. He served aboard the submarine rescue ship USS Kittiwake (ASR-13) as a diving officer, later transferring to Naval Station, San Diego to serve as a diving instructor. In 1955, he was discharged from the Navy at the rank of lieutenant, junior grade, though whether his homosexuality was an issue in his discharge is doubted by researchers.\n\nBy the 1970s, a gay servicemember who had not committed any homosexual acts while in service generally received a general discharge, while those found to have engaged in homosexual conduct more often received undesirable discharges. Gay servicemembers received a disproportionate percentage of undesirable discharges issued.\n\nDuring the 1970s, beginning with Leonard Matlovich, who was featured on the cover of \"Time\" magazine, several high-profile court challenges to the military's regulations on homosexuality occurred, with little success, and when such successes did occur it was when the plaintiff had been open about his homosexuality from the beginning or due to the existence of the \"queen for a day\" rule, which stated that if a service-member was caught having sex with a person of the same gender they could avoid being discharged if the \"member did not have a propensity of intent to engage in homosexual acts.\"\n\nIn 1981, the Department of Defense issued a new regulation on homosexuality that was designed to ensure withstanding a court challenge by developing uniform and clearly defined regulations and justifications that made homosexual status, whether self-applied or by the military, and conduct grounds for discharge (DOD Directive 1332.14 (Enlisted Administrative Separations), January 1981):\n\nThe directive justified the policy and removed the \"queen for a day\" rule that had prompted some courts to rule against the armed forces. However, the intent of the policy had also been to treat homosexuality as being akin to a disability discharge and thus ensure that anyone found engaging in homosexual activity and/or identifying as gay, would be separated with an honorable discharge. The DOD policy has since withstood most court challenges, although the United States Supreme Court has refused to weigh in on the constitutionality of the policy, preferring to allow lower courts and the United States Congress to settle the matter.\n\nIn the 1980s, many of the Democratic Party presidential candidates expressed an interest in changing the regulations concerning homosexuality in the armed forces, and, as American social mores changed, public opinion began to express more sympathy with gay people in armed forces, at least to the extent that investigations into a serviceman or -woman's sexual behaviour and/or orientation were seen as a witch-hunt. \"Gays in the military\" became a political issue during the 1992 Presidential campaign, when Clinton, the Democratic candidate, promised to lift the military's ban on homosexual and bisexual people.\n\nIn 1992, the United States General Accounting Office published a report entitled \"Defense Force Management: DOD's Policy on Homosexuality\", that outlined the DOD policy on homosexuality and the reasons for it. The report also included excerpts from a previously unpublished 1988 Defense Personnel Security Research and Education Center study on homosexuality that made similar conclusions as the 1957 Crittenden Report.\n\nSome LGBT military personnel sought to overturn the military's ban on service by homosexuals. Among the earliest were Leonard Matlovich, who fought to remain in the Air Force after coming out in 1975, and Perry Watkins, who was drafted in 1967 despite disclosing his homosexuality on his induction papers. District Court judge Gerhard Gesell ordered Matlovich's reinstatement in 1980. Rather than return Matlovich to duty, the Air Force offered him a cash settlement of $160,000, which Matlovich accepted. The Army tried to discharge Watkins several times, until the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ordered his reinstatement in 1989 and the United States Supreme Court refused to hear the case. The appellate court, however, did not rule the military policy unconstitutional in Watkins's case. Rather, it decided that simple equity mandated that the Army could not discharge Watkins for homosexuality when it knew of his sexual orientation all along. Other high-profile discharges included those of Vernon Berg, III, Keith Meinhold, and Tracy Thorne from the Navy; Joseph Steffan from the Naval Academy; Margarethe Cammermeyer from the Washington National Guard; and Miriam Ben-Shalom from the Army Reserve.\n\nAt the height of the push to rescind the ban before DADT, Miriam Ben-Shalom joined with other discharged personnel to form the Gay, Lesbian & Bisexual Veterans of America.\n\nDon't ask, don't tell (DADT) is the common term for the policy restricting the United States military from efforts to discover or reveal closeted gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members or applicants, while barring those that are openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual from military service.\n\nFollowing the implementation of DADT, the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network was formed to protect the rights of active duty personnel. Other organizations include Servicemembers United which formed in 2005 by veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and groups associated with West Point (Knights Out) and the Naval Academy (USNA Out).\n\nService members discharged under DADT continued to seek redress through the courts without success. Courts often cited the Supreme Court's 1986 decision in \"Bowers v. Hardwick\", which upheld the constitutionality of state sodomy laws. After the Supreme Court reversed \"Bowers\" in \"Lawrence v. Texas\" (2003), the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces ruled that the \"Lawrence v. Texas\" decision applies to Article 125 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which banned all acts of sodomy. In both \"United States v. Stirewalt\" and \"United States v. Marcum\", the court found Article 125 constitutional, but ruled that the \"conduct falls within the liberty interest identified by the Supreme Court,\" but also said that despite the application of \"Lawrence\" to the military, Article 125 could still be upheld in cases where there are \"factors unique to the military environment\" that would place the conduct \"outside any protected liberty interest recognized in \"Lawrence\"\", such as fraternization, public sexual behavior, or anything that would adversely affect good order and discipline. Convictions for consensual sodomy have been overturned in military courts under the \"Lawrence\" in \"United States v. Meno\" and \"United States v. Bullock\". In the course of reviewing the end of DADT, the Department of Defense's Comprehensive Review Working Group recommended repealing or amending Article 125 to eliminate any ban on consensual sodomy between adults.\n\nMajor legal challenges to the DADT policy include \"Witt v. Department of the Air Force\" and \"Log Cabin Republicans v. United States\". The first ended in a negotiated settlement, but only after the lesbian plaintiff whom the Air Force tried to discharge won retirement with full benefits in 2011 as DADT neared its end. In the second, Federal Judge Virginia A. Phillips ordered the military on October 12, 2010, to suspend and discontinue any investigation or discharge, separation, or other proceeding that began under DADT. A series of appeals and stays of her ordered followed in the fall of 2010 just as Congressional attempts to repeal DADT took shape.\n\nAn attempt to repeal DADT began in May 2010 when the House approved an amendment to the 2011 National Defense Authorization Act. It failed in September, when Sen. John McCain led a successful filibuster against it. In December 2010, after a second Senate filibuster, Senators Joe Lieberman and Susan Collins introduced the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010. It passed the House of Representatives on December 15. and the Senate on December 18 by a vote of 65-31. President Barack Obama signed the bill on December 22.\n\nOn December 29, 2010, the Department of Justice asked the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to suspend proceedings in the \"Log Cabin\" case. Instead, on July 6, 2011, that court, citing progress made by military officials in preparing for an end to DADT, ordered the government to cease enforcement of DADT while dismantling the policy.\n\nRepeal was not immediate. The Department of Defense first reviewed its policies and guidelines and drafted implementation regulations. Then the President, the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff certified that new regulations had been drafted and that the new regulations would not damage military cohesion and readiness. That certification triggered a 60-day waiting period at the end of which, on September 20, 2011, DADT expired.\n\nA research report that appeared in the journal \"Armed Forces & Society\" at the end of 2011 said that military academy cadets opposed allowing homosexuals to serve openly in greater percentages than participants in ROTC did, and that both groups opposed such service to a greater degree than their civilian counterparts. Some news outlets viewed this as a negative reaction to the repeal of DADT earlier in the year, but the authors of the study said it drew on survey data collected between 2002 and 2007 and believed their research provided no information about opinions following the end of DADT. They wrote that the strong degree of anti-gay sentiment found among entering cadets declined somewhat during their time at the service academies: \"Surprisingly, military culture appears to have made cadets more tolerant of gays and lesbians, not less.\"\n\nDespite the end of DADT on September 20, 2011, the same-sex spouses of gay and lesbian service members were not treated on a par with the different-sex spouses of military service members because of restrictions imposed by Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and certain federal statutes that contain definitions of marriage that exclude same-sex couples. Same-sex spouses are denied death benefits, identification cards, base access, access to repatriation ceremonies, and other entitlements.\n\nIn December 2012, the Association of Bragg Officers Spouses (ABOS) denied membership to Ashley Broadway, the female spouse of a female Army officer. During the weeks of press coverage that ensued, Fort Bragg's commander said he lacked authority over the private organization while the U.S. Marines announced that clubs conducting business on base must admit same-sex spouses. ABOS offered Broadway a \"special guest membership\", which she declined. On January 26, \"Military Spouse\" magazine named Broadway Fort Bragg's 2013 \"Military Spouse of the Year\". That same day, ABOS invited Broadway to join and announced that its membership was open to \"any Spouse of an active duty commissioned or warrant Officer with a valid marriage certificate from any state or district in the United States\".\n\nOn February 11, 2013, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta announced the Department's extension of certain military \"additional benefits\" to same-sex spouses which are not explicitly prohibited under the Defense of Marriage Act, in addition to \"member-designated benefits\" which were already available to same-sex spouses. In June 2013, the Pentagon announced plans to begin issuing identification cards to the same-sex partners of servicemembers, which will allow them to access education, survivor, commissary, travel, counseling and transportation benefits, but not health care and housing allowances.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) brought suit in 2010 on behalf of servicemembers discharged for homosexuality who received only half the standard separation pay upon discharge. All were discharged under the DADT policy, but the ACLU said that the practice ante-dated the adoption of DADT. On January 7, 2013, the ACLU reached a settlement with the federal government in \"Collins v. United States\" that provided for the payment of full separation pay to servicemembers discharged under \"Don't ask, don't tell\" since November 10, 2004. Some 181 were expected to receive about $13,000 each.\n\nThe American Military Partner Association (AMPA) was formed in 2009 to enable the LGBT partners of servicemembers and veterans to provide support in areas where the military fails to and to advocate on behalf of equal treatment of those in same-sex relationships.\n\nFollowing the end of DADT, approximately 114,000 servicemembers who had been separated from military service since WW II under the categories \"other than honorable discharge\", \"general discharge\", or \"dishonorable discharge\" became eligible to have their discharges amended. Those without an honorable discharge are often excluded from veterans benefits like health care and tuition assistance, and the lack of an honorable discharge can create a hurdle to employment in the civilian sector as well. The Armed Forces established procedures for processing such requests through the Military Department Board for Correction of Military/Naval Records or the Military Department's Discharge Review Board. In June 2013, after advocates for gay and lesbian veterans complained about the process, Representatives Mark Pocan (D-Wisconsin) and Charles Rangel (D-New York) introduced the Restore Honor to Service Members Act in the House of Representatives to codify the process and reduce inconsistencies. Pocan said the legislation represented the same policies as those currently in place, but was needed because \"without having it in law, it could change at some date in the future with a different administration.\" The American Bar Association endorsed the legislation on November 21, 2013. On January 30, 2014, Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) introduced the same legislation in the Senate.\n\nOn June 26, 2013, the Supreme Court held in \"United States v. Windsor\" that the statute under which the U.S. military was withholding benefits from servicemembers in same-sex marriages, Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act, was unconstitutional. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel stated: \"The Department of Defense welcomes the Supreme Court's decision [and] will immediately begin the process of implementing the Supreme Court's decision in consultation with the Department of Justice and other executive branch agencies. The Department of Defense intends to make the same benefits available to all military spouses—regardless of sexual orientation—as soon as possible.\"\n\nOn August 14, 2013, the Department of Defense (DoD) announced that it would provide spousal and family benefits to servicemembers in same-sex marriages on the same terms as it does to those in different-sex marriages. The benefits, which include health care coverage, housing allowances, military ID cards, and survivor benefits, can be claimed retroactive to June 26, the day of the \"Windsor\" decision. A same-sex marriage must be documented by a marriage certificate that establishes that the marriage was valid where it was celebrated. The DoD also announced that servicemembers who need to travel to a jurisdiction that allows them to marry will be afforded up to 7 days leave to do so, up to 10 days if they are stationed outside the U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said: \"This will provide accelerated access to the full range of benefits offered to married military couples throughout the department, and help level the playing field between opposite-sex and same-sex couples seeking to be married\". The DoD set September 3 as its target date for implementation. the servicemember's commander determines the amount of leave to be granted based on the servicemember's unit responsibilities and specific situation. Peter Sprigg of the Family Research Council, a longtime opponent of the end of \"don't ask, don't tell\", wrote that \"It could well be argued that the new policy actively discriminates against opposite-sex couples, who receive no special leave for their weddings\". DoD officials said the leave was for travel and cited Texas or South Korea as locations that pose problems for same-sex couples seeking to marry. The policy does not apply to those in same-sex legal relationships other than marriage, such as civil unions and domestic partnerships.\n\nThe Veterans Administration has cited other federal statutes that define \"spouse\" and 'surviving spouse' The status of benefits for veterans in same-sex relationships was the subject of ongoing lawsuits.\n\nIn 2015, Defense Secretary Ash Carter added sexual orientation to the list of nondiscrimination protections under the military's equal opportunity program. However, LGBT service members and veterans continue to face discrimination in the Veterans Health Administration. Often healthcare systems deny them adequate services and visitation rights to same-sex couples. HIV-positive service members overseas frequently had their possessions thrown overboard when their fellow comrades found out they tested positive.\n\nSeveral lawsuits on behalf of same-sex military spouses had challenged the constitutionality of DOMA and statutes that define \"spouse\" and \"surviving spouse\" as \"a person of the opposite sex\" when determining eligibility for veterans benefits.\n\nOn October 27, 2011, the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network (SLDN) had brought suit in federal court in Massachusetts on behalf of several military servicemembers and veterans in same-sex marriages. The benefits at issue in that case, \"McLaughlin v. Panetta\", included medical and dental benefits, basic housing and transportation allowances, family separation benefits, visitation rights in military hospitals, and survivor benefit plans. On June 27, the federal judge hearing the case asked the parties to explain by July 18 why the logic that found \"Windsor\" unconstitutional did not apply to that definition as well. On July 18, the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group BLAG, which had defended DOMA and the restrictive definitions of marriage acknowledged that \"[t]he Supreme Court recently resolved the issue of DOMA Section 3's constitutionality\" but took no position on the other statutes except to say that the constitutionality of those definitions \"remains open\". The Department of Justice told the court that it would not defend those statutes. BLAG asked to withdraw from a similar lawsuit in federal court in California, \"Cooper-Harris v. United States\", on July 22. On August 29, Judge Consuelo Marshall ruled that the provisions of Title 38 of the U.S. Code that define \"spouse\" so as to exclude those in same-sex marriages are unconstitutional.\n\nA similar case involving only veterans benefits, \"Cardona v. Shinseki\", is awaiting resolution in the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, after being suspended while awaiting the resolution of \"Windsor\". On July 19, 2013, Veterans Administration (VA) Secretary Eric Shinseki noted in a letter about the case that the statutory definitions of \"spouse\" and \"surviving spouse\" had yet to be invalidated by a court. The VA is waiting for guidance from the Justice Department on how \"Windsor\" applies to those statutes. Even if that statutory limitation is invalidated, the VA's rules for establishing the validity of a marriage may restrict benefits to same-sex married couples residing in a jurisdiction that recognizes their marriage or who resided in the jurisdiction where they married. The Respect for Marriage Act sponsored by Senator Dianne Feinstein and Representative Jerrold Nadler eliminates the question of residence by establishing a rule for federal purposes that a marriage is valid if it was valid where celebrated. They reintroduced the legislation the day \"Windsor\" was decided.\n\nOn September 4, Attorney General Eric Holder, as required by law, notified Speaker of the House John Boehner that the Obama administration had determined that it should not enforce the federal statutes that define \"spouse\" in a way that excludes same-sex spouses. He cited \"Windsor\" and the decision in \"Cooper-Harris\" the previous week as well as BLAG's withdrawal from litigation challenging the statutes in question. Advocates for same-sex spouses of veterans welcomed the announcement, but noted that the question of the rights of such spouses remained uncertain if they live in states that do not recognize their marriage.\n\nOn September 13, 2013, VA home loan benefits were extended to include service members in same-sex marriages.\n\nIn June 2014, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) announced that it would only provide benefits to the same-sex spouses of veterans who either (1) married in the state in which they resided or (2) live in a state that recognizes their marriage when they apply for benefits. On August 18, the American Military Partner Association filed an appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit challenging the VA's interpretation of federal law. Their brief cited \"Windsor\" and many federal court decisions since \"Windsor\" that have held denial of marriage rights to same-sex couples unconstitutional. It said the VA's policy ruling \"imports into federal law unconstitutional state definitions of marital status.\"\n\nIn several states that do not recognize same-sex marriages–notably Oklahoma, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas–National Guard officials initially refused to comply with Department of Defense directives to allow the same-sex spouses National Guard members in their states to enroll in federal benefit programs, instead requiring such members to travel to federal facilities to do so. Guard officials in Oklahoma enrolled some same-sex couples until September 5, 2013, when Governor Mary Fallin ordered an end to the practice. Defense Secretary Hagel on October 31 said he would insist on compliance.\n\nOn November 6, Fallin announced that Oklahoma guard members could have benefits requests for same-sex spouses processed at federal facilities. On November 20, after DoD officials objected to that plan, Fallin ordered that all married couples would be required to have benefits requests processed at those facilities. On November 26, Texas agreed to conform with DoD policy stating that state workers would be considered federal workers while enrolling same-sex couples for benefits. Louisiana adopted a policy like that of Texas on December 3, as did Georgia. and Mississippi the same week. On December 12, Secretary of Defense Hagel announced that all state national guard units were in compliance, though three of them–Oklahoma, Florida and South Carolina–allowed all guard members to apply for ID cards and benefits only at federal facilities. Some other states chose to place their state employees on federal status for the sake of processing such applications.\n\nThe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 enacted in December 2013 repealed the ban on consensual sodomy found in Article 125 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\n\nIn 2014, the U.S. Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is providing healthcare services for approximately one million gay and lesbian veterans. With the repeal of the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy, more gay and lesbian veterans will be seeking medical care. However, as noted by Sherman and her coauthors, there are many concerns regarding the healthcare needs of the gay and lesbian veterans, and many veterans do not feel that they have adequate and equitable healthcare services from the VHA. The researchers assert that veterans who are missing quality healthcare are less likely to maintain good health and positive well-being.\n\nIn their article, Sherman and her coauthors explain that in the past, most of the gay and lesbian veterans were uncomfortable in disclosing their sexual orientations or identities because they were afraid that this information could lead to their discharge from the military. With the repeal of the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy, gays and lesbians are assured that their sexual orientations will not be used against them. Nonetheless, because of their previous experiences in the military, many gay and lesbian veterans are still worried that this information may jeopardize their future careers and prospects. Because of societal stereotypes and stigmas, they are also worried that they may be denied medical service, lose their benefits, or receive inferior services.\n\nSherman and her coauthors conducted a study on the communications between the gay and lesbian veterans with their VHA providers and the experiences regarding their healthcare services. Most of them report dissatisfaction with their medical treatment. Many veterans state that they do not receive the necessary support from VHA medical providers. Moreover, they claim that their healthcare providers are not receptive to their medical needs, and they have never been asked about their sexual orientation. Most of the veterans report that they do not feel at ease with their healthcare providers. The results of the study also show that some gay and lesbian veterans are disinclined to seek medical treatment from the VHA, and some of them are having trouble in finding equitable healthcare services. Based on the study, there are some inherent problems in the healthcare provisions for the gay and lesbian veterans.\n\nSimilarly, another 2011 report states that lesbians often decline routine medical tests. Gay men are not as likely to seek medical treatment when compared with heterosexual men. Hence, some medical conditions and disorders may not be treated in a timely manner.\n\nHowever, Sherman and her co-authors point out that the missing patient-centered communication can affect the quality of medical treatment. Sexual orientation and identity can have implications for the physical and mental health of the patient.\n\nAccording to the authors, since sexual identity and orientation is a contentious issue, many healthcare workers are not comfortable in approaching this topic. But if the physicians initiate the conversation, it is more likely that the veterans will provide this information. Based on their data, if the gay and lesbian veterans can divulge information about their personal medical history, values, and preferences, they may experience higher levels of patient satisfaction. It is also more likely for them to receive appropriate preventive care and diagnostic screenings for their unique health risks, such as sexually transmitted diseases. Moreover, comprehensive medical records can provide a multitude of information useful not only for medical treatments but also for evaluations, such as the fitness of the veterans for duty.\n\nTo alleviate the concerns from the gay and lesbian veterans about discrimination and to address healthcare disparities, in 2013, the VHA has introduced some policy changes. For instance, the VHA has established the Office of Health Equity to oversee the gay and lesbian healthcare needs and to reduce the inequities in their healthcare provisions.\n\nThese new developments mark a milestone in expanding the role of the government in improving healthcare provisions for the gay and lesbian veterans. The VHA is instituting policies that focus on individualized care. They require healthcare providers to care for gay and lesbian patients in the same respectful and sensitive manner as other patients. Another policy is to redefine the meaning of \"family\" and allow the gay and lesbian veterans to decide who is regarded as part of their family. As of 2014, there are many discrepancies regarding this information. The information found on medical records is often inaccurate and may not clearly indicate the choice of the veterans. The VHA has also launched educational and training programs so that healthcare providers will have a better understanding of the psychological and social distresses of the gay and lesbian veterans.\n\nSince the gay and lesbian veterans are not asked to disclose information about their sexual orientation on medical forms, the healthcare providers are often unaware of this information when they consider medical treatment options. In response to these concerns, the Institute of Medicine suggested that patients disclose such information on medical records. The information will be confidential and only used to assess health. The VHA is striving to prevent this information from being shared with other organizations. Sharpe and Uchendu suggest the option of incorporating open-ended questions to encourage the veterans to supply additional written information.\n\nHealthcare services for gay and lesbian veterans are not adequate. The main purpose of the first steps of the VHA is to create a cordial culture and a welcoming environment for the gay and lesbian veterans. Fostering a better relationship among the healthcare providers and the patients and encouraging the patients to provide more personal information can improve healthcare outcomes for the gay and lesbian veterans.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8884393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8884393", "title": "Tacking (law)", "text": "Tacking (law)\n\nTacking is a legal concept arising under the common law relating to competing priorities between two or more security interests arising over the same asset. The concept is best illustrated by way of example.\nBank A will always have a first priority claim against the property for the full amount of its first advance. But it will be able to claim against the property in priority to Bank B with respect to its second advance only if it is permitted to \"tack\" the second advance to the mortgage that was taken at the time the first advance was made. If Bank A is not permitted to tack the second advance, then Bank B's claim in respect of the sums that it lent will have priority over Bank A's claims with respect to the second advance.\n\nIn American jurisprudence, \"Black's Law Dictionary\" defines tacking in slightly narrower terms:\n\nSeparately, in the definition of \"tabula in naufragio\", \"Black's\" comments:\n\nThe first case which approached the position in relation to competing mortgagees was \"Gordon v Graham\". During the nineteenth century, its authority came to be doubted. It was questioned whether it had been correctly reported and, even if correctly reported, whether it correctly stated the law.\n\nThe matter subsequently came before the House of Lords in \"Hopkinson v Rolt\". In the case, the borrower entered into a mortgage over his land which was expressed to \"secure the sums due and which shall from time to time become due\" to the bank. Later, the borrower granted a second mortgage in favour of another creditor. Notice of the second mortgage was given to the bank. The borrower was later declared bankrupt, and a dispute arose as to the priority of the bank with respect to advances which were made under the first mortgage after it had received notice of the second mortgage.\n\nThe three law lords who heard the case were divided, with a majority favouring priority for the second mortgagee. Lord Campbell, the Lord Chancellor (with whom Lord Chelmsford agreed), opined:\n\nThe dissenting judge, Lord Cranworth, was in favour of upholding the rule in \"Gordon v Graham\" as it was reported. He expressed his view in a dissenting opinion:\n\nAlthough for years it had been supposed that it was sufficient for the first mortgagee to have either actual or constructive notice of the second mortgage, in \"Westpac Banking Corporation v Adelaide Bank Limited\" it was held that constructive notice was not sufficient, and that a first mortgagee could tack future advances unless it had \"actual notice\" of the second ranking security.\n\nWhere a subordination agreement places a later mortgage in higher priority than one previously granted, the validity of releases granted by the previous mortgagors will have a significant impact on the priority assigned to each of the secured debts in question. In 2014, the Court of Appeal of Newfoundland and Labrador held in \"Medoc Properties Limited v. Standard Trust Company\" that the failure by an assignee to release one of two assigned mortgages with respect to such an agreement resulted in differing priorities given to them.\n\nThe common law rules relating to tacking have caused difficulty in relation to overdrafts and revolving loan facilities because of the rule in \"Clayton's Case\", which provided that in relation to any account, payments into the account are presumed to discharge the earliest debts first. This has been held to have several effects:\n\nThe rule is only a presumption of convenience, but in practice it is difficult to displace, and can have a devastating effect on the security rights of first mortgagees. For example, suppose a customer secures an overdraft with a mortgage against their house. Then at a time when the overdraft stands at £100,000, the customer grants a second mortgage over their house as security for a term loan to another bank. If over the following nine months, the customer was to pay £90,000 into the account and draw a further £70,000 out of the account, the amount owed to the first bank would be reduced to only £80,000, but they would only have first ranking security for a mere £10,000.

In the book, Unger identifies problems with contemporary leftism and proposes a way to achieve the goals that he believes should be central to the progressive cause: inclusive economic growth through the heating up of politics and democratizing the market economy, a relentless process of institutional innovation that depends less upon crisis for change, and depends more on shortening the distance between context-preserving and context-transforming moves. \"The Left Alternative\" was first published in 2006 as \"What Should the Left Propose?\"\n\nIn \"The Left Alternative\", Unger describes the situation of the world today as a \"dictatorship of no alternatives\": a condition in which in the world seems to offer few alternatives for lifting the majority of people out of lives of poverty, drudgery, and belittlement. Progressives content themselves with \"humanizing the inevitable,\" merely softening the effects of existing institutions. Unger contends that there are fragments of alternatives being developed across the world, but these do not appeal to the West and often amount to \"local heresies\" that would not survive a sustained challenge. What Unger proposes is a \"universalizing heresy\"—a set of ideas that are rooted in an attempt to achieve economic growth with social inclusion, and comprehensive and general enough to apply across the world. Such an alternative, envisioned by this universalizing heresy, would describe a narrow gateway through which all societies must pass on the way to creating actual difference.\n\nUnger contends that the contemporary left is disoriented, bereft of any plausible or compelling alternatives to the neoliberal consensus that has gained in authority and influence in the rich western countries, and missing as well the ideas to support such an alternative, agents to advance the alternative, or a crisis that would be an impetus for adopting the alternative. But there is an alternative, Unger argues, one that would show how to combine both social inclusion and individual empowerment in political, economic and social institutions. This alternative would reshape production and politics, would refuse to see familiar forms of market economy, representative democracy and free civil society as necessary or canonical, would reject the contrast between market-oriented and command-economy solutions as a focus of ideological contests, would focus more on equality and inclusion within a setting of economic growth and technological innovation, than on increasing equality by redistribution through tax-and-transfer. The solution would democratize and radicalize the market economy by innovating in its arrangements and rethinking its logic. The overall aim of social policy would be to enhance individual capabilities through education and social inheritance, advance democratization of the market economy, and establish institutions of high-energy politics. The guiding philosophy of Unger's proposal, he explains, is \"not the humanization of society; it is the divinization of humanity.\" Unger sees this alternative as applicable across a broad range of richer and poorer societies, thus making possible a \"universalizing heresy\" that can oppose the universalizing orthodoxy promulgated by the rich Western countries on a take-it-or-leave-it basis.\n\nThe agents of this program, Unger explains, are workers who want to be petty bourgeois, and nations that want to be different. The practice that has the most potential to spread the program throughout the world is \"innovation-friendly cooperation,\" a set of practices currently concentrated in the best firms and schools, that have been highly successful in spreading technological innovations across the globe. But rather than leaving the practice of innovation-friendly cooperation within the confines of a global network of elite firms and schools, Unger proposes that these practices be nurtured and extended with the assistance of government, extending the benefits of innovation-friendly cooperation to classes and communities that have traditionally been excluded from these benefits.\n\nUnger sees this \"left alternative\" offering great potential for developing countries, in helping them achieve both national difference and prosperity for their citizens, while rejecting the neoliberal agenda that threatens to stifle real national difference as the price of entry into global markets. The left alternative offers a chance for European countries to reinvent and reinvigorate social democracy, which has gradually been stripped of programs that represented democracy's most ambitious hopes of fostering individual freedom, prosperity, and dignity. And Unger's proposal offers the United States a chance to enact a fitting sequel to the New Deal, the promise of which was betrayed by decades of misguided progressive policies that alienated a great many of leftism's natural constituency and undermining the attempt to form a trans-racial progressive majority.\n\nAccording to Unger, an insidious tendency in world politics has been the manner in which globalization, as it is currently practiced and proselytized, has become a \"generic alibi for surrender\" to the status quo, and a mechanism for suppression of promising political, economic, and social alternatives. Unger argues that the question should not be \"how much globalization?\" but rather \"what manner of globalization?\" The objective of Unger's progressive alternative is a \"qualified pluralism: a world of democracies.\" \n\nUnger concludes by describing two competing conceptions of the left. The first conception, the one that is preeminent today, is what Unger calls a \"fake egalitarianism\": an institutionally conservative leftism that is committed to greater equality of life chances, sought principally through redistributive tax-and-transfer. The second conception, the one for which Unger argues, is one that has the goal of making us bigger, both collectively and individually, and seeks equality only to the extent that inequality diminishes us and threatens us with indignity and privation. This second conception, rather than being institutionally conservative, would support a practice of institutional experimentation with the goal of democratizing the market, deepening democracy, and empowering individuals.\n\nReviewing \"The Left Alternative\" in the \"London Review of Books\", Tom Nairn summarized Unger's ideas as follows:\n\nUnger sets out the following key idea: ‘The larger goal is a fuller mobilisation of national resources: a war economy without a war’, fostering ‘the institutions of a highenergy democracy’. Small nations can mean big, even universal lives and ideas; but they will go on requiring ‘a shield over national heresy’, a fostering of it, a mobilisation of resources ‘that allows petitioners to become rebels’... His arguments are overwhelmingly prescriptive lists of institutional changes that few will find undesirable and fewer still could imagine being implemented in, say, Wales, Finland, Kurdistan, Taiwan or Basra.\n\nWhile Nairn acknowledged the appeal of Unger's ideas, he concluded that the book was disappointingly general in its application: \"Thinktank manifestos normally address a specific population in a specific tongue, before being translated (with appropriate changes) for others. But Unger’s are written in a synthetic fusion of legal American and Brazilian that seems to belong everywhere and nowhere... Unger dwells on [a] weirdly anational plane.\"\n\nMichael B. Mathias reviewed \"The Left Alternative\" in \"Marx and Philosophy\". He wrote that \"The Left Alternative\" is \"a concise introduction to [Unger's] recent thought, which has shifted towards a more pragmatic and centrist position. Unger’s basic aimhere is to emancipate the world from‘the dictatorship of no alternatives’ by offering a constructive Leftist program.\" Mathias was critical of the book's ambitions: \"Unger certainly captures the dismay that many of us feel in the face of an implacable neoliberal orthodoxy and the constriction of human possibilities that it entails. And he offers a welldeserved rebuke to those on the Left who have become institutionally conservative in attitude and abandoned any transformative ambition. Nonetheless, what Unger characterizes as the ‘first steps’ in a new direction seemmore like giant leaps given the political realities that presently constrain opportunities for change.\"\n\n\"Publishers Weekly\" called \"The Left Alternative\" a \"stimulating visionary manifesto.\" The review went on to offer a mixed assessment of the book:\n\nSome readers will no doubt find his sweeping indictment of social democracy unfair, his co-optation of avant-garde management theory naive, and his celebration of change and upheaval utopian. Many of his proposals, like privatizating social services or making everyone hold a second job in the \"caring economy\" tending to the old, the young, the sick, the poor or the desperate (no, family members don't count), are ill thought-out. Still, he offers an incisive critique of social and economic discontents, one that turns traditional Marxist formulations on their heads (\"we... are, in large numbers, petty-bourgeois now.\") The result is a provocative challenge to left orthodoxies that should spur plenty of controversy and fresh thinking.\n\n\"\" reviewed the book as follows: \"\"The Left Alternative\"—previously named \"What Should the Left Propose?\" (2005)—presents itself as a proposal for the Left to change the world and offers many crucial ‘directions’ to the Left in order to achieve genuine democracy.\" The review concludes that \"this book provides some interesting proposals to change the world. However, the author does not entirely deny the existing economic and political systems but attempts to reform, reshape and improve them. This book should be recommended to anyone who questions the legitimacy of the capitalist world and to those who have faith in the idea that ‘another world is possible’.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5529868", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5529868", "title": "Tracing (law)", "text": "Tracing (law)\n\nTracing is a legal process, not a remedy, by which a claimant demonstrates what has happened to his/her property, identifies its proceeds and those persons who have handled or received them, and asks the court to award a proprietary remedy in respect of the property, or an asset substituted for the original property or its proceeds. Tracing allows transmission of legal claims from the original assets to either the proceeds of sale of the assets or new substituted assets.\n\nTracing ordinarily facilitates an equitable remedy, and is subject to the usual limitations and bars on equitable remedies in common law countries. In many common law countries, there are two concurrent processes, tracing at common law and tracing in equity. However, because the right to trace at common law is so circumscribed, the equitable process is almost universally relied upon, as equitable tracing can be performed into a mixed fund.\n\n\"Tracing is thus neither a claim nor a remedy. It is merely a process by which a claimant demonstrates what has happened to his property, identifies its proceeds and the persons who have handled or received them, and justifies his claim that the proceeds can properly be regarded as representing his property.\" - \"Foskett v. McKeown\"\n\nFor example, if A has money in a solicitor’s account and the solicitor takes that money to buy a painting, then A may be able to make a claim against the painting. This claim will take priority even if the solicitor is bankrupt and has other unsecured claims against him.\n\nJudicially, probably the most famous example of a tracing claim is \"Attorney‐General for Hong Kong v Reid\" [1994] 1 AC 324, [1994] 1 NZLR 1 (PC), where Mr Reid, then a crown prosecutor for Hong Kong, received bribes for passing information to organised crime in Hong Kong. Under Hong Kong law, the proceeds of those bribes were held on constructive trusts for the government of Hong Kong. Mr Reid then invested the proceeds of the bribes in land in New Zealand, and the land increased substantially in value. When he was caught, Mr Reid admitted that the money was subject to a constructive trust, but argued that he should only be liable to repay the amount of the bribes, and then any profit attributable to the increase in value of the land in New Zealand was not connected with his wrongdoing. However, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council held that the government of Hong Kong's claim to the money could be traced into the land, and thus the claimant was entitled to the full value of the land, as without his wrong, Mr Reid would never have made those profits and it would be grossly inequitable for him to keep them.\n\nTracing claims have two key advantages to claimants.\n\nThe law of tracing is enormously complex, even to practitioners. Characteristically, tracing claims tend to involve fraud, and as a result most claims (and case law) are against the background of a complex factual matrix. However, the law itself is also complex, and a number of key aspects of the law remain ambiguous in many countries.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, there are several reasonably well establishing defences to tracing claims, although the case law is not entirely consistent. The common defences to an equitable tracing claim are:\n\nImportantly, in each case it is only the \"remedy\" of tracing that is lost. The claimant may well still enjoy a \"personal\" claim against the wrongdoer, even though they may have lost their proprietary right to trace into substituted assets.\n\nIn common law countries there are a variety of remedies that can be imposed when the court is satisfied that an equitable tracing claim has been made. The principal remedies are:\n\nIf an asset appreciates in value, the claimant may be well advised to claim proprietary right in the asset (no.1 and 4). If an asset depreciates in value, the claimant would be better off if he acquires a charge or lien over the asset (no. 2 and 3) as he can still enforce the whole amount of the charge against the asset and recover the balance via a personal action.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "51022732", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51022732", "title": "Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons", "text": "Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons\n\nThe Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), or the Nuclear Weapon Ban Treaty, is the first legally binding international agreement to comprehensively prohibit nuclear weapons, with the goal of leading towards their total elimination. It was passed on 7 July 2017. In order to come into effect, signature and ratification by at least 50 countries is required. For those nations that are party to it, the treaty prohibits the development, testing, production, stockpiling, stationing, transfer, use and threat of use of nuclear weapons, as well as assistance and encouragement to the prohibited activities. For nuclear armed states joining the treaty, it provides for a time-bound framework for negotiations leading to the verified and irreversible elimination of its nuclear weapons programme.\n\nAccording to a mandate adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in December 2016, negotiations on the treaty began in the United Nations in March 2017 and continued from 15 June to 7 July 2017. In the vote on the treaty text, 122 were in favour, 1 voted against (Netherlands), and 1 abstained (Singapore). 69 nations did not vote, among them all of the nuclear weapon states and all NATO members except the Netherlands.\n\nThe nuclear-weapon-ban treaty, according to its proponents, will constitute an \"unambiguous political commitment\" to achieve and maintain a nuclear-weapon-free world. However, unlike a comprehensive nuclear weapons convention, it was not intended to contain all of the legal and technical measures required to reach the point of elimination. Such provisions will instead be the subject of subsequent negotiations, allowing the initial agreement to be concluded relatively quickly and, if necessary, without the involvement of nuclear-armed nations. \n\nProponents of the ban treaty believe that it will help \"stigmatize\" nuclear weapons, and serve as a \"catalyst\" for elimination. Around two-thirds of the world's nations have pledged to work together \"to fill the legal gap\" in the existing international regime governing nuclear weapons, and view a nuclear-weapon-ban treaty as one option for achieving this objective.\n\nNuclear weapons – unlike chemical weapons, biological weapons, anti-personnel landmines and cluster munitions – are not prohibited in a comprehensive and universal manner. The Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1968 contains only partial prohibitions, and nuclear-weapon-free zone treaties prohibit nuclear weapons only within certain geographical regions.\n\nThe \"preamble\" of the treaty explains the motivation by the \"catastrophic consequences\" of a use of nuclear weapons, by the risk of their sheer existence, by the suffering of the \"hibakusha\" (the surviving victims of the 1945 atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki) and the victims of nuclear tests, by \"the slow pace of nuclear disarmament\" and by \"the continued reliance on nuclear weapons in military and security concepts\" like deterrence. It recognizes \"the disproportionate impact of nuclear-weapon activities on indigenous peoples\". It expresses compliance with existing law: the UN charter, international humanitarian law, international human rights law, the very first UN resolution adopted on 24 January 1946, the NPT, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and its verification regime, as well as nuclear-weapon-free zones. Furthermore, the \"inalienable right\" of a peaceful use of nuclear energy is emphasized. Finally, social factors for peace and disarmament are recognized: participation of both women and men, education, public conscience, \"international and regional organizations, non-governmental organizations, religious leaders, parliamentarians, academics and the \"hibakusha\"\".\n\n\"Article 1\" contains prohibitions against the development, testing, production, stockpiling, stationing, transfer, use and threat of use of nuclear weapons, as well as against assistance and encouragement to the prohibited activities. Finally, any direct or indirect \"control over nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices\" is forbidden.\n\n\"Article 2\" requires each party to declare whether it had nuclear weapons of their own or deployed on its territory, including the elimination or conversion of related facilities.\n\n\"Article 3\" requires parties that do not possess nuclear weapons to maintain their existing IAEA safeguards and, if they have not already done so, to accept safeguards based on the model for non-nuclear-weapon states under the NPT.\n\n\"Article 4\" sets out general procedures for negotiations with an individual nuclear armed state becoming party to the treaty, including time limits and responsibilities. If that state has eliminated its nuclear weapons before becoming a party to the treaty, an unspecified \"competent international authority\" will verify that elimination, and the state must also conclude a safeguards agreement with the IAEA to provide credible assurance that it has not diverted nuclear material and has no undeclared nuclear material or activities. If that state has not yet destroyed its arsenal, it must negotiate with that \"competent international authority\" a time-bound plan for the verified and irreversible elimination of its nuclear weapons programme, which will submit it to the next meeting of signing states or to the next review conference, whichever comes first.\n\n\"Article 5\" is about national implementation. \"Article 6\" obliges to environmental remediation and to assistance for the victims of the use and testing of nuclear weapons. According to \"Article 7\", states should assist each other to these purposes, with special responsibility of the nuclear powers. More generally, all state parties shall cooperate to facilitate the implementation of the treaty. \"Article 8\" fixes meetings of states parties, the costs of which are shared by the states according to the UN scale of assessment (\"Article 9\"). \"Articles 10–12\" are about the possibility of amendments, the settlement of disputes and the \"goal of universal adherence of all States to the Treaty\".\n\nAccording to \"Articles 13–15\", the treaty was open for signature from 20 September 2017 at the UN headquarters in New York. The \"Treaty shall enter into force 90 days after the fiftieth instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession\".\n\nProposals for a nuclear-weapon-ban treaty first emerged following a review conference of the NPT in 2010, at which the five officially recognized nuclear-armed state parties – the United States, Russia, Britain, France and China – rejected calls for the start of negotiations on a comprehensive Nuclear weapons convention. Disarmament advocates first considered starting this process without the opposed states as a \"path forward\". Subsequently, a less technical treaty concentrated on the ban of nuclear weapons appeared to be a more realistic goal.\n\nThree major intergovernmental conferences in 2013 and 2014 on the \"humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons\", in Norway, Mexico and Austria, strengthened the international resolve to outlaw nuclear weapons. The second such conference, in Mexico in February 2014, concluded that the prohibition of a certain type of weapon typically precedes, and stimulates, its elimination.\n\nIn 2014, a group of non-nuclear-armed nations known as the New Agenda Coalition (NAC) presented the idea of a nuclear-weapon-ban treaty to NPT states parties as a possible \"effective measure\" to implement Article VI of the NPT, which requires all states parties to pursue negotiations in good faith for nuclear disarmament. The NAC argued that a ban treaty would operate \"alongside\" and \"in support of\" the NPT.\n\nIn 2015, the UN General Assembly established a working group with a mandate to address \"concrete effective legal measures, legal provisions and norms\" for attaining and maintaining a nuclear-weapon-free world. In August 2016, it adopted a report recommending negotiations in 2017 on a \"legally binding instrument to prohibit nuclear weapons, leading towards their total elimination\".\n\nIn October 2016, the First Committee of the UN General Assembly acted upon this recommendation by adopting a resolution that establishes a mandate for nuclear-weapon-ban treaty negotiations in 2017 (with 123 states voting in favour and 38 against, and 16 abstaining). North Korea was the only country possessing nuclear weapons that voted for this resolution, though it did not take part in negotiations.\n\nA second, confirmatory vote then took place in a plenary session of the General Assembly in December 2016.\n\nFrom 27 to 31 March 2017, convened as the United Nations Conference to Negotiate a Legally Binding Instrument to Prohibit Nuclear Weapons, Leading Towards their Total Elimination, a first round of negotiations was held at UN headquarters in New York, with the participation of 132 nations. At the end, the president of the negotiating conference, Elayne Whyte Gómez, permanent representative of Costa Rica to the UN in Geneva, called the adoption of a treaty by 7 July \"an achievable goal\". Representatives from governments, international organizations and civil society, such as the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, noted the positive atmosphere and strong convergence of ideas among negotiating participants. They agreed that the week’s debates had set the stage well for the negotiations in June and July.\n\nSummarizing the discussions, a first ban treaty draft was presented on 22 May by Elayne Whyte Gómez. The German section of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) highlighted Article 1, 2a prohibiting any stationing of nuclear weapons on their own territory. Hence, several NATO states – Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy and Turkey – would have to end contracts on nuclear sharing with the USA before they possibly could sign the negotiated ban treaty. Already in 2010, the German Bundestag had decided with large majority to withdraw nuclear bombs from Germany, but it was never realized. By contrast, in June 2017 foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel confirmed again nuclear stationing in Germany as well as the principle of equilibrium nuclear deterrence against Russia. He stated that consequently Germany could not support the ban process.\nThe only NATO member participating in the treaty negotiations was the Netherlands. \n\nArticle 1, 1c (in extension of Article 1, 2a) prohibits direct or indirect control of nuclear weapons. Accepting this provision would preclude a common European nuclear force or German financing of and limited decision on the French force de frappe; both options are sometimes discussed.\n\nA second conference started at 15 June and was scheduled to conclude on 7 July 2017. 121 out of 193 UN members participated in the negotiations.\n\nDuring the discussions about Article 1, several states pleaded for an explicit prohibition of nuclear military planning, others of financial assistance to development and production of nuclear weapons. Finally, these additions were rejected, but remained implicitly included in Article 1 (d) - (e).\n\nOn 27 June, a second draft was published. It now offered a precise \"join and destroy\" option for nuclear armed states: States joining the treaty \"shall submit, no later than sixty days after the submission of its declaration, a time-bound plan for the verified and irreversible destruction of its nuclear weapons programme to be negotiated with the States Parties\" (Article 4, 1). A second \"destroy and join\" option (Article 4, 5) only provides cooperation with the IAEA in order to verify the correctness and completeness of the inventory of nuclear material, no verification of the elimination. This has been changed in the final text. A further discussed topic was the explicit acceptance of the \"use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination\". The respective affirmation remained part of the final preamble.\n\nA third draft was presented on 3 July 2017. A last obstacle for agreement was the condition of the withdrawal clause, meaning that a state party \"in exercising its national sovereignty, [...] decides that extraordinary events related to the subject matter of the Treaty have jeopardized the supreme interests of its country\". The majority perspective was that this condition is subjective, and no security interests can justify genocide, nor can mass destruction contribute to security. However, as also a neutral withdrawal clause not giving reasons was not accepted by the minority, the respective Article 17 was accepted as a compromise. Safeguards against arbitrary use are the withdrawal period of twelve months and the prohibition of withdrawal during an armed conflict.\n\nThe vote on the final draft took place on 7 July 2017, with 122 countries in favour, 1 opposed (Netherlands), and 1 abstention (Singapore).\n\nAmong the countries voting for the treaty's adoption were South Africa and Kazakhstan, both of which formerly possessed nuclear weapons and gave them up voluntarily. Iran and Saudi Arabia also voted in favour of the agreement. There are indications that Saudi Arabia has financially contributed to Pakistan's atomic bomb projects and in return has the option to buy a small nuclear arsenal, an option that would be realized in the event that Iran obtains nuclear warheads. \n\nAccording to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), a coalition of non-governmental organizations, leading proponents of a nuclear-weapon-ban treaty include Ireland, Austria, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa and Thailand. All 54 nations of Africa (all but one of which have either signed or ratified the 1996 Treaty of Pelindaba establishing a nuclear-weapon-free-zone in the continent) and all 33 nations of Latin America and the Caribbean (already in a nuclear-weapon-free-zone under the 1967 Treaty of Tlatelolco) had subscribed to common regional positions supporting a ban treaty. The 10 nations of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which concluded the Southeast Asian Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty, participated in the negotiations, but Singapore abstained from the vote. Many Pacific island nations are also supportive.\n\nNo nuclear-armed nation has expressed support for a ban treaty; indeed, a number of them, including the United States, and Russia, has expressed explicit opposition. North Korea was the only nuclear state to vote for initiating ban negotiations.\n\nMany of the non-nuclear-armed members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), along with Australia and Japan, are also resistant to a ban treaty, as they believe that US nuclear weapons enhance their security. A statement was put forward by several NATO members (not including France, the United States, nor the United Kingdom, the nuclear weapon states within NATO), claiming that the treaty will be 'ineffective in eliminating nuclear weapons' and instead calling for advanced implementation of Article VI of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n\nFollowing the treaty's adoption, the permanent missions of the United States, the United Kingdom and France issued a joint statement indicating that they did not intend \"to sign, ratify or ever become party to it\". After stating that the instrument clearly disregarded the realities of the international security environment, they said accession to it was \"incompatible with the policy of nuclear deterrence, which has been essential to keeping the peace in Europe and North Asia for over 70 years\".\n\nContrary to government position in a number of nations, several recent opinion polls – including Australia, and Norway – have shown strong public support for negotiating an international ban on nuclear weapons. The Netherlands voted against adoption of the treaty, while Germany did not participate, despite opinion polls against presence of nuclear weapons in both countries. An example of consensus between government and majority opinion is Sweden.\n\nThe ICAN has been the main civil society actor working alongside governments to achieve a strong and effective ban treaty. The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement has also championed an agreement to prohibit and eliminate nuclear weapons, describing the UN working group recommendation to negotiate a ban in 2017 as \"potentially historic\". Thousands of scientists from around the world signed an open letter in support of the negotiations. \n\nIn a July 2017 public statement endorsed by over 40 Buddhist, Christian, Jewish and Muslim leaders and groups, \"Faith Communities Concerned about Nuclear Weapons\" called for universal adoption of the treaty. At a high-profile Vatican conference in November 2017, the first major international disarmament gathering following the treaty's adoption in July, Pope Francis took a stance further than his papal predecessors to condemn the possession of nuclear weapons and warn that nuclear deterrence policies offer a \"false sense of security.\"\n\nXanthe Hall (IPPNW and ICAN) said she regretted the boycott of the treaty by all nuclear powers and their allies, but hints at history: also the Mine Ban Treaty or the Convention on Cluster Munitions have been concluded against the states possessing such weapons, but finally were signed by most states. The request of a nuclear ban could only weaken the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), regarding that the nuclear forces were blocking multi-lateral disarmament negotiations since 1995, instead were planning modernization and rearmament. Therefore, they would abdicate from their responsibility of disarmament according to the NPT, Article VI. Then the danger would grow that in reaction other nations felt less stronger bound to non-proliferation. By contrast, the nuclear weapon ban treaty would aim at a new disarmament dynamics, hence would much more recover than weaken the NPT.\n\nIn \"NATO Review\", Rühle indicated that according to proponents, it was intended to strengthen Article VI of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which requires good faith efforts to negotiate effective measures on nuclear disarmament. Sceptics have argued that the Ban Treaty would harm the NPT.\n\nPolitical parties supporting the government in NATO member states often share the rejection of the nuclear ban negotiations and treaty by their governments. However, in May 2016 the Dutch parliament adopted a motion urging the government to work for \"an international ban on nuclear weapons\". Earlier in 2016, a majority of Norwegian parliamentarians signalled their support for a ban, while in Germany, the Bundestag opted in 2010 for nuclear disengagement by a large majority. Nevertheless, Norway and Germany did not participate in the negotiations, while the Netherlands voted against the treaty.\n\nIn response to an appeal made by ICAN, over eight hundred parliamentarians around the world pledged their support for a ban treaty, calling upon \"all national governments to negotiate a treaty banning nuclear weapons and leading to their complete eradication\" and describing it as \"necessary, feasible and increasingly urgent\". The countries they represent included members of both the world's existing nuclear-weapon-free zones as well as NATO states. Of the five nuclear-armed permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, the United Kingdom was the only one to have elected representatives lend their support to the initiative.\n\nAs of September 2018, 69 states have signed the Treaty and 19 have ratified it.\n\n\n"}

It has been formed to investigate the causes of the ethnic violence that gripped Solomon Islands between 1997 and 2003. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission is the first of its kind in the Pacific Islands region.\n\nThe purpose of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission is to \"address people's traumatic experiences during the five-year ethnic conflict on Guadalcanal (1999–2004)\". Its goal is to promote national unity and reconciliation. The members of the TRC will hear testimony from witnesses and victims of the violence, which killed over 100 people and displaced more than 20,000 internal refugees nationwide.\n\nIt is modelled after the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa, which was chaired by then Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Tutu, a Nobel Peace Prize recipient, has taken an active role in the establishment of the TRC in Solomon Islands.\n\nSolomon Islands descended into ethnic violence between 1997 and 2003. Much of the violence was committed by rival ethnic gangs from the islands of Guadalcanal and Malaita. The gangs took advantage of ethnic tensions between Malaitan settlers on Guadalcanal and the island's indigenous residents. The Isatabu Freedom Movement, which was made up by indigenous residents of the island of Guadalcanal, fought for several years with the Malaita Eagle Force, a militia group consisting mainly of residents and settlers from Malaita. The two groups fought for political power, jobs and land rights, especially on the island of Guadalcanal.\n\nThe violence was finally quelled by the Australian-led Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), which was invited into the country by the government of former Prime Minister Allan Kemakeza in 2003. RAMSI finalised operations in Solomon Islands as of 30 June 2017.\n\nIn late August 2008, Sam Iduri, Minister for Peace and Reconciliation, introduced a Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill to the National Parliament of Solomon Islands. In February 2009, it was reported that Archbishop Desmond Tutu, former chair of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa, would visit the Solomons in April to assist in setting up the Commission.\n\nAustralia has contributed approximately 500,000 towards the establishment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.\n\nThe Truth and Reconciliation Commission is composed of five members, three of which are citizens of the Solomon Islands, while two others were chosen from outside of the country. There are three men and two women.\n\nThe National Selection Committee was charged with choosing the five members of the TRC. The Chairman of the National Selection Committee, Chief Justice of the Solomon Islands Supreme Court Sir Albert Palmer, submitted the names of the proposed members to the Prime Minister of Solomon Islands on 22 April 2009, as required by the Truth and Reconciliation Act of 2008 (TRC Act, 2008).\n\nThe Prime Minister of Solomon Islands Derek Sikua announced the five members of the TRC on 27 April 2009, two days before the launch of the Commission. Sikua thanked the selection committee for working to choose the members of the commission. \"I also wish to thank our people for their participation and in thanking them, I wish to call on our people to help the Truth and Reconciliation Commission because without the Truth there can be no true reconciliation and thus no lasting national peace, unity and healing.\"\n\nBy law, the members of the TRC must begin their investigations within fourteen days of their appointment by Prime Minister Sikua.\n\nThe five members of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) are:\n\nThe Commission was officially launched on 29 April 2009, at the Lawson Tama Stadium in Honiara, the capital of Solomon Islands.\n\nThousands of Solomon Islanders attended the opening, which included a speech by Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Tutu spoke of the need for forgiveness in the country to achieve a long term, sustainable peace. Prime Minister Derek Sikua told the crowd that the TRC marked an important day in the history of Solomon Islands and the years of ethnic violence which engulfed the country, \"The launching of the Commission is a vital part of the efforts as Solomon Islands continue to work towards closure of a most challenging chapter in the history of the country, when disputes led to conflict and conflict erupted into violence between communities.\"\n\nTutu is also hosting a conference called the Winds of Change, which will bring together former combatants from Malaita and Guadalcanal for reconciliation talks.\n\nThe Commission's first public hearings were held in March 2010, with victims called upon to describe their sufferings during the violence. The Commission explained that the aim of the process was to provide victims with an opportunity to be heard, \"end th[e] silence and make the whole country to give recognition to their sufferings\" : \"Above all, it will help to restore the dignity of the victims, to retrieve the memory of those who were killed, and to hear the voice of those who were humiliated and abused in countless ways.\" Victims were permitted to name groups who had caused their suffering, but not individuals. The Commission would not pass judgement, but treat the hearings as \"moments to listen with respect and compassion\".\n\nThe opening of the hearings was attended by Governor-General Frank Kabui, Prime Minister Derek Sikua, Speaker of Parliament Sir Peter Kenilorea and the Chief Justice.\n\n"}

Most of that protection was however confined in one of two ways. An employer could not dismiss an employee for a prohibited reason, most typically membership of a union. An individual however could not challenge their own dismissal as being unfair and instead had to rely upon a union challenging the fairness of the dismissal. This remedy however was generally only available in the state tribunals. A similar definition existed at the Commonwealth level, however it was considerably limited by the requirement under the Constitution to establish an inter-state dispute. The ability for an individual to seek relief from unfair dismissal was first established in a statutory scheme in South Australia in 1972, followed thereafter by Western Australia, Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria in the early 1990s.\n\nProtection from unfair dismissal at the Commonwealth level was enhanced in 1984 by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission with its ruling in the \"Termination, Change and Redundancy Case\", that awards should contain a provision that dismissal \"shall not be harsh, unjust or unreasonable\" and subsequent awards following it were upheld by the High Court of Australia. The Parliament of Australia later extended the reach of protection from unfair dismissal with the passage of the \"Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993\", which was based on the external affairs power and the ILO \"Termination of Employment Convention, 1982\".\n\nIn current Australian law, unfair dismissal occurs where the Fair Work Commission, acting under section 385 of the \"Fair Work Act 2009\", determines that:\n\n\nIf the Fair Work Commission determines that a dismissal was unfair, the Commission must decide whether to order reinstatement or compensation. The Commission is required to first consider whether reinstatement is appropriate and can only order compensation (capped at 6 months pay) if it is satisfied that reinstatement is inappropriate.\n\nThe scope of coverage is quite broad. The Commonwealth has declared that all employers falling within its jurisdiction are subject to the scheme, including:\n\nIn addition, the States have delegated certain classes of employers by virtue of the Constitution's referral power:\n\nIn general, it covers those who have worked more than six months for an employer (or more than one year for a small business employer), for which one or more or the following conditions must apply:\n\n\nWhere the \"Fair Work Act\" does not apply, relief from unfair dismissal may arise under State laws. In Western Australia, recourse may be available from the Western Australian Industrial Relations Commission.\n\nLabour law in Canada falls within both federal and provincial jurisdiction, depending on the sector affected. Complaints relating to unjust dismissal () (where \"the employee has been dismissed and considers the dismissal to be unjust,\" which in certain cases also includes constructive dismissal) can be made under the \"Canada Labour Code\", as well as similar provisions in effect in Quebec and Nova Scotia, all of which were introduced in the late 1970s.\n\nUnder the federal Code, non-unionized employees with more than twelve months of continuous employment, other than managers, have the ability to file complaints for unjust dismissal within 90 days of being so dismissed. In making the complaint, the employee has the right to \"make a request in writing to the employer to provide a written statement giving the reasons for the dismissal,\" which must be supplied within 15 days of the request. Complaints are initially investigated by an inspector, who will then work towards a settlement within a reasonable time, failing which the Minister of Employment and Social Development may refer the matter to an adjudicator in cases other than where \"that person has been laid off because of lack of work or because of the discontinuance of a function\" or \"a procedure for redress has been provided elsewhere in or under this or any other Act of Parliament.\" Where the dismissal is determined to be unjust, the adjudicator has broad remedial authority, including ordering the payment of compensation and reinstatement to employment.\n\nWhile many employers have attempted to contract out of these provisions through the payment of a severance package together with a signed release from pursuing any claims under the Code, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in 2016 that the Code's provisions effectively ousted such common law remedies.\n\nUnfair dismissal became part of French labour law in 1973, but certain other protections had been previously instituted as far back as 1892.\n\nThe \"Labour Code\" () governs the procedure under which dismissal () may occur, as well as specifying the grounds under which it is valid or not. Dismissal may occur on grounds of personal performance () or economic reasons ().\n\nWhere the employer believes that there is a valid reason () for dismissal on personal grounds, it must give five working days' notice to the employee that a meeting with him must take place, and a decision to dismiss (exercised in writing, sent by registered mail) can only be made not less than two days afterwards.\n\nWhere dismissal occurs on economic grounds, the employee has the right to be notified of the employer's obligation during the following 12 months to inform him of any position that becomes available that calls for his qualifications. Failure to give prior notice, as well as failure to advise of any open position, will be causes for unfair dismissal.\n\nAn employee may challenge a dismissal by making a complaint to the Labour Court ().\n\nWhere an employee has at least two years' service, the employer faces several claims:\n\nWhere unfair dismissal occurs because of the failure to observe the notification obligations for recall rights, the court may award:\n\nWhere an employee has less than two years' service, or where the workforce has fewer than 11 employees, recall rights are not available, as well as the normal remedies for unfair dismissal. The remedy of one month's pay is still available in cases involving failure to follow procedural requirements, and an appropriate amount of compensation may still be ordered in cases where dismissal was improperly executed ().\n\nWhere an employee has had at least one year's service, the employer also faces a separate claim for severance pay (). The amount is equal to 20% of the base monthly pay times the number of years' service up to 10 years, plus 2/15 of base monthly pay times the number of years' service greater than 10 years.\n\nUnfair dismissal in Namibia is defined by the \"Labour Act, 2007\", under which the employer has the burden of the proof that a dismissal was fair. Explicitly listed as cases or unfair dismissal are those due to discrimination in terms of race, religion, political opinion, marital or socio-economic status, as well as dismissals that arise from trade union activities. Any termination of employment that does not give any valid and fair reason is automatically assumed unfair.\n\nAfter the release of the Donovan Report in 1968, the British Parliament passed the Industrial Relations Act 1971 which introduced the concept of unfair dismissal into UK law and its enforcement by the National Industrial Relations Court. The Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 abolished the court and replaced it with a network of industrial tribunals (later renamed employment tribunals). The scheme is currently governed by Part X of the Employment Rights Act 1996.\n\nEmployees have the right not to be unfairly dismissed (with the exception of a number of exclusions). Following discussions with an employer, an employee can agree not to pursue a claim for unfair dismissal if they reach a settlement agreement (historically a compromise agreement). For a settlement agreement to be binding the employee must have taken advice as to the effect of the agreement from a relevant independent adviser, that is a qualified lawyer; a Trade Union certified and authorised officer, official, employee or member; or a certified advice centre worker.\n\nIn 2011, Aikens LJ summarized the jurisprudence on what constitutes an unfair dismissal:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "840644", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=840644", "title": "United States tort law", "text": "United States tort law\n\nThis article addresses torts in United States law. As such, it covers primarily common law. Moreover, it provides general rules, as individual states all have separate civil codes. There are three general categories of torts: intentional torts, negligence, and strict liability torts.\n\nIntentional torts involve situations in which the defendant desires or knows to a substantial certainty that his act will cause the plaintiff damage. They include battery, assault, false imprisonment, intentional infliction of emotional distress (\"IIED\"), trespass to land, trespass to chattels, conversion, invasion of privacy, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, fraud, inducing breach of contract, intentional interference with business relations, and defamation of character (libel/slander).\n\nThe elements of most intentional torts follow the same pattern: intent, act, result, and causation.\n\nThis element typically requires the defendant to desire or know to a substantial certainty that something will occur as a result of his act. Therefore, the term intent, for purposes of this section, always includes either desire or knowledge to a substantial certainty.\n\nFor an example in battery, Dave shoots a gun into a crowd of people because he is specifically trying to hit someone with a bullet. This element would be satisfied, as David had an actual desire to procure the harm required for this tort. Alternatively, Dave shoots a gun into a crowd of people for some reason and genuinely hopes no one gets hit but knows that it is virtually inevitable that someone will actually get hit. This element would still be satisfied, as David had knowledge to a substantial certainty that harm would result.\n\nIn contrast, if all that can be said about the defendant's state of mind is that he \"should have\" known better, he will not be liable for an intentional tort. This situation might occur if, as opposed to the examples above, Dave shoots a gun in a remote part of the desert without looking just for fun, not wanting to hit anyone, but the bullet does hit someone. Dave did not have a desire or knowledge to a substantial certainty that someone would get hit in this situation. He may, however, be liable for some other tort, namely negligence.\n\nTransferred intent is the legal principle that intent can be transferred from one victim or tort to another. [1] In tort law, there are generally five areas in which transferred intent is applicable: battery, assault, false imprisonment, trespass to land, and trespass to chattels. Generally, any intent to cause any one of these five torts which results in the completion of any of the five tortious acts will be considered an intentional act, even if the actual target of the tort is one other than the intended target of the original tort.\n\nThe element of an act varies by whatever tort is in question but always requires voluntariness. For example, if Dave has a muscle spasm that makes his arm fling out to his side and hit Paula, who is standing next to him, any case that Paula attempts to bring against Dave for battery will fail for lack of the requisite act (which will be discussed in the section on battery, below). The act was not voluntary.\n\nThis element typically refers to damage, although damage is not required to prevail on certain intentional torts, such as trespass to land.\n\nThis element refers to actual cause and proximate cause. It will be treated in its own section.\n\nA person commits a battery when he acts either intending to cause a harmful or offensive contact with another or intending to cause another imminent apprehension of such contact and when such contact results. Therefore, there is a variety of ways in which a person can commit a battery, as illustrated by the following examples of defendant Dave and plaintiff Paula.\n\n\nApprehension is a broader term than fear. If a defendant intends to cause the plaintiff to actually fear a harmful contact, for example, it will therefore always suffice as apprehension, but there are other ways to achieve apprehension as well.\n\nAssault is notably similar to battery. Indeed, the elements of intent and act are identical. The only difference is the result. A person commits an assault when he acts either intending to cause a harmful or offensive contact with another or intending to cause another imminent apprehension of such contact and when such imminent apprehension results. Therefore, there is a variety of ways in which a person can commit an assault.\n\nA person commits false imprisonment when he acts intending to confine another and when confinement actually results that the confinee is either aware of or damaged by.\n\nConfinement must typically be within boundaries that the defendant establishes. For example, a person is not confined when he is refused entry to a building, because he is free to leave. In addition, a person is not confined unless the will to leave of an ordinary person in the same situation would be overborne. For example, Dave calls Paula into a room with one door. Dave closes the door and stands in front of it. He tells Paula that if she wants to leave, he will open the door and get out of her way but also threatens to blink twice if she does so. An ordinary person's will to leave would not be overborne by Dave's threat to blink twice.\n\nNo damage is required in false imprisonment, hence the requirement of a result of awareness \"or\" damage. For example, Dave calls Paula into a room with one door. Dave closes the door and stands in front of it. He tells Paula that if she wants to leave, he will take out a gun and shoot her. (Note that this \"would\" overcome the will of an ordinary person to leave.) An hour later, Dave changes his mind and leaves the premises. Paula subsequently leaves and is not physically injured at all. Her awareness of confinement is sufficient to satisfy the element of the result in false imprisonment.\n\nAlternatively, Paula is a narcoleptic. She suddenly falls into a deep sleep while feeding the chickens in a barn on Dave's farm in a remote area. Not wanting to move her, Dave locks her in the barn from the outside when he needs to go into town, trying to protect her but also knowing that she won't be able to leave (or call for help) if she wakes up. While Dave is away, the chickens severely scratch Paula's arms, but she does not wake up. Dave returns, unlocks the barn, and successfully wakes up Paula to tend to her wounds. Even though she was unaware of her confinement, she was damaged by it and will have a claim of false imprisonment against Dave.\n\nA person is liable for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) when he intentionally \"or recklessly\" engages in extreme and outrageous conduct that is highly likely to cause \"severe\" emotional distress.\n\nThis is a notable exception to the general rule given above that for almost all intentional torts only desire or knowledge to a substantial certainty will do. IIED also includes recklessness. This still distinguishes it from negligent infliction of emotional distress, though.\n\nExtreme and outrageous conduct refers to the act. Severe emotional distress refers to the result. This is another intentional tort for which no damage is ordinarily required. However, some jurisdictions require the accompaniment of physical effects. In other words, emotional distress will not be deemed to exist in those jurisdictions unless there are physical manifestations, such as vomiting or fainting.\n\nA person commits trespass to land when he wrongfully and intentionally enters, or causes a thing or third person to enter, land owned or occupied by another.\n\nA person commits trespass to chattel when he acts either intending to dispossess the rightful possessor of a chattel or intending to use or \"intermeddle\" with the chattel of another and when dispossession of the chattel for a substantial time results, or damage to the chattel results, or physical injury to the rightful possessor results.\n\nA person commits conversion when he acts intending to exercise \"dominion and control\" and when interference with the rightful possessor's control results that is so serious that it requires the actor to pay the full value of the chattel to the rightful possessor. An exercise of dominion and control refers to the act. Serious interference refers to the result. Seriousness is determined by the following factors:\nThe remedy for this cause of action not only requires the defendant to pay the plaintiff the full value of the chattel but also is properly considered a forced sale. The plaintiff must tender the defendant the chattel. Therefore, a plaintiff may not elect to pursue this cause of action but instead trespass to chattel, namely when he wants to keep his chattel despite its potential damage.\n\n\nThe following are affirmative defenses to intentional torts.\n\nConsent can be a defense to any intentional tort, although lack of consent is occasionally incorporated into the definition of an intentional tort, such as trespass to land. However, lack of consent is not always an essential element to establish a prima facie case in such situations. Therefore, it is properly treated as an affirmative defense.\n\nSelf-defense is typically a defense to battery. Similar to self-defense is the defense of others.\n\nThis is typically a defense to trespass to land or trespass to chattels, as it can refer to realty or personalty.\n\nNecessity is typically a defense to trespass to land. There are two kinds of necessity, private and public.\n\nThis is a partial privilege. A party who has this privilege is still liable for damage caused. This defense is therefore more important when there is a concomitant issue of whether the opposing party has a valid privilege of defense of property.\n\nThe following example is derived from an actual Vermont case from 1908. Paula is sailing on a lake when a violent storm suddenly breaks out. She navigates to the nearest dock and quickly ties up her vessel, not damaging the dock at all. The dock belongs to Dave. Dave attempts to exercise the privilege of defense of property, as Paula would ordinarily be committing a trespass to land in this situation, and unties the vessel. Paula therefore drifts back away from the shore. Her boat is damaged, and she suffers personal injuries, both as a result of the storm.\n\nIf Paula had damaged Dave's dock, she would be liable for it, even though she has a valid privilege of private necessity. More importantly, Dave is now liable to Paula for the damage to her boat and for her personal injuries. Because of the private necessity, Paula is not considered a trespasser. So, Dave did not in fact have a valid privilege of defense of property.\n\nOrdinarily, for private necessity to be valid, the party attempting to exercise it must not have created the emergency. For example, if Paula intentionally punctures her fuel tank just so she can race over to Dave's dock and tie up, she will not have a valid privilege of private necessity. As such, she would be a trespasser, and Dave would have a valid privilege of defense of property.\n\nThis is a complete privilege. A party who has this privilege, typically a public official or governmental entity, is not liable for any damage caused. A famous early case on this privilege involved John W. Geary, the first mayor of San Francisco, who made the decision during a major fire to burn down several private residences to establish a fire break.\n\nAmongst unintentional torts one finds negligence as being the most common source of common law. Most Americans are under the impression that most people can sue for any type of negligence, but it is untrue in most US jurisdictions (partly because negligence is one of the few torts for which ordinary people can and do obtain liability insurance.) It is a form of extracontractual liability that is based upon a failure to comply with the duty of care of a reasonable person, which failure is the actual cause and proximate cause of damages. That is, but for the tortfeasor's act or omission, the damages to the plaintiff would not have been incurred, and the damages were a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the tortious conduct.\n\nSome jurisdictions recognize one or more designations less than actual intentional wrongdoing, but more egregious than mere negligence, such as \"wanton\", \"reckless\" or \"despicable\" conduct. A finding in those states that a defendant's conduct was \"wanton,\" \"reckless\" or \"despicable\", rather than merely negligent, can be significant because certain defenses, such as contributory negligence, are often unavailable when such conduct is the cause of the damages.\n\n\nBreach is ordinarily established by showing that the defendant failed to exercise reasonable care. Some courts use the terms ordinary care or prudent care instead. Conduct is typically considered to be unreasonable when the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. Judge Learned Hand famously reduced this to algebraic form in \"United States v. Carroll Towing Co.\":\nThis means that if the burden of exercising more care is less than the probability of damage or harm multiplied by the severity of the expected loss, and a person fails to undertake the burden, he is not exercising reasonable care and is thus breaching his duty to do so (assuming he has one). In other words, the burden of prevention is less than the probability that the injury will occur multiplied by the gravity of the harm/injury. Under this formula, duty changes as circumstances change—if the cost of prevention increases, then the duty to prevent decreases; if the likelihood of damage or the severity of the potential damage increases, then duty to prevent increases.\n\nThere are other ways of establishing breach, as well.\n\n\nThis is also known as negligence per se. Breach can be shown in most jurisdictions if a defendant violates a statute that pertains to safety and the purpose of which is to prevent the result of the case. Note that this is an alternative way to show breach. A violation of statute will not have occurred in every case. Therefore, just because it cannot be shown does not mean that there has been no breach. Even if it is attempted to be shown but fails, there may be other bases of breach.\n\nOccasionally, there is a valid excuse for violating a safety statute, namely when it is safer or arguably safer to violate than to comply with it. This happened in \"Tedla v. Ellman\". A statute required pedestrians using roadways to walk against traffic. At the time in question, there was heavy traffic going the opposite direction as the plaintiff. Therefore, the plaintiff would have had to walk past many more vehicles, arguably increasing his chances of being hit. So, the plaintiff walked with traffic on the other side of the road, thus violating the statute. There were far fewer vehicles travelling that direction, but the plaintiff was hit anyway. Even though the purpose of the statute was to prevent precisely the result that occurred, the plaintiff nonetheless prevailed because of a valid excuse for violating the statute, namely that it was probably safer not to comply.\n\nBreach can be shown in most jurisdictions if a defendant violates a custom that is widespread and itself reasonable. For example, where ten percent of a certain industry does a certain thing, it probably will not be considered a custom for purposes of breach in negligence. Alternatively, if 90 percent of a certain industry does a certain thing, but the thing is inherently unsafe, and it is upholding the custom as a cost-saving measure, violation of that custom (doing something safer) will not constitute breach. As with violation of statute, this is an alternative way to show breach. Therefore, just because it cannot be shown, or is attempted to be shown but fails, does not mean that there has been no breach. There may be other ways of showing breach.\n\nThis is a Latin phrase that means \"the thing speaks for itself.\" It is a rare alternative basis of breach. Ordinarily, it only applies when the plaintiff has little or limited access to the evidence of negligent conduct. Res ipsa loquitur requires that the defendant have exclusive control over the thing that causes the injury and that the act be one that would not ordinarily occur without negligence.\n\nCausation is typically a bigger issue in negligence cases than intentional torts. However, as mentioned previously, it is an element of any tort. The defendant's act must be an actual cause and a proximate cause of the result in a particular cause of action.\n\nActual cause has historically been determined by the \"but for\" test. If the result would not have occurred but for the defendant's act, the act is an actual cause of the result.\n\nSeveral other tests have been created to supplement this general rule, however, especially to deal with cases in which the plaintiff suffers great harm, yet because multiple acts by multiple defendants, the but for test is unhelpful. This situation occurred in the famous case of \"Summers v. Tice\". For example, Dan and Dave both negligently fire their shotguns at Paula. Paula is struck by only one pellet and it is impossible to determine which gun it was fired from. Using the but for test alone, Dan and Dave can both escape liability. Dan can say that but for his own negligence, Paula still might have suffered the same harm. Dave can make the same argument. As a matter of public policy, most courts will nonetheless hold Dan and Dave jointly and severally liable. The act of each defendant is therefore said to be an actual cause, even if this is a fiction.\n\nA similar situation arises when it is impossible to show that the defendant(s) was/were negligent at all. This almost inevitably arises in cases also involving res ipsa loquitor. See Ybarra v. Spangard. For example, making the facts of that case more extreme, Paula goes to the hospital for an appendectomy. She wakes up, and finds her left arm has also been amputated for no apparent reason. (Note that this would implicate multiple issues and other causes of action than negligence.) For purposes of actual cause, unless there is evidence or an admission of negligent conduct, Paula will be unable to show an actual cause. In this situation too, most courts will hold all the defendants that Paula names (possibly everyone on the medical staff that was in the room during her surgery) jointly and severally liable. The act of each defendant is likewise said to be an actual cause, even if this is a fiction.\n\nAnother test deals with cases in which there are two actual causes but only one is negligent. For example, there are three equidistant points, A, B, and C. Paula's house is at point A. Dave negligently ignites a fire at point B. Lightning simultaneously strikes point C, starting a second fire. The fire at point B and the fire at point C both burn towards point A. Paula's house burns down. Unlike \"Summers v. Tice\", there is only one defendant in this situation. Most courts will still hold Dave's negligence to be an actual cause, as his conduct was a \"substantial factor\" in causing Paula's damage. This is sometimes called the substantial factor test.\n\n\nThere are many tests for determining whether an actual cause is a proximate one. Most involve some form of foreseeability.\n\nJustice Cardozo has two factors to determine if there was a proximate cause between the plaintiff's injury and the defendant's breach of duty:\n\nJustice Andrews has several factors to determine if there was a proximate cause between the plaintiff's injury and the defendant's breach of duty:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPunitive damages (sums intended to punish the defendant) may be awarded in addition to actual damages intended to compensate the plaintiff. Punitive damage awards generally require a higher showing than mere negligence, but lower than intention. For instance, grossly negligent, reckless, or outrageous conduct may be grounds for an award of punitive damages. These punitive damages awards can be quite substantial in some cases.\n\n\nStrict liability torts are brought for injuries resulting from ultrahazardous activities, for which the defendant will be held liable even if there was no negligence on his/her part. Strict liability also applies to some types of product liability claims and to copyright infringement and some trademark cases. Some statutory torts are also strict liability, including many environmental torts. The term \"strict liability\" refers to the fact that the tortfeasor's liability is not premised on their culpable state of mind (whether they knew or intended to accomplish the wrongful act, or violated a standard of care by doing so,) but, instead, strictly on the conduct itself or its result.\n\nProduct liability refers to the liability of manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers for unreasonably dangerous products.\n\n\nAlthough federal courts often hear tort cases arising out of common law or state statutes, there are relatively few tort claims that arise exclusively as a result of federal law. The most common federal tort claim is the 42 U.S.C. § 1983 remedy for violation of one's civil rights under color of federal or state law, which can be used to sue for anything from a free speech claim to use of excessive force by the police. Tort claims arising out of injuries occurring on vessels on navigable waters of the United States fall under federal admiralty jurisdiction.\n\n"}

Hudson and Goodwin, 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) 32 (1812), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court held that Congress must first enact a constitutional law criminalizing an activity, attach a penalty, and give the federal courts jurisdiction over the offense in order for the court to render a conviction.\n\nBarzillai Hudson and George Goodwin, the defendants in the case, were charged with a libel on the President and Congress, and of having accused them of secretly voting to give Napoleon Bonaparte $2 million to make a treaty with Spain. The circuit court was divided on whether it could exercise common law jurisdiction over such cases.\n\nJustice William Johnson, Jr. delivered the opinion of the Court. He first explained that the federal government is one of limited powers, as set forth in the Constitution. Furthermore, only the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court was explicitly defined in Article III of the U.S. Constitution. Since the lower federal courts were created by Congress with the Judiciary Act of 1789, their jurisdiction had to be defined by Congress. Therefore, the Court reasoned that since Congress has the power to create such courts, the principles of limited government militate in favor of limiting their jurisdiction to specific acts specified by Congress.\n\nThe Court held, \"The legislative authority of the Union must first make an act a crime, affix a punishment to it, and declare the Court that shall have jurisdiction of the offence.\" In dicta, he also mentioned an exception to the general rule. Courts have some implied powers, such as punishing litigants for contumacy (contempt of court) and enforcing court orders.\n\nThe case effectively closed the door on the lower federal courts' powers to convict defendants for common law crimes and mandated for Congress to define their criminal jurisdiction specifically through legislation. Thus, the court essentially introduced the legal concept of \"nulla poena sine lege\" into federal jurisprudence.\n\n\n\n"}

It is located in the capital of the country – Kiev. The library contains about 15 million items. The library has the most complete collection of Slavic writing, archives of outstanding world and Ukrainian scientists and cultural persons. The holdings include the collection of the Presidents of Ukraine, archive copies of Ukrainian printed documents from 1917, and archives of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine.\n\nVernadsky National Library of Ukraine was established on 2 August 1918 by Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi as the \"National Library of the Ukrainian State\" (\"Natsionalna biblioteka Ukrayinskoyi Derzhavy\"). On 23 August 1918 there was established the Provisional Committee on creation of the National Library headed by Vladimir Vernadsky (Volodymyr Vernadsky).\n\nIn August 1941 the library was evacuated to Ufa, the capital of Bashkortostan, where it was housed in the State pedagogical institute. In May 1944 the library returned to Kiev.\n\nThe current building was constructed between 1975 and 1989. It has 27 floors and an area of 35,700 m². Its roof reaches 76.7 m and its antenna 78.6 m above ground.\n\nThe collection of the Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine contains more than 15 million items. Its basis form the large book collections of 18th-19th centuries.\n\nAs a depository library the Library has systematic acquisition.

This waiting period allows the state to perform a background check to confirm that the purchaser is legally permitted to possess a firearm. In theory, waiting periods may also be in place to serve as a \"cooling off\" period for potential buyers who may wish to commit crimes in the \"heat of the moment\".\nStudies have shown that just a 3 day waiting period can reduce the number of homicides that will occur in a state by 17%. Some states have already adopted a waiting period before one can purchase a firearm. In the state of California, the waiting period is 10 days. Moreover, someone who has previously passed the background check and was able to purchase a firearm will still be subject to the same 10 day waiting period before obtaining another firearm.\n\nWaiting periods are also used for new insurance policies, particularly health insurance and flood insurance. Incidents which occur during this time are not claimable. The term may also refer to the time between the making of a claim and the payment of it, also called the elimination period.\n\nIn business finance, a waiting period (or quiet period) is the time in which a company making an initial public offering (IPO) must be silent about it, so as not to inflate the value of the stock artificially. It is also called the cooling-off period.\n\nOther things potentially subject to waiting periods include marriage, divorce, and merger proceedings.\n"}

As Curtis could not pay up front for the boat, Williams loaned him the money, with the boat being used as security for the loan.\n\nThe choice of Curtis however turned out to be most unfortunate, as he was a drug smuggler who later became renowned as one of New Zealand's most infamous criminals. In 1979, soon after the sale, Curtis beached the yacht near Westport whilst smuggling drugs into the country.\n\nAs well as arresting him for this, Customs seized the boat. In 1982, William managed to get the Minister for Customs to waive the seizure order, however Customs had simply left the boat moored unattended at Westport, resulting in it being damaged and vandalized.\n\nWilliams sued Customs for the damage, and was awarded $80,000 in damages.\n"}

Levine, 555 U.S. 555 (2009), is a United States Supreme Court case holding that Federal regulatory clearance of a medication does not shield the manufacturer from liability under state law.\n\nThe plaintiff lost her hand to gangrene when she was injected with Phenergan, an anti-nausea drug made by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals. She won a jury verdict in Vermont, under the theory (\"inter alia\") that Wyeth had inadequately labeled the drug.\n\nThe trial record shows that the FDA first cleared injectable Phenergan for use in 1955. In 1973 and 1976, Wyeth submitted supplemental new drug applications, which the agency cleared after proposing labeling changes. Wyeth submitted a third supplemental application in 1981 in response to a new FDA rule governing drug labels. Over the next 17 years, Wyeth and the FDA intermittently corresponded about Phenergan's label. The most notable activity occurred in 1987, when the FDA suggested different warnings about the risk of arterial exposure, and in 1988, when Wyeth submitted revised labeling incorporating the proposed changes. The FDA did not respond. Instead, in 1996, it requested from Wyeth the labeling then in use and, without addressing Wyeth's 1988 submission, instructed it to \"retain verbiage in [the] current label\" regarding intra-arterial injection. After a few further changes to the labeling not related to intra-arterial injection, the FDA cleared Wyeth's 1981 application in 1998, instructing that Phenergan's final printed label \"must be identical\" to the approved package insert.\n\nWyeth argued that this Vermont law was federally preempted because it was in \"actual conflict [with] a specific FDA order\" regarding drug labeling. The trial court rejected this argument, as did the Supreme Court of Vermont, holding that the FDA requirements merely provide a floor, not a ceiling, for state regulation. The Supreme Court granted certiorari.\n\nIf a drug meets the labeling requirements of the FDA, does that give rise to federal preemption of state law regarding inadequate labeling? Wyeth presented two arguments in favor of FDA Preemption:\n\nJustice John Paul Stevens, writing on behalf of a 6-3 court, rejected both of Wyeth's arguments. In other words, the Vermont law was not preempted (or overruled) by FDA regulations; thus, the plaintiff could argue her case before a state court jury.\n\nQuestions of federal preemption \"must be guided by two cornerstones of our pre-emption jurisprudence\":\n\nIn its first argument, Wyeth is incorrect that relabeling the drug to conform to Vermont law would necessarily have violated federal labeling regulations.\n\nIn its second argument, Wyeth is incorrect that permitting states to require stronger warnings would interfere with Congress' purpose of entrusting an expert agency with drug labeling decisions because it was not Congress's intent, in writing the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, to preempt state-law failure to warn actions.\n\nJustice Breyer noted that, while the issue was not present here, the FDA may create regulations that pre-empt state law tort claims.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas wrote separately, concurring only in the judgment. He criticized the majority for implicitly endorsing a \"far-reaching implied pre-emption doctrine\" where the Court can invalidate state laws based on perceived conflicts with federal statutes by extrapolating from evidence not found in the text of the statute.\n\nJustice Samuel A. Alito dissented and was joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts and Justice Antonin Scalia. He disagreed with the Court's holding that a jury, rather than the FDA, is ultimately responsible for regulating warning labels for prescription drugs. He argued this is incompatible with \"Geier v. American Honda Motor Co.\", which established the principles of conflict preemption.\n\n\n\n"}
