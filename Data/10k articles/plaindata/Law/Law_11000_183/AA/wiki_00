Bauman's argument is that allosemitism can represent a “radically ambivalent attitude,” that encompassing both Philo-Semitism and anti-Semitism; allosemitism is a form of proteophobia, fear and horror of things that defy clean-cut categories, not, like antisemitism, of a simple fear of the \"other\" (heterophobia); and that Judeophobia is diverse, and, therefore, not adequately encompassed by the term antisemitism.\n\nRuth Gruber describes the neologism as a response to \"the idea that, good or bad, Jews are different from the non-Jewish mainstream and thus unable to be dealt with in the same way or measured by the same yardstick.\" According to Gruber, the term was coined by Polish-Jewish literary critic Artur Sandauer.\n\nIn her 2010 book \"Modernism, Feminism, and Jewishness\", literary scholar Maren Tova Linnett describes the term as originated by both Sandauer and Bauman.\n\nLinnett uses the term \"to describe the multiple modes of difference that these women authors ascribed to the Jew in order to complicate what she views as the overly simplistic polarities of anti-Semitism and philo-Semitism.\"\n\nSociologist Eliezer Ben-Rafael employs the concept in his 2014 book \"Confronting Allosemitism in Europe: The Case of Belgian Jews.\"\n\n"}

However, this account is flawed as the possibility of Oughtred being the son of Edwin is fanciful and cannot be substantiated. It would have been impossible for Oughtred to have been Bowbearer of Gilsland before the 1170s when the barony was first brought into the Norman realm. Prior to that, it had formed part of the kingdom of the Scots .\n\nAfter the early fourteenth century, it is often difficult to distinguish between Bowbearers and Master Foresters in the Bowland record:\n\nBowbearers of Bowland (1150–1304)\n\n\nMaster Foresters and Bowbearers of Bowland (1304–1650)\n\n\nBowbearers of Bowland after 1660\n\n\nPerhaps the most notorious Bowbearer of the Forest of Bowland was Sir Nicholas Tempest, who was executed at Tyburn in 1537. Tempest was one of the northern leaders of the Pilgrimage of Grace, the Catholic uprising against Henry VIII and was linked to Sawley Abbey.\n\nThe Parker family were the Bowbearers of the Forest of Bowland from the time of the English Restoration in 1660. The family likes to claim the office traces back as far as Robert Parker in the early 16th century but this is difficult to substantiate given the available evidence. In reality, while the family did have Bowbearers over many generations between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, the office was always granted to them by their local lord, the Lord of Bowland, the so-called Lord of the Fells. \n\nThe Parker hereditary claim appears to have been concocted in the early part of the nineteenth century by Thomas Lister Parker, a socially ambitious individual who wished to make a mark in London society. Thomas Lister Parker eventually bankrupted himself due to his various extravagances but not before he had corrupted the historical record. Both Whitaker's and Baines' accounts of the history of Bowland bear witness to that corruption. The last known Bowbearer of the Forest of Bowland was Richard Eastwood of Thorneyholme, an acclaimed breeder of racehorses and shorthorn cattle and land agent to John Towneley, 13th Lord of Bowland. Eastwood died in 1871 and is buried at St Hubert's, Dunsop Bridge.\n\nAlthough the Lord of Bowland's courts at Whitewell that appointed the Bowbearers fell into disuse in the first half of the nineteenth century, it was reported in April 2010 that William Bowland, 16th Lord of Bowland had re-asserted his ancient right and appointed Robert Parker of Browsholme Hall his Bowbearer of the Forest of Bowland, the first Parker to be so appointed in more than 150 years. \n\nIn 2011, Robert Parker led a party of dignitaries from the Bowland Higher Division Parish Council, the Forest authorities, and local community, to welcome the 16th Lord of Bowland to Dunsop Bridge on his first official visit to the Forest. In October 2012, Robert Parker was formally presented with his Bowbearer's \"wand of office\" by the 16th Lord of Bowland at a public ceremony in Slaidburn. This ceremony marked the 90th anniversary of the final meeting of the manorial court at the town's Tudor courthouse.\n\nOther notable examples of Bowbearers in England include those appointed in the Forests of Delamere, Hatfield, and Mashamshire.\n\nIn 1513, a Richard Done of Utkington is described as the hereditary Bowbearer of Delamere.\n\nIn 1605, Sir Robert Swift of Streetthorpe (Edenthorpe) was appointed Bowbearer to the Royal Chase of Hatfield by James I. A local tradition in that area states that the many yew trees of the region were planted as a result, to provide wood for bows. The Complete Shakespeare Encyclopedia by Carol Enos also states that \"Alvanley Hall, the property of William Arden, Baron Alvanley, has been abandoned as the residence of the family for nearly a century and a half, and little of the house remains. Lord Alvanley is hereditary Bowbearer of the Forest of Delamere, and possesses the ancient bugle horn by which his ancestors have held that office almost from the period of the Norman Invasion” (Chetham Society,Vol I, 331).\" \n\nIn 1632, Sir Francis Armitage of Kirklees, was appointed Bowbearer of the Free Chase of Mashamshire.\n\nThe bowbearer is not a uniquely English phenomenon. There was an officer to the king, described as a \"bowbearer\", in ancient Persia. The officers in most close attendance on the monarch's person were, in war, his charioteer, his stoolbearer, his bowbearer, and his quiverbearer; in peace, his parasolbearer, and his fanbearer, who was also privileged to carry what has been termed \"the royal pocket-handkerchief\".\n\n"}

The case established the extent of the Exclusive Economic Zone of the French territory of Saint Pierre and Miquelon.\n\nIn 1972, Canada and France signed a treaty that delimited the territorial maritime boundary between Canada and the French territory of Saint Pierre and Miquelon. However, the maritime boundaries beyond the territorial sea (including extent of the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) of both countries) continued to be disputed. The extent of each country's EEZ was significant because it would determine where the countries had an exclusive right to fish. Years of failed negotiations led Canada and France to agree in March 1989 to establish an ad hoc arbitral tribunal that would resolve the dispute.\n\nThe arbitral tribunal was composed of five arbitrators—three neutral parties and one representative from each country. The neutral arbitrators were Eduardo Jiménez de Aréchaga of Uruguay (president), Gaetano Arangio-Ruiz of Italy, and Oscar Schachter of the United States. Canada's representative was Allan Gotlieb and France's was Prosper Weil.\n\nThe arbitral tribunal issued its decision and award on 10 June 1992. It was a 3–2 decision, with the representatives of both Canada and France dissenting from the decision. The zone that was awarded to France was unusual and in two parts: first, the boundary was set at an equidistant line between the French islands and the Canadian island of Newfoundland. Added to this was a 24 nautical mile bulge on the west of the islands. Lastly, a long north–south corridor south of the islands was awarded to France, presumably to allow France access to its EEZ from international waters without having to pass through the Canadian EEZ. The corridor is narrow, being approximately 10½ nautical miles wide. The shape of the award has been likened to a keyhole, a mushroom, and a baguette.\n\nThe award was approximately 18% of the territory that France had initially been claiming.\n\nSince the 1992 award, the decision has been criticised by both Canadian and French commentators as well as neutral observers. Some have noted that a straightforward application of the Convention on the Law of the Sea would extend Canada's EEZ beyond the limits of the French corridor, meaning that the French EEZ may be entirely enveloped within Canada's EEZ, a circumstance that was not intended by the arbitral tribunal.\n\n\n"}

Bill McIlroy, then Secretary of the National Secular Society (NSS), officiated, and happened to remark that perhaps one day COs would be commemorated, as armed forces personnel are, both nationally and locally in the places where they lived.\n\nEdna Mathieson, niece of Joseph Brett, and a member of the Inner London Education Authority (sub group of the Greater London Council), approached the GLC for help, and in 1981 the GLC Labour Group accepted the idea and the Greater London Regional Labour Party agreed. But when, after the abolition of the GLC in 1986, the London Residuary Board took over the GLC’s commitments, agreement to a physical commemoration of COs was lost. Mathieson turned to Lambeth Council, and Lambeth initiated a competition in all London art schools for a suitable piece of sculpture, to be set up next to County Hall (GLC's headquarters), situated in Lambeth. Lambeth Council then found that, because of cuts, it could not afford to sponsor the arrangements for such a monument.\n\nFinally, Mathieson approached the PPU, who agreed to help with the whole concept, including design, location and raising finances. Camden Council (its local council) was asked for permission to erect a stone in Tavistock Square. On 15 May 1993, International Conscientious Objectors' Day, a public appeal was launched by means of a letter in \"The Guardian\", headed by Sir Michael Tippett.\n\nGranite had been considered as material, as it is the strongest stone – symbolic of those who refused against the odds to fight. However, when the PPU’s architectural adviser, Hugh Court, and sculptor, Paul Wehrle, went to Cumbria in search of a stone, they were so attracted to a naturally shaped piece of grey-green volcanic slate, some 400 million years old and rather larger than the size originally envisaged, they chose that.\n\nThe PPU decided upon the form of words for the stone with an addition of “Their foresight and courage give us hope”, written by a Dublin wordsmith.\n\nIn 1998 Mathieson pressed for the rest of Bill McIlroy's idea to be implemented - an annual event for the commemoration of all COs. A planning group was established at a Conway Hall meeting (in the Bertrand Russell Room) and Jess Hodgkins, a Unitarian, suggested the group be called the Right to Refuse to Kill Group (RRK). Ever since there has been an annual memorial event every year at noon on 15 May, International Conscientious Objectors' Day.\n\nAround the left, top, and right edges:\nIn the centre:\nAlong the bottom edge:\nAlso in Tavistock Square is a statue of Mahatma Gandhi, sculpted by Fredda Brilliant and installed in 1968 and a cherry tree planted in 1967 in memory of the victims of the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nWith the Conscientious Objectors Commemorative Stone, the three features have led to the square unofficially being regarded by some as a peace park or garden. Annual ceremonies are held at each of these memorials including International Conscientious Objectors Day, 15 May.\n\n\n"}

They can be sold and bought and then used by criminals and criminal organizations. Alternatively, an employee may choose to deliberately abuse trusted access to information for the purpose of exposing misconduct by the employer; From the perspective of the society such an act of whistleblowing can be seen as positive and is in certain situations protected by law in some jurisdictions, such as the USA.\n\nA common scenario is where a sales person makes a copy of the contact database for use in their next job.

One problem with the commercialization of this cement, other than the conservatism of the building industry, is that the feedstock magnesite is rarely mined.\n\nOrdinary Portland cement requires a kiln temperature of around 1450 °C. The reactive magnesia in Eco-Cement requires a lower kiln temperature of 750 °C, which lowers the energy requirements, and hence the use of fossil fuels and emission of carbon dioxide (CO).\n\nEco-Cement sets and hardens by sequestering CO from the atmosphere and is recyclable. The rate of absorption of CO varies with the degree of porosity and the amount of MgO. Carbonation occurs quickly at first and more slowly towards completion. A typical Eco-Cement concrete block would be expected to fully carbonate within a year.\n\nEco-Cement is able to incorporate a greater number of industrial waste products as aggregate than Portland cement as it is less alkaline. This reduces the incidence of alkali-aggregate reactions which cause damage to hardened concrete.

{"id": "6171623", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6171623", "title": "Energy recovery ventilation", "text": "Energy recovery ventilation\n\nEnergy recovery ventilation (ERV) is the energy recovery process of exchanging the energy contained in normally exhausted building or space air and using it to treat (precondition) the incoming outdoor ventilation air in residential and commercial HVAC systems. During the warmer seasons, the system pre-cools and dehumidifies while humidifying and pre-heating in the cooler seasons. The benefit of using energy recovery is the ability to meet the ASHRAE ventilation & energy standards, while improving indoor air quality and reducing total HVAC equipment capacity.\n\nThis technology has not only demonstrated an effective means of reducing energy cost and heating and cooling loads, but has allowed for the scaling down of equipment. Additionally, this system will allow for the indoor environment to maintain a relative humidity of 40% to 50%. This range can be maintained under essentially all conditions. The only energy penalty is the power needed for the blower to overcome the pressure drop in the system.\n\nNearly half of global energy is used in buildings, and half of heating/cooling cost is caused by ventilation when it is done by the \"open window\" method according to the regulations [define method and include citation]. Secondly, energy generation and grid is made to meet the peak demand of power. To use proper ventilation; recovery is a cost-efficient, sustainable and quick way to reduce global energy consumption and give better indoor air quality (IAQ) and protect buildings, and environment.\n\nAn energy recovery ventilator (also abbreviated ERV) is a type of air-to-air heat exchanger that not only transfers sensible heat but also latent heat. Because both temperature and moisture are transferred, ERVs can be considered total enthalpic devices. On the other hand, a heat recovery ventilator (HRV) can only transfer sensible heat. HRVs can be considered \"sensible only\" devices because they only exchange sensible heat. In other words, whereas all ERVs are HRVs, not all HRVs are ERVs, but many people use the terms HRV, AAHX (air-to-air heat exchanger), and ERV interchangeably.\n\nThroughout the cooling season, the system works to cool and dehumidify the incoming, outside air. This is accomplished by the system taking the rejected heat and sending it into the exhaust airstream. Subsequently, this air cools the condenser coil at a lower temperature than if the rejected heat had not entered the exhaust airstream. During the heating seasons, the system works in reverse. Instead of discharging the heat into the exhaust airstream, the system draws heat from the exhaust airstream in order to pre-heat the incoming air. At this stage, the air passes through a primary unit and then into a space. With this type of system, it is normal, during the cooling seasons, for the exhaust air to be cooler than the ventilation air and, during the heating seasons, warmer than the ventilation air. It is for this reason the system works very efficiently and effectively. The coefficient of performance (COP) will increase as the conditions become more extreme (i.e., more hot and humid for cooling and colder for heating).\n\nThe efficiency of an ERV system is the ratio of energy transferred between the two air streams compared with the total energy transported through the heat exchanger.\n\nWith the variety of products on the market, efficiency will vary as well. Some of these systems have been known to have heat exchange efficiencies as high as 70-80% while others have as low as 50%. Even though this lower figure is preferable to the basic HVAC system, it is not up to par with the rest of its class. Studies are being done to increase the heat transfer efficiency to 90%.\n\nThe use of modern low-cost gas-phase heat exchanger technology will allow for significant improvements in efficiency. The use of high conductivity porous material is believed to produce an exchange effectiveness in excess of 90%. By exceeding a 90% effective rate, an improvement of up to five factors in energy loss can be seen.\n\nThe Home Ventilation Institute (HVI) has developed a standard test for any and all units manufactured within the United States. Regardless, not all have been tested. It is imperative to investigate efficiency claims, comparing data produced by HVI as well as that produced by the manufacturer. (Note: all units sold in Canada are placed through the R-2000 program, a standard test synonymous to the HVI test).\n\n<nowiki>**</nowiki>Total energy exchange only available on hygroscopic units and condensate return units\n\nThe rotating wheel heat exchanger is composed of a rotating cylinder filled with an air permeable material resulting in a large surface area. The surface area is the medium for the sensible energy transfer. As the wheel rotates between the ventilation and exhaust air streams it picks up heat energy and releases it into the colder air stream. The driving force behind the exchange is the difference in temperatures between the opposing air streams which is also called the thermal gradient. Typical media used consists of polymer, aluminum, and synthetic fiber.\n\nThe enthalpy exchange is accomplished through the use of desiccants. Desiccants transfer moisture through the process of adsorption which is predominately driven by the difference in the partial pressure of vapor within the opposing air-streams. Typical desiccants consist of silica gel, and molecular sieves.\n\nEnthalpy wheels are the most effective devices to transfer both latent and sensible energy but there are many different types of construction that dictate the wheel's durability. The most common materials used in the construction of the rotor are Polymer, Aluminum and Fiberglass.\n\nWhen using rotary energy recovery devices the two air streams must be adjacent to one another to allow for the local transfer of energy. Also, there should be special considerations paid in colder climates to avoid wheel frosting. Systems can avoid frosting by modulating wheel speed, preheating the air, or stop/jogging the system.\n\nFixed plate heat exchangers have no moving parts, and consist of alternating layers of plates that are separated and sealed. Typical flow is cross current and since the majority of plates are solid and non permeable, sensible only transfer is the result.\n\nThe tempering of incoming fresh air is done by a heat or energy recovery core. In this case, the core is made of aluminum or plastic plates. Humidity levels are adjusted through the transferring of water vapor. This is done with a rotating wheel either containing a desiccant material or permeable plates.\n\nEnthalpy plates were introduced 2006 by Paul, a special company for ventilation systems for passive houses. A crosscurrent countercurrent air-to-air heat exchanger built with a humidity permeable material. Polymer fixed-plate countercurrent energy recovery ventilators were introduced in 1998 by Building Performance Equipment (BPE), a residential, commercial, and industrial air-to-air energy recovery manufacturer. These heat exchangers can be both introduced as a retrofit for increased energy savings and fresh air as well as an alternative to new construction. In new construction situations, energy recovery will effectively reduce the required heating/cooling capacity of the system. The percentage of the total energy saved will depend on the efficiency of the device (up to 90% sensible) and the latitude of the building.\n\nDue to the need to use multiple sections, fixed plate energy exchangers are often associated with high pressure drop and larger footprints. Due to their inability to offer a high amount of latent energy transfer these systems also have a high chance for frosting in colder climates.\n\nThe technology patented by Finnish company RecyclingEnergy Int. Corp. is based on a regenerative plate heat exchanger taking advantage of humidity of air by cyclical condensation and evaporation, e.g. latent heat, enabling not only high annual thermal efficiency but also microbe-free plates due to self-cleaning/washing method. Therefore the unit is called an enthalpy recovery ventilator rather than heat or energy recovery ventilator. Company´s patented LatentHeatPump is based on its enthalpy recovery ventilator having COP of 33 in the summer and 15 in the winter.\n\n"}
{"id": "8348744", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8348744", "title": "Fusionism", "text": "Fusionism\n\nIn American politics, fusionism is the philosophical and political combination or \"fusion\" of traditionalist and social conservatism with political and economic right-libertarianism. The philosophy is most closely associated with Frank Meyer.\n\nThe philosophy of \"fusionism\" was developed at \"National Review\" magazine during the 1950s under the editorship of William F. Buckley, Jr. and is most identified with his associate editor Frank Meyer. As Buckley recounted the founding he \"brokered\" between \"an extraordinary mix\" of libertarians, traditional conservatives, anti-communists and even an anarchist to produce the ideas and writings that produced modern conservatism. He identified Meyer's synthesis as the most likely best solution of defining conservatism.\n\nIn his most influential book, \"In Defense of Freedom\", Meyer defined freedom in what Isaiah Berlin would label \"negative\" terms as the minimization of the use of coercion by the state in its essential role of preventing one person's freedom from intruding upon another's. The state should protect freedom but otherwise leave virtue to individuals. The state has only three legitimate functions – police, military and operating a legal system, all necessary to control coercion, which is immoral if not restricted. Virtue is critical for society and freedom must be balanced by responsibility but both are inherently individual in form. Coerced values cannot be virtuous. Freedom by itself has no goal, no intrinsic end. Freedom is not abstract or utopian as with the utilitarians, who also make freedom an end rather than a means. In a real society traditional order and freedom can only exist together. The solution is a philosophical synthesis of both freedom and tradition, the solution to the dilemma is \"grasping it by both horns\" and accepting the tension between the two.\n\nFusionism's most famous advocate was Ronald Reagan as an early admirer of National Review and associate of both editors. On assuming the presidency in 1981, he met with conservative leaders around the country in Washington and reminded them of their intellectual roots. After listing \"intellectual leaders like Russell Kirk, Friedrich Hayek, Henry Hazlitt, Milton Friedman, James Burnham, [and] Ludwig von Mises\" as the ones who \"shaped so much of our thoughts,\" he discussed only one of these influences at length:\n\nAs he recalled him, the new president outlined the ideas Meyer synthesized as the principles for this new conservative movement.\n\nFusionism saw its height during the presidency of Ronald Reagan, who had brought together the divided factions after Gerald Ford's loss in the 1976 election. Rich Lowry has argued that Reagan maintained a fusionist 'sweet spot' of both ideological flexibility and respect for conservative principles. In the immediate aftermath of the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994, fusionism was also at its height. The social conservative element of the Republican Party was seen on the ascent (at least with respect to domestic politics) during the presidency of George W Bush. Increased spending angered traditional conservatives, fiscal conservatives, and libertarians. In addition, the long-standing tensions between neoconservatives and paleoconservatives bubbled over in the wake of the Iraq War.\n\nWisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan said during a June 2009 Hudson Institute conference speech:\n\nWhile both these principles are traditionally conservative, the equal emphasis of traditional morality and free markets is a characteristic of fusionism.\n\nFollowing the Republican Party's defeat in the 2006 midterm elections, some were calling for a new \"fusionism\" between libertarians and liberals in the Democratic Party to address what is seen as increasing governmental interference in private activity. The results of the 2008 elections and the financial crisis of 2007–2008 have brought renewed tension between the libertarians and the social conservatives with centrist economic views.\n\nFusionists tend to see the unpopularity of George W. Bush's Keynesian economic stimulus policies, his \"compassionate conservatism,\" such as in his new entitlement prescription drug program, and his party's following defeat by President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, as reasons requiring a fusionist renewal if conservatism was ever to regain the presidency.\n\nIn a polemic, the traditional conservative philosopher Russell Kirk, quoting T. S. Eliot's expression called libertarians \"chirping sectaries\". Adding that although conservatives and libertarians share opposition to collectivism, the totalist state and bureaucracy, have otherwise nothing in common. He called the libertarian movement \"an ideological clique forever splitting into sects still smaller and odder, but rarely conjugating.\" Stating that a line of division exists between believers in \"some sort of transcendent moral order\" and \"utilitarians admitting no transcendent sanctions for conduct.\" He included libertarians in the latter category. Kirk had questioned fusionism between libertarians and traditional conservatives that marked much of post-World War II conservatism in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "489558", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=489558", "title": "General Mobile Radio Service", "text": "General Mobile Radio Service\n\nThe General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS) is a land-mobile FM UHF radio service designed for short-distance two-way communication. It requires a license in United States but some GMRS compatible equipment can be used license-free in Canada. The United States permits use by adult individuals who possesses a valid GMRS license, as well as their immediate family members. Immediate relatives of the GMRS system licensee are entitled to communicate among themselves for personal or business purposes, but employees of the licensee who are not family members are not covered by the license   non-family members must be licensed separately.\n\nGMRS radios are typically handheld portable devices much like Family Radio Service (FRS) radios, and share the FRS frequency band near 462 and 467 MHz. Mobile and base station-style radios are available as well, but these are normally commercial UHF radios as often used in the public service and commercial land mobile bands. These are legal for use in this service as long as they are GMRS type-approved.\n\nAny individual in the United States who is at least 18 years of age and not a representative of a foreign government may apply for a GMRS license by completing the application form, either on paper or online through the FCC's Universal Licensing System. No exam is required. A GMRS license is issued for a 10 year term.\nThe fee is $70 for most applicants.\n\nA GMRS individual license extends to immediate family members and authorizes them to use the licensed system. GMRS license holders are allowed to communicate with FRS users on those frequencies that are shared between the two services. GMRS individual licenses do not extend to employees.\n\nNew GMRS licenses are being issued only to individuals. Prior to 31 July 1987, the FCC issued GMRS licenses to non-individuals (corporations, partnerships, government entities, etc.). These licensees are grandfathered and may renew but not make major modifications to their existing licenses.\n\nIn any case, each GMRS station must be identified by transmission of its FCC-assigned call sign at the end of a transmission or a series of transmissions, and at least once every 15 minutes for a series lasting more than 15 minutes. The call sign may be spoken or sent with audible tones using Morse code. A repeater station handling properly identified transmissions of others is not required to send its own station identification (47 CFR §95.1751).\n\nAs with other UHF radio services, reliable range is considered to be line-of-sight and the distance to the radio horizon can be estimated based on antenna height. Theoretically, the range between two hand-held units would be about one or two miles (about 1.5–3 km); mobile units have higher antennas and a range of around 5 miles (8 km). A GMRS repeater with an antenna that is high above the surrounding terrain can extend the usable range over a wide area – for example, up to a 20 mile (32.2 km) radius around the repeater station. Obstructions such as hills and buildings can reduce range. Higher power does not necessarily give a proportional increase in range, although it may improve the reliability of communication at the limits of line-of-sight distance.\n\nThe GMRS-only channels are defined in pairs, with one frequency in the 462 MHz range for simplex and repeater outputs, and another in the 467 MHz frequency range for repeater inputs. There are eight channels exclusively for GMRS and seven \"interstitial\" channels shared with Family Radio Service. GMRS use requires an FCC license, and licensees are permitted to transmit at up to 50 watts on GMRS frequencies, depending on the type of station, but 1 to 5 Watts is more common. Units are allowed to have detachable or external antennas.\n\nGMRS licensees are also able to use the first seven of the FRS frequencies (the \"interstitial\" GMRS frequencies) with a few limitations. Specifically, they may be used as long as one-way pages are not transmitted, communications are limited to voice, and transmission power (ERP) does not exceed 5 Watts (FCC Code §95.29, section f). This allows GMRS users to transmit on a total of 15 channels. FRS channels 8 through 14 are not available for GMRS use; use of these frequencies requires an FRS transceiver, or a hybrid transceiver operating under FRS rules.\n\nHybrid FRS/GMRS consumer radios have been introduced with 22 channels, instead of the 14 channels associated with FRS. On this type of radio, transmitting on shared FRS/GMRS channels 1–7 requires a license if using more than 0.5 Watt. Channels 8–14 are strictly license-free FRS channels. Transmitting on GMRS-only channels 15–22 requires a license. It is the responsibility of the radio user to read and understand all applicable rules and regulations regarding GMRS. These hybrid radios are often referred to as \"bubble pack\" radios, since they are often packed in a plastic shell, for hanging on a display shelf. The massive sales of these radios have led to the term \"bubble-pack pirates\", persons who use GMRS without a license.\n\nEffective 28 September 2017, FCC revised the definition of the FRS service. FRS operation is now permitted with up to 2 Watts on the shared FRS / GMRS channels. The FCC will not grant type acceptance for hybrid radios that would exceed the limits for the FRS service on the FRS channels. Current \"hybrid\" FRS/GMRS radios will not require a GMRS license for power up to 2 Watts, but FRS radios will still not be permitted to use the input frequencies of GMRS repeaters. Any radio exceeding the limits of the new FRS service will be classified as a GMRS radio.\n\nThe FCC rules for use of hybrid radios on channels 1–7 require licensing only when operating under the rules that apply to the GMRS. Many hybrid radios have an ERP that is lower than a half-watt on channels 1–7, or can be set by the user to operate at low power on these channels. This allows hybrid radios to be used under the license-free FRS rules if the ERP is less than one half watt and the unit is certified for FRS operation. Only two makers of hybrid FRS / GMRS radios (Garmin and Motorola) presently sell radios that will operate on the GMRS repeater channels; the common \"22 channel\" radios cannot be used with GMRS repeaters. The Icom IC-F21GM is a solely-GMRS radio that will also work with repeaters. FRS rules permit only 2.5 kHz (Narrowband FM) frequency deviation on the FRS shared channels. GMRS uses ±5 kHz deviation on the GMRS channels.\n\nEffective 30 September 2019, it becomes unlawful in the USA to import, manufacture, sell, or offer to sell radio equipment capable of operating under both GMRS and FRS.\n\nNew GMRS/FRS Frequency chart effective 28 September 2017.\n\nIn the table below, the so-called \"Friendly Name\" of a frequency is the portion of the frequency to the right of the decimal (the kHz portion). For example: the \"friendly name\" for 462.550 MHz is \"550\".\n\nThis first set of frequencies shows the split frequency pairs used in duplex operational mode, often used with repeaters. Simplex (same frequency for receiving and transmitting) mode only utilizes the lower set of frequencies.\n\nGMRS radio channels in the table below use 5 kHz deviation and 25 kHz channel bandwidth although some \"bubble pack\" combo FRS/GMRS radios utilize 2.5 kHz deviation. For best compatibility of audio level, 5 kHz deviation should be used when communicating with GMRS equipment. The 4-digit decimal GMRS frequencies (shared FRS 1-7 / ICOM 9-15) are spaced 12.5 kHz from the (ICOM 1-8) GMRS frequencies, and may receive interference from other nearby stations. It may be advisable to use 12.5 kHz narrow-band (NFM) in congested areas, or avoid their use as a last resort.\n\nThis second set of frequencies shows the interstitial ranges shared with the Family Radio Service services. These frequencies can only be used for simplex operations.\n\nThis third set of frequencies are for FRS use \"only\" and are not part of the General Mobile Service. They are included here to show the remaining interstices of the 467 MHz frequency band.\n\nThe predecessor to GMRS was named Class A Citizens Radio Service when it was rolled out in the 1960s. Tube type transceivers were used, and transmitter power was limited to 60 watts (plate input power to the final amplifier tube). The original service ran wideband FM with ±15 kHz transmitter deviation and 50 kHz channel spacing. At the time, this was the norm for all U.S. land mobile services. There was also a Class B Citizens Radio Service which used a different set of 461 MHz channels and was limited to 5 Watts output. Business users were permitted to license in this radio service. Radios were built by consumer electronics firms and commercial two-way radio vendors.\n\nIn the 1960s, the UHF 450–470 MHz band was re-allocated to 25 kHz channels. This meant transmitter deviation was reduced to ±5 kHz. This doubled the number of channels available across the entire 450–470 MHz band. Class B Citizens Radio Service channels were re-allocated to other radio services.\n\nIn the 1970s, allowed power was again changed to 50 Watts across the output terminals of the transmitter. In 1987, licensing of business users was discontinued and businesses were allowed to continue operating until their licenses expired. There was congestion on all channels in larger metropolitan statistical areas and moving businesses to Business Radio Service channels would provide some relief. The radio service was changed to its present name; General Mobile Radio Service or GMRS.\n\nIn 2010 the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) proposed removing the individual licensing requirement. In 2015, the FCC ruled to keep the license requirement, but to remove the regulator fee for licensing. Adopted on 20 May 2015, the ruling would be in effect after a 90 day notification period to Congress; the fee will not be eliminated before 18 August 2015. The fee for a 5 year license was $90.00, with the regulatory fee portion of the license at $5 per year (or $25 for the 5 year life of the license). After the notification period, the fee for a 5 year license was to become $65.00 . The change became effective on 3 September 2015.\n\nThe use of radio transmitters is regulated by national laws and international agreements. Often radio equipment accepted for use in one part of the world may not be operated in other parts due to conflicts with frequency assignments and technical standards. Some of the roles that the licensed GMRS service fills in the United States are, in other countries, filled by unlicensed or class-licensed services. Generally these services have strict technical standards for equipment to prevent interference with licensed transmitters and systems.\n\nIn Canada, hand-held GMRS radios up to 2 Watts have been approved for use without a license since September 2004. Typically these are dual FRS and GMRS units, with fixed antennas, and operating at 2 Watts on some GMRS channels and 0.5 Watt on the FRS-only channels. Mobile units (permanently mounted in vehicles), base stations and repeaters are not currently permitted on the GMRS channels in Canada.\n\nOther countries have licensed and unlicensed personal radio services with somewhat similar characteristics, but technical details and operating conditions vary according to national rules. Many European countries use a similar 8 channel system near 446 MHz known as PMR446, as well as a 69 channel low-power LPD433 which is shared with the ISM band. GMRS equipment that is approved for use in the United States will not communicate with PMR446 radios due to using different frequency ranges.\n\n\n"}

Launched on April 24, 2012, Google Drive allows users to store files on their servers, synchronize files across devices, and share files. In addition to a website, Google Drive offers apps with offline capabilities for Windows and macOS computers, and Android and iOS smartphones and tablets. Google Drive encompasses Google Docs, Sheets and Slides, an office suite that permits collaborative editing of documents, spreadsheets, presentations, drawings, forms, and more. Files created and edited through the office suite are saved in Google Drive.\n\nGoogle Drive offers users with 15 gigabytes of free storage though Google One. Google One also offers 100 gigabytes, 200 gigabytes, 2 terabytes 10 terabytes, 20 terabytes, and 30 terabytes offered through optional paid plans. Files uploaded can be up to 5 terabytes in size. Users can change privacy settings for individual files and folders, including enabling sharing with other users or making content public. On the website, users can search for an image by describing its visuals, and use natural language to find specific files, such as \"find my budget spreadsheet from last December\".\n\nThe website and Android app offer a Backups section to see what Android devices have data backed up to the service, and a completely overhauled computer app released in July 2017 allows for backing up specific folders on the user's computer. A Quick Access feature can intelligently predict the files users need.\n\nGoogle Drive is a key component of G Suite, Google's monthly subscription offering for businesses and organizations. As part of select G Suite plans, Drive offers unlimited storage, advanced file audit reporting, enhanced administration controls, and greater collaboration tools for teams.\n\nFollowing the launch of the service, Google Drive privacy policy was heavily criticized by some members of the media. Google has one set of Terms of Service and Privacy Policy agreements that cover all of its services, meaning that the language in the agreements grants the company broad rights to reproduce, use, and create derivative works from content stored on Google Drive. While the policies also confirm that users retain intellectual property rights, privacy advocates raised concerns that the licenses grant Google the rights to use the information and data to customize advertising and other services Google provides. In contrast, other members of the media noted that the agreements were no worse than those of competing cloud storage services, but that the competition uses \"more artful language\" in the agreements, and also stated that Google needs the rights in order to \"move files around on its servers, cache your data, or make image thumbnails\".\n\n, Google Drive has 800 million active users, and as of September 2015, it has over one million organizational paying users. , there are over two trillion files stored on the service.\n\nGoogle Drive was introduced on April 24, 2012 with apps available for Windows, macOS, and Android, as well as a website interface. The iOS app was released in June 2012.\n\nGoogle Drive is available for PCs running Windows 7 or later, and Macs running OS X Lion or later. Google indicated in April 2012 that work on Linux software was underway, but there was no news on this as of November 2013. In April 2012, Google's then-Senior Vice President Sundar Pichai said that Google Drive would be tightly integrated with Chrome OS version 20. In October 2016, Google announced that, going forward, it will drop support for versions of the computer software older than 1 year. In June 2017, Google announced that a new app called Backup and Sync would replace the existing separate Google Drive and Google Photos desktop apps, creating one unified app on desktop platforms. Originally intended for release on June 28, its release was delayed until July 12. In September 2017, Google announced that it will discontinue the Google Drive desktop app in March 2018 and end support in December 2017.\n\nIn July 2017, Google announced their new downloadable software, Backup and Sync. It was made mainly to replace the Google Drive desktop app, which was discontinued. Its main function is for the user to be able to set certain folders to constantly sync onto their Google account's Drive. The synced folders and files count against the shared quota allocated between Gmail, Google Photos, and Google Drive.\n\nGoogle Drive is available for Android smartphones and tablets running Android 4.1 \"Jelly Bean\" or later, and iPhones and iPads running iOS 8 or later.\n\nIn August 2016, Google Drive ended support for Android devices running Android 4.0 \"Ice Cream Sandwich\" or older versions, citing Google's mobile app update policy, which states: \"For Android devices, we provide updates for the current and 2 previous Android versions.\" According to the policy, the app will continue to work for devices running older Android versions, but any app updates are provided on a best-efforts basis. The policy also states a notice will be given for any planned end of service.\n\nGoogle Drive has a website that allows users to see their files from any Internet-connected computer, without the need to download an app.\n\nThe website received a visual overhaul in 2014 that gave it a completely new look and improved performance. It also simplified some of the most common tasks, such as clicking only once on a file to see recent activity or share the file, and added drag-and-drop functionality, where users can simply drag selected files to folders, for improved organization.\n\nA new update in August 2016 changed several visual elements of the website; the logo was updated, search box design was refreshed, and the primary color was changed from red to blue. It also improved the functionality to download files locally from the website; users can now compress and download large Drive items into multiple 2 GB .zip files with an improved naming structure, better Google Forms handling, and empty folders will now be included in the .zip, thereby preserving the user's folder hierarchy.\n\nGoogle gives every user 15 GB of free storage though Google One, Google Docs, Sheets and Slides files do not count towards the storage limit. This cloud storage is also shared with Gmail and Google Photos. An unlimited number of photos at maximum 16 megapixels and videos at maximum 1080p resolutions are stored for free using the \"High quality\" setting in Google Photos. Using the \"Original quality\" setting uses Google Drive quota.\n\nUsers can purchase additional space through either a monthly or yearly payment. The option of yearly payments was introduced in December 2016, and is limited to the 100 GB or 1 TB storage plans. Furthermore, the yearly payments offer a discount. In May 2018, Google announced that storage plans (including the free 15 gigabyte plan) would be moved over to Google One.\n\n, these are the storage plans offered by Google:\nChromebook users can obtain 100 GB of Google Drive storage free for 2 years as long as the promotion is activated within 180 days of the Chromebook device's initial purchase. This is available in all countries where Google Drive is available. Offer can only be redeemed once per device. Used, open-box, and refurbished devices are not eligible for the offer.\n\nGoogle offers 30 GB of Drive storage for all G Suite Basic customers, and unlimited storage for those using G Suite Business or G Suite for Education, as long as there are at least 5 members. Associations with less than 5 members get 1 TB per user.\n\nBefore the introduction of Google Drive, Google Docs initially provided 15 GB of storage free of charge.\nOn April 24, 2012, Google Drive was introduced with free storage of 5 GB. Storage plans were revised, with 25GB costing $2.49/month, 100GB costing $4.99/month and 1TB costing $49.99/month.\n\nOriginally, Gmail, Google Docs and Picasa had separate allowances for free storage and a shared allowance for purchased storage. Between April 2012 and May 2013, Google Drive and Google+ Photos had a shared allowance for both free and purchased storage, whereas Gmail had a separate 10 GB storage limit, which increased to 25 GB on the purchase of any storage plan.\n\nIn September 2012, Google announced that a paid plan would now cover total storage, rather than the paid allocation being added to the free; e.g. a 100 GB plan allowed a total of 100 GB rather than 115 GB as previously.\n\nIn May 2013, Google announced the overall merge of storage across Gmail, Google Drive and Google+ Photos, allowing users 15 GB of unified free storage between the services.\n\nIn March 2014, the storage plans were revised again and prices were reduced by 80% to $1.99/month for 100 GB, $9.99/month for 1TB, and $99.99/month for 10 TB. This was much cheaper than competitors Dropbox and OneDrive offered at the time.\n\nIn 2018, the paid plans were re-branded as Google One to emphasize their application beyond Google Drive, along with the addition of a $2.99/month plan for 200 GB, and increasing the $9.99 plan to 2 TB at no additional charge.\n\nIn most cases during these changes, users could continue with their existing plans as long as they kept their accounts active and did not make any adjustments to the plan. However, if the account lapsed for any reason, users had to choose from current plans.\n\nGoogle Drive incorporates a system of file sharing in which the creator of a file or folder is, by default, its owner. The owner can regulate the public visibility of the file or folder. Ownership is transferable. Files or folders can be shared privately with particular users having a Google account, using their \"@gmail.com\" email addresses. Sharing files with users not having a Google account requires making them accessible to \"anybody with the link\". This generates a secret URL for the file, which may be shared via email or private messages. Files and folders can also be made \"public on the web\", which means that they can be indexed by search engines and thus can be found and accessed by anyone. The owner may also set an access level for regulating permissions. The three access levels offered are \"can edit\", \"can comment\" and \"can view\". Users with editing access can invite others to edit.\n\nA number of external web applications that work with Google Drive are available from the Chrome Web Store. To add an app, users are required to sign into the Chrome Web Store, but the apps are compatible with all supported web browsers. Some of these apps are first-party, such as Google Docs, Sheets and Slides. Drive apps operate on the online files, and can be used to view, edit and create files in various formats, edit images and videos, fax and sign documents, manage projects, create flowcharts, etc. Drive apps can also be made the default for handling file formats supported by them. Some of these apps also work offline on Google Chrome and Chrome OS.\n\nAll of the third-party apps are free to install. However, some have fees associated with continued usage or access to additional features. Saving data from a third-party app to Google Drive requires authorization the first time.\n\nThe Google Drive software development kit (SDK) works together with the Google Drive user interface and the Chrome Web Store to create an ecosystem of apps that can be installed into Google Drive. In February 2013, the \"Create\" menu in Google Drive was revamped to include third-party apps, thus effectively granting them the same status as Google's own apps.\n\nIn March 2013, Google released an API for Google Drive that enables third-party developers to build collaborative apps that support real-time editing.\n\nThe Google Drive viewer on the web allows the following file formats to be viewed:\n\nFiles in other formats can also be handled through third-party apps that work with Google Drive, available from the Chrome Web Store.\n\nFiles uploaded, but not converted to Google Docs, Sheets, or Slides formats, may be up to 5 TB in size. There are also limits, specific to file type, listed below:\n\n\n\n\nIntroduced in the Android app in September 2016, Quick Access uses machine learning to \"intelligently predict the files you need before you've even typed anything\". The feature was announced to be expanded to iOS and the web in March 2017, though the website interface received the feature in May.\n\nSearch results can be narrowed by file type, ownership, visibility, and the open-with app. Users can search for images by describing or naming what is in them. For example, a search for \"mountain\" returns all the photos of mountains, as well as any text documents about mountains. Text in images and PDFs can be extracted using optical character recognition. In September 2016, Google added \"natural language processing\" for searching on the Google Drive website, enabling specific user search queries like \"find my budget spreadsheet from last December\". In February 2017, Google integrated Drive and the Google Search app on Android, letting users search for keywords, switch to an \"In Apps\" tab, and see any relevant Drive files.\n\nIn December 2016, Google updated the Android app and website with a \"Backups\" section, listing the Android device and app backups saved to Drive. The section lets users see what backups are stored, the backups' sizes and details, and delete backups.\n\nIn June 2017, Google announced that a new app, \"Backup and Sync\", would be able to synchronize any folder on the user's computer to Google. The app was released on July 12, 2017.\n\nA Description field is available for both files and folders that users can use to add relevant metadata. Content within the Description field is also indexed by Google Drive and searchable.\n\nIn June 2014, Google announced a number of updates to Google Drive, which included making the service more accessible to visually impaired users. This included improved keyboard accessibility, support for zooming and high contrast mode, and better compatibility with screen readers.\n\nGoogle offers an extension for Google Chrome, \"Save to Google Drive\", that allows users to save web content to Google Drive through a browser action or through the context menu. While documents and images can be saved directly, webpages can be saved in the form of a screenshot (as an image of the visible part of the page or the entire page), or as a raw HTML, MHTML, or Google Docs file. Users need to be signed into Chrome to use the extension.\n\nThe main Google Drive mobile app supported editing of documents and spreadsheets until April 2014, when the capability was moved to separate, standalone apps for Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides. The Google Drive app on Android allows users to take a photo of a document, sign, or other text and use optical character recognition to convert to text that can be edited. In October 2014, the Android app was updated with a Material Design user interface, improved search, the ability to add a custom message while sharing a file, and a new PDF viewer.\n\nBefore 2013, Google did not encrypt data stored on its servers. Following information that the United States' National Security Agency had \"direct access\" to servers owned by multiple technology companies, including Google, the company began testing encrypting data in July and enabled encryption for data in transit between its data centers in November. However, as of 2015, Google Drive does not provide client-side encryption.\n\nGoogle Drive for Work is a business version, a part of G Suite (formerly Google Apps for Work), announced at the Google I/O conference on June 25, 2014 and made available immediately. The service features unlimited storage, advanced file audit reporting and eDiscovery services, along with enhanced administration control and new APIs specifically useful to businesses. Users can upload files as large as 5 TB. A press release posted on Google's Official Enterprise Blog assured businesses that Google will encrypt data stored on its servers, as well as information being transmitted to or from them. Google will deliver 24/7 phone support to business users and has guaranteed 99.9% uptime for its servers.\n\nIn September 2015, Google announced that Google Drive for Work would be compliant with the new ISO/IEC 27018:2014 security and privacy standard, which confirmed that Google would not use data in Drive for Work accounts for advertising, enabled additional tools for handling and exporting data, more transparency about data storage, and protection from third-party data requests.\n\nIn March 2017, Google introduced Drive File Stream, making it possible for G Suite customers on Windows and macOS computers to search their Drive folders and download specific files on-demand rather than downloading all files during installation, potentially preventing large amounts of data from \"gobbling up your hard drive\". Additionally, the feature will guess what files users need in the future and download those files as well.\n\nGoogle Drive for Education was announced on September 30, 2014. It was made available for free to all Google Apps for Education users. It includes unlimited storage and support for individual files up to 5TB in size in addition to full encryption.\n\nIn September 2016, Google announced Team Drives, a new way for teams to collaborate. Sharing and file ownership are managed for the entire team rather than one individual, and new users instantly get access to all files and information. In November, Google opened an Early Adopter Program, allowing G Suite Business and G Suite for Education customers to sign up, although Google noted that some functionality isn't yet supported by Team Drives.\n\nGoogle Docs, Google Sheets, Google Slides, and Google Forms constitute a free, web-based office suite offered by Google and integrated with Google Drive. It allows users to create and edit documents, spreadsheets, and presentations online while collaborating in real-time with other users. The three apps are available as web applications, as Chrome apps that work offline, and as mobile apps for Android and iOS. The apps are compatible with Microsoft Office file formats. The suite also consists of Google Forms, Google Drawings and Google Fusion Tables. While Forms and Tables are only available as web applications, Drawings is also available as a Chrome app. The suite is tightly integrated with Google Drive, and all files created with the apps are by default saved to Google Drive.\n\nUpdates to Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Forms have introduced features using machine learning, including \"Explore\", offering search results based on the contents of a document, answers based on natural language questions in a spreadsheet, and dynamic design suggestions based on contents of a slideshow, and \"Action items\", allowing users to assign tasks to other users.\nWhile Google Docs has been criticized for lacking the functionality of Microsoft Office, it has received praise for its simplicity, ease of collaboration and frequent product updates.\n\nIn order to view and edit Docs, Sheets, or Slides documents offline, users need to be using the Google Chrome web browser. A Chrome extension, \"Google Docs Offline\", allows users to enable offline support for Docs, Sheets and Slides files on the Google Drive website.\n\nGoogle also offers an extension for the Google Chrome web browser called \"Office editing for Docs, Sheets and Slides\" that enables users to view and edit Microsoft Office documents on Google Chrome, via the Docs, Sheets and Slides apps. The extension can be used for opening Office files stored on the computer using Chrome, as well as for opening Office files encountered on the web (in the form of email attachments, web search results, etc.) without having to download them. The extension is installed on Chrome OS by default.\n\nGoogle Drawings allows users to collaborate creating, sharing, and editing images or drawings. Google Drawings can be used for creating charts, diagrams, designs, flow-charts, etc. It contains a subset of the features in Google Slides but with different templates. Its features include laying out drawings precisely with alignment guides, snap to grid, auto distribution, and inserting drawings into other Google documents, spreadsheets, or presentations.\n\nIn a review of Google Drive after its launch in April 2012, Dan Grabham of \"TechRadar\" wrote that the integration of Google Docs into Google Drive was \"a bit confusing\", mainly due to the differences in the user interfaces between the two, where Drive offers a \"My Drive\" section with a specific \"Shared with me\" view for shared documents. He stated that \"We think the user interface needs a lot more work. It's like a retread of Google Docs at the moment and Google surely needs to do work here\". He considered uploading files \"fairly easy\", but noted that folder upload was only supported through the Google Chrome web browser. The lack of native editing of Microsoft Office documents was \"annoying\". Regarding Google Drive's computer apps, he stated that the option in Settings to synchronize only specific folders was \"powerful\". He wrote that Drive was \"a great addition to Google armoury of apps and everything does work seamlessly\", while again criticizing the interface for being \"confusing\" and that the file view was \"not quite intuitive enough\" without file icons. Grabham also reviewed the mobile Android app, writing that \"it's a pretty simple app that enables you to access your files on the move and save some for offline access should you wish\", and praised Google Docs creation and photo uploading for being \"easy\". He also praised that \"everything is easily searchable\".\n\nA review by Michael Muchmore of \"PC Magazine\" in February 2016 praised the service as \"truly impressive\" in creating and editing files, describing its features as \"leading\" in office-suite collaboration. He added that \"Compatibility is rarely an issue\", with importing and exporting options, and that the free storage of 15 gigabytes was \"generous\". However, he also criticized the user interface for being confusing to navigate, and wrote that \"Offline editing isn't simple\".\n\nThe Android version of Google Drive has been criticized for requiring users to individually toggle each file for use offline instead of allowing entire folders to be stored offline.\n\nImmediately after its announcement in April 2012, Google faced criticism over Google Drive privacy. In particular, privacy advocates have noted that Google has one unified set of Terms of Service and Privacy Policy agreements for all its products and services. In a \"CNET\" report, Zack Whittaker noted that \"the terms and service have come under heavy fire by the wider community for how it handles users' copyright and intellectual property rights\". In a comparison of Terms of Service agreements between Google Drive and competing cloud storage services Dropbox and OneDrive, he cited a paragraph stating that Google has broad rights to reproduce, use, and create derivative works from content stored on Google Drive, via a license from its users. Although the user retains intellectual property rights, the user licenses Google to extract and parse uploaded content to customize advertising and other services that Google provides to the user, and to promote the service. Summarized, he wrote that \"According to its terms, Google does not own user-uploaded files to Google Drive, but the company can do whatever it likes with them\". In a highly critical editorial of the service, Ed Bott of \"ZDNet\" wrote that language in the agreements contained \"exact same words\" as Dropbox used in a July 2011 Privacy Policy update that sparked criticism and forced Dropbox to update its policy once again with clarifying language, adding that \"It's a perfect example of Google's inability to pay even the slightest bit of attention to anything that happens outside the Googleplex\". Matt Peckham of \"Time\" criticized the lack of unique service agreements for Drive, writing that \"If any Google service warrants privacy firewalling, it’s Google Drive. This isn’t YouTube or Calendar or even Gmail——the potential for someone’s most sensitive data to be snooped, whether to glean info for marketing or otherwise, is too high. [...] Google ought to create a privacy exception that “narrows the scope” of its service terms for Google Drive, one that minimally states the company will never circulate the information generated from searching your G-Drive data in any way.\"\n\nIn contrast, a report by Nilay Patel of \"The Verge\" stated that \"all web services should be subject to harsh scrutiny of their privacy policies—but a close and careful reading reveals that Google's terms are pretty much the same as anyone else's, and slightly better in some cases\", pointing to the fact that Google \"couldn't move files around on its servers, cache your data, or make image thumbnails\" without proper rights. In comparing the policies with competing services, Patel wrote that \"it's clear that they need the exact same permissions—they just use slightly more artful language to communicate them\".\n\nOn November 12, 2013, Google announced that Google Drive had 120 million active users, a figure that the company was releasing for the first time.\n\nOn June 25, 2014 at the Google I/O developer conference, Sundar Pichai announced that Google Drive now had 190 million monthly active users, and that it was being used by 58% of the Fortune 500 companies as well as by 72 of the top universities.\n\nOn October 1, 2014, at its Atmosphere Live event, it was announced that Google Drive had 240 million monthly active users. \"The Next Web\" noted that this meant an increase of 50 million users in just one quarter.\n\nOn September 21, 2015, it was announced that Google Drive had over one million organizational paying users.\n\nIn March 2017, Google announced that Google Drive had 800 million active users.\n\nIn May 2017, a Google executive stated at a company event that there were over two trillion files stored on Google Drive.\n\nAlthough Google has a 99.9% uptime guarantee for Google Drive for G Suite customers, Google Drive has suffered downtimes for both consumers and business users. During significant downtimes, Google's App Status Dashboard gets updated with the current status of each service Google offers, along with details on restoration progress. Notable downtimes occurred in March 2013, October 2014, January 2016, and September 2017.\n\nWhen the January 2016 outage was resolved, a Google spokesperson told \"The Next Web\":\n\nAt Google we recognize that failures are statistically inevitable, and we strive to insulate our users from the effects of failures. As that did not happen in this instance, we apologize to everyone who was inconvenienced by this event. Our engineers are conducting a post-mortem investigation to determine how to make our services more resilient to unplanned network failures, and we will do our utmost to continue to make Google service outages notable for their rarity.\nIn an outage that affected all of Google's services for 5 minutes in August 2013, CNET reported that global Internet traffic dropped 40%.\n\n\n"}

Although recommending that a tax lawyer and an accountant review her letter for accuracy, she proceeded to provide the letter to the promoters, knowing it would form part of their information package. The letter stated that the transactions would be implemented based on supporting documents that she had been provided with and had reviewed. However, she had not reviewed the supporting documents.\n\nA charity with which Guindon was connected agreed to become the recipient of the promoted timeshares. In reality, no timeshare units were created and no transfers from the donors to the charity occurred. The Minister of National Revenue later disallowed the charitable donation tax credits claimed by the donors, and Guindon was assessed an administrative monetary penalty in 2008 for each of the tax receipts disallowed, amounting in total to almost $600,000.\n\nGuindon appealed the assessment to the Tax Court of Canada, submitting that s. 163.2 of the \"Income Tax Act\" created a criminal offence, and thus was subject to the \"Charter\" protection afforded under s.11.\n\nThe TCC held that s. 163.2 was \"by its very nature a criminal proceeding\" and \"involve[d] a sanction that is a true penal consequence,\" and in consequence vacated the assessment. Protests by the Crown that the constitutional issue was raised without proper notice were overruled by the trial judge Bédard J.\n\nThe Federal Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, set aside the TCC's judgment, and restored the assessment against Guindon. In his ruling, Stratas JA held that:\n\n\nLeave to appeal to the SCC was granted in June 2013.\n\nBy a unanimous decision, the appeal was dismissed. However, the Justices split 4:3 as to whether the constitutional issue should have been considered without prior notice, and only the majority addressed the constitutional issue.\n\nWhile the minority considered the Court's prior ruling in \"Eaton v Brant County Board of Education\" as requiring a mandatory notice of a constitutional question, as it \"gives governments an opportunity to present evidence justifying the constitutionality of the law and permits all parties to challenge that evidence,\" and \"allowing a party unilaterally to make an end-run around notice requirements by claiming that demonstrably constitutional arguments are not in fact constitutional arguments, rewards linguistic tactics at the expense of the public interest.\" The majority held that \"Eaton\" was not conclusive, as Sopinka J's judgment did not express a final opinion on the point. In addition, there have been numerous instances both before and after \"Eaton\" where the Court has addressed constitutional questions \"de novo\" without prior notice.\n\nS. 11 protection is available to those charged with criminal offences, not those subject to administrative sanctions, according to the test the Court has devised in \"R v Wigglesworth\", which declares that a matter falls under s. 11 where;\n\n\nIn addition, \"Martineau v MNR\" declares that, in general, \"proceedings of an administrativeprivate, internal or disciplinarynature instituted for the protection of the public in accordance with the policy of a statute are not penal in nature.\" To determine whether a proceeding is criminal or administrative in nature, the Court must examine \"(1) the objectives of the [Act]; (2) the purpose of the sanction; and (3) the process leading to imposition of the sanction.\"\n\nIn the present case, the Court declared that criticisms that the \"Wigglesworth/Martineau\" tests were unclear, circular in nature or not properly accounting for the modern context of administrative monetary penalties were unfounded, as:\n\n\nIn the case at bar, s. 163.2(4) of the \"ITA\" was held:\n\n\nSeveral practical consequences were immediately apparent in \"Guindon\":\n\n\nCommentators generally agree that \"Guindon\" is only a first step in the development of the case law concerning administrative proceedings:\n\n"}

Architects, designers, and builders typically design and build them using a range of established strategies, techniques, tools, and materials to ensure that, upon completion, the building will consume a minimal amount of energy for heating, cooling, illumination, and ventilation during operation.\n\nHigh performance buildings deliver a wide range of benefits to owners and tenants. Because they require relatively less energy to heat, cool, and ventilate, such buildings often yield lower utility costs. Occupants often prefer living, working, and learning in high-performance buildings because they better manage:\n\n\nA 2012 study by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy found that multifamily buildings present a tremendous opportunity for energy savings. Comprehensive, cost-effective upgrades in multifamily buildings could improve efficiency by 15-30%, the Council found, representing an annual sector-wide savings of almost USD$3.4 billion.\n\nGlobally, buildings constitute a leading consumer of energy and a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. In 2010 buildings accounted for 32% of total global final energy use, 19% of energy-related GHG emissions, including emissions produced in the production of electricity that is used by buildings. In the United States in 2016, carbon emissions from homes and commercial businesses contributed 6,511 million metric tons of CO equivalent to the atmosphere, or 11 percent of the nation's total.\n\nGovernments with jurisdiction over building codes and standards and that are interested in reducing the climate impact of buildings may seek to reduce these emissions by either incentivizing requiring higher levels of energy efficiency performance in new homes and other buildings.\n"}
{"id": "3084283", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3084283", "title": "Humanitarian intervention", "text": "Humanitarian intervention\n\nHumanitarian Intervention has been defined as a state's use of \"military force (publicly stated that its use is for ending the violation of human rights) against another state.\" This definition may be too narrow as it precludes non-military forms of intervention such as humanitarian aid and international sanctions. On this broader understanding, \"Humanitarian intervention should be understood to encompass… non-forcible methods, namely intervention undertaken without military force to alleviate mass human suffering within sovereign borders.\"\nThere is not one standard or legal definition of humanitarian intervention; the field of analysis (such as law, ethics or politics) often influences the definition that is chosen. Differences in definition include variations in whether humanitarian intervention is limited to instances where there is an absence of consent from the host state; whether humanitarian intervention is limited to punishment actions; and whether humanitarian intervention is limited to cases where there has been explicit UN Security Council authorization for action. There is, however, a general consensus on some of its essential characteristics: \n\nThe customary international law concept of humanitarian intervention dates back to Hugo Grotius and the European politics in the 17th century. The subject of humanitarian intervention has remained a compelling foreign policy issue, especially since NATO's intervention in Kosovo in 1999, as it highlights the tension between the principle of state sovereignty – a defining pillar of the UN system and international law – and evolving international norms related to human rights and the use of force. Moreover, it has sparked normative and empirical debates over its legality, the ethics of using military force to respond to human rights violations, when it should occur, who should intervene, and whether it is effective.\n\nTo its proponents, it marks imperative action in the face of human rights abuses, over the rights of state sovereignty, while to its detractors it is often viewed as a pretext for military intervention often devoid of legal sanction, selectively deployed and achieving only ambiguous ends. Its frequent use following the end of the Cold War suggested to many that a new norm of military humanitarian intervention was emerging in international politics, although some now argue that the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the US \"war on terror\" have brought the era of humanitarian intervention to an end. James Pattison, however, argued in 2011 that the NATO intervention in Libya breaks this trend.\n\nGetting involved in the affairs of another state on humanitarian grounds has been a subject of discussion in public international law since the 19th century.\n\nAccording to Jonathan Friedman and Paul James, explicit assertions about humanitarian motives are not a new phenomenon and military action is instead often rationalized through such moral rather than political arguments. As a pretext for deploying troops in Italian Somaliland and Italian Eritrea for an intended invasion of Ethiopia, Benito Mussolini thus claimed that he was attempting to both secure the Wal Wal border area where some Italian soldiers had been killed and abolish the local slave trade. Similarly, Adolf Hitler justified his own forces' occupation of the Sudetenland by suggesting that they were attempting to quash ethnic tensions in Czechoslovakia.\nPossibly the first historical example of a state expressly intervening in the internal affairs of another on the grounds of humanitarian concern was during the Greek War of Independence in the early 19th century, when Britain, France and Russia decisively intervened in a naval engagement at Navarino in 1827 to secure for the Greeks independence from the Ottoman Empire.\n\nPopular opinion in England was sympathetic to the Greeks (philhellenism), in part due to the Greek origin of the West's classical heritage. The renowned poet Lord Byron even took up arms to join the Greek revolutionaries, while the London Philhellenic Committee was established to aid the Greek insurgents financially.\n\nIn 1823, after initial ambivalence, the Foreign Secretary George Canning declared that \"when a whole nation revolts against its conqueror, the nation cannot be considered as piratical but as a nation in a state of war\". In February that same year, he notified the Ottoman Empire that the United Kingdom would maintain friendly relations with the Turks only under the condition that the latter respected the Christian subjects of the Empire. He was also instrumental in the outcome of the St. Petersburg Protocol 1826, in which Russia and Britain agreed to mediate between the Ottomans and the Greeks on the basis of complete autonomy of Greece under Turkish sovereignty. When this did not end the War, Canning negotiated a following treaty that ultimately led to the destruction of the Egyptian-Turkish fleet at the Battle of Navarino.\nThe treatment of minorities under the Ottoman aegis proved a rich source of liberal agitation throughout the nineteenth century. A multinational force under French leadership was sent to Lebanon to help restore peace after the 1860 Druze–Maronite conflict, in which thousands of Christian Maronites had been massacred by the Druze population. Following an international outcry, the Ottoman Empire agreed on 3 August 1860 to the dispatch of up to 12,000 European soldiers to reestablish order. This agreement was further formalized in a convention on 5 September 1860 with Austria, Great Britain, France, Prussia and Russia.\n\nIn May 1876 Ottoman troops began massacring unarmed agitators for autonomy in Bulgaria, leading to the Eastern Crisis. The British launched a government investigation into the events, which confirmed that as part of an official policy, the Turks had killed at least 12,000 Bulgarians and obliterated about 60 villages. Lurid reports began to appear in newspapers, especially accounts by the investigative journalist William Thomas Stead in the Northern Echo, and protest meetings were called across the country.\nDespite the unprecedented demonstration of the strength of public opinion and the media, the Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli remained an unmoved practitioner of \"realpolitik\", and considered British interests to lie in the preservation of Ottoman sovereignty in Eastern Europe. Lord Derby the Foreign Secretary disagreed and telegraphed the Sublime Porte that \"any renewal of the outrages would be more fatal to the Porte than the loss of a battle.\" Apart from issuing stern advice and proposals for internal Turkish reform and the legal protection of minorities, the Disraeli government did nothing. However, the issue convulsed British politics with former Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone coming out of retirement to campaign over the atrocities. In a famous campaigning speech he said:\nLet the Turks now carry away their abuses, in the only possible manner, namely, by carrying off themselves. Their Zaptiehs and their Mudirs, their Blmhashis and Yuzbashis, their Kaimakams and their Pashas, one and all, bag and baggage, shall, I hope, clear out from the province that they have desolated and profaned. This thorough riddance, this most blessed deliverance, is the only reparation we can make to those heaps and heaps of dead, the violated purity alike of matron and of maiden and of child; to the civilization which has been affronted and shamed; to the laws of God, or, if you like, of Allah; to the moral sense of mankind at large.\n\nRising Great Power tensions in the early 20th century and the interwar period led to a breakdown in the concerted will of the international community to enforce considerations of a humanitarian nature. Attempts were made under the auspices of the League of Nations to arbitrate and settle international disputes. Aggressive actions, such as the Italian Invasion of Abyssinia and the Japanese occupation of Manchuria were condemned, but the League lacked the resolve to enforce its will effectively. The Allied discovery of the Holocaust and the subsequent Nuremberg trials at the end of World War II caused attitudes to change considerably. After the tragedies in Rwanda and the Balkans in the 1990s, the international community began to debate how to react to cases in which human rights are grossly and systematically violated. Especially, in his Millenium Report of 2000, then Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan, called on Member States: \"If humanitarian interention is indeed, an unacceptable assault on sovereignty, how hould we resond to a Rwanda, to a Srebrenica, to gross and systematic violation of human rights that offend every precept of our common humanity?\". Since the end of the Cold War, interventions have increasingly been used, such as the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia and the 2011 military intervention in Libya. \n\nOne of the first champions of the duty of humanitarian intervention to prevent atrocities around the world, was the Victorian liberal John Stuart Mill, who wrote in his 1859 essay \"A Few Words on Non-Intervention\":\n\n\"There seems to be no little need that the whole doctrine of non-interference with foreign nations should be reconsidered, if it can be said to have as yet been considered as a really moral question at all... To go to war for an idea, if the war is aggressive, not defensive, is as criminal as to go to war for territory or revenue; for it is as little justifiable to force our ideas on other people, as to compel them to submit to our will in any other respect. But there assuredly are cases in which it is allowable to go to war, without having been ourselves attacked, or threatened with attack; and it is very important that nations should make up their minds in time, as to what these cases are... To suppose that the same international customs, and the same rules of international morality, can obtain between one civilized nation and another, and between civilized nations and barbarians, is a grave error...\"\n\nAccording to Mill's opinion (in 1859) barbarous peoples were found in Algeria and India where the French and British armies had been involved. Mill's justification of intervention was overt imperialism. First, he argued that with \"barbarians\" there is no hope for \"reciprocity\", an international fundamental. Second, barbarians are apt to benefit from civilized interveners, said Mill, citing Roman conquests of Gaul, Spain, Numidia and Dacia. Barbarians,\n\n\"have no rights as a nation, except a right to such treatment as may, at the earliest possible period, fit them for becoming one. The only moral laws for the relation between a civilized and a barbarous government, are the universal rules of morality between man and man.\"\n\nWhile seeming wildly out of kilter with modern discourse, a similar approach can be found in theory on intervention in failed states. Of more widespread relevance, Mill discussed the position between \"civilized peoples\".\n\n\"The disputed question is that of interfering in the regulation of another country’s internal concerns; the question whether a nation is justified in taking part, on either side, in the civil wars or party contests of another: and chiefly, whether it may justifiably aid the people of another country in struggling for liberty; or may impose on a country any particular government or institutions, either as being best for the country itself, or as necessary for the security of its neighbours.\n\nMill brushes over the situation of intervening on the side of governments who are trying to oppress an uprising of their own, saying \"government which needs foreign support to enforce obedience from its own citizens, is one which ought not to exist\". In the case however of a civil war, where both parties seem at fault, Mill argues that third parties are entitled to demand that the conflicts shall cease. He then moves to the more contentious situation of wars for liberation.\n\n\"When the contest is only with native rulers, and with such native strength as those rulers can enlist in their defence, the answer I should give to the question of the legitimacy of intervention is, as a general rule, No. The reason is, that there can seldom be anything approaching to assurance that intervention, even if successful, would be for the good of the people themselves. The only test possessing any real value, of a people’s having become fit for popular institutions, is that they, or a sufficient portion of them to prevail in the contest, are willing to brave labour and danger for their liberation. I know all that may be said, I know it may be urged that the virtues of freemen cannot be learnt in the school of slavery, and that if a people are not fit for freedom, to have any chance of becoming so they must first be free. And this would be conclusive, if the intervention recommended would really give them freedom. But the evil is, that if they have not sufficient love of liberty to be able to wrest it from merely domestic oppressors, the liberty which is bestowed on them by other hands than their own, will have nothing real, nothing permanent. No people ever was and remained free, but because it was determined to be so...\"Mill's argument for humanitarian intervention, however, is not compatible with modern international law. International law after World War II establishes the principle of sovereign equality, and therefore to subject a sovereign state to outside intervention is generally considered illegal. To deal with this potential conflict between humanitarian intervention and the international legal system, there are some philosophical attempts to conciliate the two concepts and specify conditions for ethically justified interventions. John Rawls, one of the most influential political philosophers of the twentieth century, offers his theory of humanitarian intervention based on the notion of \"well-ordered society.\" According to Rawls, a well-ordered society should be peaceful and legitimate, and it must respect basic human rights. Between such well-ordered societies, the principle of non-intervention should uphold. On the other hand, expansionist or human rights violating regimes are not shielded from the international law: in grave cases such as ethnic cleansing, coercive intervention by others is legitimate.\n\nMartha Nussbaum, however, is critical of Rawls' approach. She points out that the sufferings of individuals, not those of the impersonal states, form the moral foundations of humanitarian intervention. Therefore, the concept of \"well-ordered society,\" by falsely focusing on the state rather than individuals, cannot determine whether an intervention is justified. Instead, Nussbaum proposes a more concrete standard based on human capabilities (see Capability approach). She argues that \"[n]ational sovereignty should be respected, within the constraints of promoting human capabilities\". In other words, if a state fails to provide its citizens the basic \"capabilities,\" such as the capability to live a healthy life, then outside intervention is justified.\n\nSome critics contend that modern philosophical arguments for humanitarian aid fail to recognize the flaws of current international law itself. International Relations scholar Martha Finnemore argues that humanitarian crises often involve conflict between the most basic principles of international law: sovereignty, human rights and self-determination. As a result, philosophical attempts to integrate all those principles into a clear ethical guideline of humanitarian intervention is deemed to be futile. Legal scholar Eric Posner also points out that countries tend to hold different views of human rights and public good, so to establish a relatively simple set of rules that reflects shared ethics is not likely to succeed.\n\nHumanitarian intervention is a concept that can allow the use of force in a situation when the UN Security Council cannot pass a resolution under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations due to veto by a permanent member. Chapter VII allows the Security Council to take action in situations where there is a \"threat to the peace, breach of the peace or act of aggression\". However, any resolution to that effect must be supported by all five permanent members. The reference to the \"right\" of humanitarian intervention was, in the post Cold-War context for the first time invoked in 1990 by the UK delegation after Russia and China had failed to support a no-fly zone over Iraq. Therefore, in addition to humanitarian objectives the concept is designed to circumvent the UN Security Council by invoking a right. However, critics base their arguments on the 1648 treaty of Westphalia, which states the rights of sovereign nations to act freely within their own borders. This is upheld in the UN Charter of 1945, where in article 2(7) it is stated that \"nothing should authorize intervention in matters essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state.\" Thus, because both proponents and opponents of humanitarian intervention have their legal grounds on the charter of the United Nations, there is still an ongoing controversy as to whether sovereignty or humanitarian causes should prevail. The United Nations has also continuously been involved with issues related to humanitarian intervention, with the UN intervening in an increased number of conflicts within the borders of nations.\n\nAlthough most writers agree that humanitarian interventions should be undertaken multilaterally, ambiguity remains over which particular agents the UN, regional organizations, or a group of states should act in response to mass violations of human rights. The choice of actor has implications for overcoming collective action challenges through mobilization of political will and material resources. Questions of effectiveness, conduct and motives of the intervener, extent of internal and external support, and legal authorization have also been raised as possible criteria for evaluating the legitimacy of a potential intervener.\n\nThe most well-known standard for humanitarian intervention after World War II has been genocide. According to, the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide, the term was defined as acts “committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national ethnic, racial, or religious group.” However, the norm has been challenged. Because there is a high possibility that if the international community applies the genocide standard to undertake humanitarian intervention, it would have been too late to make a meaningful intervention which should have prevented mass homicide in the concerned country.\n\nThese two well-known standards for humanitarian intervention do not resolve the states’ trade-offs between moral responsibilities and potential costs. Furthermore, intervention without a viable plan and workable strategy could threaten the states’ obligation to their own people. It should also be considered, that sometimes humanitarian intervention only results in open-ended chaos in the country without meaningful progress.\n\nThe understanding of what constitutes threats to international peace has been radically broadened since the 1990s to include such issues as mass displacement, and the UN Security Council has authorized use of force in situations that many states would have previously viewed as \"internal\" conflicts.\n\nIn several instances states or groups of states have intervened with force, and without advanced authorization from the UN Security Council, at least in part in response to alleged extreme violations of basic human rights. Fairly recent examples include the intervention after the Gulf War to protect the Kurds in northern Iraq as well as NATO's intervention in Kosovo.\n\nFour distinct attitudes or approaches to the legitimacy of humanitarian intervention in the absence of Security Council authorizations can be identified:\n\nAlthough usually considered to be categorically distinct from most definitions of humanitarian intervention, the emergence of a 'Responsibility to protect' (R2P) deserves mention. Responsibility to Protect is the name of a report produced in 2001 by the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty (ICISS) which was established by the Canadian government in response to Kofi Annan's question of when the international community must intervene for humanitarian purposes. The Canadian government's report, \"The Responsibility to Protect,\" found that the sovereignty not only gave a State the right to \"control\" its affairs, it also conferred on the State primary \"responsibility\" for protecting the people within its borders. Also, the report proposed that when a State fails to protect its people - either through lack of ability or a lack of willingness - the responsibility shifts to the broader international community. The report sought to establish a set of clear guidelines for determining when intervention is appropriate, what the appropriate channels for approving an intervention are and how the intervention itself should be carried out.\n\nResponsibility to protect seeks to establish a clearer code of conduct for humanitarian interventions and also advocates a greater reliance on non-military measures. The report also criticises and attempts to change the discourse and terminology surrounding the issue of humanitarian intervention. It argues that the notion of a 'right to intervene' is problematic and should be replaced with the 'responsibility to protect'. Under Responsibility to Protect doctrine, rather than having a right to intervene in the conduct of other states, states are said to have a responsibility to intervene and protect the citizens of another state where that other state has failed in its obligation to protect its own citizens.\n\nThis responsibility is said to involve three stages: to prevent, to react and to rebuild. Responsibility to Protect has gained strong support in some circles, such as in Canada, a handful of European and African nations, and among proponents of human security, but has been criticised by others, with some Asian nations being among the chief dissenters.\n\nSee:\n\nPotential examples of previous humanitarian interventions include:\n\nSome academics have referred to these cases as humanitarian interventions. However, in some cases this is only a retrospective classification of actions that were the result of a variety of motivations. Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia for instance, was justified as self-defense rather than humanitarianism and has only later come to be seen as a possible example of humanitarian intervention.\n\nIn “Can Intervention Work?” Rory Stewart, a British diplomat and politician, and Gerald Knaus, a professor and author, argue that in certain circumstances limited, but resourced interventions for a humanitarian mission can succeed. The authors co-wrote an introduction at a moment when the international communality was debating whether and how to intervene in Libya, and highlight the West’s history of imperfect interventions. They quote Anthony Lake’s policy, “to help other nation’s build themselves” as a guiding principal in foreign intervention. The authors are critical of the RAND Corporation report \"Beginner’s Guide to Nation-Building\" and argue every intervention situation is different based on the local political economy and there is not one universal approach that always works. The rest of the book is divided into two sections: first, Stewart reviews the international experience in Afghanistan since 9/11 based on his experience and travel in the country, and second, Knaus provides a case study on the international intervention in Bosnia. Overall, the authors warn against “over-interventions” such as Iraq that were based on “exaggerated fears\" and “irrational confidence” and often ignored “local tradition, identity, and history.” Stewart and Knaus advocate an intervention policy based on ““principled incrementalism” that invest time and resources in understanding local context and defining concrete goals.\n\nMany criticisms have been levied against humanitarian intervention. Inter-governmental bodies and commission reports composed by persons associated with governmental and international careers have rarely discussed the distorting selectivity of geopolitics behind humanitarian intervention nor potential hidden motivations of intervening parties. To find less veiled criticism one must usually turn to civil society perspectives, especially those shaped by independent scholars who benefit from academic freedom.\n\nSome argue that humanitarian intervention is a modern manifestation of the Western colonialism of the 19th century; the subjects of such intervention are ruled not by one sole party or entity, but by a mix of local institutions, NGOs and the interveners themselves. Anne Orford's work is a major contribution along these lines, demonstrating the extent to which the perils of the present for societies experiencing humanitarian catastrophes are directly attributable to the legacy of colonial rule. In the name of reconstruction, a capitalist set of constraints is imposed on a broken society that impairs its right of self-determination and prevents its leadership from adopting an approach to development that benefits the people of the country rather than makes foreign investors happy. The essence of her position is that \"legal narratives\" justifying humanitarian intervention have had the primary effect of sustaining \"an unjust and exploitative status quo\".\n\nOthers argue that dominant countries, especially the United States and its coalition partners, are using humanitarian pretexts to pursue otherwise unacceptable geopolitical goals and to evade the non-intervention norm and legal prohibitions on the use of international force. Noam Chomsky and Tariq Ali are at the forefront of this camp, viewing professions of humanitarian motivation with deep skepticism. They argue that the United States has continued to act with its own interests in mind, with the only change being that humanitarianism has become a legitimizing ideology for projection of U.S. hegemony in a post–Cold War world. Ali in particular argues that NATO intervention in Kosovo was conducted largely to boost NATO's credibility. Chomsky’s expression of “our excess of righteousness and disinterested benevolence” is often used to describe Kennedy’s invasion of South Vietnam, which spread to all of Indochina. Furthermore, he asserts that the prospective leader of “humanitarian intervention” must uphold several qualifications. A first qualification is that the leader has to work as a moral agent that does not magnify the danger of elite culture, the efficacy of the intervention should be on the targeted population, and the people must be the moral agents that undertake humanitarian efforts.\n\nA third type of criticism centers on the event-based and inconsistent nature of most policies on humanitarian intervention. These critics argue that there is a tendency for the concept to be invoked in the heat of action, giving the appearance of propriety for Western television viewers, but that it neglects the conflicts that are forgotten by the media or occur based on chronic distresses rather than sudden crises. Henry Kissinger, for example, finds that Bill Clinton's practice of humanitarian intervention was wildly inconsistent. The US launched two military campaigns against Serbia while ignoring more widespread slaughter in Rwanda, justifying the Russian assault on Chechnya, and welcoming to the United States the second-ranking military official of a widely recognized severe human rights violator - the communist government of North Korea.\n\nFurther, sceptics have also argued that Humanitarian Intervention may have perverse consequences. Castan Pinos claims that “humanitarian” interventions generate a multiplicity of collateral effects, including civilian deaths, conflict-aggravation, violence spill-over into neighbouring regions and mutual distrust between great powers. \n\nJeremy Weinstein, a political scientist at Stanford University, has argued for \"autonomous recovery\": although the number of civilian deaths rises when violence between rebel groups is left unchecked, the eventual victors can develop institutions and set the terms of their rule in a self-enforcing manner. Such self-enforcement reduces the risk of a country slipping back into violence.\n\nAnother criticism argues that humanitarian intervention has historically consisted of primarily actions directed by so-called Northern states within the internal affairs of so-called Southern states, and has also led to criticism from many non-Western states. These critics argue that the norm of non-intervention and the primacy of sovereign equality is something still cherished by the vast majority of states, which see humanitarian intervention not as a growing awareness of human rights, but a regression to the selective adherence to sovereignty of the pre–UN Charter world. During the Havana G-77 summit in 2000, the \"so-called right of humanitarian intervention\" as it was described, was condemned as having no basis in international law. Furthermore, in his criticism, Chomsky writes that \"Humanitarian interventionism goes only one way - from the powerful to the weak\", and condemns what he called the targeting of the concept of national sovereignty by humanitarian interventionists, arguing that the primary purpose of national sovereignty is to give weak states partial protection against strong states, and that the protection of national sovereignty under international law stops internal conflicts in weak countries being exploited by strong ones.\n\n\n\nThis article relies heavily on the , which was accessed for translation on August 27, 2005.\n"}

{"id": "105931", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=105931", "title": "Lady Godiva", "text": "Lady Godiva\n\nGodiva, Countess of Mercia (; died between 1066 and 1086), in Old English Godgifu, was an English noblewoman who, according to a legend dating at least to the 13th century, rode naked – covered only in her long hair – through the streets of Coventry to gain a remission of the oppressive taxation that her husband imposed on his tenants. The name \"Peeping Tom\" for a voyeur originates from later versions of this legend in which a man named Thomas watched her ride and was struck blind or dead.\n\nGodiva was the wife of Leofric, Earl of Mercia. They had one known son, Aelfgar.\n\nGodiva's name occurs in charters and the Domesday survey, though the spelling varies. The Old English name Godgifu or Godgyfu meant \"gift of God\"; Godiva was the Latinised form. Since the name was a popular one, there are contemporaries of the same name.\n\nIf she is the same Godiva who appears in the history of Ely Abbey, the \"Liber Eliensis\", written at the end of the 12th century, then she was a widow when Leofric married her. Both Leofric and Godiva were generous benefactors to religious houses. In 1043 Leofric founded and endowed a Benedictine monastery at Coventry on the site of a nunnery destroyed by the Danes in 1016. Writing in the 12th century, Roger of Wendover credits Godiva as the persuasive force behind this act. In the 1050s, her name is coupled with that of her husband on a grant of land to the monastery of St. Mary, Worcester and the endowment of the minster at Stow St Mary, Lincolnshire. She and her husband are commemorated as benefactors of other monasteries at Leominster, Chester, Much Wenlock, and Evesham. She gave Coventry a number of works in precious metal by the famous goldsmith Mannig and bequeathed a necklace valued at 100 marks of silver. Another necklace went to Evesham, to be hung around the figure of the Virgin accompanying the life-size gold and silver rood she and her husband gave, and St Paul's Cathedral in the City of London received a gold-fringed chasuble. She and her husband were among the most munificent of the several large Anglo-Saxon donors of the last decades before the Norman Conquest; the early Norman bishops made short work of their gifts, carrying them off to Normandy or melting them down for bullion.\n\nThe manor of Woolhope in Herefordshire, along with four others, was given to the cathedral at Hereford before the Norman Conquest by the benefactresses Wulviva and Godivausually held to be this Godiva and her sister. The church there has a 20th-century stained glass window representing them.\n\nHer signature, \"Ego Godiva Comitissa diu istud desideravi\" [I, The Countess Godiva, have desired this for a long time], appears on a charter purportedly given by Thorold of Bucknall to the Benedictine monastery of Spalding. However, this charter is considered spurious by many historians. Even so, it is possible that Thorold, who appears in the Domesday Book as sheriff of Lincolnshire, was her brother. (See Lucy of Bolingbroke.)\n\nAfter Leofric's death in 1057, his widow lived on until sometime between the Norman Conquest of 1066 and 1086. She is mentioned in the Domesday survey as one of the few Anglo-Saxons and the only woman to remain a major landholder shortly after the conquest. By the time of this great survey in 1086, Godiva had died, but her former lands are listed, although now held by others. Thus, Godiva apparently died between 1066 and 1086.\n\nThe place where Godiva was buried has been a matter of debate. According to the \"Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham\", or \"Evesham Chronicle\", she was buried at the Church of the Blessed Trinity at Evesham, which is no longer standing. According to the account in the \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\", \"There is no reason to doubt that she was buried with her husband at Coventry, despite the assertion of the Evesham chronicle that she lay in Holy Trinity, Evesham.\"\n\nWilliam Dugdale (1656) says that a window with representations of Leofric and Godiva was placed in Trinity Church, Coventry, about the time of Richard II.\n\nThe legend of the nude ride is first recorded in the 13th century, in the \"Flores Historiarum\" and the adaptation of it by Roger of Wendover. Despite its considerable age, it is not regarded as plausible by modern historians, nor is it mentioned in the two centuries intervening between Godiva's death and its first appearance, while her generous donations to the church receive various mentions.\n\nAccording to the typical version of the story, Lady Godiva took pity on the people of Coventry, who were suffering grievously under her husband's oppressive taxation. Lady Godiva appealed again and again to her husband, who obstinately refused to remit the tolls. At last, weary of her entreaties, he said he would grant her request if she would strip naked and ride on a horse through the streets of the town. Lady Godiva took him at his word, and after issuing a proclamation that all persons should stay indoors and shut their windows, she rode through the town, clothed only in her long hair. Just one person in the town, a tailor ever afterwards known as \"Peeping Tom\", disobeyed her proclamation in one of the most famous instances of voyeurism.\n\nSome historians have discerned elements of pagan fertility rituals in the Godiva story, whereby a young \"May Queen\" was led to the sacred Cofa's tree, perhaps to celebrate the renewal of spring. The oldest form of the legend has Godiva passing through Coventry market from one end to the other while the people were assembled, attended only by two knights. This version is given in \"Flores Historiarum\" by Roger of Wendover (died 1236), a somewhat gullible collector of anecdotes, who quoted from unnamed earlier writers.\nOther attempts to find a more plausible rationale for the legend include one based on the custom at the time for penitents to make a public procession in their shift, a sleeveless white garment similar to a slip today and one which was certainly considered \"underwear\". Thus Godiva might have actually travelled through town as a penitent, in her shift. Godiva's story could have passed into folk history to be recorded in a romanticised version. Another theory has it that Lady Godiva's \"nakedness\" might refer to her riding through the streets stripped of her jewellery, the trademark of her upper class rank. However, these attempts to reconcile known facts with legend are both weak; in the era of the earliest accounts, the word \"naked\" is only known to mean \"without any clothing whatsoever\".\n\nA modified version of the story was given by printer Richard Grafton, later elected MP for Coventry. According to his \"Chronicle of England\" (1569), \"Leofricus\" had already exempted the people of Coventry from \"any maner of Tolle, Except onely of Horses\", so that Godiva (\"Godina\" in text) had agreed to the naked ride just to win relief for this horse tax. And as a condition, she required the officials of Coventry to forbid the populace \"upon a great pain\" from watching her, and to shut themselves in and shutter all windows on the day of her ride. Grafton was an ardent Protestant and sanitized the earlier story.\n\nThe ballad \"Leoffricus\" in the Percy Folio (ca. 1650) conforms to Grafton's version, saying that Lady Godiva performed her ride to remove the customs paid on horses, and that the town's officers ordered the townsfolk to \"shutt their dore, & clap their windowes downe,\" and remain indoors on the day of her ride.\n\nThe story of Peeping Tom, who alone among the townsfolk spied on the Lady Godiva's naked ride, probably did not originate in literature, but came about through popular lore in the locality of Coventry. Reference by 17th-century chroniclers has been claimed, but all the published accounts are 18th-century or later.\n\nAccording to an 1826 article submitted by someone well-versed in local history and identifying himself as W. Reader, there was already a well-established tradition that there was a certain tailor who had spied on Lady Godiva, and that at the annual Trinity Great Fair (now called the Godiva Festival) featuring the Godiva processions \"a grotesque figure called Peeping Tom\" would be set on display, and it was a wooden statue carved from oak. The author has dated this effigy, based on the style of armour he is shown wearing, from the reign of Charles II (d. 1685). The same writer felt the legend had to be subsequent to William Dugdale (d. 1686) since he made no mention of it in his works that discussed Coventry at full length. (The story of the tailor and the use of a wooden effigy may be as old as the 17th century, but the effigy may not have always been called \"Tom\". See 1773 date below, and the alternate suggested name \"Action\".)\n\nW. Reader dates the first Godiva procession to 1677, but other sources date the first parade to 1678, and on that year a lad from the household of James Swinnerton enacted the role of Lady Godiva.\n\nThe English \"Dictionary of National Biography\" (\"D.N.B.\") gives a meticulous account of the literary sources. The historian Paul de Rapin (1732) reported the Coventry lore that Lady Godiva performed her ride while \"commanding all Persons to keep within Doors and from their Windows, on pain of Death\" but one man could not refrain from looking and it \"cost him his life\"; Rapin further reported that the town commemorates this with a \"Statue of a Man looking out of a Window.\"\n\nNext, Thomas Pennant in \"Journey from Chester to London\" (1782) recounted how \"the curiosity of a certain taylor overcoming his fear, he took a single peep\". Pennant noted that the person enacting Godiva in the procession was not fully naked of course, but wore \"silk, closely fitted to her limbs\", which had a colour resembling the skin's complexion. (In Chester's time around 1782 silk was worn, but the annotator of the 1811 edition noted that a cotton garment had since replaced the silk fabric.) According to the \"D.N.B.\", the oldest document that mentions \"Peeping Tom\" by name is a record in Coventry's official annals, dating to 11 June 1773, documenting that the city issued a new wig and paint for the wooden effigy.\n\nThere is also said to be a letter from pre-1700, stating that the peeper was actually Action (pronounced Actæon?), Lady Godiva's groom.\n\nAdditional legend proclaims that Peeping Tom was later struck blind as heavenly punishment, or that the townspeople took the matter in their own hands and blinded him.\n\nThe Herbert Art Gallery and Museum in Coventry maintains a permanent exhibition on the subject. The oldest painting was commissioned by the County of the City of Coventry in 1586 and produced by Adam van Noort, a refugee Flemish artist. His painting depicts a \"voluptuously displayed\" Lady Godiva against the background of a \"fantastical Italianate Coventry\". In addition the Gallery has collected many Victorian interpretations of the subject described by Marina Warner as \"an oddly composed Landseer, a swooning Watts and a sumptuous Alfred Woolmer\".\n\nJohn Collier's \"Lady Godiva\" was bequeathed by social reformer Thomas Hancock Nunn. When he died in 1937, the Pre-Raphaelite-style painting was offered to the Corporation of Hampstead. He specified in his will that should his bequest be refused by Hampstead (presumably on grounds of propriety) the painting was then to be offered to Coventry. The painting now hangs in the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum.\n\nAmerican sculptor Anne Whitney created a marble sculpture of Lady Godiva, now in the collection of the Dallas Museum of Art, Dallas, Texas.\n\nGodiva Chocolatier is named after Lady Godiva, and features a stylised rendition of her ride as its logo.\n\nPaul Jones recorded the song \"Lady Godiva\" for his 1966 album \"My Way\". The duo Peter and Gordon recorded a cover version the same year, which became a Top 10 single in the US.\n\nThe New York-based rock group The Velvet Underground recorded the song \"Lady Godiva's Operation\" for their 1968 album \"White Light/White Heat\".\n\nDr. Hook & The Medicine Show recorded a song, \"Hey, Lady Godiva!\" written by Shel Silverstein. The song addressed Godiva directly and contained the chorus, \"Don't know much about horses, but you sure picked a funny way to ride 'em.\"\n\nExtreme metal band Heaven Shall Burn used the legend of Lady Godiva for the song \"Godiva\" from their 2013 album \"Veto\".\n\nThe band Queen references Godiva in their song \"Don't Stop Me Now\" with the lyric, “I’m a racing car, passing by like Lady Godiva.”\n\nBattle Rapper Bonnie Godiva created her stage name from a combination of the names of Lady Godiva and Bonnie Elizabeth Parker.\n\nIn the second episode of season 7 of the television show Charmed, titled \"The Bare Witch Project\", the main characters meet Lady Godiva and protect her from an evil baron.\n\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1838, it is a member of the \"Magic Circle\" of elite British law firms. It currently employs over 2,000 lawyers across 29 offices in 20 countries.\n\nIn 2016, Linklaters achieved revenues of £1.31 billion ($1.97 billion) and profits per equity partner of £1.45 million ($2.2 million). In the UK, the firm has top-tier rankings across many practice areas, including corporate/M&A, capital markets, litigation, banking and finance, restructuring and insolvency, antitrust and tax. In 2017, Linklaters was ranked third, tied with Eversheds Sutherland, for FTSE 100 clients. For direct deals by institutional investors in the first half of 2016, Linklaters tied for first place. In the 2012 Global Elite Brand Index, Linklaters was named the third-strongest global law firm brand.\n\nLinklaters was founded in London in 1838 when John Linklater entered into a partnership with Julius Dods. The firm, initially known as Dods & Linklater, developed a practice in corporate law, including advising on the creation of the Metropolitan Water Board. On 4 May 1920, the firm, then known as Linklater & Co, merged with another renowned London firm, Paines Plythe & Huxtable, which had been founded by a descendant of Thomas Paine.\n\nFor most of the twentieth century, Linklaters & Paines was predominately a domestic corporate law firm, with only a small number of overseas offices. However, in 1998, Linklaters & Alliance was created in partnership with many of Europe's leading law firms, including De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek in Amsterdam, De Bandt van Hecke Lagae in Brussels, Loesch & Wolter in Luxembourg, Lagerlöf & Leman in Stockholm and Oppenhoff & Rädler in Germany. Over the next five years, Linklaters & Paines merged with the last four of these Alliance firms, as well as several other European firms, in Belgium, Luxembourg, Sweden, Germany, Czech Republic and Poland. The firm opened new offices in Amsterdam, Bangkok, Beijing, Budapest, Bucharest, Bratislava, Lisbon, Madrid, Milan, Rome, São Paulo, and Shanghai. In 1999, amid this global expansion, the firm shortened its name to Linklaters.\n\nOn 1 April 2005, after Japan enacted laws to allow certain international law firms to open offices in the country, Linklaters created Japan’s first fully merged law firm practising Japanese, English and US law. Linklaters spun off its offices in Bratislava, Bucharest, Budapest and Prague into a separate firm, Kinstellar (an anagram of Linklaters) in 2007. In the aftermath of the credit crunch in 2008, Linklaters cut 270 jobs in London, consisting of around 120 lawyers and 150 other staff. This was reported to be part of managing partner Simon Davies' plan to become a smaller, more profitable organisation.\n\nOn 1 May 2012, Linklaters entered into an alliance with top-tier Australian law firm Allens. Allens and Linklaters operate two joint ventures in Asia: one focused on energy, resources and infrastructure services, and another on Indonesia in collaboration with domestic firm Widyawan & Partners. On 1 February 2013, the firm entered into an alliance with leading South African law firm Webber Wentzel. The company is very active in China. Linklaters also has a best-friend arrangement with Talwar Thakore & Associates, a leading Indian law firm.\n\nLinklaters' Paris practice, which consists of 30 partners, in November 2017 lost several partners including partner David Swinburne to the firm Jones Day. Earlier that year, the Paris office also lost Kiril Bougartchev and Emmanuel Moyne, who spun off to form their own firm. The firm then hired Tom Alabaster from Latham & Watkins in October 2017. Then it hired a team from Mayer Brown in October 2017.\n\nLinklaters was founded and remains headquartered in London. As of 2017, the firm has 30 offices across 20 countries throughout Asia, the Middle East, North America, South America and Europe.\n\n"}

{"id": "3550910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3550910", "title": "Marine Mammal Protection Act", "text": "Marine Mammal Protection Act\n\nThe Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) was the first act of the United States Congress to call specifically for an ecosystem approach to wildlife management. It was signed into law on October 21, 1972 by President Richard Nixon and took effect 60 days later on December 21, 1972. MMPA prohibits the \"taking\" of marine mammals, and enacts a moratorium on the import, export, and sale of any marine mammal, along with any marine mammal part or product within the United States. The Act defines \"take\" as \"the act of hunting, killing, capture, and/or harassment of any marine mammal; or, the attempt at such.\" The MMPA defines harassment as \"any act of pursuit, torment or annoyance which has the potential to either: a. injure a marine mammal in the wild, or b. disturb a marine mammal by causing disruption of behavioral patterns, which includes, but is not limited to, migration, breathing, nursing, breeding, feeding, or sheltering.\" The MMPA provides for enforcement of its prohibitions, and for the issuance of regulations to implement its legislative goals.\n\nAuthority to manage the MMPA was divided between the Secretary of the Interior through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), and the Secretary of Commerce, which is delegated to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Subsequently, a third Federal agency, the Marine Mammal Commission (MMC), was established to review existing policies and make recommendations to the Service and the NOAA better implement the MMPA. Coordination between these three Federal agencies is necessary in order to provide the best management practices for marine mammals.\n\nUnder the MMPA, the Service is responsible for ensuring the protection of sea otters and marine otters, walruses, polar bears, three species of manatees, and dugongs. NOAA was given responsibility to conserve and manage pinnipeds including seals and sea lions and cetaceans such as whales and dolphins.\n\nThe MMPA prohibits the take and exploitation of any marine mammal without appropriate authorization, which may only be given by the Service. Permits may be issued for scientific research, public display, and the importation/exportation of marine mammal parts and products upon determination by the Service that the issuance is consistent with the MMPA’s regulations. The two types of permits issued by the National Marine Fisheries Service's Office of Protected Resources are incidental and directed. Incidental permits, which allow for some unintentional taking of small numbers of marine mammal, are granted to U.S. citizens who engage in a specified activity other than commercial fishing in a specified geographic area. Directed permits are required for any proposed marine mammal scientific research activity that involves taking marine mammals.\n\nApplications for such permits are reviewed and issued the Service's Division of Management Authority, through the International Affairs office. This office also houses the Division of International Conservation, which is directly responsible for coordinating international activities for marine mammal species found in both U.S. and International waters, or are absent from U.S. waters. Marine mammal species inhabiting both U.S. and International waters include the West Indian manatee, sea otter, polar bear, and Pacific walrus. Species not present in U.S. waters include the West African and Amazonian manatee, dugong, Atlantic walrus, and marine otter.\n\nIn efforts to conserve and manage marine mammal species, the Service has appointed field staff dedicated to working with partners to conduct population censuses, assess population health, develop and implement conservation plans, promulgate regulations, and create cooperative relationships internationally.\n\nVarious Marine Mammal Management offices are located on either coast. The Service's Marine Mammal Management office in Anchorage, Alaska is responsible for the management and conservation of polar bears, Pacific walruses, and northern sea otters in Alaska. Northern sea otters present in Washington State are managed by the Western Washington Field Office, while southern sea otters residing in California are managed by the Ventura Field Office. West Indian manatee populations extend from Texas to Rhode Island, and are also present in the Caribbean Sea; however, this species is most prevalent near Florida (the Florida subspecies) and Puerto Rico (the Antillean subspecies). The Service’s Jacksonville Field Office manages the Florida manatee, while the Boqueron Field Office manages the Antillean manatee.\n\nThe polar bear, southern sea otter, marine otter, all three species of manatees, and the dugong are also concurrently listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).\n\nAmendments enacted in 1981 established conditions for permits to be granted to take marine mammals \"incidentally\" in the course of commercial fishing. In addition, the amendments provided additional conditions and procedures for transferring management authority to the States, and authorized appropriations through FY 1984.\n\nPolicies created in 1982\n\nThe 1984 amendments established conditions to be satisfied as a basis for importing fish and fish products from nations engaged in harvesting yellowfin tuna with purse seines and other commercial fishing technology, as well as authorized appropriations for agency activities through FY 1988.\n\nAmended in 1988\n\n\nAmended in 1995\n\n\nCongress found that: all species and population stocks of marine mammals are, or may be, in danger of extinction or depletion due to human activities; these mammals should not be permitted to diminish below their optimum sustainable population; measures should be taken immediately to replenish any of these mammals that have diminished below that level, and efforts should be made to protect essential habitats; there is inadequate knowledge of the ecology and population dynamics of these mammals; negotiations should be undertaken immediately to encourage international arrangements for research and conservation of these mammals. Congress declared that marine mammals are resources of great international significance (aesthetic, recreational and economic), and should be protected and encouraged to develop to the greatest extent feasible commensurate with sound policies of resource management. The primary management objective should be to maintain the health and stability of the marine ecosystem. The goal is to obtain an optimum sustainable population within the carrying capacity of the habitat.\n\n\n\n"}

It was largely the brainchild of Hugh Trenchard, who served as Metropolitan Police Commissioner from 1931 to 1935. He instigated changes for the improvement of police residences known as section houses, following various reports instigated during 1932. The report proposed sweeping changes and indirectly called into question the reliability of the police in a major emergency. After adverse reactions in the press and questions in Parliament, the Home Secretary Sir John Gilmour stated that Trenchard's report would be published as a White Paper, giving MPs an opportunity to debate the issues. In very quick order the White Paper was turned into a Government Bill. The first two clauses of the Bill, which proposed to increase the number of assistant commissioners from four to five and lower the age of retirement for senior officers, did not prove too controversial. However, the clauses which set out limitations on membership of the Police Federation were hotly debated and characterized by left-wing politicians as \"fascist\". Additionally, the proposed introduction of ten-year employment terms for some new constables was met with considerable opposition. The bill was enacted in 1933 as the Metropolitan Police Act.\n\n"}
{"id": "2832610", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2832610", "title": "Municipal wireless network", "text": "Municipal wireless network\n\nMunicipal wireless network (Municipal Wi-Fi, Muni Wi-Fi or Muni-Fi) is a citywide wireless network. This is usually done by providing municipal broadband via Wi-Fi to large parts or all of a municipal area by deploying a wireless mesh network. The typical deployment design uses hundreds of wireless access points deployed outdoors, often on poles. The operator of the network acts as a wireless internet service provider.\n\nMunicipal wireless networks go far beyond the existing piggybacking opportunities available near public libraries and some coffee shops. The basic premise of carpeting an area with wireless service in urban centers is that it is more economical to the community to provide the service as a utility rather than to have individual households and businesses pay private firms for such a service. Such networks are capable of enhancing city management and public safety, especially when used directly by city employees in the field. They can also be a social service to those who cannot afford private high-speed services. When the network service is free and a small number of clients consume a majority of the available capacity, operating and regulating the network might prove difficult.\n\nIn 2003, Verge Wireless formed an agreement with Tropos Networks to build a municipal wireless networks in the downtown area of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Carlo MacDonald, the founder of Verge Wireless, suggested that it could provide cities a way to improve economic development and developers to build mobile applications that can make use of faster bandwidth. Verge Wireless built networks for Baton Rouge, New Orleans, and other areas. Some applications include wireless security cameras, police mug shot software, and location-based advertising.\n\nIn 2006 the US Federal Trade Commission expressed concerns about such private-public partnerships as trending towards a franchise monopoly.\n\nIn 2007, some companies with existing cell sites offered high-speed wireless services where the laptop owner purchased a PC card or adapter based on EV-DO cellular data receivers or WiMAX rather than 802.11b/g. A few high-end laptops at that time featured built-in support for these newer protocols. WiMAX is designed to implement a metropolitan area network (MAN) while 802.11 is designed to implement a wireless local area network (LAN).\n\nWithin the United States, providing a municipal wireless network is not recognized as a priority. Some have argued that the benefits of public approach may exceed the costs, similar to cable television.\n\nThe construction of such networks is a significant part of their lifetime costs. Usually, a private firm works with local government to construct a network and operate it. Financing is usually shared by both the private firm and the municipal government. Once operational, the service may be free to users via public finance or advertising, or may be a paid service. Among deployed networks, usage as measured by number of distinct users has been shown to be moderate to light. Private firms serving multiple cities sometimes maintain an account for each user, and allow the user a limited amount of mobile service in the cities covered. As of 2007 some Muni WiFi deployments are delayed as the private and public partners negotiate the business model and financing.\n\nIn such networks, radio communication is used both for the Wi-Fi service and for the \"backhaul\" or pathway to the Internet. This means that the nodes only need a wire for power (hence the habit of installing them on power and light utility poles). This \"all radio\" approach means that nodes must be within range of each other and form a contiguous pathway back to special aggregation nodes that have more traditional access to the Internet. Nodes then relay traffic, somewhat like a bucket brigade, from the laptop to the aggregation node. This limits the way in which the network can be grown incrementally: coverage starts near the aggregation point and, as the mesh grows, new coverage can only grow out from the edge of the mesh. If a new, isolated area is to be covered, then a new aggregation point must be constructed. Private firms often take a phased approach, starting with one or a few sectors of a city to demonstrate competence before making the larger investment of attempting full coverage of a city.\n\nGoogle WiFi is entirely funded by Google. Despite a failed attempt to provide citywide WiFi through a partnership with internet service provider Earthlink in 2007, the company claims that they are working to provide a wireless network for the city of San Francisco, California, although there is no specified completion date. Some other projects that are still in the planning stages have pared back their planned coverage from 100% of a municipal area to only densely commercially zoned areas. One of the most ambitious planned projects is to provide wireless service throughout Silicon Valley, but the winner of the bid seems ready to request that the 40 cities involved help cover more of the cost, which has raised concerns that the project will ultimately be too slow to market to be a success. Advances in technology in 2005–2007 may allow wireless community network projects to offer a viable alternative. Such projects have an advantage in that, as they do not have to negotiate with government entities, they have no contractual obligations for coverage. A promising example is Meraki's demonstration in San Francisco, which already claims 20,000 distinct users as of October 2007.\n\nIn 2009, Microsoft and Yahoo also provided free wireless to select regions in the United States. Yahoo's free WiFi was made available for one year to the Times Square area in New York City beginning November 10, 2009. Microsoft made free WiFi available to select airports and hotels across the United States, in exchange for one search on the Bing search engine by the user.\n\nUnintended externalities are possible as a result of local governments providing Internet service to their constituents. A private service provider could choose to offer limited or no service to a region if that region's largest city opted to provide free Internet service, thus eliminating the potential customer base. The private sector receives no money from taxpayers, so there isn't competition. The lack of competition prevents other municipalities in that region from benefiting from the services of the private provider. The smaller public municipalities would at the same time not benefit from the free service provided by the larger city because it is designed to be subsidized by taxpayers and not concerned about the maximization of profits. The broadband provided by the government isn't largely supported to create an income on top of the private sector not being competed with enough to make a profit. Thus, making both municipal wireless networks anticompetitive.\n\nOveruse could be another issue. If usage of the publicly provided network became heavier than existing private options network overload issues could arise, forcing the municipality to invest more heavily, thus spending more revenue, on infrastructure to maintain the existing level of service. This issue could be compounded if private providers begin exiting a market as mentioned above.\n\nIn many cases several points or areas are covered, without blanket area coverage.\n\n\n\nFree public WiFi in tourist areas of big cities, railway stations, airports, and governmental facilities in Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Harbin, Shenyang, Shenzhen, Kunming, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Wuxi, Nanjing, Xi'an, Chengdu, Chongqing, Fuzhou, Ningbo, Foshan, Dalian, Changchun, Qingdao, Yantai, Dongguan, Macau, Huangshan, Hefei, Guiyang, and Guangzhou\n\nNearly all cities have free WiFi coverage, hosted either by their local service carrier, or city government, all railway stations in China have free WiFi, along with all Airports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://propakistani.pk/2014/09/22/telenor-launches-wifi-hotspots-in-karachi/\nhttps://wifispc.com/pakistan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, a few U.S. states, such as Illinois, Iowa, and Massachusetts, offer free Wi-Fi service at welcome centers and roadside rest areas located along major Interstate highways.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "439598", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=439598", "title": "Natural justice", "text": "Natural justice\n\nIn English law, natural justice is technical terminology for the rule against bias (\"nemo iudex in causa sua\") and the right to a fair hearing (\"audi alteram partem\"). While the term \"natural justice\" is often retained as a general concept, it has largely been replaced and extended by the general \"duty to act fairly\".\n\nThe basis for the rule against bias is the need to maintain public confidence in the legal system. Bias can take the form of actual bias, imputed bias or apparent bias. Actual bias is very difficult to prove in practice while imputed bias, once shown, will result in a decision being void without the need for any investigation into the likelihood or suspicion of bias. Cases from different jurisdictions currently apply two tests for apparent bias: the \"reasonable suspicion of bias\" test and the \"real likelihood of bias\" test. One view that has been taken is that the differences between these two tests are largely semantic and that they operate similarly.\n\nThe right to a fair hearing requires that individuals should not be penalized by decisions affecting their rights or legitimate expectations unless they have been given prior notice of the case, a fair opportunity to answer it, and the opportunity to present their own case. The mere fact that a decision affects rights or interests is sufficient to subject the decision to the procedures required by natural justice. In Europe, the right to a fair hearing is guaranteed by Article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights, which is said to complement the common law rather than replace it.\n\nNatural justice is a term of art that denotes specific procedural rights in the English legal system and the systems of other nations based on it. It is similar to the American concepts of fair procedure and procedural due process, the latter having roots that to some degree parallel the origins of natural justice.\n\nAlthough natural justice has an impressive ancestry and is said to express the close relationship between the common law and moral principles, the use of the term today is not to be confused with the \"natural law\" of the Canonists, the mediaeval philosophers' visions of an \"ideal pattern of society\" or the \"natural rights\" philosophy of the 18th century. Whilst the term \"natural justice\" is often retained as a general concept, in jurisdictions such as Australia, and the United Kingdom, it has largely been replaced and extended by the more general \"duty to act fairly\". Natural justice is identified with the two constituents of a fair hearing, which are the rule against bias (\"nemo iudex in causa sua\", or \"no man a judge in his own cause\"), and the right to a fair hearing (\"audi alteram partem\", or \"hear the other side\").\n\nThe requirements of natural justice or a duty to act fairly depend on the context. In \"Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\" (1999), the Supreme Court of Canada set out a list of non-exhaustive factors that would influence the content of the duty of fairness, including the nature of the decision being made and the process followed in making it, the statutory scheme under which the decision-maker operates, the importance of the decision to the person challenging it, the person's legitimate expectations, and the choice of procedure made by the decision-maker. Earlier, in \"Knight v. Indian Head School Division No. 19\" (1990), the Supreme Court held that public authorities which make decisions of a legislative and general nature do not have a duty to act fairly, while those that carry out acts of a more administrative and specific nature do. Furthermore, preliminary decisions will generally not trigger the duty to act fairly, but decisions of a more final nature may have such an effect. In addition, whether a duty to act fairly applies depends on the relationship between the public authority and the individual. No duty exists where the relationship is one of master and servant, or where the individual holds office at the pleasure of the authority. On the other hand, a duty to act fairly exists where the individual cannot be removed from office except for cause. Finally, a right to procedural fairness only exists when an authority's decision is significant and has an important impact on the individual.\n\nA person is barred from deciding any case in which he or she may be, or may fairly be suspected to be, biased. This principle embodies the basic concept of impartiality, and applies to courts of law, tribunals, arbitrators and all those having the duty to act judicially. A public authority has a duty to act judicially whenever it makes decisions that affect people's rights or interests, and not only when it applies some judicial-type procedure in arriving at decisions.\n\nThe basis on which impartiality operates is the need to maintain public confidence in the legal system. The erosion of public confidence undermines the nobility of the legal system and leads to ensuing chaos. The essence of the need for impartiality was observed by Lord Denning, the Master of the Rolls, in \"Metropolitan Properties Co (FGC) Ltd v Lannon\" (1968): \"Justice must be rooted in confidence and confidence is destroyed when right-minded people go away thinking: 'The judge was biased.'\"\n\nPublic confidence as the basis for the rule against bias is also embodied in the often-quoted words of Lord Hewart, the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, that \"[i]t is not merely of some importance, but of fundamental importance that justice should not only be done, but should manifestly be seen to be done\".\n\nBias may be actual, imputed or apparent. Actual bias is established where it is actually established that a decision-maker was prejudiced in favour of or against a party. However, in practice, the making of such an allegation is rare as it is very hard to prove.\n\nOne form of imputed bias is based on the decision-maker being a party to a suit, or having a pecuniary or proprietary interest in the outcome of the decision. Once this fact has been established, the bias is irrebuttable and disqualification is automatic – the decision-maker will be barred from adjudicating the matter without the need for any investigation into the likelihood or suspicion of bias. A classic case is \"Dimes v Grand Junction Canal\" (1852), which involved an action between Dimes, a local landowner, and the proprietors of the Grand Junction Canal, in which the Lord Chancellor, Lord Cottenham, had affirmed decrees made to the proprietors. However, it was discovered by Dimes that Lord Cottenham in fact owned several pounds worth of shares in the Grand Junction Canal. This eventually led to the judge being disqualified from deciding the case. There was no inquiry as to whether a reasonable person would consider Lord Cottenham to be biased, or as to the circumstances which led Lord Cottenham to hear the case.\n\nIn certain limited situations, bias can also be imputed when the decision-maker's interest in the decision is not pecuniary but personal. This was established in the unprecedented case of \"R v Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate Ex parte Pinochet Ugarte (No.2)\" (1999). In an appeal to the House of Lords, the Crown Prosecution Service sought to overturn a quashing order made by the Divisional Court regarding extradition warrants made against the ex-Chilean dictator, Senator Augusto Pinochet. Amnesty International (AI) was given leave to intervene in the proceedings. However, one of the judges of the case, Lord Hoffmann, was a director and chairperson of Amnesty International Charity Ltd. (AICL), a company under the control of AI. He was eventually disqualified from the case and the outcome of the proceedings set aside. The House of Lords held that the close connection between AICL and AI presented Lord Hoffmann with an interest in the outcome of the litigation. Even though it was non-pecuniary, the Law Lords took the view that the interest was sufficient to warrant Lord Hoffmann's automatic disqualification from hearing the case. In \"Locabail (UK) Ltd v Bayfield Properties Ltd\" (1999), the Court of Appeal warned against any further extension of the automatic disqualification rule, \"unless plainly required to give effect to the important underlying principles upon which the rule is based\".\n\nApparent bias is present where a judge or other decision-maker is not a party to a matter and does not have an interest in its outcome, but through his or her conduct or behaviour gives rise to a suspicion that he or she is not impartial. An issue that has arisen is the degree of suspicion which would provide the grounds on which a decision should be set aside for apparent bias. Currently, cases from various jurisdictions apply two different tests: \"real likelihood of bias\" and \"reasonable suspicion of bias\".\n\nThe real likelihood test centres on whether the facts, as assessed by the court, give rise to a real likelihood of bias. In \"R v Gough\" (1993), the House of Lords chose to state the test in terms of a \"real danger of bias\", and emphasized that the test was concerned with the possibility, not probability, of bias. Lord Goff of Chievely also stated that \"the court should look at the matter through the eyes of a reasonable man, because the court in cases such as these personifies the reasonable man\". However, the test in \"Gough\" has been disapproved of in some Commonwealth jurisdictions. One criticism is that the emphasis on the court's view of the facts gives insufficient emphasis to the perception of the public. These criticisms were addressed by the House of Lords in \"Porter v Magill\" (2001). The Court adjusted the \"Gough\" test by stating it to be \"whether the fair-minded and informed observer, having considered the facts, would conclude that there was a real possibility that the tribunal was biased\". This case therefore established the current test in the UK to be one of a \"real possibility of bias\".\n\nOn the other hand, the reasonable suspicion test asks whether a reasonable and fair-minded person sitting in court and knowing all the relevant facts would have a reasonable suspicion that a fair trial for the litigant is not possible. Although not currently adopted in the UK, this test has been endorsed by the Singapore courts.\n\nIt has been suggested that the differences between the two tests are largely semantic and that the two tests operate similarly. In \"Locabail\", the judges stated that in a large proportion of the cases, application of the two tests would lead to the same outcome. It was also held that \"[p]rovided that the court, personifying the reasonable man, takes an approach which is based on broad common sense, and without inappropriate reliance on special knowledge, the minutiae of court procedure or other matters outside the ken of the ordinary, reasonably well-informed members of the public, there should be no risk that the courts will not ensure both that justice is done and that it is perceived by the public to be done\". In the Singapore High Court decision \"Tang Kin Hwa v. Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board\" (2005), Judicial Commissioner Andrew Phang observed that the real likelihood test is in reality similar to that of reasonable suspicion. First, \"likelihood\" is in fact \"possibility\", as opposed to the higher standard of proof centring on \"probability\". Secondly, he suggested that \"real\" in \"real likelihood\" cannot be taken to mean \"actual\", as this test relates to apparent and not actual bias. He also observed that both the court's and the public's perspectives are \"integral parts of a holistic process\" with no need to draw a sharp distinction between them.\n\nIn contrast, in \"Re Shankar Alan s/o Anant Kulkarni\" (2006), Judicial Commissioner Sundaresh Menon thought that there was a real difference between the reasonable suspicion and real likelihood tests. In his opinion, \"suspicion\" suggests a belief that something that may not be provable could still be possible. \"Reasonable\" suggests that the belief cannot be fanciful. Here the issue is whether it is reasonable for the one to harbour the suspicions in the circumstances even though the suspicious behaviour could be innocent. On the other hand, \"likelihood\" points towards something being likely, and \"real\" suggests that this must be substantial rather than imagined. Here, then, the inquiry is directed more towards the actor than the observer. The issue is the degree to which a particular event is not likely or possible Menon J.C. also disagreed with both Lord Goff in \"Gough\" and Phang J.C. in \"Tang Kin Hwa\" in that he thought the shift of the inquiry from how the matter might appear to a reasonable man to whether the judge thinks there is a sufficient possibility of bias was \"a very significant point of departure\". The real likelihood test is met as long as the court is satisfied that there is a sufficient degree of possibility of bias. Although this a lower standard than satisfaction on a balance of probabilities, this is actually directed at mitigating the sheer difficulty of proving actual bias, especially given its insidious and often subconscious nature. The reasonable suspicion test, however, is met if the court is satisfied that a reasonable member of the public could harbour a reasonable suspicion of bias even though the court itself thought there was no real danger of this on the facts. The difference is that the driver behind this test is the strong public interest in ensuring public confidence in the administration of justice. As of September 2011, the Court of Appeal of Singapore had not yet expressed a view as to whether the position taken in \"Tang Kin Hwa\" or \"Shankar Alan\" is preferable.\n\nThere are cases in which a disqualified adjudicator cannot be replaced, as no one else is authorized to act. It has been observed that \"disqualification of an adjudicator will not be permitted to destroy the only tribunal with power to act\". In such cases, natural justice has to give way to necessity in order to maintain the integrity of judicial and administrative systems.\n\nThis issue regarding necessity was raised in \"Dimes\". The Lord Chancellor had to sign an order for enrolment in order to allow the appeal to proceed from the Vice-Chancellor to the House of Lords. It was held that his shareholding in the canal company which barred him from sitting in the appeal did not affect his power to enroll, as no one but him had the authority to do so. It was mentioned this was allowed \"for this [was] a case of necessity, and where that occurs the objection of interest cannot prevail\".\n\nThe court normally requests that an objection be taken as soon as the prejudiced party has knowledge of the bias. If an objection is not raised and proceedings are allowed to continue without disapproval, it will be held that the party has waived its right to do so.\n\nIn \"Dimes\", the judges advised the House of Lords that Lord Cottenham's pecuniary interest made his judgment not void, but voidable. This advice is not wrong in the context of a judicial act under review, where the judgment will be held valid unless reversed on appeal.\n\nHowever, in the cases of administrative acts or decisions under judicial review, the court can only intervene on the grounds of \"ultra vires\", hence making the judgment void. Lord Esher said in \"Allison v General Council of Medical Education and Registration\" (1894) that the participation of a disqualified person \"certainly rendered the decision wholly void\".\n\nIt has been suggested that the rule requiring a fair hearing is broad enough to include the rule against bias since a fair hearing must be an unbiased hearing. However, the rules are often treated separately. It is fundamental to fair procedure that both sides should be heard. The right to a fair hearing requires that individuals are not penalized by decisions affecting their rights or legitimate expectations unless they have been given prior notice of the cases against them, a fair opportunity to answer them, and the opportunity to present their own cases.\n\nBesides promoting an individual's liberties, the right to a fair hearing has also been used by courts as a base on which to build up fair administrative procedures. It is now well established that it is not the character of the public authority that matters but the character of the power exercised. However, in the United Kingdom prior to \"Ridge v Baldwin\" (1963), the scope of the right to a fair hearing was severely restricted by case law following \"Cooper v Wandsworth Board of Works\" (1863). In \"R v Electricity Commissioners, ex parte London Electricity Joint Committee Co. (1920), Ltd.\" (1923), Lord Atkin observed that the right only applied where decision-makers had \"the duty to act judicially\". In natural justice cases this \"dictum\" was generally understood to mean that a duty to act judicially was not to be inferred merely from the impact of a decision on the rights of subjects; such a duty would arise only if there was a \"superadded\" express obligation to follow a judicial-type procedure in arriving at the decision.\n\nIn \"Ridge v Baldwin\", Lord Reid reviewed the authorities extensively and attacked the problem at its root by demonstrating how the term \"judicial\" had been misinterpreted as requiring some additional characteristic over and above the characteristic that the power affected some person's rights. In his view, the mere fact that the power affects rights or interests is what makes it \"judicial\" and so subject to the procedures required by natural justice. This removal of the earlier misconception as to the meaning of \"judicial\" is thought to have given the judiciary the flexibility it needed to intervene in cases of judicial review.\n\nThe mere fact that a decision-maker is conferred wide discretion by law is not reason enough for a weakening of the requirements of natural justice. In the United Kingdom context, this is demonstrated by \"Ahmed v H.M. Treasury (No. 1)\" (2010). The Treasury had exercised powers to freeze the appellants' financial assets and economic resources on the ground that it reasonably suspected the appellants were or might be persons who had committed, attempted to commit, participated in or facilitated the commission of terrorism, pursuant to the Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 and the Al-Qaida and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 made under the United Nations Act 1946. The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom held that since the Al-Qaida Order made no provision for basic procedural fairness, it effectively deprived people designated under the order the fundamental right of access to a judicial remedy and hence was \"ultra vires\" the power conferred by the United Nations Act 1946 for the making of the Order.\n\nThe right to a fair hearing is also referred to in Article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which states:\n\nArticle 6 does not, however, replace the common law duty to ensure a fair hearing. It has been suggested that Article 6 alone is not enough to protect procedural due process, and only with the development of a more sophisticated common law will the protection of procedural due process extend further into the administrative machine. Nonetheless, Article 6 supplements the common law. For example, the common law does not impose a general duty to give reasons for a decision, but under Article 6(1) a decision-maker must give a reasoned judgment so as to enable an affected individual to decide whether to appeal.\n\nNatural justice allows a person to claim the right to adequate notification of the date, time, place of the hearing as well as detailed notification of the case to be met. This information allows the person adequate time to effectively prepare his or her own case and to answer the case against him or her. In \"Cooper v Wandsworth\", Chief Justice William Erle went so far as to state that the lack of notice and hearing afforded to Cooper could be said to be a form of abuse, as he had been treated as if he did not matter. As Lord Mustill famously held in \"R v Secretary of State for the Home Department Ex p Doody\" (1993): \"Since the person affected usually cannot make worthwhile representations without knowing what factors may weigh against his interests fairness will very often require that he is informed of the gist of the case which he has to answer.\"\n\nIt has been suggested that the requirement of prior notice serves three important purposes:\n\n\nThe British courts have held it is not enough for an affected person to merely be informed of a hearing. He or she must also be told what is at stake; in other words, the gist of the case.\n\nEvery person has the right to have a hearing and be allowed to present his or her own case. Should a person not attend the hearing, even with adequate notice given, the adjudicator has the discretion to decide if the hearing should proceed. In \"Ridge v Baldwin\", a chief constable succeeded in having his dismissal from service declared void as he had not been given the opportunity to make a defence. In another case, \"Chief Constable of the North Wales Police v Evans\" (1982), a chief constable required a police probationer to resign on account of allegations about his private life which he was given no fair opportunity to rebut. The House of Lords found the dismissal to be unlawful. Likewise in \"Surinder Singh Kanda v Federation of Malaya\" (1962), a public servant facing disciplinary proceedings was not supplied with a copy of a prejudicial report by a board of inquiry which the adjudicating officer had access to before the hearing. The Privy Council held that the proceedings had failed to provide him a reasonable opportunity of being heard.\n\nHowever, this requirement does not necessarily mean the decision-maker has to meet the complainant face to face – \"Natural justice does not generally demand orality\". It has been suggested that an oral hearing will almost be as good as useless if the affected person has no prior knowledge of the case. In \"Lloyd v McMahon\" (1987), an oral hearing did not make a difference to the facts on which the case was based. Giving judgment in the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, Lord Justice Harry Woolf held that an oral hearing may not always be the \"very pith of the administration of natural justice\". It has also been suggested that an oral hearing is only required if issues concerning deprivations of legal rights or legally protected interests arise.\n\nWhen deciding how the hearing should be conducted, the adjudicator has to ask whether the person charged has a proper opportunity to consider, challenge or contradict any evidence, and whether the person is also fully aware of the nature of the allegations against him or her so as to have a proper opportunity to present his or her own case. In \"Secretary of State for the Home Department v AF\" (2009), Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers said:\n\nHowever, when a hearing requires the balancing of multiple polycentric issues such as natural justice and the protection of confidential information for national security reasons, both the concerns of public security and the right to a fair trial must be adequately met. It was held by the House of Lords in \"AF\", applying the decision of the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights \"A v United Kingdom\" (2009), that a person accused of terrorism against whom a control order has been issued must be given sufficient information about the allegations against him to enable him to give effective instructions to his special advocate. If this requirement is satisfied, a fair hearing can be conducted without detailed disclosure of confidential information that might compromise national security. On the facts of the case, a special advocate was not permitted further contact with an applicant or his ordinary legal representatives except with permission of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) after viewing confidential (or \"closed\") materials. The House of Lords recognized that although a special advocate's usefulness is stymied somewhat from having no further instructions after viewing such materials, if the SIAC decides to issue a control order predominantly on the basis of non-confidential (or \"open\") materials, an applicant cannot be regarded as having been denied an opportunity to challenge the reasonableness of the government's beliefs and suspicions about him. If the evidence against the applicant is largely closed but allegations contained in open material are sufficiently specific, an applicant should be able to provide his legal representatives and special advocate with information to refute it (such as an alibi, if the open material alleges he was at a certain place during a certain period) without having to know the detail or sources of the closed evidence. However, if the evidence revealed to the person consists only of general assertions and the case against him is based solely or to a substantive extent on undisclosed adverse evidence, the fair hearing rule under natural justice will not be satisfied.\n\nIn such cases, there are strong policy considerations supporting the principle that a trial procedure can never be considered fair if a person is kept in ignorance of the case against him or her. First, since the grounds for a reasonable suspicion that a person is involved in terrorist activity can span from incontrovertible evidence to an innocent misinterpretation of facts which can be explained away by the person, in many cases it is impossible for courts to be sure that the disclosure of the evidence will make no difference to the applicant. Secondly, resentment will be felt by the person and his family and friends if sanctions are imposed without any proper explanation of the grounds and when, due to the non-disclosure of information, the person is put in a position where he is unable to properly defend himself. As Lord Phillips put it, \"if the wider public are to have confidence in the justice system, they need to be able to see that justice is done rather than being asked to take it on trust\".\n\nThe right to be heard in answer to charges before an unbiased tribunal is illustrated in the Singapore case \"Tan Boon Chee David v. Medical Council of Singapore\" (1980). During a disciplinary hearing, council members were either not conscientious about their attendance or did not attend the whole course of proceedings. This meant they did not hear all the oral evidence and submissions. The High Court held that this had substantially prejudiced the appellant and constituted a fundamental breach of natural justice. On the other hand, mere absence from a hearing does not necessarily lead to undue prejudice. It was held in \"Re Teo Choo Hong\" (1995) that the function of a lay member of a lawyers' disciplinary committee was to observe and not cast a vote or make a judgment. Thus, the appellant had not suffered undue prejudice.\n\nOn the basis of reciprocity, if one side is allowed to cross-examine his legal opponent at a hearing, the other party must also be given the same opportunity. In addition, when a tribunal decides a case on a basis not raised or contemplated by the parties, or decides it without regarding the submissions and arguments made by the parties on the issues, this will amount to a breach of natural justice. However, a genuine \"bona fide\" mistake by an adjudicator in omitting to state reasons for not considering a submission is not enough to be a breach of natural justice. This may occur when the submissions were accidentally omitted, or were so unconvincing that it was not necessary to explicitly state the adjudicator's findings.\n\nThere is no inherent common law right to legal representation before a domestic tribunal. A tribunal has the discretion to admit either a legally qualified or unqualified counsel to assist the person appearing before it, based on the facts of the case. When assessing whether a party should be offered legal assistance, the adjudicator should first ask whether the right to be heard applies, and, secondly, whether counsel's assistance is needed for an effective hearing given the subject matter, bearing in mind the consequences of such a denial.\n\nIn \"R v Secretary of State for Home Department, ex parte Tarrant\" (1983), Webster J. set out six factors to be considered when deciding whether to allow representation by counsel, namely:\n\n\nIt has also been suggested that where a tribunal hearing concerns the individual's reputation or right to livelihood, there is a greater need for allowing legal representation as this vindicates the idea of equality before the law.\n\nWhen one refuses legal representation, one cannot expect to receive a higher \"standard\" of natural justice. This was enunciated in Singapore in \"Ho Paul v. Singapore Medical Council\" (2008). Dr. Ho, who had been charged with professional misconduct, chose to appear before the Council in person and declined to cross-examine the Council's key witness. Subsequently, he argued that he should have been warned of the legal implications of not being legally represented. The High Court rejected this argument and held he had suffered no prejudice. Dr. Ho had been given a fair opportunity of presenting his own case and, most importantly, had not been deprived of his right to cross-examine the witnesses.\n\nIt is also not a court's obligation to provide assistance when a party presents his or her case without legal representation. In \"Rajeevan Edakalavan v. Public Prosecutor\" (1998), the accused had appeared in person before a magistrate and had entered a plea of guilt. He later petitioned the High Court for criminal revision, arguing that as the magistrate had not informed him of the defences available to him, his plea had been equivocal. The Court held:\n\nIn Singapore, the right to legal representation is contingent on the nature of the inquiry. However, since Article 12 of the Constitution of Singapore guarantees equal protection under the law, it has been suggested that greater weightage should be accorded to this procedural right when balancing it against the competing demand of efficiency.\n\nCurrently, the principles of natural justice in the United Kingdom and certain other jurisdictions do not include a general rule that reasons should be given for decisions. In \"R v Northumberland Compensation Appeal Tribunal, ex parte Shaw\" (1951), Denning L.J. stated: \"I think the record must contain at least the document which initiates the proceedings; the pleadings, if any; and the adjudication; but not the evidence, nor the reasons, unless the tribunal chooses to incorporate them. If the tribunal does state its reasons, and those reasons are wrong in law, certiorari lies to quash the decision.\" It has been stated that \"no single factor has inhibited the development of English administrative law as seriously as the absence of any general obligation upon public authorities to give reasons for their decisions\".\n\nHistorically, uncontrolled public decisions have led to poor outcomes and disrespect for the decision-makers. Such decisions also lacked the regularity and transparency that distinguish them from the mere say-so of public authorities. On such grounds, there are obvious benefits for the disclosure of reasons for decisions. First, procedural participation by people affected by a decision promotes the rule of law by making it more difficult for the public authority to act arbitrarily. Requiring the giving of reasons helps ensure that decisions are carefully thought through, which in turn aids in the control of administrative discretion. Secondly, accountability makes it necessary for the public authority to face up to the people affected by a decision. When a public authority acts on all the relevant considerations, this increases the probability of better decision outcomes and, as such, is beneficial to public interests. Another important benefit is that respect for decision-makers is fostered, which increases their integrity in the public's eyes.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n"}

A non profit organisations can be registered in India as a Society, under the Registrar of Societies or as a Trust, by making a Trust deed, or as a Section 8 Company, under the Companies Act, 2013.\n\nWhether a trust, society or Section 8 company, the Income Tax Act, 1961 gives all categories equal treatment, in terms of exempting their income and granting 80G certificates, whereby donors to non-profit organisations may claim a rebate against donations made. Foreign contributions to non-profits are governed by FC(R)A regulations and the Home Ministry.\n\nFor an organisation to be termed as charity it requires Income tax clearances under 12 A Clause of Income Tax Act. Section 2(15) of the Income Tax Act defines ‘charitable purpose’ to include ‘relief of the poor, education, medical relief and the advancement of any other object of general public utility’. A purpose that relates exclusively to religious teaching or worship is not considered as charitable.\n\nRegistering a Non Profit in India can be done in a total of five ways:\n\n\nA public charitable trust is usually floated when there is a property involved, especially in terms of land and building.\n\nDifferent states in India have different Trusts Acts in force, which govern the trusts in the state; in the absence of a Trusts Act in any particular state or territory the general principles of the Indian Trusts Act 1882 are applied.\n\nThe main instrument of any public charitable trust is the trust deed, wherein the aims and objects and mode of management (of the trust) should be enshrined. In every trust deed, the minimum and maximum number of trustees has to be specified. The trust deed should clearly spell out the aims and objects of the trust, how the trust should be managed, how other trustees may be appointed or removed, etc. The trust deed should be signed by both the settlor/s and trustee/s in the presence of two witnesses. The trust deed should be executed on non-judicial stamp paper, the value of which would depend on the valuation of the trust property.\n\n\nAccording to section 20 of the Societies Registration Act, 1860, the following societies can be registered under the Act: ‘charitable societies, military orphan funds or societies established at the several presidencies of India, societies established for the promotion of science, literature, or the fine arts, for instruction, the diffusion of useful knowledge, the diffusion of political education, the foundation or maintenance of libraries or reading rooms for general use among the members or open to the public, or public museums and galleries of paintings and other works of art, collection of natural history, mechanical and philosophical inventions, instruments or designs.’\n\nSocieties are registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860, which is a federal act. However, every state has its own legislation of Societies Act, which lays down the procedures for registration, management and dissolution of the Society.\n\nThe main instrument of any society is the memorandum of association and rules and regulations (no stamp paper required), wherein the aims and objects and mode of management (of the society) should be enshrined.\n\nThe main instrument of any society is the memorandum of association and article of association.\n\nMemorandum of association is the charter of a society. It is a document depicting and describing the objects of the its existence and its operations.\nHowever, article of association includes rules and regulations of the society under which it works.\n\nA Society needs a minimum of seven managing committee members; there is no upper limit to the number of managing committee members. The Board of Management is in the form of a governing body or council or a managing or executive committee\n\nRegistration can be done either at the state level (i.e., in the office of the Registrar of Societies) or at the district level (in the office of the District Magistrate or the local office of the Registrar of Societies).\n\n\nAccording to section 8(1)(a), (b) and (c) of the Indian Companies Act, 2013, a section-8 company can be established ‘for promoting commerce, art, science, sports, education, research, social welfare, religion, charity, protection of environment or any such other object’, provided the profits, if any, or other income is applied for promoting only the objectives of the company and no dividend is paid to its members.\n\nSection 8 of the Companies Act, 2013\n\nFor a section-8 company, the main instrument is a Memorandum and articles of association (no stamp paper required)\n\nA section-8 Company needs a minimum of three trustees; there is no upper limit to the number of trustees.

{"id": "38644791", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38644791", "title": "Patrick Dils", "text": "Patrick Dils\n\nPatrick Dils (born 30 June 1970 in Longeville-lès-Metz) is a French victim of a miscarriage of justice. He was accused of the murder of two boys in Montigny-lès-Metz, in Moselle on the 30th of April 1987, at the age of 16. On the 27 January 1989, the court sentenced him to life imprisonment for murder. On the 24 April 2002 after spending 15 years in prison, he was exonerated. The French government gave him one million euros (of which 700,000 euros in compensation) for judicial mistake. This is one of the most serious judicial mistakes recognized in France and it’s the first one concerning a minor sentenced to life imprisonment for murder.\n\nOn the 28 September 1986, two children, Cyril Beining born in 1978, and Alexandre Beckrich, were found dead alongside a SNCF track in Montigny-lès-Metz. Patrick Dils, who was 16 years old at the time and a trainee cook, was questioned because he was living in the same street as the victims and he was denounced by an anonymous call. His timetable did not match with the hour of the murder indicated by the coroner so he was released.\n\nOn the 28 April 1987, following a new testimony which reconsidered the time of death indicated by the coroner, he was taken in for questioning after finishing his shift at a restaurant in Montigny-lès-Metz. After 36 hours in custody and police interrogation which lasted a few days, he admitted the murders and stated that he didn’t know the reasons for the crimes.\n\nOn the 30 April 1987, he was charged with voluntary homicides and sent to the prison of Metz-Queuleu. He gave a different version to his attorney but the investigating judge organized a reconstruction on the 7 May during which he continued to admit the crime. Moreover, he recognized the rocks which served for the crime. This fact convinced the judge of his guilt. According to his parents, he didn’t realize the importance of the procedure. But, on the 30 May 1987, he wrote to his attorney to modify his declarations.\n\nSeven months passed between the murder and Dils arrest. Dils parents described Bernard Varlet, who was Inspector of Judicial Police of Metz and in charge of the investigation, as very aggressive and relentless against Dils. Varlet had already obtained confessions from two other suspects, but these were rejected.\n\nThroughout the investigation investigators obtained confessions from three different people, all single, living with their parents and having a low level of education. The first suspect who confessed was Mr. L., on 10 December 1986, who worked one hundred meters from the scene of the murder. According to the report of the hearing, he accurately described the bike and children's clothing. Police doubted his confession after he failed to climb up a slope at the crime scene during a reconstruction.\n\nOn 12 February 1987, investigators arrested a new suspect for \"outraging public decency.\" After confessing, he was eventually also exonerated because of inconsistencies in his testimony. Dils was the last remaining suspect investigators had. They believed he was guilty despite the inconsistencies that remained around the timeline of the murder, and the difficulty that a teenager may have had in causing the extreme physical violence acts perpetrated on the victims.\n\nThe judge at the time, Ms. Mireille Maubert, appeared to have the same view as the investigators. When Dils parents requested a permit to visit their son, she told them they would never see him. For sixteen months she refused to grant a permit.\n\nOn the 27 January 1989, he was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder by the juvenile \"Cour d'assises\" of Moselle. They didn’t take into account that he was minor, however, the excuse of minority which was constantly presented to the jury would have permitted to half the sentence (for the current law but at this time, being a minor would have only reduced the sentence to a maximum of 25 years). For the first time since April 1987, his parents were allowed to see him for 5 minutes in a corridor controlled by policemen. Victims’ parents said that they would have preferred the death penalty for Patrick Dils (abolished in France for minors in 1980 and then fully in 1981).\n\nDils' lawyers filed the first request for review with the Court of Cassation on 26 July 1990. The request was rejected. On 6 May 1994, Dils requested a presidential pardon from François Mitterrand, who refused him. Mitterrand wrote to the victim's family and assured them that he would never grant clemency to a murderer of children.\n\nChief Warrant Officer gendarmerie, Jean-François Abgrall, from the research section of the gendarmerie Rennes, was a specialist in cases where the serial killer Francis Heaulme was convicted, indicted or a suspect. On 24 October 1997 he sent a legal document detailing a conversation he had considered during the 1992 arrest of Heaulme in Brest. In the minutes, Abgrall wrote: \"Francis Heaulme kept us the following statement, saying he had done a bike ride along a railroad track in eastern France, have been stones thrown by two children, leaving, then passing by the scene a few minutes later, when he saw the bodies of two children near cars and garbage near a bridge, seeing the scene of firefighters and police officers.\"\n\nAbgrall immediately conducted research on any unsolved crimes involving two children. There was no trace of a double murder because at that time (1992), Patrick Dils had already been convicted and the double murder had been removed from the database.\n\nIn 1998, Dils' parents, who still believe their son was innocent, asked two lawyers, Parisian masters Jean-Marc Florand and Karim Achoui, to reconsider the case. Interested in Francis Heaulme, they sent a letter to the gendarmerie Rennes. Abgrall decided to write the minutes of the legal information, and 27 March 1998, Florand filed a new petition for review after learning that the serial killer Francis Heaulme was near the scene of the crime at the time it took place.\n\nSupreme Court magistrate, Jean Favard, began his investigation from a record of criminal intelligence. He visited Francis Heaulme and obtained new details about his schedule on 29 September 1986, the day of the double murder. At the time of the murder Heaulme worked in a business located 400 meters from the crime scene. He acknowledged having been on site at the day, time and exact location of the crimes, seeing the children having stones thrown on their heads by the two children, but denied carrying out the double murder. However, his presence is a \"new fact likely to raise doubts about the guilt of the condemned.\" The counselor rapporteur of the Committee on Revision published two reports dated 30 June 1998 and 16 July 1998.\n\nOn 21 June 1999, the board of review of criminal convictions, chaired by Henri Le Gall, found that the evidence adduced was totally unknown to the file of the Court of Assizes of minors in 1989 and can only cast doubt on Patrick Dils' guilt. He agreed to submit the file to the Dils Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court sitting as a Court of Revision. It concluded that it should order further investigations and conduct further hearings of witnesses already heard in 1986 and 1989, but by comparing the statements of Francis Heaulme.\n\nOn 21 April 2001, the Court of Revision quashed Dils' conviction but refused to release him pending a retrial. On 20 June 2001 a new trial opened before the Assize Court of the minor Marne. Francis Heaulme appeared as a witness, but he refused to take responsibility for the double murder, despite the suspicions against him. On June 29, 2001, the court sentenced Dils to twenty-five years imprisonment, to everyone's surprise. The journalists had already prepared their articles announcing his acquittal, at the time the Advocate General had expressed his personal belief: according to him, Patrick Dils could not be the culprit, he would not have had time to commit the crime. Convicted again, Patrick Dils had ten days to appeal.\n\nThe third trial in the Assize Court minors Rhône opened on 8 April 2002. The law now allowed the trial to be held in public. The majority of public opinion was in favor of Patrick Dils, who appeared with a new look, without sunglasses and relaxed. Francis Heaulme was heard again, with prosecution testimony against him. Witnesses said they saw him covered in blood the day of the incident, which he confirmed himself at the bar, claiming to have fallen off his bike. For the first time, Patrick Dils spoke of the torments he endured in prison; he was beaten, mocked and raped. He returned to his very detailed confession, which was one of the only pieces of evidence pointing to Dils' guilt.\n\nIt is still unclear exactly why Dils first accused himself at the beginning of the case. Evidence was produced by the police, showing that Patrick Dils did not have time to commit the crime: the children died around 17:00, while Patrick Dils was back home until about 18:45. On 23 April 2002, the General Counsel did not charge or penalty or sentence him, the jury deliberated for a few hours and Patrick Dils was acquitted on 24 April 2002. He was released from jail the same evening. The families of the victims were disappointed, convinced that the court had released a murderer.\n\n"}

CMPBS – is a nonprofit 501(c)3 education, research, and demonstration organization.\n\nThe CMPBS site – features numerous demonstration projects: including the „Advanced Green Builder Demonstration Home“ (AGBDH) – a 170 square meter structure, featuring numerous sustainable building techniques, including: a 50,000 liter rainwater harvesting system and two methods of straw-bale construction. The AGBDH – is the first modern building in the U.S. to use 100% Portland Cement-free concrete. The concrete used in the building – is a fly-ash, Caliche mix (developed by CMPBS). The AGBDH – was also designed for easy disassembly; pays particular attention – to the lifecycles of water, energy and materials; and incorporates local and recycled materials. The AGBDH – currently serves as the main offices for CMPBS.\n\nOther examples of Fisk's work on the CMPBS site – include the 2002 University of Texas at Austin entry for the Department of Energy Solar Decathlon competition, the Greenforms erector-set prototype and a foam and MgO Cement modular building system.\n\nPliny Fisk – currently co-directs CMPBS with his wife (Gail Vittori).\n\nWhen the „Lo Vaca Gathering Co“ shut off the natural gas supply to the small town of Crystal City (Texas) in the fall of 1977, – Fisk developed the idea of using Army surplus wood stoves and abundant mesquite for heating. By January 1978, Crystal City residents – had installed nearly 1,000 wood stoves. In subsequent years – Fisk led an effort to manufacture and install inexpensive solar hot water heaters using salvaged materials. The production of the solar collectors – also helped bolster the job market of Crystal City. \n\nIn 1983, Fisk was sponsored by the „Center for Investigation and Documentation of the Atlantic Coast“ (CIDCA) – to set into motion a large scale indigenous housing program for the Miskito Indians of Nicaragua's Atlantic Coast. Fisk's goal in the project – was to draw upon the available natural and human resources of the region to address an extreme housing shortage. He – helped develop building materials, using abundant stocks – of: \n\n\nIn 1991: the Texas Department of Agriculture (and – Laredo Junior College) – hired Fisk (and CMPBS): to design and build a demonstration farm (outside the arid South Texas city, of Laredo). The farm:\n\n\nShade structures – protect the farm (from the often extreme South Texas sun). \n\nIn 1991, Fisk and Vittori – developed \"A Conceptual and Contextual Framework (for the City of Austin)\"; that – served as the basis – for the formation of the world's first municipal green building program (now – operating as „Austin Energy Green Building“). The cooperative effort – earned the United Nations Earth Summit Award: for Exemplary Public Environmental Initiative, in 1992 (the only United States organization – to receive recognition at the Earth Summit).\n\nDeveloped in 1978, the Area Point Resource Network – is a tool for coordinating the natural, technological and human resources (within a region). The technique – identifies and maps local natural resources (“Area Source”) in suitability maps – of where sustainable methods work (or are needed), that can serve as alternatives (to more resource intensive methods). All interventions – are place-sensitive (in that: their design materiality and engineering – is suited, to that location). Second, “Point Resources,” (examples: of a successful past (or present) use, of a given resource) – are sought central, to an area resource. The flow linkages (“Network Resources”) between these examples (of people that have had success, in using the suitability areas) – defined above provide the final map, in the Area Point Resource Network. The Network Resources map – tracks four flows: \n\n\nThe overlay of the three resource types – reveals a functional web; that – coordinates resource movement, with built-in feedback mechanisms. \n\nAdditionally: a void at any hub of the web – reveals a missing resource (and – an opportunity: to improve the function, of the regional network). \n\nBaseline Green – is a methodology (initially – funded through a cooperative agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency) to design and engineer environmentally (and economically) sophisticated buildings, using national data for approximately 12 million businesses (in the continental U.S.). The approach – was developed between 1995 and 2000, – and connects four fundamental tools: \n\n\nThe Baseline Green framework – is a synthesis: of environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), economic input/output modeling – and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The methodology – is applicable at multiple construction scales: from single family residential – to large-scale commercial. The procedure – compares the upstream environmental costs (of a standard construction material) with its market cost (in dollars) – to determine the material’s “external environmental cost ratio.” The “employment impact ratio” (EIR) – is a ratio: of employment (generated by a material) t o its market value. \n\nA carbon dioxide intensity ratio (a concept, developed in 1998) – is the ratio: between the net upstream CO impact (emissions, minus storage) of a material – and the weight (of that material). A material with a \"positive\" CDIR – is a net CO source; and one with a \"negative\" CDIR – is a net CO sink. CDIR – offers an opportunity: to quantify the long-term impact, of conservation efforts. Accompanying construction standards – could help ensure: forest products – retain their carbon, by using specific construction and disposal practices. \n\nEcoBalance – is a sustainable land-use planning (and design method), that employs the principle of life-cycles as a framework – for sustaining basic life-supporting systems. It is used, as a means to address the need for planning of physical space (both: within buildings – and surrounding land). The EcoBalance method – asserts that: \"sustainability\" – is measurable (by the degree, to which – human needs are balanced, – with our ability: to manage the environment, using nature-augmenting technologies).\n\nDuring the EcoBalance planning process, – space uses – are determined and analyzed, according to the footprints (that – are necessary: to supply the basic human life support requirements – of \"air, water, food, energy and materials\" – in a regenerative fashion). The framework for EcoBalance planning – remains essentially the same (regardless of project scale), with the process typically directed toward the building, site, and master planning scales. The objective (during the planning process) – is to understand the limits of human activities: by carefully managing those activities’ resource use. In addition, the degree (to which – limits are exceeded) – is shared with the next scalar boundary; either on or off the building boundary (or – site).\n\nMeasurement of sustainability – is an integral part of the planning and design process, – and is illustrated, in multiple forms, – such as:\n\n\nThe EcoBalance Game – is an interactive tool: for undertaking the EcoBalance Planning methodology – to make decisions about future land-uses, on a given site. The game board – is (in essence) a graphic summary of site analysis data, including inventories of site characteristics and resources – such as:\n\n\nEach base map topic – may include sub-topics, such as: digital elevation model, slope, – and aspect sub-topics under topography. Each of the Base Maps – is a separate document; that can be overlaid on an aerial photo of the site and on other Base Maps. A set of five game principles – is generally used to guide play, as follows:\n\n\nProtoScope (developed in 2008) – is a method for facilitating the development of better-informed prototypes; that – are truly responsive to humans and all other living systems. By combining some of the most well-researched databases known, – ProtoScope – enables participants to understand their local context through its role: in \"ecosystem health, hydrological well being, present and future climatic impact, and the condition of the soil and mineral regimes.\" In order to reach effective and reparative management strategies, – ProtoScope – provides the necessary understanding of the most sensitive conditions (in a scalable perspective: from world – down to site). The ProtoSpace aspect of ProtoScope – reveals other sites (around the globe) with similar biophysical characteristics (in order to mine past examples of strategies, – that have succeeded, under the same conditions). ProtoPartners – are examples of people (within a ProtoSpace), who have successfully reached an understanding of balance – within one (or more) of the five balance areas: \n\n\nIn 1992 – Fisk received the United Nations Earth Summit Award: for Exemplary Public Environmental Initiative, for the City of Austin’s Green Building Program – conceived and developed by The Center for Maximum Potential Building Systems. \n\nIn 2002 – Fisk was awarded the U.S. Green Building Council’s first Sacred Tree Award: in the public sector category. He – is also a recipient of the Passive Solar Pioneer Award (from the American Solar Energy Society) and the National Center for Appropriate Technology’s 15th Year Distinguished Appropriate Technology Award, – recognizing significant work in the field of environmental protection.\n\nFisk – led two award-winning student teams for Department of Energy Solar Decathlon: \n\n\nThe US Green Building Council – honored Pliny Fisk with the USGBC Leadership Award – for \"Organizational Excellence\", in 2008: for his role – as a founding member of the American Institute of Architects Committee on the Environment.\n\n\nGail Vittori\nCenter for Maximum Potential Building Systems\n\n"}

An example is Prince Georg of Bavaria (1880–1943), who became in 1926 Protonotary by papal decree.\n\nIn later antiquity, there were in Rome seven regional notaries who, on the further development of the papal administration and the accompanying increase of the notaries, remained the supreme palace notaries of the papal chancery (\"notarii apostolici\" or \"protonotarii\"). In the Middle Ages, the protonotaries were very high papal officials and were often raised directly from this office to the cardinalate. Originally numbering seven, Pope Sixtus V (1585–90) increased their number to twelve. Their importance gradually diminished, and at the time of the French Revolution, the office had almost entirely disappeared. On 8 February 1838, Pope Gregory XVI re-established the college of real protonotaries with seven members called \"protonotarii de numero participantium\", also known as \"numerary protonotaries\", because they shared in the revenues, as officials of the Roman Chancery.\n\nSince the sixteenth century, the popes had also appointed honorary protonotaries, who enjoyed the same privileges as the seven real members of the college; and titular protonotaries, who held a corresponding position in the administration of the episcopal ordinariate or in the collegiate chapter. By the motu proprio \"Inter multiplices\" of 21 February 1905, Pope Pius X defined the position of the protonotaries: privileges, dress, and insignia of the members of the four classes: \n\nSince 1969 (following Pope Paul VI's issuing of two motus proprios, \"Pontificalis Domus\" of March 28, 1968 and \"Pontificalia Insignia\" of June 21, 1968), the four classes are reduced to two:\n\nThe name of the prothonotary warbler derives from the supposed similarity between its plumage and the golden robes worn by protonotaries.\n\n\n"}

The term is usually understood to include both federal- and state-level regulation by purely governmental regulatory agencies, but sometimes may also encompass listing requirements of exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange and rules of self-regulatory organizations like the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).\n\nOn the federal level, the primary securities regulator is the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Futures and some aspects of derivatives are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n\nFINRA, a self-regulatory organization, promulgates rules that govern broker-dealers and certain other professionals in the securities industry. It was formed when the enforcement divisions of the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), now FINRA, and of the New York Stock Exchange merged into one organization. FINRA, like the stock exchanges and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), is overseen by the SEC, and in general FINRA's rules are subject to SEC approval.\n\nAll brokers and dealers registered with the SEC under , with some exceptions, are required to be members of SIPC (pursuant to ) and are subject to its regulations.\n\nThe federal securities laws were largely created as part of the New Deal in the 1930s. There are five major federal securities laws:\n\n\nSince these laws were originally enacted, Congress has amended them many times. The Holding Company Act and the Trust Indenture Act in particular have changed significantly since then. The titles listed above, including the year of original enactment, are the so-called \"popular names\" of these laws, and practitioners in this area reference these statutes using these popular names (e.g., \"Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act\" or \"Section 5 of the Securities Act\"). When they do so, they do not generally mean the provisions of the original Acts; they mean the Acts as amended to date.\n\nWhen Congress amends the securities laws, those amendments have their own popular names (a few prominent examples include Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970, the Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984, the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988 and the Dodd-Frank Act). These acts often include provisions that state that they are amending one of the five primary laws. Other laws passed since then include Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (1995), Sarbanes–Oxley Act (2002), Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (2012), and various other .\n\nAlthough practitioners in this area use these popular names to refer to the federal securities laws, like many U.S. statutes these laws are generally codified in the U.S. Code, the official codification of U.S. statutory law. They are contained in Title 15 of the U.S. Code. Thus, for example, the official code citation for Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 is 15 U.S.C. section 77e. Not every law adopted by Congress is codified, because some are not appropriate for codification. For example, appropriations statutes are not codified.\n\nThere are also extensive regulations under these laws, largely made by the SEC. One of the most famous and often used SEC rules is Rule 10b-5, which prohibits fraud in securities transactions as well as insider trading. Because interpretations under rule 10b-5 often deem silence to be fraudulent in certain circumstances, efforts to comply with Rule 10b-5 and avoid lawsuits under 10b-5 have been responsible for a large amount of corporate disclosure.\n\nThe federal securities laws govern the offer and sale of securities and the trading of securities, activities of certain professionals in the industry, investment companies (such as mutual funds), tender offers, proxy statements, and generally the regulation of public companies. Public company regulation is largely a disclosure-driven regime, but it has grown in recent years to the point that it begins to dictate certain issues of corporate governance.\n\nState laws governing issuance and trading of securities are commonly referred to as blue sky laws.\n\nBefore the Wall Street Crash of 1929, there was little regulation of securities in the United States at the federal level. The crash spurred Congress to hold hearings, known as the Pecora Commission, after Ferdinand Pecora.\n\nAfter the hearings Congress passed the Securities Act of 1933 prescribing rules for the interstate sales of securities, and made it illegal to sell securities in a state without complying with that state's laws. The statute requires a publicly-traded company to register with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The registration statement provides a broad range of information about the company and is a public record. The SEC does not approve or disapprove the issue of securities, but rather permits the filing statement to \"become effective\" if sufficient required detail is provided, including risk factors. The company can then begin selling the stock issue, usually through investment bankers.\n\nThe following year, Congress passed the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, to regulate the secondary market (general-public) trading of securities. Initially, the 1934 Act applied only to stock exchanges and their listed companies, as the name implies. In the late 1930s, it was amended to provide regulation of the over-the-counter (OTC) market (i.e., trades between individuals with no stock exchange involved). In 1964, the Act was amended to apply to companies traded in the OTC market.\n\nCourts interpreted the laws, assembling a body of . In 1988 the Supreme Court of the United States decided \"Basic Inc. v. Levinson\", which allowed class action lawsuits under SEC Rule 10b-5 and the \"fraud-on-the-market\" theory, which resulted in an increase in securities class actions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and the state model law Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act was a response to class actions.\n\nIn October 2000, the SEC issued the Regulation Fair Disclosure regulation (Reg FD), which required publicly traded companies to disclose material information to all investors at the same time. Reg FD helped level the playing field for all investors by helping to reduce the problem of selective disclosure.\n\nIn 2010, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was passed to reform securities law in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007–2008.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "23193932", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23193932", "title": "Silver Alert", "text": "Silver Alert\n\nA Silver Alert is a public notification system in the United States to broadcast information about missing persons – especially senior citizens with Alzheimer's disease, dementia, or other mental disabilities – in order to aid in locating them.\n\nSilver Alerts use a wide array of media outlets – such as commercial radio stations, television stations, and cable television – to broadcast information about missing persons. In some states (specifically Arizona, Florida, New Jersey, Texas, and Wisconsin), Silver Alerts also use variable-message signs on roadways to alert motorists to be on the lookout for missing seniors. In cases in which a missing person is believed to be missing on foot, Silver Alerts have used Reverse 911 or other emergency notification systems to notify nearby residents of the neighborhood surrounding the missing person's last known location. Silver alerts can also be used for children who are missing without being in danger or abducted. \n\nSupporters of Silver Alert point to the U.S.A's growing elderly population as a reason to support new programs to locate missing seniors. Approximately six in ten dementia victims will wander off at least once. If not found within 24 hours, up to half of \nwandering seniors with dementia suffer serious injury or death.\n\nActivation criteria for Silver Alerts vary from state to state. Some states limit Silver Alerts to persons over the age of 65 who have been medically diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, dementia, or a mental disability. Other states expand Silver Alert to include all children and adults with mental or developmental disabilities. In general, the decision to issue a Silver Alert is made by the law enforcement agency investigating the report of a missing person. Public information in a Silver Alert usually consists of the name and description of the missing person and a description of the missing person's vehicle and license plate number, e.g. \"David Smith GRN 2002 Oldsmobile Bravada FL LIC 989 ARN\".\n\nIn December 2005, Oklahoma state Representative Fred Perry (R-Tulsa) announced his intention to introduce an \"AMBER Alert for seniors\", which he dubbed \"Silver Alert.\" In March 2006, the Oklahoma House of Representatives passed H.R. 1075, a resolution calling for a Silver Alert system to find missing seniors. In response to this non-binding resolution, the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety added Silver Alert notifications to the statewide alerts sent to law enforcement agencies and the media for rapid distribution. In April 2009, Governor Brad Henry signed legislation permanently establishing the Silver Alert program.\n\nIn Georgia, public efforts to locate missing seniors increased following the April 2004 disappearance of Mattie Moore, a 68-year-old Atlanta resident with Alzheimer's disease. Eight months after Moore's disappearance, her body was found 500 yards (460 m) from her home. The City of Atlanta created \"Mattie's Call\" to coordinate and support Metro Atlanta law enforcement, emergency management and broadcasters to issue an urgent bulletin in missing persons cases involving persons with Alzheimer's disease, dementia and other mental disabilities. Legislation to create a statewide Mattie's Call program was enacted in April 2006.\n\nIn Florida, Mary Zelter, an 86-year-old resident of Largo, drove away from her assisted-living facility on February 26, 2008, and never returned. Her body was found a week later away in the Intracoastal Waterway near a Clearwater boat ramp. Her submerged car was nearby. This tragedy prompted Pinellas County officials to create a Silver Alert pilot program that later grew into a statewide initiative.\nThirty-seven states and the District of Columbia have Silver Alert or similar programs targeting missing seniors. \nTwenty-eight states and the District of Columbia have missing persons recovery programs that are formally called \"Silver Alert\":\nAdditionally, nine states have programs to help locate missing seniors that are not officially called \"Silver Alert\" but contain criteria similar to existing Silver Alert programs:\nPlus, nine states have missing-persons alert systems with broader criteria than conventional Silver Alert programs. These missing-person alerts apply to larger categories of endangered persons, or apply to all missing people, regardless of age or impairment:\n\nIn May 2008, Representative Lloyd Doggett introduced the National Silver Alert Act in the U.S. House of Representatives, a bill to encourage, enhance, and integrate Silver Alert plans throughout the United States. Similar legislation was filed by Representatives Gus Bilirakis (R-FL) and Sue Myrick (R-NC). The three bills were combined into a single bill, H.R. 6064. The bill was passed by the House in September 2008 by a voice vote, but the 110th Congress adjourned before it could be considered in the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe National Silver Alert Act was re-introduced in the 111th Congress as H.R. 632. It was passed by the House of Representatives on February 11, 2009, on a voice vote. Companion legislation (S.557) was introduced in the Senate by Senator Mel Martinez (R-FL) and Senator Herb Kohl (D-WI).\n\nS.1814, the National Silver Alert Act, is currently pending in the 113th Congress. It was reintroduced by Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) on December 12, 2013.\n\nThe National Silver Alert Act has been endorsed by the Assisted Living Federation of America (ALFA), Alzheimer's Association, Alzheimer's Foundation of America, Elder Justice Coalition, National Silver Haired Congress, the National Association of Police Organizations and the National Sheriffs' Association.\n\nCritics of Silver Alert have raised concerns that the proliferation of color-coded alerts will reduce their importance, risking that alerts would be ignored as a \"wolf cry\". For example, Texas has created an Amber Alert, Silver Alert and Blue Alert (issued to locate an assailant in the event a law enforcement officer is killed or injured.) In New York, Governor George Pataki vetoed Silver Alert legislation in 2003, citing his concern that it would weaken the Amber Alert system and make the alerts too common. In the absence of state-level legislation, local Silver Alert programs have been enacted by New York City and five New York counties: Rockland, Suffolk, Nassau, Niagara and Erie.\n\nSome critics have raised concerns about the cost of implementing the Silver Alert program on a nationwide basis. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that implementation of the National Silver Alert Act would cost $59 million over a five-year period. During the House debate on the cost Representative Ted Poe (R-TX) noted that states with Silver Alerts have reported nominal costs associated with operating the system, since they are able to utilize existing Amber Alert infrastructure to issue Silver Alerts.\n\nBecause the implementation of Silver Alert systems vary from state to state, there are no national statistics for the retrieval rates resulting from Silver Alerts. However, among states that publicly release statistics, retrieval rates indicate a high level of success. For example, In North Carolina, 128 Silver Alerts were issued in 2008. Of these, 118 seniors were safely recovered.\n\nIn Georgia, Mattie's Call garnered a safe return for 70 of the 71 calls issued between its inception in 2006 and January 2009.\n\nIn Texas, the Silver Alert system was invoked 52 times in the first year following its inception in September 2007. Of these alerts, 48 of the missing seniors were located safely, and 13 of these recoveries were directly attributable to Silver Alert.\n\nIn Florida, 136 Silver Alerts were issued in its first year (2008–2009), leading to 131 safe recoveries. 19 of these recoveries were directly attributable to Silver Alert. Over two years, 227 Silver Alerts have been issued in Florida – with 220 seniors located safely, and 36 of those recoveries attributed directly to the Silver Alert. Over three years, 377 Silver Alerts have been issued in Florida, with 367 seniors located safely, and 51 of those recoveries attributed directly to the Silver Alert.\n\nIn Wisconsin, 18 Silver Alerts were issued in the first 5 months of the program, out of which 15 of missing seniors were found and safely returned home.\n\n\n"}

It is the world's biggest e-commerce website, as well as the eighth most visited website in the world according to Alexa. As of 31 March 2018, Taobao has over 617 million monthly active users \n\nFounded by Alibaba Group in 2003, Taobao Marketplace facilitates consumer-to-consumer (C2C) retail by providing a platform for small businesses and individual entrepreneurs to open online stores that mainly cater to consumers in Chinese-speaking regions (Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan) and also abroad.\n\nWith over 1 billion product listings as of 2016, the combined transaction volume of Taobao Marketplace and Tmall.com reached 3 trillion yuan in 2017, more than that of all US retailers and e-commerce sites combined. \"The Economist\" calls it \"the country's biggest online marketplace\".\nSellers are able to post goods for sale either through a fixed price or auction. Auctions make up a small percentage of transactions. The majority of the products are new merchandise sold at fixed prices. Buyers can assess seller backgrounds by information available on the site, including ratings, comments and complaints.\n\nOn 29 March 2016, Alibaba group CEO Zhang Yong claimed a clear strategy for the future of Taobao: community, content, and local life, the three directions.\n\nTaobao Marketplace (formerly \"Taobao\") was launched in May 2003 by Alibaba after eBay acquired Eachnet, China's online auction leader at the time, for US$180 million and became a major player in the Chinese consumer e-commerce market. To counter eBay's expansion, Taobao offered free listings to sellers and introduced website features designed to act in local consumers' best interests, such as instant messaging for facilitating buyer-seller communication and an escrow-based payment tool, Alipay. As a result, Taobao became mainland China's undisputed market leader within two years. Its market share surged from 8% to 59% between 2003 and 2005, while eBay China plunged from 79% to 36%. EBay shut down its China site in 2006.\n\nIn April 2008, Taobao introduced a newly dedicated B2C platform called Taobao Mall to complement its C2C marketplace. Taobao Mall established itself as the destination for quality brand name goods for Chinese consumers. Taobao Mall launched an independent web domain, Tmall.com, and enhanced its focus on product verticals and improvements in shopping experience in November 2010. It became an independent business in June 2011 and changed its Chinese name to Tian Mao (Tmall) in January 2012. As of October 2013 it was the eighth most visited web site in China.\n\nIn 2008, Taobao fueled the overall growth of the Chinese online shopping industry through execution of the “Big Taobao” strategy with the aim of becoming a provider of e-commerce infrastructure services for all e-commerce market participants.\n\nIn October 2010, Taobao beta launched eTao as an independent searching engine for online shopping, providing product and merchant information from a number of major consumer e-commerce websites in China. Online shoppers can use the site to compare prices from different sellers and identify products to buy. According to the Alibaba Group web site, eTao offers products from Amazon China, Dangdang, Gome, Yihaodian, Nike China and Vancl, as well as Taobao and Tmall.\n\nIn May 2011, Alibaba Group opened a retail store in Beijing under the Taobao Mall brand. The five-story 25,000sqm Taobao Mall iFengChao Furniture Showroom opened as a complement to their online stores.\n\nIn June 2011, Alibaba Group Executive Chairman and former CEO Jack Ma announced that Taobao would split into three different companies: Taobao Marketplace (a C2C platform), Tmall.com (a B2C platform; then called Taobao Mall), and eTao (a search engine for online shopping). The move was said to be necessary for Taobao to “meet competitive threats that emerged in the past two years during which the Internet and e-commerce landscape has changed dramatically.”\n\nFrom 2012 onward, Taobao began to accept international Visa and MasterCard credit and debit cards; prior, only domestic banks were supported by AliPay.\n\nOn April 29, 2013, Alibaba announced an investment of US$586 million in Sina Weibo. According to Reuters, the deal “should drive more web traffic to Alibaba's Taobao Marketplace, China's largest e-commerce website with a consumer focus.” On August 1, 2013, Alibaba launched Weibo for Taobao, which allows users to link Sina Weibo accounts with Taobao accounts.\n\nTaobao's mascot is an ant, which represents their corporate culture. Ma introduced Taobao to the outside world by stating, \"We are the ant army.\" Ma once organized more than 2,000 employees at a gymnasium to celebrate the 5th anniversary of the founding ceremony. At the party, Taobao employees waved the Taobao mascot — the flag of \"ants.\" At the end of the celebration that lasted for four hours, all the employees stood hand-in-hand, singing \"If you do not experience wind and rain, you cannot see the rainbow. The ants that be organized together can beat the elephant.\"\n\nTo thoroughly investigate a Taobao shop, a good way is to view its feedback by clicking the shop's rating icon. For Tmall.com shops, people click the stars to view their ratings. Taobao users usually spend time to read feedback and compare items of one shop with those of others. Feedback put up by the user can be genuine or made up which users have to thoroughly read through to conclude. If the feedback style and tone is same, likely, it's made up. Some of the feedback can also be posted by competitors. Users have to look at the majority of the feedback to deduce whether the feedback are genuine. The best way to conclude whether the item is truly worth buying is to look at the available feedback that are posted by users after they've used the item for a period of time.\n\nFor every trade deal on Taobao, there must be a section of customer feedback, which is a determination factor of the sale volume for the shop. Therefore, the shop owners often put effort to maximize the positive comments and eliminate the negative ones. Even profitable negotiations happen between sellers and the consumers for rating their satisfactions toward the commodity and their shopping experiences. \nIn order to collect public perspectives towards Taobao services, searching tools and other functions are used to determine and learn the users’ demands, which could help Taobao make more improvements; There are also surveys handed out to Taobao consumers including the following parts:\n\n·The obstacles that you encounter while using the product.\n\n·Your advises and reviews of the product.\n\n·The frequencies of your uses on the product, or the importance of that particular product to the users themselves.\n\n·The satisfaction level towards the specific aspects, including visual and typographic layout, procedure and instruction guide.\n\n·The overall satisfaction level towards the product.\n\nLaunched in 2004, Alipay (), an escrow-based online payment platform, is the preferred payment solution for transactions on Taobao Marketplace. It is the most widely used third-party online payment solution in China. To ensure safe transactions, Alipay uses an escrow system through which payment is only released to the seller once the buyer has received his or her goods in satisfactory condition. According to the Alibaba Group web site, Alipay is partnered with multiple financial institutions as well as Visa and MasterCard to facilitate payments in China and abroad. \n\nAlipay systems are separate for different groups of users. For instance, Alipay users may send and receive funds if they have an account that added a credit card issued in China, whereas users who use credit cards issued outside China may only use Alipay to pay for goods or services from Taobao. This has proven problematic for international users of Taobao, as they are unable to receive refunds that are not issued via the Taobao system.\n\nRegulatory changes issued by the People's Bank of China (Central Bank of China) are set to alter the Chinese online payment ecosystem forever. Top-tier digital payment services such as WeChat Pay and Alipay are expected to transfer all relevant transaction data to appropriate agencies starting June 30th, 2018.\n\nAliExpress was created in April 2010 as an international retailing website. People who live overseas can use the service to purchase items from Chinese manufactures online.\n\nA distinctive feature of shopping on Taobao Marketplace is the ease of communication between buyer and seller prior to the purchase through its embedded proprietary instant chat program, named AliWangWang (). It has become a habit among Chinese online shoppers to interact with the sellers through AliWangWang to inquire about products and to bargain prior to purchasing products.\n\nIn February 2016, 3 expats living in Shanghai launched Baopals, a shopping platform that translates Taobao and Tmall into English so that foreigners living in China can access all of its products and services. Currently, over 1.2 million items have been sold on the platform.\n\nIn Dec. 2009, Taobao, together with Hunan TV, set up Happy Taobao, Inc for television shopping. Hunan TV launched an entertainment series called \"Happy Taobao\", while Taobao Marketplace created channels and independent websites.\n\nTaobao Marketplace introduced various features and services to create a better user experience for online shoppers and retailers. For instance, in January 2010, it launched the Taobao app, created by independent developers through the Taobao Open Platform, to be downloaded by consumers in Taobao App Store.\n\nIn March 2010, it introduced the Taobao Data Cube platform, which gives small businesses access to its aggregate consumer transactions data for insight into industry trends.\n\nIn June 2010, it partnered with Wasu Media Internet Limited to launch Taohua, a digital entertainment products platform, and interactive digital television shopping, that are operated by a joint-venture formed by the two companies.\n\nSingles' Day (also known as the Double eleven shopping carnival) is the Chinese largest online shopping day in 11th, Nov., which dates from 11th, Nov. 2009 by the Taobao mall. It takes the advantages of the Chinese single day which is created by Chinese students in university to celebrate their bachelordom. After the event was launched, it obtained unexpected attention so many other e-commerce company tried to imitate this model. However, Taobao mall is still the best beneficiary by its accurate and powerful promotion skills till now.\n\nThe double eleven shopping day has gained a large number of profit for Taobao since 2009. The sales value on double eleven in 2009 was RMB50 million (￡5.68 million) and the value has increased sharply to RMB35 billion (￡3.97 billion) and the RMB1.5 billion(￡170million) was gained.<ref name=\"Review of Sales Value on Double 11: 2009-2013 Read more: https://www.chinainternetwatch.com/10400/review-sales-value-double-11-2009-2013/#ixzz5ABnxGZPl\"></ref>\n\nHere are the volume of transaction from 2009 to 2013 on Taobao mall for November 11:\n\n2009: RMB50 million (￡5.68 million)\n\n2010: RMB900 million (￡102 million)\n\n2011: RMB3.4 billion (￡386 million)\n\n2012: RMB19.1 billion (￡2.17 billion)\n\n2013: RMB35 billion (￡3.97 billion)\n\nIt also shows great power from 2014 to 2018, with the volume of transaction from 213.5 billion in 2018.\n\nThe continuous succese of Taobao mall double eleven shopping carnival contributes to its varieties of promotion skills and the supportive of quantities of firms. In 2016, Alibaba has introduce the T-mall double eleven party, it invited many popular stars, singers and supermodel who were took part in Victoria secret show. THE party also invited international star such as Scarlett Johansson, Kobe Bryant and the Beckhams. In the 2017 double eleven party, Jack Ma came out with his new micro film called 'Gongshoudao' which means defend the homeland with Kungfu.\n\nNow, because of the huge trading volume and income in Singles Day(11/11), Taobao has launched another promotional activity on December 12th, which is the similar e-commerce sales day to Singles Day. Since then, the volume of trading has set a new high every year.\n\nOn March 29, 2016, the CEO of Alibaba group, Daniel Zhang, pointed out the three directions of the future development goals for Taobao: more community-based, more content-enabled and local adapted in the 2016 annual customer conference held in Hangzhou.\nTaobao extensively uses shopping strategies such as data personalizing, customer loyalties, video broadcasting and the focused demand of a single community to build stages for sellers to display their commodities. It is strictly constructing a new ecosystem from content producing, to content propagating, and content consuming with Alibaba's cooperating internet platforms like Youku, Weibo, Alimama and Alifilms. \nExcept for using centralized and demand-matching supplies depending on the need of users to form a self-operational system of content producing and consuming transmission, Taobao also improved the quality of the commodity and its services towards the consumers.\n\nTaobao applies a searching tool named 'adaptive agents'. An adaptive agent picks up the signals from consumers’ purchase records, including categories, brands, functions and colors etc.; The search engine involves the scanning of a particular bar code. Taobao tracks customers' purchasing history and reorganize it into a series of selections that the buyers are likely to be attracted to. The way that an adaptive agent works is image prior models plus the posterior data using BAYES theory (LAPLACE method):\nThe possibility of the occurrence of a certain event can be estimated through the frequency of its occurrence in the past.\nThe ranking of a product or a page can be determined by the combination of its prior information plus its posterior data of click transaction.\n\nThe popularity of Taobao's searching model is based on the calculation of correlation rate and quality scores:\n\nTaobao increased its traffic by launching an app.\n\nTaobao automatically classifies the text and images of the product, and uses tags to make the correlation match. The usage of the semantic search is to solve the correlative problem that key word texts cannot solve, such as images, complex texts, and ambiguous texts. Semantic search is also a way of recommendation that Taobao presents with more similar items consumers might find when searching one keyword. There are entity tagging and other classifications.\n\nIn September, 2013, Taobao launched its Southeast Asian site. A translation feature is now available on Taobao.com for major languages in Southeast Asia.\n\nIn August 2017, in order to protect African children from being commercially exploited, the company has removed a controversial vendor ad campaign.\n\nTaobao Marketplace had more than 5 million registered users as of June 2013 and hosted more than 80 million product listings. It facilitated approximately RMB 200 billion in gross merchandise volume in 2009. In September 2013, Taobao ranked 12th overall in Alexa's internet rankings. For the year ending March 31, 2013, the combined gross merchandise volume (GMV) of Taobao and Tmall.com combined exceeded RMB 1 trillion.\n\n\n ln in One Hour Alibaba Double 11 Sales Exceeded $2 Bln in One Hour\"></ref>\n"}
{"id": "3457884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3457884", "title": "Taylor Law", "text": "Taylor Law\n\nThe Public Employees Fair Employment Act (more commonly known as the Taylor Law) refers to Article 14 of the New York State Civil Service Law, which defines the rights and limitations of unions for public employees in New York.\n\nThe Public Employees Fair Employment Act (the Taylor Law) is a New York State statute, named after labor researcher George W. Taylor. It authorizes a governor-appointed State Public Employment Relations Board to resolve contract disputes for public employees while curtailing their right to strike.\n\nThe law provides for mediation and binding arbitration to give voice to unions, but work stoppages are made punishable with fines and jail time. The United Federation of Teachers and the Uniformed Sanitationmen’s Association challenged the Taylor Law at its 1967 inception. Following a 2005 strike, Transit Workers’ president Roger Toussaint was incarcerated for three days as per a Taylor Law ruling.\n\nThe Taylor Law grants public employees the right to organize and elect their union representatives. It defines the boundaries for public employers in negotiating and entering into agreements with public unions. The law also defines the terms for the foundation of the Public Employment Relations Board, a state agency that administers the law in matters related to public strike negotiation. The board consists of three members appointed by the governor. Each member must be approved by the senate, and only two may be of the same political party.\n\nOne of the most controversial parts of the Taylor Law is Section 210, which prohibits New York state public employees from striking. For certain unions, primarily law enforcement (such as police officers), it provides for compelling binding PERB arbitration in the event of an impasse in negotiations. For others, except for law enforcement unions, it provides for non-binding \"fact-finding,\" in which a panel of arbitrators make a recommendation to the parties on what is considered a fair settlement of the dispute.\n\nThe penalties for striking is an additional day of pay for each day of a strike, totaling two days' loss for each strike day, removal of the \"Dues Check-off\", and imprisonment of the Union's President.\n\nThe law does not apply to Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North Railroad and Staten Island Railway employees, who are subjected to the jurisdiction of the Federal Railway Labor Act of 1926.\n\nThe law was put into effect in 1967, following costly transit strikes the previous year and is named for George W. Taylor, chairman of the commission appointed by NY Governor Nelson Rockefeller to propose amendments to the Condon-Wadlin Act.\n\nTaylor was a professor of industrial research at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton school for forty years before his death in 1972. He served as an advisor on labor relations issues to Presidents Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson. Taylor was a strong supporter of the strike in private sector bargaining.\n\nSince its declaration, the law has been cited in preventing public employee strikes. However, public employees have struck since the introduction of the law:\n\nThe United Federation of Teachers struck in Ocean Hill-Brownsville strike of 1968 and struck for five days over the issue of class size in 1975.\n\nThe fine was applied during the New York City Transit Authority 1980 transit strike and was applied again in the 2005 transit strike (involving both the Transit Authority and a separate unit of the MTA, MTA Bus Company (for the latter, only workers who were members of Transport Workers Union (TWU) Local 100).\n\nDuring the 2005 transit strike, both the strikers and the MTA violated portions of the Taylor Law. Section 210 states that the workers are not allowed to strike; Section 201, Part 4, states that employers are not allowed to negotiate benefits provided by a public retirement fund or payment to a fund or insurer to provide an income for retirees.\n\nIn addition, in the wake of the 2005 strike, the New York State Supreme Court in Kings County (Brooklyn), declared TWU Local 100 in violation of the Taylor Law, and issued a fine of $1,000,000 per day, pursuant with the guidelines set forth in the law. Two smaller unions also representing NYC Transit Authority workers, Amalgamated Transit Union Locals 726 and 1056, were fined smaller amounts.\n\nWhile government officials support the Taylor Law as a way of preventing strikes by municipal unions in New York, the unions contend that the law is harsh on them. The labor unions also contend that the Taylor Law does not provide government agencies the incentive to negotiate contracts on a timely basis and negotiate the terms of the contract in good faith. There have been lobbying efforts by municipal unions to the New York state legislature to change the Taylor Law, but there is some resistance or reluctance to modifying the law.\n\nWith the creation and assistance of the Taylor Law, members of many organizations including the Albany, NY Fire Department were able to unionize, becoming one of the strongest political organizations. In 1970 was the birth of Union Local 2007, which was also responsible in paving the way for all other public sector unions in Albany, New York.\n\nThe Taylor Law has been a frequent target for Upstate New York anti-union activists; they claim that it severely limits the ability of governments to limit spending on unionized labor, with minimal recourse in the event the unions illegally strike.\n\nOne particular clause, the Triborough Amendment, mandates that in the event of a lack of a contract, the terms of the previous contract continue indefinitely. This amendment protects workers when contracts expire before an agreement is reached, as otherwise, governments could simply wait until contracts expire, and then unilaterally alter the terms. \nThe Conservative Party of New York State, which seeks the abolition of the amendment, argues that the amendment's guarantee of a perpetual contract eliminates any incentive for unions to negotiate in good faith.\n\nOthers have made the argument that while there is no corollary to the Triborough Amendment under the National Labor Relations Act, which governs private sector workers, those workers may strike at impasse. Some unions believe it would be fundamentally unfair to eliminate the Triborough Amendment but at the same time continuing the Taylor Law's prohibition against strikes. To do so would provide no incentive for management to negotiate a fair contract since it could always just change the contract as it saw fit after reaching impasse, leaving the workers and unions with no legal recourse. That would be completely unprecedented in American Labor law.\n\nThe Buffalo Teachers Federation, for instance, illegally struck in September 2000, which delayed the start of the school year.\n\n"}

The penalty for violating a legislative or court-imposed time constraint may be anything from a small fine to judicial determination of an entire case against one's interests.\n\nFor example, if a complaining party files an action and then fails to cause the papers pertaining thereto to be served on the opposing party within the time established by local rules, and is unable to convince the court that there was good and sufficient reason for the delay, he risks having his action dismissed with prejudice. If the opposing party is served with the papers and Anil fails to respond within the time limit provided for his answer, he risks having the case decided against him by default.\n\nIf one is aggrieved by the judicial outcome of an action and wishes to appeal, he may be forever barred from doing so if he fails to meet the deadline by which his appeal may be filed.\n\nBy court order, or by local rule, there may be other time constraints. One may be required to answer interrogatories or a request to produce or other discovery pleadings within a given time.

{"id": "3515575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3515575", "title": "United States v Burns", "text": "United States v Burns\n\nUnited States v Burns [2001] 1 S.C.R. 283, 2001 SCC 7, was a decision by the Supreme Court of Canada in which it was found that extradition of individuals to places where they may face the death penalty is a breach of fundamental justice under section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The decision reached this conclusion through a discussion of evidence regarding the arbitrary nature of execution, although the Court did not go so far as to say execution was also unconstitutional under section 12 of the Charter, which forbids cruel and unusual punishments.\n\nThe case essentially overruled \"Kindler v Canada (Minister of Justice)\" (1991) and \"Reference Re Ng Extradition\" (1991). In \"Burns\", the Supreme Court justices claimed to be considering different kinds of evidence.\n\nThe police department in Bellevue, Washington, of the United States accused two Canadian citizens, Glen Sebastian Burns and Atif Ahmad Rafay, of murdering Rafay's family. After returning to Canada, Burns and Rafay confessed to undercover Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The RCMP used the Mr. Big tactic to extract the confessions, a practice that is illegal in the United States, but was legal at the time in Canada. After the investigation was complete, Burns and Rafay claimed their confessions were false, highly manipulated, and that jurors were biased by the media coverage of the crime. Nonetheless, plans were made to extradite Burns and Rafay.\n\nThe extradition would be possible through an extradition treaty under which the Minister of Justice for Canada may seek assurances that the fugitive accused would not be subject to the death penalty. However, the Minister of Justice did not seek assurances in the case. Burns and Rafay launched a number of Charter challenges to the Canadian government's decision, including that section 6 mobility rights provided them rights against extradition and to be charged in Canada (since the murders occurred in the US, Canada could only charge them with planning the crime, so this option was ruled out). \n\nIt was further argued that, while the \"Kindler\" case had held that it was not a breach of fundamental justice to extradite persons regardless of the risk of execution, the Burns case was special because it involved Canadian citizens; section 6 rights against exile were used to reinforce this argument.\n\nThe decision of the Court was unanimous and anonymously written, and held that extradition in this case, involving the risk of execution, would indeed be unconstitutional under the Charter. Indeed, the government of Canada should always try to avoid execution, except in \"exceptional circumstances\" (likely to be crimes against humanity). However, the Court rejected any arguments made under section 6, by citing precedent that while extradition, in and of itself, violates section 6, this was permissible under the reasonable limits clause in section 1 of the Charter. The Court also found it useful to cite the case \"Re Federal Republic of Germany and Rauca\". Since the rights claimant in that case was extradited even though he was so old he would probably die in prison, and thus his rights to return to Canada would be constitutionally denied, it made sense that in this case Burns and Rafay's rights to return could also be constitutionally denied. (Whether executed or given a life sentence, Burns and Rafay, if convicted, were not expected to return).\n\nThe Court also declined to consider the case on the basis of the section 12 ban on cruel and unusual punishments. This was because section 32 makes section 12 binding only on punishments dispensed by the Canadian government, not the US government. While \"Burns\" might then be of little relevance to a section 12 debate if the Canadian government restored the death penalty in Canada, the Court did hint that execution \"engages the underlying values of the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment,\" noting its impossibility to correct (in cases of wrongful conviction) and its perceived arbitrary nature.\n\nWhile section 12 was of little direct consequence in \"Burns\", there was precedent that the government of Canada has some responsibility to consider possible outcomes of extradition under section 7 of the Charter (and section 12, like other legal rights, helps to define the broad principles of section 7). \n\nSection 7 guarantees rights to life, liberty and security of the person, to be deprived only with respect to fundamental justice. The applicability of section 7 was thus evident through the infringement of Burns and Rafay's right to life, liberty and security of the person, since \"Their lives are potentially at risk.\" \n\nExtradition might then breach fundamental justice because, according to precedent in \"Canada v Schmidt\", if the harm faced by the extradited persons is serious enough, it \"shocks the conscience\" of the Canadian population. Still, the \"Kindler\" case had indicated that extradition regardless of the risk of execution was not a breach of section 7. The Court in \"Burns\" thus had to overrule this. \n\nWhile acknowledging \"Kindler\"'s \"balancing process\", the Court wrote that various factors considered in this process will change with the times, and in this case the Court was confronted with more of the \"practical and philosophic difficulties associated with the death penalty\".\n\nIn considering the relationship between fundamental justice and execution, the Court wrote that \"philosophic\" views of fundamental justice that viewed execution as \"inconsistent with the sanctity of human life\" were not subject to judicial review, and that the Court could instead consider more legal issues such as \"the protection of the innocent, the avoidance of miscarriages of justice, and the rectification of miscarriages of justice where they are found to exist.\" Hence wrongful convictions were especially to be feared in cases involving execution.\n\nThere were arguments that allowing a risk of execution could be compatible with fundamental justice, since the accused had committed a crime in another state and thus no longer had the benefits of Canadian law, and since states should work together to fight crime. However, there were also arguments that this extradition was contrary to fundamental justice. These included that execution no longer existed in Canada itself, and the legal importance of this state of affairs was reinforced by 40 years of continuity. \n\nThe Court also cited \"Reference Re BC Motor Vehicle Act\" to note that international law was important in defining fundamental justice, and while there was no international law against execution per se, international politics are moving in that direction, and more and more states have abolished the death penalty.\n\nThe Court paid a fair amount of attention to the risk of wrongful conviction, and how the Court had a duty to protect the innocent. This duty is based in part on section 11 of the Charter, which includes a right to, for example, presumption of innocence. To illustrate this point, cases of wrongful convictions were cited from Canada (the case of Donald Marshall, Jr. was specifically mentioned), the US and the United Kingdom. \n\nWhile \"[t]hese miscarriages of justice of course represent a tiny and wholly exceptional fraction of the workload of Canadian courts in murder cases,\" the Court wrote, \"where capital punishment is sought, the state's execution of even one innocent person is one too many.\" The Court also acknowledged the \"death row phenomenon\" as a section 7 concern, noting the psychological stress that would be involved if one is sentenced to die.\n\nThe Court cited statements from parliament on capital punishment. The judgement noted that parliament abolished the last death penalty under Canadian law in 1998 with amendments to the \"National Defence Act\". The court cited statements by the Cabinet to characterize this and other acts of Parliament. \"In his letter to the respondents, the Minister of Justice emphasized that 'in Canada, Parliament has decided that capital punishment is not an appropriate penalty for crimes committed here...'.\"\n\nIn balancing the arguments that this extradition could be compatible or contrary to fundamental justice, the Court concluded that many of the goals of the Crown could have been met even if Canada had requested that the US would not seek the death penalty. There was thus an infringement of section 7, and the Court then had to consider whether it could be justified under section 1. The Court ruled the infringement was not justified. \n\nWhile the government had a sufficient objective for infringing the right, namely working with the US cooperatively to fight crime and to keep good relations with the US, it was not necessary to risk execution for these objectives to be met. Asking that the death penalty should not be sought should not hurt relations with the US because the extradition treaty allows for this. There was also a concern about keeping dangerous criminals out of Canada, but the Court replied that criminals might not find extradition with the risk of a life sentence more attractive than the risk of execution, and thus it was not proven criminals would flee to Canada.\n\nIn March 2001, less than a month after the ruling, Burns and Rafay were extradited to the United States with assurances from prosecutors handling the case that they would not seek the death penalty. During the trial in 2004 (it was delayed by a number of factors), prosecutors claimed that Burns and Rafay plotted to kill Rafay's family and share the money from an insurance policy and the sale of the family home. Burns claimed that his confession to undercover RCMP officers that he and Rafay killed Rafay's family was the result of coercion by the police. Defense lawyers noted that no forensic evidence linked the two men to the crime.\n\nIn May 2004, both men were found guilty of three counts of murder and each was subsequently sentenced to three consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole.\n\nBurns's family immediately began to fight to have the case overturned on appeal, alleging numerous problems with the investigation and improper rulings by the judge. In 2007, Sebastian Burns's sister Tiffany produced a documentary about coercion by police. The family is continuing its efforts, and a website has been posted that claims to debunk the entire case.\n\nIn July 2014, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled to limit the admissibility of evidence obtained in the sort of RCMP Mr. Big undercover operations that were used to obtain confessions from Burns and Rafay. \n\nThis ruling states that the admissibility of such evidence may be limited in cases of very young or vulnerable suspects. Burns and Rafay were among the youngest suspects ever targeted in an RCMP undercover operation. In late 2014, both men filed paperwork to seek an appeal in light of the 2014 Supreme Court of Canada decision. The murder was the subject of two episodes of the 2017 Netflix documentary-series \"The Confession Tapes\" and True Crime Garage podcasts.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37827991", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37827991", "title": "White Turks", "text": "White Turks\n\nWhite Turks () is a term used in Turkey for the urban population that embraces progressive, secular, Western, Republican values. White Turks are in contrast to the so-called Black Turks (Turkish: \"Kara Türkler\" or \"Siyah Türkler\"), a name for the conservative, Islamic, and typically less educated among the originally rural Anatolian population. The two terms are related to the emergence of a middle class since the end of the 20th century, and is an expression of elite consciousness and also a contempt for a section of the population which is seen as backwards. Civilizing efforts had been part of the imagination of all Turkish elites since the Tanzimat reforms.\n\nAnand Giridharadas describes the dichotomy between white and black Turks as \"an extraordinary culture war over what it means to be a Turk\":The battle — waged in national politics but also in life’s daily minutiae — has become, literally, black and white. In one corner are “white Turks,” who revere the republic’s founder, Kemal Atatürk, and his mission to remake Turkey in Europe’s image — secular, republican, purged of its Ottoman legacies. In the other corner are “black Turks,” conservative Muslims who, in a mostly Muslim nation, were marginalized for decades, excluded from the Turkish elite — until, in 2003, one of their own became a populist prime minister and began what many black Turks consider a healthy rebalancing and many white Turks, the politics of resentment or, worse, revenge.Tayyip Erdoğan often describes himself as a black Turk. The term was also used by 2018 presidential candidate Muharrem İnce to describe himself, claiming that Erdoğan was no longer a black Turk.\n\nIn an ironic approach to the conceptual pair, Mümin Sekman wrote in his book \"Türk Usulü Başarı\" that, among other things, black Turks listen to Arabesque and folk music, while white Turks prefer western music and Turkish pop; black Turks have arranged marriages, while white Turks choose their own partners; white Turks meet at airports, while black Turks use bus terminals.\n\nErtuğrul Özkök of Hürriyet considers himself a white Turk and generalizes the group as follows: \"They live mainly in coastal regions, are sensitive when it comes to secularism, they drink alcohol, have a high purchasing power, a western lifestyle and the women do not wear hijabs\". He also stated in 2014 that under the current rule of the AKP, white Turks have become the new oppressed group in Turkey after Kurds and Alevis, and that the increasingly marginalized white Turks must \"learn to fight by defending their lifestyles.\"\n\nThese terms are believed to have originally been coined by the late journalist in his 1992 book \"Teksas Malatya\". The term \"white Turks\" was meant to be analogous to the American WASP, and was used to describe an old elite who opposed the then-Prime Minister Turgut Özal because of his Kurdish origin, religiousness and lack of military service. The term was subsequently taken up by sociologist Nilüfer Göle and popularized by Turkish columnists, journalists and political scientists who used it to refer to various social groups in Turkey.\n\nSome observers, such as Ayşe Sözen and Nilüfer Narlı, also note the emergence of a third group of \"Grey Turks\", who are urbanized, well-educated and enjoy western music and films, but are pious Muslims. Some use the term to refer to the aspiring black Turks that climbed the socio-economic ladder during the Turgut Özal era and gained momentum during the AKP's current rule.\n\n\n"}
