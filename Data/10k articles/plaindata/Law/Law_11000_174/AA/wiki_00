It has been called the worst building collapse in the area. Seventy-four people (18 children, 33 men and 23 women) were killed, while more than 100 survived. The search for additional survivors ended on 6 April 2013.\n\nThe building was under construction and did not have an occupancy certificate for its 100 to 150 low- to middle-income residents.\nLiving in the building were the site construction workers and families. It was reported that the building was illegally constructed because standard practices were not followed for safe, lawful construction; land acquisition and resident occupancy.\n\nBy 11 April, a total of 15 suspects were arrested including builders, engineers, municipal officials and other responsible parties. Governmental records indicate that there were two orders to manage the number of illegal buildings in the area: a 2005 Maharashtra state order to use remote sensing and a 2010 Bombay High Court order. There were also complaints made to state and municipal officials.\n\nOn 9 April, a campaign began by the Thane Municipal Corporation to demolish area illegal buildings, focusing first on \"dangerous\" buildings. The forest department said that it will address encroachment of forest land in the Thane district. A call centre was established by the Thane Municipal Corporation to accept and track resolution of caller complaints about illegal buildings.\n\nAt 6:30 pm IST (13:00 UTC) on 4 April 2013, a building collapsed in the Shil Phata area of Mumbra, a suburb of Thane in Maharashtra, India. The building collapsed quickly. First, a section of the building collapsed, it tilted, and then the entire building was brought down. A witness described the event, \"The building collapsed like a pack of cards within three to four seconds.\"\n\nAccording to Hasina Shaikh, a school girl who lived on the fifth floor with her family: \"I had just returned from school and was changing when the building started shaking and came down on us... When I regained consciousness later, I was in the hospital.\" She says she considers herself lucky to be alive. One survivor is a 10-month-old girl whose parents had not been found as of 6 April 2013. Reuters reported the last survivor was rescued on 5 April, a woman who was \"found after workers heard her voice and used camera equipment to pinpoint her location under the rubble.\"\n\nDubbed the \"miracle survivor\", a four-year-old girl, Sandhya Thakur, was pulled from the wreckage. She was unable to open her eyes, but awoke on 7 April 2013 to the awareness that she had suffered a disaster. Her father and six brothers and sisters are missing; Her mother died when the building collapsed. She is physically unharmed, but having a hard time adjusting psychologically.\n\nAccording to Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan, payments of 50,000 will be made to the injured, and a 200,000 payment will be made to the next of kin of the deceased.\n\nThe building containing offices and apartments was under construction for six weeks prior to the disaster, but there are varying reports on the extent of the construction completion. \"The Times of India\" reported that \"Twenty-five tenements on five storeys were complete and the sixth and seventh floors were under construction.\" Although there was no occupancy certificate, the first four storeys of the building were illegally inhabited by site construction workers and families. In addition to families of construction workers, there were also families headed by rickshaw drivers and/or those whose children attended tuition classes in the building. It is believed that the builder wanted the building to be inhabited to prevent it being demolished.\n\nThe developers, who intended to build up to 8 such illegal buildings, intended to sell the apartments for 1,100 to 1,400 per square foot. On average, the apartments were 175 square feet.\n\nThe building had come to the attention of the Municipal Commissioner RA Rajeevsaid because the building was said to be built illegally on forest land. Research into the collapsed building's land ownership has determined that it was owned by a tribal family, and the adjoining lot was owned by the forest department.\n\nAlthough this property was not located on forest land, R.K. Pol, Chief Conservator of Forests, has said that the forest department will address encroachment issues in the Thane district from Jawahar-Mokhada to Alibaug.\n\nThe rescue efforts were supervised by District Collector P. Velarasu and Municipal Commissioner R.A. Rajeev, and the rescue was conducted by incident medical teams and fire tenders. A number of local hospitals treated the injured. The most critically injured people were sent to Sion and JJ Hospitals. Moderate injuries were treated at Thane Civil Hospital and Kalwa's Kalsekar and CSM Civic hospitals. As of 6 April 2013, 36 injured people were still receiving treatment.\n\nWorkers, including the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), used bulldozers, hydraulic jacks, power saws and sledgehammers to break through the \"mound of steel and concrete\" and dug an additional below ground. The rescue effort was complicated by the way in which the floors were \"sandwiched\" in the collapse, making it difficult to find individuals in the rubble.\n\nThe rescue effort ended on 6 April. According to NDRF spokesperson R.S. Rajesh: \"We have dug beyond the basement level, and everything is now cleared; there's nothing left.\"\n\nThe building collapse appeared to be the result of poor-quality building material and having been \"weakly built\", according to Police inspector Digamber Jangale and Police commissioner K.P. Raghuvanshi. Lawful building construction in Thane district requires blueprints to be filed and approved by municipal agencies and permits obtained to connect electricity, water and sewage services. The builders did not file the blueprints in this case.\n\nThe police registered a claim of \"culpable homicide\" and on 6 April 2013 arrested the builders.\n\nBy 12 April 2013 Hadisulla Rakbulla Choudhary, a partner of the developer, was arrested for his role.\n\nRamesh Patil, a legislator of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) party, stated that the week before the incident he had complained the building was unfit and not legal. He wrote and sent photographs of this and other buildings to the Thane Municipal Commissioner R.A. Rajeev, Chief Secretary Jayanthkumar Banthia, and the Chief Minister. However, nothing was done.\n\nAt a state assembly meeting, Chief Minister of Maharashtra Prithviraj Chavan assured participants that there would be a thorough investigation of the circumstances leading up to the collapse of the building. Two individuals were suspended from duty: Senior Police Inspector K.P. Naik for collusion and the Deputy Commissioner of Thane, Deepak Chavan, for dereliction of duty.\n\nPratap Sarnaik, Member of the Legislative Assembly, demanded an investigation into the role of R.A. Rajeev, the Thane Municipal Commissioner.\n\nThe prevalence of illegal housing in India is due to a lack of housing coupled with high population growth, and illegal buildings are attractive to lower-income people because of the low housing costs. Many people moved to the greater Mumbai area in search of jobs, and without affordable housing, thousands sleep in slums or on the streets. The Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation reports that there are approximately 19 million families with inadequate housing. To meet the demands, there are many buildings constructed illegally. Further, some builders do not follow proper building practices and laws, or execute proper safety measures. Poor construction materials are also to blame in these circumstances. Within the Mumbai region there are estimated to be hundreds of illegal structures. Sameer Hashmi, a BBC reporter, says that activists \"allege that unscrupulous builders often pay hefty bribes to authorities who turn a blind eye to these illegal structures and do not take any action against the builders.\"\n\nRT reports that: \"...incidents of this kind are not rare in India, where builders often care more for cutting construction expenses than for the security and quality of the work being done.\" This trend has been observed in other municipalities within Mumbai Metropolitan Development Authority in the Navi Mumbai Municipal Cooperation (NMMC) of Nationalist Congress Party, Vasai-Virar sector, and Ulhasnagar.\n\nIn 2010, the government of Maharashtra reported that there were about 500,000 illegal buildings within the Thane district.\n\nIn February 2013, Sunil Kumar Lahoria, a Navi Mumbai developer, was killed after having lodged complaints about 600 area illegal buildings. His son, Sandeep Kumar, said: \"My father paid a very heavy price for exposing irregularities that took place with the active involvement of government officers. He made use of the Right to Information Act to deal with corruption, but he was killed.\" Forest department officials say that during drives to resolve encroachments and to raze Mumbra-Diva area illegal buildings on forest land, their staff received threats against their lives and threats that women in their families would be raped. A Member of the Legislative Assembly, Jitendra Awhad, and his supporters were said to be the source of these threats. According to Awhad, the threats are \"blown out of proportion\".\n\nIn December 2012 Legislator Pratap Sarnaik obtained information, in accordance with the Right to Information Act, about the scope of the construction of illegal buildings in the Thane district. The following was reported in \"The Hindu\" for Thane's divisions:\nFor the nine divisions under the corporation last year, 505 illegal buildings were demolished, there was action against 829 (which does not mean they were demolished), and in December, 2012 alone, 104 illegal constructions were detected. The year round 146 buildings were given notices, and 53 cases of violations were filed under the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act and 83 cases registered under the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation Act.\n\n\"The Hindu\" reported: \"while the TMC says illegal buildings were demolished or given stop work notices, in reality nothing happens. The buildings were rarely brought down and people continued to live there.\"\n\nThe total number of illegal structures are estimated to be about 490,000 in the Thane district according to information in the Bombay (Mumbai) High Court. The structures include slums, shops, chawls and other buildings. Although the court ordered demolition of all such buildings in 2010, the government's response was that no illegal structures built before 2001 would be demolished and no action was taken in response to this judgement.\n\nAccording to Raju Phanse, Right to Information (RTI) activist and General Secretary of the Dharmarajya Paksha political party, Thane Municipal Corporation did not act upon the 2005 Maharashtra state resolution to identify illegal buildings. The order called for municipalities to use remote sensing technology to identify illegal buildings by 28 February 2005 and monitor satellite images every six months. R.A. Rajeev, Thane Municipal Commissioner, said that \"we are doing what we can\"; he admitted that 90% of Mumbra's buildings are illegal.\n\nAs of 9 April 13 people were arrested. Information from interrogation of the two builders, and documents found in one of the builder's homes, led to the arrest of the others in this case. Except for the engineers charged with dereliction of duty, the suspects are charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder and criminal conspiracy. They could be sentenced up to life if convicted.\n\nThis chart was created based upon the builders, police and municipal suspects' alleged roles as identified in an article by the \"Pune Mirror\".\n\nIn addition, TMC engineers Subash Rawal and Ramesh Inamdar allegedly received bribes so that they would not demolish the building.\n\nThe local court on 18 May 2013 granted bail to Afroz Ansari who had supplied materials and Ramdas Burud, a driver to one of the accused officials of TMC. Judge KR Warrier granted bail to them against personal bonds of Rs 15,000. The court on 17 May 2013, rejected the bail pleas of Deputy Municipal Commissioners Deepak Chavan, Shreekant Sarmokdam and Assistant Municipal Commissioner Shyam Thorbole and engineer Ramesh Inamdar.\n\nA formal campaign to demolish area illegal buildings began on 9 April 2013 and is expected to be conducted before the monsoon season. It will be led by Anil Patil, Senior Engineer. The first phase of a \"demolition drive\" begins as 57 illegal buildings in the district (including Mumbra-Kausa area) are vacated, taken over by the Thane Municipal Council (TMC) and demolished. To support the effort, 15 additional officials will be added to the demolition cell and 9 legal advisors will be added to address legal matters. The police are engaged to facilitate evictions.\n\nThe demolition effort will focus first on the most dangerous buildings. Other buildings at the Lucky compound have been razed as part of this initiative.\n\nFurther, the TMC intends to have sewer, water, and electricity service disconnected at all illegal buildings in the district. Water and sewer should be able to be turned off immediately; TMC is requesting that electricity is turned off by the electric service.\n\nThe Thane Municipal Corporation established a call centre to receive complaints about illegal buildings on 10 April 2013. Its responsibilities include: notifying municipal officials of the complaints, tabulating information about actions taken and preparing reports of complaints and activities for the Municipal Commissioner. It is a 24 hours a day operation.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1430224", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1430224", "title": "Bayh–Dole Act", "text": "Bayh–Dole Act\n\nThe Bayh–Dole Act or Patent and Trademark Law Amendments Act (Pub. L. 96-517, December 12, 1980) is United States legislation dealing with intellectual property arising from federal government-funded research. Sponsored by two senators, Birch Bayh of Indiana and Bob Dole of Kansas, the Act was adopted in 1980, is codified at 94 Stat. 3015, and in 35 U.S.C. § 200–212, and is implemented by 37 C.F.R. 401.\n\nThe key change made by Bayh–Dole was in ownership of inventions made with federal funding. Before the Bayh–Dole Act, federal research funding contracts and grants obligated inventors (wherever they worked) to assign inventions they made using federal funding to the federal government. Bayh–Dole permits a university, small business, or non-profit institution to elect to pursue ownership of an invention in preference to the government.\n\nThe Bayh–Dole Act grew out of the Congress's efforts to respond to the economic malaise of the 1970s. One of Congress's efforts was focused on how best to manage inventions that were created with the more than $75 billion a year invested in government sponsored R&D. Three philosophies were debated: \"a Hamiltonian belief that the solution lay with a strong central government, which should take charge and actively manage these resources\"; \"a Jeffersonian belief that the solution lay with the individual and that the best thing government could do to provide incentives for success was to get out of the way of these individuals\"; and a belief that \"held that government could only hurt and that it should make sure that everyone benefited financially from government's efforts\".\n\nPrior to the enactment of Bayh-Dole, the U.S. government had accumulated 28,000 patents, but fewer than 5% of those patents were commercially licensed.\n\nThese patents had accumulated because after World War II, the government under President Harry S. Truman decided to continue and even ramp up its spending on research and development, on the basis of Vannevar Bush's famous report entitled, \"Science The Endless Frontier\", which stated: \"Scientific progress is one essential key to our security as a nation, to our better health, to more jobs, to a higher standard of living, and to our cultural progress.\" However, the government did not have a unified patent policy governing all the agencies that funded research, and the general policy was that government would retain title to inventions and would license them only nonexclusively. \"Those seeking to use government-owned technology found a maze of rules and regulations set out by the agencies in question because there was no uniform federal policy on patents for government-sponsored inventions or on the transfer of technology from the government to the private sector.\"\n\nIn 1968 the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) introduced a uniform \"Institutional Patent Agreement\" to allow grantee nonprofit institutions to obtain assignment of patentable inventions made with federal funding for which the institution had decided to seek patents. By 1980, over seventy universities and research organizations had negotiated an IPA with HEW or with the National Science Foundation. In the 1970s, faculty at Purdue University in Indiana had made important discoveries under grants from the Department of Energy, which did not issue Institutional Patent Agreements. Officials at the university complained to their Senator, Birch Bayh, whose staff investigated. At the same time, Senator Robert Dole was made aware of similar issues, and the two senators agreed to collaborate on a bill, along the lines of the \"Jeffersonian belief\" described above.\n\nAccordingly, as described below, the legislation decentralized control of federally funded inventions, vesting the responsibility and authority to commercialize inventions with the institution or company receiving a grant, with certain responsibilities to the government, the inventor, and the public, as described below.\n\nThe Bayh–Dole Act authorizes the Department of Commerce to create standard patent rights clauses to be included in federal funding agreements with nonprofits, including universities, and small businesses. The standard patent rights clause is set forth at 37 CFR 401.14(a). The clause is incorporated into federal funding agreements through a number of contracting instruments, including grants made to universities and contracts made with for-profit companies.\n\nUnder the standard patent rights clause, small businesses and non-profit organizations, if they obtain title by assignment to \"subject inventions,\" can retain that title by complying with certain formalities. No small business or nonprofit organization, however, is required to obtain ownership of such inventions. All organizations agree to do the following:\n\n\nIf an organization does not elect to retain title, then control of the invention passes to the Federal agency. The agency may waive its right to take title to the invention, and allow the inventors to retain title to their inventions.\n\nIf an organization elects to retain title to a subject invention for which it has obtained assignment, the organization is obligated to do the following:\n\nCertain additional requirements apply to nonprofit organizations only. Nonprofits must also:\n\nA subject invention is defined as \"any invention of the contractor that is conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work under a funding agreement.\"\n\nThe CFR addresses the relationship between federal funding and other funding that may supplement the federally supported research. If an invention is made outside the research activities of the federally funded research \"without interference with or cost to the government-funded project,\" then the invention is not a subject invention. Similarly, an invention is not a subject invention if it arises in closely related research outside the \"planned and committed activities\" of the federally funded project, and the closely related research does not \"diminish or distract from the performance\" of the federally funded project.\n\nThere is a growing body of case law on Bayh-Dole.\n\nStanford v. Roche, was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States that held that title in a patented invention vests first in the inventor, even if the inventor is a researcher at a federally funded lab subject to the Bayh–Dole Act. The judges affirmed the common understanding of US Constitutional law that inventors automatically own their inventions, and contractual obligations to assign those rights to third parties are secondary.\n\nThe case arose because a Stanford employee, who was under obligation to assign inventions to Stanford, spent time at a biotech company to learn a technique, and signed an agreement with that company agreeing to assign inventions to it. The company was later purchased by Roche. Stanford filed patents on work the employee did after returning to Stanford, and the company (and later Roche) introduced products based on the work the Stanford employee did at the company. When Stanford sued Roche for infringing its patents, Roche countered that it had an ownership interest in the patents due to the agreement that the Stanford employee had signed. Among the arguments Stanford made at the District, Federal Circuit, and Supreme Court levels, was one that stated that the Bayh–Dole Act gave grant recipients a \"right of second refusal\" subject to the Government's right of first refusal, based on the following language of the statute: \"If a contractor does not elect to retain title to a subject invention in cases subject to this section, the Federal agency may consider and after consultation with the contractor grant requests for retention of rights by the inventor subject to the provisions of this Act and regulations promulgated hereunder.\"\n\nWhile the District court accepted that argument, both the Federal Circuit and the Supreme Court denied it, leaving the basic law of inventorship unchanged.\n\nOnly one case has discussed the implications of disclosing subject inventions. In \"Campbell Plastics Engineering & Mfg., Inc. v. Les Brownlee\", 389 F.3d 1243 (Fed. Cir. 2004), the court held that since the appellant failed to comply with the invention disclosure provisions of a contract, the court upheld the transfer of title to an invention to the U.S. Army. Specifically, the contract required, per Bayh-Dole, that an invention be disclosed to the U.S. Army through a specific form, DD Form 882s. Campbell Plastics never disclosed its subject invention through this form. Campbell Plastics argued instead that it disclosed all parts of its invention over the course of the contract, but simply never used the form. The court did not specifically address the legitimacy of the particular form, but assumed that it was sufficient. Nevertheless, the court found that the \"piecemeal submissions [did] not adequately disclose the subject invention under the contract.\" The result was a forfeiture of the subject invention.\n\nIn a footnote in a famous experimental use case, \"Madey v. Duke University\", 307 F.3d 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2002), the court briefly mentions Bayh-Dole in suggesting that experimental uses by researchers are supported under the law. Specifically, the \"Madey\" court quoted the district court as holding that where a subject invention exists and the defendant is a recipient of government funding, \"in light of the Bayh-Dole Act ... use of the patents that has been authorized by the government does not constitute patent infringement.\"\n\nIn \"University of Rochester v. G.D. Searle & Co.\", 358 F.3d 916 (Fed. Cir. 2004), the court rejected a claim that Bayh-Dole altered the grounds for patentability. The court, quoting an Amicus curiæ, stated\n\nno connection exists between the Bayh-Dole Act and the legal standards that courts employ to assess patentability. Furthermore, none of the eight policy objectives of the Bayh-Dole Act encourages or condones less stringent application of the patent laws to universities than to other entities.\n\nThe government's march-in right is one of the most contentious provisions in Bayh-Dole. It allows the funding agency, on its own initiative or at the request of a third party, to effectively ignore the exclusivity of a patent awarded under the act and grant additional licenses to other \"reasonable applicants.\" This right is strictly limited and can only be exercised if the agency determines, following an investigation, that one of four criteria is met. The most important of these is a failure by the contractor to take \"effective steps to achieve practical application of the subject invention\" or a failure to satisfy \"health and safety needs\" of consumers.\n\nThough this right is, in theory, quite powerful, it has not proven so in terms of its practical application —as of January, 2015, no federal agency has exercised its march-in rights. Five march-in petitions have been made to the National Institutes of Health.\n\nIn \"In Re Petition of CellPro, Inc.\", CellPro petitioned the NIH in March 1997 after five years of patent litigation with The Johns Hopkins University and Baxter Healthcare. CellPro had a patented, FDA-approved device for purifying stem cells for use in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation procedures; Johns Hopkins had patents on a different method to purify stem cells and had licensed them to Becton Dickinson, which had sublicensed them to Baxter, which was developing products but had none on the market. CellPro argued that the march-in provisions were created for this situation, especially because (in its view) availability of essential medical technology was at stake. The NIH denied this claim citing:\n\nIn \"In the Case of NORVIR\", the NIH received requests from Essential Inventions in January 2004, and other members of the public and members of the United States Congress, to exercise march-in rights for patents owned by Abbott Labs covering the drug ritonavir, sold under the trade name Norvir, a prescription drug used in the treatment of AIDS. In 2003 Abbott raised the price of Norvir 400% for U.S. customers (but not for consumers in any other country), and had refused to license ritonavir to another company for purposes for providing protease inhibitors coformulated with ritonavir. The NIH denied the petition finding no grounds to exercise its march-in rights. The NIH cited:\n\nIn \"In the Case of Xalatan\" the NIH received a request from Essential Inventions in January 2004 to adopt a policy of granting march-in licenses to patents when the patent owner charged significantly higher prices in the United States than they did in other high income countries, on the basis of Pfizer's glaucoma drug being sold in the United States at two to five times the prices in other high income countries. The NIH held that \"the extraordinary remedy of march-in was not an appropriate means for controlling prices.\"\n\nIn \"In the Case of Fabrazyme\" patients with Fabry disease petitioned on August 2, 2010, for march-in rights in response to Genzyme's inability to manufacture enough Fabrazyme to treat all Fabry patients. In 2009, Genzyme rationed the drug to less than a third of the recommended dose as a result of manufacturing problems and FDA sanctions, but did not anticipate being able to meet the market needs until late 2011. The patients had a return of their symptoms and were put at greater risk of morbidity and mortality at the reduced dosage. The petitioners contended that where a licensee of a public invention has created a drug shortage, the public health requirements of the Bayh–Dole Act are not met and other manufacturers should be allowed to enter the market.\n\nOn November 3, 2010, the NIH denied the petition for march-in, stating that under the then-current FDA drug approval process, it would take years of clinical testing to bring a biosimilar of Fabrazyme to market and therefore march-in would not address the problem. The NIH also stated that it would continue to monitor the situation and if Genzyme could not meet its production deadlines, or if a third party licensee requested a license, the march-in request would be revisited. The NIH additionally required regular updates from Mount Sinai School of Medicine, the patent holder, which agreed to not seek injunctions for potentially infringing products being sold during the shortage. On February 13, 2013, NIH's Office of Technology Transfer issued a \"close out\" letter stating that: \"The December 2012 report from Genzyme stated that: (1) U.S. Fabry patients remain on full dose regimens, (2) Genzyme continues to accommodate new patients with full dosing and without placing them on a waiting list; and (3) Genzyme is able to provide full doses of Fabrazyme to patients transitioning to Fabrazyme.\n\nOn October 25, 2012 the NIH received a petition on behalf of a coalition of public interest groups to exercise its march-in rights against AbbVie over its antiretroviral drug ritonavir (sold under the name Norvir). On October 25, 2013 NIH denied the petition stating that, as in 2004 when similar pricing and availability issues regarding the same drug were raised and discussed at public hearings, the NIH'S role in the case was limited to compliance with the Bayh-Dole Act and that \"... the extraordinary remedy of march-in is not an appropriate means of controlling prices of drugs broadly available ...\".\n\nDespite an ambiguity noted by commentators as to the effects on the public of a contractor's failure to comply with the requirements of Bayh-Dole, the courts have clarified that any such failure does not in and of itself divest an owner of title or render a patent invalid.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23746278", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23746278", "title": "Blasphemy law in Algeria", "text": "Blasphemy law in Algeria\n\nThe People's Democratic Republic of Algeria prohibits blasphemy against Islam by using legislation rather than by using Sharia. The penalty for blasphemy may be years of imprisonment as well as a fine. Every Algerian child has an opportunity to learn what blasphemy is because Islam is a compulsory subject in public schools, which are regulated jointly by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Religious Affairs.\n\nMore than ninety-nine percent of Algeria's population is Sunni Muslim. The Constitution of Algeria declares that Islam is the state religion but Article 36 of the Constitution provides for freedom of belief. The Constitution does not provide for Sharia courts in Algeria's court system. Article 35 guarantees freedom of conscience and of opinion. Article 41 says all citizens are entitled to the freedom of expression. Algeria has signed and ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).\n\nDespite the provisions of the Constitution, Algeria severely restricts what anyone can say or what anyone can do as a religious practice. The penal code forbids anyone from insulting, or inciting hatred against, anyone who belongs to an ethnic or philosophical group or to a religion. Freedom of speech must be exercised with respect for \"individual dignity, the imperatives of foreign policy, and the national defense.\"\n\nAlgeria uses a 1990 law to protect Islam from defamation, to control access to information from outside the country, and to outlaw writing that threatens national unity. In 2001, the government amended some laws to criminalize writing, cartoons, and speech that insult or offend the president, the parliament, the judiciary, the armed forces, or \"any other authority of public order.\" Those convicted of giving offense face prison sentences that range from three to twenty-four months and fines of 50,000 to 500,000 dinars.\n\nThe Ministry of Religious Affairs (MRA) operates to ban publications and broadcasting that might be blasphemous. At the October 2008 Algiers Book Fair, the MRA banned the sale of 1,471 religious titles. Shortly before the book fair, the government banned the printing of author and vocal government critic Mohamed Benchicou's latest book, \"The Diary of a Free Man\". During the 2007 book fair, government officials confiscated and banned a previous book by Benchicou, \"The Jailhouses of Algiers\". Algeria banned the Arab news network \"Al Jazeera\" in 2004.\n\nThe government monitors e-mail and the Internet for material that is offensive to the authorities. Internet service providers can face criminal penalties for the material and the websites they host. Providers are not permitted to give access to material \"incompatible with morality or public opinion.\"\n\nIn 1991, a war began between the Algerian government and several Islamist groups. Fighters on both sides conducted campaigns of torture and murder that were sometimes indiscriminate and sometimes aimed at the intellectual and educated community. The victims included many teachers, students, journalists, writers, artists, musicians, the defenders of human rights, lawyers, civil servants, and foreigners. Hostilities abated after 2006 but a state of emergency remains in effect.\n\nIn February 2008, authorities arrested Christian converts Yousef Ourahmane, Rachid Seghir (or Esseghir), and Hamid Ramdani for blasphemy and for uttering threats against a man who allegedly converted from Islam to Christianity to Islam. At the trial, which began on 21 October 2008, the prosecutor asked the court for three years imprisonment and a fine of 50,000 dinars for each man. The court acquitted the men on 29 October because the prosecution did not prove that the men had committed a crime.\n\nIn 2008, authorities arrested six residents of the town of Biskra for eating and playing cards during the daylight hours of Ramadan. On 5 October 2008, a judge found all six guilty and fined them 120,000 dinars each ($1,770 US). Six days later an appeals court judge overruled the decision on the ground that the original sentence violated the Constitution. In a separate incident, the Algiers appeals court on 18 November reduced the sentence of three years' imprisonment to two months of time served for three men convicted of smoking during Ramadan.

Chriet and Khatir were the managers of two television channels. The alleged blasphemy was the broadcast of cartoons which were published originally in 2005 in the Danish magazine \"Jyllands-Posten\".

The judge found that Smets, while in jail because of a civil matter, had accidentally dropped a copy of the Quran into water during an argument with other prisoners. Those prisoners had accused Smets of tearing up a Quran but the prosecution did not produce a torn Quran.\n\n"}

It is defined under the Computer Fraud and Abuse act. (U.S.C 18 § 1030)\n\nA computer trespass is defined as accessing a computer without proper authorization and gaining financial information, information from a department or agency of the United States and/or information from any protected computer. Each state has their own laws regarding computer trespassing but they all echo the federal act in some manner\n\nTo be found guilty of computer trespass in New York one must knowingly use a computer, computer service, or computer network without authorization \"and\" commit (or attempt) some further crime.\n\n(A) No person shall knowingly use or operate the property of another without the consent of the owner or person authorized to give consent.\n\n(B) No person, in any manner and by any means, including, but not limited to, computer hacking, shall knowingly gain access to, attempt to gain access to, or cause access to be gained to any computer, computer system, computer network, cable service, cable system, telecommunications device, telecommunications service, or information service without the consent of, or beyond the scope of the express or implied consent of, the owner of the computer, computer system, computer network, cable service, cable system, telecommunications device, telecommunications service, or information service or other person authorized to give consent.\n\nUnder federal law, the punishment for committing a computer trespass is imprisonment for no more than 10 or 20 years, depending on the severity of the crime committed. (subsection (a) (b) (c) (1) (A) (B))\n\nYears after the CFAA was put into law, many have become uncomfortable with the law's language because of the drastic difference between today's technology and the technology of the 1980s. Legal scholars such as Orin Kerr and Tiffany Curtis have expressed such concerns. In one of Curtis's essays, \"COMPUTER FRAUD AND ABUSE ACT ENFORCEMENT: CRUEL, UNUSUAL, AND DUE FOR REFORM.\" She expresses how, with the passage of time, the CFAA becomes a more cruel law with the current language used in the act. She then suggests that the United States Congress should take the act into review and refer it to the Eighth Amendment to update the language to better fit modern law and society. Kerr wrote in his essay, \"Trespass, Not Fraud: The Need for New Sentencing Guidelines in CFAA Cases,\" that since the language is so vague in the act, you could be punished in a way that doesn't reflect the crime you committed. He stresses how the language stresses the financial fraud language more than any other part in the law, leaving the rest vague in meaning. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "3903580", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3903580", "title": "Confrontation Clause", "text": "Confrontation Clause\n\nThe Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that \"in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right…to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\" Generally, the right is to have a face-to-face confrontation with witnesses who are offering testimonial evidence against the accused in the form of cross-examination during a trial. The Fourteenth Amendment makes the right to confrontation applicable to the states and not just the federal government. The right only applies to criminal prosecutions, not civil cases or other proceedings.\n\nThe Confrontation Clause has its roots in both English common law, protecting the right of cross-examination, and Roman law, which guaranteed persons accused of a crime the right to look their accusers in the eye. In noting the right's long history, the United States Supreme Court has cited Acts of the Apostles 25:16, which reports the Roman governor Porcius Festus, discussing the proper treatment of his prisoner Paul: \"It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man up to die before the accused has met his accusers face-to-face, and has been given a chance to defend himself against the charges.\" It is also cited in Shakespeare's \"Richard II\", Blackstone's treatises, and statutes.\n\nIn 2004, in \"Crawford v. Washington\", the Supreme Court of the United States significantly redefined the application of the right to confrontation. In \"Crawford\", the Supreme Court changed the inquiry from whether the evidence offered had an \"indicia of reliability\" to whether the evidence is testimonial hearsay. The shift was from a substantive and subjective inquiry into the reliability of the evidence, to a procedural question of whether the defendant had been afforded the right to confront her or his accuser. The Court implicitly noted the shift, \"Dispensing with confrontation because testimony is obviously reliable is akin to dispensing with jury trial because the defendant is obviously guilty.\"\n\nThe \"Crawford\" Court decided the key was whether the evidence was testimonial because of the Sixth Amendment's use of the word \"witness.\" Quoting the dictionary, the Court explained that a witness is one who \"bear[s] testimony\" and that \"testimony\" refers to a \"solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing some fact.\"\n\nNonetheless, in \"Crawford,\" the Supreme Court explicitly declined to provide a \"comprehensive\" definition of \"testimonial\" evidence (and, thus evidence subject to the requirements of the Confrontation Clause). In \"Davis v. Washington\" and its companion case, \"Hammon v. Indiana\", the Court undertook exactly this task. The Court explained what constitutes testimonial hearsay:\n\nThe \"Davis\" Court noted several factors that, objectively considered, help determine whether a statement is testimonial: 1) whether the statement describes past events or events as they are happening, 2) whether the purpose of the statement is to assist in investigation of a crime or, on the other hand, provide information relevant to some other purpose, 3) the level of formality of the exchange in which the statement is made. The court noted that a single conversation with, for example, a 911 operator may contain both statements that are intended to address an ongoing emergency and statements that are for the purpose of assisting police investigation of a crime. The latter are testimonial statements because they are the sort of statements that an objectively reasonable person, listening to the statements, would expect to be used in an investigation or prosecution.\n\nThe \"Crawford\" decision left the other basic components of the Confrontation Clause's applicability—the witness's availability and the scope of the cross examination—unchanged.\n\nIf a statement is testimonial, the person making the statement must generally be available for cross examination. An exception to this rule is if the witness is unavailable. But even where the witness is unavailable, the defendant must have had a prior opportunity to confront the witness through cross examination. The latter requirement, cross examination, is discussed below.\n\nA witness may be unavailable for a variety of reasons. A common reason for a witness to be unavailable is that the witness is claiming a Fifth Amendment privilege against self incrimination. Other privileges are also a source of unavailability. Witnesses may also be unavailable because they have died, had memory loss, or simply decided not to cooperate as a witness against the defendant. \n\nThe obvious may also occur, a witness may be intimidated, seriously injured, or murdered, and his prior statements then are usually not admissible even if it appears the defendant caused the nonappearance. The federal witness protection program was developed because of the difficulty of prosecuting cases where witnesses would disappear shortly before trial. These programs frequently require the witness to leave his residence or even family so that he can be protected before the trial occurs.\n\nEven where the witness is unavailable, the defendant usually has a right to cross-examine the witness. An exception to this rule, forfeiture by wrongdoing, is discussed below.\n\nThe more obvious violations of the right to cross-examine witnesses are those where the defendant has never had the opportunity to cross-examine the witness at all, in any setting, or on any subject. The closer cases are those where some cross-examination has occurred, either at trial or prior to trial.\n\nGenerally, having the opportunity to cross-examine a witness at trial will satisfy the Confrontation Clause's guarantee. And trial courts are given \"broad discretion . . . to preclude repetitive and unduly harassing interrogation.\" The Supreme Court has emphasized that the \"Confrontation Clause guarantees an \"opportunity\" for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defendant might wish. Nonetheless, a trial court cannot preclude cross-examination on some subjects. Besides the subject matter of the case, the crime for which a defendant is charged, a defendant has the right to attack the credibility or impeach the testimony of the witness. Despite trial courts' \"broad discretion\", it is an error to limit defendants from cross-examining witnesses on an area that would expose a \"prototypical form of bias\" that would be relevant to the jury's assessment of that witness's credibility. Examples of such biases include being on probation as a juvenile delinquent, even where the state normally considers such a status to be protected confidential information; having charges dropped in exchange for testimony, despite a specific denial that dropping the charges had any effect on the testimony; and shared allegiances of the victim and witness, including gang membership.\n\nIn \"Crawford\", the Supreme Court noted that two exceptions to the common law right of confrontation were acknowledged at the time the constitution was written: forfeiture by wrongdoing and dying declarations. Only the former has been explicitly adopted by the Court.\n\nWhere the defendant makes the witness unavailable for the purpose of preventing the witness from testifying, the defendant forfeits the right to confront the witness. This exception only applies to circumstances where the defendant acts with the purpose of preventing the testimony, but not to other circumstances where the defendant may nonetheless be blameworthy. For example, the testimonial statements of an uncross-examined murder victim are not admissible against the person who committed the murder unless the murder was committed for the purpose of preventing the victim from testifying.\n\nIt is the prosecution's burden to prove, by a preponderance of evidence, that the defendant secured the witness's unavailability for the purpose of preventing the witness to testify.\n\nDying declarations, although noted by the \"Crawford\" Court as a historic exception to the common law right of confrontation, have not yet been explicitly acknowledged by the Court as an exception to the Confrontation Clause right. Lower courts have recognized the exception, but during oral argument in \"Michigan v. Bryant\", the Court discussed the exception at length and frequently implied that the exception might apply, as it had done in \"Crawford\" and \"Giles\".\n\nConfrontation Clause violations are usually subject to harmless error review . This means that even if evidence has been admitted in violation of the Confrontation Clause, a defendant is not entitled to a new trial if the reviewing court is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the inadmissible evidence did not contribute to the verdict. Harmless error is not a standard of review, and is an analysis for whether the error might have affected the jury's decision.\n\nWhere a defendant fails to object to the inadmissible evidence at the time of trial or fails to specify that she or he is objecting on Confrontation Clause grounds, the reviewing court will sometimes only review for more substantial errors such as \"plain error\" or an error that results in a manifest injustice . Federal Circuit Courts of Appeal review unobjected to Confrontation Clause errors for plain error . State courts vary widely in their requirements for reviewing Confrontation Clause errors, but many review for either plain error, manifest injustice, or another similar standard. In many instances, courts reverse on Confrontation Clause grounds without analyzing whether an error is harmless. The most common reason for omitting such an analysis is the government's failure to raise harmlessness as an issue. Generally, defendants do not raise harmlessness unless the government does so.\n\nThe states are free to interpret similar clauses in state constitutions more strictly than the Supreme Court's interpretation of the federal Confrontation Clause.\n\nBecause many jurisdictions, including the federal courts and a number of states, practice constitutional abstention many cases that include Confrontation Clause violations are decided on other grounds. Constitutional abstention is a judicial preference to resolve dispositive non-constitutional issues first, and only turning to constitutional issues if they are necessary to resolve the case. In Confrontation Clause cases, constitutional abstention most typically occurs where the court resolves a hearsay issue based on the relevant evidence code before turning to the Confrontation Clause analysis. Thus, a preference for interpreting other closely related laws first often leaves Confrontation Clause issues unaddressed.\n\nThe Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments also require confrontation as an element of due process. State statutes and constitutions are another source of the right to confront witnesses.\n\n"}

The core group consists of employees engaged in clerical work, trade (for example, shop assistants), inventory processing, technical or clinical work (for example, engineers, nurses and doctors), management, etc. However, executives who are not subject to supervision, for example, CEOs, are not covered by the law.\n\nIn principle, the Act is not applicable to employees engaged in craft or factory work, agriculture, fishery, waiting tables, kitchen work, etc. However, although many sectors of employment are not immediately subject to the law, the law nonetheless applies to a portion of such sectors through employment contracts or agreements which provide that the law is to apply (for example, auxiliary nurses, educators, social and health care assistants, and Folkeskole teachers). In Denmark, these are sometimes referred to as \"aftalefunktionærer\" (contract salaried employees) as opposed to \"lovfunktionærer\" (legal salaried employees), to whom the law automatically applies.

Fowler\n\nHendrix Marion Fowler Sr., known as Mutt Fowler (February 13, 1918 – September 16, 2014), was a politician and businessman who served from 1953 to 1972 as mayor of the small town of Coushatta in Red River Parish in northwestern Louisiana, as a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives from 1972 to 1986, and later as the executive director of the Sabine River Authority.\n\nFowler's public career ended in indictment and a plea bargain for the circumvention of state bid laws and dissatisfaction over his having allocated scarce public monies on low-priority projects. He eventually served forty-five days in the Sabine Parish jail. Fowler was the third member of a Democratic political dynasty that also included two Louisiana state elections commissioners, the second of whom was indicted, convicted, and imprisoned for bribery and income tax evasion.\n\nFowler was born to Angus Jesse Fowler and the former Zula Fair in the Holly Springs community near Coushatta, a parish seat of 1,964 residents (2010 census) located forty miles south of Shreveport. He had two brothers and two sisters. His older brother, Douglas Fowler, was elected three times as the Red River Parish clerk of court (1940–1952) and later served two years as Coushatta's mayor from 1952 to 1954. Douglas Fowler was elected as \"custodian of voting machines\" in the 1959-1960 Louisiana state election cycle and served until December 31, 1979, when ill health forced him to retire. His title had been changed under a new state constitution to \"elections commissioner\" effective with his last term, which began in 1976.\n\nDouglas Fowler was succeeded as elections commissioner by his younger son, H. M.'s nephew, Jerry Marston Fowler, who, like his father, was elected five times. Jerry Fowler lost the nonpartisan blanket primary with a third-place finish, amid allegations of impropriety which surfaced in the campaign. Suzanne Haik Terrell then defeated fellow Republican Woody Jenkins in November 1999, to claim the position. Jerry Fowler was thereafter indicted, convicted, and imprisoned for bribery and income tax evasion in connection with his official duties. Nevertheless, both Fowlers served in the elections position for a combination of just over four decades.\n\nThe youngest of the three Fowler brothers, \"Mutt\" graduated in 1937 from the former Martin High School in the Martin community in Red River Parish and attended Northwestern State University in nearby Natchitoches, Louisiana. He left college in March 1941 to enter the United States Army. With service during World War II, he attained the rank of sergeant and was assigned to a special group of soldiers to establish convalescent hospitals for injured military personnel on Army bases in five states. Fowler received orders to head to the Pacific Theater of Operations, but they were soon cancelled because of the historic \"Enola Gay\" atomic bomb flight over Hiroshima, Japan.\n\nFowler worked for his brother, John R. Fowler (1912-1990), in the latter's drug store in Coushatta but subsequently in 1956 became an insurance agent. He turned over the insurance firm in 1982 to his son, H. M. \"Buddy\" Fowler Jr. (born December 6, 1943). He delivered papers for \"The Shreveport Times\" and was the Red River Parish agent for the Shreveport Production Credit Association. Fowler in 1953 became mayor of Coushatta to succeed his brother, Douglas, and served for nineteen years. In the 1971-1972 election cycle, he was elected to the legislature, in which he remained for fourteen years. In his last election in 1983, he defeated two intraparty rivals, \"Dickie\" Alexander and Ray Dyess. Fowler resigned from the House on April 1, 1986, to become executive director of the Sabine River Authority, a port commission on the Louisiana-Texas border governed by an 11-member board based in Many in Sabine Parish in western Louisiana.\n\nWithin two years, the Authority dismissed Fowler from his position amid allegations of hiring friends and relatives, including his son. Fowler was accused of spending the limited funds of the Authority on questionable undertakings, rather than access roads and boat lanes. He was also accused of circumventing state bid laws. The Authority announced on March 10, 1989, that Fowler's two-year contract would not be renewed and that he would be replaced by William Kratz, a then 66-year-old university mathematics instructor. Fowler's salary continued through March 31, 1989, when his three-year contract lapsed. Robert Gentry, then chairman of the Sabine River Authority's committee which screened the applications for general manager, said that Fowler had lost the confidence of the board. Katherine Fowler became so irate over the developments that she declared the allegations against her husband \"all lies.\"\n\nMonths passed, and an intensive investigation began. In late 1990, the State of Louisiana announced that it would seek indictments against Fowler, his son, and Ottis Lewing (born 1935), a Many contractor. Lewing later admitted to bid rigging. \"Mutt\" Fowler was accused of two counts of forgery and one count of splitting profits, fees, and commissions. \"Buddy\" Fowler was similarly charged with a single violation of splitting profits, fees, and commissions.\n\nIn March 1991, Fowler pleaded not guilty to the charges. In mid-October 1992, however, he made a plea bargain with the state in exchange for the dropping of the single charge against his son. He faced a maximum $1,000 fine, six months imprisonment, and $5,000 in reimbursement to the Sabine River Authority. Ultimately, Fowler served ninety days, with two years probation, $2,500 in restitution, and one thousand hours of community service. The ninety days was cut in half because of labor performed while incarcerated.\n\nFowler was a member of the Coushatta First United Methodist Church. He was married for sixty-six years to the former Katherine Posey (March 25, 1917 – September 30, 2007). Their daughter was Katherine Ann \"Kathy\" Fowler (March 29, 1946 – April 24, 2006).\n\nFowler died in September 2014 at the age of ninety-six. Except for his grandson, H. M. Fowler III (who is buried at Wesley Chapel Cemetery in Red River Parish), the family is interred at Springville Cemetery just off U.S. Highway 71 in Coushatta.\n"}

The governing agency is a seven-member Board of Trustees consisting of three judges of the Fourth Judicial District, three practicing attorneys, and a member of the Hennepin County Board of Commissioners. The library, which is open to the public, is funded by a combination of court fees, user fees, and an appropriation from the Hennepin County general revenue fund.\n\nThe Hennepin County Law Library had its origin when the Minneapolis Bar Association incorporated on February 20, 1883. The Bar Association was a stock corporation that allowed members to pay for stock by contributing books, the value of which was determined by an appraisal committee. The law library's first location was a room on the second floor of a building on Nicollet Avenue adjoining the First National Bank at Washington Avenue. In August 1883 the collection was moved to the Academy of Music Building, at the corner of Washington and Hennepin Avenues. This magnificent building, a showplace for the arts and the center of the city's entertainment district, was gutted by fire on Christmas Day, 1884. The law library was completely destroyed. With the insurance proceeds of $15,000, the Bar Association began rebuilding the law library, which opened in the Boston Block on May 1, 1885. This was another famous building that boasted the first indoor court in Minneapolis. But in April 1886, it was also struck by fire, destroying the law library for a second time. With the insurance of $20,000, a third law library was established in the Temple Court building, which occupied the site of the former Academy of Music Building. By 1895 the law library contained about 7,000 volumes. In 1903 it was provided accommodations in Room 434 of the new Court House and City Hall building. In 1960 the law library moved to Room 318, where it remained until its move in September 1976 to its present location in the Hennepin County Government Center. \n\nThe law library is named for Anne W. Grande, who served as law librarian for 33 years, from 1975-2008.\n\nThe law library was renovated in the summer of 2016.\n\nAccording to a 1941 Hennepin Lawyer article by Thomas Kneeland, one of the incorporators of the Minneapolis Bar Association, the Bar Association employed three librarians during the time it owned the law library. Kneeland listed the first as Edward S. Waters, though a newspaper article on December 26, 1884 in the Minneapolis Evening Journal stated that F. S. Gaylord was the librarian at the time of the Christmas Day fire. The History of the Bench and Bar of Minnesota, by Hiram F. Stevens (Minneapolis: Legal Publishing and Engraving Co., 1904) lists E.S. Waters as Treasurer of the Minneapolis Bar Association in 1904. Kneeland listed the second librarian as Frederic Klapp, who was succeeded in 1921 by his son, S. D. Kapp, who served until his death in 1937. Hennepin County law librarians include Lillian W. Taylor (1937-1944), Buelah C. Blaisdell (1944-1948), Ethel Kommes (1948-1975), Anne Grande (1975-2008), Ed Carroll (2008–2015), Karen Westwood (2015-current).\n\n"}

Cir. 2014), is a 2014 decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit rejecting a patent for a cloned sheep known as \"Dolly the Sheep\"— the first mammal ever cloned from an adult somatic cell.\n\nDolly was cloned in 1996 by Ian Wilmut, Keith Campbell and colleagues at the Roslin Institute, part of the University of Edinburgh Scotland. BBC News and Scientific American called Dolly \"the world's most famous sheep,\" The cloning method Campbell and Wilmut used to create Dolly constituted a breakthrough in scientific discovery. Known as somatic cell nuclear transfer, this process involves removing the nucleus of a regular body cell and implanting that nucleus into an egg cell that has had its cell nucleus removed. A nucleus is the organelle that holds a cell's genetic material (its DNA). Campbell and Wilmut found that if the donor, somatic cell is arrested in the stage of the cell cycle where it is dormant and non-replicating (the quiescent phase) prior to nuclear transfer, the resulting fused cell will develop into an embryo. The resulting cloned animal is an exact genetic replica of the adult mammal from which the somatic cell nucleus was taken.\n\nThe patent application claims the cloned animal. Claim 155 is representative:\n\nThe Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) rejected the claims as patent ineligible under 35 U.S.C. § 101 \"because it constituted a natural phenomenon that did not possess 'markedly different characteristics than any found in nature.' \" A patent on the method was allowed, but it is not involved in this case.\n\nThe Federal Circuit unanimously affirmed the PTO rejection of the claims in opinion by Judge Timothy Dyk joined by Judges Kimberly Ann Moore and Eli Wallach.\n\nIt is \"clear that naturally occurring organisms are not patentable.\" The patent in \"Chakrabarty\" claimed a genetically engineered bacterium that was capable of breaking down various components of crude oil. The patent applicant created this non-naturally occurring bacterium by adding four plasmids to a specific strain of bacteria. The Court held that the modified bacterium was patentable because it was \"new\" with \"markedly different characteristics from any found in nature and one having the potential for significant utility.\" Accordingly, discoveries that possess \"markedly different characteristics from any found in nature\" are eligible for patent protection, but any existing organism or newly discovered plant found in the wild is not patentable. Similarly in \"Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc.\", the Court held that claims on two naturally occurring, isolated genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2), which can be examined to determine whether a person is likely to develop breast cancer, were patent ineligible invalid under § 101, because the BRCA genes themselves were unpatentable products of nature.\n\nIt is not disputed that the donor sheep from which Dolly was cloned could not be patented, but Dolly is an exact copy of that unpatentable sheep. \"Dolly's genetic identity to her donor parent renders her unpatentable.\" An exact copy of a preexisting animal in not patent eligible. The court added that related Supreme Court rulings \"reinforce this conclusion\":\n\nFor example, Supreme Court decisions regarding the preemptive force of federal patent law confirm that individuals are free to copy any unpatentable article, such as a live farm animal, so long as they do not infringe a patented method of copying. \"Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Stiffel Co.\" clarified that a state may not \"prohibit the copying of [an] article itself or award damages for such copying\" when that article is ineligible for patent protection. In \"Sears\", the question was whether the defendant, Sears Roebuck & Co., could be held liable under state law for copying a lamp design whose patent protection had expired. The Court explained that \"when the patent expires the monopoly created by it expires, too, and the right to make the article—including the right to make it in precisely the shape it carried when patented—passes to the public.\" The Court further clarified that \"[a]n unpatentable article, like an article on which the patent has expired, is in the public domain and may be made and sold by whoever chooses to do so.\" Roslin's claimed clones are exact genetic copies of patent ineligible subject matter. Accordingly, they are not eligible for patent protection.\n\nRoslin argued that \"environmental factors\" lead to differences in shape, size, color, and behavior, that result from aging and the interaction of the animal with its environment. But Roslin acknowledged that any differences came about or were produced \"quite independently of any effort of the patentee.\" As in the \"Funk\" case: \"Their qualities are the work of nature. Those qualities are of course not patentable. For patents cannot issue for the discovery of the phenomena of nature.\" Roslin also argued that its clones are distinguishable from their original donor mammals because of differences in mitochondrial DNA, which originates from the donor egg rather than the donor nucleus. But the claims do not describe clones that have markedly different characteristics from the donor animals of which they are copies. Finally, Roslin argued that its clones are patent eligible because \"they are time-delayed versions of their donor mammals, and therefore different from their original mammals,\" but that is always true of any copy of an original.\n\n● Professor Dan Burk finds that \"the \"Roslin\" opinion is hardly a model of coherent judicial reasoning, either on its own terms or with regard to the Supreme Court's subject matter jurisprudence to that point.\" He insists that Dolly the cloned sheep was not something found in nature, because \"genetically identical mammals are not what one finds in the wild.\" Rather, \"mammals such as sheep propagate via sexual recombination which typically renders them \"not\" genetically identical.\" Furthermore, Dolly was born as an old sheep:\n\nBy virtue of inheriting a mature set of somatic cell chromosomes, rather than the freshly recombined set of germ-line chromosomes that would accompany natural conception, Dolly began life with shortened telomeres. Thus, Dolly was in a genetic sense 'born old' and lived a shortened life as a result.\n\nBurk argues that the proper test of patent eligibility for such a product as Dolly the sheep is whether the claim preempts field of the described subject matter, so that \"fundamental concepts and materials, on which all inventors must draw, [are] caught up in patent claims.\" He says that the Roslin patent would not \"capture fundamental or basic science on which future invention will depend, or if it does so, there is no indication in the \"Roslin\" opinion that this informed the analysis of patentable subject matter.\" According to Burk, the patent would not be preemptive because its covers only sheep or other mammals \"produced by the cloning process, a limitation that constrains the patent to the specific and novel implementation disclosed by the applicant.\"\n\n● Gene Quinn in \"IP Watchdog\" deplores the \"Roslin\" decision:\n\nAnother nail in the coffin of innovation and a functioning patent system all because decision makers don't have enough guts to state the obvious. Being able to create something that is identical to what nature creates is an extraordinary achievement that should be celebrated, should be fostered and incentivized, and should be awarded with a patent.\n\n● Student author Miriam Swedlow argues that \"Roslin\" would not prevent the patenting of extinct animals, such as the dodo, passenger pigeon, or wooly mammoth, because the cloned animal would not be identical to a natural animal. Like the cDNA in \"Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc.\", large portions of the genome of an extinct animal would need to be guessed at and extrapolated from non-extinct animals, because the DNA recoverable from fossils is decayed. Therefore, the \"re-created animal will not be an exact genetic copy of an animal that already exists and will have different structural characteristics than the original species.\" They would therefore be comparable to artificial animals such as the Oncomouse, which was patented. Moreover, the \"fragile nature of extinct animal DNA allows for multiple avenues of differentiation\" from the original, now-extinct animal, preempting none.\n"}

{"id": "37709760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37709760", "title": "Law of the Czech Republic", "text": "Law of the Czech Republic\n\nCzech law, often referred to as the legal order of the Czech Republic (\"\"), is the system of legal rules in force in the Czech Republic, and in the international community it is a member of. Czech legal system belongs to the Germanic branch of continental legal culture (civil law). Major areas of public and private law are divided into branches, among them civil, criminal, administrative, procedural and labour law, and systematically codified.\n\nWritten law is the basis of the legal order, and the most important source of law are: legal regulations (acts of parliament, as well as delegated legislation), international treaties (once they have been ratified by the parliament and promulgated), and such findings of the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic, in which a statute or its part has been nullified as unconstitutional. It is made public by the periodically published ', abbreviated \"Sb.\" (“Collection of Law”, “Coll.”), and ', abbreviated \"Sb. m. s.\" (“Collection of International Treaties”).\n\nThe system of law and justice in the Czech Republic has been in constant development since the 1989 regime change. In 1993, the Constitution of the Czech Republic has been enacted, which postulates the rule of law, outlines the structure and principles of democratic government, and declares human rights and rights of the citizen. Since 2004, the membership in the EU means the priority of European Union law over Czech law in some areas. Recently, a brand new Criminal Code entered into force in 2010, and the Civil Code followed in 2014.\n\nSources of Czech law are (in this hierarchical order):\n\n\nActs of parliament and other legal regulations enter into force on the day they are promulgated (published) in the official \"Collection of Law\" (', abbreviated as ' – \"Coll.\" – when referring to statutes), although they may take effect at a later date. International treaties are similarly published in the \"Collection of International Treaties\" (\"\", abbreviated \"Sb. m. s.\").\n\nCzech constitution is written, and it consists of several constitutional acts (one of them the Constitution of the Czech Republic), together they are known as the constitutional order of the Czech Republic (\"\").\n\nThe constitution can be viewed as entrenched, because constitutional statutes are more difficult to adopt, amend, supplement or repeal them than ordinary laws of the country. A special majority (constitutional supermajority) is required of three-fifths of all Deputies and a qualified majority of three-fifths of all Senators present. This is to promote continuity and stability of the political system.\n\nMost important constitutional acts are:\n\n\nThe 1992 Constitution of the Czech Republic declares sovereignty (self-government) of the people and the values of freedom and democracy. It defines the separation of the three powers in a system of Checks and balances. It gives the legislative power to the popularly elected Czech Parliament consisting of two chambers, the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. The executive power is divided between the President and the Prime Minister. It describes the functioning of the judiciary, especially the Constitutional Court. Two more institutions are established, the Czech National Bank and the Supreme Audit Office.\n\nThe Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms (\"\") is a bill of rights document enacted in 1991 by the Czechoslovak Federative Republic. In the Czech Republic it was kept in its entirety and forms a part of the constitutional order (i.e. has the same legal force as the Constitution). It postulates the sanctity of natural human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as citizens' (political) rights, the equality before the law, rights of minorities and so on.\n\nThe Constitution has been seriously modified in February 2012, introducing a controversial popular vote of the President of the Czech Republic:\n\n\nOn joining the European Union, the Czech Republic committed itself to respect the principle of the supremacy of European law over Czech law in defined areas.\n\nThe most important treaty in this category is the Council of Europe’s Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.\n\nMajor areas of Czech law are codified in a systematic manner.\n\nMost important statutes in the criminal justice field are:\n\n\nSince 2010, Czech criminal law is regulated mainly, though not only, by the Criminal Code Act 2009 ('), which codifies substantive criminal law. The comprehensive regulatory statute for criminal procedure is the Criminal Proceedings Code Act 1961 ('). The two codes are complemented by the Juvenile Criminal Justice Act 2003, which deals with alleged offenders aged between 15 (the threshold of criminal liability as well as age of legal consent) and 17.\n\nUntil 2009, the criminal code statute in force dated back to 1961. In spite of numerous amendments made since the 1989, it still conformed to the communist ideology, oriented on punishment of perceived enemies of the socialist regime. As a part of an effort to comprehensively reform law and justice, a brand new codification has been written. The Ministry of Justice announced it as an \"elaborate piece of work boiled down from the experience and knowledge of foremost expert on criminal law\", which can be proudly compared to modern criminal codes of other democratic countries.\n\nThe purpose of the 2009 codification was to bring the criminal justice system in line with the rest of Europe. The main change introduced by the code was transition from material to formal conception of criminal offence. Another thing the lawyers drafting the 2009 code had in mind, and expressed it in the area of sentencing tariffs, was a new balance of punishment against rehabilitation effect on the criminal. On one hand we see the sentences for felony (') which carry a sentence of at least 5 years. On the other a newly created category of misdemeanour (') introduces a host of community sentences ('), including community payback (') or house arrest (\"\"). The code also outlaws doping.\n\nLess serious breaches of law are called contraventions (\"\"). These are not normally dealt with by the courts of law, but rather punished either by the police on the spot, or through a procedure in front of a committee at the local or municipal authority, or sometimes other administration body. The result is not a conviction, and so such a punishment will not blemish the culprit's criminal record. Like with other administrative acts, the outcome of this procedure can be challenged through the administrative justice process. A typical example of contraventions in Czech law this are driving offences. (In the common law world, acts falling into this category would be classed as summary offences.)\n\nSince 2012, Czech law also recognizes criminal liability of corporations for offences committed by employees of a corporation, when acting on its behalf, being instructed by the board of directors or other representative of the company, or through lack of their action. In such cases, not only individuals will be prosecuted, but the corporation can be prosecuted as well for the same offence and punished by a host of measures, starting from cetrain injunctions, through fines a forfeitures, to liquidation of the company.\n\n\nMain statutes regulating this area are:\n\n\nThe Civil Code codifies core areas of private law. It has five parts. The first part is dedicated to a legal status of a person as an individual. The second regulates family law – e.g. the institute of marriage and the rights and obligations of husband and wife, parents and children. Although the Code does include registered partnership, it explicitly prohibits adoption to a person in a registered partnership. The rest in concerned mainly with property rights.\n\nThe civil code regulation effective since 1 January 2014 is a result of eleven years of work of the recodification committee of the Ministry of Justice. Together with the Commercial Corporations Act and the Private International Law Act it constitutes a complete recodification of private law in the Czech Republic. It brings new and modern regulation of relations governed by civil law, with emphasis on personality rights, free will / more choice when writing a will or unified regulation of obligation laws.\n\nTheoretically, case law is not defined as a source of law in the Czech Republic. Despite that, the decisions of courts, namely supreme courts and the Constitutional Court, have a significant influence over the Czech legal system since 1989. Findings of the Constitutional Court are considered a source of law, and are binding for general courts. If a lower court is to rule against \"consistent adjudications\" of the Supreme Court on the point of law, it must give detailed reasoning, and this can often be a reason for a successful appeal. This system is largely based on judiciary's own interpretation of the Constitution, arguing that it gives citizens predictability and fairness. The most significant judgements of both courts are published in the official Collection of Laws.\n\nIn Czech lands, the process of formation of modern legislation dates back to the era of enlightened absolutism, when they were a core part of the Austrian Empire. Reforms of government were to a large extent the work of empress Maria Theresa and her son Joseph II, who participated in creating the first civil code of the country in 1787, called Josephinisches Gesetzbuch. This was a forbearer to the comprehensive codification of civil law in 1811, known as the Allgemeines bürgerliches Gesetzbuch (ABGB). ABGB was received in 1918 by Czechoslovakia, among other successor states, but only for Czech lands (Bohemia, Moravia and Austrian Silesia), while Slovakia kept the customary law of Hungary. Albeit updated many times, this Austrian law was kept in Czechoslovakia, along with the legal duality, until 1950, when the \"Middle Civil Code\" was promulgated, soon to be superseded by the civil code of 1964, which will be in force until the \"New Civil Code\", enacted in 2009, will enter in force in 2014.\n\nFollowing in the tracks of their enlightenment predecessors, the Constitutio criminalis Josephina of 1707 and the Constitutio criminalis Theresiana of 1768, the most important Czechoslovakian criminal codes were enacted in 1950, 1961 and 2009.\n\nThe history of Czechoslovak constitutionality starts with the formation of independent Czechoslovakia out of the ruins of Austria-Hungary. In 1918, the Interim Constitution of Czechoslovakia has been enacted hastily, establishing the republic with its president and temporary parliament. The Czechoslovak Constitution of 1920 succeeded it, inspired by western democratic constitutions, and, controversially, postulating the Czechoslovak nation. This lasted over the First Republic and the second world war. In 1948, the so-called Ninth-of-May Constitution was enacted after the communist coup – preserving some democratic institutions (human rights, partial division of the three powers, independent judiciary), though the political reality of the country departed from it radically. The 1960 Constitution of Czechoslovakia, influenced by soviet constitutions, is often dubbed the \"Socialist Constitution\". It changed the name of the country to Czechoslovak \"Socialist\" Republic and defined socialist, rather than democratic, character of the state, and introduced the leading role of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. The 1960 constitution remained in force until 1992, although in 1968 it was substantially modified by the Constitutional Act on the Czechoslovak Federation – this transformed the unitary state into a federation of the Czech Socialist Republic and the Slovak Socialist Republic. Further radical modifications were enacted after the regime change of 1989, but they turned out to be short-lived, as in 1992 the Constitution of the Czech Republic has been promulgated after the division of Czechoslovakia, and entered into force in 1993.\n\n\n"}

Kansas, 123 U.S. 623 (1887), was an important United States Supreme Court case in which the 8–1 opinion of Associate Justice John Marshall Harlan and the lone partial dissent by Associate Justice Stephen Johnson Field laid the foundation for the Supreme Court's later acceptance and defense during the Lochner era of Justice Field's theory of economic substantive due process under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe companion case was \"Kansas v. Ziebold & Hagelin\".\n\nAs part of the burgeoning temperance movement, the people of Kansas amended their state constitution on November 2, 1880:\nThe Kansas Legislature subsequently enacted an accompanying statute on February 19, 1881 that provided that after May 1, 1881, any person who manufactured or aided in the manufacture of any liquor without an appropriate permit would be guilty of a misdemeanor. First-time violators were to be fined not less than $100 nor more than $500 or to be imprisoned in the county jail for not less than 20 nor more than 90 days.\n\nOn March 7, 1885, the legislature supplemented the statute by providing that all places in which intoxicating liquors were manufactured, sold, bartered, or given away or kept for sale, barter, or use were a nuisance and subject to abatement where a court judged them so. Courts adjudicating nuisance complaints were to sit in equity; also, the statute required the state meet the burden of proving oy that the defendant did not possess a permit, in which case the judge must declare the place complained of a nuisance. Offending owners of nuisances were to be fined not less than $100 nor more than $500 or to be imprisoned in the county jail for not less than 30 nor more than 90 days.\n\nIn 1877, prior to the passage of the Kansas constitutional amendment and its accompanying statute, Peter Mugler had built a brewery in Salina, Kansas. He spent $10,000 on the brewery’s construction and had obtained a corporate charter from the state allowing him to operate a brewery. It was completed in 1877 and used for the manufacture of intoxicating malt liquor, commonly known as beer, up until May 1, 1881. Following the enactment of the statute, Mugler did not obtain a permit for the manufacture or sale of alcohol. Further, the brewery-specific design of Mugler's facility allegedly made it difficult to employ in other trades, subsequently dropping the value of the building to only $2500.\n\nZiebold and Hagelin were operating a brewery in Atchison County, Kansas.\n\nIn November 1881, authorities indicted Peter Mugler in the District Court of Saline County, Kansas for violation of the statutes. The first indictment contained five counts alleging Mugler had sold, bartered, or given away intoxicating liquors without a permit; a sixth count alleged his brewery was a public nuisance for being a place used in violation of the statute. The second indictment contained one count alleging Mugler had manufactured intoxicating liquors without a permit.\n\nThe District Court found Mugler guilty and fined him $100 and court fees. It subsequently rejected the defendant's motions for a new trial and for an arrest of judgment. The Kansas Supreme Court affirmed on appeal.\n\nIn August 1886, authorities filed an information in the District Court of Atchison County, Kansas against Ziebold and Hagelin for operating a brewery. On defendant's motion, the case was removed to the US Circuit Court under its equity jurisdiction. The Circuit Court dismissed the bill of information; the State of Kansas appealed.\n\nDoes a state law prohibiting the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors, subsequently rendering property used for the purposes described of little economic value, deprive the owner of that property in conflict with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?\n\nMugler's attorney posited two arguments:\n\nThe attorney for Ziebold and Hagelin echoed Mugler's two arguments but posited an additional argument attacking the nuisance statute, which allowed for the destruction of all property used in keeping and maintaining the nuisance without a trial by jury, as a denial of due process. The state, according to Ziebold and Hagelin's attorney, was using the nuisance provision out of order; instead of trying and convicting the defendants first, and then subsequently declaring the property a nuisance on the fact of their conviction and enabling authorities to destroy the liquors, the state was instead using the nuisance statutes to convict the defendants without trial. The statute removed the presumption of innocence once the state had proved the owners of the alleged nuisance did not have a permit.\n\nOn December 5, 1887, the US Supreme Court upheld 8–1 the ruling of the Supreme Court of Kansas, thus affirming Mugler's convictions. Associate Justice John Marshall Harlan, writing for the majority, held that a state’s legislation prohibiting the manufacture of intoxicating liquor within its jurisdiction does not infringe on any right or privilege secured by the Constitution of the United States. Addressing Mugler's first argument, the Court stated its belief that the principle requiring property holders not to use their property so as to be injurious to the community was compatible with the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nHowever, the Court decided that it possessed the power to inquire into the intentions of the legislature behind police power regulations to settle disputes over the relatedness of the regulation to a state's use of the police power.\n\nTurning to Mugler's second argument, the Court found the authority for the statute in this case strictly relied upon Kansas's police power. Since the statute dealt with the health, the safety, and the morals of the population, the Court rejected Mugler's reliance on \"Pumpelly\", distinguishing the \"Pumpelly\" case as a use solely of the state's power of eminent domain; the Court reasoned that a prohibition on the use of property, by valid legislation, for purposes of protecting the health and safety of the community cannot be deemed a taking or an appropriation of property for public benefit. Since the legislation did not restrict the owners control, right to dispose, or ability to use for lawful purposes, no taking had occurred.\n\nFurther, the Court held that states cannot be burdened with the condition that they must compensate individual owners for incidental losses suffered as a result of a prohibition on the use of property. Additionally, property values which depreciate as a result of the state's exercise of the police power is different from taking property for public use. In one case a nuisance is abated; in the other, property is taken away from the owner completely. If public safety requires certain action be taken by the legislature, lawmakers cannot be persuaded from discontinuing such activity because individuals will suffer incidental inconveniences.\n\n"}

{"id": "45626458", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45626458", "title": "Octennial Act", "text": "Octennial Act\n\nThe Octennial Act (7 George III c.3; long title \"An act for limiting the duration of parliaments\") was a 1768 act of the Parliament of Ireland which set a maximum duration of eight years for the Irish House of Commons. Before this, a dissolution of parliament was not required except on the demise of the Crown, and the previous three general elections were held in 1715, 1727, and 1761, on the respective deaths of Anne, George I, and George II. After the act, general elections were held in 1769, 76, 83, 90, and 98.\n\nLimiting the duration of parliament was a prime objective of the Patriot Party. Heads of bills were brought, by Charles Lucas in 1761 and 1763 and by Henry Flood in 1765, to limit parliament to seven years as the Septennial Act 1716 did for the Parliament of Great Britain. The heads were rejected by the Privy Council of Great Britain, which, under Poynings' Law, had to pre-approve any bill before it was formally introduced in the Irish parliament.\n\nSince the end of the Seven Years' War in 1763, the British government had wished to increase the size of Irish regiments, the part of the British Army charged on the Irish exchequer rather than the British. In 1767, the Chatham Ministry appointed George Townshend, 4th Viscount Townshend as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and instructed him to secure the support of the Irish parliament for an Augmentation Bill to effect this increase. The British considered several possible concessions to win over the Patriot Party, and at his speech from the throne, Townshend promised judicial tenure quamdiu se bene gesserint (on the model of the Act of Settlement 1701) and hinted at a Septennial Act. Lucas again introduced heads of a Septennial Bill on 20 October 1767; Barry Maxwell introduced heads of a judicial tenure bill the same day. In November, the appointment of James Hewitt, 1st Baron Lifford as Lord Chancellor of Ireland alienated the Undertakers who had hoped for the post. In addition, the British Privy Council added a wrecking clause to the judicial tenure bill, which caused the Irish parliament to reject the bill once returned to Dublin. The council also made three amendments to Lucas' bill: to the preamble, to extend the limit from seven to eight years (thus an Octennial Bill) and to bring forward the date of the next general election from 1774 to 1768. According to Francis Plowden, the Privy Council insisted on the modification to eight years as a wrecking amendment, expecting that the Irish parliament would reject the bill on principle once any amendment had been made to it, and was disappointed when its amended bill was passed. W. E. H. Lecky calls this \"without foundation\", stating the actual reasons for eight years were that the Irish Parliament only met every second year, and to reduce the chance of Irish and British general elections coinciding.\n\nThe Octennial Act reinvigorated the Commons, both with newly elected reformers and with MPs made more active by the prospect of imminent re-election. Changes included more assertiveness over supply bills and Poynings' Law, easing the penal laws, and securing the Constitution of 1782. There were unsuccessful attempts to shorten the maximum duration, in 1773 by Sir William Parsons and in 1777 by Sir Edward Newenham.\n\nThe act was rendered moot when the Parliament of Ireland was abolished by the Act of Union 1800. It was formally repealed by the Statute Law Revision (Ireland) Act 1879.\n\n"}

The initiative was intended to reduce the entry of Mexican marijuana into the United States at a time that was considered to be the prime harvest season. It was implemented by Myles Ambrose, who served as the Commissioner of Customs in the Nixon administration.\n\nThe policy was instituted as a surprise move, although President Nixon had given Mexican President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz some advance warning when they met on September 8, 1969 to dedicate the Lake Amistad Dam International Crossing. The effort involved increased surveillance of the border from both air and sea, but the major part of the policy was the individual inspection, mandated to last three minutes, of every vehicle crossing into the United States from Mexico. Because of complaints from cross-border travelers, and from Mexican President Diaz Ordaz, the searching of vehicles was reduced after 10 days and completely abandoned after about 20 days.\n\nThe Nixon Administration believed that it had largely achieved its goal of encouraging the Mexican government to begin an effort to stem domestic drug production.\n\nIn the early part of 1970, the Jefferson Airplane released a single entitled ‘Mexico’ c/w ‘Have You Seen the Saucers’. ‘Mexico’ was not played on some radio stations at the time because the lyrics referred to Operation Intercept, but this song became a classic on many of the so-called underground radio stations.\n\n"}

The 14th defendant had their case handled separately.\n\nNew York-based attorney Stanley Cohen, who represented one of the defendants, claimed that the 13 committed acts of civil disobedience in political dissent, adding that he thinks that the acts were free speech protected by the First Amendment. In an interview for SKP News Cohen compared the digital 'sit-in' to protests organized by the civil rights movement. Cohen further noted that the guilty pleas were for misdemeanors resulting in probation, instead of having the defendants face possible felony convictions and jail sentences. A fine of $86,000 is being equally distributed among the 13 activists, each owing $6,615. The fine must be paid by December 2014.\n\nIt is unclear how many people actually took part in the attacks. Pierre Omidyar, founder of the online market eBay, asked federal prosecutors to show leniency, stating that \"[i]n those cases, I believe justice requires leniency.

Each filed a petition with the Probate Court of Ada County, Idaho, asking to be named. Idaho Code specified that \"males must be preferred to females\" in appointing administrators of estates and the court appointed Cecil as administrator of the estate, valued at less than $1000. Sally Reed was represented at the Supreme Court by Idaho lawyer, Allen Derr, who argued that the Fourteenth Amendment forbids discrimination based on gender.\n\nAfter a series of appeals by both Sally and Cecil Reed, the Supreme Court considered the case and delivered a unanimous decision that held the Idaho Code's preference in favor of males was arbitrary and unconstitutional.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled for the first time in \"Reed v. Reed\" that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibited differential treatment based on sex.\n\nBecause the Idaho Code made a distinction based on sex, the court reasoned that \"it thus establishes a classification subject to scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause\" and using the generic standard of scrutiny—ordinary or rational basis review—asked \"whether a difference in the sex of competing applicants for letters of administration bears a rational relationship to a state objective.\"\n\nChief Justice Burger's opinion said:\nBefore the Supreme Court decided the case, Idaho amended its statutes to eliminate the mandatory preference for males, effective July 1, 1972.\n\nRuth Bader Ginsburg, later an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, wrote the plaintiff's brief, to which she added the names of Pauli Murray and Dorothy Kenyon as co-authors in recognition of her debt to their work.\n\nThose who brought the case had hoped for a broader decision that would have deemed all classifications based on sex \"suspect\", a category the Supreme Court reserved for race.

The laws are named after Nelson Rockefeller, who was the state's governor at the time the laws were adopted. Rockefeller had previously backed drug rehabilitation, job training and housing as strategies, having seen drugs as a social problem rather a criminal one, but did an about-face during a period of mounting national anxiety about drug use and crime. Rockefeller, a staunch supporter of the bill containing the laws, had Presidential ambitions and so wanted to raise his national posture by being \"tough on crime.\" If this strategy worked, he would no longer be seen as too liberal to be elected. He signed it on May 8, 1973.\n\nUnder the Rockefeller drug laws, the penalty for selling or more of heroin, morphine, \"raw or prepared opium,\" cocaine, or cannabis or possessing or more of the same substances, was a minimum of 15 years to life in prison, and a maximum of 25 years to life in prison. The original legislation also mandated the same penalty for committing a violent crime while under the influence of the same drugs, but this provision was subsequently omitted from the bill and was not part of the legislation Rockefeller ultimately signed. The section of the laws applying to marijuana was repealed in 1977, under the Democratic Governor Hugh Carey.\n\nThe adoption of the Rockefeller drug laws gave New York State the distinction of having the toughest laws of its kind in the entire United States — an approach soon imitated by the state of Michigan, which, in 1978, enacted a \"650-Lifer Law,\" which called for life imprisonment, without the possibility of parole for the sale, manufacture, or possession of at least of cocaine or any Schedule I or Schedule II opiate.\n\nThe laws were enacted at a time of mounting anxiety regarding drug addiction and crime, and arguments from some politicians that a draconian approach was needed. In 1971, President Richard Nixon declared in a White House briefing speech:\n\nHowever, according to a 2016 article in \"Harper's Magazine\" article, John Ehrlichman, who had been Nixon's domestic-policy adviser, told reporter Dan Baum in a 1994 interview:\n\nBoth the New York and Michigan statutes came under harsh criticism from both the political left and the political right. William F. Buckley, one of the most conservative public figures in America, was staunchly against it, as well as many in law enforcement, who saw inherent unfairness in placing the non-violent crime of drug trafficking on a par with murder. Economist Murray Rothbard called the laws \"draconian: long jail sentences for heroin pushers and addicts. The Rockefeller program, which proved finally to be a fiasco, was the epitome of the belief in treating a social or medical problem with jail and the billy club.\" The laws also drew intense opposition from civil rights advocates, who claimed that they were racist, as they were applied inordinately to African-Americans and, to a lesser extent, Latinos.\n\nIn 2002, at age 46, Meile Rockefeller was arrested for protesting the Rockefeller drug laws. She was accompanied by her brother, Stuart Rockefeller, and was supported by other members of the family on the issue, including her grandfather's brother, Laurance Rockefeller.\n\nDue to the implementation of the Rockefeller drug laws, Incarceration rates were also said to have risen with since its inception in 1973, 150,000 New Yorkers being imprisoned for non-violent drug offenses. Part of the reason for the rising incarceration rates was due to how the Rockefeller drug laws may have imposed harsher penalties for non-violent drug offenses, but crimes related to drug use did not decrease. Throughout the 1980s this was only made worse with the imposing drug laws on dawning the newly highly popularized drug of crack-cocaine, which is said to have \"caused the New York State prison population to triple.\" As of 1973, the state's prison population was approximately at ten thousand, but with the help of the Rockefeller drug laws, by the year 2002 out of the approximately seventy thousand state inmates, \"19,164 were incarcerated for drug offenses\" which upon drug offenses alone had nearly doubled the state population of 1973. Even despite the steady drop in crime rates that took place in the 1990s, the effects of the Rockefeller Drug Laws were the most transparent where \"high arrest rates and prison commitments for drug offenses continued to fill prison cells.\" Another criticism of the Rockefeller drug laws has also been its distinct targeting of young minority males for as of the year 2000, black and Hispanic males made up over 90% of the population incarcerated for Rockefeller Drug Laws.\n\nMichigan's statute was reformed somewhat in 1998, with the mandatory life sentence being reduced to a 20-year minimum.\n\nOn December 14, 2004, New York Governor George Pataki signed into law the Drug Law Reform Act (DLRA) (2004 N.Y. Laws Ch. 738 (effective January 13, 2005)), which replaced the indeterminate sentencing scheme of the Rockefeller Drug Laws with a determinate system. The DLRA also reduced the minimum penalty for conviction on the most serious (A-I felony) drug charge in New York from 15 years to life, to 8 years in prison, for an offender with no prior felonies.\n\nIn addition, the weight thresholds for the two most serious possession offenses (A-I and A-II) were doubled (thus making them apply to fewer defendants), and those serving life sentences were permitted to apply for re-sentencing. Since 2004, the number of prisoners serving sentences for A-I narcotics felonies has been cut by more than half.\n\nIn his first State of the State address in January 2009, New York Governor David Paterson was critical of the Rockefeller drug laws, stating, \"I can't think of a criminal justice strategy that has been more unsuccessful than the Rockefeller drug laws.\"\n\nIn April 2009, the New York Penal Law and the New York Criminal Procedure Law were revised to remove the mandatory minimum sentences. Under the new law, judges now had the authority to sentence defendants convicted of drug offences on guilty plea to shorter sentences, probation or drug treatment - the last known as \"Judicial Diversion\". Prior to 2009, drug treatment was available at the discretion of prosecutors. The sentencing was made retroactive, which allowed over 1000 incarcerated defendants to apply for resentencing and possible release.\n\nNew York City has been called the cannabis-arrest capital of the world, with over 40,000 arrests in 2008. Despite New York's decriminalization of simple possession, New York City police arrest suspects for possession in public view, which remains a misdemeanor. During a Terry stop, officers may falsely suggest that a suspect should voluntarily reveal contraband to avoid arrest, then arrest the suspect if he reveals cannabis to public view. In 2008, the New York Civil Liberties Union criticized the crackdown for its cost and scope, its reliance on stop-and-frisks and police coercion to escalate simple possession into an arrestable offense, and the disproportionate number of young, black and Latino males arrested.\n\nOne main criticism of these drug laws were that they put young minority males and females behind bars for carrying small amounts of drugs on them. These laws were a part of the \"war on drugs\" era and were meant to go after drug king pins, however it started to target lower level people as a means of keeping the streets clean. Elaine Bartlett and her story told in the book \"Life on the Outside\" critically depicts the effects of the Rockefeller Drug Laws and its policy on drug dealers.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7255411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7255411", "title": "Rule of capture", "text": "Rule of capture\n\nThe rule of capture or law of capture is common law from England, adopted by a number of U.S. jurisdictions, that establishes a rule of non-liability and ownership of captured natural resources including groundwater, oil, gas, and game animals. The general rule is that the first person to \"capture\" such a resource owns that resource. For example, a landowner who extracts or “captures” groundwater, oil, or gas from a well that bottoms within the subsurface of his land acquires absolute ownership of the substance, even if it is drained from the subsurface of another’s land. The landowner that captures the substance owes no duty of care to other landowners. For example, a water well owner may dry up wells owned by adjacent landowners without fear of liability, unless the groundwater was withdrawn for malicious purposes, the groundwater was not put to a beneficial use without waste, or (in Texas) \"such conduct is a proximate cause of the subsidence of the land of others\". A corollary of this rule is that a person who drills for groundwater, oil, or gas may not extract the substance from a well that bottoms within the subsurface estate of another by drilling on a slant.\n\nWhen presented with oil and gas cases, early common law jurists were somewhat reluctant to recognize a corporeal possessory interest in substances they considered to be fugacious or “wild and migratory,” and therefore subject to loss by drainage. Among U.S. states, two different theories of ownership of oil and gas arose. Some states, such as Texas, have adopted the “ownership-in-place” theory for oil and gas that a landowner owns a corporeal possessory interest (similar to a fee simple) in the substances beneath his land, but his ownership is a determinable fee subject to the rule of capture. Other states, like Oklahoma, have adopted the “exclusive-right-to-take” theory that a landowner does not own the substances that underlie his land, but merely retains the exclusive right to capture the substances, a non-corporeal interest. The difference between the two theories is primarily of import in determining remedies.\n\nSubsurface ownership boundaries are the same as those upon the surface, projected downward to the center of the earth. This concept is based upon the Roman legal principle of property law, \"cuius est solum eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos\" (for whosoever owns the soil, it is theirs up to the sky and down to the depths).\n\nThe rule of capture creates an incentive for an owner to drill as many wells as possible on his piece of land so as to extract the groundwater, oil, or gas before his neighbor. Very dense drilling can result in dissipation of the pressure within an aquifer or oil and gas reservoir, and therefore overdrafting of the aquifer or incomplete extraction of the substance. To mitigate this danger, many states have sought to supersede the rule of capture with conservation acts. Such acts enforce prorationing, pooling, and limits on density of drilling to avoid physical waste and ensure maximum ultimate recovery.\n\nStates following the ownership-in-place theory have actions available, including adverse possession and trespass.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3736929", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3736929", "title": "Self-defense (Sweden)", "text": "Self-defense (Sweden)\n\nIn Sweden, the law of self-defense () allows a person attacked to excuse or justify a proportionate use of violence in defense of the person or property.\n\nChapter 24 of the Swedish criminal code states various conditions for which a person will not be sentenced in court for committing an otherwise criminal act. Self-defense is considered grounds for non-conviction if the accused acted in a situation of peril and acted in a manner that is not \"blatantly unjustifiable\" in relation to that which is defended.\n\nA situation of peril is stated to exist if:\n\nThe interpretation of what is to be considered not \"blatantly unjustifiable\" is popularly expressed in Sweden as \"that force which is required by the peril\". In other words, the defending party may do whatever it takes so long as no alternative, less severe options are available (except fleeing the immediate area 1969 p425, 1999 p460). The expression \"blatantly unjustifiable\" allows fairly generous tolerance towards the defending party.\n\nHowever, the defending party must also consider that which is defended and what injury is inflicted upon the attacker. If that which is defended is insignificant in comparison to the injuries to the attacker, the court may reject the claim that person acted in self-defense since the damage done to the attacker \"is\" \"blatantly unjustifiable\". Loss of life or permanent bodily injury is rarely justified as self-defense unless the defending party was in danger of being subjected to the same.\n\nFor example, if the only way of stopping a criminal from escaping with stolen property would be by killing them, then it would not be justifiable to do so. This is because that which is defended (property) is not as valuable as a human life and therefore the action of killing the criminal is not justifiable.\n\nSwedish legal custom in regards to self-defense states that peril is subjective. This means that the peril is measured from what the defending party \"perceived\" as peril and not the actual peril.\n\nFor example, if a person were to threaten someone with an unloaded gun (not an actual lethal threat), the defending party would not be convicted if defending themselves as if the gun were loaded (a lethal threat). This is because the defending party may perceive the gun as loaded and thus lethal.\n\nA person who commits acts which are \"blatantly unjustifiable\" while in peril may also escape conviction if the situation were such that the person \"could not be expected to maintain control of himself\". For instance, such a situation might be if the defending party were in a state of great fear or severe rage because of the peril.\n\nThe Swedish criminal code states that anyone who assists a defending party in peril shall have the same rights as the defending party.\n\n"}

{"id": "1811656", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1811656", "title": "Slavery Abolition Act 1833", "text": "Slavery Abolition Act 1833\n\nThe Slavery Abolition Act 1833 (3 & 4 Will. IV c. 73) abolished slavery throughout the British Empire. This Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom expanded the jurisdiction of the Slave Trade Act 1807 which made the purchase or ownership of slaves illegal within the British Empire, with the exception \"of the Territories in the Possession of the East India Company\", Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), and Saint Helena. The Act was repealed in 1997 as a part of wider rationalisation of English statute law; however, later anti-slavery legislation remains in force.\n\nIn May 1772, Lord Mansfield's judgment in the \"Somersett's Case\" emancipated a slave in England and thus helped launch the movement to abolish slavery. The case ruled that slavery was unsupported by law in England and no authority could be exercised on slaves entering English or Scottish soil. In 1785, English poet William Cowper wrote:\n\nWe have no slaves at home – Then why abroad?Slaves cannot breathe in England; if their lungsReceive our air, that moment they are free.They touch our country, and their shackles fall.That's noble, and bespeaks a nation proud.And jealous of the blessing. Spread it then,And let it circulate through every vein.\n\nBy 1783, an anti-slavery movement to abolish the slave trade throughout the Empire had begun among the British public. In 1793, Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada John Graves Simcoe signed the Act Against Slavery. Passed by the local Legislative Assembly, it was the first legislation to outlaw the slave trade in a part of the British Empire.\n\nIn 1807, Parliament passed the Slave Trade Act of 1807, which outlawed the slave trade, but not slavery itself. This legislation imposed fines that did little to deter slave trade participants. Abolitionist Henry Brougham realized that trading had continued and as a new MP successfully introduced the Slave Trade Felony Act 1811 which at last made slave a felony act through the empire. The Royal Navy established the West Africa Squadron to suppress the Atlantic slave trade by patrolling the coast of West Africa. It did suppress the slave trade, but did not stop it entirely. Between 1808 and 1860, the West Africa Squadron captured 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans. They resettled many in Jamaica and the Bahamas. Britain also used its influence to coerce other countries to agree treaties to end their slave trade and allow the Royal Navy to seize their slave ships.\n\nThe British were, by the late eighteenth century, the biggest proponents of the abolition of slavery worldwide. It was ironic, since they had in previous centuries been the worlds largest slave dealers.\n\nIn 1823, the Anti-Slavery Society was founded in London. Members included Joseph Sturge, Thomas Clarkson, William Wilberforce, Henry Brougham, Thomas Fowell Buxton, Elizabeth Heyrick, Mary Lloyd, Jane Smeal, Elizabeth Pease, and Anne Knight. William Wilberforce had written in his diary in 1787 that his great purpose in life was to suppress the slave trade before waging a 20-year fight on the industry.\n\nDuring the Christmas holiday of 1831, a large-scale slave revolt in Jamaica, known as the Baptist War, broke out. It was organised originally as a peaceful strike by the Baptist minister Samuel Sharpe. The rebellion was suppressed by the militia of the Jamaican plantocracy and the British garrison ten days later in early 1832. Because of the loss of property and life in the 1831 rebellion, the British Parliament held two inquiries. The results of these inquiries contributed greatly to the abolition of slavery with the Slavery Abolition Act 1833.\n\nThe Act had its third reading in the House of Commons on 26 July 1833, three days before William Wilberforce died. It received the Royal Assent a month later, on August 28, and came into force the following year, on 1 August 1834. In practical terms, only slaves below the age of six were freed in the colonies. Former slaves over the age of six were redesignated as \"apprentices\", and their servitude was abolished in two stages: the first set of apprenticeships came to an end on 1 August 1838, while the final apprenticeships were scheduled to cease on 1 August 1840. The Act specifically excluded \"the Territories in the Possession of the East India Company, or to the Island of Ceylon, or to the Island of Saint Helena.\" The exceptions were eliminated in 1843.\n\nThe Act provided for compensation for slave-owners. The amount of money to be spent on the compensation claims was set at \"the Sum of Twenty Million Pounds Sterling\". Under the terms of the Act, the British government raised £20 million (£16.5 billion in 2013 pounds, when calculated as wage values) to pay out in compensation for the loss of the slaves as business assets to the registered owners of the freed slaves. In 1833, £20 million amounted to 40% of the Treasury's annual income or approximately 5% of the British GDP (5% of the British GDP in 2016 was around £100 billion). To finance the compensation, the British government had to take on a £15 million loan, finalised on 3 August 1835, with banker Nathan Mayer Rothschild and his brother-in-law Moses Montefiore. The money was not paid back until 2015. \n\nHalf of the money went to slave-owning families in the Caribbean and Africa, while the other half went to absentee owners living in Britain. The names listed in the returns for slave compensation show that ownership was spread over many hundreds of British families, many of them (though not all) of high social standing. For example, Henry Phillpotts (then the Bishop of Exeter), with three others (as trustees and executors of the will of John Ward, 1st Earl of Dudley), was paid £12,700 for 665 slaves in the West Indies, whilst Henry Lascelles, 2nd Earl of Harewood received £26,309 for 2,554 slaves on 6 plantations. The majority of men and women who were awarded compensation under the 1833 Abolition Act are listed in a Parliamentary Return, entitled Slavery Abolition Act, which is an account of all moneys awarded by the Commissioners of Slave Compensation in the \"Parliamentary Papers\" 1837-8 (215) vol. 48.\n\nOn 1 August 1834, an unarmed group of mainly elderly people being addressed by the Governor at Government House in Port of Spain, Trinidad, about the new laws, began chanting: \"Pas de six ans. Point de six ans\" (\"Not six years. No six years\"), drowning out the voice of the Governor. Peaceful protests continued until a resolution to abolish apprenticeship was passed and \"de facto\" freedom was achieved. Full emancipation for all was legally granted ahead of schedule on 1 August 1838.\n\nAs a notable exception to the rest of the British Empire, the Act did not extend to any of the Territories administered by the East India Company, including the islands of Ceylon, and Saint Helena. Slavery was criminalised in the Company territories via the Indian Slavery Act of 1843.\n\nA successor organisation to the Anti-Slavery Society was formed in London in 1839, the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society, which worked to outlaw slavery worldwide. The world's oldest international human rights organisation, it continues today as Anti-Slavery International.\n\nIt is believed that after 1833 clandestine slave-trading continued within the British Empire; in 1854 Nathaniel Isaacs, owner of the island of Matakong off the coast of Sierra Leone was accused of slave-trading by the governor of Sierra Leone, Sir Arthur Kennedy. Papers relating to the charges were lost when the \"Forerunner\" was wrecked off Madeira in October 1854. In the absence of the papers, the English courts refused to proceed with the prosecution.\n\nIn Australia, blackbirding and the holding of indigenous workers' pay \"in trust\" continued, in some instances into the 1970s.\n\nModern slavery, both in the form of human trafficking and people imprisoned for forced or compulsory labour, continues to this day.\n\nThe Slavery Abolition Act 1833 was repealed in its entirety by the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1998. The repeal has not made slavery legal again, with sections of the Slave Trade Act 1824, Slave Trade Act 1843 and Slave Trade Act 1873 continuing in force. In its place the Human Rights Act 1998 incorporates into British Law Article 4 of the European Convention on Human Rights which prohibits the holding of persons as slaves.\n\nAva DuVernay was commissioned by the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture to create a film which debuted at the museum's opening on September 24, 2016. This film, \"August 28: A Day in the Life of a People\", tells of six significant events in African-American history that happened on the same date, August 28. Events depicted include (among others) William IV's royal assent to the Slavery Abolition Act.\n\n\n\n"}

He is also the founder and organizer of the annual Memphis Peace Conference, which includes an Inter-Faith and a Community Panel and was first held at Withers Collection Museum and Gallery in Memphis on Sep 29, 2018. \n\nTM Garret was born as Achim Schmid in Mosbach, Germany and raised in a small nearby town. He was raised by his mother, a cook, after his parents divorced. His father, a boatman, died later when Garret was 8 years old. He became attracted to Nationalist groups at the age of 13 and radicalized in the years after.\n\nHe joined the White Supremacist movement and founded a series of skinhead bands with names like Celtic Moon, Wolfsrudel (Wolfspack) and Höllenhunde (Hounds of Hell). Later he became a member of a German Ku Klux Klan faction and formed his own KKK group which he later left; it disbanded in 2002. \n\nToday, Garret is an anti-racist activist and lives in Horn Lake, Mississippi.

{"id": "643520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=643520", "title": "Tampa affair", "text": "Tampa affair\n\nIn August 2001, the Howard Government of Australia refused permission for the Norwegian freighter MV \"Tampa\", carrying 433 rescued refugees (predominantly Hazaras of Afghanistan from a distressed fishing vessel in international waters) and 5 crew to enter Australian waters. This triggered an Australian political controversy in the lead up to the 2001 federal election, and a diplomatic dispute between Australia and Norway.\n\nWhen the \"Tampa\" entered Australian water, the Prime Minister ordered the ship be boarded by Australian special forces. This brought censure from the government of Norway, which said the Australian government failed to meet its obligations to distressed mariners under international law at the United Nations. Within a few days, the government introduced the \"Border Protection Bill\" into the House of Representatives, saying it would confirm Australian sovereignty to \"determine who will enter and reside in Australia\". The government introduced the \"Pacific Solution\", whereby the asylum seekers were taken to Nauru where their refugee status was considered, rather than in Australia.\n\nIn the years leading up to 2001, increasing numbers of people attempted to travel to Australia by boat to seek asylum as refugees. Many of these arrived off Christmas Island, an Australian territory in the Indian Ocean, some 2000 km off the north-west coast of Australia and 500 km south of Jakarta, Indonesia. Hundreds of people arrived on tightly packed, unseaworthy vessels, and many paid large amounts of money to people smugglers for their passage to Australia.\n\nAt dawn on 24 August 2001, a 20 metre wooden fishing boat, the \"Palapa 1\", with 438 (369 men, 26 women and 43 children) mainly Hazara, became stranded in international waters about 140 km north of Christmas Island.\n\nOn 26 August, Rescue Coordination Centre (RCC) Australia, which had been aware of the vessel's distress, possibly through Coastwatch surveillance, requested all ships in the area to respond. Of the ships that acknowledged the request, the \"Tampa\" was closest to the site and began to proceed towards the distressed \"Palapa 1\".\n\nAccording to international law, survivors of a shipwreck are to be taken to the closest suitable port for medical treatment. The closest suitable port was 12 hours away in Merak, Indonesia. Christmas Island was six or seven hours closer, but it did not have the ability to receive large shipping freighters. \n\nThe Australian rescue authorities had been the first to become aware of the vessel's distress, and for some time attempted to contact the relevant Indonesian authorities to attend to the rescue. RCC sent a fax to the Indonesian Search and Rescue Agency (BASARNAS) on the night of 25 August but received no response. On Sunday, 26 August, Australian EST, the Australian embassy sent the naval attaché David Ramsay to visit BASARNAS. By this time, Australian surveillance had observed that the ship's passengers had fashioned signs that read \"SOS\" and 'HELP\" on the ship's deck and, in response, further attempts were made to contact BASARNAS, first by fax and then through the defence attaché in Jakarta. At this time, DIMA called RCC 'asking if vessels that respond to Australian search and rescue broadcast can tow the stranded vessel to Indonesia'.\n\nA call to shipping was broadcast at 12:48 Canberra time: \n\nSubject: Distress Relay. A 35-metre Indonesian type vessel with 80 plus persons on board adrift in the vicinity of 09.32.5 south 104.44 east… vessel has SOS and HELP written on the roof. Vessels within 10 hours report best ETA and intentions to this station.\n\nCaptain of the \"MV Tampa\" responded to the mayday call: \"We are on a voyage from Fremantle to Singapore via Sunda Strait… We have changed course and are headed for position of distress… Please advise further course of action. A Rinnan, Master.\" After an hour of setting course for the vessel, Rinnan received a direction from RCC apparently attempting to disown the rescue operation: \"Please note that Indonesian search and rescue authorities have accepted co-ordination of this incident.\"\n\nThe \"Tampa\" reached the vessel, guided by Australian Coastwatch de Havilland Dash-8 aircraft, at about 2 pm. The first child was lifted to safety at 2:30pm and the rescue operation continued all afternoon.\n\nRinnan recounted in an interview with \"Norway Today\":\nDuring the rescue, Rinnan received a call from Jakarta advising him to disembark the passengers at the ferry port of Merak, Indonesia.\n\nAbout half an hour after the \"Tampa\" had set sail toward Indonesia, a delegation of five asylum seekers visited the bridge to demand passage to Australian territory, specifically Christmas Island, or any western country. The group was quite aggressive and agitated and Rinnan agreed to alter course for Christmas Island.\n\nWhen interviewed by UK newspaper \"The Observer\", Rinnan explained: \"A delegation of five men came up to the bridge. They behaved aggressively and told us to go to Australia. They said they had nothing to lose.\"\n\nThe ship requested the Australian government's permission to unload the asylum seekers at Christmas Island, arguing that the ship could not sail to Indonesia, because it was unseaworthy — the ship was not designed for 438 people, only its 27 crew; and there were no lifeboats or other safety equipment available for the asylum seekers in the case of an emergency. The Australian government refused permission for the ship to enter Australia's territorial waters, and threatened to prosecute Captain Arne Rinnan as a people smuggler if it did so.\n\nThe Australian government denied any obligation under international law as Christmas Island lies within a zone designated as Indonesia's responsibility for rescue according to an agreement made in 1990 between Australia and Indonesia. Indonesia had also accepted co-ordination of the rescue, and the closest suitable port was Merak in Indonesia. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer explained to parliament that \"It is important that people understand that Australia has no obligation under International law to accept the rescued persons in to Australian territory.\" Australian ambassador David Stuart said in the United Nations that \"the rescue by the MV Tampa occurred outside the search and rescue region designated as being the responsibility of Australia.\" Although the \"Tampa\" had responded to a broadcast by an Australian rescue agency, on 30 August, Downer stated in parliament that the survivors were picked up \"at the direction of the Indonesian search and rescue authorities.\"\n\nFaced with Australia's threats of prosecution, Captain Rinnan agreed to turn slowly back towards Indonesia in the hope that the asylum seekers would not notice. About half an hour into the turn, however, they did notice and again became agitated. Captain Rinnan, concerned that if the ship continued to sail to Indonesia the asylum seekers could jump overboard or riot and harm the crew, decided to head back towards Christmas Island.\n\nAs the ship approached the boundary of Australia's territorial waters ( from the island), Captain Rinnan pleaded for permission for the ship to dock at Christmas Island. He reported that several of the asylum seekers were unconscious, and others were suffering from dysentery, statements subsequently supported by the SASR physician, but later disputed by Australian authorities. The Australian government provided medical assistance and food, but still refused permission for the ship to enter Australian territorial waters. The Australian government sent military personnel to Christmas Island, ostensibly to be ready to provide this assistance to the ship.\n\nOn 29 August, Captain Rinnan, having lost patience with the Australian authorities, and increasingly concerned for the safety of the asylum seekers and the ship's crew, declared a state of emergency and proceeded to enter Australian territorial waters without permission. The legality of this action has been the subject of debate, with the Australian government maintaining that it was illegal.\n\nThe Australian government responded by dispatching Australian troops (SASR) led by squadron commander Major Vance Khan, under Colonel Gus Gilmore, to board the ship and prevent it from approaching any closer to Christmas Island.\n\nThe SASR doctor later reported that the rescuees were generally dehydrated, malnourished and unhappy. Many were suffering from dehydration, exhaustion and minor ailments including sixty one cases of scabies, forty six of head lice, and twenty four of gastroenteritis. They also attended to four pregnant women.\n\nThere were some disputes between the SASR and the ship's medical officer Christian Maltau, a deck officer with limited medical experience, regarding the deployment of medical supplies from the \"Tampa\", and the use of the limited supplies of water. In one incident, the ship's officer turned off the ship's water supply while rescuees were being washed after an outbreak of diarrhoea.\n\nCaptain Rinnan anchored approximately four nautical miles off Christmas Island. Shortly afterwards the Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard, reported the boarding of the ship to the Australian Parliament.\n\nThe Australian troops instructed Captain Rinnan to move the ship back into international waters; he refused, claiming the ship was unsafe to sail until the asylum seekers had been offloaded. The ship-owners said they agreed with his decision, and the Norwegian government warned the Australian government not to seek to force the ship to return to international waters against the captain's will.\n\nThe Australian government tried to persuade Indonesia to accept the asylum seekers; Indonesia refused. Norway also refused to accept the asylum seekers and reported Australia to the United Nations, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and the International Maritime Organization for alleged failure to obey its duties under international law, though it did not ask for the assistance of these organisations.\n\nCaptain Rinnan received the highest civil honour in Norway as a result of his handling of this difficult incident. Rinnan has been a sailor since 1958, and a captain for 23 years. He said of the incident: \n\nI have seen most of what there is to see in this profession, but what I experienced on this trip is the worst. When we asked for food and medicine for the refugees, the Australians sent commando troops on board. This created a very high tension among the refugees. After an hour of checking the refugees, the troops agreed to give medical assistance to some of them… The soldiers obviously didn't like their mission.\n\nLate on the night of 29 August, the Prime Minister introduced an emergency bill entitled the \"Border Protection Bill 2001\". This Bill would have provided the government with the power to remove any ship in the territorial waters of Australia (s 4), to use reasonable force to do so (s 5), to provide that any person who was on the ship may be forcibly returned to the ship (s 6), that no civil or criminal proceedings may be taken against the Australian government or any of its officers for removing the ship or returning people to it (s 7), that no court proceedings are available to prevent the ship from being removed and from people being returned to it (s 8), and that no asylum applications may be made by people on board the ship (s 9). The bill was intended to enter into force at 9:00 Australian Eastern Standard Time, 29 August 2001 (s 2); thus making the bill retroactive. It also attempted to ensure actions taken prior to legislation passage to remove ship and return people to it would have been treated as legal.\n\nThe Opposition Labor Party announced they would not support the bill; nor would the Greens, Democrats or independent Senator Brian Harradine. The bill quickly passed the lower House of Representatives, but was rejected by the Senate later that same sitting day. The Government attacked the Opposition for refusing to pass the legislation, but indicated it would not reintroduce it at that stage.\n\nThe government subsequently acted to excise Christmas Island and a large number of other coastal islands from Australia's migration zone, effectively meaning that any asylum seekers who did not reach the Australian mainland would not be able to apply for refugee status. The Labor party supported the excision of some islands that it viewed as acting as a \"magnet for people smugglers\", but not others, such as Melville Island, Northern Territory which it viewed as being too close to the mainland to justify excision. The other parties opposed excision of any islands.\n\nInternationally, Australia was criticised by several countries, particularly Norway, which accused it of evading its human rights responsibilities.\n\nDomestically, the government's line attracted strong support, especially in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. The Australian government's popularity rating rose throughout the crisis. In the federal election following the arrival of the \"Tampa\", the Liberal Party campaigned on the issue, with John Howard's statement \"we decide who comes into this country and the circumstances in which they come.\"\n\nThe Australian electorate largely supported the Government. Some television news polls in Australia showed as much as 90 percent support for the Australian government's actions. Many viewed the asylum seekers as \"queue-jumpers\" falsely claiming to be refugees, and criminals who \"hijacked\" the Tampa to gain illegal entry into the country. There were concerns of a security risk involving a \"floodgates\" where people smugglers would deliberately target Australia as a perceived \"soft target\". Some public commentators, including then-Minister for Defence Peter Reith, suggested that groups of asylum seekers arriving by boat could harbour terrorists.\n\nIn 2003, economist Ross Gittins, a columnist at \"Fairfax Media\", said former Prime Minister John Howard had been \"a tricky chap \" on immigration, by appearing \"tough\" on illegal immigration to win support from the working class, while simultaneously winning support from employers with high legal immigration. \n\nThe issue also divided the Labor Party internally, with the Left faction of the party arguing strongly in favour of a \"softer\" approach, including the abolition of mandatory detention. The party leadership's compromise stance was pilloried by the Liberals as being wishy-washy and uncertain.\n\nIn July 2007, an unauthorised biography of John Howard claimed that he had received advice from the Attorney-General's Department that refusing the asylum seekers entry into Australia would breach international law, but that he did so to gain public support in the then upcoming election.\n\nThe refugees from the \"Tampa\" were loaded onto a Royal Australian Navy vessel, , which transported them to the small island country of Nauru, where most were held in two detention camps, State House and Topside. They were eventually joined by hundreds of other asylum seekers, under Australia's \"Pacific Solution\". Approximately 150 people were diverted to New Zealand, where they were subsequently granted asylum and progress to citizenship. In 2004, following the war in Afghanistan and invasion of Iraq, the New Zealand government began to reunite their families.\n\nWhen those refugees not claimed by New Zealand arrived on Nauru, many of them refused to leave the boat after several additional weeks on board waiting for temporary shelters to be constructed, recognising they were to be held in detention camps pending the adjudication of their cases. Those eventually found to be refugees were granted three-year temporary protection visas, under which they could be returned to their places of origin in Afghanistan and Iraq at a time of the government's choosing.\n\nOn 23 May 2004, it was reported that most Afghan asylum seekers on Nauru recently granted refugee status were likely to be resettled in Australia. The Federal Government decided to grant refugee status to 92 Afghans detained on the Pacific island nation, while 11 applications were refused.\n\nHolders of a Temporary Protection Visa were not allowed multiple entrances into Australia and did not have access to the same services as normally recognised refugees (for example, free English language lessons and help with job search). Another small group was later accepted by New Zealand.\n\nThe crew of the \"Tampa\" received the Nansen Refugee Award for 2002 from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for their involvement in the events. Captain Arne Rinnan was also named captain of the year by the shipping newspaper \"Lloyd's List\" and Nautical Institute in London.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "32623616", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32623616", "title": "The Hague Institute for Global Justice", "text": "The Hague Institute for Global Justice\n\nThe Hague Institute for Global Justice, or simply The Hague Institute, was an international think tank based in The Hague, Netherlands. The Institute was established in 2011 by a consortium of partners including the Municipality of The Hague, an academic coalition of Hague-based organizations and with support from the Dutch government. Independent and non-partisan, The Hague Institute focused on interdisciplinary research in three perspectives: conflict prevention, rule of law, and global governance.\n\nAbiodun Williams, former Senior Vice President at the U.S. Institute of Peace and former Director of Strategic Planning for UN Secretaries-General Kofi Annan and Ban Ki-moon, was the president of The Hague Institute.\n\nFormer U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright chaired the Institute’s Advisory Council.\n\nThe Hague Institute worked at the intersection of peace, security and justice and according to its website, “aims to contribute to, and further strengthen, the global framework for preventing and resolving conflict and promoting international peace.”\n\nThe Hague Institute was supported by an Advisory Council who serve as a \"strategic sounding board\" for the president of the Institute. Dr. Abiodun Williams was appointed as the Institute's first president on January 1, 2013. Williams previously served as Senior Vice President of the Center for Conflict Management at the United States Institute of Peace (USIP) in Washington, D.C. He was preceded by Professor Willem van Genugten who served as Interim Dean of the Institute from September 2011 to December 2012. Professor Nico Schrijver, Academic Director of the Grotius Centre for International Legal Studies at Leiden University served as the Institute's first dean between January and August 2011.\n\n\nThe work of The Hague Institute was organized around three programs - Conflict Prevention, Rule of Law, and Global Governance - and covered a wide range of issues including R2P, education and conflict, climate change, water diplomacy, cyber security, mass atrocities, illicit financial flows and the role of institutions and governance such as the International Criminal Court (ICC), transitional justice. According to the Institute's website, The Hague Institute provided policy-relevant research, practitioner training and convenes actors from various areas of expertise to facilitate dialogue and stimulate knowledge sharing.\n\nThe Hague Institute and the Stimson Center, based in Washington, DC gathered \"a select group of eminent statespersons and public intellectuals\" to address global threats and challenges related to fragile states, climate change and the cyber-economy. The Commission, later renamed as the Albright-Gambari Commission, convened consultations online and around the world to facilitate a report which complements the UN Post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals agenda, the UN Peacebuilding Architecture, the Fourth Global Conference on Cyberspace in The Hague, and the UN Conference on Parties on Climate Change in Paris.\n\nThe Hague Approach was intended a flagship project of The Hague Institute. It comprises \"six guiding principles for achieving sustainable peace in post-conflict situations.\" In August 2013, the Institute presented The Hague Approach Principles during the Peace Palace centenary to King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.\n\nThe Global Governance Reform Initiative tackled issues in cyberspace, migration, and oceans. The initiative brings together stakeholders from different sectors (government, civil society, international organizations, and business) and geographical regions to address pressing issues in global governance collectively. A three-day conference titled \"The Future of Cyber Governance\" convened in May 2014 and launched the project.\n\nThe Water Diplomacy Consortium combined expertise from five Netherlands-based organizations to serve as a “global hub” to exchange knowledge and experience in water technology and water governance. The Hague Institute served as the lead partner of the WDC which also includes Netherlands Institute of International Relations Clingendael, Water Governance Centre, UNESCO-IHE Institute for Water Education, and UPEACE.\n\nConsisting of a network of experts and practitioners, the Knowledge Platform focused on building “security and rule of law” in developing countries. The platform was originally launched in late spring 2012 by Ben Knapen, former Dutch State Secretary for European Affairs and International Cooperation. The Hague Institute served as the primary facilitator for the platform’s partners including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands.\n\nThe Institute organized events and conferences to analyze a broad scope of issues related to conflict prevention, transitional justice, global security and international relations. Expert round tables aim to facilitate dialogue and knowledge sharing. The Institute has welcomed Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations Jan Eliasson, Jurist James Crawford, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay, Chief Prosecutor of the ICC Fatou Bensouda and United Nations Special Adviser on the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) Jennifer Welsh. In April 2014, The Hague Institute partnered with the Brookings Institution to organize the first Annual Justice Stephen Breyer Lecture on International Law.\n\nIn November 2013, the Institute launched the \"Distinguished Speaker Series.\" The lecture series invites high-level international experts to discuss topics affecting global progress. Speakers included Joschka Fischer, Jim Stavridis, Jan Peter Balkenende, Edi Rama and Miroslav Lajčák.\n\nTo \"stimulate debate about the current course and future trajectory of Dutch foreign policy\", The Hague Institute gathered leading officials in Dutch government for a series of \"Inside View\" debates focused on the effectiveness of Dutch foreign policy. On September 10, 2013, the series launched with former Dutch political directors from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands exploring the Netherlands' role in international relations, within the EU and at the United Nations. The series continued with former Permanent Representatives to the United Nations on October 24, 2013 and concluded on December 11, 2013 with former Foreign Ministers of the Netherlands addressing present and future challenges of Dutch international relations.\n\nIn June 2014, the Institute, in cooperation with the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC and the National Security Archive at George Washington University, convened 35 officials and eyewitnesses for a multi-day conference on the Rwanda Genocide. The event was based on the 'critical oral history' approach. Participants included Ibrahim Gambari, Henry Kwami Anyidoho, Lord David Hannay, Prudence Bushnell, Michael N. Barnett and Lieutenant-General Roméo Dallaire.\n\nThe Hague Institute's experts and programs produced a variety publications based on research and analysis on a scope of issues affecting global justice. These publications aimed to inform policymakers, academics, experts and the general public. In June 2014, the Institute launched a working paper series to complement its existing publication series of Policy Briefs and Commentaries. The working paper series aimed to \"contribute original research of the highest quality to scholarly and policy debates.\" Working papers addressed just war theory, sanctions against Iran and the relationship between constitutional law and global governance.\n\nIn August 2013, the Institute published \"The Hague Approach Principles,\" six principles for achieving sustainable peace in post-conflict situations, and a comparative study of rule of law efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq titled, \"Promoting the Rule of Law in Peacebuilding: Lessons from Afghanistan and Iraq\". Both publications, based on empirical evidence, were presented at the centennial celebrations of the Peace Palace in The Hague. The Hague Approach Principles have subsequently been endorsed by current and former UN and global leaders including San-Hyun Song, Judy Cheng-Hopkins and Jan Eliasson.\n\nThe Hague Institute produced a biannual magazine called \"Intersections\", which highlighted activities of the Institute and featured columns from public figures working at the intersection of peace, security and global justice issues. Previous contributors to the magazine include, Madeleine Albright, Michael Kirby (judge), Fatou Bensouda and Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert. The magazine was published biannually.\n\nOn January 1, 2013 Abiodun Williams was appointed as the Institute's first president. He was preceded by Professor Willem van Genugten who served as Interim Dean of the Institute from September 2011 to December 2012. In an article by Dutch magazine De Groene Amsterdammer (4th April 2018), sources told the magazine that Williams insisted that the position of 'international dean' had to be restyled as 'president', in addition to a very high financial compensation package in order to lend him greater authority and benefits. The Dutch government granted up to 20 million Euros in subsidies for the Institute. According to staff members, Williams neglected fund raising, and spent considerable amounts of Institute funds on questionable expenses such as first class airfare, 5-star hotel rooms and long taxi rides not visibly related to the Institute's business, a claim confirmed by accounting firms. Furthermore, according to a reconstruction by Dutch newspaper \"de Volkskrant\", Williams spent thousands of euros on expensive lunches at the nearby Carlton Ambassador hotel and first class flights since 'cattle class' was not good enough for him. A senior researcher quoted in the article indicates that there were many clashes between employees and Williams. According to the researcher citied, Williams distanced himself from staff whenever he felt challenged: 'Like it was beneath his dignity to talk to me directly. There was a culture clash. We academics are egalitarian. Though he was very focused on hierarchy and quickly felt criticized.' \n\nReports claim his financial mismanagement eventually led to his departure in December 2016. In 2013, for instance, Williams claimed 10,205.50 Euro for taxi rides, including a short trip of less than a kilometer from his home to the Dutch Parliament in The Hague, which amounted to 321 Euro. On 29 October he also took a cab to Groningen costing 722.25 Euro.\n\nShortly thereafter, another organization based in The Hague, the Center for International Legal Cooperation, considered a 'structural cooperation' out of a sense of responsibility for the loss of the subsidized funds. After viewing the financial documents, the CILC was startled by the 'deplorable situation'. Allegedly, Williams was seen behind the paper shredder for hours before his departure, which documents in question were destroyed is unclear.Anton Nijssen, Williams' close associate for a long time, has been appointed by the Supervisory Board as' liquidator 'who has to take care of' the (financial) handling of cases'. There are numerous creditors, including the former landlord VNG and the Indisch Herinneringscentrum, which last year already moved into the spacious building in The Hague where the last researcher of the Hague Institute for Global Justice left just before Easter. Williams’ mismanagement is said to have been the main reason for the subsequent failure of the institute.\n\nFollowing the reports of the alleged mismanagement, the topic was raised in the Dutch parliament where several political parties posed questions to the Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs and Climate, Eric Wiebes. Willem Moorlag from the Dutch socialist party PvdA asked the minister whether there is any judicial ground to recover the lost funds from Williams and/or the Supervisory Board. The right-wing Forum voor Democratie (FvD) asked the minister why no action was undertaken against Williams when it was already clear after several months that he didn't fulfill his role as funds raiser. Jan Paternotte from the social liberal D66 asked the minister how it was possible that the Institute still received subsidies after a critical report by Price Waterhouse Coopers exposed the financial mismanagement.\n\nIn April 2018, The Hague Institute for Global Justice closed down after becoming insolvent, reportedly caused by poor leadership from President Abiodun Williams, serious mismanagement, and lack of proper oversight of President Williams by the Advisory Board led by Dick Benschop.\n\n"}
{"id": "11613272", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11613272", "title": "Unring the bell", "text": "Unring the bell\n\nIn law, unring the bell is an analogy used to suggest the difficulty of forgetting information once it is known. When discussing jury trials, the phrase is sometimes used to describe the judge's instructions to the jury to ignore inadmissible evidence or statements they have heard. It may also be used if inadmissible evidence has been brought before a jury and the judge subsequently declares a mistrial.\n\nCommenting on Court TV about the pre-trial release of nearly 200 pages of documents from a hearing on the sexual activities of the accuser in the Kobe Bryant sexual assault case, jury consultant Idgi D'Andrea said, \"It's really hard to unring the bell, once that bell has been rung, and ask people to forget what they've heard.\" In a more recent case, judge Reggie Walton said that he could not \"unring the bell\" when he declared a mistrial in the Roger Clemens perjury trial.\n\nOne of the earliest reported legal references to unringing a bell can be found in the Oregon Supreme Court case \"State v. Rader\", 62 Ore. 37; 124 P. 195, argued on May 9, 1912, decided on May 28, 1912.\n\nIn that case, the defendant, Frederick Rader, indicted as Fritz Rader, was tried and convicted of the crime of arson for allegedly burning two haystacks. The prosecution’s theory was that Rader did so in retaliation for the victim’s reporting another crime (that Rader had cut off the tail of one of the victim’s cows). At trial, the victim was permitted to testify concerning Rader's alleged tail-cutting. The court ruled that improper testimony had been admitted and it constituted a reversible error. Chief Justice McBride noted (at p. 40):\nWhile in some cases an express instruction to the jury to disregard testimony injuriously admitted is properly held to cure the error, yet the courts are cautious in the application of this rule. It is not an easy task to unring a bell, nor to remove from the mind an impression once firmly imprinted there, and the withdrawal of the testimony should be so emphatic as to leave no doubt in the mind of the juror as to the unequivocal repudiation by the court of the erroneously admitted matter, and even then, in a case where the testimony is evenly balanced or contradictory, courts hesitate to sanction such withdrawal, though it seems absolutely necessary to permit this course in some instances.\n\nThe phrase also appears several times in the ruling of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in the case USA v Lowis, 174 F.3d 881, 885 (7th Cir. 1999). Gary Lowis was arrested for possession of amphetamine and marijuana. Between that arrest and the subsequent trial, he was arrested a second time on similar charges. Before trial in United States District Court on the first arrest, the judge granted a defense motion to exclude evidence of the second arrest. However, during testimony a police witness quoted a statement made by Lowis after the second arrest. The judge later instructed the jury to disregard that portion of the evidence. \n\nLowis appealed his subsequent conviction, arguing, among other things, that the statements were so prejudicial to him that in spite of the judge's best efforts in instructing the jury to disregard that evidence, as a practical matter it was impossible to \"unring the bell.\" Addressing the evidence admitted in error, the appeals court wrote that that evidence was \"not a very loud bell\" and the judge's instructions to the jury were adequate to \"unring\" it. Lowis' conviction was upheld.\n\nIn its ruling in USA v Lowis, the appeals court provides some background and mentions a few other phrases (citations removed):\n\"Unring the bell\" is a good analogy which can save a lot of words in making the point. That phrase originated, as far as we can find, in Sandez v. United States [1956], and was elaborated on in Dunn v. United States, which added other pertinent analogies. \"After the thrust of the saber it is difficult to forget the wound,\" was another, and then the most colorful one of all, \"If you throw a skunk into the jury box, you can't instruct the jury not to smell it.\" In the present case there was no skunk thrown in the jury box. As also mentioned in Dunn, \"Trials are rarely, if ever, perfect, but gross imperfections should not go unnoticed.\" We find no gross imperfections which would overpower the district court's instruction to the jury to disregard Lowis' statement.\n"}
{"id": "3824030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3824030", "title": "Visiting Forces Act", "text": "Visiting Forces Act\n\nVisiting Forces Act is a title often given to laws governing the status of military personnel while they are visiting within areas under the jurisdiction of another country and/or while forces of one country are attached to or serving with forces of another country.\n\nThe law may also apply to some foreign non-military persons who are associated with visiting military forces (e.g., dependents, civilian employees, etc.). Such laws commonly address such issues as criminal jurisdiction, treatment of apprehended individuals found to be foreign military personnel who are or military deserters, double jeopardy situations, etc. Individual laws enacted by individual governments may address such issues directly, or may act as enabling legislation so that separate visiting forces agreements between a host country and other countries may attain the force of law. Depending on the legislative climate in the host country, such enabling legislation may or may not be necessary.\n\nFollowing are some examples of laws relating to visiting forces in various countries:\n\nThe Visiting Forces Act of 2007 would define the status of foreign forces visiting Antigua and Barbuda). Section 7 of that Act provides that a service court of a visiting force has the primary right to exercise jurisdiction in relation to an alleged commission by a member of the visiting force or a dependent of an offense in respect of (a) the property or security of the designated state; or\n(b) the person or property of another member of the visiting force or a dependent. This act is presently embodied in a bill is pending enactment.\n\nThe Defence (Visiting Forces) Act 1963 is an act to make provision with respect to naval, military and air forces of other countries visiting Australia, and for other purposes.\nSection 6 of this act specifies that it shall be read as a reference to: (a) any country declared by the regulations to be, for the purposes of this Act, a country within the Commonwealth of Nations; and (b) any other country declared under this section to be a country in relation to which that provision has effect.\nSection 5 of the Defence (Visiting Forces) Regulations 1963 specifies a list of specific countries with reference to which the Visiting Forces Act applies.\nSection 8 of the Visiting Forces Act specifies that the service tribunals and service authorities of a country in relation to which this section applies may, within Australia, or on board a ship or aircraft belonging to or in the service of the Defence Force or a part of the Defence Force, exercise over persons subject to their jurisdiction in accordance with this section all such powers as are exercisable by them in accordance with the law of that country.\n\nThe Visiting Forces Act (R.S., 1985, c. V-2) provides that the service authorities and service courts of a visiting force may exercise within Canada in relation to members of that force and dependents all the criminal and disciplinary jurisdiction that is conferred on them by the law of the designated state to which they belong.\n\nThe following agreements govern the presence of forces from NATO states stationed in Germany on the basis of an international treaty:\n\nIn Malaysia, Act 432 is the Visiting Forces Act 1960 (Revised 1990).\n\nIn 2004, the New Zealand Parliament passed the Visiting Forces Act 2004, updating and replacing the Visiting Forces Act 1939.\n\nSingapore's Visiting Forces Act contains provisions for \"the naval, military and air forces of certain other countries visiting Singapore, and for the apprehension and disposal of deserters or absentees without leave in Singapore from the forces of such countries and for matters connected therewith.\"\n\nIn March 2007, the Senate and the House of Representatives passed legislation titled the Visiting Forces Act, 2007.\nSection 5 of the act extends immunity from the civil and criminal jurisdiction of Trinidad and Tobago in respect of actions taken in the course of their official duties.\n\nThe Visiting Forces (British Commonwealth) Act 1933 was an act to make provision with respect to forces of His Majesty from other parts of the British Commonwealth when visiting the United Kingdom or a colony; with respect to the exercise of command and discipline when forces of His Majesty from different parts of the Commonwealth are serving together; with respect to the attachment of members of one such force to another such force, and with respect to deserters from such forces.\n\nDuring World War II, the Allied Forces Act 1940 enabled visiting Allied forces to conduct courts martial, but did not provide immunity from ordinary criminal law. There was a single exception, as the United States of America (Visiting Forces) Act 1942 gave members of the United States naval and military forces immunity in United Kingdom courts. That remained the position until the aforementioned acts were repealed by the Visiting Forces Act 1952.\n\nThe Visiting Forces Act 1952 was passed to incorporate the provisions of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement into United Kingdom law. SOFA provides a basis for a mutual and reciprocal system of exemptions, immunities and privileges for visiting forces when exercising or stationed in a host country. A major feature of SOFA, which is implemented by the 1952 Act, is the question of jurisdiction for dealing with offences committed by visiting servicemen, civil servants accompanying a force, dependents and contractors. Its main provision is the agreement that the visiting force will retain jurisdiction for its people, which applies equally to United States personnel based in the United Kingdom and British forces serving in NATO countries, Commonwealth countries and, more recently, those countries that have signed up to the NATO partnership for peace. Usually, the service authorities for the visiting force member alleged to have committed an offence and the United Kingdom authorities will be able to agree which jurisdiction is appropriate to deal with the case. If agreement is not reached the decision as to jurisdiction will be referred to the Crown Prosecution Service. Where United Kingdom jurisdiction is appropriate the visiting forces case will normally be dealt with locally unless other criteria require the case to be dealt with by Crown Prosecution Service headquarters. Section 1 of the Visiting Forces Act 1952 contains a list of countries to which the act applies. Subsection 2 of Section 1, along with Subsection 2 of Section 15 provide the authority and a means for extending this list.\nVisiting Forces (Designation) Order 1997 and 1998 extended this list by designation additional countries.\n\nStatutory Instrument 1990 No. 24 extends the provisions of the British Visiting Forces Act 1952 to these territories.\n\nStatutory Instrument 2001 No. 3922 extends the provisions of the British Visiting Forces Act 1952 to Bermuda.\n\nOn 14 August 1980, the Republic of Vanuatu enacted the Visiting forces (Agreement) Act. This act gives separate Visiting Forces Agreements with and Papua New Guinea and with the United Kingdom, and specified a protocol for extending those agreements.\n\n"}
