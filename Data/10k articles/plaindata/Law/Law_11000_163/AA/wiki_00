This crisis was started by a group of politicians who were dissatisfied towards Stephen Kalong Ningkan's leadership as chief minister. Ningkan was later removed from the chief minister post by the Governor of Sarawak in June 1966. However, Ningkan was reinstated by the High Court in early September 1966. He was ousted from the chief minister office for the final time at the end of September 1966 and was replaced by Tawi Sli as the new chief minister. It was widely believed that the ouster of Ningkan was a result of interference by the Malaysian federal government due to him being a strong advocate of greater state autonomy.\n\nOn 22 July 1963, Stephen Kalong Ningkan was appointed as the first chief minister of Sarawak following his landslide winnings of the 1963 local council elections. In 1965, Ningkan tried to initiate a land reform law that would allow the natives to acquire full title to Native Customary land. Therefore, the natives would be able to sell their land to anyone including the Chinese. Such a law would also allow the natives to acquire large tracts of forest land. Ningkan's action angered the leaders in Barisan Rakyat Jati Sarawak (BARJASA) party. Subsequently, Sarawak Native Alliance consisting of Parti Negara Sarawak (PANAS), BARJASA party, and Parti Pesaka Sarawak (PESAKA) was formed in order to challenge Ningkan's leadership. On 13 June 1966, Ningkan sacked Abdul Taib Mahmud (a BARJASA leader) from the post of Minister of Communication and Works.\n\nOn 16 June 1966, 21 out of 42 members of the state legislature declared that they did not have confidence in Stephen Kalong Ningkan. The 21 assemblymen wrote a petition to the Governor of Sarawak stating that they have lost confidence in the chief minister. The prime minister of Malaysia, Tunku Abdul Rahman also advocated the petition and asked Ningkan to resign.\n\nOn the same day, the Governor, Abang Haji Openg, at the insistence of the federal government in Kuala Lumpur, requested Ningkan to resign from the post. However, Ningkan refused to resign from the cabinet. Ningkan argued that the letter has not been supported by a formal motion of no confidence against him at the Council Negri (now Sarawak State Legislative Assembly). He also demanded the names of all the 21 Council Negri members who signed the petition. Ningkan also claimed that he still commanded a majority of the state assembly members and challenged his dissidents into a formal debate of motion of no confidence in the Council Negeri. Since Ningkan refused to resign, the governor then declared that Ningkan has ceased to hold office and appointed Tawi Sli as the new chief minister. The Governor also forwarded the names who had signed the petition to Ningkan.\n\nFollowing the ouster, Ningkan decided bring the case into Kuching High Court and named the Governor as the first defendant and Tawi Sli as the second defendant. On 7 September 1966, Chief Justice of Borneo, Justice Harley, delivered a verdict that reinstated Ningkan back to his chief minister post. According to Section 21 of the Interpretation Ordinance of the Sarawak state constitution, only the Council Negri has the power to appoint or dismiss a chief minister. The Governor does not have the power to dismiss a chief minister. However, chief minister can only be dismissed if he had lost the confidence of Council Negri or he refused to resign from the chief minister post but he also failed to advise a dissolution of the Council Negri.\n\nFollowing the court's decision, Ningkan tried to initiate a dissolution of Council Negri so that he could seek a fresh mandate from the voters. However, in September 1966, the federal government declared a state of emergency in Sarawak, citing chaos in the state. Through the Emergency (Federal Constitution and the Constitution of Sarawak) Act, an amendment was made to Article 150 of the Sarawak constitution. Such amendment authorised the Governor of Sarawak to convene a Council Negri meeting without going through the chief minister. A Council Negri meeting was commenced on 23 September 1966 and Ningkan was successfully removed from the chief minister post.\n\nNingkan decided to bring the case to Federal Court of Malaysia after his second ouster. Ningkan also tried to seek legal advice from the British government about Britain's role in setting the conditions of Sarawak entering Malaysia and the signing of the London's agreement on behalf of Sarawak. Ningkan also argued that the Sarawak constitutional amendment was illegal because the state of emergency was declared under unusual circumstances. There was no riots or disturbances taking place in Sarawak. Furthermore, Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation was already over in August 1966. However, the federal court held that the word \"emergency\" has a broad meaning and it would also include the Sarawak constitutional crisis because such a crisis would cause a breakdown in the Sarawak state government and harm the political stability in Sarawak. Therefore, such declaration of emergency in Sarawak is legal. On 1 August 1968, Judicial Committee of the Privy Council dismissed Ningkan's appeal. MacDermott stated that, \"their Lordships could not find any reason for saying that the emergency was not grave and did not threaten the security of Sarawak.\"\n"}

It is part of the criminal procedure in some jurisdictions using common law.\n\nAn allocution allows the defendant to explain why the sentence should be lenient. In plea bargains, an allocution may be required of the defendant. The defendant explicitly admits specifically and in detail the actions and their reasons in exchange for a reduced sentence.\n\nIn principle, that removes any doubt as to the exact nature of the defendant's guilt in the matter.\n\nThe term \"allocution\" is used generally only in jurisdictions in the United States, but there are vaguely similar processes in other common law countries. In many other jurisdictions, it is for the defense lawyer to mitigate on his client's behalf, and the defendant rarely has the opportunity to speak.\n\nThe right of victims to speak at sentencing is also sometimes referred to as allocution.\n\nIn Australia, the term \"allocutus\" is used by the Clerk of Arraigns or another formal associate of the Court. It is generally phrased as, \"Prisoner at the Bar, you have been found Guilty by a jury of your peers of the offense of XYZ. Do you have anything to say as to why the sentence of this Court should not now be passed upon you?\" The defense counsel will then make a \"plea in mitigation\" (also called \"submissions on penalty\") in an attempt to mitigate the relative seriousness of the offense and heavily refer to and rely upon the defendant's previous good character and good works, if any.\n\nThe right to make a plea in mitigation is absolute. If a judge or magistrate refuses to hear such a plea or does not properly consider it, the sentence can be overturned on appeal.\n\nIn most of the United States, defendants are allowed the opportunity to allocute before a sentence is passed. Some jurisdictions hold that as an absolute right. In its absence, a sentence but not the conviction may be overturned, resulting in the need for a new sentencing hearing. In the federal system, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(i)(4) provides that the court must \"address the defendant personally in order to permit the defendant to speak or present any information to mitigate the sentence.\"\n\nThe Federal Public Defender recommends that defendants speak in terms of how a lenient sentence will be sufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with the statutory directives set forth in .\n\n"}

The primary difference between alternating custody and joint custody is that in some nations, under an alternating custody arrangement the parent that currently has the child also retains sole authority over the child/children for the duration that the child/children are with said parent. The general reason for using this arrangement rather than a more commonly used arrangement is that the parents tend to live too far away from each other to allow for other arrangements to be feasible.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "57387107", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57387107", "title": "Australian corporate tax rate", "text": "Australian corporate tax rate\n\nThe Australian company tax rate has varied over time. It has been a flat rate and reached its peak of 49%. Before 1987, Australia had the classical dividend taxation system, whereby a company's profit would be taxed at the company tax rate and a shareholder would be taxed on a dividend received, giving raise to what is described as double taxation. In 1987, the Australian dividend imputation system was introduced to stop the double taxation, and to create a \"level playing field\". The company tax rate was reduced to 39% in 1988 and 33% in 1993, and increased again in 1995 to 36%, to be reduced to 34% in 2000 and 30% in 2001. \n\nFrom 2015/16, designated \"small business entities\" with an aggregated annual turnover threshold of less than $2 million were eligible for a lower tax rate of 28.5%. Since 1 July 2016, small business entities with aggregated annual turnover of less than $10 million have had a reduced company tax rate of 27.5%. Additionally, the Australian Government announced that from 2017/18, corporate entities eligible for the lower tax rate will be known as \"base rate entities\". The small business definition will remain at $10 million from 2017/18 onwards, however the base rate entity threshold (the aggregated annual turnover threshold under which entities will be eligible to pay a lower tax rate) will continue to rise.\n\nAustralia introduced a dividend imputation system in 1987, making the company tax rate less relevant, especially on company profits distributed to Australian-resident shareholders in the form of franked dividends.\n\nAustralian companies that have paid Australian company tax can declare how much of the tax paid is to be imputed or associated with any dividend it pays. Dividends with the maximum imputed tax amount is called a franked dividend, while any other dividend is unfranked. Australian-resident shareholders who receive franked dividends from Australian companies would declare both the dividends and the imputation credits on their tax returns, but are entitled to claim back a tax credit (called a franking credit) on those imputed tax credits. The franking credits associated with such dividends are a tax credit against the shareholder's tax liability. Initially, in 1987, excess franking credits over the tax liability were lost, but since 2000 such excess credits have been refundable. Effectively, the Australian shareholder receives a reimbursement of the company tax paid, and the company profit is taxed at the shareholders’ marginal tax rates. Company profits not distributed are taxed at the company tax rate, until such retained profits are distributed.\n\nNon-resident shareholders are not entitled to claim a tax credit or refund of imputation credits. Unfranked dividends received by non-residents are subject to a withholding tax, which does not apply to franked dividends.\n\nIn the May 2016 budget, the Turnbull government outlined company tax cuts. The small to medium business tax rate would be lowered by 1% to 27.5%, effective 1 July 2016. The turnover threshold in which small businesses would be eligible for this lower tax rate would raise from $2 million to $10 million, with the expectation that it would be raised again to $25 million in 2017–18, $50 million in 2018–19, and eventually $100 million in 2019–20. It is expected this tax cut will affect over 870,000 businesses, employing 3.4 million workers. Over 6,000 Sole traders, employing 1.5 million workers, will also receive a lower tax cut of 2.5% to 26.0%, subject to the same turnover threshold eligibility as small businesses and along with the same increase in turnover threshold over time. The unincorporated small business tax discount will also be increased by 3%, up to a fixed rate of 8%, with the turnover threshold being increased to $5 million. After 2016–17, it is expected that the discount for unincorporated small businesses will increase to 16% by stages, before the 2026-27 financial year. In the forecast for the budget, Big businesses will receive a 5% cut to the corporate income tax rate, down to the OECD average of 25%, within a decade; the first reduction in the corporate tax rate in 15 years. While the rate will stay fixed at 30% in the meantime, the Turnbull Government plans to reduce it to a rate equal to the small and medium business tax rate of 27.5% in 2023-24, before being reduced to 27% in 2024-25, 26% in 2025-26, and eventually a fixed rate of 25% in 2026-27.\n\nAs at May 2018, the government had legislated the first phase of the plan, giving tax cuts to companies with turnover of up to $50 million at a cost of $29.8 billion over the first decade. The second phase, costing another $35.6 billion over the same period, has already been blocked in the Senate.\n"}
{"id": "23278125", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23278125", "title": "Bullfighting", "text": "Bullfighting\n\nBullfighting is a physical contest that involves humans and animals attempting to publicly subdue, immobilise, or kill a bull, usually according to a set of rules, guidelines, or cultural expectations. There are many different forms and varieties in various locations around the world. Some forms involve dancing around or over a cow or bull, or attempting to grasp an object from the animal.\n\nThe best-known form of bullfighting is Spanish-style bullfighting, a traditional spectacle in countries including Spain, Portugal, parts of southern France, and some Latin American countries (Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela and Peru). While some forms are sometimes considered to be a blood sport, in some countries, for example Spain, it is defined as an art form or cultural event and relevant regulatory frameworks liken it to other cultural events and heritage. In Spain, \"toreros\" (see Bullfighter) are almost as popular as football stars, often supported by sponsors and appearing in press. A particular breed of cattle, the Spanish Fighting Bull, is used for this type of bullfighting. These bulls must be bred in large ranches, and in conditions as similar as possible to the way they would live in the wild.\n\nThere are many historic fighting venues in the Iberian Peninsula, France, and Latin America. The largest venue of its kind is the Plaza México in central Mexico City, which seats 48,000 people, and the oldest are the Plazas of Béjar and Ronda, in the Spanish provinces of Salamanca and Málaga. All the bullrings have a complex pricing system, main factors being the sun and shadow, proximity to the action, and experience levels of \"torero\".\n\nThe practice of bullfighting is controversial because of a range of concerns including animal welfare, funding, and religion. Bullfighting is illegal in most countries, but remains legal in most areas of Spain and Portugal, as well as in some Hispanic American countries and some parts of southern France.\nBullfighting traces its roots to prehistoric bull worship and sacrifice in Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean region. The first recorded bullfight may be the \"Epic of Gilgamesh,\" which describes a scene in which Gilgamesh and Enkidu fought and killed the Bull of Heaven (\"The Bull seemed indestructible, for hours they fought, till Gilgamesh dancing in front of the Bull, lured it with his tunic and bright weapons, and Enkidu thrust his sword, deep into the Bull's neck, and killed it\"). Bull leaping was portrayed in Crete, and myths related to bulls throughout Greece. The killing of the sacred bull (tauroctony) is the essential central iconic act of Mithras, which was commemorated in the mithraeum wherever Roman soldiers were stationed. The oldest representation of what seems to be a man facing a bull is on the Celtiberian tombstone from Clunia and the cave painting \"El toro de hachos\", both found in Spain.\n\nBullfighting is often linked to Rome, where many human-versus-animal events were held as competition and entertainment, the \"Venationes\". These hunting games spread to Africa, Europe and Asia during Roman times. There are also theories that it was introduced into Hispania by the Emperor Claudius, as a substitute for gladiators, when he instituted a short-lived ban on gladiatorial combat. The latter theory was supported by Robert Graves (picadors are related to warriors who wielded the javelin, but their role in the contest is now a minor one limited to \"preparing\" the bull for the matador.) Spanish colonists took the practice of breeding cattle and bullfighting to the American colonies, the Pacific and Asia. In the 19th century, areas of southern and southwestern France adopted bullfighting, developing their own distinctive form.\nReligious festivities and royal weddings were celebrated by fights in the local plaza, where noblemen would ride competing for royal favor, and the populace enjoyed the excitement. In the Middle Ages across Europe, knights would joust in competitions on horseback. In Spain, they began to fight bulls.\n\nIn medieval Spain bullfighting was considered a noble sport and reserved to the rich, who could afford to supply and train their animals. The bull was released into a closed arena where a single fighter on horseback was armed with a lance. This spectacle was said to be enjoyed by Charlemagne, Alfonso X the Wise and the Almohad caliphs, among others. The greatest Spanish performer of this art is said to have been the knight El Cid. According to a chronicle of the time, in 1128 \"... when Alfonso VII of León and Castile married Berengaria of Barcelona daughter of Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona at Saldaña among other celebrations, there were also bullfights.\"\n\nIn the time of Emperor Charles V, Pedro Ponce de Leon was the most famous bullfighter in Spain and a renovator of the technique of killing the bull on a horse with blindfolded eyes. Juan de Quirós, the best Sevillian poet of that time, dedicated to him a poem in Latin, of which Benito Arias Montano transmits some verses.\n\nFrancisco Romero, from Ronda, Spain, is generally regarded as having been the first to introduce the practice of fighting bulls on foot around 1726, using the muleta in the last stage of the fight and an estoc to kill the bull. This type of fighting drew more attention from the crowds. Thus the modern \"corrida\", or fight, began to take form, as riding noblemen were replaced by commoners on foot. This new style prompted the construction of dedicated bullrings, initially square, like the \"Plaza de Armas\", and later round, to discourage the cornering of the action.\n\nThe modern style of Spanish bullfighting is credited to Juan Belmonte, generally considered the greatest matador of all time. Belmonte introduced a daring and revolutionary style, in which he stayed within a few centimetres of the bull throughout the fight. Although extremely dangerous (Belmonte was gored on many occasions), his style is still seen by most matadors as the ideal to be emulated.\n\nOriginally, at least five distinct regional styles of bullfighting were practised in southwestern Europe: Andalusia, Aragon–Navarre, Alentejo, Camargue, Aquitaine. Over time, these have evolved more or less into standardized national forms mentioned below. The \"classic\" style of bullfight, in which the bull is killed, is the form practiced in Spain and many Latin American countries.\n\nSpanish-style bullfighting is called \"corrida de toros\" (literally \"coursing of bulls\") or \"la fiesta\" (\"the festival\"). In the traditional corrida, three \"matadores\" each fight two bulls, each of which is between four and six years old and weighs no less than 460 kg (1,014 lb) Each matador has six assistants—two \"picadores\" (lancers on horseback) mounted on horseback, three \"banderilleros\" – who along with the matadors are collectively known as \"toreros\" (bullfighters) – and a \"mozo de espadas\" (sword page). Collectively they comprise a \"cuadrilla\" (entourage). In Spanish the more general \"torero\" or \"diestro\" (literally 'right-hander') is used for the lead fighter, and only when needed to distinguish a man is the full title \"matador de toros\" used; in English, \"matador\" is generally used for the bullfighter.\n\nThe modern corrida is highly ritualized, with three distinct stages or \"tercios\" (\"thirds\"); the start of each being announced by a bugle sound. The participants enter the arena in a parade, called the \"paseíllo\", to salute the presiding dignitary, accompanied by band music. Torero costumes are inspired by 17th-century Andalusian clothing, and matadores are easily distinguished by the gold of their \"traje de luces\" (\"suit of lights\"), as opposed to the lesser banderilleros, who are also known as \"toreros de plata\" (\"bullfighters of silver\").\n\nThe bull is released into the ring, where he is tested for ferocity by the \"matador\" and \"banderilleros\" with the magenta and gold \"capote\" (\"cape\"). This is the first stage, the \"tercio de varas\" (\"the lancing third\"). The matador confronts the bull with the capote, performing a series of passes and observing the behavior and quirks of the bull.\n\nNext, a picador enters the arena on horseback armed with a \"vara\" (lance). To protect the horse from the bull's horns, the animal wears a protective, padded covering called \"peto\". Prior to 1930, the horses did not wear any protection. Often the bull would disembowel the horse during this stage. Until the use of protection was instituted, the number of horses killed during a fiesta generally exceeded the number of bulls killed.\n\nAt this point, the picador stabs just behind the \"morrillo\", a mound of muscle on the fighting bull's neck, weakening the neck muscles and leading to the animal's first loss of blood. The manner in which the bull charges the horse provides important clues to the matador about the bull such as which horn the bull favors. As a result of the injury and also the fatigue of striving to injure the armoured heavy horse, the bull holds its head and horns slightly lower during the following stages of the fight. This ultimately enables the matador to perform the killing thrust later in the performance. The encounter with the picador often fundamentally changes the behaviour of a bull; distracted and unengaging bulls will become more focused and stay on a single target instead of charging at everything that moves, conserving their diminished energy reserves.\n\nIn the next stage, the \"tercio de banderillas\" (\"the third of banderillas\"), each of the three banderilleros attempts to plant two \"banderillas\", sharp barbed sticks, into the bull's shoulders. These anger and agitate the bull reinvigorating him from the \"aplomado\" (literally 'leadened') state his attacks on the horse and injuries from the lance left him in. Sometimes a matador will place his own banderillas. If so, he usually embellishes this part of his performance and employs more varied manoeuvres than the standard \"al cuarteo\" method commonly used by banderilleros.\n\nIn the final stage, the \"tercio de muerte\" (\"the third of death\"), the matador re-enters the ring alone with a smaller red cloth, or \"muleta\", and a sword. It is a common misconception that the color red is supposed to anger the bull; the animals are functionally colorblind in this respect: the bull is incited to charge by the movement of the muleta. The muleta is thought to be red to mask the bull's blood, although the color is now a matter of tradition. The matador uses his muleta to attract the bull in a series of passes, which serve the dual purpose of wearing the animal down for the kill and creating sculptural forms between man in animal that can fascinate or thrill the audience, and which when linked together in a rhythm create a dance of passes, or \"faena\". The matador will often try to enhance the drama of the dance by bringing the bull's horns especially close to his body. The faena refers to the entire performance with the muleta.\n\nThe faena is usually broken down into \"tandas\", or \"series\", of passes. The faena ends with a final series of passes in which the matador, using the cape, tries to maneuver the bull into a position to stab it between the shoulder blades going over the horns and thus exposing his own body to the bull. The sword is called \"estoque,\" and the act of thrusting the sword is called an \"estocada\". During the initial series, while the matador in part is performing for the crowd, he uses a fake sword (\"estoque simulado\"). This is made of wood or aluminum, making it lighter and much easier to handle. The \"estoque de verdad\" (real sword) is made out of steel. At the end of the tercio de muerte, when the matador has finished his faena, he will change swords to take up the steel one. He performs the estocada with the intent of piercing the heart of aorta or severing other major blood vessels to induce a quick death, if all goes according to plan. Often this does not happen and repeated efforts must be made to bring the bull down, sometimes the matador changing to the 'descabello', which resembles a sword, but is actually a heavy dagger blade at the end of a steel rod which is thrust between the cervical vertebrae to sever the spinal column and induce instant death. Even if the descabello is not required and the bull falls quickly from the sword one of the banderilleros will perform this function with an actual dagger to ensure the bull is dead. \n\nIf the matador has performed particularly well, the crowd may petition the president by waving white handkerchiefs to award the matador an ear of the bull. If his performance was exceptional, the president will award two ears. In certain more rural rings, the practice includes an award of the bull's tail. Very rarely, if the public and the matador believe that the bull has fought extremely bravely - and the breeder of the bull agrees to have it return to the ranch - the event's president may grant the bull a pardon (\"indulto\"). If the indulto is granted, the bull's life is spared; it leaves the ring alive and is returned to its home ranch for treatment and then to become a \"semental\", or seed-bull, for the rest its life.\n\nRecortes, a style of bullfighting practiced in Navarre, La Rioja, north of Castile and Valencia, has been much less popular than the traditional corridas. But recortes have undergone a revival in Spain and are sometimes broadcast on TV.\n\nThis style was common in the early 19th century. Etchings by painter Francisco de Goya depict these events.\n\nRecortes differ from a corrida in the following ways:\n\nSince horses are not used, and performers are not professionals, recortes are less costly to produce.\n\nComical spectacles based on bullfighting, called \"espectáculos cómico-taurinos\" or \"charlotadas\", are still popular in Spain and Mexico. Troupes include \"El empastre\" or \"El bombero torero\".\n\nAn \"encierro\" or \"running of the bulls\" is an activity related to a bullfighting fiesta. Before the events that are held in the ring, people (usually young men) run in front of a small group of bulls that have been let loose, on a course of a sectioned-off subset of a town's streets.\n\nA \"toro embolado\" (in Spanish), \"bou embolat\" (in Catalan), roughly meaning \"bull with balls\", is a festive activity held at night and typical of many towns in Spain (mainly in the Valencian Community and Southern Catalonia). Balls of flammable material are attached to a bull's horns. The balls are lit and the bull is set free in the streets at night; participants dodge the bull when it comes close. It can be considered a variant of an \"encierro\" (\"correbous\" in Catalan). This activity is held in a number of Spanish towns during their local festivals. In recent years, animal welfare activists have tried to stop the practice because of cruelty to the animal.\n\nMost Portuguese bullfights are held in two phases: the spectacle of the \"cavaleiro\", and the \"pega\". In the \"cavaleiro\", a horseman on a Portuguese Lusitano horse (specially trained for the fights) fights the bull from horseback. The purpose of this fight is to stab three or four \"bandeiras\" (small javelins) into the back of the bull.\n\nIn the second stage, called the \"pega\" (\"holding\"), the forcados, a group of eight men, challenge the bull directly without any protection or weapon of defence. The front man provokes the bull into a charge to perform a \"pega de cara\" or \"pega de caras\" (face grab). The front man secures the animal's head and is quickly aided by his fellows who surround and secure the animal until he is subdued. Forcados are dressed in a traditional costume of damask or velvet, with long knitted hats as worn by the \"campinos\" (bull headers) from Ribatejo.\n\nThe bull is not killed in the ring and, at the end of the \"corrida\", leading oxen are let into the arena and two \"campinos\" on foot herd the bull among them back to its pen. The bull is usually killed out of sight of the audience by a professional butcher. It can happen that some bulls, after an exceptional performance, are healed, released to pasture until the end of their days and used for breeding.\n\nIn the Portuguese Azores islands, there is a form of bullfighting called \"tourada à corda\", in which a bull is led on a rope along a street, while players taunt and dodge the bull, who is not killed during or after the fight, but returned to pasture and used in later events.\n\nSince the 19th century, Spanish-style \"corridas\" have been increasingly popular in Southern France where they enjoy legal protection in areas where there is an uninterrupted tradition of such bull fights, particularly during holidays such as Whitsun or Easter. Among France's most important venues for bullfighting are the ancient Roman arenas of Nîmes and Arles, although there are bull rings across the South from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic coasts. Bullfights of this kind follow the Spanish tradition and even Spanish words are used for all Bullfighting related terms. Minor cosmetic differences exist such as music. This is not to be confused with the bloodless bullfights referred to below which are indigenous to France.\n\nA more indigenous genre of bullfighting is widely common in the Provence and Languedoc areas, and is known alternately as \"\"course libre\" or \"course camarguaise\"\". This is a bloodless spectacle (for the bulls) in which the objective is to snatch a rosette from the head of a young bull. The participants, or \"raseteurs\", begin training in their early teens against young bulls from the Camargue region of Provence before graduating to regular contests held principally in Arles and Nîmes but also in other Provençal and Languedoc towns and villages. Before the \"course\", an \"abrivado\"—a \"running\" of the bulls in the streets—takes place, in which young men compete to outrun the charging bulls. The \"course\" itself takes place in a small (often portable) arena erected in a town square. For a period of about 15–20 minutes, the \"raseteurs\" compete to snatch rosettes (\"cocarde\") tied between the bulls' horns. They do not take the rosette with their bare hands but with a claw-shaped metal instrument called a \"raset\" or \"crochet\" (\"hook\") in their hands, hence their name. Afterwards, the bulls are herded back to their pen by \"gardians\" (Camarguais cowboys) in a \"bandido\", amidst a great deal of ceremony. The stars of these spectacles are the bulls.\n\nAnother type of French 'bullfighting' is the \"course landaise\", in which cows are used instead of bulls. This is a competition between teams named \"cuadrillas\", which belong to certain breeding estates. A cuadrilla is made up of a \"teneur de corde\", an \"entraîneur\", a \"sauteur\", and six \"écarteurs\". The cows are brought to the arena in crates and then taken out in order. The teneur de corde controls the dangling rope attached to the cow's horns and the entraîneur positions the cow to face and attack the player. The écarteurs will try, at the last possible moment, to dodge around the cow and the sauteur will leap over it. Each team aims to complete a set of at least one hundred dodges and eight leaps. This is the main scheme of the \"classic\" form, the \"course landaise formelle\". However, different rules may be applied in some competitions. For example, competitions for Coupe Jeannot Lafittau are arranged with cows without ropes.\n\nAt one point, it resulted in so many fatalities that the French government tried to ban it, but had to back down in the face of local opposition. The bulls themselves are generally fairly small, much less imposing than the adult bulls employed in the \"corrida\". Nonetheless, the bulls remain dangerous due to their mobility and vertically formed horns. Participants and spectators share the risk; it is not unknown for angry bulls to smash their way through barriers and charge the surrounding crowd of spectators. The \"course landaise\" is not seen as a dangerous sport by many, but écarteur Jean-Pierre Rachou died in 2003 when a bull's horn tore his femoral artery.\n\nJallikattu is a traditional spectacle played in Tamil Nadu, India as a part of Pongal celebrations on Mattu Pongal day. Bos indicus bulls are bred specifically for the sporting event and a specific breed of cattle bred for this purpose is known as \"Jellicut\". During jallikattu, a bull is released into a group of people, and participants attempt to grab the bull's hump and hold onto it for a determined distance, length of time, or with the goal of taking a pack of money tied to the bull's horns.\n\nFreestyle bullfighting is a style of bullfighting developed in American rodeo. The style was developed by the rodeo clowns who protect bull riders from being trampled or gored by an angry bull. Freestyle bullfighting is a 70-second competition in which the bullfighter (rodeo clown) avoids the bull by means of dodging, jumping and use of a barrel.\nCompetitions are organized in the US as the World Bullfighting Championship (WBC) and the Dickies National Bullfighting Championship under auspices of the Professional Bull Riders (PBR).\n\nA distinct type of bloodless bullfighting is practised in California's Central Valley. In this historically Portuguese-settled area, a form of bullfight has developed in which the bull is taunted by a matador, but the lances are tipped with Hook and loop fasteners (e.g. Velcro) and aimed at similar patches secured to the bull's shoulder. Fights occur from May through October around traditional Portuguese holidays.\n\nBullfighting was introduced by the Portuguese to Zanzibar and to Pemba Island, in modern Tanzania, where it is known as \"mchezo wa ngombe\". Similar to the Portuguese Azorean \"tourada a corda\", the bull is restrained by a rope, generally neither bull nor player is harmed, and the bull is not killed at the end of the fight.\n\n\"Bull wrestling\", or \"bull fighting\", is a bloodsport between bulls found in some parts of the world, such as in India (known as \"dhirio\"), Japan (\"tōgyū\"), Balkans (\"korida\"), Turkey (\"boğa güreşi\", literally \"bull wrestling\"), Persian Gulf, and Southeast Asia, in which the bulls lock horns (under varied rules). This form of bullfighting is also practiced in western Kenya.\n\nSpanish-style bullfighting is normally fatal for the bull, but it is also dangerous for the matador. Danger for the bullfighter is essential; if there is no danger, it is not considered bullfighting in Spain. Matadors are usually gored every season, with picadors and banderilleros being gored less often. With the discovery of antibiotics and advances in surgical techniques, fatalities are now rare, although over the past three centuries 534 professional bullfighters have died in the ring or from injuries sustained there. Most recently, Iván Fandiño died of injuries he sustained after being gored by a bull on June 17, 2017 in Aire-sur-l'Adour, France.\n\nSome matadors, notably Juan Belmonte, have been seriously gored many times: according to Ernest Hemingway, Belmonte's legs were marred by many ugly scars. A special type of surgeon has developed, in Spain and elsewhere, to treat \"cornadas\", or horn-wounds.\n\nThe bullring has a chapel where a matador can pray before the corrida, and where a priest can be found in case a sacrament is needed. The most relevant sacrament is now called \"Anointing of the Sick\"; it was formerly known as \"Extreme Unction\", or the \"Last Rites\".\n\nThe media often reports the more horrific of bullfighting injuries, such as the September 2011 goring of matador Juan José Padilla's head by a bull in Zaragoza, resulting in the loss of his left eye, use of his right ear, and facial paralysis. He returned to bullfighting five months later with an eyepatch, multiple titanium plates in his skull, and the nickname 'The Pirate'.\n\nUp through the early twentieth century, the horses were unprotected and were commonly gored and killed, or left close to death (intestines destroyed, for example). The horses used were old and worn-out, with little value. Starting in the twentieth century horses were protected by thick blankets and wounds, though not unknown, were less common and less serious.\n\nMany supporters of bullfighting regard it as a deeply ingrained, integral part of their national cultures; in Spain it is called \"La fiesta nacional\", literally \"the national festival\". The aesthetic of bullfighting is based on the interaction of the man and the bull. Rather than a competitive sport, the bullfight is more of a ritual of ancient origin, which is judged by \"aficionados\" based on artistic impression and command. Ernest Hemingway said of it in his 1932 non-fiction book \"Death in the Afternoon\": \"Bullfighting is the only art in which the artist is in danger of death and in which the degree of brilliance in the performance is left to the fighter's honour.\" Bullfighting is seen as a symbol of Spanish culture.\n\nThe bullfight is regarded as a demonstration of style, technique and courage by its participants and as a demonstration of cruelty and cowardice by its critics. While there is usually no doubt about the outcome, the bull is not viewed by bullfighting supporters as a sacrificial victim — it is instead seen by the audience as a worthy adversary, deserving of respect in its own right.\n\nThose who oppose bullfighting maintain that the practice is a cowardly, sadistic tradition of torturing, humiliating and killing a bull amidst pomp and pageantry. Supporters of bullfights, called \"aficionados\", claim they respect the bulls, that the bulls live better than other cattle, and that bullfighting is a grand tradition; a form of art important to their culture.\n\nConchita Cintron was a Peruvian female bullfighter, perhaps the most famous in the history of bullfighting.\n\nPatricia McCormick began bullfighting as a professional \"Matadora\" in January 1952, and was the first American to do so. Bette Ford was the first American woman to fight on foot in the Plaza México, the world's largest bullfight arena.\n\nIn 1974, Angela Hernandez (also known as Angela Hernandez Gomez and just Angela), of Spain, won a case in the Spanish Supreme Court allowing women to be bullfighters in Spain; a prohibition against women doing so was put in place in Spain in 1908.\nCristina Sánchez de Pablos, of Spain, was one of the first female bullfighters to gain prominence; she debuted as a bullfighter in Madrid on 13 February 1993.\n\nIn Spain, opposition to bullfighting is referred to as the \"antitaurino\" movement. Supporters of a ban on bullfighting remain a minority in Spain. About 30% of Spaniards actively follow bullfighting in Spain. Despite its slow decrease in popularity among younger generations, it remains a widespread cultural activity with millions of followers throughout the country. Polls have had mixed results over the years with wide fluctuations, although the last large poll done by the Spanish newspaper \"El Pais\" suggested only 37% of Spanish were fans of the spectacle, although other polls have also said 57% were against banning it.\n\nMany people, including animal rights and animal welfare advocates, consider this a cruel, barbaric blood sport in which the bull suffers severe stress, and may ultimately end in a slow, torturous death. A number of animal rights and animal welfare groups undertake anti-bullfighting actions in Spain and other countries.\n\nRSPCA assistant director for public affairs, David Bowles, said: \"The RSPCA is strongly opposed to bullfighting. It is an inhumane and outdated practice that continues to lose support, including from those living in the countries where this takes place such as Spain, Portugal and France.\"\n\nBullfighting guide \"The Bulletpoint Bullfight\" warns that bullfighting is \"not for the squeamish\", advising spectators to \"Be prepared for blood.\" The guide details prolonged and profuse bleeding caused by horse-mounted lancers; the charging by the bull of a blindfolded, armored horse who is \"sometimes doped up, and unaware of the proximity of the bull\"; the placing of barbed darts by banderilleros; followed by the matador's fatal sword thrust. The guide stresses that these procedures are a normal part of bullfighting and that death is rarely instantaneous. The guide further warns those attending bullfights to \"Be prepared to witness various failed attempts at killing the animal before it lies down.\"\n\nAlexander Fiske-Harrison, along with other defenders of bullfighting, has argued that the fact that the bull lives three times as long as other cattle used for meat - the meat of the fighting bull also enters the food chain - and is reared wild in meadow and forest should be considered when weighing its impact on animal welfare. Also that the adrenalizing nature of the 30 minute spectacle (per bull) for the animal may arguably reduce the suffering even below that of the stress and anxiety of queuing in the abattoir.\n\nGoing beyond arguments about its historical and cultural significance in the regions of France, Spain and Latin America where it is practised, as well as its artistic merits, he has also argued that it has a direct impact on conservation with one fifth of Spain's natural landscape of meadow and forest, the \"dehesa\", being on the 1,300-or so fighting bull-breeding ranches, 1% of Spain's landmass, which is only kept in this state by the subsidy to the meat price of the cattle given by the box-office of the bull-rings.\n\nThe question of public funding is particularly controversial in Spain, since widely disparaged claims have been made by supporters and opponents of bullfighting. According to government figures, bullfighting in Spain generates €1600 million a year and 200,000 jobs, 57,000 of which are directly linked to the industry. Furthermore, bullfighting is the cultural activity which generates the most tax revenue for the Spanish state (€45 million in VAT and over €12 million in social security).\n\nCritics often claim that bullfighting is financed with public money. However, despite bullfighting involving around 25 million spectators annually, it represents just 0.01% of those state subsidies allocated to cultural activities, and always under 3% of the cultural budget of regional, provincial and local authorities. The bulk of subsidies are paid by local town halls where there is a historical tradition and support for bullfighting and related events, which are often held without charge to participants and spectators. The European Union does not subsidize bullfighting but it does subsidize cattle farming in general, which also benefits those who rear Spanish fighting bulls.\n\nIn 2015, 438 of 687 Members of the European Parliament (MEP) voted in favour of amending the 2016 E.U. budget to indicate that the \"Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) appropriations or any other appropriations from the budget should not be used for the financing of lethal bullfighting activities\".\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, some Spanish \"regeneracionista\" intellectuals protested against what they called the policy of \"pan y toros\" (\"bread and bulls\"), an analogue of Roman \"panem et circenses\" promoted by politicians to keep the populace content in its oppression. Such belief was part of the wider current of thought known as \"anti-flamenquismo\" whereby they simultaneously campaigned against the popularity of both bullfighting and flamenco music, which they believed to be \"oriental\" elements of Spanish culture which were responsible for Spain's backwardness as compared to the rest of Europe. During the Franco dictatorship, bullfights were supported by the state as something genuinely Spanish, as the \"fiesta nacional\", so that bullfights became associated with the regime and, for this reason, many thought they would decline after the transition to democracy, but this did not happen. The government of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero was the first to be more opposed to bullfighting, prohibiting children under 14 from attending and limiting or prohibiting the broadcast of bullfights on national TV, although the latter measure was reversed after his party lost the elections in 2011. Nevertheless, his party is overall not opposed to bullfighting and anti-bullfighting measures have only been passed in municipalities where it governs in coalition with the far-left party Podemos which has taken a clearer anti-bullfighting stance. However, even Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias has recently stated that even though he is opposed to it, he would not ban bullfighting if his party came to power.\n\nDespite its long history in Barcelona, in 2010 bullfighting was outlawed across the Catalonia region, following a campaign led by an animal rights civic platform called \"Prou!\" (\"Enough!\" in Catalan). Critics have argued that the ban was motivated by issues of Catalan separatism and identity politics. In October 2016, the Constitutional Court ruled that the regional Catalan Parliament did not have competence to ban any kinds of spectacle that are legal in Spain.\n\nThe Spanish Royal Family is divided on the issue, from Queen Sofía who does not hide her dislike for bullfights; to King Juan Carlos who occasionally presides over a bullfight from the royal box as part of his official duties; to their daughter Princess Elena who is well known for her liking of bullfights and who often accompanies the king in the presiding box or attends privately in the general seating.\nThe King has allegedly stated that \"the day the EU bans bullfighting is the day Spain leaves the EU\".\n\nPro-bullfighting supporters include the former Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and his party (Partido Popular), as well as most leaders of the major left-leaning opposition PSOE Party, including former Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and the current Presidents of Andalusia, Extremadura and Castilla–La Mancha. Nevertheless, former PSOE Prime Minister Zapatero was more lukewarm towards the Fiesta, and under his government there was a 6-year ban on live bullfights broadcast on the state-run national TV channel. This has been lifted since his government was voted out in 2011. Live bullfights are shown at the traditional 6 p.m. time on TVE as of September 2012.\n\nBullfighting has been seen as intertwined with religion and religious folklore in Spain at a popular level, particularly in the areas where it is most popular. Bullfighting events and festivities are as a rule celebrated as a core (yet profane) element of religious festivities celebrating local patron saints, always alongside a range of other festive activities. On the other hand, the bullfighting world is also inextricably linked to religious iconography involved with religious devotion in Spain, with bullfighters seeking the protection of various virgins and often being members of religious brotherhoods.\n\nState-run Spanish TVE had cancelled live coverage of bullfights in August 2007 until September 2012, claiming that the coverage was too violent for children who might be watching, and that live coverage violated a voluntary, industry-wide code attempting to limit \"sequences that are particularly crude or brutal\". In October 2008, in a statement to Congress, Luis Fernández, the President of Spanish State Broadcaster TVE, confirmed that the station will no longer broadcast live bullfights due to the high cost of production and a rejection of the events by advertisers. However the station will continue to broadcast \"Tendido Cero\", a bullfighting magazine programme. Having the national Spanish TV stop broadcasting it, after 50 years of history, was considered a big step towards its abolition. Nevertheless, other regional and private channels keep broadcasting it with good audiences.\n\nThe former Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and his government lifted the ban on live bullfights being shown on TVE and live bullfights are now shown at the traditional 6 p.m. time on TVE as of September 2012.\n\nA television station in Costa Rica stopped the broadcast of bullfights in January 2008, on the grounds that they were too violent for minors.\n\nA growing list of Spanish and South American cities and regions have started to formally declare their celebrations of bullfighting part of their protected cultural patrimony. Most of these declarations have come into place as a counter-reaction in the aftermath of the 2010 ban in Catalonia.\n\nAs of April 2012, the latest addition to this list is the Andalusian city of Seville.\n\nIn November 1567, Pope Pius V issued a papal bull titled \"De Salute Gregis\" and forbidding fighting of bulls and any other beasts as the voluntary risk to life endangered the soul of the combatants, but it was abolished eight years later by his successor, Pope Gregory XIII, at the request of King Philip II.\n\nBullfighting was introduced in Uruguay in 1776 by Spain and abolished by Uruguayan law in February 1912. Bullfighting was also introduced in Argentina by Spain, but after Argentina's independence, the event drastically diminished in popularity and was abolished in 1899 under law 2786.\n\nBullfighting was present in Cuba during its colonial period, but was abolished by the United States military under the pressure of civic associations right after the Spanish–American War in 1901. Bullfighting was also banned for a period in Mexico in 1890; consequently some Spanish bullfighters moved to the United States to transfer their skills to the American rodeos.\n\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, bullfighting in Spain was banned at several occasions (for instance by Philip V), but always reinstituted later by other governments.\n\nBullfighting had some popularity in the Philippines during Spanish rule, though foreign commentators derided the quality of local bulls and toreros. Bullfighting was noted in the Philippines as early as 1619, when it was among the festivities in celebration of Pope Urban III's authorisation of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. Following the Spanish–American War, the Americans suppressed the custom in the Philippines under the tenure of Governor General Leonard Wood, and it was replaced with a now-popular Filipino sport, basketball.\n\nBullfighting is now banned in many countries; people taking part in such activity would be liable for terms of imprisonment for animal cruelty. \"Bloodless\" variations, though, are often permitted and have attracted a following in California, Texas, and France. In southern France, however, the traditional form of the corrida still exists and it is protected by French law. However, in June 2015 the Paris Court of Appeals removed bullfighting/\"la corrida\" from France's cultural heritage list. While it is not very popular in Texas, bloodless forms of bullfighting occur at rodeos in small Texas towns.\n\nIn 1991, the Canary Islands became the first Spanish Autonomous Community to ban bullfighting, when they legislated to ban spectacles that involve cruelty to animals, with the exception of cockfighting, which is traditional in some towns in the Islands; bullfighting was never popular in the Canary Islands. Some supporters of bullfighting and even Lorenzo Olarte Cullen, Canarian head of government at the time, have argued that the fighting bull is not a \"domestic animal\" and hence the law does not ban bullfighting. The absence of spectacles since 1984 would be due to lack of demand. In the rest of Spain, national laws against cruelty to animals have abolished most blood sports, but specifically exempt bullfighting.\n\nSeveral cities around the world (especially in Catalonia) have symbolically declared themselves to be Anti-Bullfighting Cities, including Barcelona in 2006.\n\nIn Galicia, bullfighting has been banned in many cities by the local governments. Bullfighting has never had an important following in the region.\n\nOn 18 December 2009, the parliament of Catalonia, one of Spain's seventeen Autonomous Communities, approved by majority the preparation of a law to ban bullfighting in Catalonia, as a response to a popular initiative against bullfighting that gathered more than 180,000 signatures. On 2010, with the two main parties allowing their members a free vote, the ban was passed 68 to 55, with 9 abstentions. This meant Catalonia became the second Community of Spain (first was Canary Islands in 1991), and the first on the mainland, to ban bullfighting. The ban took effect on 1 January 2012, and affects only the one remaining functioning Catalan bullring, the Plaza de toros Monumental de Barcelona.\nIt does not affect the \"correbous\", a traditional game of the Ebro area (south of Catalonia) where lighted flares are attached to a bull's horns. The correbous are seen mainly in the municipalities in the south of Tarragona, with the exceptions of a few other towns in other provinces of Catalonia. The name \"correbous\" is essentially Catalan and Valencian; in other parts of Spain they have other names.\n\nThere is a movement to revoke the ban in the Spanish congress, citing the value of bullfighting as \"cultural heritage\". The proposal is backed by the majority of parliamentarians.\n\nIn October 2016 the Spanish Constitutional Court ruled that the regional Catalan Parliament has no competence to ban any kind of spectacle that is legal in Spain.\n\nIn Costa Rica the law prohibits the killing of bulls and other animals in public and private shows. However, there are still bullfights at the end and beginning of the year that are televised from Palmares and Zapote. Volunteers confront a bull in a ring and try to provoke him into charging and then run away. In a December 2016 survey, 46.4% of respondents wanted to outlaw bullfights while 50.1% thought they should continue. Los Toros a la Tica as they are called does not include spears or any other device to harm the bull.\n\nEcuador staged bullfights to the death for over three centuries due to being a former Spanish colony. On 12 December 2010, Ecuador's president Rafael Correa announced that in an upcoming referendum, the country would be asked whether to ban bullfighting; in the referendum, held in May 2011, the Ecuadorians agreed on banning the final killing of the bull that happens in a corrida. This means the bull is no longer killed before the public, and is instead taken back inside the barn to be killed at the end of the event. The other parts of the corrida are still performed the same way as before in the cities that celebrate it. This part of the referendum is applied on a regional level, meaning that in regions where the population voted against the ban, which are the same regions where bullfighting is celebrated the most, killing the animal publicly in the bullfighting plaza is still performed. The main bullfighting celebration of the country, the Fiesta Brava in Quito was still allowed to take place in December 2011 after the referendum under these new rules.\n\nBullfighting has been banned in three Mexican states: Sonora in 2013, Guerrero in 2014 and Coahuila in 2015.\n\nBullfighting was forbidden in several areas in Portugal, such as Viana do Castelo. In 2009, the mayor has claimed the city as the first \"anti-bullfighting city\" in Portugal when it was forbidden the use of the bullring for those activities.\n\nJallikattu, a type of bull-taming or bull-riding event is practiced in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. A bull is released into a crowd of people and participants attempt to grab the bull's hump and either hold on for a determined distance, length of time, or with the goal of liberating a packet of money tied to the bull's horns. The practice was banned in 2014 by India's Supreme Court over concerns that bulls are sometimes mistreated prior to jallikattu events. Animal welfare investigations into the practice revealed that some bulls are poked with sticks and scythes, some have their tails twisted, some are force-fed alcohol to disorient them, and in some cases chili powder and other irritants are applied to bulls' eyes and genitals to agitate the animals. The 2014 ban was suspended and reinstated several times over the years. In January 2017, the Supreme Court upheld their previous ban and various protests arose in response. Due to these protests, on 21 January 2017, the Governor of Tamil Nadu issued a new ordinance that authorized the continuation of jallikattu events. On 23 January 2017 the Tamil Nadu legislature passed a bi-partisan bill, with the accession of the Prime Minister, exempting jallikattu from the Prevention of Cruelity to Animals Act (1960). Jallikattu is legal in Tamil Nadu, but another organization may challenge the mechanism by which it was legalized, as the Animal Welfare Board of India claims that the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly does not have the power to override Indian federal law, meaning that the state law could possibly once again be nullified and jallikattu banned.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3406143", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3406143", "title": "Conspiracy (civil)", "text": "Conspiracy (civil)\n\nA civil conspiracy or collusion is an agreement between two or more parties to deprive a third party of legal rights or deceive a third party to obtain an illegal objective.\nA conspiracy may also refer to a group of people who make an agreement to form a partnership in which each member becomes the agent or partner of every other member and engage in planning or agreeing to commit some act. It is not necessary that the conspirators be involved in all stages of planning or be aware of all details. Any voluntary agreement and some overt act by one conspirator in furtherance of the plan are the main elements necessary to prove a conspiracy. A conspiracy may exist whether legal means are used to accomplish illegal results, or illegal means used to accomplish something legal. \"Even when no crime is involved, a civil action for conspiracy may be brought by the persons who were damaged.\"\n\nIn the law of tort, the legal elements necessary to establish a civil conspiracy are substantially the same as for establishing a criminal conspiracy, i.e. there is an agreement between two or more natural persons to break the law at some time in the future or to achieve a lawful aim by unlawful means. The criminal law often requires one of the conspirators to take an overt step to accomplish the illegal act to demonstrate the reality of their intention to break the law, whereas in a civil conspiracy, an overt act towards accomplishing the wrongful goal may not be required. Etymologically, the term comes from Latin \"con-\" \"with, together\", and \"spirare\" \"to breathe\".\n\nBusiness litigation often involves the use of conspiracy lawsuits against two or more corporations. Often joined in the lawsuit as defendants are the officers of the companies and outside accountants, attorneys, and similar fiduciaries. In many states, officers and directors of a corporation cannot engage in a conspiracy with the corporation unless acting for their private benefit independent of any benefit to the corporation.\n\nCivil conspiracy law often takes the form of antitrust lawsuits, usually litigated in federal court, where the plaintiff seeks treble damages for overpayments caused by price-fixing above the market rate. The federal Sherman Antitrust Act provides both civil and criminal penalties. Other agreements among businesses and their agents for group boycotts, to monopolize, and to set predatory prices with intent to drive a small competitor out of business, would be actionable.\n\nConspiracies in violation of the federal securities laws such as the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 form another area where intense civil and criminal lawsuits occur over the existence or non-existence of an alleged conspiracy. Both the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice bring legal actions for conspiracies to violate the securities laws. For example,a regional bank called PNC Financial Services Group Inc. through a subsidiary agreed, in June 2003, to pay $115 million in civil fines and restitution to settle the SEC's allegations of securities fraud. The subsidiary was accused of conspiracy to violate securities laws by transferring $762 million in troubled loans and investments to off-balance-sheet entities in 2001. In that case, the Justice Department deferred prosecution of PNC, citing its cooperation in a related investigation. Similarly, the civil litigation against the tobacco companies to recover health care costs, alleges a conspiracy under the Medical Care Recovery Act, , et seq. (Count One), the Medicare Secondary Payer provisions of Subchapter 18 of the Social Security Act, (b)(2)(B)(ii) & (iii) (Count Two), and the civil provisions of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (\"RICO\"), to deceive the American public about the health effects of smoking.\n\nOften the modern civil law of conspiracy is described in \"plain language\" jury instructions. The standard California jury instruction for conspiracy is governed by Rule 2.1050 of the California Rules of Court, The new California jury instructions are designated as the “official instructions for use in the state of California.” It is not mandatory for the California judges to use them; but it is strongly encouraged. Some of the \"plain language\" California civil instructions about conspiracy read as follows with fictional names placed in the blanks in the jury instruction form:\n\nA conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to commit a wrongful act.\n\nSuch an agreement may be made orally or in writing or implied by the conduct of the parties.\n\nPlaintiff Smith, Inc., claims that it was harmed by Defendant Jones Corp. for refusing to sell widgets to Plaintiff Smith, Inc. with intent to unreasonably injure competition and that Defendant Brown & Associates is also liable for the harm because it was part of the conspiracy with Jones Corp. to unreasonably injure competition under the California antitrust laws.\nThe facts of each case can vary widely as to exact nature of the underlying scheme. In the above example, a common fact pattern could be that widgets are necessary equipment needed for Smith, Inc. to manufacture its product, and Brown & Associates is a competitor of Smith, Inc.\n\nHow the conspirators entice one another into the scheme also varies with each case. One fact pattern for the above example would be Brown & Associates promises Jones, Corp. (the supplier of widgets) to give Jones part of the additional profits that Brown hopes to make if Smith, Inc goes out of business because it lacks the necessary widgets.\n\nThe tort of conspiracy requires there to be knowledge of the relevant circumstances and of the agreement made. Thus, as a precondition to corporate liability, it must be possible to attribute the relevant employee's or agent's knowledge to the corporation. There are two possible legal approaches:\nThere is little difficulty when the claim is that the company either conspired with a second company or with at least two natural persons. The requisite knowledge can be attributed under either head as appropriate. But there is a problem under the first heading when fraud is involved because there is a clash of authority. \"Lloyd v Grace, Smith & Co\" [1912] AC 716 held that a Principal may be liable where the Agent commits a fraud within actual or apparent authority, whereas in \"In re Hampshire Land Company\" [1896] 2 Ch 743, it was held that the knowledge and, sometimes, the conduct of an Agent acting fraudulently so as to cause loss to the Principal will not be imputed to the Principal. In theory, vicarious liability may be of more assistance in that it is attributing the wrong done by one (natural) person to another (fictitious) but, in \"Belmont Finance Corporation v Williams Furniture Ltd\" [1979] Ch 250, the \"Hampshire Land\" agency line of authority was preferred. Belmont, a company in liquidation, sued a number of defendants, including the majority of its own directors, for conspiracy to procure Belmont to buy shares in another company at a gross overvalue. The purpose of this plan was to fund the acquisition of shares in Belmont itself by some of the defendants. Foster J. struck out the claim on the basis that Belmont was itself a party to the conspiracy. On appeal, Buckley LJ. said:\nBecause Belmont could only be a party to the conspiracy if knowledge was imputed, the Court of Appeal insulated it from the knowledge of its directors even though those directors, with that knowledge, made relevant decisions at board meetings and attached the company seal to the relevant documents. To that extent, liability in conspiracy is different from the standard vicarious liability situations in which, say, a company will be deemed to know that vehicles or machinery have not been properly maintained or that a service has been negligently delivered.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "33266120", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33266120", "title": "Contract Law of Saudi Arabia", "text": "Contract Law of Saudi Arabia\n\nContract law in Saudi Arabia is governed by the conservative Hanbali school of Sharia Law, which adopts a fundamentalist and literal interpretation of the Quran. Any contract that is not specifically prohibited under Sharia law is legally binding, with no discrimination against foreigners or non-Muslims.\n\nThe Hanbali school is the most liberal among the four Sunni schools with respect to the freedom of persons to contract. However, the degree of freedom of contract is governed by the prohibitions in the Quran, and two distinctive doctrines in Sharia law: \"riba\" (usury) and \"gharar\" (speculation).\n\nUnlike other Sharia law jurisdictions, Sharia law remains uncodified in Saudi Arabia due to the strong literalist view of the Hanbali school. There is also no established case reporting in the courts. This has led to much uncertainty and variation in court decisions. Despite being the world's 11th easiest economy to do business in, Saudi Arabia ranks 140th out of 183 economies in terms of enforcement of contracts. (see below: Appendix)\n\nIn 2007, King Abdullah initiated legal reforms to modernise the courts and codify Sharia law in Saudi Arabia. The ulama, the religious body, approved a codification of Sharia law in 2010, and a sourcebook of legal principles and precedents was published on January 3, 2018. (see below: Legal Reform)\n\nSaudi Arabia is principally governed by Sharia Law, with royal decrees playing a complementary role.\n\nThe Hanbali school of law acknowledges the following sources of law:\nBoth \"ijmas\" and \"qiyas\" constitute \"fiqh\", Islamic jurisprudence based upon scholar opinions amassed over the years.\n\nOrdinances (\"nizam\"), consisting of royal decrees which address modern legal issues and bureaucratic matters, is another source of law. These royal decrees by the King supplement \"fiqh\". Royal decrees are considered subordinate to Sharia law as only religious law is considered \"law\" under Sharia law. The courts will apply \"fiqh\" over \"nizam\" if the legal issue is already considered in Sharia law, or if \"nizam\" conflicts with Sharia law.\n\nOther forms of regulations (\"lai'hah\") including Royal Orders, Council of Ministers Resolutions, Ministerial Resolutions and, Ministerial Circulars, are likewise subordinate to Sharia law. While contract law is generally governed under Sharia law, many areas of modern business and commercial activities are not considered under Sharia law and are hence governed by the applicable regulations.\n\nSaudi Arabia also abides by international treaties, which are approved by royal decree. One such example is Royal Decree No.11, dated 16 Rajab 1414, corresponding to 30 December 1993, which declared Saudi Arabia's ascension to the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards.\n\nA contract of sale (\"bay’\") can be concluded for the exchange of anything regarded as a commodity or property (\"mal\"). However, there are certain things that are not included as \"mal\" under Sharia and therefore cannot be the subject of a sale. These include: pigs, alcohol, and animals not ritually slaughtered. In accordance to the Quran, there are two exceptions to contract formation: the taking of interest (\"riba\"), and the use of speculative contracts.\n\nThe rules on conclusion of the contract of sale are stricter than the rules in most modern legal systems. Conclusion of the contract must take place at the same transaction as offer and acceptance. Furthermore, there is a right of withdrawal of the offer even after acceptance.\n\nAt common law, auctions, advertisements, displays of goods on shelves, tenders and the like are treated as mere invitations to create an offer. In contrast, Sharia law recognises these as valid offers (\"Ijab\") which, upon being accepted (\"Qabul\"), will become binding by law upon the parties involved in the transaction.\n\nGenerally, a statement with the description and price of goods constitutes an offer, and a display of goods with the price similarly is an offer. However, advertisers can specify that the advertisement is only an invitation to treat.\n\nLike the common law, offer and acceptance are among the vital ingredients of a contract in Islamic law. An offer is a proposal, which leads to an agreement when there is an acceptance of the offer. If there is an acceptance, the offeror is bound by law to perform his promise. The offeror has no right to revoke his offer after its acceptance and he must be prepared to complete his promised accordingly.\n\nA statement of an offer has to be made in the past tense (\"Sighatul-Madhi\") to be constituted as a valid offer in Sharia law. Making the statement in past tense signifies the seller's intention of making a valid offer which is capable of being accepted by the buyer. Once the offer has been accepted, the seller has no right to revoke his offer. If he does revoke his offer, it will be considered a breach of promise on his behalf, which is a great sin in Islam as it encourages rivalry and mischief among the people.\n\nUnlike common law, Saudi Arabian law requires acceptance to be made before the parties attempting to contract physically part.\n\nCertain terms must also be stated for a Saudi Arabian contract to be enforceable. These include: the items involved, quantity, price, parties and how payment will be made.\n\nThe concept of consideration implies the bargain, or value given in return for value received. Islamic law, unlike common law, does not require consideration. A contract in Saudi Arabia is a bond between the parties and God, hence, the element of consideration is deemed superfluous.\n\nSimilar to common law, defects of consent will prevent the formation of a valid agreement. Vitiating factors include mistake, misrepresentation, duress\nand undue influence...\n\nNot all contractual arrangements are condoned in Sharia law. Unless a term is positively allowed by revelation (\"in the book of God\"), it is invalid.\n\nClassical Sharia law rarely discusses the idea of contractual freedom outside the standard contract types. Instead, it provides for situation where standard contracts can be altered or combined. There are specific prohibitions raised by other \"hadiths\", some important ones prohibiting a loan and a sale, two sales in one, and a sale of what one does not have.\n\nStipulations are divided into three types:\n\nIf the court finds stipulation a void, the contract itself may or may not be void- results vary casuistically.\nIn particular, concomitant stipulations that coincide with or contradict an entailment of the contract, such as a stipulation that a buyer must never resell the object, are forbidden.\n\nCombinations of contracts conditioned on each other are open to many objections, because they confuse the price of the individual contracts and obstruct meting out fair remedies for breach, thereby opening a door to \"riba\" and \"gharar\". There are two major types of contracts that are prohibited in Islamic law: contracts involving usury or uncertainty.\n\nThe Quran forbids \"riba\" in the strongest terms. \"Riba\" is an unjustified enrichment and the principle encompasses a total ban on the charging of interest.\n\nUsurious transactions were classified into three classes:\n\"Riba al-fadl\" and \"riba al-nasi'a\" apply to the exchange of two precious metals (gold or silver) and four commodities (wheat, barley, dates and salt), based on the Prophet's tradition. It was further extended by analogy to the products of these six articles if their present or future exchange could have the smell or taint of \"riba\". Islamic law did not permit exchange of unequal values of these articles and by analogy to a variety of their products. These articles happened to be the basic necessities of life and were a convenient means of exploitation. Promises for future performance were forbidden if goods comprised these articles as the transactions were suspected to contain \"riba\".\n\nThe interpretation of \"riba\" has continued to be revised under the changing economic setting. By the turn of the century, the leading Islamic scholars Abduh and Rida held the view that \"riba al-Jahilya\" was forbidden but it could be deemed lawful under extreme necessity, and that \"riba al-fadl\" and \"riba al nasi'a\" are under a rebuttable presumption of prohibition.\n\nThe ban against interest rates has been circumvented by both parties pretending that a greater amount was lent or that the difference between loan and debt is actually a commission rate.\n\nGambling is another type of transaction condemned in the Quran.\n\nThe Sunna takes this prohibition much further; it not only condemns gambling but also sales of \"gharar\" (peril, risk or hazard).\n\nBesides this, other transactions which are conditioned on uncertain events are also prohibited. Lack of knowledge about the existence or nonexistence of the subject matter, or concerning its quality, quantity, or date of performance, was held to trigger \"gharar\". The ongoing refinement of the doctrine has been narrowed down to the presence or absence of uncertainty about future performance and not to the existence or non-existence of the subject matter at the time of contract. If the nonexistent article or subject matter is certain to be delivered or performed at a future date the prohibition of \"gharar\" does not apply.\n\nRescission is allowed under specific circumstances, such as when the seller fails to perform; the merchandise is defective or the quantity incorrect; the quality of service inferior; or when unforeseen circumstances prevent the completion of the contract.\n\nIn accordance with Islamic law, remedies for contract are restricted to direct and actual damages. The courts will not recognize economic loss of chance, interest, potential profits and other speculative awards that would normally might be given. Specific performance and injunctive relief are likewise generally unavailable.\n\nSaudi Courts also preclude consequential damages based on anticipated profits. As such, contracts involving relationships over time such as continuous supply of goods will not attract full liability if wrongfully terminated. Courts would only award reparations for immediate damages.\n\nIslamic law fixes the relationship of contracting parties to any object involved in the contract as to liability for loss or damage. A party holds the object either as a 'trustee' (\"amin\") or as a 'guarantor' (\"damin\"). A trustee is not liable at all for injury to the object, unless shown to be in breach of trust. A \"damin\", however, bears the same risk of loss as an owner. If an object is destroyed through an act of God or force majeure, the guarantor has no recourse.\n\nEnforcing of a contract consists of three main stages:\n\nThe plaintiff is to ask the defendant for compliance with the contract before filing his summons with the court. Before admitting a plaintiff's summons, a judge will examine it for formal requirements. The summons will be then delivered to a summoning officer for service of process on defendant.\n\nThe defendant files a written defense in answer to the plaintiff's claim. The judge will then set a deadline for the plaintiff to answer the defendant's answer with a written pleading. A pre-trial conference will be held where the judge will discuss procedural issues with the parties. At trial, merits of the case will be argued, and cross examination of witnesses, if any, will take place. After receiving the judgment, the plaintiff is to formally notify the defendant of the judgment. The defendant will then be given a choice to appeal before a certain deadline.\n\nThe plaintiff approaches a court enforcement office or private bailiff to request for an enforcement order. The defendant will be requested to voluntarily comply with the judgment. For contracted debt, the judge will call for a public auction for the property to be sold after the attachment of the defendant’s movable goods. The proceeds of the public auction are distributed to various creditors according to rules of priority.\n\nForeign law contracts are generally enforceable so long as they conform to Sharia law. Thus contracts deemed to be usury or dealing with gambling or risk would not be enforceable. Courts and judicial committees in Saudi Arabia also do not recognise the doctrine of conflict of laws. Hence any action based on a foreign law contract can be submitted to the courts even if there are express choice of law provisions.\n\nThe Board of Grievances, a statutory tribunal separate from the Sharia courts, is empowered to hear requests for the enforcement of foreign judgments and arbitral awards. Article 6 of the Rules of Pleadings and Procedures of the Grievances Board provides that an applicant seeking to enforce foreign judgments or arbitral awards must prove that:\n\nFirstly, the judgment or award must not be contrary to Sharia law or public policy; it must not offend the Sharia principles of \"riba\" and \"gharar\". Judgments or awards involving conventional insurance, speculative loss of chance, interest and potential profits would not be recognized.\n\nThe applicant must also show that a judgment or award by the Saudi Courts would be reciprocally enforced in the applicant’s country. In the past, the Board has declined to accept a legal opinion by a foreign lawyer or a letter from the UK government stating that foreign judgments would generally be enforced in the UK. This second requirement applies in the absence of any bilateral or multilateral agreement relating to the reciprocal enforcement of decisions. Despite being a signatory to regional reciprocity agreements and an international convention on the enforcement of arbitral awards, the decision to enforce such foreign judgements or awards is subject to compliance with Sharia law and public policy.\n\nKing Abdullah succeeded to the throne in 2005 and since then has implemented various reforms in Saudi Arabia with the aim of modernizing the legal system to improve investor confidence.\n\nThe King enacted the Law of Judiciary in 2007 to restructure the judicial system and proposed a codification of unwritten Sharia regulations and principles to ensure certainty and uniformity of judicial decisions. In 2009, the King removed the chairman of the Supreme Judicial Council as the ultraconservative cleric was impeding the king's proposed restructuring of the court system. The unseated cleric was also known to oppose codification of Sharia law.\n\nIn 2010, the top religious body in Saudi Arabia gave the green light for codification of Sharia law. Nonetheless, it has been commented that such legal reforms will take a considerable period of time to be fully implemented due to lack of well-trained judges and lawyers and the ulama's resistance to modernisation and change.\n\n<br>\nEase of enforcing contracts among the world's top 15 \"easiest to doing business\" economies compared (2010 World Bank Data)\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "53985730", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53985730", "title": "Copyright protection for fictional characters", "text": "Copyright protection for fictional characters\n\nCopyright protection is available to the creators of a range of works including literary, musical, dramatic and artistic works. Recognition of fictional characters as works eligible for copyright protection has come about with the understanding that characters can be separated from the original works they were embodied in and acquire a new life by featuring in subsequent works.\n\nIn the United States, in order to avail of copyright protection, a work must be original that is, it must involve an element of creativity, and must be fixed in a tangible medium. Further, there can be no copyright in mere ideas and facts, but only in the unique expression of the same. US Copyright Statute of 1976 does not explicitly mention fictional characters as subject matter of copyright, and their copyrightability is a product of common law. Historically, the Courts granted copyright protection to characters as parts of larger protected work and not as independent creations. They were regarded as ‘components in a copyrighted works’ and eligible for protection as thus. Recognition of characters as independent works distinct to the plot in which they were embodied came about only in 1930 in the case of Nichols v Universal Pictures. \nFollowing this, the American judiciary has evolved two main tests to determine whether a character in a work can be eligible for copyright protection.\n\nIn \"Nichols\", the Ninth Circuit Court denied protection to the plaintiff’s characters on the grounds that they were not “distinctly delineated”, but poorly developed. The plaintiff's characters of the Jewish gentleman and the poor Irish catholic girl he loved were regarded to be no more than mere ‘prototypes’. Justice Hand held that the less developed the character, the less the copyrightability of the same. Copyright protection shall therefore be enjoyed by a character provided it is well delineated. By applying this test, copyright protection was held to subsist in the character of Tarzan because it was found to be “sufficiently delineated.” Similarly, the character of Superman was held to found to be well delineated by virtue of embodying original literary expressions and incidents, and therefore deserving of copyright.\n\nUnder this approach, a three-step test is required to be followed. Firstly, the character must possess physical and conceptual attributes. Secondly, the character must be “sufficiently delineated” to be identified as the same character across multiple occasions. He must therefore show consistent traits. Lastly, the character must be “especially distinctive” and “contain some unique elements of expression. The consistency of a character's traits and attributes is considered as the key factor for whether the character qualifies for copyright protection. \n\nThe other approach propounded by the Ninth Circuit Court as laid down in \"Warner Bros. v. Columbia Broadcast Systems\" is that a character can avail of copyright protection only if it “constitutes the story being told”. In this case, the character in question- Sam Spade of the Maltese Falcon detective novel was held to be a “mere vehicle” for carrying the story forward, and thus no copyright protection was afforded to it. Also known as the \"Sam Spade Test\", this approach does not allow for copyrightability if the character is a “mere chessman in the game of storytelling.”\n\nOn the other hand, if the character is central to the story, then it will be copyrightable. In the case of \"Universal City Studios v. Kamar Industries\" this test was applied to hold that E.T was a distinctive character around whom the story in the movie \"E.T the Extra Terrestrial\" revolved. Therefore, the copyright in E.T was held to be enjoyed by Universal Studios, and the defendants were held liable for a violation of the Studios’ copyright by the manufacturing and sale of goods under the title ‘E.T Home Phones’.\n\nThe American judiciary has followed both these tests. There have also been a number of instances where the Court has used both the tests in its analysis. For instance, in \"Anderson v Stallone\", it was held that the character Rocky played by movie star Sylvestor Stallone in the eponymous movie franchise had come to be identified with certain physical traits and mannerisms that qualified as a well delineated character. Further, this ‘highly developed’ character was held to constitute the story being told. Similarly, the character of James Bond was awarded copyright protection on the grounds of being both sufficiently delineated as well as central to the story being told. The fact that the character had been played by multiple actors was not held to be relevant since the characteristics associated with Bond had remain consistent across sixteen films.\n\nCopyright protection is available to both characters that have been solely described in writing, as well as characters depicted in a visual or graphic form. What is required is that the character in question possesses original or a set of distinctive traits, and visual representation is not an essential. If the literary character is not depicted in a visual form, and has only been described in writing in a few lines, then the character cannot enjoy copyright. On the other hand, where the characters, like Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are found to be distinctive enough, they are held to be subject matter of copyright, even if they are merely in written form. Copyright protection may be granted to comic characters where the physical and conceptual characteristics find unique expression in graphic from. \n\nCopyright protection may also be afforded to the individual components of a character’s identity. For instance, copyrightability was granted to the glove worn by the protagonist in the movie \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" on the grounds that it helped identify the character, and therefore enjoyed a distinct protection separate from the character. Similarly, the superhero Batman’s car the Batmobile was held to be protectable by copyright on account of the fact that firstly it had a set of distinctive traits, and secondly these traits could be separated from the utilitarian functions of the car and be represented in pictorial, sculptural and graphic form.\n\nThe \"scenes a faire\" doctrine holds that those scenes or aspects that are indispensable to the story or are standard expressions cannot be copyrighted. This limitation also applies to fictional characters. Therefore, stock characters or archetypical and hackneyed elements are disqualified from protection by virtue of the fact that they are not unique in their expression. \n\nIn cases of copyright infringement of a fictional character, a two-step test developed by the American Courts has to be satisfied. Firstly, it must be established that the character in question is capable of being copyrighted. Secondly, it must be demonstrated that there has been an infringement of this unique expression. The delineation test and the story being told tests as explained above are used to determine the copyrightability of the character, and the Court must check whether the same is precluded from being afforded protection by virtue of applicability of the scenes a faire doctrine. Following this, the actual infringement is to be decided by comparing the original and allegedly infringing work for “substantial similarities” in appearance, as well as in personality traits. \n\nProtection of fictional characters may also be derived from certain alternative sources in American law.\n\nTrademark Law: Trademark rights may be enjoyed in a fictional character and can be enforced as such. To determine the infringement of the trademark it must be shown that the fictional character has acquired a “secondary meaning”, and that there is a likelihood of confusion to be caused to the public by the defendant’s mark which is deceptively similar to the original. Characters such as Mickey Mouse have been held to have acquired such a secondary meaning and protected under trademark law. \n\nRight to Publicity: This right traces its origins in the tort of privacy and is the right to prevent others from commercially exploiting one’s name and likeness. The portrayal of the Marx brothers as characters in a play was held to be an infringement of their right to publicity. \n\nDilution: Yet another remedy with its roots in trademark law is that of dilution. Under the doctrine of dilution, the plaintiff can seek relief for whittling away of the value of character. This doctrine has been applied for protection of fictional characters including that of Superman. In \"DC Comics v. Unlimited Monkey Business\", the defendants’ costumes were found to present a likelihood of dilution of the plaintiff’s trademark in the Superman character. \n\nMisappropriation: In order to argue for misappropriation of fictional characters, the plaintiff must demonstrate that firstly, there has been an investment of substantial amount of time and effort by him, secondly, the defendant has appropriated the product of such investment, and thirdly, such appropriation has caused loss to the plaintiff. The action of taking the plaintiff’s news bulletins and selling to its competitors was held to be a case of misappropriation.\n\nSection 13 of the Indian Copyright Act, 1957 allows for copyright in original literary, artistic, musical and dramatic works, as well as in sound recordings and cinematography films. The statute does not recognise fictional characters as subject matter of copyright, and protection for the same is derived from judge-made law. \n\nThe first instance where this issue was brought into light was in the case of \"Malayala Manorama v VT Thomas\". The Kerala High Court held that the defendant owned the copyright in his cartoon characters that he had created before entering into the plaintiff’s employment. \n\nSubsequently, the Delhi High Court in \"Raja Pocket Books v Radha Pocket Books\" found that the plaintiff’s copyright in his comic character the herpetologist ‘Nagraj’ had been infringed by the defendant’s character ‘Nagesh’ based on the semantic and phonetic similarities in their respective characters’ names, as well as in their visual representations and conceptual characteristics.\nHowever, the Court in \"VT Thomas\" did not discuss independent copyright in characters as this case was concerned with the issue of ownership of copyright. Further, the comparative analysis in \"Raja Pocket Books\" to arrive at a conclusion of infringement was undertaken by the Court without firstly stating that copyright subsisted in the plaintiff’s character. \n\nTherefore, in India, it can be implied that copyright protection is available to fictional characters, but the judiciary is yet to lay down any criteria for availing this protection. \n\nIn India, recourse can be had to trademark law which recognises that fictional characters enjoy goodwill, and provides relief for cases of ‘character merchandising’. Character merchandising has been defined as involving the exploitation of fictional characters by licensing these fictional characters in the case of \"Star India Private\" \"Limited vs Leo Burnett (India) Private Ltd\". A prerequisite for character merchandising is that the character to be merchandised must have gained some public recognition, independently of the original product in which it appears. In this case, the characters in the plaintiff’s were found not have acquired an independent recognition as a commodity, and therefore the suit for character merchandising by the defendants failed.\n"}

In the US, extraterritorial impacts in this field first arose from \"Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States\", where Imperial Oil in Canada was ordered to be divested from Standard Oil. Current practice dates from \"United States v. Alcoa\", where the \"effects doctrine\" was introduced, allowing for jurisdiction over foreign offenders and foreign conduct, so long as the economic effects of the anticompetitive conduct are experienced on the domestic market. The effects doctrine has been gradually developed in the U.S. and then in various forms accepted in other jurisdictions. In the EU it is known as the \"implementation test\".\n\nExtraterritorial jurisdiction in the area of antitrust faces various limitations, such as the problem of accessing foreign-based evidence, as well as the difficulties of challenged anticompetitive conduct arising from foreign state involvement.\n\nThe ability of parliaments of Commonwealth countries to legislate extraterritorially was confirmed by s. 3 of the \"Statute of Westminster 1931\".\n\nIn Australia, extraterritorial jurisdiction of the state parliaments was authorized by s.2 of the \"Australia Act 1986\".\n\nThe \"Criminal Code\" asserts jurisdiction over the following offences outside Canada:\n\nUnder Section 72 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, British citizens can be prosecuted for sexual offences committed against children abroad. Section 72 was used to convict paedophile Richard Huckle on 71 counts of serious sexual offences against children in Malaysia. Huckle is serving 22 life sentences. While no official tally is kept, seven people are believed to have been convicted under Section 72.\n\nIn the U.S., many states have laws or even constitutional provisions which permit cities to make certain decisions about the land beyond the town's incorporated limits.\n\nThe U.S. Criminal Code asserts the following items to fall within the \"special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States\", much of which is extraterritorial in nature:\n\nIn order to deal with the issue of private military contractors and private security contractors being used by U.S. Government agencies overseas, the \"Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act\" was passed by Congress to subject them to a similar manner of jurisdiction.\n\nCertain federal property has the status of federal enclave, restricting the application of state laws, but that has been partially rectified by the \"Assimilative Crimes Act\". Similarly, state jurisdiction is restricted on Indian lands.\n\nGenerally, the U.S. founding fathers and early courts believed that American laws could not have jurisdiction over sovereign countries. In a 1909 Supreme Court case, Justice Oliver Wendel Holmes introduced what came to be known as the \"presumption against extraterritoriality,\" making explicit this judicial preference that U.S. laws not be applied to other countries. American thought about extraterritoriality has changed over the years, however. For example, the Alien Tort Statute of 1789 allows foreign citizens in the United States to bring cases before federal courts against foreign defendants for violations of the \"law of nations\" in foreign countries. Although this statute was ignored for many years, U.S. courts since the 1980s have interpreted it to allow foreigners to seek justice in cases of human-rights violations in foreign lands, such as in \"Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain\". In \"Morrison v. National Australia Bank,\" 2010, the Supreme Court held that in interpreting a statute, the \"presumption against extraterritoriality\" is absolute unless the text of the statute explicitly says otherwise.\n\nEconomic sanctions with extraterritorial impact have been instituted under:\n\nUnlike most nations, the United States also attempts extraterritorial application of U.S. personal tax laws. The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act is an extension of this concept, which focuses on enforcement.\n\n\n"}

It begins with cases decided in 1880; pre-1880 cases were later retroactively compiled by West Publishing into a separate reporter, \"Federal Cases\". The third and current \"Federal Reporter\" series publishes decisions of the United States courts of appeals and the United States Court of Federal Claims; prior series had varying scopes that covered decisions of other federal courts as well. Though West is a private company that does not have a legal monopoly over the court opinions it publishes, it has so dominated the industry in the United States that legal professionals, including judges, uniformly cite to the \"Federal Reporter\" for included decisions. It is estimated that the Fourth Series of the \"Federal Reporter\" will begin sometime around 2025. The \"United States Reports\" are the official law reports of the rulings, orders, case tables, and other proceedings of the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\nThe \"Federal Reporter\" organizes court opinions within each volume by the date of the decision, and includes the full official text of the court's opinion. West editors add headnotes that summarize key principles of law in the cases, and Key Numbers that classify the decisions by topic within the West American Digest System.\n\nOnly decisions designated by the courts as \"for publication—those with full precedential value for which citation in court filings is permissible—are included in the \"Federal Reporter\". \"Unpublished\" decisions of the U.S. Courts of Appeals may be found in the \"Federal Appendix\", also published by West.

{"id": "14063623", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14063623", "title": "Gun laws in New Zealand", "text": "Gun laws in New Zealand\n\nAbout 230,000 licensed firearms owners own and use New Zealand's estimated 1.1 million firearms. As in Australia, but unlike the US and Canada, gun laws usually gain the support of both major parties before they are passed. Guns are not currently a major political issue, but have been immediately after the Aramoana massacre in 1990, and the Scottish Dunblane and Australian Port Arthur massacres in 1996.\n\nGun licenses are issued at the discretion of the police in New Zealand provided the police consider the person to be of good standing and without criminal, psychiatric or drug issues as well as meeting other conditions such as having suitable storage facilities. To be issued, they must be issued for a valid reason, which may not include self defense, although the law does not support this restriction for ownership for self defense. Several different categories of licenses are permitted, with the lowest one permitting access to restricted semi-automatic rifles and shotguns, with limited capacity, while the higher levels which permit fully automatic weaponry and pistols are rarely issued to civilians.\n\nVarious governments, groups behind the Thorp report, and the New Zealand Police have pushed for various forms of universal firearm registration. This has currently not succeeded but current manoeuvrings by the New Zealand Police are attempting to reclassify large numbers of 'A' category firearms as 'E' category (military-style semi-automatics), which requires them to be registered. This has been done though even by their own admission the New Zealand Police cannot reliably register the current military-style semi-automatic (MSSA) firearms.\n\nIn March 2009 the New Zealand police bid to reclassify certain types of civilian semi-automatic firearms was overturned by the New Zealand High Court as a result of a legal challenge mounted by the New Zealand National Shooters Association (NSA) president Richard Lincoln.\n\nGun laws in New Zealand are notably more liberal than other countries in the Pacific and focus mainly on vetting firearm owners, rather than registering firearms or banning certain types of firearms. Firearms legislation is provided for in the \"Arms Act\" and its associated regulations, though stricter unofficial police and government policies also apply.\n\nFirearms in New Zealand fall into one of four categories:\n\n\nRegistration is not required under the law but the police carry out a regime similar to registration for all but \"A Category\" firearms. Firearms in any other category require a \"permit to procure\" before they are transferred.\n\nExcept under supervision of a licence holder, owning or using firearms requires a firearms licence from the police. The licence is normally issued under the conditions that the applicant has secure storage for firearms, attends a safety program administered by the Mountain Safety Council and passes a written safety test. The police will also interview the applicant and two referees (one must be a close relative and the other not related) to determine whether the applicant is \"fit and proper\" to have a firearm. The applicant's residence is also visited to check that they have appropriate storage for firearms and ammunition. Having criminal associations or a history of domestic violence almost always leads to a licence being declined.\n\nA standard firearms licence allows the use of \"A Category\" firearms. To possess firearms of another category a person is required to get an endorsement to their licence. There are different endorsements for different classes of firearm but they all require a higher level of storage security, stricter vetting requirements and the applicant must have an end use for wanting the endorsement. Be it pest control for E cat, cowboy shooting and 3-gun for B cat, or just wanting to collect (provided one has adequate storage security) for C cat.\n\nEach endorsement type has additional requirements\n\nB Endorsement – Target (competition) pistols\n\nC Endorsement – Restricted weapons\n\nPistols can also be held on the C endorsement instead of the B. Common special reasons include:\n\nD Licence – Dealers licence\n\nFor those that make an income from firearms. To sell restricted weapons the dealer also needs to have the appropriate endorsements.\n\nE Endorsement – Military-style semi-automatics\n\nNew class of restricted weapon that was created after the Aramoana shooting spree. At the time anyone with an MSSA that wanted to keep it in that configuration was given a E endorsement (after going through the vetting and extra security requirements). But presently few are issued. Common reasons for wanting an E endorsement are professional pest destruction, collecting, 3-gun and service rifle shooting. Those people that did not want the extra hassle and expense of the endorsement converted their rifles into 'A' configuration by removing the components that made it an 'E'.\n\nF Endorsement – Dealers staff licence\n\nThis class allows a person working for a dealer to demonstrate a pistol, military-style semi-automatic or a collectable weapon without having to have that class of licence. They can demonstrate one but not possess one for personal use. This is not a well known endorsement\n\nAnyone buying firearms or ammunition, whether privately or from a dealer, needs to show their firearms licence. In addition, a permit to procure must be obtained prior to the transfer of pistols, military-style semi-automatics and restricted weapons. Sales can be made by mail-order, but a police officer must sign the order form to verify that the purchaser has a firearms licence.\n\nFirearms first arrived in New Zealand with European traders and were traded in large numbers to the native Māori. This lead partly to the Musket Wars of the early 19th century. The first gun control laws were enacted in 1845, but early regulations were ineffective until the passage of the \"Arms Act\" in 1860, which required licences and registration of firearms and firearm dealers. Early laws were mainly targeted at Māori during the land wars in the Waikato and Taranaki, and were largely suspended at the end of the 1880s. By about 1910 the laws were ignored and unenforced, as crime and the threat of political unrest were minimal.\n\nStrikes in 1912 and 1913, a Communist revolution in Russia, and large numbers of ex-military guns coming into the country after World War I were used as justification for a new law in 1920. The new law required the registration of all firearms and issuance of a \"permit to procure\" before a firearm was transferred. Semi-automatic pistols were banned and a special permit was needed for other pistols (e.g. revolvers), with the intent of discouraging the carrying of concealed weapons. Few changes were seen for the next forty years as crime remained low and the country avoided political violence.\n\nIncreasing gun crime in the 1960s led to greater police use of registration records, which were generally inaccurate or out-of-date. A project to check the register began in 1967, and found that 66 percent of entries were inaccurate in some way, with many guns not to be found at all. Police thought that the register was largely useless, and that substantial resources would be needed to keep it up-to-date. It was believed that the government would be unlikely to provide the resources required to update the register and that it would be politically difficult to demand registration information from firearm owners. Various new laws were introduced in the 1970s and 80s, proposing more government checks, registration of shotguns (which had been abandoned) and individual licensing.\n\nAn internal police report in 1982 criticised the proposals, saying there was no evidence that registration of guns helped to solve crimes, and that registration would use time and money better spent on other police work. This policy was adopted by the government in the 1983 Act.\n\nThe 1983 Arms Act abandoned registration for most long guns, as Parliament felt it was prohibitively expensive and not particularly useful. The philosophy of the new system was to control users, rather than firearms. Police were required to conduct a background check before a licence would be issued (though existing owners would be issued a licence automatically), but once a person had a licence there was no requirement to register long guns or obtain a permit-to-procure when they were sold or lent.\n\nSpecial restrictions applied to restricted weapons and pistols, which needed to be registered. Self-defence was no longer a valid reason to have a pistol (although the Crimes Act 1961 states a person can use \"reasonable force\" to defend oneself and/or one's property, and nowhere in this act states a person cannot use a firearm for such purposes, while the arms act does not mention \"directly in words\" one cannot use a firearm for self-defence), but the new sport of target pistol shooting has become more popular, and pistol club shooters can own pistols with a special \"B\" endorsement.\n\nAfter the Aramoana massacre in November 1990, John Banks, the Minister for Police, announced that the government would ban what he and others described as \"Rambo-style\" weapons and substantially tighten gun laws generally. The law was eventually passed in 1992 and required written permits to order guns or ammunition by mail order, restricted ammunition sales to firearms licence holders, added photographs to firearms licences, required licence holders to have secure storage for firearms at their homes (which would be inspected before a licence was issued), and, controversially, required all licence holders to be re-vetted for new licences, which would be valid for only 10 years.\n\nThe law also created the new category of \"military-style semi-automatic\", which like the Federal Assault Weapons Ban two years later in the United States, mainly covered the appearance rather than the functionality of the guns. These required a special endorsement, security and registration in the same manner as pistols, but could be used wherever A-category guns could.\n\nAfter two shootings by police in 1995, the government ordered an inquiry into police procedures for storing and using firearms. Before the review started, massacres overseas at Dunblane and Port Arthur led the government to expand the scope to gun control generally. The police reported that the system was sound and that no major changes were needed.\n\nThe government decided to order another report, this time led by former judge Thomas Thorp. The report was released in 1997 and called for many new restrictions on legal gun ownership, including banning various features, and that all guns be registered (the last particularly unpopular with firearm owners).\n\nThe National government in 1999, its last year in office, introduced an Arms Amendment (No. 2) Bill to implement the recommendations, and the bill was supported by the new Labour government. After the strong weight of submissions made against the bill when it was in select committee, the government was persuaded that the changes were unneeded and would be difficult to implement. Due to the opposition, the bill was withdrawn. The government then introduced a much reduced Arms Amendment (No. 3) Bill, which increased penalties for distribution, manufacture and use of illegal weapons. It has been in select committee since 2005, and the government has not shown any sign of proceeding with it.\n\nIn August 2009, the Police decided that any firearm, including single shot bolt action rifles, with a free-standing pistol grip that could allow the firearm to be shot inaccurately from the hip would be defined as an MSSA. However, the High Court rejected this attempt in Lincoln v Police [2010] BCL 194; 33 TCL 11/2.\n\nThe New Zealand Police administer and enforce the Arms Act 1983. They are issued Bushmaster XM-15 semi-automatic rifles, Glock 17 gen 4 pistols, and Tasers, which are normally carried in patrol cars and not on the officers.\n\nThe New Zealand Police Association, the police union / service association, has repeatedly lobbied for greater access to firearms for police officers. As well as stricter regulations on licensed firearm owners.\nThe Council of Licensed Firearms Owners (COLFO) was set up in 1996.\n\nThe Sporting Shooters Association of New Zealand is a part-time lobby group that is usually only active at elections and when there are government calls for gun control laws. It is smaller than COLFO. \n\nThe National Shooters Association is a nationwide civilian gun owners association that took the forefront in a 2009 legal challenge against unauthorised police interference with gun regulations. Its executive is largely made up of former members of the Practical Shooting Institute, a predecessor group which had similar success bringing court action against Police interference in 1990.\n\nThe two major anti-gun groups in recent years have been the Coalition for Gun Control, and Gunsafe NZ. Neither is still active, but were led by activist Philip Alpers and Mike Meyrick, a former police officer and lawyer.\n\nThe main parties, Labour and National, generally treat gun control as a bi-partisan issue. Both support the passage of the Arms Amendment (No. 3) Bill.\n\nThe Outdoor Recreation party was formed in 2001 to support hunting and sport fishing. It failed to gain any seats in 2002, and again in 2005, when, with the United Future party, it contested the election.\n\nThe Green Party supports an increase in legislative restrictions on public access to firearms. The Greens policies include the full ban of private ownership of all semi automatic firearms and the reintroduction of a national firearms registry.\n\nThe New Zealand First party supports the right of New Zealanders to own and use firearms safely and responsibly for hunting, sport, pest control, target shooting, and Home Defence (Castle Doctrine). The Party does not support calls for universal gun registration, preferring the licensing of individual users. New Zealand First believes restrictions on firearms ownership by type should be dictated by functionality rather than appearance.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38298547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38298547", "title": "Harmon Wilfred", "text": "Harmon Wilfred\n\nHarmon Lynn Wilfred is a New Zealand-based businessman. Formerly a U.S. citizen, he emigrated to Canada and then sought asylum in New Zealand after efforts to act as a whistleblower to expose alleged corruption during the resolution of the 1980s and 1990s savings and loan crisis. Wilfred eventually renounced his U.S. citizenship in 2005, becoming stateless as a result.\n\nWilfred's first career was as a real estate developer in the Denver area. He did well during the 1980s real estate boom, but after the advent of the savings and loan crisis his luck took a turn for the worse. By 1990, he had sold all but one of his properties, and the tenant in that property moved out, leaving him with no income to service the $3.2 million loan on the building. Wilfred declared personal bankruptcy, and attempted to work with the Resolution Trust Corporation to sell the building and pay off as much of the loan as possible. However, Wilfred states that the RTC wasted two years ignoring potential deals and then sold the building for $500,000, less than a third of the price Wilfred said he could have obtained for the building. The private company which eventually bought the building, immediately sold it for $1.25 million. In response, Wilfred sued RTC, and made efforts to gain class action status for his suit; he alleged that RTC's wasteful practices had cost taxpayers as much as $30 billion.\n\nWilfred also provided accounting information which led to a criminal investigation of the El Paso County Retirement Fund in 1994. The District Attorney's office did not find sufficient evidence to merit the filing of charges, but did not comment on whether or not they had discovered financial mismanagement.\n\nWilfred moved to Canada in the late 1990s, but was removed to the United States in 2000, in what he contends was an illegal extradition. He then moved to New Zealand in 2001 with his Canadian wife Caroline Dare-Wilfred. He went on to renounce U.S. citizenship in 2005, becoming stateless in the process; the U.S. is one of the few countries which allows its citizens abroad to renounce citizenship without having acquired the citizenship of any other country.\n\nImmigration New Zealand reportedly looked into deporting Wilfred, but he applied for New Zealand citizenship, and argued that deporting him to the United States would be inhumane. In 2008, he filed a complaint with the United Nations Human Rights Committee regarding alleged violations of his rights under the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights by Canada and the United States in relation to his 2000 extradition. However, the Committee could not act on his complaint: the United States was not a signatory to that Convention's First Optional Protocol, which recognises the competence of the ICCPR's individual complaint mechanism, and the Committee ruled that Wilfred had not provided sufficient evidence to prove his claims against Canada.\n\nIn New Zealand, Wilfred became involved in charitable work, providing vocational services for people with disabilities. He was elected chairman of Floyds Creative Arts Charitable Trust, later renamed La Famia Creative Arts; he also set up a number of other charities under the La Famia name. Wilfred and his wife also provided financial backing to the Champion Centre, an organisation for young children with special needs. \n\nWilfred's charities suffered funding issues as well as disputes with staff. To address funding issues, Wilfred looked into pursuing private business ventures through a charitable trust model, using investment proceeds to fund La Famia's continued operations. As part of this activity, he pressured one of the companies in which he invested, Prenzel Distilling Company, to sell off its award-winning gin and vodka brands. Wilfred stated, \"Anytime you're looking at hard liquor and then looking at family values there is going to be a conflict\".\n\nWilfred also use to run a radio show called Radio La Famia.\n\nAccording to an April 2013 report by \"The New Zealand Herald\", Wilfred's visa to remain in New Zealand expired in 2004, and he has since been out-of-status. David Carter and Christchurch MP Nicky Wagner, both of the New Zealand National Party, were impressed with his charitable work and business investments, and wrote letters of reference for him in support of his visa applications to remain in New Zealand. In November 2011, Associate Immigration Minister Kate Wilkinson appeared as a guest on his show, sparking political controversy because of media allegations that Wilfred had overstayed his visa. News coverage about Wilfred such as this resulted in a complaint to the New Zealand Press Council by Wilfred's friend and business partner Hugh Steadman; however, the Press Council did not agree with Steadman that the coverage amounted to a \"campaign of vilification and harassment\".\n\nIn April 2013, after Wilfred's trading company La Famia No. 2 Ltd was put into liquidation, Winston Peters of New Zealand First called for his deportation, citing allegations that he owed nearly NZ$300,000 to the Inland Revenue Department in unpaid GST and PAYE payments. \n\nImmigration New Zealand served a deportation order on Wilfred in 2011, but was unable to effect deportation due to the lack of a country to which he could be deported. In July 2013, INZ spokesman Dean Blakemore stated that his department had been discussing Wilfred's situation with U.S. authorities with a view to facilitating his removal from New Zealand, but that Wilfred's \"position as a stateless individual is an impediment to him being allowed entry into the US\".\n\nIn August 2013, the New Zealand Office of the Ombudsman began an investigation into the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, the ministry which oversees INZ, regarding its refusal to refer Wilfred's application for New Zealand citizenship to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Two immigration lawyers expressed consternation at the Ombudsman's investigation, and suggested that INZ's inability to deport people who become stateless after renouncing foreign citizenships or to block their applications for New Zealand citizenship was a \"loophole\" presenting problems for enforcement actions against people lacking legal immigration status. In response to the news, immigration compliance officer Natalie Gardiner stated that INZ's position was that Wilfred \"should leave the country as soon as possible.\" By March 2014, Gardiner stated that INZ remained unable to reach an agreement for the United States Embassy to issue a travel document to Wilfred, so he could be deported to the United States, despite the request of INZ Minister Michael Woodhouse that the U.S. government reconsider its position on the issue. His wife Caroline flew to Canada in September 2015 and subsequently had her New Zealand visa waiver revoked, effectively denying her re-entry to the country. Her application for a New Zealand investor visa was also turned down. In 2018, due to ongoing U.S. refusal to cooperate in Wilfred's deportation, Immigration New Zealand withdrew the deportation order against him, but his wife remained unable to return to New Zealand.\n\nWilfred has been married three times, most recently to Caroline Dare-Wilfred of Canada, whose family runs the Dare Foods Group of Ontario. Dare-Wilfred's marriage to him created tensions with her relatives, which eventually led her to attempt to sell her 27% stake in the Dare Foods Group. He has three children in the U.S. from his previous two marriages.\n"}
{"id": "30891381", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30891381", "title": "History of bankruptcy law in the United States", "text": "History of bankruptcy law in the United States\n\nThe history of bankruptcy law in the United States refers primarily to a series of acts of Congress regarding the nature of bankruptcy. As the legal regime for bankruptcy in the United States developed, it moved from a system which viewed bankruptcy as a quasi-criminal act, to one focused on solving and repaying debts for people and businesses suffering heavy losses.\n\nIn the Thirteen Colonies, laws regarding the payment and collection of debt were based on English common law. Debtors who were unable to repay their debts had property confiscated and assigned to the creditor, or were imprisoned.\n\nUpon the ratification of the United States Constitution in 1789, Congress was given the power under to legislate for \"uniform laws on the subject of Bankruptcies\" throughout the United States. Congress' first law on the subject was the Bankruptcy Act of 1800, which was limited to traders and provided only for involuntary proceedings. This was repealed in 1803. Diplomatist Edmund Roberts, President Andrew Jackson's envoy to the Far East, incorporated American concepts of bankruptcy protection into Article VI of the Roberts Treaty with Siam of 1833.\nVoluntary bankruptcy in the United States was first allowed by the Acts of 1841, and 1867. These early acts and the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, known as the Nelson Act, established the modern concepts of debtor-creditor relations.\n\nThe Bankruptcy Act of 1938, known as the Chandler Act expanded voluntary access to the bankruptcy system, and voluntary petitions were made more attractive to debtors. The Chandler Act gave authority to the Securities and Exchange Commission in the administration of bankruptcy filings.\n\nThe Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, commonly referred to as the Bankruptcy Code, constituted a major overhaul of the bankruptcy system. First, it covered cases filed after October 1, 1979. Second, the 1978 Act contained four titles. Title I was the amended Title 11 of the U.S. Code. Title II contained amendments to Title 28 of the U.S. Code and the Federal Rules of Evidence. Title III made the necessary changes in other federal legislation affected by the bankruptcy law changes. Title IV provided for the repeal of pre-Code bankruptcy, the effective dates of portions of the new law, necessary savings provisions, interim housekeeping details, and the pilot program of the United States trustee.\n\nPerhaps the most important changes to bankruptcy law under the 1978 Act, however, were to the courts themselves. The 1978 Act drastically altered the structure of the bankruptcy courts and conferred pervasive subject matter jurisdiction upon the courts. The act granted the new jurisdiction over all \"civil proceedings arising under title 11 or arising in or related to cases under title 11.\" 28 U.S.C. §1471(b) (1976 ed. Supp.) While the new courts were denominated adjuncts of the district court, they were in practice free standing courts. The expanded jurisdiction was to be exercised primarily by bankruptcy judges. The bankruptcy judge would continue to be an Article I judge, who was appointed for a set term.\n\nThe provisions of the 1978 Act came under scrutiny in the case of \"Northern Pipeline Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co.\", 458 U.S. 50, 102 S. Ct. 2858, 73 L. Ed.2d 598 [6 C.B.C.2d 785] (1982). The Court held unconstitutional the broad grant of jurisdiction to bankruptcy judges because those judges were not appointed under and protected by the provisions of Article III of the Constitution. Under the United States Constitution, the Article III judges hold their offices during good behavior (an appointment for life), and their salary cannot be reduced during their tenure in office. Article I judges do not enjoy such rights. The jurisdictional challenge started when a creditor filed an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court, which covered issues such as breach of contract, warranty, and misrepresentation. The bankruptcy court denied the defendant's motion to dismiss, and the defendant appealed to the District Court. The District Court held that 28 U.S.C. §1471 violated Article III of the Constitution because it delegated Article III powers to a non-Article III Court by its broad grant of jurisdiction to the bankruptcy courts. In a plurality opinion, the Supreme Court held that the broad grant of jurisdiction accorded bankruptcy courts by 28 U.S.C. '1471 was an unconstitutional delegation of Article III powers to a non-Article III Court. Similarly, Section 241(a) of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, by establishing the jurisdictional provisions set forth in 28 U.S.C. '1471 was held unconstitutional. The Court stayed its judgment until October 4, 1982, to give \"Congress an opportunity to reconstitute the bankruptcy courts or to adopt other valid means of adjudication, without impairing the interim administration of the bankruptcy laws.\" Id. 458 U.S. at 89. After the stay had expired, Congress still failed to act. Instead, a model \"Emergency Rule\" was adopted as a local rule by the district courts. The purpose of the rule was to avoid the collapse of the bankruptcy system, and it was a temporary measure to provide for the orderly administration of bankruptcy cases and proceedings after Marathon. The rule remained in effect until enactment of the 1984 legislation on July 10, 1984. Although the constitutionality of the \"Emergency Rule\" was under constant attack, the Supreme Court consistently denied certiorari.\n\nIn 1984, Congress implemented a \"permanent\" legislative solution to the issues addressed in \"Marathon\" by enacting the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984. By this act, with few exceptions, such as the trial of personal injury and wrongful death claims and matters that require consideration of both Title 11 and organizations or activities affecting interstate commerce, the new bankruptcy courts were allowed to exercise all of the subject matter jurisdiction of the district courts. Thus, bankruptcy courts were allowed to hear cases such as \"Marathon\".\n\nThe Act of 1984 in many ways resembled the Bankruptcy Act of 1898. Among other things, the law provided for the re-designation of separate units for bankruptcy judges under the district court system. Bankruptcy cases pending on or filed after July 10, 1984, are subject to most of the amendments relating to bankruptcy jurisdiction. The Bankruptcy Judges, United States Trustees, and Family Farmer Bankruptcy Act of 1986 made substantive changes relating to family farmers and established a permanent United States trustee system.

{"id": "3167373", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3167373", "title": "Japanese succession controversy", "text": "Japanese succession controversy\n\nThe Japanese succession controversy refers to desires to change the laws of succession to the Chrysanthemum Throne, which is currently limited to males of the Japanese Imperial Family.\n\nTraditionally, the imperial throne was passed on under custom which resembled the rule of agnatic seniority. Theoretically, any male or female with patrilineal lineage to early Japanese monarchs, who descended in direct male line from the first emperor, Jimmu, could come to hold the throne. In practice, preference was given to first-born male offspring of a preceding male monarch, followed by his brothers, sons and other males of the immediate male-line family; and ultimately followed by representatives of Shinnōke houses, in other words, male-line relatives, occasionally very distant male cousins.\n\nBecause there existed no restrictions on remarriage or polygyny in historical Japan, there existed usually many male relatives who could take over the throne. However, there are several historical instances of women holding the throne. An empress's offspring does not have claim to the throne from the said maternal lineage, so assigning a female to the throne had the convenient effect of postponing succession disputes.\n\nOn other occasions, the direct male heir was yet a toddler and unable to perform imperial rituals. In such instance, his mother, aunt or elder sister, if also held Imperial lineage through her patriline, temporarily took over the throne until the child came to puberty, which was deemed sufficient for a boy's accession.\n\nAfter the Meiji Restoration, Japan imported the Prussian model of imperial succession, in which princesses were explicitly excluded from succession. More significantly, as a part of the effort to westernise and modernise Japan, the Japanese government banned polygamy, which was previously allowed to any family with noble rank (samurai or kuge), particularly if the first wife could not produce male offspring. After World War II, a further restriction was instituted. New rules meant that only the closest relatives of the then emperor Hirohito (children and descendants, siblings and their descendants) could be part of the official Imperial family, and have a claim to succession.\n\nThe current emperor, Akihito, has two sons: Crown Prince Naruhito and Prince Akishino; Prince Akishino is the father of the Emperor's only grandson, Prince Hisahito. The Emperor's brother Prince Hitachi has no children. The Emperor's late uncle Prince Mikasa has no male-line grandsons.\n\nControversy exists as to what extent the current rule of succession under \"the Imperial Household Act of 1947\" should be changed. Those on the Right advocate a change, holding the Prussian-style agnatic primogeniture, but bringing back the previously excluded male relatives into the Imperial household. Liberals advocate the adoption of absolute primogeniture. Moderates advocate re-adoption of earlier, indigenous customs of succession, that is, that a female can succeed to the throne as long as she holds precedence in seniority or proximity within the patrilineal kinship. Princess Takamatsu, the last surviving Arisugawa-Takamatsu and aunt to the current Emperor, advocated the traditional, customary rights of female princesses to succession, in her media interviews and articles, after the birth of Princess Aiko.\n\nAdoption of absolute primogeniture would permit, as has happened in history, unmarried or widowed female descendants in the male line of the Imperial House to inherit the Chrysanthemum Throne, but would also allow something unprecedented: it would allow married princesses and princesses' children whose fathers are not descendants in the male line of the earlier emperors, to ascend the throne. This scenario could be interpreted as meaning a new dynasty would take over the Chrysanthemum Throne, since dynasties are traditionally defined patrilineally. However, there is modern precedent for the children of a reigning queen to be considered as continuing her dynasty and not that of their father, including the Dutch House of Orange.\n\nEight women have served as \"tennō\", \"i.e.\" reigning empresses, during the recorded history of Japan on ten occasions. Two of those empresses have, after abdicating, reascended the throne under different names. The last time Japan had a reigning Empress was in 1771, when Empress Go-Sakuramachi abdicated in favor of her nephew, Emperor Go-Momozono.\n\nThe ruling empresses have been:\n\nWomen were barred from the throne for the first time in 1889 by a Prussian-influenced constitution during the 19th century Meiji Restoration. This prohibition was continued by the Imperial Household Act of 1947, enacted under Japan's post-World War II constitution during the American occupation. More importantly, as a part of reforming Japan, Japan introduced a ban on polygyny and the Meiji Emperor was the last to have an official secondary consort.\n\nThe 1947 law further restricts the succession to legitimate male descendants in the male line of Emperor Taishō only (excluding other male lines of the imperial dynasty, such as Fushimi, Higashikuni, Kitashirakawa, etc.), and specifically bars the emperor and other members of the imperial family from adopting children. During the recent controversy over the succession, commentators suggested that the current system could not possibly function in the long term as it is unlikely that there will always be a male heir to succeed to the throne.\n\nCrown Prince Naruhito and Crown Princess Masako have one child, Princess Aiko, born on December 1, 2001. The child's birth, which occurred more than eight years after her parents' marriage and after the Crown Princess had considerable (and widely noted) difficulty in conceiving a child, sparked a lively debate in Japan about imperial succession. To add to this dearth of male heirs, Crown Prince Naruhito's brother, Prince Akishino, had only two daughters, Princess Mako of Akishino, born on October 23, 1991, and Princess Kako of Akishino, born December 29, 1994.\n\nThe two other collateral members of the Imperial Family also had only daughters. The late Prince Tomohito of Mikasa had two daughters, Princess Akiko of Mikasa, born December 20, 1981, and Princess Yōko of Mikasa, born October 25, 1983. The late Prince Takamado had three daughters, Princess Tsuguko of Takamado, born March 8, 1986, Princess Noriko of Takamado, born July 22, 1988, and Princess Ayako of Takamado born September 15, 1990. No male heir had been born into the Imperial Family in nearly 41 years.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the succession controversy emerged as a political issue. The \"Asahi Shimbun\" published an editorial in May 2006 suggesting that the current system was unsustainable. In an \"Asahi Shimbun\" survey in March 2006, 82% of the respondents supported the revision of the Imperial Household Law to allow a woman to ascend to the Imperial Throne. Then Prime Minister Junichirō Koizumi also strongly supported the revision, pledging to present a bill to the 2006 session of the parliament.\n\nSome conservative lawmakers opposed Koizumi and said the debate was premature. The current emperor's cousin, Prince Tomohito of Mikasa, also opposed the proposal, saying that the official male members of the Japanese imperial family might take up concubines in order to produce male members because it was previously possible for a male illegitimate child to assume the imperial throne. Later he said that this remark was just a joke. Another solution would be to restore the Shinnoke (agnatic collateral branches of the imperial dynasty which had been disinherited by the United States) to the line of succession.\n\nPrince Akishino's wife, Princess Kiko, gave birth to a baby boy on September 6, 2006. The child, Prince Hisahito, is now third in line to the Imperial Throne. Following the birth of Prince Hisahito, the political debate surrounding succession subsided. Koizumi withdrew his bill, though public opinion polling suggested that support for the change was still around 68%.\n\n\n"}

During World War II, it became the senior intelligence assessment body in the UK. In 1957 the JIC moved to the Cabinet Office, where its assessments staff prepare draft intelligence assessments for the committee to consider.\n\nThe JIC recently played a controversial role in compiling a dossier in which the UK government set out the threat posed by Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction in the run up to war. There were allegations that the dossier was \"sexed up\" prior to publication in order to bolster the case for military action. Evidence that the wording of the dossier was \"strengthened\" was presented to the Hutton Inquiry, a judicial review set up to investigate the circumstances leading up to the death of an eminent government weapons expert, David Kelly, who had criticised the wording of the dossier in off-the-record briefings to journalists. Dr. Kelly committed suicide shortly after his identity was confirmed to the media by the government. JIC members John Scarlett and Sir Richard Dearlove (both then head of MI6, the Secret Intelligence Service) gave evidence to the Inquiry in which they argued that the words used in the dossier were consistent with their assessment of the intelligence available at the time.\n\nDespite the work of the 1400 strong Iraq Survey Group in post-war Iraq, no evidence of actual WMD capability has so far been uncovered; according to its final report in September 2004. The US and UK Governments both announced investigations into the assessment of WMD intelligence in the run up to war. The British inquiry, headed by Lord Butler of Brockwell, in its report in July 2004, while critical of the British intelligence community, did not recommend that anyone should resign.

Dieter Simon (1980-2001), Walter Wilhelm (1980-1987), Michael Stolleis (1991-2006) and Marie Theres Fögen (2001-2008) later became directors of the institute. After having retired in 2006 again Michael Stolleis became Managing Director of the MPIeR until 2009. In 2010 Thomas Duve, the new director and Scientific Member, took over the institute's management. In 2014, Stefan Vogenauer joined the Directorate and has been acting as Managing Director since 2016. Currently, Thomas Duve, Dieter Simon, Michael Stolleis and Stefan Vogenauer are Scientific Members of the institute. Knut Wolfgang Knörr is an External Scientific Member at the MPIeR.\n\nUnder Helmut Coing the research focus of the MPIeR was placed on the history of private law in Europe and its correlation to economic history. Dieter Simon, Walter Wilhelm, Michael Stolleis and Marie Theres Fögen gradually broadened the research scope of the institute to the theory and sociology of law, the history of public law, international law, criminal law, the law of modern Eastern Europe and the Europe of Dictatorship in the 20th century. Today, Thomas Duve and Stefan Vogenauer focus on the transnational approach to European Legal History by pursuing research in the fields of Global History and Comparative Law. The current research profile comprises four research areas which are Multinormativity, Translation, Legal Spaces and Conflict Regulation. In addition, 14 special research fields add to the institute's profile. These are Legal Historiography, Sources, History of Private Law, History of Criminal Law and Criminal Justice, Legal History of the Church, Regulating Regimes, History of Legal Methods and Practices, Legal History of the European Union, Legal Transfer in the Common Law World, Legal History of Ibero-America, Law as a Civilising Factor in the First Millennium, the Legal History of the School of Salamanca, Governance of the Universal Church after the Council of Trent as well as Law and Diversity.

During the past fifty years the institute has turned into one of the central research hubs for the worldwide scientific community concerned with investigating our past and present national and transnational legal orders.\n\nCollaboration in the Rhein-Main region, in particular with the Goethe University Frankfurt, plays an important role. Via the Cluster of Excellence entitled \"The Formation of Normative Orders\" or the Collaborative Research Center called \"Discourses of weakness and Resource Regimes\" the institute and the university jointly contribute to create a sustainable research site on normativity. Together they also established \"The School of Salamanca\" as long-term research project at the Academia of Science and Literature Mainz and thereby managed to combine research perspectives in the fields of legal history and philosophy.\n\nSince 2002 the institute's journal \"Rechtsgeschichte\" appears annually in print (Klostermann Verlag) and is simultaneously available through open access since 2012. Its predecessors were IUS COMMUNE, journal for European legal history (1967-2001), and the Rechtshistorisches Journal (journal on legal history, 1982-2001). Research results of the institute are also published as working papers, pre-print editions or in a post-print format in the Legal History Research Paper Series, which has appeared online as SSRN since 2012.

The individual faced disciplinary action for his participation in this demonstration, as well as for a politically charged email he sent to a Marine officer. However, in this case, the service member avoided the other than honorable discharge being sought by the military due to the First Amendment arguments posed on his behalf.

Johnson that established the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA). Title III of the Act set rules for obtaining wiretap orders in the United States. It had been started shortly after November 22, 1963 when evidence in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy increased public alertness to the relative lack of control over the sale and possession of guns in the United States. The act was a major accomplishment of Johnson's war on crime.\n\nThe LEAA, which was superseded by the Office of Justice Programs, provided federal grant funding for criminology and criminal justice research, much of which focused on social aspects of crime. Research grants were also provided to develop alternative sanctions for punishment of young offenders. Block grants were provided to the states, with $100 million in funding. Within that amount, $50 million was earmarked for assistance to local law enforcement agencies, which included funds to deal with riot control and organized crime.\n\nThe Omnibus Crime Bill also prohibited interstate trade in handguns and increased the minimum age to 21 for buying handguns. This legislation was soon followed by the Gun Control Act of 1968, which set forth additional gun control restrictions.\n\nThe wiretapping section of the bill was passed in part as a response to the U.S. Supreme Court decisions \"Berger v. New York\", 388 U.S. 41 (1967) and \"Katz v. United States\", 389 U.S. 347 (1967), which both limited the power of the government to obtain information from citizens without their consent, based on the protections under the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. In the \"Katz\" decision, the Court \"extended the Fourth Amendment protection from unreasonable search and seizure to protect individuals with a 'reasonable expectation of privacy.'\"\n\nSection 2511(3) of the Crime Control Bill specifies that nothing in the act or the Federal Communications Act of 1934 shall limit the constitutional power of the President \"\"to take such measures as he deems necessary\":\n\nThe section also limits use in evidence only where the interception was reasonable and prohibits disclosure except for purpose.\n\nIn 1975, the United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, (known as the \"Church Committee\") was established to investigate abuses by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), National Security Agency (NSA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In 1975 and 1976, the Church Committee published 14 reports on various U.S. intelligence agencies' operations, and a report on the FBI's COINTELPRO program stated that \"the Fourth Amendment did apply to searches and seizures of conversations and protected all conversations of an individual as to which he had a reasonable expectation of privacy...At no time, however, were the Justice Department's standards and procedures ever applied to NSA's electronic monitoring system and its 'watch listing' of American citizens. From the early 1960s until 1973, NSA compiled a list of individuals and organizations, including 1200 American citizens and domestic groups, whose communications were segregated from the mass of communications intercepted by the Agency, transcribed, and frequently disseminated to other agencies for intelligence purposes\".\n\nThe Act prohibits \"employers from listening to the private telephone conversations of employees or disclosing the contents of these conversations.\" Employers can ban personal phone calls and can monitor calls for compliance provided they stop listening as soon as a personal conversation begins. Violations carry fines up to $10,000. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 expanded these protections to electronic and cell phone communication. \"See also Employee monitoring and Workplace privacy\".\n\nThe bill increased the FBI budget by 10% to fund police training at the FBI National Academy. Much of this training was for riot control, a popular political issue at the time.\n\nIn 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court decision in \"Miranda v. Arizona\" (384 U.S. 436) created the requirement that a citizen must be informed of their legal rights upon their arrest and before they are interrogated, which came to be known as Miranda warnings. Responding to various complaints that such warnings allowed too many criminals go free, Congress, in provisions codified under 18 U.S.C. § 3501 with a clear intent to reverse the effect of the court ruling, included a provision in the Crime Control Act directing federal trial judges to admit statements of criminal defendants if they were made voluntarily, without regard to whether he had received the Miranda warnings.\n\nThe stated criteria for voluntary statements depended on such things as:\n\nIt also provided that the \"presence or absence of any of\" the factors \"need not be conclusive on the issue of voluntariness of the confession.\" (As a federal statute, it applied only to criminal proceedings either under federal laws, or in the District of Columbia.)\n\nThat provision was disallowed by a federal appeals court decision that was not appealed, and it escaped Supreme Court review until 32 years after passage, when another appeals court (the Fourth Circuit, covering states from South Carolina to Maryland) failed to follow suit and reversed one of its district courts in \"Dickerson v. United States\". It reasoned, following a paper by University of Utah law professor Paul G. Cassell, that Miranda was not a constitutional requirement, that Congress could therefore overrule it by legislation, and that the provision had supplanted the requirement that police give Miranda warnings.\n\nThe Supreme Court then agreed to hear the case. Typically, it overrules constitutional decisions only when their doctrinal underpinnings have eroded, and the majority justices found, in 2000, that it had intended \"Miranda\" as an interpretation of the Constitution and that if \"anything, our subsequent cases have reduced the impact of the Miranda rule on legitimate law enforcement while reaffirming the decision's core ruling that unwarned statements may not be used as evidence in the prosecution's case in chief.\"\n\n\n"}

The operation was the first time active-duty troops were used to combat marijuana growing in the United States.\n\nOn July 29, 1990 a joint task force converged at a base camp in Humboldt County for what is known as 'Operation Green Sweep'. The operation was led by the Bureau of Land Management and consisted of approximately 60 drug law enforcement agents, 110 California National Guardsmen and 60 regular U.S. Army soldiers from the 7th Infantry Division, the same unit that was used in the invasion of Panama during the previous December. This marked the first time that the government had ever used military force against its own citizens in a drug operation. It also established that law enforcement officials--now cooperating with U.S. military forces --have the ability to search, seize and detain, without warrant or probable cause, in the war on drugs. Property may be seized regardless of evidence and forfeited to the state or federal government without regards to the Fourth Amendment. \n\nA contingent of 200 military troops conducted a massive marijuana eradication program where military helicopters flew overhead surveying residents, homes, and fields, and conducted road blocks, interrogations, and detentions. Violent demonstrations by Humboldt County locals against Green Sweep broke out. The first day of the raid resulted in the seizure of 200 marijuana plants and 700 pounds of farming equipment. In addition, three arrests for trespassing were made by BLM at the base camp (a diversion for others to photograph the camp). Two eradication teams were deployed the very next day and seized a further 523 plants.\n\nEradication continued on August 1, resulting in 683 plants and 2.6 tons of growing paraphernalia confiscated from the local farmers. Local citizens began attempts to disrupt military communications in order to slow the progress of the raid, the military responded by introducing code words into Task Force radio nets. The operation continued several more days in August. The public continued to protest (sometimes violently) the actions of the military and federal officials. On August 3, local residents threatened a military laundry unit with a pistol and another group fired shots at a UH-60 helicopter. \n\nThough the operation was scheduled to continue until August 10th all operations ceased on August 5, most likely due to the escalating demonstrations. The results from the property seized during Operation Green Sweep were: 1400 marijuana plants (worth approximately $2000 each) and 12 tons of growing equipment. \n\n"}

This initiative was adopted at the International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM), which took place from 4–6 February 2006 in Dubai gathering Governments and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations. It defines a policy framework to foster the sound worldwide management of chemicals. \nThis initiative covers risk assessments of chemicals and harmonized labeling up to tackling obsolete and stockpiled products. Are included provisions for national centres aimed at helping in the developing world, train staff in chemical safety as well as dealing with spills and accidents. SAICM is a voluntary agreement. \nA second International Conference on Chemicals Management -ICCM2- held in May 2009 in Geneva took place in order to enhance synergies and cost effectiveness and to promote SAICM’s multi-sectorial nature.\n\nGlobally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS)[]\nThe “Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals” (GHS) proposes harmonised hazard communication elements, including labels and safety data sheets. It was adopted by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) in 2002. This system aims to ensure a better protection of human health and the environment during the handling of chemicals, including their transport and use. The classification of chemicals is done based on their hazard. This harmonisation will facilitate trade when implemented entirely.\n\nStockholm Convention - \nThe Stockholm Convention is a global treaty to protect human health and the environment from persistent organic pollutants(POPs).

{"id": "4426917", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4426917", "title": "Representative assembly", "text": "Representative assembly\n\nA representative assembly is a political institution in which a number of persons representing the population or privileged orders within the population of a state come together to debate, negotiate with the executive (originally the king or other ruler) and legislate. Examples in English-speaking countries are the United States Congress and the Parliament of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe classical republics of Greece, Rome and Carthage included citizen assemblies (e.g. the Roman \"comitia\"). Popular assemblies (\"things\") also emerged in pre-civilised Germanic and Scandinavian lands (and the modern assemblies in those countries are often named after the originals). However, all of these were \"direct\" rather than \"indirect\" expressions of democracy, since their members were the people themselves rather than representatives of the people. The idea of an assembly of representatives, a \"representative assembly\", as a political institution of a literate society first appeared in Europe in the Middle Ages, more specifically in the twelfth to fifteenth centuries. Perhaps it was brought into being by rulers determined to avoid being overawed by their powerful warrior barons by appealing to lower ranks of society: lesser landowners, townsmen and clergy. Whatever the explanation for its emergence, it is considered by many to be the most important political innovation of the European Middle Ages.\n\nThe idea appeared first in Spain, then in England, France and Italy, then spread to Germany and Scandinavia, even Poland and Hungary. Various names were used for these institutions: in England, Ireland, Scotland, Sicily, the Papal States and the Kingdom of Naples they were called parliaments or \"parlamenti\"; in the Iberian peninsula they were called \"cortes\" or \"corts\"; in France they were called estates-general and in the Low Countries the estates- or states-general; in Germany the term used was \"landtag\"; in Denmark and Norway it was \"rigsdag\", in Sweden \"riksdag\", and in Poland \"sejm\".\n\nThe number of chambers roughly corresponded to the organised orders or estates of mediaeval society: typically the church, the nobility, and the rest of society. Sometimes however (as in Spain and Portugal) the gentry or lesser nobility formed a separate order; sometimes (as in Sweden) the richer peasantry did likewise. The English parliament, which was to be an important example, was a deviant case in that only two orders were represented: the nobility and the rest.\n\nThe representative assembly fell into disuse in many of the more important states of Europe in the seventeenth century. However, it survived in England, Sweden, Poland, Hungary and many of the German statelets, the southern ones particularly. In the eighteenth century, the English parliament was effectively transplanted to the United States, and in the nineteenth century it evolved there in an increasingly democratic direction. The American variant propagated in due course to Latin America, but meanwhile in Europe there was a general revival of the representative assembly based principally on the English model. France revived its Estates General in the wake of its revolution. Later, after the disintegration of the empire of Napoleon Bonaparte, assemblies re-emerged in Sweden, the Netherlands, France and Spain. The British Empire especially at the time of its dismantlement in the twentieth century was instrumental in spreading parliamentary democracy far and wide, and in modern times the immense international influence of the United States has encouraged the spread of representative democracy worldwide.\n\nWhere forms of representative democracy have spread to countries that already had a tradition of assemblies, a merger of ideas has often taken place and the traditional name has tended to be used. Examples include \"majlis\" in certain Muslim countries, \"jirga\" in Afghanistan, \"duma\" in Russia. See list of national legislatures for more examples.\n\nIn Galicia in 1113, Bishop Diego II of Santiago de Compostela ordered a monthly convening of \"councils\" in the regions of his bishopric “as it was the custom of our ancestors”, bringing together churchmen, knights ('milites') and peasants to do justice, in what has been interpreted as a continuation of old Celtic or Suevi local traditions. Later, in 1188, King Ferdinand II of León and Galicia called for a general council of his kingdoms to meet in the capital, León, bringing together bishops, nobility and – allegedly for the first time in European history – representatives of the major cities and towns.\n\nIn more modern times, the supremacy of the lower chamber became normal, so did the organisation of representatives into competing parties, so did election and an extended franchise, so did the idea that the ministers of the executive should be responsible to it.\n\nFor more details on the state of the institution in the modern world, consult the \"See also\" list below.\n\n\n"}

The neutral zone came into existence following the Uqair Protocol of 1922 which defined the border between Iraq and the Sultanate of Nejd (Saudi Arabia's predecessor state). The neutral zone officially ended in 1981, when Iraq and Saudi Arabia agreed on the partition of the zone.\n\nThe Treaty of Muhammarah (Khorramshahr), 5 May 1922, forestalled the imminent conflict between the United Kingdom, which held the mandate for Iraq, and the Kingdom of Nejd, which later became Saudi Arabia (when combined with the Kingdom of Hejaz). The treaty specifically avoided defining boundaries. Following further negotiations, the Protocol of Uqair (Uqayr), 2 December 1922, defined most of the borders between them and created the neutral zone.\n\nNo military or permanent buildings were to be built in or near the neutral zone and the nomads of both countries were to have unimpeded access to its pastures and wells.\n\nAdministrative division of the zone was achieved in 1975, and a border treaty concluded in 1981. For unknown reasons, the treaty was not filed with the United Nations and nobody outside Iraq and Saudi Arabia was notified of the change or shown maps with details of the new boundary. As the Persian Gulf War approached in early 1991, Iraq cancelled all international agreements with Saudi Arabia since 1968. Saudi Arabia responded by registering all previous boundary agreements negotiated with Iraq at the United Nations in June 1991. That ended the legal existence of the Saudi Arabian–Iraqi neutral zone.\n\nMost official maps no longer show the diamond-shaped neutral zone but rather draw the border line approximately through the centre of the territory. For example, the United States Office of the Geographer regarded the area as having only an approximate boundary rather than a precise one.\n\nThe Saudi Arabian–Iraqi neutral zone formerly had the ISO 3166-1 codes NT and NTZ. The codes were discontinued in 1993. The FIPS 10-4 code for the Saudi Arabian–Iraqi neutral zone was IY; that code was deleted in 1992.\n\n\n"}

This law added sexual orientation as a protected status in housing, employment, and public accommodations. This movement was lead by Equality Florida's leader Nadine Smith, which took years to pass due to overruling in city meetings. Equality Florida is an advocacy group that advocates for equal LGBTQ rights for all Florida residents. This organization played a heavy hand in passing the first St. Petersburg Human rights ordinance .\n\nFor the years leading up to this event, the offices of St. Petersburg were consistently receiving mail from communities in an effort to address the city's failure to protect the LGBTQ community from discrimination. The bill to pass sexual orientation as an addition to the human rights ordinance was previously denied in a county commissioners meeting in 2001. This means that discrimination against age, race, and gender was still prohibited in the workplace, real estate and in public, but sexual orientation is excluded from this law. While supporters argued that this ordinance offers further protection in addition to civil rights laws, opposers of this ordinance argued that the city shouldn't have to further protect those with \"alternate lifestyles\". It wasn't until January of 2002 that the human right ordinance law was passed which protected discrimination against rage, gender, age AND sexual orientation in St. Petersburg.

More recent interpretations focus on its context as part of the Holiness Code, a code of purity meant to distinguish the behavior of Israelites from the polytheistic Canaanites.\n\nThe story of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah in Genesis does not explicitly identify homosexuality as the sin for which they were destroyed. Some interpreters find the story of Sodom and a similar one in Judges 19 to condemn the violent rape of guests more than homosexuality, but the passage has historically been interpreted within Judaism and Christianity as a punishment for homosexuality due to the interpretation that the men of Sodom wished to rape the angels who retrieved Lot.\n\nWhile the Jewish prophets spoke only of lack of charity as the sin of Sodom, the exclusively sexual interpretation became so prevalent among Christian communities that the name \"Sodom\" became the basis of the word \"sodomy\", still a legal synonym for homosexual and non-procreative sexual acts, particularly anal or oral sex.\n\nWhile the Jewish prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Amos and Zephaniah refer vaguely to the sin of Sodom, Ezekiel specifies that the city was destroyed because of its commission of social injustice:\nThe Talmudic tradition as written between c. 370 and 500 also interprets the sin of Sodom as lack of charity, with the attempted rape of the angels being a manifestation of the city's violation of the social order of hospitality; as does Jesus in the New Testament, for instance in Matthew 10:14–15 when he tells his disciples that the punishment for houses or towns that will not welcome them will be worse than that of Sodom and Gomorrah.\n\nLater traditions on Sodom's sin, such as \"Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs\", considered it to be an illicit form of heterosexual intercourse. In Jude 1:7 the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah are stated to have been \"giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh\", which may refer to homosexuality or to the lust of mortals after angels. Jewish writers Philo (d. AD 50) and Josephus (37 – c. 100) were the first to assert unambiguously that homosexuality was among the sins of Sodom. By the end of the 1st century Jews commonly identified the sin of Sodom with homosexual practices.\n\nThe account of the friendship between David and Jonathan in the Books of Samuel has been interpreted by traditional and mainstream Christians as a relationship only of affectionate regard, but has been interpreted by some authors as of a sexual nature.\n\nOne relevant Bible passage on this issue is 1 Samuel 18:1:\nAnother relevant passage is 2 Samuel 1:26, where David says:\n\nThe story of Ruth and Naomi in the Book of Ruth is also occasionally interpreted by contemporary scholars as the story of a lesbian couple.\n\nThis passage has been debated by some 20th and 21st-century interpreters as to its relevance today and as to what it actually prohibits: although Christians of several denominations have historically maintained that this verse is a complete prohibition of all forms of homosexual activity, some 20th and 21st-century authors contend the passage is not a blanket condemnation of homosexual acts, suggesting, among other interpretations, that the passage condemned heterosexuals who experimented with homosexual activity or that Paul's condemnation was relative to his own culture, in which homosexuality was not understood as an orientation and in which being penetrated was seen as shameful. These interpretations are in a minority. Several scholars believe these verses are part of a much larger non-Pauline interpolation, a later addition to the letter.\n\nIn the context of the broader immorality of his audience, Paul the Apostle wrote in the First Epistle to the Corinthians, chapter 6 verses 9-11,\n\nThe Greek word \"arsenokoitai\" () in verse 9 has been debated for some time, and has been variously rendered as \"abusers of themselves with mankind\" (KJV), \"sodomites\" (YLT), or \"men who have sex with men\" (NIV). Greek [\"arrhēn\" / \"arsēn\"] means \"male\", and [\"koitēn\"] \"bed\", with a sexual connotation. Paul's use of the word in 1 Corinthians is the earliest example of the term; its only other usage is in a similar list of wrongdoers given (possibly by the same author) in 1 Timothy 1:8–11:\nIn the letter to the Corinthians, within the list of people who will not inherit the kingdom of God, Paul uses two Greek words: \"malakoi\" and \"arsenokoitai\". \"Malakoi\" is a common Greek word meaning, of things subject to touch, \"soft\" (used in Matthew 11:8 and Luke 7:25 to describe a garment); of things not subject to touch, \"gentle\"; and, of persons or modes of life, a number of meanings that include \"pathic\". Nowhere else in scripture is malakoi used to describe a person. \n\nBishop Gene Robinson says the early church seemed to have understood it as a person with a \"soft\" or weak morality; later, it would come to denote (and be translated as) those who engage in masturbation, or \"those who abuse themselves\"; all we actually, factually, know about the word is that it means soft.\n\nMost scholars hold that Paul had two passages of the Book of Leviticus, and , in mind when he used the word ἀρσενοκοῖται, which may be of his coinage. with most commentators and translators interpreting it as a reference to male same-sex intercourse. However, John Boswell states that it \"did not connote homosexuality to Paul or his early readers\", and that in later Christian literature the word is used, for instance, by Aristides of Athens (c. 138) clearly not for homosexuality and possibly for prostitution, Eusebius (d. c. 340) who evidently used it in reference to women, and in the writings of 6th-century Patriarch John IV of Constantinople, known as John the Faster. In a passage dealing with sexual misconduct, John speaks of \"arsenokoitia\" as active or passive and says that \"many men even commit the sin of \"arsenokoitia\" with their wives\". Although the constituent elements of the compound word refer to sleeping with men, he obviously does not use it to mean homosexual intercourse and appears to employ it for anal intercourse, not generic homosexual activity. Particulars of Boswell's arguments are rejected by several scholars in a way qualified as persuasive by David F. Greenberg, who declares usage of the term \"arsenokoites\" by writers such as Aristides of Athens and Eusebius, and in the Sibylline Oracles, to be \"consistent with a homosexual meaning\". A discussion document issued by the House of Bishops of the Church of England states that most scholars still hold that the word \"arsenokoites\" relates to homosexuality. Another work attributed to John the Faster, a series of canons that for various sins provided shorter though stricter penances in place of the previous longer penances, applies a penance of eighty days for \"intercourse of men with one another\" (canon 9), explained in the \"Pedalion\" as mutual masturbation – double the penalty for solitary masturbation (canon 8) – and three years with xerophagy or, in accordance with the older canon of Basil the Great, fifteen without (canon 18) for being \"so mad as to copulate with another man\" – ἀρρενομανήσαντα in the original – explained in the \"Pedalion\" as \"guilty of arsenocoetia (i.e., sexual intercourse between males)\" – ἀρσενοκοίτην in the original. According to the same work, ordination is not to be conferred on someone who as a boy has been the victim of anal intercourse, but this is not the case if the semen was ejaculated between his thighs (canon 19). These canons are included, with commentary, in the \"Pedalion\", the most widely used collection of canons of the Greek Orthodox Church, an English translation of which was produced by Denver Cummings and published by the Orthodox Christian Educational Society in 1957 under the title, \"The Rudder\".\n\nSome scholars consider that the term was not used to refer to a homosexual orientation, but argue that it referred instead to sexual activity.\n\nOther scholars have interpreted \"arsenokoitai\" and \"malakoi\" (another word that appears in ) as referring to weakness and effeminacy or to the practice of exploitative pederasty.\n\nIn Matthew 19:3, Jesus is asked if a man can divorce his wife. In that context,\n\nRobert Gagnon, an associate professor of New Testament studies, argues that Jesus's back-to-back references to Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 show that he \"presupposed a two-sex requirement for marriage\".\n\nIn Matthew 8:5–13 and Luke 7:1–10, Jesus heals a centurion's servant who is dying. According to James Neill, the Greek term \"pais\" used for the servant in Matthew's account almost always had a sexual connotation. In support of this view, he remarks that the word \"pais\", along with the word \"erasthai\" (to love) is the root of the English word \"pederasty\". He sees in the fact that, in Luke's parallel account, the centurion's servant is described as \"valued highly\" by the centurion an indication of a homosexual relationship between the two, and says that the Greek word \"doulos\" (a slave) used of him in Luke's account suggests he may have been a sex slave. Daniel A. Helminiak writes that the word \"pais\" was sometimes given a sexual meaning. Donald Wold states that its normal meaning is \"boy\", \"child\" or \"slave\" and its application to a boy lover escapes notice in the standard lexica of Liddell and Scott and Bauer. The Greek-English Lexicon of Liddell and Scott registers three meanings of the word παῖς (\"pais\"): a child in relation to descent (son or daughter); a child in relation to age (boy or girl); a slave or servant (male or female). In her detailed study of the episode in Matthew and Luke, Wendy Cotter dismisses as very unlikely the idea that the use of the Greek word \"pais\" indicated a sexual relationship between the centurion and the young slave. Neill himself compares the meanings of Greek \"pais\" to those of French \"garçon\", which \"most commonly means 'boy'\" even though it can also be used to mean \"waiter\".\n\nMatthew's account has parallels in Luke 7:1–10 and John 4:46–53. There are major differences between John's account and those of the two synoptic writers, but such differences exist also between the two synoptic accounts, with next to nothing of the details in Luke 7:2–6 being present also in Matthew. The Commentary of Craig A. Evans states that the word \"pais\" used by Matthew may be that used in the hypothetical source known as Q used by both Matthew and Luke and, since it can mean either son or slave, it became \"doulos\" (slave) in Luke and \"huios\" (son) in John. Writers who admit John 4:46–53 as a parallel passage generally interpret Matthew's \"pais\" as \"child\" or \"boy\", while those who exclude it see it as meaning \"servant\" or \"slave\".\n\nTheodore W. Jennings Jr. and Tat-Siong Benny Liew write that Roman historical data about patron-client relationships and about same-sex relations among soldiers support the view that the \"pais\" in Matthew's account is the centurion's \"boy-love\" and that the centurion did not want Jesus to enter his house for fear the boy would be enamoured of Jesus instead. D.B. Saddington writes that while he does not exclude the possibility, the evidence the two put forward supports \"neither of these interpretations\", with Stephen Voorwinde saying of their view that \"the argument on which this understanding is based has already been soundly refuted in the scholarly literature\" and Wendy Cotter saying that they fail to take account of Jewish condemnation of pederasty. Others interpret Matthew's \"pais\" merely as a boy servant, not a male lover, and read nothing sexual into Luke's \"valued highly\".\n\nIn Matthew 19:12, Jesus speaks of eunuchs who were born as such, eunuchs who were made so by others, and eunuchs who choose to live as such for the kingdom of heaven. Jesus's reference to eunuchs who were born as such has been interpreted by some commentators as having to do with homosexual orientation; Clement of Alexandria, for instance, is citing in his book \"Stromata\" (chapter III,1,1) an earlier interpretation from Basilides on it that some men, from birth, are naturally averse to women and should not marry. \"The first category – those eunuchs who have been so from birth – is the closest description we have in the Bible of what we understand today as homosexual.\"\n\nThe Ethiopian eunuch, an early gentile convert described in Acts 8, has been interpreted by some commentators as an early gay Christian, based on the fact that the word \"eunuch\" in the Bible was not always used literally, as in Matthew 19:12. Religious commentators generally suggest that the combination of \"eunuch\" together with the title \"court official\" indicates a literal eunuch — not a homosexual — who would have been excluded from the Temple by the restriction in Deuteronomy 23:1.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2180530", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2180530", "title": "The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power", "text": "The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power\n\n\"The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power\" is an article, written in 1991 by U.S. investigative journalist Richard Behar, which is highly critical of Scientology.\n\nIt was first published by \"Time\" magazine on May 6, 1991, as an eight-page cover story, and was later published in \"Reader's Digest\" in October 1991. Behar had previously published an article on Scientology in \"Forbes\" magazine. He stated that he was investigated by attorneys and private investigators affiliated with the Church of Scientology while researching the \"Time\" article, and that investigators contacted his friends and family as well. Behar's article covers topics including L. Ron Hubbard and the development of Scientology, its controversies over the years and history of litigation, conflict with psychiatry and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, the suicide of Noah Lottick, its status as a religion, and its business dealings.\n\nAfter the article's publication, the Church of Scientology mounted a public relations campaign to address issues in the piece. It took out advertisements in \"USA Today\" for twelve weeks, and Church leader David Miscavige was interviewed by Ted Koppel on \"Nightline\" about what he considered to be an objective bias by the article's author. Miscavige alleged that the article was actually driven by the company Eli Lilly, because of Scientology's efforts against the drug Prozac. The Church of Scientology brought a libel suit against Time Warner and Behar, and sued \"Reader's Digest\" in multiple countries in Europe in an attempt to stop the article's publication there. The suit against Time Warner was dismissed in 1996, and the Church of Scientology's petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States was denied in 2001.\n\nBehar received awards in honor of his work on the article, including the Gerald Loeb Award, the Worth Bingham Prize, and the Conscience-in-Media Award. The article has had ramifications in the current treatment of Scientology in the media, with some publications theorizing that journalists are wary of the litigation that Time Warner went through. The article has been cited by Anderson Cooper on CNN, in a story on \"Panorama\" 2007 program \"Scientology and Me\" on the BBC, and has been used as a reference for background on the history of Scientology, in books from both the cult and new religious movement perspectives.\n\nBefore penning \"The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power\", Behar had written a 1986 article in \"Forbes\" magazine, \"The Prophet and Profits of Scientology\", which reported on the Church of Scientology's business dealings and L. Ron Hubbard's financial success. Behar wrote that during research for \"The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power\", he and a \"Time\" contributing editor were themselves investigated by ten attorneys and six private investigators affiliated with the Church of Scientology. According to Behar, investigators contacted his friends and previous coworkers to ask them if he had a history of tax or drug problems, and obtained a copy of his personal credit report that had been obtained illegally from a national credit bureau. Behar conducted 150 interviews in the course of his research for the article.\n\nBehar wrote that the motive of these operatives was to \"threaten, harass and discredit him\". He later learned that the Church of Scientology had assigned its head private investigator to direct the Church's investigation into Behar. \"Anderson Cooper 360°\" reported that Behar had been contacted by Church of Scientology attorneys numerous times while doing research on the article. The parents of Noah Lottick, a Scientologist who had committed suicide, cooperated with \"Time\" and \"Reader's Digest\".\n\nThe full title of the article is \"The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power: Ruined lives. Lost fortunes. Federal crimes. Scientology poses as a religion but is really a ruthless global scam — and aiming for the mainstream\". The article reported on the founding of the Church of Scientology by L. Ron Hubbard and controversies involving the Church and its affiliated business operations, as well as the suicide of a Scientologist. The article related the May 11, 1990, suicide of Dr. Edward Lottick's son Noah Antrim Lottick. Lottick was a Russian studies student who had taken a series of Scientology courses; he died after jumping from a hotel tenth floor window. The Church of Scientology and Lottick's family have differing positions on the effect Scientology coursework had on him. While none of the parties assigned blame, they expressed misgivings about his death. Initially, his father had thought that Scientology was similar to Dale Carnegie's self-improvement techniques; however, after his ordeal, the elder Lottick came to believe that the organization is a \"school for psychopaths\". Mike Rinder, the head of the Church of Scientology's Office of Special Affairs and a Church spokesman, stated \"I think Ed Lottick should look in the mirror ... I think Ed Lottick made his son's life intolerable\".\n\nThe article outlined a brief history of Scientology, discussing Hubbard's initial background as a science fiction writer, and cited a California judge who had deemed Hubbard a \"pathological liar\". The Church of Scientology's litigation history was described, in addition to its conflicts with the Internal Revenue Service, with countries regarding whether or not to accept it as a religion, and its position against psychiatry. Behar wrote of the high costs involved in participation in the Church of Scientology, what he referred to as \"front groups and financial scams\", and harassment of critics. He estimated that the Church of Scientology paid US$20 million annually to over one hundred attorneys. Behar maintained that though the Church of Scientology portrays itself as a religion, it was actually a \"hugely profitable global racket\" which intimidated members and critics in a Mafia-like manner.\n\nCynthia Kisser, then director of the Cult Awareness Network, was quoted: \"Scientology is quite likely the most ruthless, the most classically terroristic, the most litigious and the most lucrative cult the country has ever seen. No cult extracts more money from its members\".\n\nThe Church of Scientology responded to the publication of \"The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power\" by taking out color full-page ads in \"USA Today\" in May and June 1991, on every weekday for twelve weeks, denouncing the \"Time\" magazine cover article. Two official Church of Scientology responses were titled \"Facts vs. Fiction, A Correction of Falsehoods Contained in the May 6, 1991, Issues of \"Time Magazine\"\", and \"The Story That \"Time\" Couldn't Tell\". Prior to the advertising campaign, Scientologists distributed 88-page bound booklets which disputed points from Behar's article. The \"Fact vs. Fiction\" piece was a booklet, which criticized Behar's article and asserted \"Behar's article omits the information on the dozens of community service programs conducted by Scientologists ... which have been acknowledged by community officials\". One of the advertisements in \"USA Today\" accused \"Time\" of promoting Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany, and featured a 1936 issue of \"Time\" which had Hitler's picture on the front cover. The Church of Scientology sent out a news release condemning \"Time\" \"horrible history of supporting fascism\", and said that the article was written because \"Time\" had been pressured by \"vested interests\". When asked by the \"St. Petersburg Times\" whether this was the case, \"Time\" Executive Editor Richard Duncan responded \"Good Lord, no\". Heber Jentzsch, at the time president of Church of Scientology International, issued a four-page news release which stated \"Advertising is the only way the church could be assured of getting its message and its side of the story out to the public without the same vested interests behind the Time article distorting it\".\n\nAfter the advertising run critiquing \"Time\" magazine in \"USA Today\" had completed, the Church of Scientology mounted a $3 million public relations campaign about Scientology in \"USA Today\", in June 1991. The Church of Scientology placed a 48-page advertising supplement in 1.8 million copies of \"USA Today\". In a statement to the \"St. Petersburg Times\", Scientology spokesman Richard Haworth explained \"What we are trying to do is put the actual facts of Dianetics and Scientology out there\".\n\nIn response to the Church of Scientology's claims of inaccuracies in the article, a lawyer for \"Time\" responded \"We've reviewed all of their allegations, and find nothing wrong with the \"Time\" story.\" In June 1991, \"Newsweek\" reported that staffers for \"Time\" said they had received calls from a man claiming to be a paralegal for \"Time\", who asked them if they had signed a confidentiality form about the article. \"Time\" editors sent staffers a computer memo, warning them about calls related to the article, and staffers told \"Newsweek\" that \"sources named in the story say detectives have asked about their talks with Time\". A Church of Scientology spokesman called the claims \"scurrilous\".\n\nOn February 14, 1992, Scientology leader David Miscavige gave Ted Koppel his first interview on Scientology on the ABC News program \"Nightline\". The program noted that Scientology has vocal critics and cited Behar's 1991 article. Behar appeared on the program and gave his opinion of why individuals join Scientology, stating that the organization's \"ulterior motive\" is really to get people to take high-priced audit counseling. Behar stated on the program that he had evidence that members of the Church of Scientology had obtained his personal phone records. Later in the program, Koppel questioned Miscavige on the Church of Scientology's response to the \"Time\" magazine article, particularly the $3 million the church spent advertising in \"USA Today\". Miscavige explained that the first three weeks of the advertising campaign was meant to correct falsehoods from the \"Time\" article, and the rest of the twelve-week campaign was dedicated to informing the public about Scientology. Koppel asked Miscavige what specifically had upset him about the \"Time\" article, and Miscavige called Behar \"a hater\". Miscavige noted that Behar had written an article on Scientology and the Internal Revenue Service three years before he began work on the \"Time\" piece, and made allegations that Behar had attempted to get two Scientologists kidnapped. When Koppel questioned Miscavige further on this, Miscavige said that individuals had contacted Behar after an earlier article, and Behar had told them to \"kidnap Scientologists out\". Koppel pressed further, noting that this was a serious charge to make, and asked Miscavige if his allegations were accurate, why he had not pressed charges for attempted kidnapping. Miscavige said Koppel was \"missing the issue\", and said that his real point was that he thought the article was not an objective piece.\n\nMiscavige alleged on \"Nightline\" that the article itself was published as a result of a request by Eli Lilly and Company, because of \"the damage we had caused to their killer drug Prozac\". When Koppel asked Miscavige if he had affidavits or evidence to this effect, Miscavige responded \"You think they'd admit it?\" Miscavige stated that \"Eli Lilly ordered a reprint of 750,000 copies of \"Time\" magazine before it came out\", and that his attempts to investigate the matter with Eli Lilly and associated advertising companies were not successful.\n\nThe Church brought a libel lawsuit against Time Warner and Behar, seeking damages of $416 million. The Church alleged false and defamatory statements were made concerning the Church of Scientology International in the \"Time\" article. More specifically, the Church of Scientology's court statements claimed that Behar had been refining an anti-Scientology focus since his 1986 article in \"Forbes\", which included gathering negative materials about Scientology, and \"never accepting anything a Scientologist said and uniformly ignoring anything positive he learned about the Church\". In its initial complaint filing, the Church quoted portions of the Behar article that it alleged were false and defamatory, including the quote from Cynthia Kisser, and Behar's own assertion that Scientology was a \"global racket\" that intimidated individuals in a \"Mafia-like manner\".\nNoah Lottick's parents submitted affidavits in the case, in which they \"affirmed the accuracy of each statement in the article\"; Edward Lottick \"concluded that Scientology therapies were manipulations, and that no Scientology staff members attended the funeral\" of their son. During the litigation, the Church of Scientology attempted to subpoena Behar in a separate ongoing lawsuit with the Internal Revenue Service, and accused a federal magistrate of leaking information to him. Behar was questioned for over 190 hours during 30 days of depositions with Scientology attorneys in the libel case. One question was about Behar's life in his parents' home while he was still inside the womb. \"St. Petersburg Times\" explained that this question was prompted by Scientology teachings that certain problems come from prenatal memories. Behar told the \"St. Petersburg Times\" he \"felt it was extremely excessive\". In a countersuit, Behar brought up the issues of Church of Scientology private investigators and what he viewed as harassment. By July 1996, all counts of the libel suit had been dismissed. In the course of the litigation through 1996, Time Warner had spent $7.3 million in legal defense costs. The Church of Scientology also sued several individuals quoted in the \"Time\" article.\n\nThe Church of Scientology sued \"Reader's Digest\" in Switzerland, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Germany for publishing a condensed version of the \"Time\" story. The only court to provide a temporary injunction was in Lausanne, Switzerland. In France, Italy, and the Netherlands, the courts either dismissed the Church of Scientology's motions, or set injunction hearings far beyond the date of actual publication. The company defied the injunction and mailed copies of the article, \"Scientology: A Dangerous Cult Goes Mainstream\", to their . Worldwide editor-in-chief of \"Reader's Digest\", Kenneth Tomlinson, told \"The New York Times\" that \"a publisher cannot accept a court prohibiting distribution of a serious journalistic piece. ... The court order violates freedom of speech and freedom of the press\". The Church of Scientology subsequently filed a criminal complaint against the \"Digest\" in Lausanne, and Mike Rinder stated it was in blatant violation of the law. By defying the Swiss court ban, the \"Reader's Digest\" risked a fine of about $3,400, as well as a potential three months' jail time for the Swiss \"Digest\" editor-in-chief. A hearing on the injunction was set for November 11, 1991, and the injunction was later lifted by the Swiss court.\nIn January 2001, a United States federal appeals court upheld the dismissal of the Church of Scientology International's case against Time Warner. In its opinion, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that Time Warner had not published \"The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power\" with an actual intent of malice, a standard that must be met for libel cases involving individuals and public groups. On October 1, 2001, the Supreme Court of the United States refused to consider reinstating the church's libel case \"Church of Scientology International v. Time Warner Inc.\", 00-1683. Time Warner said it refused to be \"intimidated by the church's apparently limitless legal resources.\" In arguments presented to the Supreme Court, the Church of Scientology acknowledged that church officials had \"committed improper acts\" in the past, but also claimed that: \"allegations of past misconduct were false and distorted, the result of the misunderstanding, suspicion and prejudice that typically greet a new religion\". Of the rulings for Time Warner, the Church of Scientology complained that they \"provide a safe harbor for biased journalism\". Behar commented on the Church of Scientology's legal defeat, and said that the lawsuit had a chilling effect: \"It's a tremendous defeat for Scientology ... But of course their doctrine states that the purpose of a suit is to harass, not to win, so from that perspective they hurt us all. They've had a real chilling effect on journalism, both before and after my piece\".\n\nAs a result of writing the piece, Behar was presented with the 1992 Gerald Loeb Award for distinguished business and financial journalism, the Worth Bingham Prize, the Conscience-in-Media Award from the American Society of Journalists and Authors, awarded to \"those who have demonstrated singular commitment to the highest principles of journalism at notable personal cost or sacrifice,\" and the Cult Awareness Network's Leo J. Ryan Award, in honor of Congressman Leo J. Ryan. Paulette Cooper was also awarded the 1992 Conscience-in-Media Award by the American Society of Journalists and Authors, for her book \"The Scandal of Scientology\". This was the only time in the history of the American Society of Journalists and Authors that the award was presented to more than one journalist in the same year.\n\nIn a February 1992 issue of \"Time\", editor Elizabeth Valk congratulated Behar on his Conscience-in-Media Award, stating \"Needless to say, we are delighted and proud\". Valk noted that the honor had only been awarded seven times in the previous seventeen years of its existence. Managing editor Henry Muller also congratulated Behar in an April 1992 issue of \"Time\".\n\nSeveral authors have commented on the article and used it as a reference for background on Scientology. Not all analysis of the article has been positive. David Healy's book criticizing the pharmaceutical industry, \"Let Them Eat Prozac\", was critical: \"The \"Time\" article was way over the top. Even Saddam Hussein was portrayed less badly.\" Healy addressed the article's claim that lawsuits were one of the Church's key tactics against enemies. He noted that the Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR), a Church of Scientology affiliated group discussed in the article, had filed a petition with the Food and Drug Administration inquiring what it was going to do about Prozac. Healy dismissed the notion that CCHR engaged in \"orchestrated campaigns\", writing that very few of the 50 lawsuits filed against Prozac were related to the Church of Scientology. Mark Silk criticized Behar's article in his book \"Unsecular Media: Making News of Religion in America\". Silk classified the work among what he referred to as the \"false-prophecy topos\", and characterized Behar's account of Noah Lottick's suicide as an \"atrocity tale\".\n\n\"Insane Therapy\" noted that Scientology \"achieved more notoriety ... with the publication of the journalist Richard Behar's highly critical article\". \"Larson's Book of World Religions and Alternative Spirituality\" described the cover design of the article as it appeared in \"Time\", writing that it \"shouted\" the headline from the magazine cover. In a 2005 piece, \"Salon.com\" magazine noted that for those interested in the Church of Scientology, the \"Time\" article still remains a \"milestone in news coverage\", and that those who back the Church believe it was \"an outrageously biased account\".\n\nThe Church of Scientology's use of private investigators was cited in a 1998 article in the \"Boston Herald\", and compared to Behar's experiences when researching \"The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power\". After the paper ran a five-part series of critical articles in 1998, Church of Scientology President Heber Jentzsch confirmed that a private investigative firm was hired to look into the personal life of Joseph Mallia, the reporter who wrote the articles. In a later piece titled \"Church of Scientology probes Herald reporter—Investigation follows pattern of harassment\" this investigation was likened to Behar's assertions of harassment, as well as other reporters' experiences from 1974, 1988, and 1997.\n\nBecause of the history of conflict between \"Reader's Digest\" and Scientology, the writer of a 2005 cover story on Tom Cruise agreed to certain demands, including giving Scientology issues equal play in the writer's profile of Cruise, submitting questions for Cruise to Church of Scientology handlers, and sending the writer of the article to a one-day Church immersion course. Also in 2005, an article in \"Salon\" questioned whether the tactics of the Church's litigation and private investigations of Time Warner and other media sources had succeeded in decreasing the amount of investigative journalism pieces on Scientology in the press. A 2005 article in \"The Sunday Times\" cited the article, and came to the determination that the Church of Scientology's lawsuit against Time Warner \"served to warn off other potential investigations\", and that \"The chill evidently lingers still\".\n\n\"The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power\" continues to be used today by journalists in the media, as a reference for historical information on the Church of Scientology. In April 2007, CNN anchor Anderson Cooper interviewed former Office of Special Affairs director Mike Rinder, in a live piece on \"Anderson Cooper 360°\" titled \"Inside Scientology\". The CNN story was prompted by the May 2007 airing of a BBC \"Panorama\" investigative program, \"Scientology and Me\". In the interview, Anderson Cooper quoted directly from \"The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power\" article, when asking Rinder about the history of Operation Snow White, and if those tactics were currently used by the Church. Rinder answered by stating that the individuals involved with Operation Snow White were no longer involved in Church of Scientology activities, and that the incident was \"ancient history\". Cooper then again referenced the \"Time\" magazine article noting that Behar asserted that he was illegally investigated by Scientology contacts during research for his article. Cooper questioned Rinder on the dismissed lawsuit against Time Warner, and Rinder acknowledged that all of the Church of Scientology's appeals against Time Warner were eventually rejected.\n\nThe article has been cited as a reference used for background on Scientology in books which take a critical look at cults such as \"Larson's Book of World Religions and Alternative Spirituality\" and \"Insane Therapy: Portrait of a Psychotherapy Cult\", those that analyze new religious movements including \"Understanding New Religious Movements\" and \"The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements\", and in a work that includes researchers from both schools of thought, \"Misunderstanding Cults: Searching for Objectivity in a Controversial Field\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1548928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1548928", "title": "Truth in Lending Act", "text": "Truth in Lending Act\n\nThe Truth in Lending Act (TILA) of 1968 is a United States federal law designed to promote the informed use of consumer credit, by requiring disclosures about its terms and cost to standardize the manner in which costs associated with borrowing are calculated and disclosed.\n\nTILA also gives consumers the right to cancel certain credit transactions that involve a lien on a consumer's principal dwelling, regulates certain credit card practices, and provides a means for fair and timely resolution of credit billing disputes. With the exception of certain high-cost mortgage loans, TILA does not regulate the charges that may be imposed for consumer credit. Rather, it requires uniform or standardized disclosure of costs and charges so that consumers can shop. It also imposes limitations on home equity plans that are subject to the requirements of and certain \"higher-priced\" mortgage loans (HPMLs) that are subject to the requirements of . The regulation prohibits certain acts or practices in connection with credit secured by a consumer's principal dwelling.\n\nThe Truth in Lending Act was originally Title I of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, . The regulations implementing the statute, which are known as \"Regulation Z\", are codified at . Most of the specific requirements imposed by TILA are found in Regulation Z, so a reference to the requirements of TILA usually refers to the requirements contained in Regulation Z, as well as the statute itself.\n\nFrom TILA's inception, the authority to implement the statute by issuing regulations was given to the Federal Reserve Board (FRB). However, effective July 21, 2011, TILA's general rule making authority was transferred to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), whose authority was established pursuant to provisions enacted by the passage of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in July 2010. Any forthcoming regulations implementing the statute, which are also formally referred to as Regulation Z, will be codified at and attempt to mirror the FRB's Regulation Z whenever feasible. The Federal Reserve will retain some limited rule making authority under TILA for loans made by certain motor vehicle dealers, and for certain other provisions.\n\nThe TILA introduced the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) calculation mandated for all consumer lenders. Certain misleading interest rate calculations used previously, mainly on auto loans, were barred. For more than a decade, consumer loans were reported by APR in an economically meaningful way. Then in the 1980s the auto manufacturers began to exploit a loophole in TILA and its administration. Neither the Act nor its administrators adequately differentiated between \"amount financed\" and \"finance charges,\" two terms that appear on the TILA required disclosure statements. By \"bundling\" the price of the car and its financing charges (which come from the auto maker's captive finance company), auto makers were able to shift money between the two categories, even to eliminating the financing charge entirely. Thus \"zero percent APR\" financing was born.\n\nTypical offers from auto companies are \"Zero Percent APR financing available or $1,000 rebate.\" The consumer who elects \"zero percent\" financing gives up a $1,000 rebate (reduction in car price). Effectively, he or she pays $1,000 to get the \"interest free\" loan. Since only auto makers can do this type of bundling, banks, credit unions and other competitors are left at a disadvantage. They must disclose true APR rates while the auto makers can claim no interest costs. In the process, the typical consumer is left with a complex finance problem. \"Zero percent\" financing can cost a lot less, or a lot more than conventional financing with a non-auto maker institution.\n\nThe regulation is divided into subparts.\n\nSubpart B relates to open-end credit lines (revolving credit accounts), which includes credit card accounts and home-equity lines of credit (HELOCs).\n\nSubpart C relates to closed-end credit, such as home-purchase loans and motor vehicle loans with a fixed loan term. It contains rules on disclosures, treatment of credit balances, annual percentage rate calculations, right of rescission,non requirements, and advertising.\n\nSubpart D contains rules on oral disclosures, Spanish language disclosure in Puerto Rico, record retention, effect on state laws, state exemptions (which only apply to states that had Truth in Lending-type laws prior to the Federal Act), and rate limitations.\n\nSubpart E contains special rules for mortgage transactions.\n\nSeveral appendices contain information such as the procedures for determinations about state laws, state exemptions and issuance of staff interpretations, special rules for certain kinds of credit plans, a list of enforcement agencies, model disclosures which if used properly will ensure compliance with the Act, and the rules for computing annual percentage rates in closed-end credit transactions and total annual loan cost rates for reverse mortgage transactions.\n\nFor certain transactions secured by a borrower's principle dwelling, TILA requires that the borrower be granted three business days following loan consummation to rescind the transaction. The right of rescission allows borrowers time to reexamine the credit agreement and cost disclosures, as well as to reconsider whether they want to place their homes at risk by offering it as security for the credit. Each borrower and any person who has a vested interest in the property may exercise the right to rescind until midnight of the third business day following consummation, or delivery of all material disclosures, whichever occurs last. If the required rescission notice or material TILA disclosures are inaccurate or not delivered, the borrowers right to rescind may be extended from three days after consummation to up to three years.\n\nWhen a borrower rescinds, the security interest becomes void and the borrower is not liable for any amount, including finance charges.

It was made on 23 September 1989.\n\nIt made it clear that the text of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) reflected customary international law, and every ship, regardless of cargo, does not need permission to enter another state's territorial sea so long as it adheres to the definition of innocent passage in Article 19 of UNCLOS.\n"}
{"id": "20585666", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20585666", "title": "Virgin Killer", "text": "Virgin Killer\n\nVirgin Killer is the fourth studio album by German rock band Scorpions. It was released in 1976 and was the band's first album to attract attention outside Europe. The title is described as being a reference to time as the killer of innocence. The original cover featured a nude prepubescent girl, which stirred controversy in the UK, US and elsewhere. As a result, the album was re-issued with a different cover in some countries.\n\nIn December 2008, the image again gave rise to controversy when the British Internet Watch Foundation placed certain pages from Wikipedia on its internet blacklist, since it considered the image to be \"potentially illegal\" under the Protection of Children Act 1978. This resulted in much of the UK being prevented from editing Wikipedia, and significant public debate on the decision. The decision was reversed by the IWF after four days of blocking.\n\nThe success of \"Virgin Killer\" was similar to other Scorpions albums featuring Uli Jon Roth as lead guitarist; it \"failed to attain any serious attention in the United States\" but was \"quite popular in Japan\" where it peaked at number 32 in the charts. The album was another step in the band's shift from psychedelic music to hard rock. Critic Vincent Jeffries of AllMusic contends in hindsight that the album was \"the first of four studio releases that really defined the Scorpions and their urgent metallic sound that was to become highly influential\". He also counts the title track and \"Pictured Life\" among the \"all-time Scorpions standouts\". Among the band members, Uli Jon Roth considers \"Virgin Killer\" and the previous release \"In Trance\" as his favourite Scorpions albums.\n\nThe original cover art for the album depicted a nude ten-year-old girl, with a shattered glass effect obscuring her genitalia. The image was designed by Steffan Böhle, who was then the product manager for the West German branch of RCA Records. Francis Buchholz was the bassist for the band and, in an interview conducted in early 2007, recollects that the model depicted on the cover was either the daughter or the niece of the cover designer. The photograph was taken by Michael von Gimbut. The band's rhythm guitarist Rudolf Schenker offers the following description of the circumstances behind the album cover:\n\nWe didn't actually have the idea. It was the record company. The record company guys were like, \"Even if we have to go to jail, there's no question that we'll release that.\" On the song \"Virgin Killer\", time is the virgin killer. But then, when we had to do the interviews about it, we said \"Look, listen to the lyrics and then you'll know what we're talking about. We're using this only to get attention. That's what we do.\" Even the girl, when we met her fifteen years later, had no problem with the cover. Growing up in Europe, sexuality, of course not with children, was very normal. The lyrics really say it all. Time is the virgin killer. A kid comes into the world very naive, they lose that naiveness and then go into this life losing all of this getting into trouble. That was the basic idea about all of it.\n\nIn a separate interview, Schenker also notes that he thought the cover art was a \"great thing\" and that he had \"pushed the band to really stay behind it\" as he felt that people would \"think differently\" when they looked at the lyrics and realized that the cover art was only being used as \"a symbol of the lyrics\". In a 2008 interview, Schenker added \"We would never again do something like this\". The band's former lead guitarist Uli Jon Roth notes that the cover art of the \"old Scorpion albums\" were \"usually done by other people\". He has since expressed regret over the original album cover:\n\nLooking at that picture today makes me cringe. It was done in the worst possible taste. Back then I was too immature to see that. Shame on me—I should have done everything in my power to stop it. The record company came up with the idea, I think. The lyrics incidentally were a take-off on Kiss, whom we had just supported on a tour. I was fooling around and played the riff of the song in the rehearsal room and spontaneously improvised 'cause he's a virgin killer!' trying to do a more or less way-off-the-mark Paul Stanley impersonation. Klaus immediately said 'that's great! You should do something with it.' Then I had the unenviable task of constructing a meaningful set of lyrics around the title, which I actually managed to do to some degree. But the song has a totally different meaning from what people would assume at first. Virgin Killer is none other than the demon of our time, the less compassionate side of the societies we live in today—brutally trampling upon the heart and soul of innocence.\n\nIn 2008, photographer Michael von Gimbut emphasized that his wife, the model's mother and sister, and three female assistants had been present during the shooting and stated, \"Back then, we loved and protected children and did not sleep with them.\"\n\nThe cover generated controversy: the album could only be sold sealed in black plastic in several countries and the cover was replaced in some countries with an alternative cover art depicting the band members. The original is named in various \"worst album cover\" lists: \"Cracked\" magazine online named it the No. 1 \"Worst Album Cover of All-Time\", while Gigwise.com lists it as No. 1 on its March 2008 \"The 50 Most Controversial Album Covers of All Time!\" list. Similarly, it was named by UGO Networks one of the \"Weirdest Album Covers\" and placed No. 6 on the \"All-Time Worst Album Covers\" list made by \"two.one.five\" magazine.\n\nThis would not be the last time that the band attracted controversy with its album covers. Their next album, \"Taken by Force\", originally featured cover art that depicted \"children playing with guns at a military cemetery in France and some people found that offensive\". Their 1979 album \"Lovedrive\" featured a \"bizarre artwork\" that depicts \"a woman on the back seat of a car with bubblegum over her breast\". Both covers were replaced by an alternative design. Vocalist Klaus Meine explains that the band's penchant for controversial cover art stems from a desire \"to go over the edge\" and not \"to offend some people or make the headlines [as] that would be stupid\", contrasting guitarist Rudolf Schenker's earlier statement, \"We're using this only to get attention.\" In a 2010 interview Meine commented on the cover art again stating:\n\nBack in those days [the 1970s] it was RCA, our record label then, went over the edge with Virgin Killer. Today when you think of child pornography on the net, you would never do something like that. We never did this in the sense of pornography, we did it in the sense of art. It is about the song and the label was pushing the idea because they wanted to get the controversy to help the album sale and you cannot get better promotion than that. Looking back from the band point of view it was never an album cover that we took home to our parents and said, \"Look what we just released..\" There was always mixed feelings about it and even 30 years later it caused a scandal at Wikipedia because the site for that album was blocked and even the FBI was getting involved. All of that after so many years, can you believe that?\n\nIn August 2015, a court in Sweden said that it considered the album cover to be child pornography.\n\nIn May 2008, the US-based social conservative site \"WorldNetDaily\" reported the cover image on Wikipedia to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. A subsequent investigation by the FBI concluded that the artwork did not violate any US laws. \"EContent\" magazine subsequently reported the Wikipedia community's internal debate as concluding that: \"Prior discussion has determined by broad consensus that the \"Virgin Killer\" cover will not be removed\" and asserted that Wikipedia contributors \"favour inclusion in all but the most extreme cases\".\n\nIn December 2008, the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), a UK-based non-government organization, added the Wikipedia article \"Virgin Killer\" to its internet blacklist due to concerns over legality of the image, which had been assessed as the lowest level of legal concern: \"erotic posing with no sexual activity\". As a result, people using many major UK ISPs were blocked from viewing the entire article by the Cleanfeed system, and a large part of the UK was blocked from editing Wikipedia owing to the means of blocking in use. Following representations by the Wikimedia Foundation (who host the Wikipedia website) and public complaints, the IWF reversed their decision three days later and confirmed that in future they would not block copies of the image that were hosted overseas. The IWF stated that one of the reasons for reversing their decision was that it had increased public interest in the image, an example of the Streisand effect.\n\nScorpions\n\nAdditional musicians\n\nProduction\n\n\n"}

Three other members of her immediate family were also killed in the same attack.\n\nBitiyeva's was not an isolated case and many people in Chechnya who have submitted cases of serious human rights violations to the ECHR have been also subjected to reprisals, including being killed or forcibly disappeared.\n\nBitiyeva was born in 1948 in Kazakhstan during the forced exile of the entire Chechen nation. Later she returned to Chechnya, settling in the village of Kalinovskaya (Kalinovskaia). During the First Chechen War, she was actively involved in anti-war protests. In February 2000, during the Second Chechen War, she and her son Idris were arbitrarily detained by the Russian forces and taken to the unofficial detention centre known as Chernokozovo, a \"filtration camp\" infamous of torture, rape and other abuses. When she has arrived at Chernokozovo, the guards told her she would \"never leave alive.\" Bitiyeva, who tried to defend other prisoners, went on hunger strike and was released in a very ill condition. Her friends helped her go to Turkey, but once her health was slightly better, she went back to Chechnya and began collecting evidence of crimes committed against civilian population of the republic, submitting it to United Nations and international human rights organizations. In February 2003, Bitiyeva had been part of the group of women that demanded the opening of a mass grave site discovered near the settlement of Kapustino. She also worked with the Russian NGO Committee of Soldiers' Mothers.\n\nOn May 21, 2003, in the middle of a night, a group of over ten unidentified Russian-speaking special forces troops (four of them masked) arrived in Kalinovskaya in two UAZ-452 minivans. The troops broke into her family house and bound, gagged and hooded Zura and her son Idris, as well as her husband Ramzan and her brother Abubakar, and then shot all four of them in the back of their heads (Zura was shot also in her hands). Only her other son, Eldard, escaped death by hiding just in time. The killers also stole a videocassette recorder from the house. Later in the morning, two local men (Turpal Ismailov and Islambek Gadiyev) were also killed in their homes, presumably by the same group of attackers.\n\nBitiyeva had filed a complaint against Moscow with the European Court of Human Rights in 2000 for abuse while in detention (this was then-second ECHR case from Chechnya), but she was murdered before the ruling was issued. On June 21, 2007, in the case of Bitiyeva and X v. Russia, the Court ruled that Russian forces were responsible for Bitiyeva's illegal detention, the inhuman and degrading treatment she suffered during detention, and for her subsequent \"brutal\" death. Russia was ordered by the court to pay €85,000 in damages to Bitiyeva's daughter, living as a refugee in Germany.\n\n"}
