The techniques and theories, generally speaking, work with most or all sensor types including optical, acoustic, laser scanning, radar, thermal, seismic.\n\nAcquisition can occur from a multitude of methods including 2D images, acquired sensor data and on site sensors.\n\n3D data acquisition and object reconstruction can be performed using stereo image pairs. Stereo photogrammetry or photogrammetry based on a block of overlapped images is the primary approach for 3D mapping and object reconstruction using 2D images. Close-range photogrammetry has also matured to the level where cameras or digital cameras can be used to capture the close-look images of objects, e.g., buildings, and reconstruct them using the very same theory as the aerial photogrammetry. An example of software which could do this is Vexcel FotoG 5. This software has now been replaced by Vexcel GeoSynth. Another similar software program is Microsoft Photosynth.\n\nA semi-automatic method for acquiring 3D topologically structured data from 2D aerial stereo images has been presented by Sisi Zlatanova. The process involves the manual digitizing of a number of points necessary for automatically reconstructing the 3D objects. Each reconstructed object is validated by superimposition of its wire frame graphics in the stereo model. The topologically structured 3D data is stored in a database and are also used for visualization of the objects. Software used for 3D data acquisition using 2D images include e.g. Agisoft Photoscan, RealityCapture, Autodesk 123D Catch, ENSAIS Engineering College TIPHON (Traitement d'Image et PHOtogrammétrie Numérique). CyberCity 3D Modeler, 3D UNDERWORLD SLS.\n\nA method for semi-automatic building extraction together with a concept for storing building models alongside terrain and other topographic data in a topographical information system has been developed by Franz Rottensteiner. His approach was based on the integration of building parameter estimations into the photogrammetry process applying a hybrid modeling scheme. Buildings are decomposed into a set of simple primitives that are reconstructed individually and are then combined by Boolean operators. The internal data structure of both the primitives and the compound building models are based on the boundary representation methods\n\nMultiple images are used in Zeng's approach to surface reconstruction from multiple images. A central idea is to explore the integration of both 3D stereo data and 2D calibrated images. This approach is motivated by the fact that only robust and accurate feature points that survived the geometry scrutiny of multiple images are reconstructed in space. The density insufficiency and the inevitable holes in the stereo data should then be filled in by using information from multiple images. The idea is thus to first construct small surface patches from stereo points, then to progressively propagate only reliable patches in their neighborhood from images into the whole surface using a best-first strategy. The problem thus reduces to searching for an optimal local surface patch going through a given set of stereo points from images.\n\nMulti-spectral images are also used for 3D building detection. The first and last pulse data and the normalized difference vegetation index are used in the process.\n\nNew measurement techniques are also employed to obtain measurements of and between objects from single images by using the projection, or the shadow as well as their combination. This technology is gaining attention given its fast processing time, and far lower cost than stereo measurements. GeoTango SilverEye technology is the first of this kind commercial product that can produce very realistic city models and buildings from single satellite and aerial images.\n\nSemi-Automatic building extraction from LIDAR Data and High-Resolution Images is also a possibility. Again, this approach allows modelling without physically moving towards the location or object. From airborne LIDAR data, digital surface model (DSM) can be generated and then the objects higher than the ground are automatically detected from the DSM. Based on general knowledge about buildings, geometric characteristics such as size, height and shape information are then used to separate the buildings from other objects. The extracted building outlines are then simplified using an orthogonal algorithm to obtain better cartographic quality. Watershed analysis can be conducted to extract the ridgelines of building roofs. The ridgelines as well as slope information are used to classify the buildings per type. The buildings are then reconstructed using three parametric building models (flat, gabled, hipped).\n\nLIDAR and other terrestrial laser scanning technology offers the fastest, automated way to collect height or distance information. LIDAR or laser for height measurement of buildings is becoming very promising. Commercial applications of both airborne LIDAR and ground laser scanning technology have proven to be fast and accurate methods for building height extraction. The building extraction task is needed to determine building locations, ground elevation, orientations, building size, rooftop heights, etc. Most buildings are described to sufficient details in terms of general polyhedra, i.e., their boundaries can be represented by a set of planar surfaces and straight lines. Further processing such as expressing building footprints as polygons is used for data storing in GIS databases.\n\nUsing laser scans and images taken from ground level and a bird's-eye perspective, Fruh and Zakhor present an approach to automatically create textured 3D city models. This approach involves registering and merging the detailed facade models with a complementary airborne model. The airborne modeling process generates a half-meter resolution model with a bird's-eye view of the entire area, containing terrain profile and building tops. Ground-based modeling process results in a detailed model of the building facades. Using the DSM obtained from airborne laser scans, they localize the acquisition vehicle and register the ground-based facades to the airborne model by means of Monte Carlo localization (MCL). Finally, the two models are merged with different resolutions to obtain a 3D model.\n\nUsing an airborne laser altimeter, Haala, Brenner and Anders combined height data with the existing ground plans of buildings. The ground plans of buildings had already been acquired either in analog form by maps and plans or digitally in a 2D GIS. The project was done in order to enable an automatic data capture by the integration of these different types of information. Afterwards virtual reality city models are generated in the project by texture processing, e.g. by mapping of terrestrial images. The project demonstrated the feasibility of rapid acquisition of 3D urban GIS. Ground plans proved are another very important source of information for 3D building reconstruction. Compared to results of automatic procedures, these ground plans proved more reliable since they contain aggregated information which has been made explicit by human interpretation. For this reason, ground plans, can considerably reduce costs in a reconstruction project. An example of existing ground plan data usable in building reconstruction is the Digital Cadastral map, which provides information on the distribution of property, including the borders of all agricultural areas and the ground plans of existing buildings. Additionally information as street names and the usage of buildings (e.g. garage, residential building, office block, industrial building, church) is provided in the form of text symbols. At the moment the Digital Cadastral map is built up as a data base covering an area, mainly composed by digitizing preexisting maps or plans.\n\nSoftware used for airborne laser scanning includes OPALS (Orientation and Processing of Airborne Laser Scanning data), ...\n\n\nAfter the data has been collected, the acquired (and sometimes already processed) data from images or sensors needs to be reconstructed. This may be done in the same program or in some cases, the 3D data needs to be exported and imported into another program for further refining, and/or to add additional data. Such additional data could be gps-location data, ... Also, after the reconstruction, the data might be directly implemented into a local (GIS) map or a worldwide map such as Google Earth.\n\nSeveral software packets are used in which the acquired (and sometimes already processed) data from images or sensors is imported. The software packets include (in alphabetical order):\n\n"}

The crossing of the River Stour was probably the swine-ford that gave rise to the placenames Kingswinford and Oldswinford, and later to the name Stourbridge.\n\nThe road from Wordsley Green to the Market House in Stourbidge and so to Bromsgrove was turnpiked in 1753. The same act also dealt with several other roads from that Market House, as well as the road from Birmingham through Halesowen and Hagley to Blakedown Pool, but that was managed by separate trustees from 1773. Its continuation north of Wordsley Green, through Wolverhampton, and Stafford to Stone, much of it now part of A449 road was turnpiked by the Wolverhampton Turnpike Act of 1760.\n\nIn the original 1922 road numberings, A491 was assigned to the Shrewsbury, Welshpool, Mallwyd and Cemmaes Road route, now part of the A458 and A470. The route between Wall Heath and Bromsgrove was assigned the A449 number.\n\nStarting at junction 4 of the M5, the road heads West on a single carriageway alignment, meeting the B4091 at a roundabout, then becoming a dual carriageway. There are local accesses for the villages of Belbroughton, Clent, Romsley and Holy Cross. Following a roundabout in Hagley the A491 is concurrent with the A456 for a short period before heading north towards Stourbridge. At Pedmore the A4036 leaves at a roundabout towards Dudley. The A491 then continues to join the Stourbridge ring road.\n\nThe A491 resumes again on the northern side of the Stourbridge ring road. This final section is entirely single carriageway in an urban environment. The road passes through Amblecote, Wordsley and Kingswinford, passing numerous traffic light controlled junctions, before terminating on the A449 at a roundabout just north of Wall Heath.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "626035", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=626035", "title": "Bed load", "text": "Bed load\n\nThe term bed load or bedload describes particles in a flowing fluid (usually water) that are transported along the bed. Bed load is complementary to suspended load and wash load.\n\nBed load moves by rolling, sliding, and/or saltating (hopping).\n\nGenerally, bed load downstream will be smaller and more rounded than bed load upstream (a process known as downstream fining). This is due in part to attrition and abrasion which results from the stones colliding with each other and against the river channel, thus removing the rough texture (rounding) and reducing the size of the particles. However, selective transport of sediments also plays a role in relation to downstream fining: smaller-than average particles are more easily entrained than larger-than average particles, since the shear stress required to entrain a grain is linearly proportional to the diameter of the grain. However, the degree of size selectivity is restricted by the hiding effect described by Parker and Klingeman (1982), wherein larger particles protrude from the bed whereas small particles are shielded and hidden by larger particles, with the result that nearly all grain sizes become entrained at nearly the same shear stress.\n\nExperimental observations suggest that a uniform free-surface flow over a cohesion less plane bed is unable to entrain sediments below a critical value formula_1 of the ratio between measures of hydrodynamic(destabilizing) and gravitational(stabilizing)\nforces acting on sediment particles, the so-called Shields stress formula_2. This quantity reads as:\nwhere formula_4 is the friction velocity, s is the relative particle density, d is an effective particle diameter which is entrained by the flow, and g is gravity. Meyer-Peter-Müller formula for the bed load capacity under equilibrium and uniform flow conditions states that the magnitude of the bed load flux formula_5 for unit width is proportional to the excess of shear stress with respect to a critical one formula_6. Specifically, formula_5 is a monotonically increasing nonlinear function of the excess Shields stress formula_8, typically expressed in the form of a power law. .\n"}

English also Campeachy, is a city in Campeche Municipality in the state of Campeche, Mexico—located at , on the shore of the Bay of Campeche of the Gulf of Mexico—and its municipal seat also serves as the state's capital city. The city's population at the 2010 census was 220,389, and the municipality for which it serves as municipal seat had a population of 259,005.\n\nThe city was founded in 1540 by Spanish conquistadores as San Francisco de Campeche atop the pre-existing Maya city of Can Pech. The Pre-Columbian city was described as having 3,000 houses and various monuments, of which little trace remains. \n\nThe city retains many of the old colonial Spanish city walls and fortifications which protected the city (not always successfully) from pirates and buccaneers. The state of preservation and quality of its architecture earned it the status of a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1999. Originally, the Spaniards lived inside the walled city, while the natives lived in the surrounding \"barrios\" of San Francisco, Guadalupe and San Román. These barrios still retain their original churches; the one in Guadalupe is almost 500 years old.\n\nFounded in 1540 by Francisco Montejo, Campeche was terrorized by pirates and marauders until the city started fortification in 1686.\n\nSan Francisco de Campeche was originally an indigenous village, Ah Kim Pech, where the Spanish first landed in Mexico in 1517. The city of Campeche was founded in 1540 and fortified against pirates during the 17th century. It still has the appearance of a fortress. Historical monuments and buildings, such as the Franciscan cathedral, old Maya ruins, and the old city walls and forts, attract many tourists. \n\nThe fortifications system of Campeche, an eminent example of the military architecture of the 17th and 18th centuries, is part of an overall defensive system set up by the Spanish to protect the ports on the Caribbean Sea from pirate attacks like the 1663 Sack of Campeche.\n\nThe state of preservation and quality of its architecture earned it the status of a World Heritage Site in 1999.\n\nThe city of Campeche is an example of urbanism in a baroque colonial city, with a reticular and regular plan, its urban trace, a model of colonial port cities, reflects the main role that it played as a commercial, religious and military connection point characterized by its high level of integrity and homogeneity. More than one thousand buildings with a historic value have survived as witnesses of space and temporal superimposition of several significant historic periods of Mexico.\n\nDue to the constant attacks of both English and Dutch buccaneers and pirates such as Francis Drake, John Hawkins, Laurens de Graaf, Cornelis Jol, Jacobo Jackson, Jean Lafitte, Francisco de Grammont, Bartolomé Portugués, William Parker, Francisco Nau, Edward Mansvelt, Henry Morgan, Lewis Scot, Roche Braziliano and Michel de Grammont for almost 160 years, in 1686 the government started to fortify the city. \n\nThe French engineer Louis Bouchard de Becour was commissioned to unify all the defensive works that surrounded the city with a wall. At its completion, the wall surrounding the city of Campeche was 2,560 meters in length, forming an irregular hexagon around the main part of the city, with eight defensive bastions on the corners. These bulwarks now serve different functions:\n\n\nIt also contained four gates to allow access to the main quarters. The main entrances are the \"Puerta de la tierra\" (\"Land Gate\"), built in 1732, and the \"Puerta del mar\" (\"Sea Gate\"). The Land Gate is kept as a tourist attraction, having a light and sound show three nights each week and keeping original supplies and items from the 17th century. The other gates were Guadalupe and San Román, connecting to the outside neighborhoods.\n\nAdditionally, two main forts protected the city from two nearby hills on each side, the forts of San José el Alto (built in 1762) and San Miguel. These forts gave long-range artillery coverage and served also as look-outs. They were built before the walls of the city. The fort of San Miguel is used as a museum and houses a collection of pre-Hispanic items. The fort of San José houses a collection of boats and weapons of the period.\n\nAs of 2010, the municipality had a total population of 259,005.\n\nThe municipal seat, and largest settlement, is the city of San Francisco de Campeche (often shortened to Campeche). As of 2010, the city had a population of 220,389.\n\nAside from the municipal seat, the municipality has 564 localities. \n\nThe largest localities are, (with 2010 populations in parentheses): Lerma (8,281), Chiná (5,194), classified as urban, and Los Laureles (2,251), Alfredo V. Bonfil (2,060), Pich (1,756), Tikinmul (1,663), Imí (1,227), Hampolol (1,123), Castamay (1,101), and San Francisco Kobén (1,045), classified as rural.\n\nCampeche has a tropical savanna climate, with most rain falling in the wet season from June to October.\n\n\n"}

Wilson, is an American biologist, theorist, naturalist and author. His biological specialty is myrmecology, the study of ants, on which he has been called the world's leading expert.\n\nWilson has been called \"the father of sociobiology\" and \"the father of biodiversity\", his environmental advocacy, and his secular-humanist and deist ideas pertaining to religious and ethical matters. Among his greatest contributions to ecological theory is the theory of island biogeography, which he developed in collaboration with the mathematical ecologist Robert MacArthur, which was the foundation of the development of conservation area design, as well as the unified neutral theory of biodiversity of Stephen Hubbell.\n\nWilson was born in Birmingham, Alabama. According to his autobiography \"Naturalist\", he grew up mostly around Washington, D.C. and in the countryside around Mobile, Alabama. From an early age, he was interested in natural history. His parents, Edward and Inez Wilson, divorced when he was seven. The young naturalist grew up in several cities and towns, moving around with his father and his stepmother.\n\nIn the same year that his parents divorced, Wilson blinded himself in one eye in a fishing accident. He suffered for hours, but he continued fishing. He did not complain because he was anxious to stay outdoors. He did not seek medical treatment. Several months later, his right pupil clouded over with a cataract. He was admitted to Pensacola Hospital to have the lens removed. Wilson writes, in his autobiography, that the \"surgery was a terrifying [19th] century ordeal\". Wilson was left with full sight in his left eye, with a vision of 20/10. The 20/10 vision prompted him to focus on \"little things\": \"I noticed butterflies and ants more than other kids did, and took an interest in them automatically.\"\n\nAlthough he had lost his stereoscopic vision, he could still see fine print and the hairs on the bodies of small insects. His reduced ability to observe mammals and birds led him to concentrate on insects.\n\nAt nine, Wilson undertook his first expeditions at the Rock Creek Park in Washington, DC. He began to collect insects and he gained a passion for butterflies. He would capture them using nets made with brooms, coat hangers, and cheesecloth bags. Going on these expeditions led to Wilson's fascination with ants. He describes in his autobiography how one day he pulled the bark of a rotting tree away and discovered citronella ants underneath. The worker ants he found were \"short, fat, brilliant yellow, and emitted a strong lemony odor\". Wilson said the event left a \"vivid and lasting impression on [him]\". He also earned the Eagle Scout award and served as Nature Director of his Boy Scout summer camp. At the age of 18, intent on becoming an entomologist, he began by collecting flies, but the shortage of insect pins caused by World War II caused him to switch to ants, which could be stored in vials. With the encouragement of Marion R. Smith, a myrmecologist from the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, Wilson began a survey of all the ants of Alabama. This study led him to report the first colony of fire ants in the US, near the port of Mobile.\n\nConcerned that he might not be able to afford to go to a university, Wilson tried to enlist in the United States Army. He planned to earn U.S. government financial support for his education, but failed the Army medical examination due to his impaired eyesight. Wilson was able to afford to enroll in the University of Alabama after all, earning his B.S. and M.S. degrees in biology there in 1950. In 1952 he transferred to Harvard University.\nAppointed to the Harvard Society of Fellows, he could travel on overseas expeditions, collecting ant species of Cuba and Mexico and travel the South Pacific, including Australia, New Guinea, Fiji, New Caledonia and Sri Lanka. In 1955, he received his Ph.D. and married Irene Kelley.\n\nFrom 1956 until 1996 Wilson was part of the faculty of Harvard. \nHe began as an ant taxonomist and worked on understanding their evolution, how they developed into new species by escaping environmental disadvantages and moving into new habitats. He developed a theory of the \"taxon cycle\".\n\nJust after completing is PhD in 1955, Wilson started supervising Stuart A. Altmann on the social behavior of rhesus macaques, which gave Wilson a first impetus to imagine sociobiology as a global theory of animal social behavior.\n\nHe collaborated with mathematician William Bossert, and discovered the chemical nature of ant communication, via pheromones. In the 1960s he collaborated with mathematician and ecologist Robert MacArthur. Together, they tested the theory of species equilibrium on a tiny island in the Florida Keys. He eradicated all insect species and observed the re-population by new species. A book \"The Theory of Island Biogeography\" about this experiment became a standard ecology text.\n\nIn 1971, he published the book \"The Insect Societies\" about the biology of social insects like ants, bees, wasps and termites. In 1973, Wilson was appointed 'Curator of Insects' at the Museum of Comparative Zoology. In 1975, he published the book \"\" applying his theories of insect behavior to vertebrates, and in the last chapter, humans. He speculated that evolved and inherited tendencies were responsible for hierarchical social organisation among humans. In 1978 he published \"On Human Nature\", which dealt with the role of biology in the evolution of human culture and won a Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction.\n\nIn 1981 after collaborating with Charles Lumsden, he published \"Genes, Mind and Culture\", a theory of gene-culture coevolution. In 1990 he published \"The Ants\", co-written with Bert Hölldobler, his second Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction.\n\nIn the 1990s, he published \"The Diversity of Life\" (1992), an autobiography: \"Naturalist\" (1994), and \"Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge\" (1998) about the unity of the natural and social sciences.\n\nIn 1996, Wilson officially retired from Harvard University, where he continues to hold the positions of Professor Emeritus and Honorary Curator in Entomology. He founded the E.O. Wilson Biodiversity Foundation, which finances the PEN/E. O. Wilson Literary Science Writing Award and is an \"independent foundation\" at the Nicholas School of the Environment, Duke University. Wilson became a special lecturer at Duke University as part of the agreement.\n\nWilson has published 14 books during the new millennium: \"The Future of Life\", 2002, \n\"Pheidole in the New World: A Dominant, Hyperdiverse Ant Genus,\" 2003, \n\"From So Simple a Beginning: Darwin's Four Great Books,\" 2005, \n\"The Creation: An Appeal to Save Life on Earth,\" September 2006, \n\"Nature Revealed: Selected Writings\" 1949–2006, \n\"The Superorganism: The Beauty, Elegance, and Strangeness of Insect Societies,\" 2009,\n\"\" April 2010, \n\"Kingdom of Ants: Jose Celestino Mutis and the Dawn of Natural History in the New World\", 2010,\n\"The Leafcutter Ants: Civilization by Instinct,\" 2011, \n\"The Social Conquest of Earth\", 2012,\n\"Half-Earth: Our Planet's Fight for Life\", 2016.\n\nHe published 3 books in 2014 alone: \"Letters to a Young Scientist\", \n\"A Window on Eternity: A Biologist's Walk Through Gorongosa National Park,\" and\n\"The Meaning of Human Existence\".\n\nHe and his wife Irene reside in Lexington, Massachusetts. His daughter, Catherine, and her husband Jonathan, reside in nearby Stow, Massachusetts.\n\nWilson used sociobiology and evolutionary principles to explain the behavior of social insects and then to understand the social behavior of other animals, including humans, thus established sociobiology as a new scientific field. He argued that all animal behavior, including that of humans, is the product of heredity, environmental stimuli, and past experiences, and that free will is an illusion. He has referred to the biological basis of behaviour as the \"genetic leash\". The sociobiological view is that all animal social behavior is governed by epigenetic rules worked out by the laws of evolution. This theory and research proved to be seminal, controversial, and influential.\n\nWilson has argued that the unit of selection is a gene, the basic element of heredity. The \"target\" of selection is normally the individual who carries an ensemble of genes of certain kinds. With regard to the use of kin selection in explaining the behavior of eusocial insects, the \"new view that I'm proposing is that it was group selection all along, an idea first roughly formulated by Darwin.\"\n\nSociobiological research was at the time particularly controversial with regard to its application to humans. The theory established a scientific argument for rejecting the common doctrine of tabula rasa, which holds that human beings are born without any innate mental content and that culture functions to increase human knowledge and aid in survival and success. In the final chapter of the book \"Sociobiology\" Wilson argues that the human mind is shaped as much by genetic inheritance as it is by culture if not more. There are, Wilson suggests in the chapter, limits on just how much influence social and environmental factors can have in altering human behavior.\n\n\"Sociobiology\" was initially met with substantial criticism. Several of Wilson's colleagues at Harvard, such as Richard Lewontin and Stephen Jay Gould, were strongly opposed to his ideas regarding sociobiology. Gould, Lewontin, and others from the Sociobiology Study Group from the Boston area wrote \"Against 'Sociobiology'\" in an open letter criticizing Wilson's \"deterministic view of human society and human action\". Although attributed to members of the Sociobiology Study Group, it seems that Lewontin was the main author. In a 2011 interview, Wilson said, \"I believe Gould was a charlatan. I believe that he was ... seeking reputation and credibility as a scientist and writer, and he did it consistently by distorting what other scientists were saying and devising arguments based upon that distortion.\"\n\nMarshall Sahlins's 1976 work \"The Use and Abuse of Biology\" was a direct criticism of Wilson's theories.\n\nThere was also political opposition. Sociobiology re-ignited the nature and nurture debate. Wilson was accused of racism, misogyny, and sympathy to eugenics. In one incident in November 1978, his lecture was attacked by the International Committee Against Racism, a front group of the Marxist Progressive Labor Party, where one member poured a pitcher of water on Wilson's head and chanted \"Wilson, you're all wet\" at an AAAS conference. Wilson later spoke of the incident as a source of pride: \"I believe ... I was the only scientist in modern times to be physically attacked for an idea.\"\n\nObjections from evangelical Christians included those of Paul E. Rothrock in 1987: \"... sociobiology has the potential of becoming a religion of scientific materialism.\"\nPhilosopher Mary Midgley encountered \"Sociobiology\" in the process of writing \"Beast and Man\" (1996) and significantly rewrote the book to offer a critique of Wilson's views. Midgley praised the book for the study of animal behavior, clarity, scholarship, and encyclopedic scope, but extensively critiqued Wilson for conceptual confusion, scientism, and anthropomorphism of genetics.\n\nThe book and its reception were mentioned in Jonathan Haidt's book The Righteous Mind.\n\nWilson wrote in his 1978 book \"On Human Nature\", \"The evolutionary epic is probably the best myth we will ever have.\" Wilson's use of the word \"myth\" provides people with meaningful placement in time celebrating shared heritage. Wilson's fame prompted use of the morphed phrase epic of evolution. The book won the Pulitzer Prize in 1979.\n\nWilson, along with Bert Hölldobler, carried out a systematic study of ants and ant behavior, culminating in the 1990 encyclopedic work \"The Ants\". Because much self-sacrificing behavior on the part of individual ants can be explained on the basis of their genetic interests in the survival of the sisters, with whom they share 75% of their genes (though the actual case is some species' queens mate with multiple males and therefore some workers in a colony would only be 25% related), Wilson argued for a sociobiological explanation for all social behavior on the model of the behavior of the social insects.\n\nWilson has said in reference to ants \"Karl Marx was right, socialism works, it is just that he had the wrong species\". He meant that while ants and other eusocial species appear to live in communist-like societies, they only do so because they are forced to do so from their basic biology, as they lack reproductive independence: worker ants, being sterile, need their ant-queen in order to survive as a colony and a species, and individual ants cannot reproduce without a queen and are thus forced to live in centralised societies. Humans, however, do possess reproductive independence so they can give birth to offspring without the need of a \"queen\", and in fact humans enjoy their maximum level of Darwinian fitness only when they look after themselves and their offspring, while finding innovative ways to use the societies they live in for their own benefit.\n\nIn his 1998 book \"Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge\", Wilson discussed methods that have been used to unite the sciences, and might be able to unite the sciences with the humanities. Wilson used the term \"consilience\" to describe the synthesis of knowledge from different specialized fields of human endeavor. He defined human nature as a collection of epigenetic rules, the genetic patterns of mental development. He argued that culture and rituals are products, not parts, of human nature. He said art is not part of human nature, but our appreciation of art is. He suggested that concepts such as art appreciation, fear of snakes, or the incest taboo (Westermarck effect) could be studied by scientific methods of the natural sciences and be part of interdisciplinary research.\n\nThe book was mentioned in Jonathan Haidt's book The Righteous Mind.\n\nWilson coined the phrase \"scientific humanism\" as \"the only worldview compatible with science's growing knowledge of the real world and the laws of nature\". Wilson argued that it is best suited to improve the human condition. In 2003, he was one of the signers of the \"Humanist Manifesto\".\n\nOn the question of God, Wilson has described his position as \"provisional deism\" and explicitly denied the label of \"atheist\", preferring \"agnostic\". He has explained his faith as a trajectory away from traditional beliefs: \"I drifted away from the church, not definitively agnostic or atheistic, just Baptist & Christian no more.\" Wilson argues that the belief in God and rituals of religion are products of evolution. He argues that they should not be rejected or dismissed, but further investigated by science to better understand their significance to human nature. In his book \"The Creation\", Wilson suggests that scientists ought to \"offer the hand of friendship\" to religious leaders and build an alliance with them, stating that \"Science and religion are two of the most potent forces on Earth and they should come together to save the creation.\"\n\nWilson made an appeal to the religious community on the lecture circuit at Midland College, Texas, for example, and that \"the appeal received a 'massive reply'\", that a covenant had been written and that a \"partnership will work to a substantial degree as time goes on\".\n\nIn a \"New Scientist\" interview published on 21 January 2015, Wilson said that \"Religion 'is dragging us down' and must be eliminated 'for the sake of human progress, and \"So I would say that for the sake of human progress, the best thing we could possibly do would be to diminish, to the point of eliminating, religious faiths.\"\n\nWilson has said that, if he could start his life over he would work in microbial ecology, when discussing the reinvigoration of his original fields of study since the 1960s. He studied the mass extinctions of the 20th century and their relationship to modern society, and in 1998 argued for an ecological approach at the Capitol:\n\nWilson has been part of the international conservation movement, as a consultant to Columbia University's Earth Institute, as a director of the American Museum of Natural History, Conservation International, The Nature Conservancy and the World Wildlife Fund.\n\nUnderstanding the scale of the extinction crisis has led him to advocate for forest protection, including the \"Act to Save America's Forests\", first introduced in 1998, until 2008, but never passed. The Forests Now Declaration calls for new markets-based mechanisms to protect tropical forests. In 2014, Wilson called for setting aside 50% of the earth's surface for other species to thrive in as the only possible strategy to solve the extinction crisis.\n\nWilson's scientific and conservation honors include:\n\n\n\n\n"}

The forest trees release water vapor into the atmosphere through transpiration and this moisture is deposited in other localities in the form of precipitation, forming a virtual river.\n\nAn average forest tree will release 1000 litres (220 imp gal; 264 US gal) of water vapor into the atmosphere every day. It has been found that whereas every square metre of the surface of the sea evaporates one litre of water each day, the same area of forest evaporates about eight times as much because of the multiple layers of foliage in the crown of the trees. The main airflow in the Amazon basin is towards the southwest. When this air mass reaches the Andes, the mountain range acts as a \"natural barrier\", redirecting huge volumes of humid air towards central and southern Brazil as well as towards northern Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay, and rain falls in these areas. Some part of this air manages to surmount the cordillera and deposits rain in Peru. Other air masses travel northwards from the Amazon basin, passing over Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, French Guiana, and Suriname.\n\nIn 2009 Antonio Nobre, a Brazilian climate scientist, stated that without the flying river, much of southern Brazil, which produces approximately 70% of the country's GNP, would be arid desert. Clearing the Amazon forest for logging and agriculture is likely to result in lower yields elsewhere. Smoke from the fires set by some farmers to clear land sends particles into the atmosphere, resulting in diminished precipitation, which in turn leaves the trees, which have evolved in wet conditions, vulnerable to fire. The drought in southern Brazil in 2010 is believed to be due to the drying up of the flying rivers, and the even worse 2014-5 drought is also attributed to this.\n\nWith its large surface area and abundant rainfall, Brazil receives more rain in a year (estimated at ) than any other country. In 2007, the Swiss-Brazilian pilot Gérard Moss joined with scientists to initiate a project to evaluate the source of the atmospheric water over Brazil and examine the possibility that recent droughts in the country are being caused by the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest. This is the Flying Rivers Project. The primary objective of the project is to \"try to ascertain the origin of the water vapour, rainwater and river water in the areas crossed by the flying rivers\". Other objectives are to scientifically evaluate the processes involved in this water transfer and to educate the public in understanding the importance of the Amazon rainforest as a source of the water that is vital for their lives and the economy.\n"}

Denmark is located southwest of Sweden and due south of Norway and is bordered by the German state (and former possession) Schleswig-Holstein to the south, on Denmark's only land border, 68 kilometres (42 miles) long.\n\nDenmark borders both the Baltic and North Seas along its tidal shoreline. Denmark's general coastline is much shorter, at , as it would not include most of the 1,419 offshore islands (each defined as exceeding 100 square meters in area) and the 180 km long Limfjorden, which separates Denmark's second largest island, North Jutlandic Island, 4,686 km in size, from the rest of Jutland. No location in Denmark is further from the coast than . The size of the land area of Denmark cannot be stated exactly since the ocean constantly erodes and adds material to the coastline, and because of human land reclamation projects (to counter erosion).

Denmark has 443 named islands (1,419 islands above 100 m²), of which 72 are inhabited (, Statistics Denmark). The largest islands are Zealand \"(Sjælland)\" and Funen \"(Fyn)\". The island of Bornholm is located east of the rest of the country, in the Baltic Sea. Many of the larger islands are connected by bridges; the Øresund Bridge connects Zealand with Sweden; the Great Belt Bridge connects Funen with Zealand; and the Little Belt Bridge connects Jutland with Funen. Ferries or small aircraft connect to the smaller islands. Main cities are the capital Copenhagen on Zealand; Århus, Aalborg and Esbjerg in Jutland; and Odense on Funen.\n\nDenmark experiences a temperate climate. This means that the winters are mild and windy and the summers are cool. The local terrain is generally flat with a few gently rolling plains. The territory of Denmark includes the island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea and the rest of metropolitan Denmark, but excludes the Faroe Islands and Greenland.

{"id": "23304518", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23304518", "title": "Italian Renaissance garden", "text": "Italian Renaissance garden\n\nThe Italian Renaissance garden was a new style of garden which emerged in the late 15th century at villas in Rome and Florence, inspired by classical ideals of order and beauty, and intended for the pleasure of the view of the garden and the landscape beyond, for contemplation, and for the enjoyment of the sights, sounds and smells of the garden itself.\n\nIn the late Renaissance, the gardens became larger, grander and more symmetrical, and were filled with fountains, statues, grottoes, water organs and other features designed to delight their owners and amuse and impress visitors. The style was imitated throughout Europe, influencing the gardens of the French Renaissance and the English garden.\n\nPrior to the Italian Renaissance, Italian Medieval gardens were enclosed by walls, and were devoted to growing vegetables, fruits and medicinal herbs, or, in the case of monastery gardens, for silent meditation and prayer. The Italian Renaissance garden broke down the wall between the garden, the house, and the landscape outside.\n\nThe Italian Renaissance garden, like Renaissance art and architecture, emerged from the rediscovery by Renaissance scholars of classical Roman models. They were inspired by the descriptions of ancient Roman gardens given by Ovid in his \"Metamorphoses\"; by the letters of Pliny the Younger, by Pliny the Elder's \"Naturalis Historia\"; and in \"Rerum Rusticanum\" by Varro, all of which gave detailed and lyrical description of the gardens of Roman villas.\n\nPliny the Younger described his life at his villa at Laurentum: \" ...a good life and a genuine one, which is happy and honourable, more rewarding than any \"business\" can be. You should take the first opportunity to leave the din, the futile bustle and useless occupations of the city and devote yourself to literature or to leisure.\" The purpose of a garden, according to Pliny, was \"otium,\" which could be translated as seclusion, serenity, or relaxation, which was the opposite of the idea of \"negotium\" that often classified busy urban life. A garden was a place to think, relax, and escape.\n\nPliny described shaded paths bordered with hedges, ornamental parterres, fountains, and trees and bushes trimmed to geometric or fantastic shapes; all features which would become part of the future Renaissance garden.\n\nThe first Renaissance text to include garden design was \"De Re Aedificatoria\" ('The Ten Books of Architecture'), by Leon Battista Alberti (1404–1472). He drew upon the architectural principles of Vitruvius, and used quotations from Pliny the Elder and Pliny the Younger to describe what a garden should look like and how it should be used. He argued that a villa should both be looked at and a place to look from; that the house should be placed above the garden, where it could be seen and the owner could look down into the garden.\n\nAlberti wrote: \"The construction will give pleasure to the visitor if, when they leave the city, they see the villa in all its charm, as if to seduce and welcome the new arrivals. Toward this end, I would place it on a slightly elevated place. I would also have the road climb so gently that it fools those who take it to the point that they do not realize how high they have climbed until they discover the countryside below.\"\n\nWithin the garden, Alberti wrote: \"...You should place porticos for giving shade, planters where vines can climb, placed on marble columns; vases and amusing statues, provided they are not obscene. You should also have rare plants... Trees should be aligned and arranged evenly, each tree aligned with its neighbours.\"\n\nA popular romance, \"The Hypnerotomachia Poliphili,\" (\"Poliphilo's Strife of Love in a Dream\"), published in 1499 in Venice by the monk Francesco Colonna, also had an important influence on the gardens of the Renaissance. It described the voyage and adventures of a traveller, Poliphile, through fantastic landscapes, looking for his love, Polia. The scenes described in the book and the accompanying woodcut illustrations influenced many Renaissance gardens; they included a lake-island (as at the Boboli Gardens), giants emerging from the earth (as at Villa di Pratolino), the labyrinth, and the fountain of Venus (as at Villa di Castello) where Poliphile and Polia were reconciled.\n\nWhile the early Italian Renaissance gardens were designed for contemplation and pleasure with tunnels of greenery, trees for shade, an enclosed \" giardino segreto\" (secret garden) and fields for games and amusements, the Medici, the ruling dynasty of Florence, used gardens to demonstrate their own power and magnificence. \"During the first half of the sixteenth century, magnificence came to be perceived as a princely virtue, and all over the Italian peninsula architects, sculptors, painters, poets, historians and humanist scholars were commissioned to concoct a magnificent image for their powerful patrons.\" The central fountain at Villa di Castello featured a statue of Hercules defeating Antaeus, alluding to the triumph of the garden's builder, Cosimo de' Medici. over a faction of Florentine nobles who had tried to overthrow him. The garden was a form of political theater, presenting the power, wisdom, order, beauty and glory that the Medici had brought to Florence.\n\n\nThe oldest existing Italian Renaissance garden is at the Villa Medici in Fiesole, north of Florence. It was created sometime between 1455 and 1461 by Giovanni de' Medici (1421–1463) the son of Cosimo de' Medici, the founder of the Medici dynasty. Unlike other Medici family villas that were located on flat farmland, this villa was located on a rocky hillside with a view over Florence.\n\nThe Villa Medici followed Alberti's precepts that a villa should have a view 'that overlooks the city, the owner's land, the sea or a great plain, and familiar hills and mountains,' and that the foreground have 'the delicacy of gardens.' The garden has two large terraces, one at the ground floor level and the other at the level of the first floor. From the reception rooms on the first floor, guests could go out to the loggia and from there to the garden so the loggia was a transition space connecting the interior with the exterior. Unlike later gardens, the Villa Medici did not have a grand staircase or other feature to link the two levels.\n\nThe garden was inherited by his nephew, Lorenzo de' Medici, who made it a meeting place for poets, artists, writers and philosophers. In 1479, the poet Angelo Poliziano, tutor to the Medici children, described the garden in a letter: \"..Seated between the sloping sides of the mountains we have here water in abundance and being constantly refreshed with moderate winds find little inconvenience from the glare of the sun. As you approach the house it seems embosomed in the wood, but when you reach it you find it commands a full prospect of the city.\"\n\nThe Palazzo Piccolomini at Pienza, was built by Enea Silvio Piccolomini, who was Pope from 1458 to 1464, under the name of Pius II. He was a scholar of Latin and wrote extensively on education, astronomy and social culture. In 1459, he constructed a palace for himself and his Cardinals and court in his small native town of Pienza. Like the Villa Medici, a major feature of the house was the commanding view to be had from the loggia over the valley, the Val d'Orcia, to the slopes of Mount Amiata. Closer to the house, there were terraces with geometric flowerbeds surrounding fountains and ornamented with bushes trimmed into cones and spheres similar to the garden of Pliny described in Alberti's \"De Re Aedificatoria\". The garden was designed to open to the town, the palace and the view.\n\nIn 1504, Pope Julius II commissioned the architect Donato Bramante to recreate a classical Roman pleasure garden in the space between the old papal Vatican palace in Rome and the nearby Villa Belvedere. His model was the ancient sanctuary of Fortuna Primigenia at Palestrina or ancient Praeneste, and he used the classical ideals of proportion, symmetry and perspective in his design. He created a central axis to link the two buildings, and a series of terraces connected by double ramps, modelled after those at Palestrina. The terraces were divided into squares and rectangles by paths and flowerbeds, and served as an outdoor setting for Pope Julius's extraordinary collection of classical sculpture, which included the famous Laocoön and the Apollo Belvedere. The heart of the garden was a courtyard surrounded by a three-tiered loggia, which served as a theater for entertainments. A central exedra formed the dramatic conclusion of the long perspective up the courtyard, ramps and terraces.\n\nThe Venetian Ambassador described the Cortile del Belvedere in 1523: \"One enters a very beautiful garden, of which half is filled with growing grass and bays and mulberries and cypresses, while the other half is paved with squares of bricks laid upright, and in every square a beautiful orange tree grows out of the pavement, of which there are a great many, arranged in perfect order...On one side of the garden is a most beautiful loggia, at one end of which is a lovely fountain that irrigates the orange trees and the rest of the garden by a little canal in the center of the loggia.\"\n\nUnfortunately, the construction of the Vatican Library in the late 16th century across the centre of the \"cortile\" means that Bramante's design is now obscured but his ideas of proportion, symmetry and dramatic perspectives were used in many of the great gardens of the Italian Renaissance.\n\nThe Villa Madama, situated on the slopes of Monte Mario and overlooking Rome, was begun by Pope Leo X and continued by Cardinal Giulio de' Medici (1478–1534). In 1516 Leo X gave the commission to Raphael who was at that time the most famous artist in Rome. Using the ancient text of \"De Architectura\" by Vitruvius and the writings of Pliny the Younger, Raphael imagined his own version of an ideal classical villa and garden. His villa had a great circular courtyard, and was divided into a winter apartment and a summer apartment. Passages led from the courtyard to the great loggia from which views could be gained of the garden and Rome. A round tower on the east side was intended as garden room in winter, warmed by the sun coming through glazed windows. The villa overlooked three terraces, one a square, one a circle, and one an oval. The top terrace was to be planted in chestnut trees and firs while the lower terrace was intended for plant beds.\n\nWork on the Villa Madama stopped in 1520, after the death of Raphael, but was then continued by other artists until 1534. They finished one-half of the villa including half of the circular courtyard, and the northwest loggia that was decorated with grotesque frescoes by Giulio Romano and stucco by Giovanni da Udine. Fine surviving features include a fountain of the head of an elephant by Giovanni da Udine and two gigantic stucco figures by Baccio Bandinelli at the entrance of the \"giardino segreto\", the secret garden. The villa is now a state guest house for the Government of Italy.\n\nThe middle of the 16th century saw the construction by the Medicis and other wealthy families and individuals, of a series of magnificent gardens that followed the principles of Alberti and Bramante; they were usually sited on a hilltop or slopes of a mountain; had a series of symmetrical terraces, one above the other, along a central axis; the house looked over the garden and landscape beyond and it could itself be seen from the bottom of the garden. Developments in hydrology meant that the gardens were equipped with increasingly elaborate and majestic cascades and fountains, and statues which recalled the grandeur of Ancient Rome.\n\nVilla di Castello was the project of Cosimo I de' Medici, first Duke of Tuscany, begun when he was only seventeen. It was designed by Niccolò Tribolo who designed two other gardens: the Giardino dei Semplici (1545) and the Boboli Gardens (1550) for Cosimo.\n\nThe garden was laid out on a gentle slope between the villa and the hill of Monte Morello. Tribolo first built a wall across the slope, dividing it into an upper garden filled with orange trees, and a lower garden that was subdivided into garden rooms with walls of hedges, rows of trees and tunnels of citrus trees and cedars. A central axis, articulated by a series of fountains, extended from the villa up to the base of Monte Morello. In this arrangement, the garden had both grand perspectives and enclosed, private spaces\n\nThe lower garden had a large marble fountain that was meant to be seen against a backdrop of dark cypresses, with figures of Hercules and Antaeus. Just above this fountain, in the centre of the garden, was a labyrinth formed by cypress, laurel, myrtle, roses, and box hedges. Concealed in the middle of the labyrinth was another fountain, with a statue of Venus. Around this fountain, Cosimo had bronze pipes installed under the tiles for \"giochi d'acqua\" (\"water tricks\"), which were concealed conduits which could be turned on with a key to drench unsuspecting guests. Another unusual feature was a tree house concealed in an ivy-covered oak tree, with a square dining room inside the tree.\n\nAt the far end of the garden and set against a wall, Tribolo created an elaborate grotto, decorated with mosaics, pebbles, sea shells, imitation stalactites, and niches with groups of statues of domestic and exotic animals and birds, many with real horns, antlers and tusks. The animals symbolized the virtues and accomplishments of past members of Medici family. Water flowed from the beaks, wings and claws of the animals into marble basins below each niche. A gate could close suddenly behind visitors, and they would be soaked by hidden fountains.\n\nAbove the grotto, on the hillside, was small wood, or \"bosco\", with a pond in the center. In the pond is a bronze statue of a shivering giant, with cold water running down over his head, which represents either the month of January or the Apennine Mountains.\n\nWhen the last of the Medicis died in 1737, the garden began to be altered by its new owners, the House of Lorraine; the labyrinth was demolished and the statue of Venus was moved to the Villa La Petraia. But long before then, the garden had been described by many ambassadors and foreign visitors and had become famous throughout Europe. Its principles of perspective, proportion and symmetry, its geometric planting beds and rooms with walls of trees and hedges, were adapted in both the gardens of the French Renaissance and the garden à la française which followed.\n\nThe Villa d'Este at Tivoli is one of the grandest and best-preserved of the Italian Renaissance gardens. It was created by Cardinal Ippolito II d'Este, son of Alfonso I d'Este, the Duke of Ferrara, and Lucrezia Borgia. He was made a Cardinal at the age of twenty-nine and became governor of Tivoli in 1550. To develop his residence, he took over a former Franciscan convent, and for the garden he bought the adjoining steep hillside and the valley below. His chosen architect was Pirro Ligorio, who had been carrying out excavations for Ippolito at the nearby ruins of the ancient \"Villa Adriana\", or Hadrian's Villa, the extensive country residence of the Roman Emperor, Hadrian, that had numerous elaborate water features.\n\nLigorio created the garden as a series of terraces descending the steep hillside at the edge of the mountains overlooking the plain of Latium. The terraces were connected by gates and grand stairways starting from a terrace below the villa and traversing down to the Fountain of Dragons at the foot of the garden. The stairway was crossed by five traversal alleys on the different levels, which were divided into rooms by hedges and trellises covered with vines. At the crossing points of the stairway and the alleys there were pavilions, fruit trees, and aromatic plants. At the top, the promenade used by the Cardinal passed below the villa and led in one direction to the grotto of Diana, and in the other to the grotto of Asclepius.\n\nThe glory of the Villa d'Este was the system of fountains, fed by two aqueducts that Ligorio constructed from the River Aniene. In the centre of the garden, the alley of one hundred fountains (which actually had two hundred fountains), crossed the hillside, connecting the Oval Fountain with the Fountain of Rome, which was decorated with models of the famous landmarks of Rome. On a lower level, another alley passed by the Fountain of Dragons and joined the Fountain of Proserpina with the Fountain of the Owl. Still lower, an alley of fishponds connected the Fountain of the Organ to the site of a proposed Fountain of Neptune.\n\nEach fountain and path told a story, linking the d'Este family to the legends of Hercules and Hippolytus or \"Ippolito\", the mythical son of Theseus and Hippolyta, the Queen of the Amazons. The central axis led to the Fountain of Dragons, which illustrated one of the labours of Hercules, and three other statues of Hercules were found in the garden. The myth of Ippolito, the mythical namesake of the owner, was illustrated by two grottos, that of Asclepius and Diana.\n\nThe Fountain of the Owl used a series of bronze pipes like flutes to make the sound of birds but the most famous feature of the garden was the great Organ Fountain. It was described by the French philosopher Michel de Montaigne, who visited the garden in 1580: \"The music of the Organ Fountain is true music, naturally created...made by water which falls with great violence into a cave, rounded and vaulted, and agitates the air, which is forced to exit through the pipes of an organ. Other water, passing through a wheel, strikes in a certain order the keyboard of the organ. The organ also imitates the sound of trumpets, the sound of cannon, and the sound of muskets, made by the sudden fall of water ...\n\nThe garden was substantially changed after the death of the Cardinal and in the 17th century, and many statues were sold, but the basic features remain, and the Organ Fountain has recently been restored and plays music once again.\n\nMannerism was a style which developed in painting in the 1520s, which defied the traditional rules of Renaissance painting. \"Mannerist paintings were intensely stylish, polished and complex, their composition bizarre, the subject matter fantastic.\" This also describes other mannerist gardens which appeared beginning about 1560.\n\nThe Villa della Tore, built for Giulio della Torre (1480–1563), a law professor and humanist scholar in Verona, was a parody of the classical rules of Vitruvius; the peristyle of the building was in the perfectly harmonious Vitruvius style, but some of the stones were rough-cut and of different sizes and decorated with masks which sprayed water, which jarred the classical harmony. \"The building was deformed: it seemed to be caught in a strange, amorphous condition, somewhere crude rustic simplicity and classical perfection.\" The fireplaces inside were in the forms of the mouths of gigantic masks. Outside, the garden was filled with disturbing architectural elements, including a grotto whose entrance represented the mouth of hell, with eyes that showed fires burning inside.\n\nThe Sacro Bosco, or \"Sacred Wood,\" was the most famous and extravagant of the Mannerist gardens. It was created for Pier Francesco Orsini (1523–84) near the village of Bomarzo. It was witty and irreverent, and violated all the rules of Renaissance gardens; it had no symmetry, no order, and no focal point. An inscription in the garden said: \"You who have travelled the world in search of great and stupendous marvels, come here, where there are horrendous faces, elephants, lions, ogres and dragons.\"\n\nThe garden was filled with enormous statues, reached by wandering paths. It included a mouth of hell, a house that seemed to be falling over, fantastic animals and figures, many of them carved of rough volcanic rock in place in the garden. Some of the scenes were taken from the romantic epic poem Orlando Furioso by Ludovico Ariosto, others from works by Dante Alighieri and Francesco Petrarch. As one inscription in the garden notes, the \"Sacro Bosco\" \"resembles only itself, and nothing else.\" \n\nThe Italian Renaissance also saw a revolution in the study of botany through the systematic classification of plants and the creation of the first botanical gardens. During the Middle Ages, plants were studied for the medicinal uses. Until the 16th century, the standard work on botany was \"De Materia Medica\" written in the 1st century AD by a Greek physician, Pedanius Dioscorides, that described six hundred plants but lacked many of the native plants of Italy and had vague descriptions with stylized and inexact illustrations. In 1533, the University of Padua created the first chair of botany and appointed Francesco Bonafede as the first \"Professor Simplicium\"- professor of 'simples,' or medicinal plants. In 1545, a scholar from the medical school of the University of Padua, Pietro Andrea Mattioli, wrote a new book on medicinal herbs, \"Commentarii in libros sex Pedanii Dioscoridis\", which, in successive editions, systematically described and gave the medicinal uses of twelve hundred different plants. Such scientific work was aided by sailors and explorers returning from the New World, Asia and Africa, who brought back samples of plants unknown in Europe.\n\nIn June 1543, the University of Padua created the world's first botanical garden, the Orto botanico di Padova, and the University of Pisa followed with its own garden, the Orto botanico di Pisa, in 1545. By 1591, the garden at Padua had over 1,168 different plants and trees, including a fan palm tree brought from Egypt. In 1545, in Florence, Cosimo de' Medici founded the \"Giardino dei Semplici\", the garden of medicinal herbs. Soon the medical schools of the universities of Bologna, Ferrara and Sassari all had their own botanical gardens filled with exotic plants from around the world.\n\n\n\n"}

Hadži-Vasiljević was born in Vranje, at the time part of the Sanjak of Niš of the Ottoman Empire until it was captured by the Serbian Army in 1878. His father was Hadži Vasilije of the Pogačarević family, and his mother Katerina was the daughter of the churchwarden (\"ikonom\") of Kumanovo, Dimitrije Mladenović (1794–1880). The Pogačarević family (also known as \"Pogačarci\") hailed from Rakovac, having settled in Vranje at the end of the 18th century. He finished primary school in Vranje, gymnasium in Vranje and Niš, and the Great School in Belgrade at the History and Philology faculty. He received his Philosophy doctorate at the University of Vienna in 1898. As an official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs he served from 1898 to 1904 in Bitola, Skopje and Belgrade. After he left the civil service in 1904, he was the secretary of the Society of Saint Sava until 1940. Throughout his life he worked for the national enlightenment of Serbs in the Ottoman Empire. He participated in the Balkan Wars and the First World War. He retreated with the Second Morava Division through Albania, which he described. Hadži-Vasiljević wrote extensively on history, geography and ethnology. The high value of his work is due to the basis on field research, especially in the areas of Old Serbia and Macedonia (South Serbia). He wrote over 200 historical and ethnographical works about those regions. He was the editor of the \"Brastvo\" journal of the Society of Saint Sava.\n\nAmong his most notable works are:\n\nA street is named after him in Vranje.

An Australian version was also produced. John Inman was the only actor to appear in all three series.\n\nOf the cast throughout the duration of the series and its sequel, all are deceased with the exception of Mike Berry, Penny Irving, Doremy Vernon, Vivienne Johnson and Candy Davis.\n\nThis section contains information on the characters who worked in the Menswear department of Grace Brothers.\n\nMr Wilberforce Claybourne Humphries (John Inman), sales assistant, later senior assistant in menswear. Mr Humphries' colleagues and 'best friends' (although he denied this) were Mr Lucas and Mr Spooner. His ambiguous sexuality was used as a catalyst for many comedic situations and one-liners. Mr Humphries was particularly noted for his mincing walk and his slightly high-pitched voice, which he discarded when answering the phone: \"MENSWEAR\", he intoned in a falsified baritone. He had one of the most famous catchphrases of the era: when asked by a colleague, \" Mr Humphries, are you free?\" (to serve a customer), he always gave the exaggerated response, \"I'm free!\" in a very high pitched voice. As the series progressed he often arrived late at work in increasingly outrageous attire including punk rocker clothing and hair, motorcycle leather jacket and chaps, and a sailor uniform, always with an equally outrageous account of his previous night's activities and his efforts to make it to work on time nonetheless. On one occasion, Mr Lucas opined to him after a description of the previous evening: \"It's all go at your place!\" Mr Humphries frequently spoke of a companion or companions referred to only as \"my friend\", often in a situation that pertained in some way to the subject under discussion. Everyone always assumed that the friends that he mentioned were men and would sometimes ask about them, and Mr Humphries would answer back, \"What makes you think it's a 'he'?!\", often in a voice lowered by an octave. He was born in 1938/39, so throughout the show, his age was 33/34 - 46/47. He is often described as the most loveable character in the show, and was shown to be the most popular member of the floor in 'Shedding the Load' when he was the only member of staff not to receive a vote to be sacked. In \"Heir Apparent\", Old Mr Grace believes that Mr Humphries was his son and all the staff are spoiling him.\n\nMr James/Dick Lucas (Trevor Bannister) was the 'Jack the lad' junior menswear assistant, who was nearly always late for work but always had a creative excuse. He was not very concerned about the departmental pecking order, and made many sarcastic remarks, usually towards Mrs Slocombe. In the early series he had a relationship with Miss Brahms, as mentioned in 'Big Brother', however by later episodes she seems to have developed an antipathy towards him. Mr Lucas once called himself the 'best friend' of Mr Humphries, who was quick to deny it. His departure is never explained, although Captain Peacock remarked in the episode \"Sit Out\" after Mr Lucas left, on a day in which the departments had achieved no sales, that the last time the departments had no sales, \"we fired the junior.\" Mr Lucas was thus made redundant, or terminated at will. (In real life, Trevor Bannister had already accepted a part in a tour for Middle Age Spread so he was unable to continue the role of Mr Lucas.) In the series Mr Lucas represents fresh, modern thinking contrasted with the stale, old-fashioned thinking that permeates Grace Brothers. In a series 5 episode, Mr Grace decides to Americanise the store, and the staff must call each other by their first names; Mr Lucas embarrassingly reveals to his co-workers that his first name is Dick, much to the delight of Mr Humphries. In \"Shedding The Load\" he signs a letter as Dick Lucas. But in the series 2 episode \"The Clock\", Mr Mash addresses him as Mr James Lucas. Despite being the department junior, Bannister was, in fact, one year older than Inman.\n\nMr Ernest Grainger (Arthur Brough) was the original senior of the menswear department; he had been with Grace Brothers for over four decades. He resented being forced to share the floor with the Ladies Department. He vaguely resembled Winston Churchill, in both appearance and demeanour, and had done impressions of him during the war while in ENSA. Mr Grainger often fell asleep at work, and failed to wake up when called, unless Mr Humphries asked him \"Mr Grainger! Are you free?\" When flabbergasted or grumpy, Mr Humphries would often come to his aid and call: \"Glass of water for Mr Grainger!\" \nLittle is known about his personal life, except his marriage, an illegitimate child from the 1950s with \"a girl from haberdashery\" and a sister.\n\nUnlike his successors, Mr Tebbs and Mr Goldberg, who only lasted one series, and Mr Grossman and Mr Klein, who only lasted four episodes, Mr Grainger lasted five series and was thus the longest-serving menswear senior. Like Mr Rumbold, he was bald. He was 65 in 1974, so was born in 1909.\n\nAlthough he generally got along well with the others, Mr Grainger was sometimes cranky and bad-tempered and would protest and become resentful whenever the menswear department had to share valuable space with the ladies, or when Captain Peacock would nonchalantly mention a perk he had earned despite having served less time at the store than Mr Grainger (such as a visit to the company boardroom). Once he had the opportunity to fill in for Mr Rumbold who was away for a one-month conference (this was a nice gesture, as it entitled Mr Grainger to a slightly bigger pension) but the position went to his head: he took advantage of all Mr. Rumbold's perks (in particular the liquor cabinet and cigars), but imposed strict discipline on the rest of the staff: he threatened to make an adverse entry in Peacock's personnel record and he actually sacked Mrs Slocombe (however, he did repent his ways by the end of the episode). His character left when Arthur Brough died on 28 May 1978, while the sixth series was in pre-production. He was being written into the scripts at this time.\n\nMr Percival Tebbs (James Hayter) was Mr Grainger's first replacement as menswear senior, following the death of Arthur Brough (1978) who played Grainger. He shared many traits with his predecessor, but unlike the somewhat sloppy Mr Grainger, he was obsessed with order and propriety and considered himself an excellent salesman. He was also an overachiever and received a number of recognitions from Grace Brothers for his contributions. \nAlthough he was generally as rigid and somewhat stuffy as Mr Grainger, he did have a sense of humour about him, and particularly enjoyed, like Mr Lucas, insulting Mrs Slocombe, whom he considered to be a \"crabby old cow\". After only one year in the show, Mr Tebbs retired from Grace Brothers; Mr Tebbs' departure was the only one addressed by the series (as his retirement party at Grace Brothers is shown).\n\nMr Goldberg (Alfie Bass) replaced Mr Tebbs as menswear senior; he originally took on the junior position, while Mr Humphries and Mr Lucas were respectively promoted to Senior Assistants. However, Mr Goldberg had all of his friends' purchase goods from him the very next day after he was hired. As a result, he was quickly promoted to menswear senior, and Mr Humphries and Mr Lucas returned to their former positions. Goldberg often tried to supplement his wages, for example by establishing his own recruitment agency (and recruiting Grace Brothers' employees away to better-paying jobs). At his job interview, he revealed that he had spent time in the Army with Captain Peacock, to the shock and amusement of all except Captain Peacock. A slick businessman, Mr Goldberg allegedly burned down his own store for insurance purposes. In order to remain at Grace Brothers he blackmailed Captain Peacock with a picture of them in the army which showed Peacock in a corporal's uniform. Mr Goldberg was much more relaxed than his predecessors and was, in general, a friendly presence.\n\nMr Bert Spooner (Mike Berry) (born 1942, aged 38–43), Mr Lucas's replacement, was similar to him in many ways: He was friends with Mr Humphries, he was sarcastic and lazy, but generally a lot less witty and charming. He made rude remarks, most frequently towards Mrs Slocombe (often being made to change tables in the canteen for this), didn't get on with Captain Peacock and had a hinted affair with Miss Brahms. In the final episode, he was demoted to lift operator but was quickly reinstated when he became a pop star.\n\nMr Grossman (Milo Sperber) joined the clothing department after Young Mr Grace suggested having a small section of the men's and lady's department made into an area to sell shoes. Little is known about him as he only appeared in four episodes, although his first episode, in which he was transferred from the Shoe Department, revealed him to be an expert in shoe sales. Mr Grossman was a relaxed and friendly influence in the Men's Department and also spoke with a foreign accent.\n\nMr Klein (Benny Lee), joined the department to help out with the sales but is from the Cutting Department. Speaks often of his wife, generally in disparaging tones, and doesn't object to quietly making jokes at Captain Peacock's expense. Other than that, his character remained undeveloped over his brief tenure. Like Mr Grossman, he lasted only four episodes, including the 1981 Christmas Special.\n\nThis section contains information on the characters who worked in the Ladieswear department.\n\nMrs. Mary Elizabeth Jennifer Rachel Abergavenny \"Betty\" Slocombe (née Yiddell), portrayed by Mollie Sugden was the senior in the ladies department. Born in 1926 in Blackpool. She frequently sported elaborate hairstyles with brightly coloured rinses ranging from blue to more outrageous shades. Mrs Slocombe's husband left her, or was possibly arrested by the Fraud Squad (although viewers are finally introduced to him in the second series of \"Grace & Favour\"), and she lived with her cat, Tiddles, which she referred to as \"my pussy\"; this was the source of many a double entendre, most of which Mrs Slocombe herself completely missed. Although Tiddles was generally referred to as a tomcat (male), this was contradicted in one episode when Tiddles had a litter of kittens in the store. Mrs Slocombe also tried to sound refined and \"posh\", but when exasperated or annoyed, she revealed more than a trace of a working-class Northern accent. She developed something of an adversarial relationship with Mr Lucas, and later Mr Spooner, frequently exchanging insults, despite her having gotten along reasonably well with Mr Lucas early on in the series.\n\nMiss Shirley Brahms (Wendy Richard) was the attractive junior ladieswear assistant who was often cheeky to Mrs Slocombe. Her Cockney accent was sometimes unintelligible, but she often put on a posher voice when answering the telephone. Under Mrs Slocombe's guidance, she became a more useful assistant throughout the series, though the hierarchy of Grace Brothers meant that she would have been promoted only when Mrs Slocombe left. She was attractive and receptive to the advances of Messrs Lucas, Spooner, Conway and, once or twice, Humphries. Because of her youth and life, she considers herself to have few standards. In one incident, she was approached to participate in a store-wide \"Holiday Girl\" contest with the assumption that she would easily win; but she refused, mainly because one of the prizes was a vacation aboard the yacht of Old Mr Grace, who had previously tried to indecently assault her. The biggest sale she ever made was when Mrs Slocombe was away, temporarily taking Mr Rumbold's place.\n\nThis section includes the characters who had a management role at Grace Brothers.\n\nCaptain Stephen Peacock (Frank Thornton), The somewhat stuffy floorwalker, considers himself a cut above the assistants with both his position at the store and his dubious military record; he even feels the need to brag about his experiences fighting Rommel in North Africa. But Mr. Mash likes to tell the staff that Peacock served in the Naafi instead, and probably never left England, while Mr. Goldberg hints that Peacock was actually only a corporal. Allegedly, despite his military rank, Peacock began at Grace Brothers as a sweeper in the stockroom. Although Peacock usually talks as if he were a member of the elite Commando unit, on two occasions he admits he was in the Royal Army Service Corps. He is very pedantic with the staff (in one instance admonishing Miss Brahms for being one second late for work) as well as being rather disloyal to his colleagues (believing Mr Humphries guilty of stealing money from the till in spite of knowing him for 9 years). By 1975 he had been working at Grace Brothers for 20 years. In the episode \"Front Page Story\" Mr Humphries states that Peacock is 55, meaning he must have been born in 1926, the same age as Mrs Slocombe. Captain Peacock is attracted to Mr Rumbold's secretaries, such as Miss Belfridge. His wife Mrs Peacock is seen in a number of episodes, to whom he has been married since 1959.\n\nMr Cuthbert Rumbold (Nicholas Smith, the manager of the floor, was often mocked for his bald head, large ears, and lack of intelligence. Nicknamed \"Jug Ears\", he frequently took slang phrases literally, leading to his formulating far-fetched explanations of incidents between staff members. He often took credit for others' ideas but subsequently tried to deny all involvement when the idea inevitably proved disastrous. Mr Rumbold's greatest ambition was to become a director of Grace Brothers: he looks up dreamily whenever the word \"boardroom\" is mentioned. He was usually oblivious to the sex appeal of his attractive secretaries. By the time of \"Grace and Favour\" Mrs Rumbold has left Mr Rumbold for a younger do-it-yourself man. In the episode \"Roots\" his brother Mycroft (also played by Smith) makes a brief appearance.\n\nThe Grace brothers, Young Mr Grace (Harold Bennett) and Old Mr Grace (Kenneth Waller), were the old-fashioned owners of the store. Both were old but loved young, curvaceous women. They both treated their employees with respect and encouragement, hence Young Mr Grace's catch phrase, \"You've all done very well!\" However, they were terminally naive to the fact that Grace Brothers was in its declining years. Despite the wealth of the family, they were somewhat stingy with money and paid their workers terribly, causing many strikes, disagreements and disruptions. Young Mr Grace started off as a fish salesman before inheriting the store from an uncle in 1926. Old Mr Grace remained an unseen character until series eight, and there was a recurring joke for many years in which, upon seeing Young Mr Grace for the first time, someone would ask in surprise, \"That's \"Young\" Mr Grace?\" The other person always replied, \"Old Mr Grace doesn't get about much these days.\" Ironically, when he finally did appear in the show, Kenneth Waller (as Old Mr Grace) twenty-eight years \"younger\" than Harold Bennett (as Young Mr Grace), and thus the character was in much better condition both mentally and physically. It was revealed that Young Mr Grace had a wife who died in 1935. Young Mr Grace's age was a mystery. In 1976, it was said he was 80, yet in 1977, it was said he was born in 1897, and his 80th birthday was celebrated in that episode. In 1978, it was said that it was his 80th birthday then. Old Mr Grace was born in 1891, and celebrated his 90th birthday in 1981. He was married to Annie Grainger (as stated in Heir Apparent) but in that episode though he was married to Mr Humphries's mother. At some point, Young Mr Grace had a heart attack and was left with a very weak heart afterwards. Whenever his secretary showed off her legs, it would have a terrible effect on his heart. Both Old and Young Mr Grace are last seen in the episode \"Roots\".\n\nThis section includes characters who worked in Maintenance & Packing.\n\nMr. Mash (Larry Martyn) was a Grace Brothers maintenance man. He was frequently reprimanded by Captain Peacock for appearing on the sales floor during business hours, but had no fear of his superiors. He had a thorough knowledge of store operations and was a union agitator. He often bragged of taking home much larger pay cheques than the sales assistants due to overtime. Mr. Mash departed before Season 4, and replaced by Mr. Harman.\n\nMr. Harman (Arthur English) replaced Mr. Mash in Series 4 as maintenance man. He shared some traits with Mr. Mash: both were \"common\" sorts and union men; and like Mash he battled with Captain Peacock over his appearances on the floor during store open hours. However, he was considerably less militant and was more friendly towards the sales staff than Mr. Mash. Reciprocally, the other staff were much more accepting of him than they had been of Mr. Mash, and he frequently acted as a member of the group and not just as an antagonist. He graciously assisted Mrs. Slocombe in the episode \"The Apartment\", when she was allowed to stay on the top floor of the building, by setting up various items of furniture and displays so that she could have all the creature comforts. He also masterminded the deception in \"The Hold Up\", dressing up as the leader of \"The Gumby Gang\" in order to fool the burglars who were holding Miss Brahms, Captain Peacock and Mr. Spooner hostage in Mr. Rumbold's office. Mr. Harman was last seen in \"The Pop Star\" (1984) which was the last episode of \"Are You Being Served?\" and therefore didn't appear in the sequel \"Grace and Favour\".\n\nWarwick (Jimmy Mac) and Seymour (Keith Hodiak) were both assistants to Mr. Harman in later series. Warwick made brief appearances from series six to series nine and Seymour appeared more visibly in three episodes of series ten. Two other assistants appeared throughout, one unnamed in one episode in series five and one named Stanford in two episodes in series nine.\n\nThis section lists details of the numerous secretaries who served Young Mr. Grace, Old Mr. Grace and Mr. Rumbold during the series:\n\nThe first secretary to appear in the series was played by Stephanie Gathercole (who also provided the lift girl voice used in the theme song). Little is known about her, but she is wise to Mr. Lucas's tricks - when he walks past her, she wisely places a clipboard in front of her bottom. She appeared in the Pilot, Series 1 and one episode in Series 2.\n\nMiss Ainsworth, played by Nina Francis, was Mr. Rumbold's secretary in \"The Hand of Fate\" and \"Coffee Morning\" (series 3).\n\nMoira Foot played Miss Thorpe, who appeared as Mr Rumbold's new but temporary secretary in the episodes 'German Week', 'Shoulder to Shoulder' and 'New Look'. Her good looks attracted the attentions of Captain Peacock and even Young Mr Grace.\n\nIsabella Rye appeared as Mr. Rumbold's secretary in \"Forward, Mr. Grainger\". She was said to have been reassigned from Young Mr. Grace's office because she was bad for his blood pressure.\n\nMiss Monica Hazelwood appeared as Mr Rumbold's secretary in 'Oh, What A Tangled Web' when Mrs. Peacock accused her and Captain Peacock of having an affair. She had just dumped her fiancé and was not in a stable mood - and neither was Mrs. Peacock. The situation also made her father smash her wedding cake over Mr. Grainger's head.\n\nMiss Bakewell (Penny Irving), Young Mr Grace's longest running and most loyal secretary, appeared from season 4 to season 7. She also appeared in the Are You Being Served? (film), but with her name changed to \"Miss Nicholson\". Her good looks often attracted the attention of the male staff at Grace Brothers.\n\nVirginia Edwards is Old Mr. Grace's Deputy Secretary. She seems to pal up with Mr. Grace's nurse. In her interview, she sits on Mr. Grace's knee and types a letter, with one finger, that Old Mr. Grace is dictating to her. She only appears in a few episodes at the end of Series 8.\n\nAlthough never being assigned a name, Old Mr. Grace's Secretary (Debbie Linden) is very good-looking. When Old Mr. Grace first meets her, she is described by Mr. Harman as 'one owner since new, very sporty, and capable of high speeds if you put your foot down and she's all yours.' She is blonde, and often wears short skirts, low cut tops and she also has a small purple streak in her hair. She only appeared in five episodes in Series 8, after which Mr. Grace says that she is going off on a course.\n\nMiss Belfridge (Candy Davis) was the longest-running secretary of Mr. Rumbold (lasting all of Series 9 and 10) and her beautiful face and voluptuous figure caught the attentions of most male members of staff (especially Captain Peacock, besides Mr. Rumbold). The busty blonde appeared to be smitten by Captain Peacock, often flirting with him. She appeared in many episodes and was the most prominent of Mr. Rumbold's secretaries. She has an O-Level in Literature, and is known for her flamboyant clothes and hairstyles. She is conscientious of her hair and nails, and is sometimes portrayed as mildly stupid.\n\nMrs Annie Humphries is Mr. Humphries' mother. She only appears twice during the show. The other times that we hear about her is from Mr. Humphries himself or from their telephone calls during and after work. Her marital status is unknown, in early series and in 'Heir Apparent' Mr. Humphries mentions his father, but for most of the show she stays with Mr. Humphries at a shared home, and Mr. Humphries speaks frequently about her, at one point saying 'I wish she'd get married again'. The first time she appears is in the episode \"Founder's Day\", where she explains how Mr. Humphries got his job at Grace Brothers. The second time she appears is in \"Heir apparent\", where Old Mr Grace is thought to be Mr Humphries' father. In this episode, Mr. Humphries' mother does come to Grace Brothers. Her first appearance was a video recording. John Inman was not credited for that episode. In the second episode, however, he was credited as a 'guest appearance'. In this episode the mother and son never cross paths, and one is always looking for the other. Mr. Humphries' mother often tries to make her son more manly. She often enrolls him in things that will 'make him a man'. In the movie, she overhears the female worker, Conchita, asking Mr. Humphries if she can share his bed. She tells him that 'the change will do him good.'\n\nMrs Peacock (Diana King/Diana Lambert) was the long-suffering wife of Captain Peacock. She always suspected Captain Peacock of cheating on her and all her on-screen appearances were during periods of marital discord. In Mrs Peacock's first appearance (\"Oh What A Tangled Web\"), she suspected Captain Peacock of having an affair with Mr Rumbold's secretary, Miss Hazelwood, because her brother had seen them in a car together, although he was later cleared. In her second appearance (\"A Personal Problem\"), because Captain Peacock had accidentally put his hands down Miss Pickthorpe's cleavage to retrieve some spilt blancmange and semolina pudding at a party (the department Miss Pickthorpe works for was never specified, and the semolina pudding turned out to be Mr Harrowgate and Miss Fawcett the year before. Like Miss Pickthorpe, their department was never found out). Mrs Peacock became Mr Rumbold's secretary, and she pretended that she was having an affair with him to make Captain Peacock jealous. In her third appearance (\"The Sweet Smell Of Success\"), Mrs Peacock burst into Mr Rumbold's office because she suspected Captain Peacock of flirting with Mr Rumbold's new secretary, Miss Belfridge. In her fourth appearance (\"Grounds For Divorce\"), Captain Peacock chose to stay with her rather than a bank/accounts clerk who had become infatuated with him. In her fifth appearance (\"Friends And Neighbours\"), Mrs Peacock came to the Grace Brothers houses to check up on her husband (like Mrs Rumbold), but she left satisfied (unlike Mrs Rumbold). Captain Peacock once mentioned that she had many brothers and sisters (\"His And Hers\" and \"The Think Tank\"). By the time of \"Grace and Favour\", Mrs Peacock seems to be either dead or divorced from Captain Peacock as she is neither seen nor mentioned.\n\nMrs. Grainger (Pearl Hackney) was Mr. Grainger's wife. She was mentioned by him, to miss \"Mrs. Dale's Diary\", despite that it had gone off the air over ten years earlier, and to want a world-cruise, when it appeared that Mr. Grainger had won a lot of money. Mrs. Grainger's only appearance was when she came to the store in \"The Clock\", to celebrate Mr. Grainger's 65th birthday. She was frequently mentioned by Mr Grainger throughout the series.\n\nMrs. Rumbold (Jean Challis) was Mr. Rumbold's wife. She was rarely mentioned and only appeared once in the show; that was when she suspected Mr. Rumbold of cheating on her (\"Friends And Neighbours\"), and she stormed into the Grace Brothers flats to see what was going on, and discovered her husband drinking champagne with his secretary, Miss Belfridge. By the time of \"Grace And Favour\", Mrs Rumbold had left her husband for Mr. Prentice of Tools and Hardware.\n\nMycroft is Mr. Rumbold's brother. He is only seen once, and it is implied that he is an artist or family researcher, for he makes a shield for Old Mr. Grace's 90th birthday, to celebrate his roots, which were Welsh, then Scottish, then from Somerset, and then had something to do with the Black and White Minstrels. Unlike his brother, he has a head of flaming red hair, and has thin, metal-rimmed glasses.\n\nplayed by Doremy Vernon\nManageress of the canteen, mostly cooked disgraceful food, and had a large, rubbish-strewn kitchen. She frequently had arguments with the senior staff and wasn't worried about being fired due to her union, 'National Associated Canteen Employees, Restaurant and Domestic' (NACERD, a play on the term knackered). By Series 9, she had developed a friendship with the staff and appeared in the commercial of their night club in Series 10.\n\nAlthough her character was never given a name, the blonde nurse to both Old Mr Grace and Young Mr Grace appeared on the programme for three series. She is mostly recalled for her good looks and particularly for her seductive, husky voice; which was used for effect in the episode \"Closed Circuit\" when Miss Brahms' high-pitched Cockney accent proves to be incompatible as the public face of Grace Brothers' department store. Nurse dubs Miss Brahms' voice, causing a passing by Lord to become smitten with the sound of her. The nurse was generally professional and thorough (apart from her attire), and assisted with most of the medical goings-on at Grace Brothers, even those that didn't involve the brothers themselves. Astley appeared as the character in series 5, while Johnson played the character in most of her appearances.\n\nGoddard (Freddie Wiles), was the early chaffeur to Young Mr Grace. He appeared in many episodes between the pilot and season six. He always appeared in an old-fashioned chauffeur's uniform. Although regularly appearing and escorting Mr Grace around the store, Wiles was never credited for his role. However, Freddie Wiles played a porter in the final episode of season five and was credited.\n\nThis section contains the minor characters in \"Are You Being Served?\"\n\nEven though Hilda Fenemore played one character, (a cleaner), it was assigned three names - Elsie Makepiece, Daphne Ackroyd, and Ivy. She appeared between seasons two and seven, and always has her hair in curlers and wears a turban, except series seven where she wears a white, bright yellow overall. She speaks with a Cockney accent, and is apparently married, although her husband is only mentioned once.\n\nIn one episode she is joined by Gladys, played by Lambert (Cold Comfort).\n\nIn the final episode, the cleaners are played by Mary Bradley and Joan Dainty.\n\nOther (silent and uncredited) cleaners were called Doris Poland, Ivy Plunkett, Hillary, Deirdre, Daphne, Beatrice, Ethel, Betty, Noreen and Mrs Wadonga.\n\nMrs Axelby is the best friend and possibly close neighbour of Mrs Slocombe. She is never seen on screen but Mrs Slocombe mentioned her many times, mostly starting with the line \"Me and my friend Mrs Axelby...\". They would seem to frequent a lot of bars together in search of men. Many episodes begin with Mrs Slocombe relating an anecdote involving her and Mrs Axelby to Miss Brahms. She is described as a tough woman, who plays many contact sports. In an earlier episode, she is referred to as 'Mrs. Elthrop'.\n\nTiddles was the pet cat and longtime feline companion of Mrs Slocombe. Mrs Slocombe refers to Tiddles as her \"pussy\". Mrs. Slocombe clearly loves Tiddles often voicing her dislike for staying behind for a staff meeting, or coming in early, due to inconveniencing Tiddles. It is later revealed that Mrs Slocombe owns a parrot/canary called Winston whom Tiddles does not get on with. In \"Mrs Slocombe Expects\", Mrs Slocombe discovers that Tiddles was pregnant and suspects that the father is a Burmese cat that lives nearby. Later, Mrs Slocombe becomes worried that Tiddles will go into labour when she is not there so decides to ask permission to bring her into work. When Mr Rumbold refuses, Mr Harman smuggles her into the tailor store in a coffee machine and she goes into labour. Tiddles's tail is actually seen coming out of the coffee machine (this was props, not a real cat). Mrs Slocombe is prevented from helping her. The management work out Tiddles is there. When they go in, they find that Tiddles now has six kittens. Captain Peacock and Mr Rumbold's anger are washed away at the sight of the \"cute and enchanting\" kittens. The credits then show each of the staff (apart from Young Mr Grace and Mr Rumbold) holding, smiling and cuddling one of the kittens. (Live kittens were shown briefly in the episode.) In \"The Apartment\", Mrs Slocombe is moving house and but finds she has squatters in her new house, so Mrs Slocombe temporarily moves into the store and makes up a little house and takes Tiddles and Winston with her. Tiddles is actually seen again in her carrier box (once again Tiddles is portrayed by props). In \"Lost And Found\", Tiddles went missing causes great distress for Mrs Slocombe. The staff receive news that one of her toys was found near a well. Fearing the worst, the staff decide to buy her a kitten called Madam Wou whose father was \"Emperor Chong of Bangkok, five times triple champion\". At the end, Tiddles returns with another six kittens and sired by Madam Wou's father. Mrs Slocombe also briefly wins another parrot/canary in the Lottery. In \"The Night Club\", Mrs Slocombe tries to send a telephone message to Tiddles but accidentally sends it to a neighbour, making him think that she fancies him. Tiddles was seen live for the first time in \"Grace and Favour\". In \"Fifty Years On\", it is revealed that Tiddles was born in the late 1960s. Tiddles's appearance keeps changing throughout the series. In \"Mrs Slocombe Expects\", Tiddles appears to be a grey tabby. In \"The Apartment\", Tiddles is a black cat. In Grace and Favour, Tiddles is a blueish-grey Persian cat. Also in Grace and Favour, it is revealed that Mrs Slocombe had a cat before Tiddles, in 1951. Despite having been depicted as having had kittens with male cats (two litters: six in each, making twelve), and being referenced as a female in some episodes, Tiddles was sometimes referred to as a tomcat (male).\n\nDespite only appearing in one episode in series 7 (\"Mrs. Slocombe, Senior Person\"), Miss Edna Comlozi (Avril Angers), is mentioned in several other episodes, and works in the Cosmetics department. In a later episode, it is said she was fired for being rude to a customer. In earlier episodes, she is said to be a friend of Mrs. Slocombe, but in her appearance she is heard to call Mrs. Slocombe a 'silly old bitch'. Mrs. Slocombe's response to this was \"Fancy Cat!\" spoken in a low, resentful tone.\n\nMr Patel (Renu Setna), is the head of the Accounts Department. He only appeared in one series 7 episode, but is mentioned frequently by members of staff. In a later episode, he has resigned due to one of Old Mr. Grace's new rules or schemes. He is from either India or Bangladesh, for he is said to eat curry and chapatis.\n\nThis section contains a list of actors who portrayed customers and others in \"Are You Being Served?\". Many of the same actors portrayed multiple customers throughout the series and the extras cast might therefore be considered an ensemble in its own right. Episode titles are shown followed by character names (where credited) or identifiers/descriptions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The avifauna of the Northern Mariana Islands include a total of 104 species, of which one is endemic, one has been introduced by humans and three are rare or accidental. Five species are globally threatened.\n\nThis list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of \"The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World\", 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for the Northern Mariana Islands.\n\nThe following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The commonly occurring native species do not fall into any of these categories.\n\n\nOrder: ProcellariiformesFamily: Procellariidae\n\nThe procellariids are the main group of medium-sized \"true petrels\", characterized by united nostrils with medium septum and a long outer functional primary. \n\n\nOrder: ProcellariiformesFamily: Hydrobatidae\n\nThe northern storm petrels are relatives of the petrels and are the smallest seabirds. They feed on planktonic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. The flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like.\n\n\nOrder: PhaethontiformesFamily: Phaethontidae\n\nTropicbirds are slender white birds of tropical oceans, with exceptionally long central tail feathers. Their heads and long wings have black markings.\n\n\nOrder: SuliformesFamily: Sulidae\n\nThe sulids comprise the gannets and boobies. Both groups are medium to large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish.\n\n\nOrder: SuliformesFamily: Phalacrocoracidae\n\nPhalacrocoracidae is a family of medium to large coastal, fish-eating seabirds that includes cormorants and shags. Plumage coloration varies, with the majority having mainly dark plumage, some species being black-and-white and a few being colorful. \n\n\nOrder: SuliformesFamily: Fregatidae\n\nFrigatebirds are large seabirds usually found over tropical oceans. They are large, black and white or completely black, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have colored inflatable throat pouches.

{"id": "525098", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=525098", "title": "Monument", "text": "Monument\n\nA monument is a type of—usually three-dimensional—structure that was explicitly created to commemorate a person or event, or which has become relevant to a social group as a part of their remembrance of historic times or cultural heritage, due to its artistic, historical, political, technical or architectural importance. Examples of monuments include statues, (war) memorials, historical buildings, archeological sites, and cultural assets. If there is a public interest in its preservation, a monument can for example be listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. \n\nThe origin of the word \"monument\" comes from the Greek \"mnemosynon\" and the Latin \"moneo\", \"monere\", which means 'to remind', 'to advise' or 'to warn', suggesting a monument allows us to see the past thus helping us visualize what is to come in the future. In English the word \"monumental\" is often used in reference to something of extraordinary size and power, as in monumental sculpture, but also to mean simply anything made to commemorate the dead, as a funerary monument or other example of funerary art.\n\nMonuments have been created for thousands of years, and they are often the most durable and famous symbols of ancient civilizations. Prehistoric tumuli, dolmens, and similar structures have been created in a large number of prehistoric cultures across the world, and the many forms of monumental tombs of the more wealthy and powerful members of a society are often the source of much of our information and art from those cultures. As societies became organized on a larger scale, so monuments so large as to be difficult to destroy like the Egyptian Pyramids, the Greek Parthenon, the Great Wall of China, Indian Taj Mahal or the Moai of Easter Island have become symbols of their civilizations. In more recent times, monumental structures such as the Statue of Liberty and Eiffel Tower have become iconic emblems of modern nation-states. The term \"monumentality\" relates to the symbolic status and physical presence of a monument. In this context, German art historian Helmut Scharf states that “A monument exists in the form of an object and also as symbol thereof. As a language symbol, a monument usually refers to something concrete, in some rare cases it is also used metaphorically [...]. A monument can be a language symbol for a unity of several monuments [...] or only for a single one, but in a broader sense it can also be used in nearly all knowable planes of being. [...] What is considered a monument always depends on the importance it attributes to the prevailing or traditional consciousness of a specific historical and social situation.”\n\nBasically, the definition framework of the term monument depends on the current historical frame conditions. Aspects of the Culture of Remembrance and cultural memory are also linked to it, as well as questions about the concepts of public sphere and durability (of the one memorized) and the form and content of the monument (work-like monument). From an art historical point of view, the dichotomy of content and form opens up the problem of the “linguistic ability” of the monument. It becomes clear that language is an eminent part of a monument and it is often represented in “non-objective” or “architectural monuments”, at least with a plaque. In this connection, the debate touches on the social mechanisms that combine with Remembrance. These are acceptance of the monument as an object, the conveyed contents and the impact of these contents.\n\nMonuments are frequently used to improve the appearance of a city or location. Planned cities such as Washington D.C., New Delhi and Brasília are often built around monuments. For example, the Washington Monument's location was conceived by L'Enfant to help organize public space in the city, before it was designed or constructed. Older cities have monuments placed at locations that are already important or are sometimes redesigned to focus on one. As Shelley suggested in his famous poem \"Ozymandias\" (\"Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!\"), the purpose of monuments is very often to impress or awe.\n\nStructures created for others purposes that have been made notable by their age, size or historic significance may also be regarded as monuments. This can happen because of great age and size, as in the case of the Great Wall of China, or because an event of great importance occurred there such as the village of Oradour-sur-Glane in France. Many countries use Ancient monument or similar terms for the official designation of protected structures or archeological sites which may originally have been ordinary domestic houses or other buildings.\n\nMonuments are also often designed to convey historical or political information, and they can thus develop an active socio-political potency. They can be used to reinforce the primacy of contemporary political power, such as the column of Trajan or the numerous statues of Lenin in the Soviet Union. They can be used to educate the populace about important events or figures from the past, such as in the renaming of the old General Post Office Building in New York City to the James A. Farley Building (James Farley Post Office), after former Postmaster General James Farley. To fulfill its informative and educative functions a monument needs to be open to the public, which means that its spatial dimension as well as its content can be experienced by the public, and be sustainable. The former may be achieved either by situating the monument in public space or by a public discussion about the it and its meaning, the latter by the materiality of the monument or if its content immediately becomes part of the collective or cultural memory.\n\nThe social meanings of monuments are rarely fixed and certain and are frequently 'contested' by different social groups. As an example: whilst the former East German socialist state may have seen the Berlin Wall as a means of 'protection' from the ideological impurity of the west, dissidents and others would often argue that it was symbolic of the inherent repression and paranoia of that state. This contention of meaning is a central theme of modern 'post processual' archaeological discourse.\n\nThe term is often used to describe any structure that is a significant and legally protected historic work, and many countries have equivalents of what is called in United Kingdom legislation a Scheduled Monument, which often include relatively recent buildings constructed for residential or industrial purposes, with no thought at the time that they would come to be regarded as \"monuments\".\n\nUntil recently, it was customary for archaeologists to study large monuments and pay less attention to the everyday lives of the societies that created them. New ideas about what constitutes the archaeological record have revealed that certain legislative and theoretical approaches to the subject are too focused on earlier definitions of monuments. An example has been the United Kingdom's Scheduled Ancient Monument laws.\n\nOther than municipal or national government that protecting the monuments in their jurisdiction, there are institutions dedicated on the efforts to protect and preserve monuments that considered to possess special natural or cultural significance for the world, such as UNESCO's World Heritage Site programme and World Monuments Fund.\n\nRecently, more and more monuments are being preserved digitally (in 3D models) through organisations as CyArk.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is situated on a hill overlooking the city of Beersheba from the east and constitutes a recognized symbol of the Negev and Beersheba. In addition to its strengths as a memorial, it was a precursor to the land art movement.\n\nThe monument was built between 1963 and 1968 at a time when Israel was making many physical memorials to those who fought and died in its wars. It is made of raw concrete consisting of eighteen separate elements covering 10,000 square meters. These elements are symbolic and connected to Palmach and to the War of Independence.\n\nThe perforated tower alludes to a watchtower shelled with gunfire and the pipeline tunnel is reminiscent of the channel of water in the Negev defended by the soldiers. Engraved in the concrete are the names of the 324 soldiers who died in the war, the badge of the Palmach, diary passages from the soldiers, the battle registry, verses (from the Bible 2 Kings 2:12) and songs.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "159461", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=159461", "title": "Mount Kilimanjaro", "text": "Mount Kilimanjaro\n\nMount Kilimanjaro or just Kilimanjaro (), with its three volcanic cones, \"Kibo\", \"Mawenzi\", and \"Shira\", is a dormant volcano in Tanzania. It is the highest mountain in Africa, about from its base, and above sea level. The first people known to have reached the summit of the mountain were Hans Meyer and Ludwig Purtscheller in 1889. The mountain is part of the Kilimanjaro National Park and is a major climbing destination. The mountain has been the subject of many scientific studies because of its shrinking glaciers and disappearing ice fields.\n\nKilimanjaro is a large stratovolcano and is composed of three distinct volcanic cones: Kibo, the highest; Mawenzi at ; and Shira, the shortest at . Mawenzi and Shira are extinct, while Kibo is dormant and could erupt again.\n\nUhuru Peak is the highest summit on Kibo's crater rim. The Tanzania National Parks Authority, a Tanzanian governmental agency, and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization list the height of Uhuru Peak as . That height is based on a British Ordnance Survey in 1952. Since then, the height has been measured as in 1999, in 2008, and in 2014.\n\nThe interior of the volcanic edifice is poorly known, given the lack of large scale erosion that could have exposed the interiors of the volcano.\n\nEruptive activity at the Shira centre commenced about 2.5 million years ago, with the last important phase occurring about 1.9 million years ago, just before the northern part of the edifice collapsed. Shira is topped by a broad plateau at , which may be a filled caldera. The remnant caldera rim has been degraded deeply by erosion. Before the caldera formed and erosion began, Shira might have been between 4,900 m (16,000 ft) and 5,200 m (17,000 ft) high. It is mostly composed of basic lavas with some pyroclastics. The formation of the caldera was accompanied by lava emanating from ring fractures, but there was no large scale explosive activity. Two cones formed subsequently, the phonolitic one at the northwest end of the ridge and the doleritic \"Platzkegel\" in the caldera centre.\n\nBoth Mawenzi and Kibo began erupting about 1 million years ago. They are separated by the \"Saddle Plateau\" at elevation.\nThe youngest dated rocks at Mawenzi are about 448,000 years old. Mawenzi forms a horseshoe shaped ridge with pinnacles and ridges opening to the northeast that has a tower-like shape resulting from deep erosion and a mafic dyke swarm. Several large cirques cut into the ring, the largest of these sits on top of the Great Barranco gorge. Also notable are the Ost and West Barrancos on the northeastern side of the mountain. Most of the eastern side of the mountain has been removed by erosion. Mawenzi has a subsidiary peak named Neumann Tower, .\n\nKibo is the largest cone and is more than wide at the \"Saddle Plateau\" altitude. The last activity here has been dated to between 150,000 and 200,000 years ago and created the current Kibo summit crater. Kibo still has gas-emitting fumaroles in the crater. Kibo is capped by an almost symmetrical cone with escarpments rising to on the south side. These escarpments define a caldera caused by the collapse of the summit. Within this caldera is the Inner Cone and within the crater of the Inner Cone is the Reusch Crater, which the Tanganyika government in 1954 named after Gustav Otto Richard Reusch upon his climbing the mountain for the 25th time (out of 65 attempts during his lifetime). The Ash Pit, deep, lies within the Reusch Crater. About 100,000 years ago, part of Kibo's crater rim collapsed, creating the area known as the Western Breach and the Great Barranco.\n\nAn almost continuous layer of lava buries most older geological features, with the exception of exposed strata within the Great West Notch and the Kibo Barranco. The former exposes intrusions of syenite. Kibo has five main lava formations:\n\nKibo has more than 250 parasitic cones on its northwest and southeast flanks that were formed between 150,000 and 200,000 years ago and erupted picrobasalts, trachybasalts, ankaramites, and basanites. They reach as far as Lake Chala and Taveta in the southeast and the Lengurumani Plain in the northwest. Most of these cones are well preserved, with the exception of the Saddle Plateau cones that were heavily affected by glacial action. Despite their mostly small size, lava from the cones has obscured large portions of the mountain. The Saddle Plateau cones are mostly cinder cones with terminal effusion of lava, while the Upper Rombo Zone cones mostly generated lava flows. All Saddle Plateau cones predate the last glaciation.\n\nAccording to reports gathered in the 19th century from the Maasai, Lake Chala on Kibo's eastern flank was the site of a village that was destroyed by an eruption.\n\nThe mountain is drained by a network of rivers and streams, especially on the wetter and more heavily eroded southern side and especially above . Below that altitude, increased evaporation and human water usage reduces the waterflows. The Lumi and Pangani rivers drain Kilimanjaro on the eastern and southern sides, respectively.\n\nThe origin of the name \"Kilimanjaro\" is not precisely known, but a number of theories exist. European explorers had adopted the name by 1860 and reported that \"Kilimanjaro\" was the mountain's Kiswahili name. The 1907 edition of \"The Nuttall Encyclopædia\" also records the name of the mountain as \"Kilima-Njaro\".\n\nJohann Ludwig Krapf wrote in 1860 that Swahilis along the coast called the mountain \"Kilimanjaro\". Although he did not support his claim, he claimed that \"Kilimanjaro\" meant either \"mountain of greatness\" or \"mountain of caravans\". Under the latter meaning, \"Kilima\" meant \"mountain\" and \"Jaro\" possibly meant \"caravans\".\n\nJim Thompson claimed in 1885, although he also did not support his claim, that the term Kilima-Njaro \"has generally been understood to mean\" the Mountain (Kilima) of Greatness (Njaro). \"Though not improbably it may mean\" the \"White\" mountain.\n\n\"Njaro\" is an ancient Kiswahili word for \"shining\". Similarly, Krapf wrote that a chief of the Wakamba people, whom he visited in 1849, \"had been to Jagga and had seen the Kima jaJeu, mountain of whiteness, the name given by the Wakamba to Kilimanjaro...\" More correctly in the Kikamba language, this would be Kiima Kyeu, and this possible derivation has been popular with several investigators.\n\nOthers have assumed that \"Kilima\" is Kiswahili for \"mountain\". The problem with this assumption is that \"Kilima\" actually means \"hill\" and is, therefore, the diminutive of \"Mlima\", the proper Kiswahili word for mountain. However, \"[i]t is ... possible ... that an early European visitor, whose knowledge of [Kiswahili] was not extensive, changed mlima to kilima by analogy with the two Wachagga names; Kibo and Kimawenzi.\"\n\nA different approach is to assume that the \"Kileman\" part of Kilimanjaro comes from the Kichagga \"kileme\", which means \"which defeats\", or \"kilelema\", which means \"which has become difficult or impossible\". The \"Jaro\" part would \"then be derived from njaare, a bird, or, according to other informants, a leopard, or, possibly from jyaro a caravan.\" Considering that the name Kilimanjaro has never been current among the Wachagga people, it is possible that the name was derived from Wachagga saying that the mountain was unclimbable, \"kilemanjaare\" or \"kilemajyaro\" and porters misinterpreted this as being the name of the mountain.\n\nIn the 1880s, the mountain became a part of German East Africa and was called \"Kilima-Ndscharo\" in German following the Kiswahili name components.\n\nOn 6 October 1889, Hans Meyer reached the highest summit on the crater ridge of Kibo. He named it \"Kaiser-Wilhelm-Spitze\" (\"Kaiser Wilhelm peak\"). That name apparently was used until Tanzania was formed in 1964, when the summit was renamed \"Uhuru Peak\", meaning \"Freedom Peak\" in Kiswahili.\n\nThe mountain may have been known to non-Africans since antiquity. Sailors' reports recorded by Ptolemy mention a \"Moon Mountain\" and a spring lake of the Nile, which may indicate Kilimanjaro; although available historical information does not allow differentiation among Mount Kenya, the mountains of Ethiopia, the Virunga Mountains, Kilimanjaro, and the Rwenzori Mountains. Before Ptolemy, Aeschylus and Herodotus referred to \"Egypt nurtured by the snows\" and a spring between two mountains, respectively. One of these mentions two tall mountains in the coastal regions with a valley with traces of fire in between. Martín Fernández de Enciso, a Spanish traveller to Mombasa who obtained information about the interior from native caravans, said in his \"Summa de Geografía\" (1519) that west of Mombasa \"stands the Ethiopian Mount Olympus, which is exceedingly high, and beyond it are the Mountains of the Moon, in which are the sources of the Nile\".\n\nThe German missionaries Johannes Rebmann of Mombasa and Krapf were the first Europeans to try to reach the snowy mountain. According to English geographer Halford Mackinder and English explorer Harry Johnston, Rebmann in 1848 was the first European to report the existence of Kilimanjaro. Hans Meyer has claimed that Rebmann first arrived in Africa in 1846 and has quoted Rebmann's diary entry of 11 May 1848 as saying, \"This morning, at 10 o'clock, we obtained a clearer view of the mountains of Jagga, the summit of one of which was covered by what looked like a beautiful white cloud. When I inquired as to the dazzling whiteness, the guide merely called it 'cold' and at once I knew it could be neither more nor less than snow... Immediately I understood how to interpret the marvelous tales Dr. Krapf and I had heard at the coast, of a vast mountain of gold and silver in the far interior, the approach to which was guarded by evil spirits.\" In light of these sources, J. Shearson Hyland's assertion that Rebmann first saw the mountain in 1840 appears to be erroneous.\n\nIn August 1861, the Prussian officer Baron Karl Klaus von der Decken accompanied by English geologist R. Thornton made a first attempt to climb Kibo but \"got no farther than owing to the inclemency of the weather.\" In December 1862, von der Decken tried a second time together with Otto Kersten. They reached a height of .\n\nIn August 1871, missionary Charles New became the \"first European to reach the equatorial snows\" on Kilimanjaro at an elevation of slightly more than .\n\nIn June 1887, the Hungarian Count Sámuel Teleki and Austrian Lieutenant Ludwig von Höhnel made an attempt to climb the mountain. Approaching from the saddle between Mawenzi and Kibo, Höhnel stopped at , but Teleki pushed through until he reached the snow at .\n\nLater in 1887 during his first attempt to climb Kilimanjaro, the German geology professor Hans Meyer reached the lower edge of the ice cap on Kibo, where he was forced to turn back because he lacked the equipment needed to handle the ice. The following year, Meyer planned another attempt with Oscar Baumann, a cartographer, but the mission was aborted after the pair were held hostage and ransomed during the Abushiri Revolt.\n\nIn the autumn of 1888, the American naturalist Dr. Abbott and the German explorer Otto Ehrenfried Ehlers approached the summit from the northwest. While Abbott turned back earlier, Ehlers at first claimed to have reached the summit rim but, after severe criticism of that claim, later withdrew it.\n\nIn 1889, Meyer returned to Kilimanjaro with the Austrian mountaineer Ludwig Purtscheller for a third attempt. The success of this attempt was based on the establishment of several campsites with food supplies so that multiple attempts at the top could be made without having to descend too far. Meyer and Purtscheller pushed to near the crater rim on October 3 but turned around exhausted from hacking footsteps in the icy slope. Three days later, on Purtscheller's fortieth birthday, they reached the highest summit on the southern rim of the crater. They were the first to confirm that Kibo has a crater. After descending to the saddle between Kibo and Mawenzi, Meyer and Purtscheller attempted to climb the more technically challenging Mawenzi but could reach only the top of Klute Peak, a subsidiary peak, before retreating due to illness. On October 18, they reascended Kibo to enter and study the crater, cresting the rim at Hans Meyers Notch. In total, Meyer and Purtscheller spent 16 days above during their expedition. They were accompanied in their high camps by Mwini Amani of Pangani, who cooked and supplied the sites with water and firewood.\n\nThe first ascent of the highest summit of Mawenzi was made on 29 July 1912, by the German climbers Eduard Hans Oehler and Fritz Klute, who named it Hans Meyer Peak. Oehler and Klute went on to make the third-ever ascent of Kibo, via the Drygalski Glacier, and descended via the Western Breach.\n\nIn 1989, the organizing committee of the 100-year celebration of the first ascent decided to award posthumous certificates to the African porter-guides who had accompanied Meyer and Purtscheller. One person in pictures or documents of the 1889 expedition was thought to match a living inhabitant of Marangu, Yohani Kinyala Lauwo. Lauwo did not know his own age. Nor did he remember Meyer or Purtscheller, but he remembered joining a Kilimanjaro expedition involving a Dutch doctor who lived near the mountain and that he did not get to wear shoes during the climb. Lauwo claimed that he had climbed the mountain three times before the beginning of World War I. The committee concluded that he had been a member of Meyer's team and therefore must have been born around 1871. Lauwo died on 10 May 1996, 107 years after the first ascent, but now is sometimes even suggested as co-first-ascendant of Kilimanjaro. However, this would imply he lived to the age of 125 years, so the claim appears unlikely\n\nThe fastest ascent-descent has been recorded by the Swiss-Ecuadorian mountain guide Karl Egloff (born 16 March 1981 in Quito), who ran to the top and back in 6 hours and 42 minutes on 13 August 2014. Previous records were held by Spanish mountain runner Kílian Jornet (7 hours, 14 minutes on 29 September 2010) and by Tanzanian guide Simon Mtuy (9 hours, 21 minutes on 22 February 2006).\n\nThe female ascent record is held by Anne-Marie Flammersfeld. On 27 July 2015, she climbed to the summit in 8 hours, 32 minutes via the Umbwe Route, which is about long. Born in Germany but living in Switzerland, she broke the record of Britain's Becky Shuttleworth who climbed to the summit in 11 hours, 34 minutes on 20 September 2014.\n\nFlammersfeld then needed 4 hours, 26 minutes to run down to the Mweka Gate, for a combined ascent and descent time of 12 hours, 58 minutes. That broke the previous record of 18 hours, 31 minutes held by Debbie Bachman.\n\nDespite an age-limit of 10 years for a climbing permit, exceptions are occasionally granted. Montannah Kenney, a 7-year-old girl from Texas broke the world record as the youngest female to climb the tallest mountain in Africa in March 2018. Her motivation was the death of her late father.\n\nAlso, Keats Boyd of Los Angeles was only seven years old when he summited Kilimanjaro on 21 January 2008. The oldest person to reach Uhuru Peak was Angela Vorobeva at age 86 years and 267 days. The oldest man to summit the mountain is American Robert Wheeler, who was 85 years and 201 days when he summited on 2 October 2014.\n\nWheelchair user Bernard Goosen scaled Kilimanjaro in six days in 2007, while in 2012 Kyle Maynard, who has no forearms or lower legs, crawled unassisted to the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro.\n\nKilimanjaro National Park generated US $51 million in revenue in 2013, the second-most of any Tanzanian national park. (The Ngorongoro Conservation Area, which includes the heavily visited Ngorongoro Crater, is not a national park.) The Tanzania National Parks Authority reported that the park recorded 57,456 tourists during the 2011–12 budget year, of whom 16,425 hiked the mountain, which was well below the capacity of 28,470 as specified in the park's General Management Plan. The mountain climbers generated irregular and seasonal jobs for about 11,000 guides, porters, and cooks in 2007, although serious concerns have been raised about their poor working conditions and inadequate wages.\n\nThere are seven official trekking routes by which to ascend and descend Kilimanjaro: Lemosho, Machame, Marangu, Mweka, Rongai, Shira, and Umbwe. Of all the routes, Machame is widely proclaimed as the most scenic, albeit steeper, route. This was true until the opening of Lemosho and Northern Circuit routes, which are equally scenic if not more. The Machame route can be done in six or seven days, Lemosho can be done in six to eight days, and the Northern Circuit routes can be done in seven or more days. The Rongai is the easiest and least scenic of all camping routes. The Marangu is also relatively easy, but this route tends to be very busy, the ascent and descent routes are the same, and accommodation is in shared huts with all other climbers.\n\nPeople who wish to trek to the summit of Kilimanjaro are advised to undertake appropriate research and ensure that they are both properly equipped and physically capable. Though the climb is technically not as challenging as when climbing the high peaks of the Himalayas or Andes, the high elevation, low temperature, and occasional high winds make this a difficult and dangerous trek. Acclimatization is essential, and even the most experienced trekkers suffer some degree of altitude sickness.\n\nA small study of people attempting to reach the summit of Kilimanjaro in July and August 2005 found that 61.3 percent succeeded and 77 percent experienced acute mountain sickness (AMS). A retrospective study of 917 persons who attempted to reach the summit via the Lemosho or Machame routes found that 70.4 percent experienced AMS, defined in this study to be headache, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, or loss of appetite.\n\nKilimanjaro's summit is well above the altitude at which life-threatening high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) or high altitude cerebral edema (HACE), the most severe forms of AMS, can occur. These health risks are increased substantially by excessively fast climbing schedules motivated by high daily national park fees, busy holiday travel schedules, and the lack of permanent shelter on most routes.\n\nA daily dose of 250 milligrams of acetazolamide is associated with a 48 percent relative-risk reduction of AMS compared to placebo, with a higher dose not providing additional protection but causing more adverse side effects. The six-day Machame route, which involves one night of \"sleeping low\", may delay the onset of AMS but does not ultimately prevent its occurrence.\n\nFalls on steep portions of the mountain and rock slides have killed trekkers. For this reason, the route via the Arrow Glacier was closed for several years, reopening in December 2007.\n\nDue to the improper disposal of human waste in the mountain environment there is high risk of health hazards. Human faeces are very dangerous; they contain over 100 bacteria, protozoans and viruses that, without a specialised recycling process, pose a threat to both animals and human beings. Only boiled or chemically treated water is accepted for drinking. Decent changes have appeared in recent years–management bodies care more about human waste disposal. The authorities in mountain regions are gradually exchanging the old, leaking toilets for newer, eco–friendly models.\n\nAccording to the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre in Moshi, 25 people died from January 1996 to October 2003 while climbing the mountain. Seventeen were female and eight were male, ranging in age from 29 to 74. Fourteen died from advanced high altitude illness, including one with HACE, five with HAPE, and six with both HACE and HAPE. The remaining eleven deaths resulted from trauma (three), myocardial infarction (four), pneumonia (two), cardio-pulmonary failure of other underlying cause (one), and acute appendicitis (one). The overall mortality rate was an estimated 13.6 per 100,000 climbers (0.0136 percent).\n\nA map of the Kibo cone on Mount Kilimanjaro was published by the British government's Directorate of Overseas Surveys in 1964 based on aerial photography conducted in 1962 (Subset of Kilimanjaro, East Africa (Tanganyika) Series Y742, Sheet 56/2, D.O.S. 422 1964, Edition 1, Scale 1:50,000).\n\nTourist mapping was first published by the Ordnance Survey in England in 1989 based on the original DOS mapping (1:100,000, 100 ft intervals, DOS 522). West Col Productions produced a map with tourist information in 1990 (1:75,000, 100 metre contour intervals, inset maps of Kibo and Mawenzi on 1:20,000 and 1:30,000 scales respectively and 50 metre contour interval). In the last few years, numerous other maps have become available of various qualities.\n\nNatural forests cover about on Kilimanjaro. In the foothill area maize, beans, and sunflowers (on the western side also wheat) are cultivated. Remnants of the former savanna vegetation with \"Acacia\", \"Combretum\", \"Terminalia\" and \"Grewia\" also occur. Between and , coffee also appears as part of the \"Chagga home gardens\" agroforestry. Native vegetation at this altitude range (\"Strombosia\", \"Newtonia\", and \"Entandrophragma\") is limited to inaccessible valleys and gorges and is completely different from vegetation at higher altitudes. On the southern slope montane forests first contain \"Ocotea usambarensis\" as well as ferns and epiphytes, farther up in cloud forests \"Podocarpus latifolius\", \"Hagenia abyssinica\" and \"Erica excelsa\" grow as well as fog-dependent mosses. On the drier northern slopes olive, \"Croton\"-\"Calodendrum\", \"Cassipourea\", and \"Juniperus\" form forests in order of increasing altitude. Between and lie \"Erica\" bush and heathlands, followed by \"Helichrysum\" until . Neophytes have been observed, including \"Poa annua\".\n\nRecords from the Maundi crater at indicate that the vegetation of Kilimanjaro has varied over time. Forest vegetation retreated during the Last Glacial Maximum and the ericaceous vegetation belt lowered by between 42,000 and 30,000 years ago because of the drier and colder conditions.\n\nThe Tussock Grassland is an area on the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro that contains many unique species of vegetation like the water holding cabbage.\n\nLarge animals are rare on Kilimanjaro and are more frequent in the forests and lower parts of the mountain. Elephants and Cape buffaloes are among the animals that can be potentially hazardous to trekkers. Bushbucks, chameleons, dik-diks, duikers, mongooses, sunbirds, and warthogs have been reported as well. Zebras and hyenas have sporadically been observed on the Shira plateau.\n\nSpecific species associated with the mountain include the Kilimanjaro shrew and the chameleon \"Kinyongia tavetana\".\n\nThe climate of Kilimanjaro is influenced by the height of the mountain, which allows the simultaneous influence of the equatorial trade winds and the high altitude anti-trades, and the isolated position of the mountain. Kilimanjaro has daily upslope and nightly downslope winds, a regimen stronger on the southern than the northern side of the mountain. The flatter southern flanks are more extended and affect the atmosphere more strongly.\n\nKilimanjaro has two distinct rainy seasons, one from March to May and another around November. The northern slopes receive much less rainfall than the southern ones. The lower southern slope receives annually, rising to at altitude and peaking \"partly over\" in the forest belt at . In the alpine zone, annual precipitation decreases to .\n\nThe average temperature in the summit area is approximately . Nighttime surface temperatures on the Northern Ice Field (NIF) fall on average to with an average daytime high temperature of . During nights of extreme radiational cooling, the NIF can cool to as low as .\n\nSnowfall can occur any time of year but is associated mostly with northern Tanzania's two rainy seasons (November–December and March–May). Precipitation in the summit area occurs principally as snow and graupel ( per year) and ablates within days or years.\n\n\nKibo's diminishing ice cap exists because Kilimanjaro is a little-dissected, massive mountain that rises above the snow line. The cap is divergent and outwards splits up into individual glaciers. The central portion of the ice cap is interrupted by the presence of the Kibo crater. The summit glaciers and ice fields do not display significant horizontal movements because their low thickness precludes major deformation.\n\nGeological evidence shows five successive glacial episodes during the Quaternary period, namely First (500,000 BP), Second (greater than 360,000 years ago to 240,000 BP), Third (150,000 to 120,000 BP), Fourth (also known as \"Main\") (20,000 to 17,000 BP), and Little (16,000 to 14,000 BP). The Third may have been the most extensive, and the Little appears to be statistically indistinguishable from the Fourth.\n\nA continuous ice cap covering approximately down to an elevation of covered Kilimanjaro during the Last Glacial Maximum in the Pleistocene epoch (the Main glacial episode), extending across the summits of Kibo and Mawenzi. Because of the exceptionally prolonged dry conditions during the subsequent Younger Dryas stadial, the ice fields on Kilimanjaro may have become extinct 11,500 years BP. Ice cores taken from Kilimanjaro's Northern Ice Field (NIF) indicates that the glaciers there have a \"basal age\" of about 11,700 years, although an analysis of ice taken in 2011 from exposed vertical cliffs in the NIF supports an age extending only to 800 years BP.\n\nHigher precipitation rates at the beginning of the Holocene epoch (11,500 years BP) allowed the ice cap to reform. The glaciers survived a widespread drought during a three century period beginning around 4,000 years BP.\nIn the late 1880s, the summit of Kibo was completely covered by an ice cap covering about with outlet glaciers cascading down the western and southern slopes, and except for the inner cone, the entire caldera was buried. Glacier ice also flowed through the Western Breach.\n\nThe slope glaciers retreated rapidly between 1912 and 1953, in response to a sudden shift in climate at the end of the 19th century that made them \"drastically out of equilibrium\", and more slowly thereafter. Their continuing demise indicates they are still out of equilibrium in response to a constant change in climate over the last 100 years.\n\nIn contrast to the persistent slope glaciers, the glaciers on Kilimanjaro's crater plateau have appeared and disappeared repeatedly during the Holocene epoch, with each cycle lasting a few hundred years. It appears that decreasing specific humidity instead of temperature changes has caused the shrinkage of the slope glaciers since the late 19th century. No clear warming trend at the elevation of those glaciers occurred between 1948 and 2005. Although air temperatures at that elevation are always below freezing, solar radiation causes melting on their vertical faces. \"There is no pathway for the plateau glaciers other than to continuously retreat once their vertical margins are exposed to solar radiation.\" Vertical ice margin walls are a unique characteristic of the summit glaciers and a major place of the shrinkage of the glaciers. They manifest stratifications, calving, and other ice features.\nAlmost 85 percent of the ice cover on Kilimanjaro disappeared from October 1912 to June 2011, with coverage decreasing from to . From 1912 to 1953, there was about a 1.1 percent average annual loss. The average annual loss for 1953 to 1989 was 1.4 percent while the loss rate for 1989 to 2007 was 2.5 percent. Of the ice cover still present in 2000, almost 40 percent had disappeared by 2011. The glaciers are thinning in addition to losing areal coverage, and do not have active accumulation zones with retreat occurring on all glacier surfaces. Loss of glacier mass is caused by both melting and sublimation. While the current shrinking and thinning of Kilimanjaro's ice fields appears to be unique within its almost twelve millennium history, it is contemporaneous with widespread glacier retreat in mid-to-low latitudes across the globe. At the current rate, most of the ice on Kilimanjaro will disappear by 2040 and \"it is highly unlikely that any ice body will remain after 2060\".\n\nA complete disappearance of the ice would be of only \"negligible importance\" to the water budget of the area around the mountain. The forests of Kilimanjaro, far below the ice fields, \"are [the] essential water reservoirs for the local and regional populations\".\n\nThe Kilimanjaro glaciers have been used for deriving ice core records, including two from the southern icefield. Based on this data, this icefield formed between 1,250 and 1,450 years BP.\n\nLocal legends by the Chagga people tell how a man named Tone once provoked a god, Ruwa, to bring famine upon the land. The people became angry at Tone, forcing him to flee. Nobody wanted to protect him but a solitary dweller who had stones that turned miraculously into cattle. The dweller bid that Tone never open the stable of the cattle. When Tone did not heed the warning and the cattle escaped, Tone followed them, but the fleeing cattle threw up hills to run on, including Mawenzi and Kibo. Tone finally collapsed on Kibo, ending the pursuit.\n\nAnother legend has it that Kibo and Mawenzi were good neighbours, until Mawenzi played a prank on Kibo and threw away embers he had received from Kibo and claimed that they had burned out. Kibo eventually got angry and beat Mawenzi badly, explaining why the mountain is so badly degraded. This theory explains Mawenzi's name as \"the Battered\".\n\nOther legends tell of ivory-filled graves of elephants on the mountain, and of a cow named Rayli that produces miraculous fat from her tail glands. If a man tries to steal such a gland but is too slow in his moves, Rayli will blast a powerful snort and blow the thief hurling down into the plain.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1867895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1867895", "title": "Multispectral image", "text": "Multispectral image\n\nA multispectral image is one that captures image data within specific wavelength ranges across the electromagnetic spectrum. The wavelengths may be separated by filters or by the use of instruments that are sensitive to particular wavelengths, including light from frequencies beyond the visible light range, i.e. infrared and ultra-violet. Spectral imaging can allow extraction of additional information the human eye fails to capture with its receptors for red, green and blue. It was originally developed for space-based imaging, and has also found use in document and painting analysis.\n\nMultispectral imaging measures light in a small number (typically 3 to 15) of spectral bands. Hyperspectral imaging is a special case of spectral imaging where often hundreds of contiguous spectral bands are available.\n\nIn 2003, researchers at the United States Army Research Laboratory and the Federal Laboratory Collaborative Technology Alliance reported a dual band multispectral imaging focal plane array (FPA) was reported. This FPA allows researchers to look at two infrared (IR) planes at the same time. Multispectral imaging measures light emission and is often used in detecting or tracking military targets. Because mid wave infrared (MWIR) and long wave infrared (LWIR) technologies measure radiation inherent to the object and require no external light source, they also are referred to as thermal imaging methods. \n\nThe brightness of the image produced by a thermal imager depends on the objects emissivity and temperature.  Every material has a infrared signature that aids the identification of the object. These signatures are less pronounced in hyperspectral systems, which work similarly to multispectral but use more bands, when exposed to wind and, more dramatically, to rain. Sometimes the surface of the target may reflect infrared energy. This reflection may misconstrue the true reading of the objects’ inherent radiation. Imaging systems that use MWIR technology function better with solar reflections on the target’s surface and produce more definitive images of hot objects, such as engines, compared to LWIR technology. However, LWIR operates better in hazy environments like smoke or fog because less scattering occurs in the longer wavelengths. The researchers claimed that dual band technologies combine these advantages to improve imaging particularly in the realm of target tracking.\n\nFor nighttime target detection, thermal imaging outperformed single band multispectral imaging. Citation. Dual band MWIR and LWIR technology resulted in better visualization during the nighttime than MWIR alone. Citation Citation. The US Army reports that its dual band LWIR/MWIR FPA demonstrated better visualizing of tactical vehicles than MWIR alone after tracking them through both day and night.  \n\nBy analyzing the emissivity of ground surfaces, multispectral imaging can detect the presence of underground missiles. Surface and sub-surface soil possess different physical and chemical properties that appear in spectral analysis. Disturbed soil has increased emissivity in the wavelength range of 8.5 to 9.5 micrometers while demonstrating no change in wavelengths greater than 10 micrometers. The US Army Research Laboratory’s dual MWIR/LWIR FPA used “red” and “blue” detectors to search for areas with enhanced emissivity. The “red” detector acts as a backdrop, verifying realms of undisturbed soil areas, as it is sensitive to the 10.4 micrometer wavelength. The “blue” detector is sensitive to wavelengths of 9.3 micrometers. If the intensity of the blue image changes when scanning, that region is likely disturbed\".\" The scientists reported that fusing these two images increased detection capabilities. \n\nIntercepting an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) while it is in its boost phase requires imaging of the hard body as well as the rocket plumes. MWIR presents a strong signal for highly heated objected including rocket plumes, while LWIR demonstrates emissions for the missile’s material. The US Army Research Laboratory reported that with their dual band MWIR/LWIR technology, tracking of the Atlas 5 Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicles, similar in design to ICBMs, picked up both the missile body and plumage.\n\nMost radiometers for remote sensing (RS) acquire multispectral images. Dividing the spectrum into many bands, multispectral is the opposite of panchromatic, which records only the total intensity of radiation falling on each pixel. Usually, Earth observation satellites have three or more radiometers. Each acquires one digital image (in remote sensing, called a 'scene') in a small spectral band. The bands are grouped into wavelength regions based on the origin of the light and the interests of the researchers.\n\nIn the case of Landsat satellites, several different band designations have been used, with as many as 11 bands (Landsat 8) comprising a multispectral image.\nSpectral imaging with a higher radiometric resolution\n(involving hundreds or thousands of bands), finer spectral resolution (involving smaller bands), or wider spectral coverage may be called hyperspectral or ultraspectral.\n\nThe technology has also assisted in the interpretation of ancient papyri, such as those found at Herculaneum, by imaging the fragments in the infrared range (1000 nm). Often, the text on the documents appears to the naked eye as black ink on black paper. At 1000 nm, the difference in how paper and ink reflect infrared light makes the text clearly readable. It has also been used to image the Archimedes palimpsest by imaging the parchment leaves in bandwidths from 365-870 nm, and then using advanced digital image processing techniques to reveal the undertext with Archimedes' work. Multispectral imaging has been used in a Mellon Foundation project at Yale University to compare inks in medieval English manuscripts.\n\nMultispectral imaging can be employed for investigation of paintings and other works of art. The painting is irradiated by ultraviolet, visible and infrared rays and the reflected radiation is recorded in a camera sensitive in this regions of the spectrum. The image can also be registered using the transmitted instead of reflected radiation. In special cases the painting can be irradiated by UV, VIS or IR rays and the fluorescence of pigments or varnishes can be registered.\n\nMultispectral imaging has also been used to examine discolorations and stains on old books and manuscripts. Comparing the \"spectral fingerprint\" of a stain to the characteristics of known chemical substances can make it possible to identify the stain. This technique has been used to examine medical and alchemical texts, seeking hints about the activities of early chemists and the possible chemical substances they may have used in their experiments. Like a cook spilling flour or vinegar on a cookbook, an early chemist might have left tangible evidence on the pages of the ingredients used to make medicines.\n\nThe wavelengths are approximate; exact values depend on the particular satellite's instruments:\n\nFor different purposes, different combinations of spectral bands can be used. They are usually represented with red, green, and blue channels. Mapping of bands to colors depends on the purpose of the image and the personal preferences of the analysts. Thermal infrared is often omitted from consideration due to poor spatial resolution, except for special purposes.\nMany other combinations are in use. NIR is often shown as red, causing vegetation-covered areas to appear red.\n\nUnlike other Aerial photographic and satellite image interpretation work, these multispectral images do not make it easy to identify directly the feature type by visual inspection. Hence the remote sensing data has to be classified first, followed by processing by various data enhancement techniques so as to help the user to understand the features that are present in the image.\n\nSuch classification is a complex task which involves rigorous validation of the training samples depending on the classification algorithm used. The techniques can be grouped mainly into two types.\n\nSupervised classification makes use of training samples. Training samples are areas on the ground for which there is Ground truth, that is, what is there is known. The spectral signatures of the training areas are used to search for similar signatures in the remaining pixels of the image, and we will classify accordingly. This use of training samples for classification is called supervised classification. Expert knowledge is very important in this method since the selection of the training samples and a biased selection can badly affect the accuracy of classification. Popular techniques include the Maximum likelihood principle and Convolutional neural network. The Maximum likelihood principle calculates the probability of a pixel belonging to a class (i.e. feature) and allots the pixel to its most probable class. Newer Convolutional neural network based methods account for both spatial proximity and entire spectra to determine the most likely class.\n\nIn case of unsupervised classification no prior knowledge is required for classifying the features of the image. The natural clustering or grouping of the pixel values, i.e. the gray levels of the pixels, are observed. Then a threshold is defined for adopting the number of classes in the image. The finer the threshold value, the more classes there will be. However, beyond a certain limit the same class will be represented in different classes in the sense that variation in the class is represented. After forming the clusters, ground truth validation is done to identify the class the image pixel belongs to. Thus in this unsupervised classification apriori information about the classes is not required. One of the popular methods in unsupervised classification is k-means clustering.\n\n\n\n"}

Everyone on board was about to give up all hope of surviving this natural disaster when an attractive young lady, who had boarded the boat at the eleventh hour, stood up and ordered the tempest to calm down. The gale ceased and the sea became calm. The fishing boat, without further event, arrived safely at the port of Hoi Keang. The young lady walked ashore to the top of the Barra Hill where, in a glowing\naura of light and fragrance; she immediately ascended into heaven. A temple was built on the specific location where she set foot.\n\nSeveral hundred years later (circa 1513), when Portuguese sailors landed and asked the name of the place, the locals replied \"媽閣\" (). The Portuguese then named the peninsula \"Macao\" and several hundred years after that (circa 1911) they changed the spelling to \"Macau\" as part of the Reforms of Portuguese orthography.\n\nToday the two spellings remain in common use due to the transcription of place names in two different Chinese dialects. For Cantonese, the dialect spoken in Macau and Hong Kong, the transcription is \"Macau\" the same as with Lantau Island. For Mandarin, the dialect that forms the basis of Standard Chinese, the transcription is \"Macao\" the same as with Qingdao.\n\nThe Chinese name \"Aomen\" 澳門 (pinyin: \"Àomén\", Cantonese: \"Ou3 Mun4*2\" ) means \"Inlet Gates\". The \"gates\" refer to two erect gate-like mountains of Nantai () and Beitai (). Alternately, \"Ao\" may derive from Macau's previous name \"Heong San Ou\", as it is geographically situated at \"Cross' Door\".\n\nMacau is also known as:\n\nWhile \"Ou3 Mun2\" is the traditional Cantonese name of the place, it is common among the Cantonese-speaking population to use the source of the Portuguese name, 馬交 \"Maa5 Gaau1\" . The form \"Macao\" was the original Portuguese spelling, which continues to be used by the governments of some European countries that never made the change to \"Macau\". In the modern era, both the spellings \"Macau\" and \"Macao\" are accepted as correct spelling.\n\nSince the transfer of sovereignty over Macau in 1999, the government of Macau considers both \"Macau\" and \"Macao\" to be acceptable spellings of the name in English language publications.\n\nDualism is visible in many English language government publications and documents, sometimes even within the same paragraph. For example, the spelling \"Macao\" appears on the local government's English language emblem as seen at its web portal and also at the official website of the Macao Government Tourism Office. Similarly, \"Macao\" is used on the Macau Special Administrative Region passport, but the government's official explanatory note on the passport spells it as \"Macau\".\n\n\"Macao\" is also the designated name of the ISO 3166-1 country code , and of the top-level domain .mo.\n\nThere are two official versions of the Basic Law of Macau, one in Chinese and one in Portuguese, according to articles 136 and 137 of the Basic Law the place may represent itself as “中國澳門” or \"Macau, China\".\n\nIn comparison, the central government of the China consistently spells its name using the old Portuguese spelling \"Macao\". Less commonly used is the pinyin transcription of \"Aomen\", but its usage is not used officially. The decision not to adopt pinyin names after the handover to China appears to be consistent with the usual PRC policy of respecting the local linguistic traditions in the romanized version of names, as in other non-pinyin names like Lhasa, Ürümqi or Hohhot, for example. Phonetically the spelling \"Macao\" produces a pinyin pronunciation similar to 馬交 Mǎjiāo which explains the preference for this spelling among Mandarin speakers.\n\nNotwithstanding the official Basic Law of Macau requirement to use \"Macau, China\", Macau participates in international organisations and international sport events like World Trade Organization and International Monetary Fund meetings and East Asian Games as \"Macao, China\".\n\n"}

MBS consumes significantly less power than GPS, and includes high-precision altitude. In the United States, NextNav operates its MBS network over its spectrum licenses in the 920-928 MHz band.\n\nNextNav was founded in 2008 by Ganesh Pattabiraman (Co-Founder, President and CEO), Subramanian Meiyappan (Co-Founder and VP Hardware Engineering) and Dr. Arun Raghupathy (Co-Founder and VP Systems Engineering) in Sunnyvale, CA.\n\nThe founding team consists of technologists with a background in solving complex technological problems. Ganesh Pattabiraman, Co-Founder, Director and President/CEO of the Company, formerly worked at Qualcomm, where he managed location systems ranged from satellite-based systems with global scale to highly localized Bluetooth-based systems. Dr. Arun Raghupathy, Co-founder and VP of Systems Engineering, was originally at Qualcomm and most recently at Texas Instruments, where he managed TI’s GPS Chip development. Subbu Meiyappan, Co-founder and VP of Hardware Engineering, formerly worked with Airgo Networks which was acquired by Qualcomm.\n\nThe company’s management team has experience in developing and rolling out nationwide networks and commercializing advanced technology.\n\nGary Parsons, the former Chairman of Sirius XM Radio and founder of XM Satellite Radio is Executive Chairman of the Board at NextNav. Dr. Rajendra Singh, the Founder of LCC International, Recipient of Wireless Hall of Fame serves as Vice Chairman. Dr. Norm Krasner, Founder and CTO of SnapTrack Inc., is the Chief Science Advisor to the Company.\n\nThe NextNav network uses Metropolitan Beacon System technology to deliver high precision three-dimensional indoor location capabilities across a market area. MBS is built on principles similar to GPS transmitting precisely timed signals from a network of wide-area beacons enabling receivers to use trilateration techniques to determine their precise location. This differs significantly from other approaches to indoor and urban location, which rely on short-range, local-area transmitters.\n\nDue to the terrestrial placement of the transmitters and sub-GHz nature of the signal, MBS signals can travel several kilometers and—because the network is specifically designed, deployed, and managed for indoor positioning—can be reliably received in deep indoor conditions that block satellite signals (e.g., GPS, GLONASS). MBS signals also enable location to be computed with far lower power drain than GPS. In addition, the system incorporates barometric pressure compensation technology that allows receivers equipped with pressure sensors to compute their altitude very precisely, typically within a floor.\n\nA byproduct of the GPS-like operating principles of NextNav’s MBS network is the ability to deliver high-precision (Stratum-1-level) timing to indoor locations or in the event of GPS outages.\n\nMBS receivers are being commercialized as an additional constellation added to multi-constellation GNSS processors. Today’s GPS processors typically process additional satellite constellations, and the MBS processing capability constitutes primarily firmware additions.\n\nThe performance of the technology under emergency dialing conditions was originally demonstrated in the CSRIC III test bed in San Francisco in 2012, with performance enhancements added on an ongoing basis. More recently the technology was enabled in the primary global telecommunication standards bodies, 3GPP (Release 13) and OMA (SUPL 2.0.3). MBS signal technology is available under FRAND terms.\n\nThe technology can be scaled for any location application, including services to mobile phones, Internet of Things, and enterprise and public safety applications.\n\nNextNav's Urban and Indoor Positioning service is now available in San Francisco Bay Area, McLean, VA and other select markets. The Company has an initial presence in 45 additional markets in the US and is in deployment.\n"}

{"id": "1428088", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1428088", "title": "Pseudorange", "text": "Pseudorange\n\nThe pseudorange (from pseudo- and range) is the \"pseudo\" distance between a satellite and a navigation satellite receiver (see GNSS positioning calculation) —for instance Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers. \n\nTo determine its position, a satellite navigation receiver will determine the ranges to (at least) four satellites as well as their positions at time of transmitting. Knowing the satellites' orbital parameters, these positions can be calculated for any point in time. The pseudoranges of each satellite are obtained by multiplying the speed of light by the time the signal has taken from the satellite to the receiver. As there are accuracy errors in the time measured, the term \"pseudo\"-ranges is used rather than ranges for such distances.\n\nTypically a quartz oscillator is used in the receiver to do the timing. The accuracy of quartz clocks in general is worse (i.e. more) than one part in a million; if the clock hasn't been corrected for a week, the distance will put you not on the Earth but outside the Moon's orbit. Even if the clock is corrected, a second later the clock is not usable anymore for positional calculation, because after a second the error will be hundreds of meters for a typical quartz clock. But in a GPS receiver the clock's time is used to measure the ranges to different satellites at almost the same time, meaning all the measured ranges have the same error. Ranges with the same error are called pseudoranges. By finding the pseudo-range of an additional fourth satellite for precise position calculation, the time error can also be estimated. Therefore, by having the pseudoranges and the locations of four satellites, the actual receiver's position along the \"x\", \"y\", \"z\" axes and the time error formula_1 can be computed accurately. \n\nThe reason we speak of \"pseudo\"-ranges rather than ranges, is precisely this \"contamination\" with unknown receiver clock offset. GPS positioning is sometimes referred to as trilateration, but would be more accurately referred to as \"pseudo-trilateration\". \n\nFollowing the laws of error propagation, neither the receiver position nor the clock offset are computed exactly, but rather \"estimated\" through a least squares adjustment procedure known from geodesy.\nTo describe this imprecision, so-called GDOP quantities have been defined: geometric dilution of precision (x,y,z,t).\nPseudorange calculations therefore use the signals of four satellites to compute the receiver's location and the clock error. A clock with an accuracy of one in a million will introduce an error of one millionth of a second each second. This error multiplied by the speed of light gives an error of 300 meters. For a typical satellite constellation this error will increase by about formula_2 (less if satellites are close together, more if satellites are all near the horizon). If positional calculation was done using this clock and only using three satellites, just standing still the GPS would indicate that you are traveling at a speed in excess of 300 meters per second, (over 1000 km/hour or 600 miles an hour). With only signals from three satellites the GPS receiver would not be able to determine whether the 300m/s was due to clock error or actual movement of the GPS receiver.\n\nIf the satellites being used are scattered throughout the sky, then the value of geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) is low while if satellites are clustered near each other from the receiver's vantage point the GDOP values are higher. The lower the value of GDOP then the better the ratio of position error to range error computing will be, so GDOP plays an important role in calculating the receiver's position on the surface of the earth using pseudoranges. The larger the number of satellites, the better the value of GDOP will be.\n\n"}

A few rural areas were still served by manual exchanges. Crossbar exchanges were installed from the 1970s, and electronic exchanges from 1982. Local telephone number lengths varied from 3 to 6 digits depending on the size of exchange and population of the local calling area.\n\nNumerous complex dialling instructions appeared in the front of telephone books explaining the number sequences needed to reach subscribers in local \"free calling\" areas, and in a few cases for short distance toll calls (usually to the local city or town), which were recorded on manually read meters in some step-by-step local exchanges. Local calls were free, and still are for residential customers. Long distance (toll) calls required the manual intervention of an operator, who had access to toll circuits, either via an operator's cord board or a toll exchange (switch). Access to the toll operator was by dialling \"0\".\n\nLocal directory service could be accessed via \"100\", telephone faults via \"120\", and emergency services by dialling \"111\".\n\nSubscriber toll dialling (STD) was introduced in the New Zealand telephone network in the mid 1970s, a result of the introduction of NEC crossbar-based toll exchanges and their ability to perform number translation. One still needed to dial \"0\" to make a toll call, but instead of calling the operator, one could then dial the STD number directly. Access to the operator was via \"010\", while other service numbers remained unchanged.\n\nThe original STD codes were numbered roughly south to north, with a few exceptions. Some of the STD codes were:\n\nSTD codes were assigned with larger areas having short STD codes (e.g. Auckland - 09), while smaller areas had longer STD codes and shorter local numbers (e.g. Shannon - 06927). The total number length, that is STD code and local number excluding the first 0, usually totalled seven digits, but could vary up to nine, often as exchanges increased the length of local numbers to accommodate new lines.\n\nWith the introduction of NEC stored program control exchanges in the New Zealand telephone network during the 1980s, and the rapid growth in demand, the breakup of the New Zealand Post Office and the creation of Telecom, local telephone numbers were standardised to seven digits. In many parts of the country, the old area code was incorporated into the new number, however in some areas the numbers changed completely.\n\nAt the same time, the opportunity was taken to move directory service from 100 to 018 and charge for directory service calls. The justification for doing so was the introduction of a directory service computer system that gave access to current New Zealand telephone number listings, not just those printed in the telephone book, and the need for a separate user pays revenue stream for Telecom Directory Services, which was separate to the 5 regional (local) telephone companies, TNI and Telecom Mobile that Telecom had split itself into, as part of the sale of Telecom and deregulation of New Zealand telecommunications services.\n\nSince 1993, land-line telephone numbers in New Zealand consist of a single-digit area code and a seven-digit local number, of which the first three digits generally specify the exchange and the final four specify the subscriber's unique line at that exchange.\n\nThe long distance trunk prefix, \"0\", which is prepended to national numbers, is not part of the international number.\n\nThe minimum number length after the international prefix is three digits. Most numbers, other than service numbers have at least eight digits.\n\nThe maximum number length after the international prefix is nine digits, except numbers starting with \"210\" (ten digits).\n\nNew Zealand follows an open numbering plan. The country code is \"64\". The long distance dialing prefix is \"0\". The international prefix is \"00\".\n\nNew Zealand landline phone numbers have a total of eight digits excluding the leading 0: a one-digit area code, and a seven-digit phone number (e.g. 09 700 1234), beginning with a digit between 2 and 9 (but excluding 900, 911, and 999 due to misdial guards).\nThere are five regional area codes: 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9. These must be dialled, along with the domestic trunk prefix, when calling a recipient outside the local calling area of which the caller is located. For example, one calling Dunedin from Christchurch must dial 03, even though Christchurch is 03 as well.\n\nThe combined domestic trunk prefix and area codes are:\n\nThe first few digits of the local number can specify the general area of the telephone numbers. Note the names below are of the local calling areas.\n\n\n\n\nTelephone numbers for mobile phones begin with 02, followed by seven to nine digits (usually eight). The first few digits after the 02 indicate the original mobile network that issued the number.\n\nTelephone numbers must always be dialled in full for mobile phones. In the late 1990s however, Telecom mobile phones could dial other Telecom mobile phones without the (then) 025 prefix, making 025 act like a landline area code.\n\nThe introduction of mobile number portability on 1 April 2007 meant that an increasing number of mobiles will be operating on a different network to that which originally assigned the number.\nTo find out whether a particular number belongs to a specific network provider, one can text the mobile number of interest to 300. It is a free service provided by 2degrees. A reply will be sent to verify whether the number is operating on their network or not. Note: Some reports indicate this service will work for Vodafone and Spark, but as at 05/11/2014 only 2Degrees appears to support this service.\n\nToll-free numbers begin with 0508 or 0800, usually followed by six digits (some numbers have seven digits).\nPremium rate services use the code 0900 followed by five digits (some with six digits).\nLocal rate numbers, such as Internet access numbers, have the prefix 08xx, and are usually followed by five digits.\n\n\nNumbers beginning with 01 are for operator services.\n\n\nThe '1' codes are used for local services, including activating exchange features. The emergency services number is '111'.\n\n\nThe mobile network also recognises telephone numbers starting with *, including:\n\n\nText message numbers for mobile phones are 3 or 4 digits long.\n\n\nNew Zealand has no dedicated series of fictional telephone numbers. Television shows and movies generally use any available range of numbers (e.g. the TVNZ soap opera \"Shortland Street\" uses the unassigned (09) 4299 number range.).\n\n\n"}

Prior to the publication of \"The Great Railway Bazaar,\" Theroux lived in Africa, Singapore, and England.\n\nIn a 2013 article, Theroux outlined several inspirations that led him to embark on his famous journey and publish his experiences. These include his fascination for trains, which offered what he described as an opportunity to break monotony as well as a respite for him who never turns away work. He wrote:I could think clearly on the London trains and when, on the rare occasions, I travelled out of London – on the Exeter line via Sherborne, Yeovil, and Crewkerne, to visit my in‑laws, or on the Flying Scotsman on a journalistic assignment, my spirits revived and I saw with clarity that it might be possible to conceive a book based on a long railway journey.In 2006, Theroux retraced the journey, finding that people and places had changed, and that while he was famous for his earlier work he was not recognised in person. His account of this second journey was published as \"Ghost Train to the Eastern Star\".\n"}
