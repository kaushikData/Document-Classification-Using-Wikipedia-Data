The AAIW is formed at the ocean surface in the Antarctic Convergence zone or more commonly called the Antarctic Polar Front zone. This convergence zone is normally located between 50°S and 60°S, hence this is where almost all of the AAIW is formed.\n\nThe AAIW is unique water mass in that it is a sinking water mass with a moderately low salinity, unlike most sinking water masses which have a relatively high salinity. This salinity minimum, unique to the AAIW, can be recognized throughout the Southern Ocean at depths ranging from 700 to 1200 meters. Typical temperature values for the AAIW are 3-7°C, and a salinity of 34.2-34.4 psu upon initial formation. Due to vertical mixing at intermediate depths in the Southern Ocean, the salinity slowly rises as it moves northward. Typical density of AAIW water is between 1026.82 kg/m³ and 1027.43 kg/m³. The thickness of the AAIW ranges greatly between where it forms and its most northern extent.\n\nThe formation of AAIW can be explained very simply through the Ekman transport process and the divergence and convergence of water masses. The winds over Antarctica are called the polar easterlies where winds blow from the east to the west. This creates a counter-clockwise surface current near the coast of Antarctica, called the Antarctic Coastal Current. Ekman transport causes the water to push towards the left of the surface motion in the Southern Hemisphere. Thus, this westward directed coastal current in Antarctica will push the water towards Antarctica.\n\nAt the same time there is a strong current north of the Antarctic Coastal Current, called the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) created by the strong westerlies in this region which flows clockwise around Antarctica. Again, Ekman transport will push this water to the left of the surface motion, meaning away from Antarctica. Because water just offshore of Antarctica is being pushed away and into Antarctica, it leads to the Antarctic Divergence region. Here, upwelling of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) takes place. NADW is cold and quite saline. Once the NADW is upwelled to the surface some of it diverges towards Antarctica, gets colder, and sinks back down as Antarctic Bottom Water.\n\nThe NADW water also diverges away from Antarctica when it is upwelled. This diverged water moves northward (equatorward), and at the same time persistent precipitation (location is near the polar lows ~60°S) along with an influx of melt water decreases the salinity of the original NADW. Because the salinity of the NADW has changed by so much and it has essentially lost all its unique characteristics to be NADW, this northward propagating surface water is now called Antarctic Surface Water (AASW). Also, the AASW movement northward has gained some heat from the atmosphere, thereby increasing the temperature slightly.\n\nWhen this water reaches between 50°S and 60°S it encounters the Antarctic Convergence zone. At this point the Subantarctic waters, which are characterized as being much warmer than the Antarctic waters, are just north of the Antarctic Polar Front and the Antarctic waters are just south of the Antarctic Polar Front. This region is referred to as the Antarctic Convergence Zone/Antarctic Polar Front because of the sharp gradients in both temperature and salinity (esp. temperature) between the Antarctic waters and the Subantarctic waters. It is also a region of strong vertical mixing. It is important to note that this convergence zone does not occur simply because the Subantarctic water is flowing southward and the AASW is flowing northward, but due to Ekman convergence.\n\nOnce the northward propagating Antarctic Surface Water reaches the Antarctic Convergence zone it begins to sink because it is more dense than the Subantarctic water to its north, but less dense than the Antarctic water to its south. This water is then referred to as AAIW. The sinking AAIW becomes sandwiched between the Subantarctic water (above) which is much warmer, but more saline and the NADW (below) which is cold and quite salty.\n\nFor many years the aforementioned formation of AAIW was thought to be the only formation process. Recent studies have found that there exists some evidence that some Subantarctic mode water is able to penetrate through the Subantarctic front (frontal region separating the Polar frontal zone from the Subantarctic zone) and become the dominant source of AAIW, rather than the AASW. Because of the difficulty of getting observations in this very treacherous area, this research on Subantarctic mode water mixing theory is still being worked out, but a lot of evidence exists for its inclusion in the formation of AAIW. It is important to note that the biggest source of AAIW formation is just southwest of the southern tip of South America.\n\nThe interesting characteristic of AAIW is how far it extends northward. The salinity minima associated with the AAIW can be seen in intermediate waters (~1000m) as far north as 20°N, with trace amounts as far as 60°N. It is by far the largest spreading intermediate water of all the ocean intermediate water masses. It continues northward until it encounters other intermediate water masses (e.g.AIW). The movement of the AAIW is predominantly northward due to the Ekman volume transport mostly directed in that way. When the AAIW is initially formed, the ACC is able to transport the AAIW into all ocean basins because the ACC flows clockwise around Antarctica with no land based boundaries.\n\n"}

In addition to increasing the emphasis on geography within the school system, Can Geo Education endeavours to increase the geographic literacy of all Canadians through the formal K-12 education system.\n\nCan Geo Education creates innovative educational resources for teachers in K-12 education. Since 2012, the organization has been producing giant floor maps — themed maps printed on 11 metre by 8 metre heavy-stock vinyl that can be walked on. Teachers are provided with lesson plans to educate their students on the map, and the maps circulate Canadian schools at no cost to them. Current and past themes have included the War of 1812, Canada from space (with the Canadian Space Agency), a circular North Pole map (with the Canadian Museum of Nature), the country's national parks (with Parks Canada), and North America's animal migrations (with the Canadian Wildlife Federation).\n\nThe Canadian Geographic Challenge (formerly the Great Canadian Geography Challenge), established in 1995, is the longest-running Canadian national student geography competition organized annually by Can Geo Education for students from Grades 4 to 10. There are two levels of competition — Level 1 is for Grades 4 to 6 is at the school level only, and Level 2 for Grades 7 to 10 offers students the opportunity to compete at the provincial and national levels. At school level, students answer up to 90 geography-related questions. The student who succeeds in his school takes an online questionnaire, then can move on to provincial and national levels.\n\nOther programs of the organization include the Classroom Energy Diet Challenge with Shell Canada and Canada's Coolest School Trip with Parks Canada.\n\n"}

Some of KRBC's phenomenal discoveries were the discovery of an ancient site in the Pawon Cave on December 9, 2000. For the first time, tools made of stones and bones, earthenware, bone remnants, and animal teeth were discovered in Pawon Cave located at Pasir Pawon, which still in the area of Citatah karst.\n\nCitatah is a very productive limestone mining area. This mining has been operated since the mid-19th century and still continues until now. By using more sophisticated tools and dynamite to blow up parts of the hills containing limestone, mining activity in this area has brought adverse impact on Citatah environment.\n\nGenerally, there are three cliffs in Citatah which are Citatah Cliff 48, Citatah Cliff 90 and Citatah Cliff 125. The name itself is a representative of their height.\n\nCitatah 48 is located at Jl. Pamucatan Raya, Bandung, West Java. This cliff is formed from limestone. Its height is about 40–50 meters, hence it is called as Citatah 48. Although this cliff has official name Manik Mountain, Citatah 48 is much more well known mostly by climbers. There are 25 climbing paths with different difficulties in this cliff.\n\nCitatah 48 has distinctive features that distinguish it from other Citatah cliffs. There is a dagger-shaped monument on top of this cliff.\n\nThis cliff is under the surveillance of Kopassus (Indonesian army special force). To climb this cliff, legal permission from Kopassus is required. The permission must be obtained from the Training Center for Special Forces Training or Pusdipassus located in Batu Jajar, West Bandung. Activity permit must be submitted approximately one month before the activity.\n\nCitatah 90's official name is Mount Pabeasa. Similar to the other two Citatah cliffs, Citatah 90 is made of limestone and located in Padalarang, Bandung, West Java. With a height around 90 meters, this cliff is located in the area of a limestone mine. Citatah 90 has a higher difficulty level of climb than other two cliffs. Its fragile surface increases the difficulty in climbing this mountain.There are about 4–5 commonly used climbing paths for this mountain.\n\nCitatah 125 is located at Mount Singgalang, the highest limestone mountain in the area. Its exact location is in Citatah Village, Cipatat district, West Bandung regency. Its name comes from its 125 meter height from the surface. It is formed from andesite and marble rocks.\n\nCitatah 125 is the center for rock climbing training. Rock climbing school in Bandung, Jakarta and their surrounding area use this place due to its easy access, which is located near Bandung – Cianjur highway.\n\nThere are many climbing routes available at this mountain. From easy to the most difficult route, climbers can choose the route they want to climb such as Hanoman or Eagle route. Each route has different characteristics. This diversity of climbing routes is suitable for educational purposes, mostly to introduce rock climbing to beginners.Therefore, climbers of Citatah 125 come from various backgrounds, from rookies to professional climbers.\n\n"}
{"id": "3808633", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3808633", "title": "Conservation International", "text": "Conservation International\n\nConservation International (CI) is an American nonprofit environmental organization headquartered in Arlington, Virginia. Its goal is to protect nature as a source of food, fresh water, livelihoods and a stable climate.\n\nCI's work focuses on science, policy, and partnership with businesses and communities. The organization employs more than 1,000 people and works with more than 2,000 partners in 30 countries. CI has helped support 1,200 protected areas and interventions across 77 countries, safeguarding more than 601 million hectares of land, marine and coastal areas.\n\nConservation International was founded in 1987 with the goal of protecting nature for the benefit of people.\n\nIn 1989, CI formally committed to the protection of biodiversity hotspots, ultimately identifying 34 such hotspots around the world and contributing to their protection. The model of protecting hotspots became a key way for organizations to do conservation work.\n\nAs of FY 2016, CI's revenue totaled $212 million.\n\nOn July 1, 2017, Peter Seligmann stepped down as CEO of CI and a new executive team made up of senior CI leadership was announced. Conservation scientist M. Sanjayan was named chief executive officer; Jennifer Morris, formerly chief operating officer, was named president; and Sebastian Troeng, formerly senior vice president of the Americas Field Division, was named executive vice president. Peter Seligmann will remain Chairman of the Board.\n\nIn the subsequent two decades, CI expanded its work, with a stronger focus on science, corporate partnership, conservation funding, indigenous peoples, government, and marine conservation, among other things.\n\nThe organization's leadership grew to believe that CI's focus on biodiversity conservation was inadequate to protect nature and those who depended on it. CI updated its mission in 2008 to focus explicitly on the connections between human well-being and natural ecosystems.\n\nAs of FY2014, CI's expenses totaled more than US $135.3 million.\n\nCI receives high ratings from philanthropic watchdog organizations, with an A rating from Charity Watch. Charity Navigator awarded CI a score of 92.28 out of 100 for accountability and transparency.\n\nThe foundation of CI's work is \"science, partnership and field demonstration.\" The organization has scientists, policy workers and other conservationists on the ground in more than 30 countries. It also relies heavily on thousands of local partners.\n\nCI works with governments, universities, NGOs and the private sector with the aim of replicating these successes on a larger scale. By showing how conservation can work at all scales, CI aims to make the protection of nature a key consideration in economic development decisions around the world. CI supported 23 Pacific Island nations and territories in the formation of the Pacific Oceanscape, a framework to conserve and sustainably manage over 15 million square miles of sea in the South Pacific. In addition to the sustainable management of ocean resources, the agreement includes the world's largest marine protected areas and sanctuaries for whales, dolphins, turtles and sharks.\n\nThe organization has been active in United Nations discussions on issues such as climate change and biodiversity, and its scientists present at international conferences and workshops. Its United States policy work currently highlights \"a direct connection between international conservation and America's economic and national security interests.\"\n\nA few years after its founding, CI began working with McDonald's to implement sustainable agriculture and conservation projects in Central America. The organization expanded its commitment to working with the business sector in 2000, when it created the Center for Environmental Leadership in Business with support from the Ford Motor Company.\n\nCI has been criticized for links to companies such as BP, Cargill, Chevron, Monsanto and Shell. CI has defended its work with the private sector, arguing that change requires working with corporations that have large environmental impacts. \n\nA 2008 article in \"The Nation\" claimed that the organization had attracted $6 million for marine conservation in Papua New Guinea, but that the funds were used for \"little more than plush offices and first class travel.\" CI has touted its operations in Papua New Guinea, claiming that they have contributed to new scientific discoveries and the establishment of new protected areas.\n\nIn 2011, Conservation International was targeted by a group of reporters from Don't Panic TV who posed as an American company and asked if the charity could \"raise [their] green profile.\" Options outlined by the representative of Conservation International (CI) included assisting with the company's green PR efforts, membership of a business forum in return for a fee, and sponsorship packages where the company could potentially invest money in return for being associated with conservation activities. Conservation International agreed to help the company find an \"endangered species mascot\". Film footage shows the Conservation International employee suggesting a vulture and North African birds of prey as a possible endangered species mascot for the company. CI contends that these recordings were heavily edited to remove elements that would have cast CI in a more favorable light, while using other parts of the video out of context to paint an inaccurate and incomplete picture of CI's work with the private sector.\n\nIn May and June 2013, Survival International reported that an indigenous Bushman tribe in Botswana was threatened with eviction from their ancestral land in order to create a wildlife corridor known as the Western Kgalagadi Conservation Corridor. A Botswana government representative denied this. A May press release from CI said, \"Contrary to recent reports, Conservation International (CI) has not been involved in the implementation of conservation corridors in Botswana since 2011,\" and asserted that CI had always supported the San Bushmen and their rights.\n\n\n\n"}

At the bottom of this page are working \"External Links\" as at 4 November 2011 to websites of a selection of such County Surveyor's departments. Most of these officials are elected on the partisan ballot to four-year terms. They administer the county land survey records, re-establish and maintain the official government survey monuments, and review property boundaries surveys and subdivision plans. Other duties vary from state to state. Those marked with an asterisk (*) are nominated by the National Association of County Surveyors (NACS).\n\nNACS is part of the National Association of Counties of the USA (NACo). The NACo website sets out its perception of the history of county government in the USA, tracing it to Anglo-Saxon England (initial division of land into holdings for government purposes called 'shires', hence 'shire-reeve', the origin of 'sheriff'), Anglo-Norman feudalism (renaming shires conquered by William I as 'counties' and establishing his allodial title to them via the Domesday Book survey), and the increasingly \"plural executive structure\" commissioned by his successors to the royal throne of England to defend the peace and enforce the complex of chivalric, common, and statutory laws of England (and of Wales from the reign of Edward I) up to the time of the first county government established in America (County of James City, Virginia). This triad of origins is fundamental to understanding the organisation role that county surveying plays in the administration and development of the real estate of many states and nations around the world, even though sometimes it goes by other names. It was the framework that the King of England applied to his colonies in America and sufficiently successful as to have since been adopted by many other states.\n\nChapter V 'The Development of an Extra-Legal Constitution', of 'English Local Government from the Revolution to the Municipal Corporations Act: The Parish and The County' by Sidney Webb and Beatrice Potter Web, describes the increasing chaos that began to prevail within this same period on the 'county surveying' front in England and Wales. Eventually, the military defence component of county surveying in the UK began to separate from the civil in 1791, with the Crown's 'Board of Ordnance' being commissioned to carry out a comprehensive survey of the South Coast of England which, as a result of 'the last invasion of Britain 1797', at Fishguard in South West Wales ultimately extended to all of the UK. With that shift in emphasis, county surveying began to concentrate more on its civil engineering and civic architecture roles, producing the historically famous British county surveyors such as Thomas Telford, John Loudon McAdam and John Nash; the expression, \"County Surveyor\", became a UK statutory title (Bridges Act 1803); and, in England and Wales, its incumbents were appointed by elected councils as of the coming into effect of the Local Government Act 1888 rather than being Crown-appointed by Justices of the Peace.\n\nThe UK equivalent of NACS, namely, the County Surveyors Society (CSS) founded in 1885, was subsumed into the pluralistic Association of Directors of Environment, Economy, Planning and Transport (ADEPT) in 2010.\n\nCalifornia\n\nColorado\n\nFlorida\n\nIdaho\n\nIndiana\n\nMichigan\n\nMinnesota\n\nNebraska\n\nOregon\n\nUtah\n\nWashington\n\nWisconsin\n"}

It is similar to performing a principal components analysis on the data, except that the EOF method finds both time series and spatial patterns. The term is also interchangeable with the geographically weighted PCAs in geophysics.\n\nThe \"i\" basis function is chosen to be orthogonal to the basis functions from the first through \"i\" − 1, and to minimize the residual variance. That is, the basis functions are chosen to be different from each other, and to account for as much variance as possible.\n\nThe method of EOF analysis is similar in spirit to harmonic analysis, but harmonic analysis typically uses predetermined orthogonal functions, for example, sine and cosine functions at fixed frequencies. In some cases the two methods may yield essentially the same results.\n\nThe basis functions are typically found by computing the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the data set. A more advanced technique is to form a kernel out of the data, using a fixed kernel. The basis functions from the eigenvectors of the kernel matrix are thus non-linear in the location of the data (see Mercer's theorem and the kernel trick for more information).\n\n\n"}

A large remnant of the Esker exists in the Teernacreeve region of Westmeath, and stretches from Kilbeggan to Tyrrellspass. \n\nThe eskers take the form of relatively low-lying ridges composed of sand, gravel and boulders; deposited by water flowing beneath a glacier; that became exposed when the glacier melted at the end of the last ice age, around 10,000 years ago.\n\nThe Irish name 'Eiscir Riada' provides an indication of the significance of the eskers, 'Eiscir' meaning 'divide' and 'Riada' meaning 'road'.\n\nFollowing a battle at Maynooth, in the year 123 AD, the island of Ireland was divided into two political entities along the line of the eskers – ‘Leath Cuinn’ (‘Conn’s Half’) to the north, and ‘Leath Mogha’ (‘Mogha’s Half’) to the south.\n\nBecause the slightly higher ground of the Esker Riada provided a route through the bogs of the Irish midlands it has, since ancient times, formed a highway joining the east and west of Ireland. Indeed, its ancient Gaelic name is ‘An tSlí Mhór’, meaning ‘The Great Way’. \n\nThe Great Highway provided a link between Durrow Abbey and the monastic settlement of Clonmacnoise, constructed at the point where the River Shannon passes through the Esker Riada. \n\nIn contrast with the surrounding boglands, the glacial sands typical of the eskers provided well drained and relatively good quality land, proving useful in agricultural terms.\n\nTo this day, the Esker Riada continues to serve as a highway, the main N6 Dublin to Galway road still closely following it; and much agricultural activity still takes place along its length. The Dublin part begins at High Street, beside Wood Quay, where the Viking settlement and the original ford made of hurdles, or basketwork, that gives Dublin its name \"(Átha Cliath)\" and follows southwest through Kilmainham to Greenhills Road.\n\nThe eskers have become a valued source of building material, with sand and gravel extraction being commonplace. However, the negative environmental impact of such operations is now being realized and this, along with a developing awareness of the ridge and its significance in Ireland’s history, has led to increasing restrictions. Indeed, Offaly County Council has moved to give the ridge protection in its County Development Plan, and has gone so far as to press to have the Esker Riada recognized as a World Heritage Site.\n"}

{"id": "43124877", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43124877", "title": "Janet Freeman", "text": "Janet Freeman\n\nJanet Freeman (May 18, 1950 – April 29, 2011) was a community organizer and activist for tenant's rights in New York City's lower Manhattan. On June 20, 2013, the corner of Elizabeth Street and Kenmare Street was co-named \"Janet Freeman Way\" by the New York City Council in her memory and to commemorate her activism on behalf of the community. According to \"NYC Streets\" in its listing of street names and their honorees, \"Janet Freeman was a community organizer and tenant advocate. She founded the Croman Tenants Association; the Coalition to Protect Public Housing and Section 8; and Co-op Watch, to prevent evictions through phony conversions. She started campaigns to organize tenants against aggressive landlords, phony demolitions, and harassment in and around Chinatown and Little Italy.\"\n\nJanet Freeman grew up in Stuyvesant Town, a middle-income housing complex in Manhattan, New York City. At the age of 17, she moved to Elizabeth Street, eventually occupying a vacant storefront where she lived until her death in 2011. The storefront was notable for its heavily tagged graffiti cover in a neighborhood renowned for its tagging and graffiti art -- (both the Candle Building and the Germania Bank Building (New York City) are down the block and around the corner respectively).\n\nAccording to Tenant/Inquilino, the newspaper of Metropolitan Council on Housing: \"Freeman was widely admired among tenant advocates for an unusual mix of impressive qualities: her intellect and insight, her personal dedication to ordinary people, her passion for their rights, and the depth, breadth, thoroughness, and accuracy of her research. She employed these in an unbroken series of actions and campaigns over three decades. Protective of her independence and integrity, and averse to bureaucracy, she almost always worked as a free agent or volunteer, even refusing paid positions for the same things she did freely.\"\n\nFreeman defended tenants whether in public housing or in private rentals threatened by predatory landlords and developers. She worked with Met Council, Cooper Square Committee, Good Old Lower East Side (GOLES), University Settlement, and the Coalition for a District Alternative (CoDA). She helped create the Lower East Side Coop Watch, a campaign to protect tenants from hazardous conditions created by landlords in illegal, coercive co-op conversions, resulting in DOB and HPD action to force repairs for tenants’safety. She also helped create the Croman Tenants Association, Justice for Lincoln Swados (Lincoln was a disabled man who died when his door was blocked during building renovations), was a founding member of the Lower East Side Coalition to Save Public Housing & Section 8 to mobilize and educate tenants, lead organizer of tenants in Extell owned buildings on the LES to prevent evictions, and worked for the City Wide Task Force for Housing.\n\nThrough her briefs and oral arguments she set the precedent that stipulations could include owner repairs to Department of Buildings and Environmental Control Board violations. For the 37 Spring Street Tenant Association, she represented the tenants in Housing Court. This case broke Housing Court precedent as the first time a landlord was mandated to correct not only HPD violations but also violations with DOB and DEP, allowing all tenants citywide to bring greater scrutiny in Housing Court to DOB failures in regulation.\n\nFor the 196 Elizabeth Street Freeman advised tenants who were displaced by a fire in their tenement building and were unable to regain their home when the landlord failed to rehabilitate the apartments as stipulated by the Court.\n\nFor the 167 Elizabeth Street she organized the tenants’ association within her own building when the landlord refused to make repairs and threatened residents who made complaints. Janet provided advice as to how to register complaints and set up a rent strike, while protecting the tenants’ rights under New York City Law. One of these repairs was for an elderly, top-floor tenant with a disabled adult daughter, who had not had running water in their toilet for three years. Freeman organized tenants in nine Croman-owned buildings in Little Italy to document violations and other conditions in preparation for legal action against the landlord, eventually creating a coalition with other Croman-owned building tenants on the Lower East Side, leading to a meeting with the NYS Attorney General about a general pattern of landlord harassment against long-term tenants. She saved the homes of dozens of individual Little Italy tenants facing eviction, providing her expertise on her own time.\n\nFreeman organized and helped individual tenants while also working at a macro level for policy change to preserve affordable housing, and was indispensable to local community organizations including Cooper Square Committee, Good Old Lower East Side (GOLES), Citywide Task Force on Housing (now Housing Court Answers), Metropolitan Council on Housing and Project Home at University Settlement. She assisted a 1995 Joint Planning Council study of displacement, surveying residents, mapping out strategies, doing tenant outreach and organizing buildings.\n\nFreeman organized low-income tenants in Little Italy, Chinatown and the Lower East Side in collaboration with Project Home at University Settlement, to inform them of their rights, help them fight evictions and illegal conversions, and to gain repairs to their buildings, often accompanying tenants to Court. She organized, trained, counseled and educated tenants coming to GOLES and Met Council as direct services to address displacement and other issues affecting low-income communities. As staff member of HCA, she advocated for Court reform and worked a table at Housing Court to provide information to hundreds of tenants facing eviction, often continuing to research details for individual tenants on her own time.\n\nFreeman's earliest effort was to help get trees planted on the street where she lived. Responding to the invasion of nightlife in Little Italy, Freeman mobilized the community, researching and arguing before the local community board. She also worked with the Houston/Broadway MTA Station fight and the DeSalvio Park renovation. When the neighborhood was threatened with a Las Vegas-style burlesque cabaret, she spearheaded the community's successful opposition. Freeman’s research identified application plans that failed to adhere to DOB and SLA regulations, nonconformance to Certificates of Occupancy, fire codes, work without permits, and ADA law. Working in collaboration with Sook Ling Lai, Director of UPK of NY Board of Education Chinatown Head Start and Robin Goldberg, now a CB2 Manhattan Board Member, she monitored new liquor license applications at CB2, informed and mobilized the community when these proposals were projected to be disruptive to neighbors.\n\nTo commemorate Freeman's concern for the people of Little Italy and the Lower East Side, Community Board 2 and the New York City Council, in conjunction with sponsors Chinatown Headstart, Housing Court Answers and Friends of Petrosino Square, co-named Elizabeth Street between Kenmare & Spring Streets \"Janet Freeman Way,\" June 20, 2013. Community Board 2's resolution to rename the street recognized Freeman for \"[a]dvocating for tenants’ rights and guiding and organizing tenants, in her building, on her block, and in her surrounding community, to successfully fight rapacious landlords and avoid eviction as well as fight violations and receive rightful repairs. Sharing her extensive knowledge of laws and research skills with tenants as well as advocacy and community organizations for guidance in their activities to help protect tenants and preserve affordable housing. Working with such groups as Cooper Sq. Committee, Good Old Lower East Side, Citywide Task Force on Housing (now Housing Court Answers), Metropolitan Council on Housing and Project Home (at the University Settlement) to both advocate for tenants and effect policy change. Organizing the Lower East Side Co-op Watch to protect tenants from hazardous conditions created by landlords in illegal, coercive co-op conversions. Organizing her neighborhood to fight an oversaturation of bars in the community, including defeat of a burlesque bar in a residential building at Kenmare and Elizabeth. Obtaining matching funds in the 1970s for the City to plant the now-mature trees on her Elizabeth St. block between Kenmare and Spring Sts. Mentoring the formation and organization of other community organizations with shared concerns, such as the Friends of Petrosino Park. Fighting and helping defeat a proposal for an MTA substation at the Houston-Broadway subway station...\".\n"}

A historian and geographer, he is regarded as one of the most productive authors of non-religious, scientific literature in the 17th-century Ottoman Empire.\n\nKâtip Çelebi was born as Mustafa, the son of an Abdullah, in Constantinople (Istanbul). He began his studies at the age of five or six, and became an apprentice in the Ottoman financial bureaucracy at the age of fourteen. As the accountant of the commissariat department of the Ottoman army in Anatolia, he accompanied the Ottoman army in the suppression of the rebellion of Abaza Mehmed Pasha in 1624, as well as during the Ottoman-Safavid War of 1629-1639, particularly in the campaigns at Baghdad in 1625, and at the siege of Erzurum. He returned to Constantinople in 1628. In the following year he was again in Baghdad and Hamadan, and in 1633-34 at Aleppo, whence he made the pilgrimage to Mecca (hence his title \"Hajji\"). The following year he was in Erivan and then returned to Constantinople. Here he obtained a post in the head office of the commissariat department, which afforded him time for study. An inheritance which he received in 1645 enabled him to live comfortably in the Ottoman capital of Constantinople and dedicate his time to scholarship. Kâtip Çelebi died untimely in 1657.\n\nMany of his works were composed between 1648 and his death in 1657. Among his best-known works is the \"Kashf al-ẓunūn ‘an asāmī al-kutub wa-al-funūn\", () (\"The Removal of Doubt from the Names of Books and the Arts\"), a bibliographic encyclopaedia, written in Arabic, which lists more than 14,500 books in alphabetic order.\n\nOne of his shorter and more accessible works is \"Mīzānü'l-ḥaḳḳ fī iḫtiyāri'l-aḥaḳḳ\" () (\"The balance of truth in the choice of the truest\"), a collection of short essays on topics in Islamic law, ethics, and theology, in which he takes a relatively liberal and tolerant view—often critical of narrow-minded Islamic religious authorities. This book serves as a source on Ottoman social developments in the 16th and 17th centuries, such as the introduction of coffee and tobacco. While he did not concur with the outlawing of coffee and tobacco, he found tobacco smoke personally distasteful, writing of the \"noxious effects of the corruption of the aerial essence.\" An English translation by G. L. Lewis of the \"Mīzān al-ḥaqq\" has been published with annotations under the title \"The Balance of Truth\".\n\nThere is a university named after him, İzmir Kâtip Çelebi University in İzmir. Turkey and the UK have an ongoing science and innovation exchange program called the Newton-Katip Çelebi Fund.\n\n"}

The kingdom takes its name from its historic capital, now the Burkinabé national capital of Ouagadougou. Although the most politically powerful of the Mossi Kingdoms, there was no Mossi \"empire\", and the Wogodogo king did not have authority over the other kingdoms. The French colonial period and subsequent independence have reduced the power vested in the position, but the Mogho Naba retains an influential role in Burkina Faso.\n\nThe position is typically hereditary, following male-only lines of descent. Originally, the position passed primarily to brothers (or even cousins), rather than to sons, but by the reign of Zombré had transitioned to its current order of succession, where rule generally passes to the eldest living son of the previous ruler. Children born to sons who predecease their fathers are not eligible to inherit the title. However, a council is ultimately responsible for selecting the Mogho Naba, and the heir apparent may be passed over if, for example, he is deemed physically unfit for the position's traditional role in war or if he would fail to uphold the dignity of the office (as in cases of adultery). This council has traditionally included: the \"baloum naba\", head of the king's servants; the \"gounga naba\", leader of the infantry; the \"larale naba\", keeper of the royal tombs; the \"kamsaogo naba\", manager of the palace eunuchs; and the \"widi naba\", the royal groom.\n\nThe list of the Moro Naba of Ouagadougou, as well as the time of reign, is recited every morning at the arrival of the Moro Naba and is known by the Bend Naba and the griots of the court.\n\nThe chronology of the Mossi Kingdoms prior to the French occupation is unclear. Historian Yamba Tiendrebeogo reconstructed the history of Wogodogo from Mossi oral tradition that included the lengths of the reigns of historical rulers. Other scholars propose more recent dates for many pre-colonial events—setting the start of Oubri's reign around 1495 rather than 1182—and correspondingly shorter reigns for many rulers.\n\nThe first Mossi Kingdom was centered around Tenkodogo. Wogodogo, initially a client state of Tenkodogo, gradually grew in power until it was the dominant political power in the Mossi Kingdoms; nevertheless, the rulers of Tenkodogo prior to the formation of Wogodogo are counted as kings of Wogodogo by tradition.\n\nThe first capitol of Oubritenga (\"Oubri's land\") was Guilongou, near modern-day Ziniaré, but typically moved to a village preferred by each new king upon his accession.\n\nNaba Zombré relocated the capitol to Wogodogo (Ouagadougou).\nIn 1958, Moro Naba Kougri wanted to impose a constitutional monarchy on Upper Volta but failed in his attempt. The present Moro Naba is Baongo II, son of Naba Kougri and Koudpoko.\n\nAccording to Titinga Frédéric Pacéré, in tradition, he is considered all powerful with right of life and death on the inhabitants of Ouagadougou and Oubritenga. In practice, his power was subject to the custom and law of the fathers. He personifies the empire and embodies its unity, but power is really in the hands of the court of the Moro Naba, ministers who make decisions and govern the country. This complex organisation of powers is materialised every Friday during the ceremony of the false departure of the king.\n\nThe Moro Naba has no authority over the other kingdoms of Tenkodogo, Fada N'Gourma, Boussouma and Ouahigouya, whose sovereigns would be, like him, descendants of Yennenga.\n\nTraditionally, the rulers of these four kingdoms and the Ouagadougou Mogho Naba avoid each other, but they happen to meet, such as happened in 1946 to consult on the reconstruction of the Upper Volta.\n\n"}

Bang credited the inspiration for the metaphor to his wife, Alison Coombe Bang, a nursing sister, who mentioned the term during her midwifery studies. Bang's research, through the University of Cape Town, was done on a limited budget and with rudimentary equipment, yet his studies using closely spaced bathythermograph readings, were later corroborated by satellite thermal imagery. The term was then revived and is now common parlance among oceanographers. The Agulhas current's retroflection is now key to an understanding of its dynamics.\n\nThe North Brazil Current (NBC) is a western boundary current that flows off the coast of northeast Brazil, in the tropical Atlantic that transports upper ocean waters across the equator. It retroflects between 4°N and 10°N. Particularly during summer and fall, the NBC retroflects from the coast at 6° to 7°N and feeds the North Equatorial Countercurrent and North Equatorial Undercurrent. The NBC sheds large anticyclonic rings that move northwestward along the continental break. (Didden and Schott, 1993). These warm rings could play an important role in the net meridional transport of warm water in the upper layers of the Atlantic Ocean as part of the meridional overturning circulation (MOC).\n\nIn the southeast Atlantic Ocean the current \"retroflects\" (turns back on itself) in the Agulhas Retroflection due to shear interactions with the strong Antarctic Circumpolar Current. This water becomes the Agulhas Return Current, rejoining the Indian Ocean Gyre. It is estimated that up to 85 Sv (Sverdrups) of the net transport is returned to the Indian Ocean through the retroflection. The remaining water is transported into the South Atlantic Gyre in the Agulhas Leakage. Along with direct branch currents, this leakage takes place in surface water filaments, and Agulhas Eddies.\n"}

Sector lights are most often used for safe passage through shallow or dangerous waters. This may be when leaving or entering harbour. Nautical charts (paper and electronic) give all the required information.\n\nSectors of colored glass (or plastic) are placed in the lanterns of these lights. The light will then show these colors when observed certain bearings. Bearings referring to a sector are given in degrees true as observed from sea. Though the colors of the light will change, the characteristics will not. The change of color is not abrupt. The transition is made through an arc of uncertainty of 2° or greater.\n\nThe colors that are used, are conform to the IALA Maritime Bouyage system that is designed by the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities:\nA ship that is sailing in safe water and then sees the red (or green) color of the light has to make an alteration in course.\n\nThe world has different navigation stereotypes managed by IALA (International Association of Lighthouse Authorities). For example, the United States uses a signalling stereotype which is the opposite of Europe. In USA, the red light indicates the starboard side of the channel for harbour bound vessels, while the green light indicates the port side of the same channel. An expression to remind of this is \"red right returning\".\nAn example of a sector light is the light of the Fisgard Lighthouse in British Columbia. The lighthouse as built to guide ships through the entrance of Esquimalt harbour. The white sector is an isophase light of 2s from 322° to 195°. If the ship sees this white light, it can pass safely. The rest shows a red light from 195 to 322°. If a vessel sees this light, it should alter its course.\n\nAnother example is the PEL sector light at Diego Garcia. The PEL sector light was constructed to guide US Navy vessels into the Diego Garcia port through a narrow entrance in the lagoon. The PEL sector light produces 3.5 million candela and is visible for 10 nautical miles (18.5 km) by day. The beam with 3 colors is narrow at 1.6°. This was required because the PEL sector light was built over 7NM (13 km) from the atoll entrance and it had to illuminate a safe entrance which is only 228 meters wide.\n"}

It is the most popular way to display and navigate maps, replacing other methods such as WMS which typically display a single large image, with arrow buttons to navigate to nearby areas. Google Maps was one of the first major mapping sites to use this technique. Tiled web maps may in turn be replaced by vector tiles as the standard.\n\nThere are several major advantages to tiled maps. Each time the user pans, most of the tiles are still relevant, and can be kept displayed, while new tiles are fetched. This greatly improves the user experience, compared to fetching a single map image for the whole viewport. It also allows individual tiles to be pre-computed, a task easy to parallelize. Also, displaying rendered images served from a web server is much less computationally demanding than rendering images in the browser, a benefit over technologies such as WFS. While many map tiles are in raster format (a bitmap file such as PNG or JPG), the number of suppliers of vector tiles is growing. The advantage of vector tiles is that each client (browser) can apply a custom style to the map. In such a case the actual map tile pixels are rendered by the browser. Another advantage is that the client can decide to rotate the map without all text labels becoming unreadable, as the labels don't rotate.\n\nProperties of tiled web maps that require convention or standards include the size of tiles, the numbering of zoom levels, the projection to use, the way individual tiles are numbered or otherwise identified, and the method for requesting them.\n\nMost tiled web maps follow certain Google Maps conventions:\n\n\nThe de facto OpenStreetMap standard, known as Slippy Map Tilenames or XYZ, follows these and adds more:\n\nThere are three main numbering schemes in use:\n\nSeveral standards exist:\n\nTo display a tiled map in a browser usually requires the support of a web mapping framework. This framework handles the retrieval of tiles, display, caching, and user navigation. Popular frameworks for tiled maps include Google Maps API, OpenLayers and Leaflet.\n\n"}

Other names for \"town square\" are \"civic center\", \"city square\", \"urban square\", \"market square\", \"public square\", \"piazza\", \"plaza\", and \"town green\".\n\nMost town squares are hardscapes suitable for open markets, concerts, political rallies, and other events that require firm ground. Being centrally located, town squares are usually surrounded by small shops such as bakeries, meat markets, cheese stores, and clothing stores. At their center is often a fountain, well, monument, or statue. Many of those with fountains are actually called fountain square.\n\nIn urban planning, a city square or urban square is a planned open area in a city.\n\nIn Mainland China, People's Square is a common designation for the central town square of modern Chinese cities, established as part of urban modernization within the last few decades. These squares are the site of government buildings, museums and other public buildings. The probably best-known and largest such square in China is Tienanmen Square.\n\nThe German word for square is Platz, which also means \"Place\", and is a common term for central squares in German-speaking countries. These have been focal points of public life in towns and cities from the Middle Ages to today. Squares located opposite a Palace or Castle () are commonly named Schlossplatz. Prominent \"Plätze\" include the Alexanderplatz, Pariser Platz and Potsdamer Platz in Berlin, Heldenplatz in Vienna, and the Königsplatz in Munich.\n\nA piazza () is a city square in Italy, Malta, along the Dalmatian coast and in surrounding regions. San Marco in Venice may be the worlds best known. The term is roughly equivalent to the Spanish \"plaza\". In Ethiopia, it is used to refer to a part of a city.\n\nWhen the Earl of Bedford developed Covent Garden – the first private-venture public square built in London – his architect Inigo Jones surrounded it with arcades, in the Italian fashion. Talk about the \"piazza\" was connected in Londoners' minds not with the square as a whole, but with the arcades.\n\nA piazza is commonly found at the meeting of two or more streets. Most Italian cities have several piazzas with streets radiating from the center. Shops and other small businesses are found on piazzas as it is an ideal place to set up a business. Many metro stations and bus stops are found on piazzas as they are key point in a city.\n\nIn Britain, \"piazza\" now generally refers to a paved open pedestrian space, without grass or planting, often in front of a significant building or shops. King's Cross station in London is to have a piazza as part of its redevelopment. The piazza will replace the existing 1970s concourse and allow the original 1850s façade to be seen again. There is a good example of a piazza in Scotswood at Newcastle College.\n\nIn the United States, in the early 19th century, a \"piazza\" by further extension became a fanciful name for a colonnaded porch. Piazza was used by some, especially in the Boston area, to refer to a verandah or front porch of a house or apartment.\n\nA central square just off Gibraltar's Main Street, between the Parliament Building and the City Hall officially named \"John Mackintosh Square\" is colloquially referred to as \"The Piazza\".\n\nA large open square common in villages, towns and cities of Indonesia is known as \"alun-alun\". It is a Javanese term which in modern-day Indonesia refers to the two large open squares of kraton compounds. It is typically located adjacent a mosque or a palace. It is a place for public spectacles, court celebrations and general non-court entertainments.\n\nIn traditional Persian architecture, town squares are known as maydan or meydan. A maydan is considered as one of the essential features in urban planning and they are often adjacent to bazaars, large mosques and other public buildings. Naqsh-e Jahan Square in Isfahan and Azadi Square in Tehran are examples of classic and modern squares.\n\nSquares are often called \"markt\" because of the usage of the square as a market place. Almost every town in Belgium and the southern part of the Netherlands has a \"Grote Markt\" (for example \"Grote Markt\" in Brussels) or \"Grand Place\" in French. The \"Grote Markt\" is often the place where the town hall is situated and therefore the centre of the town.\n\nThe same naming can be found in surrounding regions as for example Cologne has several central squares named \"-markt\" or \"Markt\" (Heumarkt, Neumarkt, Alter Markt).\n\nIn Russia, \"central square\" (, romanised: \"tsentráĺnaya plóshchad́\") is a common term for an open area in the heart of the town. In a number of cities this square does not have an individual name, i.e., officially named so: Tsentráĺnaya Plóshchad́ (Central Square), e.g., Central Square (Tolyatti); see for more.\n\nThroughout Spain, Spanish America, and the Spanish East Indies, the plaza mayor of each center of administration held three closely related institutions: the cathedral, the cabildo or administrative center, which might be incorporated in a wing of a governor's palace, and the audiencia or law court. The plaza remains a center of community life that is only equaled by the market-place. This open space at the center of the cities is originally from the Mediterranean where public spaces always had very important role for public life. The origin of the word Plaza is, via Latin platea, from Greek πλατεῖα (ὁδός) plateia (hodos), meaning \"broad (way or street)\". The Plaza is the heir to the Roman \"Forum\", and this is the heir of the Greek (Agora). \nMost viceregal cities in Spanish America and the Philippines were planned around a square \"plaza de armas\", where troops could be mustered, as the name implies, surrounded by the governor's palace and the main church. \nIn the United Kingdom, and especially in London and Edinburgh, a \"square\" has a wider meaning. There are public squares of the type described above but the term is also used for formal open spaces surrounded by houses with private gardens at the centre, sometimes known as garden squares. Most of these were built in the 18th and 19th centuries. In some cases the gardens are now open to the public. See the category. Additionally, many public squares were created in towns and cities across the UK as part of urban redevelopment following the Blitz. Squares can also be quite small and resemble courtyards, especially in the City of London. In Halifax, the recently restored Piece Hall has been described a Piazza rivalling many in Europe.\n\nIn some cities, especially in New England, the term \"square\" (as its Spanish equivalent, \"Plaza\") is applied to a commercial area (like Central Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts), usually formed around the intersection of three or more streets, and which originally consisted of some open area (many of which have been filled in with traffic islands and other traffic calming features). Many of these intersections are irregular rather than square.\n\nIn newer cities that have been planned mostly around the use of automobiles, public squares are rare and tend to be limited to the older central districts. The social utility of such public spaces can be severely curtailed by the high cost of downtown parking; at the same time, the high demand for parking has historically led to the proliferation of street-level parking lots which has further diminished the potential availability of open pedestrian space. Another deterrent is the perception of the urban core as a particularly dangerous crime center, whether the notion is justified or not.\n\nThroughout North America, words like \"place\", \"square\", or \"plaza\" frequently appear in the names of commercial developments such shopping centers and hotels.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "295670", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=295670", "title": "Urban ecology", "text": "Urban ecology\n\nUrban ecology is the scientific study of the relation of living organisms with each other and their surroundings in the context of an urban environment. The urban environment refers to environments dominated by high-density residential and commercial buildings, paved surfaces, and other urban-related factors that create a unique landscape dissimilar to most previously studied environments in the field of ecology.\n\nUrban ecology is a recent field of study compared to ecology as a whole. The methods and studies of urban ecology are similar to and comprise a subset of ecology. The study of urban ecology carries increasing importance because more than 50% of the world's population today lives in urban areas. At the same time, it is estimated that within the next forty years, two-thirds of the world's population will be living in expanding urban centers. The ecological processes in the urban environment are comparable to those outside the urban context. However, the types of urban habitats and the species that inhabit them are poorly documented. Often, explanations for phenomena examined in the urban setting as well as predicting changes because of urbanization are the center for scientific research.\n\nEcology has historically focused on \"pristine\" natural environments, but by the 1970s many ecologists began to turn their interest towards ecological interactions taking place in, and caused by urban environments. Jean-Marie Pelt's 1977 book \"The Re-Naturalized Human\", Brian Davis' 1978 publication \"Urbanization and the diversity of insects\", and Sukopp et al.'s 1979 article \"The soil, flora and vegetation of Berlin's wastelands\" are some of the first publications to recognize the importance of urban ecology as a separate and distinct form of ecology the same way one might see landscape ecology as different from population ecology. Forman and Godron's 1986 book \"Landscape Ecology\" first distinguished urban settings and landscapes from other landscapes by dividing all landscapes into five broad types. These types were divided by the intensity of human influence ranging from pristine natural environments to urban centers.\n\nUrban ecology is recognized as a diverse and complex concept which differs in application between North America and Europe. The European concept of urban ecology examines the biota of urban areas, while the North American concept has traditionally examined the social sciences of the urban landscape, as well as the ecosystem fluxes and processes.\n\nSince urban ecology is a subfield of ecology, many of the techniques are similar to that of ecology. Ecological study techniques have been developed over centuries, but many of the techniques use for urban ecology are more recently developed. Methods used for studying urban ecology involve chemical and biochemical techniques, temperature recording, heat mapping remote sensing, and long-term ecological research sites.\n\nChemical techniques may be used to determine pollutant concentrations and their effects. Tests can be as simple as dipping a manufactured test strip, as in the case of pH testing, or be more complex, as in the case of examining the spatial and temporal variation of heavy metal contamination due to industrial runoff. In that particular study, livers of birds from many regions of the North Sea were ground up and mercury was extracted. Additionally, mercury bound in feathers was extracted from both live birds and from museum specimens to test for mercury levels across many decades. Through these two different measurements, researchers were able to make a complex picture of the spread of mercury due to industrial runoff both spatially and temporally.\n\nOther chemical techniques include tests for nitrates, phosphates, sulfates, etc. which are commonly associated with urban pollutants such as fertilizer and industrial byproducts. These biochemical fluxes are studied in the atmosphere (e.g. greenhouse gasses), aquatic ecosystems and soil vegetation. Broad reaching effects of these biochemical fluxes can be seen in various aspects of both the urban and surrounding rural ecosystems.\n\nTemperature data can be used for various kinds of studies. An important aspect of temperature data is the ability to correlate temperature with various factors that may be affecting or occurring in the environment. Oftentimes, temperature data is collected long-term by the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR), and made available to the scientific community through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Data can be overlaid with maps of terrain, urban features, and other spatial areas to create heat maps. These heat maps can be used to view trends and distribution over time and space.\n\nRemote sensing is the technique in which data is collected from distant locations through the use of satellite imaging, radar, and aerial photographs. In urban ecology, remote sensing is used to collect data about terrain, weather patterns, light, and vegetation. One application of remote sensing for urban ecology is to detect the productivity of an area by measuring the photosynthetic wavelengths of emitted light. Satellite images can also be used to detect differences in temperature and landscape diversity to detect the effects of urbanization.\n\nLong-term ecological research (LTER) sites are research sites funded by the government that have collected reliable long-term data over an extended period of time in order to identify long-term climatic or ecological trends. These sites provide long-term temporal and spatial data such as average temperature, rainfall and other ecological processes. The main purpose of LTERs for urban ecologists is the collection of vast amounts of data over long periods of time. These long-term data sets can then be analyzed to find trends relating to the effects of the urban environment on various ecological processes, such as species diversity and abundance over time. Another example is the examination of temperature trends that are accompanied with the growth of urban centers.\n\nHumans are the driving force behind urban ecology and influence the environment in a variety of ways, such as modifying land surfaces and waterways, introducing foreign species, and altering biogeochemical cycles. Some of these effects are more apparent, such as the reversal of the Chicago River to accommodate the growing pollution levels and trade on the river. Other effects can be more gradual such as the change in global climate due to urbanization.\n\nHumans place high demand on land not only to build urban centers, but also to build surrounding suburban areas for housing. Land is also allocated for agriculture to sustain the growing population of the city. Expanding cities and suburban areas necessitate corresponding deforestation to meet the land-use and resource requirements of urbanization. Key examples of this are Deforestation in the United States and Brazil.\n\nAlong with manipulation of land to suit human needs, natural water resources such as rivers and streams are also modified in urban establishments. Modification can come in the form of dams, artificial canals, and even the reversal of rivers. Reversing the flow of the Chicago River is a major example of urban environmental modification. Urban areas in natural desert settings often bring in water from far areas to maintain the human population and will likely have effects on the local desert climate. Modification of aquatic systems in urban areas also results in decreased stream diversity and increased pollution.\n\nBoth local shipping and long-distance trade are required to meet the resource demands important in maintaining urban areas. Carbon dioxide emissions from the transport of goods also contribute to accumulating greenhouse gases and nutrient deposits in the soil and air of urban environments. In addition, shipping facilitates the unintentional spread of living organisms, and introduces them to environments that they would not naturally inhabit. Introduced or alien species are populations of organisms living in a range in which they did not naturally evolve due to intentional or inadvertent human activity. Increased transportation between urban centers furthers the incidental movement of animal and plant species. Alien species often have no natural predators and pose a substantial threat to the dynamics of existing ecological populations in the new environment where they are introduced. Such invasive species are numerous and include house sparrows, ring-necked pheasants, European starlings, brown rats, Asian carp, American bullfrogs, emerald ash borer, kudzu vines, and zebra mussels among numerous others, most notably domesticated animals. In Australia, it has been found that removing Lantana (\"L. camara,\" an alien species) from urban greenspaces can surprisingly have negative impacts on bird diversity locally, as it provides refugia for species like the superb fairy (Malurus cyaneus) and silvereye (Zosterops lateralis), in the absence of native plant equivalents . Although, there seems to be a density threshold in which too much Lantana (thus homogeneity in vegetation cover) can lead to a decrease in bird species richness or abundance .\n\nUrbanization results in a large demand for chemical use by industry, construction, agriculture, and energy providing services. Such demands have a substantial impact on biogeochemical cycles, resulting in phenomena such as acid rain, eutrophication, and global warming. Furthermore, natural biogeochemical cycles in the urban environment can be impeded due to impermeable surfaces that prevent nutrients from returning to the soil, water, and atmosphere.\nDemand for fertilizers to meet agricultural needs exerted by expanding urban centers can alter chemical composition of soil. Such effects often result in abnormally high concentrations of compounds including sulfur, phosphorus, nitrogen, and heavy metals. In addition, nitrogen and phosphorus used in fertilizers have caused severe problems in the form of agricultural runoff, which alters the concentration of these compounds in local rivers and streams, often resulting in adverse effects on native species. A well-known effect of agricultural runoff is the phenomenon of eutrophication. When the fertilizer chemicals from agricultural runoff reach the ocean, an algal bloom results, then rapidly dies off. The dead algae biomass is decomposed by bacteria that also consume large quantities of oxygen, which they obtain from the water, creating a \"dead zone\" without oxygen for fish or other organisms. A classic example is the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico due to agricultural runoff into the Mississippi River.\n\nJust as pollutants and alterations in the biogeochemical cycle alter river and ocean ecosystems, they exert likewise effects in the air. Smog stems from the accumulation of chemicals and pollution and often manifests in urban settings, which has a great impact on local plants and animals. Because urban centers are often considered point sources for pollution, unsurprisingly local plants have adapted to withstand such conditions.\n\nUrban environments and outlying areas have been found to exhibit unique local temperatures, precipitation, and other characteristic activity due to a variety of factors such as pollution and altered geochemical cycles. Some examples of the urban effects on climate are urban heat island, oasis effect, greenhouse gases, and acid rain. This further stirs the debate as to whether urban areas should be considered a unique biome. Despite common trends among all urban centers, the surrounding local environment heavily influences much of the climate. One such example of regional differences can be seen through the urban heat island and oasis effect.\n\nThe urban heat island is a phenomenon in which central regions of urban centers exhibit higher mean temperatures than surrounding urban areas. Much of this effect can be attributed to low city albedo, the reflecting power of a surface, and the increased surface area of buildings to absorb solar radiation. Concrete, cement, and metal surfaces in urban areas tend to absorb heat energy rather than reflect it, contributing to higher urban temperatures. Brazel et al. found that the urban heat island effect demonstrates a positive correlation with population density in the city of Baltimore. The heat island effect has corresponding ecological consequences on resident species. However, this effect has only been seen in temperate climates.\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions include those of carbon dioxide and methane from the combustion of fossil fuels to supply energy needed by vast urban metropolises. Other greenhouse gases include water vapor, and nitrous oxide. Increases in greenhouse gases due to urban transport, construction, industry and other demands have been correlated strongly with increase in temperature. Sources of methane are agricultural dairy cows and landfills.\n\nProcesses related to urban areas result in the emission of numerous pollutants, which change corresponding nutrient cycles of carbon, sulfur, nitrogen, and other elements. Ecosystems in and around the urban center are especially influenced by these point sources of pollution. High sulfur dioxide concentrations resulting from the industrial demands of urbanization cause rainwater to become more acidic. Such an effect has been found to have a significant influence on locally affected populations, especially in aquatic environments. Wastes from urban centers, especially large urban centers in developed nations, can drive biogeochemical cycles on a global scale.\n\nThe urban environment has been classified as an anthropogenic biome, which is characterized by the predominance of certain species and climate trends such as urban heat island across many urban areas. Examples of species characteristic of many urban environments include, cats, dogs, mosquitoes, rats, flies, and pigeons, which are all generalists. Many of these are dependent on human activity and have adapted accordingly to the niche created by urban centers.\n\nResearch thus far indicates that, on a small scale, urbanization often increases the biodiversity of non-native species while reducing that of native species. This normally results in an overall reduction in species richness and increase in total biomass and species abundance. Urbanization also reduces diversity on a large scale.\n\nUrban stream syndrome is a consistently observed trait of urbanization characterized by high nutrient and contaminant concentration, altered stream morphology, increased dominance of dominant species, and decreased biodiversity The two primary causes of urban stream syndrome are storm water runoff and wastewater treatment plant effluent.\n\nDiversity is normally reduced at intermediate-low levels of urbanization but is always reduced at high levels of urbanization. These effects have been observed in vertebrates and invertebrates while plant species tend to increase with intermediate-low levels of urbanization but these general trends do not apply to all organisms within those groups. For example, McKinney’s (2006) review did not include the effects of urbanization on fishes and of the 58 studies on invertebrates, 52 included insects while only 10 included spiders. There is also a geographical bias as most of the studies either took place in North America or Europe.\n\nThe effects of urbanization also depend on the type and range of resources used by the organism. Generalist species, those that use a wide range of resources and can thrive under a large range of living conditions, are likely survive in uniform environments. Specialist species, those that use a narrow range of resources and can only cope with a narrow range of living conditions, are unlikely to cope with uniform environments. There will likely be a variable effect on these two groups of organisms as urbanization alters habitat uniformity.\n\nThe urban environment can decrease diversity through habitat removal and species homogenization - the increasing similarity between two previously distinct biological communities. Habitat degradation and habitat fragmentation reduces the amount of suitable habitat by urban development and separates suitable patches by inhospitable terrain such as roads, neighborhoods, and open parks. Although this replacement of suitable habitat with unsuitable habitat will result in extinctions of native species, some shelter may be artificially created and promote the survival of non-native species (e.g. house sparrow and house mice nests). Urbanization promotes species homogenization through the extinction of native endemic species and the introduction of non-native species that already have a widespread abundance. Changes to the habitat may promote both the extinction of native endemic species and the introduction of non-native species. The effects of habitat change will likely be similar in all urban environments as urban environments are all built to cater to the needs of humans.\n\nThe urban environment can also increase diversity in a number of ways. Many foreign organisms are introduced and dispersed naturally or artificially in urban areas. Artificial introductions may be intentional, where organisms have some form of human use, or accidental, where organisms attach themselves to transportation vehicles. Humans provide food sources (e.g. birdfeeder seeds, trash, garden compost) and reduce the numbers of large natural predators in urban environments, allowing large populations to be supported where food and predation would normally limit the population size. There are a variety of different habitats available within the urban environment as a result of differences in land use allowing for more species to be supported than by more uniform habitats.\n\nCities should be planned and constructed in such a way that minimizes the urban effects on the surrounding environment (urban heat island, precipitation, etc.) as well as optimizing ecological activity. For example, increasing the albedo, or reflective power, of surfaces in urban areas, can minimize urban heat island, resulting in a lower magnitude of the urban heat island effect in urban areas. By minimizing these abnormal temperature trends and others, ecological activity would likely be improved in the urban setting.\n\nUrbanization has indeed had a profound effect on the environment, on both local and global scales. Difficulties in actively constructing habitat corridor and returning biogeochemical cycles to normal raise the question as to whether such goals are feasible. However, some groups are working to return areas of land affected by the urban landscape to a more natural state. This includes using landscape architecture to model natural systems and restore rivers to pre-urban states.\n\nWith the ever-increasing demands for resources necessitated by urbanization, recent campaigns to move toward sustainable energy and resource consumption, such as LEED certification of buildings, Energy Star certified appliances, and zero emission vehicles, have gained momentum. Sustainability reflects techniques and consumption ensuring reasonably low resource use as a component of urban ecology. Techniques such as carbon recapture may also be used to sequester carbon compounds produced in urban centers rather continually emitting more of the greenhouse gas.\n\nUrbanization results in a series of both local and far-reaching effects on biodiversity, biogeochemical cycles, hydrology, and climate, among many other stresses. Many of these effects are not fully understood, as urban ecology has only recently emerged as a scientific discipline and much more research remains to be done. Research on cities outside the US and Europe remains limited. Observations on the impact of urbanization on biodiversity and species interactions are consistent across many studies but definitive mechanisms have yet to be established. Urban ecology constitutes an important and highly relevant subfield of ecology, and further study must be pursued to more fully understand the effects of human urban areas on the environment.\n"}
{"id": "2382802", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2382802", "title": "Yungas", "text": "Yungas\n\nThe Yungas (Aymara \"yunka\" warm or temperate Andes or earth, Quechua \"yunka\" warm area on the slopes of the Andes) is a narrow band of forest along the eastern slope of the Andes Mountains from Peru, Bolivia, and northern Argentina. It is a transitional zone between the Andean highlands and the eastern forests. Like the surrounding areas, the Yungas belong to the Neotropic ecozone; the climate is rainy, humid, and warm.\n\nThe Yungas forests are extremely diverse, ranging from moist lowland forest to evergreen montane forest and cloud forests. The terrain, formed by valleys, fluvial mountain trails and streams, is extremely rugged and varied, contributing to the ecological diversity and richness. A complex mosaic of habitats occur with changing latitude as well as elevation. There are high levels of biodiversity and species endemism throughout the Yungas regions. Many of the forests are evergreen, and the South Andean Yungas contains what may be the last evergreen forests resulting from Quaternary glaciations.\n\nThe World Wide Fund for Nature has delineated three yungas ecoregions along the eastern side of the Andes:\n\nYungas are transitional zones between the Andean highlands and the eastern forests. The yungas forests are extremely diverse, ranging from moist lowland forest to evergreen montane forest and cloud forests. The terrain is extremely rugged and varied, contributing to the ecological diversity and richness. A complex mosaic of habitats occur with changing latitude as well as elevation. There are high levels of biodiversity and species endemism throughout the yungas regions. Many of the forests are evergreen, and the South Andean Yungas contains what may be the last evergreen forests resulting from Quaternary glaciations.\n\nThe average temperature is 72°F (22 °C). The climate is varied and ranges from a humid tropical to the cold of the Andes over 10,000 ft (3,000 m).\n\nIn Peru there is a difference between Yunga and Yungas. Yunga is considered a natural region on both sides of the Peruvian Andes, the western side towards the coast is called Sea Yunga, and the eastern side into the jungle is called Fluvial Yunga, both reach a height of 2,300 m.\n\nInstead, Yungas is the ecoregion of rain forest and montane forest from 1.000 to 3.500 m, so it is limited to the eastern side of the Andes. This concept has a closer analogy with the Bolivian Yungas. This region is considered as the most endemic biodiversity of Peru.\n\nForest loss in the Peruvian Yungas has sharply accelerated since the 2000s, rising seven-fold between 2005 and late 2012, according to satellite analysis by Terra-i.\n\nSea Yunga, or Maritime Yunga, is found between 500 and 2,300 m and it is situated between the eastern part of the coastal strip and the western part of the Highlands. This subregion has a subtropical desert climate with little rainfall along the central and southern coast (drier as you go south). The average year round day temperature is (max 33 °C min 8 °C). A mist-fed ecosystem called Lomas is found at scattered locations among hills near the Pacific Ocean at elevations up to . \n\nThe flora in the central Sea Yungas region is mainly composed by the lucuma and chirimoya trees, the casuarin and others.\n\nOnce you go north its climate becomes subtropical in the vicinity of La Libertad, Lambayeque and Piura. Day time temperatures average between and depending on latitude (max 40 °C min 15 °C).\n\nAs this area approaches the tropics, fauna differs from the rest of the coast, so that animals like the boas, larger reptiles and the famous white-winged guan (a bird species unique to this Peruvian ecoregion) occur here. Common trees in this area are the faique, the zapote, the zapayal, the \"barrigon\" and other thorny tropical savanna trees of the equatorial dry forests on the northern coast of Piura and Tumbes.\n\nThe cooler Pacific side is more vaguely characterized. The dry and cool \"Yunga Costal\" begins at 500 m above sea level. The Maritime Yunga begins dry, and it seems to follow ecotone on ecotone until reaching the Quechua region at the Pacific side.\n\nFluvial Yunga is between the altitudes of and and is found on the eastern part of Peru. This sub-region has a subtropical climate with ample seasonal rains. The average temperature fluctuates between 20 °C and 25 °C depending on the altitude (max 35 °C, min 11 °C).\n\nConcept:\n\nThe concept of the east side of the continental divide is straightforward: 1,000 m above sea level it is 4.9 °C cooler, and the subtropical cloud forest (Fluvial Yunga) follows the tropical rainforest (Anti). At 2,300 m, the climate transitions from subtropical climate to temperate climate (Quechua). The Tree line ends at 3,500 m and has an annual mean temperature of 10 °C. The region between the tree line and 4,000 m is called Suni or Jalca. Suni is a dry and cold region with many glacial valleys. Despite the harsh weather, crops such as quinoa, maca, qañiwa, broad beans and ulluku are cultivated here.\n\nThe flora (subtropical cloud forest) of the Yunga region is mainly composed by the Peruvian pepper tree, the Furcraea, white cabuya (Furcraea andina), the pitahaya and the Peruvian torch cactus (\"Echinopsis peruviana\"). The coca leaf is established in this region as well as the uña de gato (\"cat's claw\", \"Uncaria tomentosa\"). The most attractive sites of this warm refreshing region are its many orchid forests and beautiful valleys. The fauna in the Yunga region is characterized by the long-tailed mockingbird, or chaucato.\n\nAndean Continental Divide\n\nMountain Top:\n\n\nIn the early 20th century, the region was a major source for rubber and quinine. Now, coffee, citrus, and coca are important crops. People cultivate native plants like the canistel or eggfruit tree the lúcuma tree, the cherimoya or chirimoya, the guava or guayabo and the avocado or palta.\n\nThe Afro Bolivian community is concentrated here.\n\nThe Yungas Cocalera Revolution is based in the region. Its name derives from the one applied for the same mountain level by those who study the economic system of the prehispanic Andes.\nThe Yungas also bear the most dangerous road in the world, called the \"camino de la muerte,\" or Highway of Death.\n\nDue to the mountainous terrain an entrepreneurial coca harvester created a network of zip lines that permit rapid travel from peak to peak by farmers, referred to locally as flying men or bird men, along with their harvests using zip line trollies.\n\n\n"}
