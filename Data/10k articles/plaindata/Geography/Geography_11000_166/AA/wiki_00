{"id": "8215483", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8215483", "title": "A146 road", "text": "A146 road\n\nThe A146 is an A road that connects Norwich in Norfolk and Lowestoft in Suffolk, two of East Anglia's largest population centres. It is around in length and has primary classification along its entire route. It is mainly single carriageway throughout its route, with the exception of a section of dual carriageway on the southern edge of Norwich.\n\nThe A146 begins in Norwich before passing through a mainly rural area on its route to the eastern edge of Lowestoft.\n\nThe A146 starts to the south of Norwich city centre as part of the city ring road. It begins at a junction with the A140 Ipswich Road and forms a section of the ring road which is approximately long, running to the east where it reaches a junction with the A1054. The A146 then runs south-easterly out of the city, a direction it generally continues in for the rest of its route, initially as a section of dual carriageway around in length, crossing the main Norwich to London railway line and the River Yare and bypassing the village of Trowse. The road passes under the A47 southern bypass with junctions controlled by traffic lights allowing access to and from the A47 and reaches a junction with the B1332, the former northern terminus of the A144.\n\nBefore the construction of the southern bypass the A146 began in the centre of Norwich and ran through Trowse.\n\nAfter leaving Norwich the A146 returns to a single carriageway and runs through a rural section towards the town of Beccles on the Norfolk-Suffolk border. It passes through the parish of Hellington before reaching the village of Thurton where a speed limit is in force. After passing the grounds of Langley School it then bypasses the village of Chedgrave and the market town of Loddon, crossing the River Chet in the process. The route formerly passed through both of these settlements.\n\nThe road then passes the edge of the village of Hales at the junction of the B1136 for Great Yarmouth. Between Hales and Stockton several old stretches of the route can be seen in what are now laybys. It then reaches the A143 at a roundabout with the route to Bungay going west. The road briefly becomes the A143 for around before another roundabout on the northern edge of Gillingham where the A143 continues to the north-east towards Great Yarmouth. A service station and fast food restaurant are located at this junction.\n\nThe road then bypasses Gillingham and crosses the River Waveney, passing into Suffolk, before reaching the northern edge of the market town of Beccles at a roundabout with the A145. It formerly passed through Gillingham and crossed the Waveney at the narrow Beccles Old Bridge before passing through the town and Worlingham to the east.\n\nThe road passes to the north of Beccles and crosses the Lowestoft to Ipswich railway line at a level crossing. It passes Beccles Common and to the north of Worlingham, travelling now in a more easterly direction before rejoining its original route near the villages of North Cove and Barnby. Both villages are bypassed to the south by the modern road before it reaches the edge of the Lowestoft built up area at Carlton Colville. A relief road, the A1145, links Carlton Colville with the centre of Lowestoft whilst the A146 continues east.\n\nThe road terminates at a junction with the A1117 in Oulton Broad, just to the south of Oulton Broad South railway station. The road previously ended at a junction with the A12 in the centre of Lowestoft.\n\nThe A146 formerly started in Norwich city centre and ran into the centre of Lowestoft. A range of improvements, including straightening of bends, have taken place over the years. Chedgrave and Loddon were bypassed in the 1970s. Beccles, Worlingham and Gillingham are also bypassed with the River Waveney crossed by Beccles New Bridge, replacing a 19th century iron bridge which traffic used to have to cross in Beccles. The completion of the A47 Norwich southern bypass in 1992 created the dual carriageway section of the A146 on the edge of the city and bypassed the village of Trowse.\n\nThe A146 historically ran from Oulton Broad into the centre of Lowestoft along the route of what is today the B1531. The route ran to the south of Lake Lothing and terminated just to the south of the bascule bridge at a junction with the A12 immediately to the south of the entrance to the Port of Lowestoft.\n\nThe route of the A146 passes near to Norwich railway station on the Great Eastern Main Line and both Beccles railway station and Oulton Broad South railway station on the East Suffolk Line. All stations are operated by Abellio Greater Anglia\n\nThe First Norfolk & Suffolk X2 bus route also follows the road for much of its journey between Norwich and Lowestoft, serving all population centres on the route.\n\n"}

{"id": "289860", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=289860", "title": "Alignments of random points", "text": "Alignments of random points\n\nAlignments of random points in the plane can be demonstrated by statistics to be counter-intuitively easy to find when a large number of random points are marked on a bounded flat surface. This has been put forward as a demonstration that ley lines and other similar mysterious alignments believed by some to be phenomena of deep significance might exist solely due to chance alone, as opposed to the supernatural or anthropological explanations put forward by their proponents. The topic has also been studied in the fields of computer vision and astronomy.\n\nA number of studies have examined the mathematics of alignment of random points on the plane. In all of these, the width of the line - the allowed displacement of the positions of the points from a perfect straight line - is important. It allows the fact that real-world features are not mathematical points, and that their positions need not line up exactly for them to be considered in alignment. Alfred Watkins, in his classic work on ley lines \"The Old Straight Track\", used the width of a pencil line on a map as the threshold for the tolerance of what might be regarded as an alignment. For example, using a 1Â mm pencil line to draw alignments on a 1:50,000 Ordnance Survey map, the corresponding width on the ground would be 50 m.\n\nContrary to intuition, finding alignments between randomly placed points on a landscape gets progressively easier as the geographic area to be considered increases. One way of understanding this phenomenon is to see that the increase in the number of possible combinations of sets of points in that area overwhelms the decrease in the probability that any given set of points in that area line up.\n\nOne definition which expresses the generally accepted meaning of \"alignment\" is:\n\nMore precisely, a path of width \"w\" may be defined as the set of all points within a distance of \"w/2\" of a straight line on a plane, or a great circle on a sphere, or in general any geodesic on any other kind of manifold. Note that, in general, any given set of points that are aligned in this way will contain a large number of infinitesimally different straight paths. Therefore, only the existence of at least one straight path is necessary to determine whether a set of points is an alignment. For this reason, it is easier to count the sets of points, rather than the paths themselves.\nThe number of alignments found is very sensitive to the allowed width \"w\", increasing approximately proportionately to \"w\", where \"k\" is the number of points in an alignment.\n\nThe following is a very approximate order-of-magnitude estimate of the likelihood of alignments, assuming a plane covered with uniformly distributed \"significant\" points.\n\nConsider a set of \"n\" points in a compact area with approximate diameter \"L\" and area approximately \"L\". Consider a valid line to be one where every point is within distance \"w\"/2 of the line (that is, lies on a track of width \"w\", where \"w\" âª \"L\").\n\nConsider all the unordered sets of \"k\" points from the \"n\" points, of which there are:\n\n(see factorial and binomial coefficient for notation).\n\nTo make a rough estimate of the probability that any given subset of \"k\" points is approximately collinear in the way defined above, let us consider the line between the \"leftmost\" and \"rightmost\" two points in that set (for some arbitrary left/right axis: we can choose top and bottom for the exceptional vertical case). These two points are by definition on this line. For each of the remaining \"k\"-2 points, the probability that the point is \"near enough\" to the line is roughly \"w\"/\"L\", which can be seen by considering the ratio of the area of the line tolerance zone (roughly \"wL\") and the overall area (roughly \"L\").\n\nSo, the expected number of k-point alignments, by this definition, is very roughly:\n\nAmong other things this can be used to show that, contrary to intuition, the number of k-point lines expected from random chance in a plane covered with points at a given density, for a given line width, increases much more than linearly with the size of the area considered, since the combinatorial explosion of growth in the number of possible combinations of points more than makes up for the increase in difficulty of any given combination lining up.\n\nA more precise expression for the number of 3-point alignments of maximum width \"w\" and maximum length \"d\" expected by chance among \"n\" points placed randomly on a square of side \"L\" is \n\nIf edge effects (alignments lost over the boundaries of the square) are included, then the expression becomes\n\nA generalisation to \"k\"-point alignments (ignoring edge effects) is\nwhich has roughly similar asymptotic scaling properties as the crude approximation in the previous section, with combinatorial explosion for large \"n\" overwhelming the effects of other variables.\n\nComputer simulations show that points on a plane tend to form alignments similar to those found by ley hunters in numbers consistent with the order-of-magnitude estimates above, suggesting that ley lines may also be generated by chance. This phenomenon occurs regardless of whether the points are generated pseudo-randomly by computer, or from data sets of mundane features such as pizza restaurants or telephone booths.\n\nIt is easy to find alignments of 4 to 8 points in reasonably small data sets with \"w\" = 50 m.\nChoosing large areas or larger values of \"w\" makes it easy to find alignments of 20 or more points.\n\n"}

Bush encroachment is estimated to affect up to 45 million ha of Namibian land and has severe negative consequences on key Ecosystem services, especially agricultural productivity and groundwater recharge. Agricultural productivity in Namibia has declined by two thirds throughout the past decades, mainly due to the negative impact of bush encroachment. The phenomenon affects both commercial and communal farming in Namibia, mostly the central, eastern and north-eastern regions.\n\nVarious factors have been found to contribute to the process of bush encroachment. These include the reduction in the frequency of fires as well as overgrazing (e.g. caused by overstocking and fencing of farms). Another frequently cited theory is the state-and-transition model. This model outlines how rainfall and its variability is the key driver of vegetation growth and its composition. Further, climate change has been found to accelerate bush encroachment, as C02 in the air fosters bush growth.\n\nAs bush encroachment has been recognised as a major challenge for agricultural productivity as well as a diverse range of ecosystem services, the Namibian government has declared bush control a priority in its fifth National Development Plan (NDP5).\n\nThe term Bush Control refers to actions that are targeted at controlling the density and composition of bushes and shrubs in a given area that is affected by bush encroachment. Three different categories of measures can be distinguished:\n\n\nPractices of combating bush encroachment, regardless of the exact methodology applied, are often referred to as \"de-bushing\". Although this term is widely used and also cited in various scientific works, it is disputed. \"De-bushing\" can easily be misunderstood as the practice of clearing and area of all bush plants, which is not the aim in most efforts to combat bush encroachment. The terms \"bush control, \"bush thinning\" and \"selective bush harvesting\" are therefore considered more adequate terms.\n\nThe Government of Namibia has recognised bush encroachment as a key challenge for the national economy and food safety. In its current National Development Plan 5, it stipulates that a total of 82.200 ha of land shall be treated against bush encroachment annually, i.e. through the thinning of the bush density by means of selective bush harvesting\n\nThe Government of Namibia, through the Support to De-bushing Project, pursues a value addition strategy, promoting the sustainable utilisation of bush biomass, which in turn is expected to finance bush harvesting operations.\n\nBeginning of 2014, a dedicated project to develop strategies and concepts for countering bush encroachment was launched in cooperation between the governments of Namibia and Germany, initially called Support to De-bushing Project. It is implemented jointly by the Namibian Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry (MAWF) and the German development agency Deutsche Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Internationale Zusammenarbeit. Its first implementation phase ended in December 2017 and through bilateral negotiations the project was extended for a second phase, running between 2018 and 2021. The project was re-named to Bush Control and Biomass Utilisation Project to better reflect its strong emphasis on value chain development as trigger for sustainable bush control.\n\nIn early 2016, the De-bushing Advisory Service Namibia was launched. It is a public service institution, mandated with the dissemination of knowledge on the topics of bush encroachment, bush control and biomass utilisation.\nThe De-bushing Advisory Service provides the following services:\n\n\nServices are provided upon inquiry and are public service and therefore not charged.\n\nIncreasingly, the encroacher bush is seen as a resource for an extractive industry. Numerous farmers across the country, but increasingly also corporations from other sectors, harvest the bush with the intention process and sell it to off-takers.\n\nThe following products are currently produced from the encroacher bush biomass:\n\nNamibia has a well-established charcoal sector, which currently comprises approximately 600 producers, which employ a total of 5.000-6.000 workers. Currently, most producers are farmers, who venture into charcoal production as a means to combat bush encroachment on their own land. However, increasingly small enterprises also venture into charcoal making. As per national forestry regulations, charcoal can only be produced from encroaching species. In practice, it however proves difficult to ensure full compliance with these regulations, as the charcoal production is highly decentralised and the inspection capacities of the Directorate of Forestry are low.\n\nIn August 2016 the Namibia Charcoal Association (NCA) was launched. It is a non-profit entity and the official industry representation, currently representing an estimated two-thirds of all charcoal producers in the country.\n\nNamibia Biomass Industry Group is a non-profit association under Section 21 of the Companies Act (Act 28 of 2004) of Namibia. The core objectives as enlisted in the Articles of Association of N-BiG are as follows:\n\nN-BiG was founded in 2016 and functions as the umbrella representative body of the emerging bush based biomass sector in the country.\n\nThe De-bushing Advisory Service Namibia is a public service institution of the Government of Namibia, mandated with the dissemination of knowledge on the topics of bush encroachment, bush control and biomass utilisation. It was initiated in response to the national crisis of accelerating bush encroachment especially on rangeland in vast areas of the country. It was founded in early 2016 and currently is part of the Namibian German bilateral Project on Support to De-bushing, implemented by Deutsche Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Internationale Zusammenarbeit. It was created as part of the 4-year bilateral cooperation project between the Namibian and German governments. It serves as a central knowledge and capacity development platform for the topic of bush control, facilitating sustainable large-scale bush control in Namibia. Its services therewith fall into the areas of rangeland management and natural resource management. Bush encroachment impacts Namibia on a large scale. Up to 45 million hectares of farmland in nine of the countryâs 14\nregions are affected. This equals about one third of Namibia's land area.Bush encroachment has negative impacts on livestock, groundwater recharge, tourism and biodiversity. It lowers the\nproductivity and livestock capacity of pasture land by up to two thirds.\n\n\n"}

Successful communes are awarded the right to display a badge (showing from one to four flowers) on road signs and in other local promotional material. \n\nThe competition was created in 1959 by the French state and it is administered by a distinct national committee since 1972. This committee is still linked to the Ministry of Tourism. All the French communes can take part and there are no application fees. There is not any limitation to the number of awarded communes, so they are not in competition between each other.\n\nThe label has experienced a large success since its creation. The number of villages taking part in the contest has increased from 600 at its inception, to 5,300 in 1972, 10,000 in 1993, and 12,000 in 2005.\n\nThe label comprises four awards: one, two, three or four flowers, according to the efforts of the municipality. Each award is given according to strict criteria. The \"Fleur d'Or\" (\"golden flower\") is a special prize awarded to a small number of applicants. Labelled communes display their flowers on road signs at their entrances.\n\nAs of 2015, there are some 12,000 awarded cities, towns and villages. They represent a third of all the French communes. 226 of them have 4 flowers.\n\nThe \"Concours des villes et villages fleuris\" originates in the various horticultural contests that appeared at the beginning of the 20th century. As tourism was growing, competitions were created for train stations and hotels for them to improve their visual quality. The French Touring Club created the first competition dedicated to villages during the 1920s. Called \"Concours des villages coquets\" (\"cosy villages contest\") it existed until 1939. After the Second World War, the Touring Club created an itinerary of flower-decked roads (\"routes fleuries\") together with the Horticultural Association and the magazine \"Rustica\". The success of the itinerary led to the creation of the present \"Concours des villes et villages fleuris\" in 1959. The competition passed from the French state to a national committee in 1972. Since 1988, its organisation has been the responsibility of the general councils which are the elected assemblies of the departments. The national comity remains the coordinator on a national level.\n\nAt the beginning, the competition was about the aesthetics of green spaces and floral displays. Nowadays, it focuses more on general planning and how it improves the lives of local residents and the experience of visitors.\n\nCommunes that apply for the label are first selected by their department which transmit the application to the regional council. The latter attributes the lowest awards (1, 2 and 3 flowers). The best applications are then submitted to the national committee who can attribute the 4 flowers and extra awards. Boards of examiners are formed on departmental, regional and national levels. Their members are usually municipal councilors, municipal clerks, horticulturists, gardeners, landscape architects, tourist office officials and representatives of various associations.\n\nThe \"Concours des villes et villages fleuris\" awards its labels according to strict criteria. They help examiners to evaluate the motivation of the local authorities, the development they expect through plants and green spaces, how they communicate to the public about it, how they respect the environment, and so forth.\n\nThe evaluation grid comprises a number of questions which can be answered by \"non existent\", \"initiated\", \"realised\" and \"conforted\". The answer to each question determines a level between zero and four flowers. For instance, a question asks if the locality displays flowers and plants all year round; if it is initiated, it can pretend to one or two flowers, if it is realised, to three, and conforted four flowers. The average of all the answers moderated by the general impression of the examiners determine which label the locality is awarded.\n\nThe \"Concours des villes et villages fleuris\" has initiated a European competition called \"Entente Florale Europe\" (\"Europe Floral Harmony\"). It started in 1975 between Great Britain and France and has since expanded to include all members of the European Union and the EFTA. As of 2015, Austria, Belgium, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, the Republic of Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovenia and the United Kingdom are full members of the Entente. During this annual competition, each country submits a candidate locality. The best one is awarded a prize.\n\n\n"}

It has two major peaks: Troglav (\"Threehead\", 1913 m) and the eponymous Dinara (1831 m). The peak called Dinara is the highest peak of Croatia, is shaped like a human head made of stone, and also has a prominence of 728 m.\n\nIts Latin name is \"Adrian oros\" while the current name is suspected to be derived from the name of an ancient Illyrian tribe that lived on the eastern slopes of the mountain.\n\nIt is best known for the fact that its name is the base for the name of a large mountain chain called the Dinaric Alps or \"Dinarides\". The Dinarides are known for being composed of karst â limestone rocks â as is the mountain that named them.\n\nDinara itself spans from the Derala mountain pass (965 m) in the northwest to the Privija pass (1230 m) which is 20Â km to the southeast, where the KameÅ¡nica Mountain begins. The Dinara Mountain is up to 10Â km wide.\n\nDinara is located only a few dozen kilometers away from the Adriatic Sea, and is part of the Dalmatian hinterland, but the climate on Dinara is a much colder, mountain climate, making it one of the coldest places in Croatia with average temperatures between 2 and 4Â Â°C at the peaks. The average precipitation is high, while the number of sunny hours per year ranges between 1,700 and 1,900.\n\nThere are no inhabited areas on the mountain itself and human presence consists mostly of small shacks that belong to the herdsmen from the nearby valleys such as that of the Cetina river.\n\nOne of the most fascinating massifs is on the southwestern slope. It is six kilometers long and up to 1700 meters high, providing an interesting landscape for the travelers on the roads in the valley below to view. The massif does not attract many climbers, but its OÅ¡ljak peak (1706 m) does.\n\nNative vegetation of the Dinara region comprises a large number of plant communities, or habitat types. According to the data available, in the area of the Dinara mountain there are around 750 plant species, of which more than 110 are strictly protected and 55 are endemics.\n\nThe flora consists of mountain grasslands, Scopoli's rockcress (\"Arabidopsis arenosa\", \"Arabidopsis halleri\" and \"Arabidopsis croatica\", dinarian mouse ear \"Hieracium Pilosella\", dalmatian rockbell \"Edraianthus dalmaticus\", pasque flower \"Pulsatilla\", lion's paw \"Leonotis leonurus\", yellow gentian \"Gentiana lutea\", common juniper \"Juniperus communis\" and hairy azalea \"Rhododendron\".\n\nIn terms of ornithology, the Dinara region, particularly the peaks and the slopes of the Dinara mountain appertaining to it and the habitat around the Upper Cetina, from its source to the PeruÄa dam, is designated as a Special Protection Area (SPA) according to the EU Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds.\n\nThe bird species include: common pheasant \"Phasianus colchicus\", common quail \"Coturnix coturnix\", shore lark \"Eremophila alpestris\", redshank \"Tringa totanus\", stone curlew \"Burhinus oedicnemus\", moustached warbler \"Acrocephalus melanopogon\", golden eagle \"Aquila chrysaetos\" and short-toed snake eagle \"Circaetus gallicus\". Also there is sighting of Eurasian griffon vulture \"Gyps fulvus\" probably on their flight over to Cres.\n\nThe mammals of the Dinara region are: brown bear Ursus arctos, grey wolf Canis lupus, Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx, wildcat Felis silvestris, red fox Vulpes vulpes, wild boar Sus scrofa, Eurasian badger Meles meles, brown hare Lepus europaeus and balkan snow vole.\nDinara is host to an endemic species of rodent, the Balkan snow vole (\"Dolomys bogdanovi longipedis\"), known in Croatian as the (\"Dinara mouse\"). It is an endangered species.\n\nThe relatively well-preserved, extensive and diverse habitats of the Dinara and Svilaja mountains and the Upper Cetina provide a refuge to a number of invertebrate species whose natural habitats have been endangered due to specific living conditions they require, while many of them are endemics and placed on the Red List (certain species of caddisflies, dragonflies, stoneflies, orthoptera, etc.).\n\nInvertebrates living in caves and holes make a special group â their biology remains relatively unknown, but they are protected as the cave fauna together with cave vertebrates.\n\nInsects include: dalmatian ringlet Proterebia afra dalmata, rosalia longicorn, longhorn beetle, firebug, hornet, bumblebee, stag beetle and marsh fritillary.\n\nThe herpetofauna of the Dinara region comprises around 15 species of lizards, snakes and amphibians, some of which are endangered, mostly due to the fact that their natural habitats have been either reduced in extent or suffered degradation.\n\nThe herpetofauna comprises: smooth snake, balkan whip snake, nose-horned viper, fire salamander, slow worm, karst meadow viper and alpine newt.\n\n\n"}

Before the Aptian, the island was uplifted, particularly in the east, likely due to the collision of a volcanic island arc. In total, Hispaniola is formed from 11 distinct small island arcs. From the Albian to the Campanian, plutonism, metamorphism and volcanism began simultaneously, taking place underwater on the largely submerged landmass. In the Campanian a second arc collision took place.\nPicrite from the Duarte Complex in central Hispaniola has been inferred as Galapagos hotspot-type island plateau rocks.\n\nThe Cordillera Central in the middle of the island has obducted peridotite from the mid-Cretaceous on top of a mylonite and phyllonite schist shear zone in the Maimon Formation. Deformation appears in rocks north, as far as the volcanic and sedimentary Los Ranchos Formation. They are unconformably overlain by Albian-Cenomanian limestones.\n\nInto the Paleogene at the start of the Cenozoic, volcanism, metamorphism and plutonism continued underwater until the Eocene, still largely below water. However, by the middle Eocene, the amalgamated island arcs collided with the southern margin of the North American Plate at the Florida-Bahama Platform, leading to the formation of extensive carbonates and the end of volcanism and plutonism. The island arc rocks became exposed above the water line and began to erode as an east-west strike-slip fault emerged.\nFrom the Miocene to recent times, oblique strike-slip faults formed along the sutures between old island arcs as the island compressed against North America and oceanic plateau terranes. Nine large fault bounded mountain ranges formed.\n\nWithin the Dominican Republic, the central Cordillera Septentrional spans the strike-slip fault boundary between the North American and Caribbean plates. Faults and folds from the Paleocene to the Pliocene in marine sedimentary rocks indicate its history of uplift, beginning in Eocene pelagic carbonates. Transpression in the Miocene-Pliocene created an anticline in shallow marine carbonates.\n\nThe large Pueblo Viejo oxide gold deposit formed due to gold, quartz and pyrophyllite weathering in a small basin within the Los Ranchos Formation. At its basin, the formation has conglomerate, ascending to sandstone and carbonaceous sandstone with plant fossils indicating proximity to land. Veins filled with metal due to hydrothermal emplacement.\n"}

In 911 A.D., a group of \"pirates\", or Vikings led by Rollo besieged Paris and Chartres. After a victory near Chartres on 26 August, Charles the Simple decided to negotiate with Rollo, resulting in the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte. For the Vikings' loyalty, they were granted all the land between the river Epte and the sea, as well as Brittany, which at the time was an independent country which France had unsuccessfully tried to conquer. Rollo also agreed to be baptised and to marry Charles' daughter, Gisela. The land would become known as \"Normandy\", the land of the North Men and included \"Les Ãles d'la Manche\" or the Channel Islands. Religion was strengthened with the arrival and conversion of the Normans to Christianity, in the 10th Century.\n\nThere were many churches built by the Normans in the 11th and 12th centuries, many on top of previous chapels which were themselves alongside pagan places of worship, the islands being divided up into parishes in the 11th Century and land areas granted by endowment to French-based religious centres, Mont Saint Michel Abbey received four and Marmoutier Abbey, Tours six from Guernsey, Cerisy-la-ForÃªt acquired two in Jersey, but most other Jersey parishes were scattered amongst other people and institutions.\n\nThe Islands embraced the French Calvinist form of Protestantism during the Reformation Roman Catholicism continued until orders were received to remove all signs of Catholicism in 1547. A brief return to Catholicism saw the three women turned into martyrs before another turn, back to the Protestant faith and a fear of France and Catholics. Methodism took a stronghold at the end of the 18th Century.\n\nThe Little Chapel in Guernsey has been said that it \"is the smallest functioning chapel in Europe, if not the world\", and it is \"believed to be the worldâs smallest consecrated church.\"\n\nAt least three churches in Guernsey have pre history carved stones, the most famous being La Gran'mÃ¨re du ChimquiÃ¨re. In Jersey, at La Hougue Bie a 12th Century chapel was built on a Neolithic ritual site which was in use around 3500Â BC. In Western Europe, it is one of the largest and best preserved passage graves. Several churches, including Castel Church, Guernsey, have been built using materials dating back to the Roman Empire. St Saviour Church in Guernsey has a number of tunnels running underneath, built by the Organisation Todt for Nazi Germany in the 1940s.\n\nThe historic toleration of religious minorities has led to many persecuted minorities seeking refuge in the Islands, such as Huguenots from 1548. The influx of the Protestant refugees led to Calvinism becoming the main religion, forcing a break from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Coutances in 1568 to the Bishop of Winchester. Religion became strictly enforced with physical punishments (whippings, stocks, imprisonment) and torture to get confessions for Channel Islands Witch Trials for 100 years, ending only with the Act of Uniformity 1662 of Charles II of England. In the English Civil War Guernsey, with stronger puritanical sympathies supported Parliament whereas Jersey was happy to restore episcopalian constitutions, siding with the Royalists. \n\nA famous refugee Guernsey in 1855 was Victor Hugo who increasingly expressed anti-Catholic and anti-clerical views. Hugo counted 740 attacks on a book he wrote whilst in Guernsey, \"Les MisÃ©rables\" in the Catholic press. The last major act of non-toleration goes back to 1556, with the Guernsey Martyrs who died for their Protestant faith. The Island's toleration has left a rich legacy of churches, chapels and places of worship.\n\nThe maintenance of Parish churches was, before the Reformation, the responsibility of the Catholic church. To avoid the English Crown taking over responsibility as successor, Charles II in 1677 instructed the Guernsey churchwardens to raise monies from the parishioners.\n\nIn 1893 a religious census was undertaken in Guernsey showing around 50% of the population attended:\n\n2010 breakdown of followers in the Channel Islands: \n\n\n\n\n\"This list is incomplete.

These lists are used for peak bagging, whereby hillwalkers attempt to reach all the summits on a list, the oldest and best-known, being the 282 in Scotland, which amongst other criteria, must be above .\n\nA height above 2,000 ft, or more latterly 600 m, is considered necessary to be a \"mountain\" in the British Isles, and apart from the Munros (who favour isolation), all lists require a prominence of at least . A prominence of between (e.g. some and ), does not meet the UIAA definition of an \"independent\" peak. Most lists consider a prominence between as a \"top\", and not a mountain (e.g. many and ). A popular designation are the , with a prominence above . Prominences above , are the , the international classification of a \"major\" mountain.\n\nThere is no worldwide consensus on the definition of \"mountain\", but in Great Britain and Ireland it is often taken to be any summit at least 2,000 feet (or 610 metres) high (also called elevation). The UK government defines \"mountain\" as land over for the purposes of freedom of access. When Calf Top in Cumbria, was re-surveyed 2016 and confirmed to be almost exactly 2,000 ft, 6 millimetres above the 609.6 m threshold for a 2,000 ft peak, the Ordnance Survey described Calf Top as England's \"last mountain\".\n\n\nIn addition, all British Isles definitions, with the exception of definitions that rely on , include a minimum topographical prominence requirement (also called relative height, or drop, or re-ascent, between neighbouring peaks), which is typically . The lowest minimum prominence is , the Nuttalls and Vandeleur-Lynams, however most definitions do not consider prominences below . Many definitions use the term Tops to refer to the sub-class of peaks that do not meet a prominence threshold for the main definition, but have a prominence of between . Some definitions ignore height completely and just focus purely on prominence (e.g. P600s, Marilyns, and HuMPs).\n\nProminence requirements are even strongly debated regarding UIAA classification of major Himalayan mountains. In 1994, regarding classification of summits, the UIAA stated that for a \"peak\" to be independent (e.g. not a sub-peak of a mountain), it needed a prominence over 30 m, and in addition, a \"mountain\" had to have a prominence over 300 m.\n\nUnlike the single measurement of elevation, prominence requires the detailed measurement of all contours around the peak, and is therefore subject to change and revision over time, and thus tables based on prominence are subject to revision. Some definitions use an imperial measurement for height, but a metric measurement for the topological prominence (e.g. Murdos, Hewitts and Nuttals).\n\n\nNo definition of a British Isles mountain or hill uses an explicit \"quantitative\" metric of topographic isolation (e.g. distance to the next point of equal height), however, the concept of isolation is embedded in the \"qualitative\" definition of a Scottish Munro, from the Scottish Mountaineering Club requirement of \"sufficient separation\" (instead of prominence).\n\nMountains in Scotland are frequently referred to as \"hills\" no matter what their height, as reflected in names such as the \"Cuillin Hills\" and the \"Torridon Hills\".\n\nThe \"Database of British and Irish Hills\" (\"DoBIH\") was created in 2001 \"with the intention of providing a comprehensive, up-to-date resource for British hillwalkers\". It is now maintained by a team of eight editors, and is described by the Long Distance Walkers Association as \"now the most reliable online source for all Registers\" (i.e. all lists of summits attained). The DoBIH has been used as the source by several important books on mountain classification in the British Isles, including Mark Jackson's 2010 book on HuMPS and TuMPS, titled \"More Relative Hills of Britain\".\n\nDoBIH is available as a downloadable database or in an online version under the title \"Hill Bagging\". the database included 20,859 hills, including all Marilyns, HuMPs, TuMPs, Simms, Dodds, Munros and Tops, Corbetts and Tops, Grahams and Tops, Donalds and Tops, Furths, Hewitts, Nuttalls, Buxton & Lewis, Bridges, Murdos, Deweys, Donald Deweys, Highland Fives, Wainwrights, Birketts, Synges, Fellrangers, County tops, SIBs (Significant Islands of Britain), Dillons, Arderins, Vandeleur-Lynams, Myrddyn Deweys, Carns and Binnions, \"with subs and deletions\".\n\nSince 2012, the DoBIH has a data-sharing agreement with the Irish online database of mountains and hills, called \"MountainViews\", and they hold each other's data.\n\nThe P600s are mountains in the British Isles that have a topographical prominence of at least , regardless of absolute height or other merits. The list was also developed by Alan Dawson in 2004 (creator of the Marilyn list), and refined in 2004 and 2006. Dawson initially used a 2,000 ft metric (or 610 m, the P610s), and called his list the \"Majors\", as it is one of the shortest of the noted lists of mountains in the British Islands, and one of the most testing requirements. The term \"Major\" is often used by others when listing the P600 peaks. In 2006, 93 P600s were identified in Great Britain: 82 in Scotland, 4 in England and 7 in Wales; together with 1 in Northern Ireland, 1 on the Isle of Man, and 24 P600s in the Republic of Ireland, which brought the total number of P600 mountains in the British Isles to 119. However, since 2006, Welsh peak Moel Siabod's prominence was recalculated to 600 metres, and the list of P600s was expanded to 120.\n\nThe British Isle P600s, contain 54 of the 282 Scottish Munros, and 10 of the 34 Non-Scottish Munros, which are also called ; these 64 British Isles mountains meet the designation of being above in height, and in prominence (e.g. \"Super-Majors\").\n\n\nP600 is an important international mountain classification criterion, along with Ultras or P1500, prominence above . The Database of British and Irish Hills also recognises the P500 mountain classification, prominence above .\n\nThe Marilyns are mountains and hills in the British Isles that have a topographical prominence of at least , regardless of absolute height or other merits. As at October 2018, there were 1,552 Marilyns in Great Britain: 1,219 in Scotland, 175 in England, and 158 in Wales (Black Mountain, on the England-Wales border, is counted as being in Wales). There are 454 Marilyns in Ireland (389 in the Republic of Ireland and 66 in Northern Ireland), and 5 on the Isle of Man, bringing the total for the British Isles to 2,011. The list was first compiled in 1992 by Alan Dawson. The name was coined as an ironic contrast to the designation \"Munro\", which is homophonous with \"(Marilyn) Monroe\". The Marilyns are one of the most popular lists for peak baggers.\n\n\nThe Marilyns were expanded in 2007 by the HuMPs (Hundred and upwards Metre Prominence) which reduces the prominence requirement to . Therefore, all British Isles Marilyns are British Isles HuMPS (but not vice versa). The list was compiled by Mark Jackson from a number of sources and published online in 2010 in \"More Relative Hills of Britain\". There are 2,986 HuMPs in the British Isles: 2,168 in Scotland, 833 in Ireland, 444 in England, 366 in Wales and 11 in the Channel Islands.\n\nA Simm is a mountain the British Isles that is over high and has a prominence of at least . The word comes from Six-hundred Metre Mountain. There are currently 2,754 recorded Simms in the British Isles, including 2,188 Scottish Simms, 192 English Simms, 149 Welsh Simms, 1 Isle of Man Simm, and 224 Irish Simms. By definition, all Simms are also TuMPs (see below) and most, if not all, are mountains, depending on whether 600 metres or 2,000 feet (610 m) (e.g. a ), is used as the criterion. The idea of the Simm was introduced by Alan Dawson in June 2010, who noted that a Simm was the \"broadest credible definition of what could be objectively conceived as a mountain in Britain\". , 6,414 people had registered themselves as having climbed all 282 Scottish Munros, over 270 people had registeted climbing all 1,552 Marilyns of Great Britain, while only 2 people had registered completion of the 2,529 Simms of Great Britain, and no one had yet declared completion of all 2,754 Simms of the British Isles.\n\n\nIn 2010, Mark Jackson further expanded the HuMPS and compiled the TuMPs (Thirty and uwpards Metre Prominence), a list of all hills in Britain having a prominence above . By definition, all Murdos, Corbett Tops, Graham Tops, Hewitts and Deweys are also TuMPs. There are 17,044 TuMPs; approximately half of that number that did not appear in previously researched lists were researched by Mark Jackson between 2006 and 2009. Since 2012 the list has been published and maintained by the editors of The Database of British and Irish Hills.\n\nThe Munros are mountains in Scotland over . The list was originally compiled by Sir Hugh Munro in 1891, and is modified from time to time by the Scottish Mountaineering Club (SMC). Unlike most other lists, the Munros do not depend on a rigid prominence criterion for entry; instead, those that satisfy the subjective measure of being a \"separate mountain\" are regarded as \"Munros\", while subsidiary summits are given the status of Munro Tops. There are 282 Munros, and 227 further Munro Tops, totalling 509 summits, all of them in the Scottish Highlands.\n\nReal Munro is used to describe Munros with a prominence over (the Marilyn prominence threshold), and there are 202 Real Munros in Scotland. Of the 282 Scottish Munros, 54 meet the in prominence to be P600s.\n\n\nThe Murdos apply objective criteria to the Munros and their associated tops. They comprise all the summits in Scotland over with a prominence of at least . There are currently 442 Murdos, compared to 282 Munros, or 509 Munros plus Munro Tops. Alan Dawson first compiled the list in 1995.\n\nAll Murdos are also Munro Tops, but many Munro Tops fail to qualify as Murdos because of insufficient relative height. Before 1997 there were seven Murdos that were \"not\" Munro Tops, some with quite substantial relative heights. All seven were included in the 1997 edition of Munro's Tables, plus two non-Murdos: Little Pap on Lochnagar and Knight's Peak on Sgurr nan Gillean (deleted in September 2013 after surveying showed it to be below 3000 feet. Little Pap has an estimated drop of only 22 metres and the reason for its re-introduction to the list, following its removal in the 1981 edition of Munro's Tables, is unclear.\n\nThe Corbetts are peaks in Scotland that are between high with a prominence of at least . The list was compiled in the 1920s by John Rooke Corbett, a Bristol-based climber and SMC member, and was published posthumously after his sister passed it to the SMC. there are 222 Corbetts, many of them in areas of Scotland with no Munros, include Moidart, Ardgour, the Southern Uplands and the islands of Arran, Jura, RÃ¹m and Harris.\n\nA list of Corbett Tops, covering every mountain in Scotland with between of height and between \n\nThe Grahams are mountains in Scotland between high, with a drop of at least all round. The list of mountains fitting these criteria was first published in 1992 by Alan Dawson in \"The Relative Hills of Britain\" as the Elsies (LCs, short for Lesser Corbetts). They were later named Grahams after the late Fiona Torbet (nÃ©e Graham) who had compiled a similar list around the same time. Dawson continues to maintain the list, which contained 219 hills distributed as follows: Highlands south of the Great Glen 87, Highlands north of the Great Glen 84, Central and Southern Scotland 23, Skye 10, Mull 7, Harris 3, Jura 2, Arran 1, Rum 1, South Uist 1. The number of Grahams was reduced from 224, following surveys in 2014 that showed Corwharn, Ben Aslak and Ladylea Hill to be below high.\n\n\nDawson in 2004 published a list of Graham Tops covering every mountain in Scotland with between of height and between \n\nThe Donalds are mountains in the Scottish Lowlands over , amongst other criteria. The list was compiled by Percy Donald in 1935 and is maintained by the SMC. Whether a high point is a Donald is determined by a complicated formula which also contains qualitative elements around \"sufficient topographical interest\". The formula necessitates the splitting of Donalds into Donald Hills and Donald Tops. In general, all Donald Hills have a prominence over , but the prominence of Donald Tops can range from . Donalds can be Corbetts or Grahams and the SMC state that: \"Percy Donald's original Tables are seen as a complete entity, unlike the Munros, Corbetts and Grahams.\" There are 140 Donalds, comprising 89 Donald Hills and 51 Donald Tops.\n\n\nGiven the complexity of the Donald classification, the simpler New Donalds were introduced by Alan Dawson in his 1995 book, \"The Grahams and the New Donalds\", with an explicit prominence threshold of ; there are 118 New Donalds, and while all Donald Hills are New Donalds, 22 Donald Tops are not.\n\n\nFurths are mountains in Great Britain and Ireland furth of (i.e. \"outside\") Scotland that would otherwise qualify as Munros or Munro Tops. They are sometimes referred to as the Irish, English or Welsh Munros. There are 34 furths; 15 in Wales, 13 in Ireland and 6 in England. The highest is Snowdon. Of these 34 SMC identified Furths, 33 have a prominence above (e.g. the Murdo Furths), 14 have a prominence above (e.g. the Real Munro Furths), and 10 have a prominence above (e.g. the P600 Furths).\n\nThe Scottish Mountaineering Club (\"SMC\") maintains the list of Furths and records claims of Munroists who go on to complete the Furths (called \"Furthists\").\n\n\nThe Hewitts are Hills in England, Wales and Ireland over two thousand feet (609.6Â m), with a relative height of at least . The English and Welsh lists were compiled and are maintained by Alan Dawson. Dawson originally called them \"Sweats\" in his book, being Summits - Wales and England Above Two thousand; the Irish list is by Clem Clements. The list addresses one of the criticisms of the Nuttalls by requiring hills to have a relative height of , thus excluding the 125 least prominent Nuttalls from the list.\n\n, the DoBIH listed 524 Hewitts, 209 in Ireland, 180 in England and 135 in Wales. Since their publication in 1997, Birks Fell in England and Mynydd Graig Goch have been added and Black Mountain deemed to be in Wales only. There is no Scottish equivalent of a Hewitt (e.g. Murdos meet the criteria for mountains over 3,000 ft, but Corbetts and Grahams have higher prominence thresholds). Hewitts are a sub-class of the newer 2010 British Isles classification, the , or \"metric Hewitt\", with a height threshold, and a prominence threshold. Simms have replaced Hewitts, however, Dawson still maintains a list of Hewitts.\n\n\nThe Nuttalls are mountains in England and Wales only (e.g. not Ireland) over with a relative height of at least . There were 444 Nuttalls in the original list (254 in England and 190 in Wales), compiled by John and Anne Nuttall and published in 1989-90 in two volumes, \"The Mountains of England & Wales\". After updates the total reached 446 in August 2018 with the inclusion of Miller Moss.\n\nBy including high points that rise by as little as above their surroundings, the list of Nuttalls is sometimes criticised for including too many insignificant minor tops. The Hewitts (see above) are one attempt to avoid this. Some Nuttalls would therefore not be considered peaks or mountains under UIAA definitions.\n\nWith the exception of Pillar Rock, a rocky outcrop on Pillar in the Lake District, the peaks of all of the Nuttalls can be reached without resort to rock climbing. , 302 people are known to have completed the list, though this includes some who did not climb Pillar Rock, which the authors permit. They have also announced that Tinside Rigg and Long Fell (added to the list in 2016) need not be climbed as they are in a restricted area of Warcop Artillery Range.\n\n\nThe Wainwrights are mountains or hills (locally known as \"fells\") in the English Lake District National Park that have a chapter in one of Alfred Wainwright's \"Pictorial Guides to the Lakeland Fells\". There are 214 Wainwrights in the seven guides. There are no qualifications for inclusion other than Wainwright's choice. The lowest is Castle Crag in Borrowdale, at . A further 116 summits were included in the supplementary guide, \"The Outlying Fells of Lakeland\", and are known as the Wainwright Outlying Fells.\n\n\nThe Birketts are all the fell tops over within the boundaries of the Lake District National Park. Height and location, but not prominence, are the criteria. The list was devised by Bill Birkett as the basis for his 1994 book \"Complete Lakeland Fells\". There are 541 of these tops, and they include 209 of the 214 Wainwrights, and 59 of the 116 Wainwright Outlying Fells. The 5 Wainwrights that are not Birketts are: Armboth Fell, Baystones, Castle Crag (which, at , is Wainwright's only sub-1,000Â ft summit), Graystones and Mungrisdale Common. Birketts are listed in the .\n\n\nThe Vandeleur-Lynam is the Irish equivalent of a Nuttall, except that the definition is fully metric, with a height requirement of , and prominence requirement of . As with the Nuttalls, Vandeleur-Lynams do not meet the UIAA requirements for a \"peak\" or \"mountain\". In 1952, Irish climber Joss Lynam produced a list of 2,000 ft Irish summits with 50 ft drop with assistance from Rev CRP Vandeleur. Lynam updated a version of this list and published it in a reprint of \"Mountaineering in Ireland\" by Claude Wall, printed in 1976. The metricised equivalent was first published in 1997. There are 273 Vandeleur-Lynams in Ireland.\n\n\nThe Arderins are mountains in Ireland above , with a prominence over . The list was drawn up in 2002 by the Irish \"MountainViews\" publisher Simon Stewart from an early listing of the Myrddyn Deweys with hills from the Vandeleur-Lynams which meet the higher prominence criterion. The name, Arderins, was used in 2009, comes from the 527 m hill, Arderin, which is the County Top for County Laois and County Offaly in Ireland, and translates as \"Height of Ireland\". The Arderins were published in the 2013 book, \"A Guide to Ireland's Mountain Summits: The Vandeleur-Lynams & the Arderins\". According to the MountainViews Online Database, Ireland has 407 Arderins, of which 207 are over 2,000 ft and classed as Hewitts, and the 222 are over 600 m and classed as Simms.\n\n\nIn addition, Mountainviews uses the term Arderin Begs for the additional class of peaks over in height, and with a prominence between . In 2018, Ireland had 124 Arderin Begs.\n\nIn 2013, Simon Stewart, publisher of Irish mountain database \"MountainViews Online Database\", published: \"A Guide to Ireland's Mountain Summits: The Vandeleur-Lynams & the Arderins\". In the book, Stewart proposed a new classification of an Irish mountain, being one with a height above , and a prominence over . Stewart identified 222 Irish peaks as meeting his new classification. MountainViews used this definition to create the list of \"100 Highest Mountains in Ireland\", which has also become popular to use in Ireland.\n\n\nMountainViews and Database of British and Irish Hills recognise a list of 337 summits as Carns, having height above and below .\n\nMountainViews and Database of British and Irish Hills recognise a list of 484 summits as Binnions, having prominence at least and height below . Binnion Hill is a summit of 250m in County Donegal, site of the Battle of Binnion Hill and possibly the source of the name.\n\nClimbing in the highest point of each county is a popular form of peak bagging, dating back to the 1920s when John Rooke Corbett was attempting to visit all British County Tops.\n\n\nThe Deweys and related categories extend the Hewitts of England, Wales and Ireland to 500 metres, and include summits in Scotland, where there are no Hewitts.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dodds is a list of hills in the England, Wales, and Scotland between in height, with a prominence above . The criteria for Dodds are designed to include Simms below 600 metres, but above 500 metres. In 2015, the \"Relative Hill of Britain\" site identified 1,339 Dodds. The name comes from DOnald Deweys, Deweys and Scotland.\n\nA Hardy is the highest point of a UK hill range, a UK island over or 4.05Â kmÂ²) or a UK top-tier administrative area (counties and unitary authorities). There are now 347 Hardys with the recent addition (up to July 2016) of 5 low lying English coastal estuary islands: 61 hill ranges, 96 islands and 190 administrative areas. 183 are in England, 31 in Wales, 107 in Scotland and 26 in Northern Ireland. The list was first compiled in the 1990s by Ian Hardy.\n\nThe Database of British and Irish Hills recognises as Bridges the 407 summits in George Bridge's \"Mountains of England and Wales: Tables of the 2000ft Summits\" (1973, West Col Productions), and a list is available on the HillBagging site. While all Bridges are over 2,000 ft, there is no prominence threshold, however the list is similar to the 446 Nuttals.\n\nThe Database of British and Irish Hills recognises as Buxton & Lewis the 422 summits in the book by Chris Buxton and Gwyn Lewis, \"Mountain Summits of England and Wales\" (1986, , Red Dial Publications), and a list is available on the HillBagging site. While all Buxton & Lewis summits are over 2,000 ft, there is no prominence threshold, however the list is similar to the 446 Nuttals.\n\nThe Database of British and Irish Hills recognises as Fellrangers the 227 Lake District summits in Mark Richard's \"Fellranger\" series of eight guidebooks (originally published Harper Collins startring with \"Central Fells\" ; reprinted by Cicerone; 2013 boxed set ), and a list is available on the HillBagging site. There is no height or prominence threshold.\n\nThe Database of British and Irish Hills recognises as Synges the 647 Lake District summits in Timothy Synge's \"The Lakeland Summits: Survey of the Fells of the Lake District National Park\" (1995, Sigma: ), and a list is available on the HillBagging site. There is no height or prominence threshold.\n\nThe following are lists of hills for a given region in the British Isles:\n\nEngland:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "65039", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65039", "title": "Muskeg", "text": "Muskeg\n\nMuskeg (; , lit. \"moss bog\") is an acidic soil type common in Arctic and boreal areas, although it is found in other northern climates as well. Muskeg is approximately synonymous with bogland, but \"muskeg\" is the standard term in Western Canada and Alaska, while 'bog' is common elsewhere. The term became common in these areas because it is of Cree origin; \"maskek\" (áªá¢á«á ) meaning low-lying marsh. Large tracts of this soil existing in Siberia may be called muskeg or bogland interchangeably. \n\nMuskeg consists of dead plants in various states of decomposition (as peat), ranging from fairly intact sphagnum moss, to sedge peat, to highly decomposed humus. Pieces of wood can make up five to fifteen percent of the peat soil. Muskeg tends to have a water table near the surface. The sphagnum moss forming it can hold fifteen to thirty times its own weight in water, allowing the spongy wet muskeg to form on sloping ground. Muskeg patches are ideal habitats for beavers, pitcher plants, agaric mushrooms and a variety of other organisms.\n\nMuskeg forms because permafrost, clay or bedrock prevents water drainage. The water from rain and snow collects, forming permanently waterlogged vegetation and stagnant pools. Muskeg is wet, acidic, and relatively infertile, which prevents large trees from growing, although stunted shore pine, cottonwood, some species of willow, and black spruce are typically found in these habitats. It needs two conditions to develop: abundant rain and cool summers. A dead plant that falls on dry soil is normally attacked by bacteria and fungi and quickly rots. If the same plant lands in water or on saturated soil, it decomposes differently. Less oxygen is available under water, so aerobic bacteria and fungi fail to colonize the submerged debris effectively. In addition, cool temperatures retard bacterial and fungal growth. This causes slow decomposition, and thus the plant debris gradually accumulates to form peat and eventually muskeg. Depending on the underlying topography of the land, muskeg can reach depths greater than 30 metres (100Â ft).\n\nAlthough at first glance muskeg resembles a plain covered with short grasses, a closer look reveals a bizarre and almost unearthly landscape. Small stands of stunted and often dead trees, which vaguely resemble Bonsai trees, grow where land protrudes above the water table, with small pools of water stained dark red scattered about. Its grassland appearance invites the unwary to walk on it, but even the most solid muskeg is spongy and waterlogged. Traveling through muskeg is a strange and dangerous experience for the unaccustomed. Muskeg can grow atop bodies of water, especially small ponds and streams. Because of the water beneath, the muskeg surface sometimes ripples underfoot. Thinner patches allow large animals to fall through, becoming trapped under the muskeg and drowning. Moose are at a special disadvantage in muskeg due to their long legs, minimal hoof area, and great weight. Hunters and hikers may occasionally encounter young moose in muskeg-covered ponds submerged up to their torsos or necks, having been unaware of the unstable ground.\n\nMuskeg can be a significant impediment to transportation. During the 1870s, muskeg in Northern Ontario was reported to have swallowed a railroad engine whole when a track was laid on muskeg instead of clearing down to bedrock.\n\nMany other instances have been reported of heavy construction equipment vanishing into muskeg in the spring as the frozen muskeg beneath the vehicle thawed. Construction in muskeg-laden areas sometimes requires the complete removal of the soil and filling with gravel. If the muskeg is not completely cleared to bedrock, its high water content will cause buckling and distortion from winter freezing, much like permafrost.\n\nOne method of working atop muskeg is to place large logs on the ground, covered with a thick layer of clay or other stable material. This is commonly called a corduroy road. To increase the effectiveness of the corduroy, prevent erosion, and allow removal of material with less disturbance to the muskeg, a geotextile fabric is sometimes placed down before the logs. However temporary winter access roads on muskeg (ice road), created by clearing the insulating snow and allowing the muskeg to freeze, are more commonly used as they are cheaper to construct and easier to decommission. Water is often sprayed on these roads to thicken the ice allowing heavy trucks and equipment to safely access remote sites in the winter .\nIn Jack London's short story, \"Love of Life,\" the starving protagonist eats muskeg berries along the trail. \"A muskeg berry is a bit of seed enclosed in a bit of water. In the mouth the water melts away and the seed chews sharp and bitter. The man knew there was no nourishment in the berries, but he chewed them patiently with a hope greater than knowledge and defying experience.\"\nAnd in Hadley Mentzer's inspiration speech \"Freedom of spech, freedom of muskegs,\" she made to say \"Muskegs are not bad. Drinking the soup from their waters is one of the heathiest things that this town does.\"\nAlso, in Rick Riordan's young adult novel \"The son of Neptune\", one of the protagonists accidentally gets swallowed by muskeg soil as a trap laid by the Earth goddess Gaia.\n\n"}

Until 2011 it grew to an area of . As the island expanded, it formed a canal in front of ViÅ¡njica. Canal is named \"Karlica\" and is today considered the better access path to Ada Huja's bay of Rukavac where the ViÅ¡njica Marina is located. The island was originally round but by 2017 it got elongated and grew into the almost perfectly symmetrical eye shape. \n\nName of the island, Paradajz, means tomato in Serbian language.

{"id": "37154099", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37154099", "title": "River terraces (tectonicâclimatic interaction)", "text": "River terraces (tectonicâclimatic interaction)\n\nTerraces can be formed in many ways and in several geologic and environmental settings. By studying the size, shape, and age of terraces, one can determine the geologic processes that formed them. When terraces have the same age and/or shape over a region, it is often indicative that a large-scale geologic or environmental mechanism is responsible. Tectonic uplift and climate change are viewed as dominant mechanisms that can shape the earthâs surface through erosion. River terraces can be influenced by one or both of these forcing mechanisms and therefore can be used to study variation in tectonics, climate, and erosion, and how these processes interact.\n\nLong-lived river (fluvial) systems can produce a series of terrace surfaces over the course of their geologic lifetime. When rivers flood, sediment deposits in sheets across the floodplain and build up over time. Later, during a time of river erosion, this sediment is cut into, or incised, by the river and flushed downstream. The previous floodplain is therefore abandoned and becomes a river terrace. A river terrace is composed of an abandoned surface, or tread, and the incised surface, or riser. If you can date the age of the terrace tread, one can get an estimate of the age of abandonment of that surface, and the age of incision. A simple calculation of h/t can give the average rate of incision(r), where h = height of river terrace from river and t = age of surface. It is important to note that these rates of incision assume a constant rate of incision over the entire height and time.\n\nThe ages of incision and flooding (aggradation) can have different interpretations for each fluvial system, where each region may respond independently to external variation. Many variables control the behavior of the river and whether it erodes or floods. Changes in the steepness of the stream gradient, the amount of sediment contained in the river, and the total amount of water flowing through the system, all influence how a river behaves. There is a delicate equilibrium that controls a river system, which, when disturbed, causes flooding and incising events to occur and produce terracing.\n\nDating of these abandoned terrace surfaces (treads) is possible using a variety of geochronologic techniques. The type of technique used, however, is dependent on the composition and age of the terraces. Currently used techniques are magnetostratigraphy, low temperature thermochronology, cosmogenic nuclides, radiocarbon, thermoluminescence, optically stimulated luminescence, and U-Th disequilibria. Additionally, if there is a succession of preserved fossils, biostratigraphy can be used.\n\nScale of observation is always a factor when evaluating tectonic and climatic forcing. At a glimpse in geologic time, one of these forcing mechanisms may look to be the dominant process. Observations made on long geologic times scales (â¥10annum) typically reveal much about slower, larger-magnitude geologic processes such as tectonism from a regional to even global scale. Evaluation on geologically short time scales (10-10 a) can reveal much about the relatively shorter climatic cycles, local to regional erosion, and how they could drive terrace development. Regional periods of terrace formation likely mark a time of when stream erosion was much greater than sediment accumulation. River erosion can be driven by tectonic uplift, climate, or potentially both mechanisms. It is difficult in many areas, however, to decisively pinpoint whether tectonism or climate change can individually drive tectonic uplift, enhanced erosion, and therefore terrace formation. In many cases, simplifying the geologic issue to tectonic-driven vs. climate-driven is a mistake because tectonic-climate interactions occur together in a positive feedback cycle.\n\nRivers in continental interiors that have not experienced tectonic activity in the geological recent history likely record climatic changes through terracing. Terraces record natural, periodic variations driven by cycles such as the Milankovitch cycle. These cycles can describe how the Earth's orbit and rotational wobble vary over time. The Milankovitch cycles, along with solar forcing, have been determined to drive periodic environmental change on a global scale, namely between glacial and interglacial environments. Each river system will respond to these climate variations on a regional scale. In addition, the regional environment will determine how change in sediment and precipitation will drive river incision and aggradation. Terraces along the river will record the cyclic changes, where glacial and interglacial time periods are associated with either incision or aggradation.\n\nIn contrast, coastal marine terraces can be preserved only by tectonism or a progressive lowering of sea level. The seismically active coastline of southern California, USA, for example, can be considered an emergent coastline, where tectonism due to transpression provides uplift of shorelines formed during periods of relatively high sea level. Subsequent wave erosion along uplifted portions of the coastline produces an inset wave cut platform and terrace riser below the abandoned marine terrace surface that formed initially at sea level. Uplift can therefore lead to a sequence of marine terraces at a few distinct elevations along the coast. Although these surfaces formed at sea level maxima during interglacial periods, the landforms are preserved solely due to tectonic uplift.\n\nTectonic uplift and climatic factors interact as a positive feedback system, where each forcing mechanism drives the other. One of the greatest examples of this feedback between tectonic and climatic interactions may be preserved in the Himalayan front and in the development of the rain shadow effect and the Asian Monsoon.\n\nThe Himalayas act as an orographic barrier that can impede atmospheric circulation and moving air masses. When these air masses try to move up and over the Himalaya, they are forced up against the barrier. The mass condenses as it rises, releasing moisture, which results in precipitation on that flank of the mountains. As the air mass moves over the mountain, it gradually becomes drier until it descends on the other side of the barrier with little moisture left. This effect is known the \"rain shadow effect. In the Himalaya, this barrier effect is so great that it was an important environmental factor in developing the Asian Monsoon.\n\nTectonic uplift during the creation of high mountainous regions can produce incredible surface elevations and therefore exposure of rocks to wind and water. High precipitation can drive enhanced erosion of the exposed rocks and lead to rapid denudation of sediment from the mountains. Buoyancy of the crust, or isostasy, will then drive further tectonic uplift, in order to achieve equilibrium, as sediment is continuously stripped from the top. Enhanced uplift will then create higher topography, drive increased precipitation which will concentrate erosion, and further uplift.\n\n"}

Two expeditions were led by Vitus Bering, with the findings proving the separation of two continents through the Bering Sea. Being the first European nation to chart much of what comprises the modern American state of Alaska, many locations retain Russian place names. The discovery of sizable fur bearing populations by Bering drew the attention of promyshlenniki previously engaged in the Siberian fur trade. Based out of the Siberian ports of Okhotsk or Petropavlovsk, fur trappers sailed and reported the location of land formations like the Aleutian Islands, Kodiak Island and portions of the Alaskan mainland. Relations with Native Alaskans was often terse due to the uncontrolled actions of particular promyshlenniki who killed and raped Indigenous on islands they trapped furs.\n\nBy the mid century the creation of companies was required to shoulder the increasing operational costs. Grigory Shelikhov was prominent amongst these rising merchants, creating Russian settlements on Kodiak Island and later perpetrating the deaths of many Alutiiqs in the Awa'uq Massacre. With the Ukase of 1799 the Russian Empire gave the United American Company (the successor to Shelikhov's organization) a monopoly among Russian fur companies over North America to the 55Â° N latitude. The newly formed Russian-American Company (RAC) was expected to additionally create new colonies to strengthen the Russian claims to the region. The RAC funded in part or wholly expeditions of the Imperial Russian Navy like the First Russian circumnavigation. The Russo-American Treaty of 1824 and the Russo-British Treaty of 1825 formalised the claims of Russian America, essentially the borders of Alaska.\n"}

The Saint Lawrence River flows in a roughly north-easterly direction, connecting the Great Lakes with the Atlantic Ocean and forming the primary drainage outflow of the Great Lakes Basin. It traverses the Canadian provinces of Quebec and Ontario, and is part of the international boundary between Ontario, Canada, and the U.S. state of New York. This river also provides the basis of the commercial Saint Lawrence Seaway.\n\nThe Saint Lawrence River begins at the outflow of Lake Ontario and flows adjacent to Gananoque, Brockville, Morristown, Ogdensburg, Massena, Cornwall, Montreal, Trois-RiviÃ¨res, and Quebec City before draining into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, the largest estuary in the world. The estuary begins at the eastern tip of Ãle d'OrlÃ©ans, just downstream from Quebec City. The river becomes tidal around Quebec City.\n\nThe Saint Lawrence River runs from the farthest headwater to the mouth and from the outflow of Lake Ontario. These numbers include the estuary; without the estuary the length from Lake Ontario is ca. 500 km (ca. 300 mi). The farthest headwater is the North River in the Mesabi Range at Hibbing, Minnesota. Its drainage area, which includes the Great Lakes, the world's largest system of freshwater lakes, is , of which is in Canada and is in the United States. The basin covers parts of Ontario and Quebec in Canada, parts of Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Wisconsin, and nearly the entirety of the state of Michigan in the United States. The average discharge below the Saguenay River is . At Quebec City, it is . The average discharge at the river's source, the outflow of Lake Ontario, is .\n\nThe Saint Lawrence River includes Lake Saint-Louis south of Montreal, Lake Saint Francis at Salaberry-de-Valleyfield and Lac Saint-Pierre east of Montreal. It encompasses four archipelagoes: the Thousand Islands chain near Alexandria Bay, New York and Kingston, Ontario; the Hochelaga Archipelago, including the Island of Montreal and Ãle JÃ©sus (Laval); the Lake St.Â Pierre Archipelago (classified biosphere world reserve by the UNESCO in 2000) and the smaller Mingan Archipelago. Other islands include Ãle d'OrlÃ©ans near Quebec City and Anticosti Island north of the GaspÃ©. It is the second longest river in Canada.\n\nLake Champlain and the Ottawa, Richelieu, Saint-Maurice, Saint-FranÃ§ois and Saguenay rivers drain into the Saint Lawrence.\n\nThe Saint Lawrence River is in a seismically active zone where fault reactivation is believed to occur along late Proterozoic to early Paleozoic normal faults related to the opening of Iapetus Ocean. The faults in the area are rift-related and comprise the Saint Lawrence rift system.\n\nAccording to the United States Geological Survey, the Saint Lawrence Valley is a physiographic province of the larger Appalachian division, containing the Champlain and Northern physiographic section. However, in Canada, where most of the valley is, it is instead considered part of a distinct Saint Lawrence Lowlands physiographic division, and not part of the Appalachian division at all.\n\nThe Norse explored the Gulf of Saint Lawrence in the 11th century and were followed by fifteenth and early sixteenth century European mariners, such as John Cabot, and the brothers Gaspar and Miguel Corte-Real. The first European explorer known to have sailed up the Saint Lawrence River itself was Jacques Cartier. At that time, the land along the river was inhabited by the St. Lawrence Iroquoians; at the time of Cartier's second voyage in 1535. Because Cartier arrived in the estuary on Saint Lawrence's feast day, he named it the \"Gulf of Saint Lawrence\".\nThe Saint Lawrence River is partly within the U.S. and as such is that country's sixth oldest surviving European place-name.\n\nThe earliest regular Europeans in the area were the Basques, who came to the St Lawrence Gulf and River in pursuit of whales from the early 16th century. The Basque whalers and fishermen traded with indigenous Americans and set up settlements, leaving vestiges all over the coast of eastern Canada and deep into the Saint Lawrence River. Basque commercial and fishing activity reached its peak before the \"Armada Invencible\"'s disaster (1588), when the Spanish Basque whaling fleet was confiscated by King Philip II of Spain and largely destroyed. Initially, the whaling galleons from Labourd were not affected by the Spanish defeat.\n\nUntil the early 17th century, the French used the name \"RiviÃ¨re du Canada\" to designate the Saint Lawrence upstream to Montreal and the Ottawa River after Montreal. The Saint Lawrence River served as the main route for European exploration of the North American interior, first pioneered by French explorer Samuel de Champlain.\n\nControl of the river was crucial to British strategy to capture New France in the Seven Years' War. Having captured Louisbourg in 1758, the British sailed up to Quebec the following year thanks to charts drawn up by James Cook. British troops were ferried via the Saint Lawrence to attack the city from the west, which they successfully did at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. The river was used again by the British to defeat the French siege of Quebec under the Chevalier de LÃ©vis in 1760.\n\nBecause of the virtually impassable Lachine Rapids, the Saint Lawrence was once continuously navigable only as far as Montreal. Opened in 1825, the Lachine Canal was the first to allow ships to pass the rapids. An extensive system of canals and locks, known as the Saint Lawrence Seaway, was officially opened on 26 June 1959 by Elizabeth II (representing Canada) and President Dwight D. Eisenhower (representing the United States). The Seaway now permits ocean-going vessels to pass all the way to Lake Superior.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the Battle of the St. Lawrence involved submarine and anti-submarine actions throughout the lower Saint Lawrence River and the entire Gulf of Saint Lawrence, Strait of Belle Isle and Cabot Strait from May to October 1942, September 1943, and again in October and November 1944. During this time, German U-boats sank several merchant marine ships and three Canadian warships.\n\nIn the late 1970s, the river was the subject of a successful ecological campaign (called \"Save the River\"), originally responding to planned development by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The campaign was organized, among others, by Abbie Hoffman.\n\nThe source of the North River in the Mesabi Range in Minnesota (Seven Beaver Lake) is considered to be the source of the Saint Lawrence River. Because it crosses so many lakes, the water system frequently changes its name. From source to mouth, the names are:\nThe Saint Lawrence River also passes through Lake Saint-Louis and Lake Saint-Pierre in Quebec.\n\nThe Saint Lawrence River is at the heart of many Quebec novels (Anne HÃ©bert's \"Kamouraska\", RÃ©jean Ducharme's \"L'avalÃ©e des avalÃ©s\"), poems (in works of Pierre Morency, Bernard Pozier), and songs (Leonard Cohen's \"Suzanne\", Michel Rivard's \"L'oubli\", Joe Dassin's \"Dans les yeux d'Ãmilie\"), and AndrÃ© Gagnon's \"Le Saint-Laurent\"). The river was the setting for the Canadian television drama series Seaway. The river has also been portrayed in paintings, notably by the Group of Seven. In addition, the river is the namesake of Saint-Laurent Herald at the Canadian Heraldic Authority.\n\nIn 1980 Jacques Cousteau traveled to Canada to make two films on the Saint Lawrence River and the Great Lakes, \"Cries from the Deep\" and \"St. Lawrence: Stairway to the Sea\".\n\nMusician David Usher released the song \"St. Lawrence River\" on his \"Little Songs\" album in 1998.\n\nThe novel and film Black Robe is set primarily on the St. Lawrence River during the 17th century.\n\n"}

SahagÃºn clarifies that their names are epithets of ÅmetÄcuhtli (literally \"two-lord\") and ÅmecihuÄtl (\"two-lady\"), giving as an alternate name of ÅmeyÅcÄn \"in tÅnacÄtÄcuhtli Ä«chÄn\" (\"the mansion of TÅnacÄtÄcuhtli\"). \n\nThere is some evidence that these two gods were considered aspects of a single being, as when a singer in \"Cantares Mexicanos\" asks where he can go given that \"Åme ihcac yehhuÄn Dios\" (\"they, God, stand double\").
